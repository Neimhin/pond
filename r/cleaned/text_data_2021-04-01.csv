0,2021-04-01,"  Thought still 2nd wave Next would 3rd. Wtf. president US? Really? Federal authority much much limited US, Germany even properly federation compared US. Germany, signs restrictions, closures, curfews entire country resistance local authorities. 

In US, president CDC recommend measures states. instance, president culdn't even enforce mask mandates Texas state government choosed otherwise. research also suggests hun It‚Äôs kinda anti-vax require physical precautions widespread vaccinations, no? places get virus peaks tourists show up. many diseases get attention tracking COVID gets. contagious disease ever massively traced PCRs international daily reports. Sars-CoV2 become super-mutating, opinion disappear stronger fashion flu. someone refused vaccinating happens getting, nevermind. opinion, circulate much flu mass vaccination campaign r/turtles  Bay Area orange tier (2nd lowest scale). faith people I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs thanks bois Pfizer Moderna üòçüòç homework would understand mRNA vaccine gives immunity would understand getting virus works exact mechanism there's absolutely zero reason think one produces immunity longer other. think injected fat, salt, sugar, RNA harm you... Constantly lying EU chauvinists spamming thread. 

When Europeans become ignorant. swear lived there. 

The Patriot act nothing vaccines. even know Patriot act does. 

It sounds scary, makes things sound plausible. 

What probably thinking defense production act. probably also think sounds scary ""defense"" it.

But *also* nothing imaginary vaccine export ban desperate believe exists. 

The defense production act allows US to, say, order Corning produce glass vials use vaccine production, order Merck Co. use facilities manufacture J&amp;J vaccine. 

But course there's export ban. US simply bright enough fund vaccine companies buy hundreds millions doses. 

The EU that. know why. That's question asking. Turtles way down? sequence lot tests.

Or (maybe) better quarantine cure long-term hosts. vaccinate health care workers, now. Brazilian government needs held accountable massive mishandling virus. president Brazil might worse response Trump did. Allies we're giving anything, (probably) buying it. I'm saying, scientifically, valid comparisons made three vaccines. useful, great do, J&amp;J might low efficacy two. 

Likewise, Pfizer Moderna tested time place J&amp;J, might similar results. 

So, comparing three vaccines useless exercise. Government funded mRNA vaccine research way vaccine came out. Tiers: critical patients healthcare workers everyone else.

that's effectively Texas did. Phase 1A started Dec. front-facing HC workers nursing home residents. cities &amp; counties also first responders like cops &amp; firefighters. Phase 1B started Jan. anyone age 18+ qualifying med condition... including BMI 30+ (some areas went low 25+). 

I mean hell, that's Texans, easily. good BBQ, Tex Mex meals prime beef available, pretty tough ""normal weight"" here. went first shot Jan., made sense HIPAA considerations precluded county workers asking conditions. 

Also qualifying conditions immediately visible casual observer. Diabetes sickle cell qualifying conditions here, would make little force somebody get blood-tested spot, waiting hours car shot (again, January). made people prove diabetes sickle cell, obesity, makes sense marginal cases could say ""yo I'm obese"" &amp; wear baggy clothes vax day. Slippery slope logical fallacy reason. seen Israel happened vaccinated 50% adult population

Israel 50% population *fully* vaccinated. US, number currently 16%.  might find helpful: Exactly. *At least* six months. fully vaccinated people large enough groups know anything past yet.   Considering much NWI (and rest Illinois) reliant city Chicago, we're collecting what's owed. many vaccines US export today? Pfizer's vaccine research entirely self funded precisely avoid something like this. last one needs die. even want wear mask planes over. issue continue to, want mandatory. 

The notions floating around travel never wildly depressing honestly starting piss off. We've got amazing vaccines, yes it'll take time reach every corner globe. end game. gotta be. EMA(EU regulator) still recommending AZ Germany that's deciding something different seem anything w/watching fear. thanks lidocaine idea. Heard '6 months' factoid manipulated. ask dr. Fauci disappointed Nats, come man  stop. 

There different recent studies UK, Israel US found Pfizer least effective trial. J&amp;J lowest bar efficacy them- counted moderate severe cases, trials looked symptomatic infections. think kind war going too? What‚Äôs frustrating people like difficult time getting appointments county rural Ohio can‚Äôt fill appointment slots. need better allocations. Even cost-cutting qr-code digital menus instead physical ones.  Apparently people ‚Äúown research‚Äù ‚Äúmind own‚Äù. cynical amongst us fully expect become permanent begin ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt permanent, couple years‚Äù know vaccines, later probably better. someone else getting first dose 2 weeks earlier high value.  three vaccines approved US useful. thing J&amp;J swapping efficacy convenience. Nothing wrong that's reality see it. good news J&amp;J people getting pretty good cell response relatively well variants Herd immunity eradication - we've ever eradicated one human disease (smallpox), notably animal reservoirs *and* spread without telltale obvious symptoms.

We herd immunity lots diseases, though, never spend much time thinking - things get vaccinated think due booster. realize broadway remained open, people played attended sports, schools person, bars restaurants open, life generally went duration pandemic, right? large scale lockdowns like experienced. small, local closures targeted places (e.g. pubs, churches) time -- weeks, months years. sick required quarantine, healthy. first time history ever done something like this. many idiots everywhere. Twitter Reddit share. much would love see idiots silenced, banning people sharing opinion (however stupid might be) could slippery slope. 

Content moderation extremely complicated job. don‚Äôt think anyone ever get right. mRNA vaccines tested new variants. really know well new variants. see say that's rationalization literally science. 

You literally compare three vaccines meaningful way. There's validity comparison.


Editing say: Also, point vaccine never get zero Covid cases. Even flu vaccine can't that. point vaccine limit severity infections get it, prevent serious illness, hospitalization even death. Removing residency requirement required federal government order get additional vaccines run 8 week vaccination clinic Gary high school. allow underserved area get additional vaccines. 2 thousand additional shots day available region. Ireland‚Äôs handling hilariously bad last months Thing is, either permanent lockdown (as say Canada is) robust test/trace/quarantine regime (like China does) reached zero COVID. There's in-between option COVID spreads around exponentially. 

Was Kenya non-stop lockdown past 13 months? Rwanda? Okay, fine, 100 years ago. got me. would mean time people age get vaccinated old people would need get vaccinated good news get vaccinated.

The bad news go Indiana. 

Honestly, tough call. I've tried like place, can't I'm antimasker sanctimonious turd

I doses vaccines wear one almost constantly public buildings 

Just want keep wearing one move past need keep dick hard make antimasker  US bans vaccine export.

This repeatedly debunked people keep repeating it. Yeah, I'd like see someone's plan finding vaccinating every bat, cat, dog, primate, pangolin, etc etc etc order eliminate this. There's bunch stuff vaccine kids today, suspect next goalposts shift. ""it's long, teens vaccinated, like saying young kids, months"" teens vaccinated, it'll thing kids. Id one two days sadness misery contribute stopping another years sadness misery that's fine me.  got first one Saturday. No, OP said, ‚ÄúCOVID changed life forever know it.‚Äù That‚Äôs first comment replied to. think he‚Äôs saying USA (moderna) Germany (biontech) even take sick day doctors appointments. go come back. loss anything book anything. Wait, there's DLC now? get it? still free monetized yet? matter reason behind this, matter fact basically doses exported

Yes, **reasons** matter. didn't, keep insisting export ban. 

And US block raw material exports either. interesting, assuming going continue update numbers technically extended trial? mean right vaccines $5 $25 per shot. That's huge profit center pharmaceutical companies, reason think get higher since vaccines approved next years. countries continued ongoing genomic sequencing throughout pandemic rather abandoning satisfied understanding original strain, variants would discovered lot quicker. Instead, two countries conducted ongoing genomic surveillance monitor variants mutations, sheer luck ones happened discover variants. P1 discovered Japan Brazilian travellers much analysis also undertaken aid UK. Areas high infection could absolutely crawling mutations allowed spread undetected. SA UK placed major emphasis persistent tracking study mutations, isn‚Äôt accident able discover analyse variants concern. risk covid least one, probably many, orders magnitude lower AZ blood clotting issue lowest-risk groups. Read symptoms clotting watch probably drop zero.

It well versus variants, assume people still tremendous protective immunity. guess maybe we'll get B.1.351 booster shot 6 months regardless vaccine got first matter much. Greece government declared deaths irrelevant meaningful investigation complete. board member pharmacovigilance commitee resigned today, stating mishandlings whole issue.

We may safe vaccine many willing choose mistrust. Yes.

It called Spanish Flu pandemic homework. US ""claim"" them. US *bought* them. 

Pretending understand distinction helpful. mean, asymptomatic flu absolutely thing, definitely know enough say can't give someone else without symptoms. 

Why go direction improving sick leave policies instead? Pfizer vaccine costs $20 shot. follow trace realize Reddit pro health measure place earth idea arguing support.

Good luck real world buddy.

Let say you

i refuse act stop minimal damage caused seasonal flu. Someone coronavirus recovers natural immunity. people vaccinated 1 dose, seem immunity variants even original sars 1 vaccine dose kind turbo charges prior immunity. Good news. Yes hun, that's says. got first shot too! Six Sigma one ""lean"" managing cults. ilk part reason there's real resilience global supply chain. mercilessly mocked quarters except cultists credential hucksters sell it.

Example mockery 20 years ago (when Scott Adams less prick): arm prob sore couple days otherwise good! hear second shot make feel sick... say means working! jesus wants u take shot US invested $18 billion vaccine development *and* manufacturing. would much prefer go direction plenty sick days rather masks sick. pass things coworkers, also rest bounce back faster. long don‚Äôt end homunculi. do, dibs Greed. I'm getting mine next week  selfish needed one time, there's obvious need, reasons believe temporary.


Asking people give another year already whits end, majority people make hospilizations vaccinated, calling selfish pushing far.

At point utilitarian. More, including kids, would hurt longer shutdown kids would hurt going back normal. asking majority put lives hold zero personal risk, interest few...who's selfish again? Meh thats simply said rationalization using J&amp;J. think J&amp;J fine especially covid wany little bit additional protection especially towards variants think one honest say equivalent MRNA vaccines. Maybe two doses two dose numbers early phase trials less par MRNA vaccines. ‚ÄúI refuse stop harming others.‚Äù

Would nice back least source. said UK, EU India. distinction make US unique? I'm seeing torrent Chicago. Astra vaccinations stopped Germany, however received first Astra shot March. Government saying likely second shot Pfizer. think efficiency mixed vaccine better worse breakdown 50/50. doses germany received far 70% BioNTech definitely need large faceless pharma-corps looking shoulder forcing us get latest ""patch"" every six months so. Disagree No, making assumptions data UK started vaccinating 16 - 65 year old vulnerable people mainly AZ useless trying draw conclusions 16 - 65 year olds vaccinated AZ. make place like Brazil worst covid outbreak started past months summer?

I thought interesting question researched bit. Brazil's flu seasonal far less US. Here's [a chart flu deaths derived CDC data. Instead modest decrease summer, US deaths plummet near zero.

Compare coronavirus, US cases went alarmingly high winter virus still spreading pretty well spring summer. I'm expert infectious disease, makes think coronavirus seasonal, strongly flu. Brazil's climate small effect flu effect coronavirus might negligible. true. nice hope.

Useless.

But nice. Makes perfect sense know Indian bureaucracy works India's leadership never prioritised Indians making decisions. part rest world would happy US lifted vaccine export ban sooner later. US covered way delivery. say 6 weeks? 6 weeks terms administration? Yes. usual India's leadership/bureaucracy failed Indians. Private sector beg lobby take part vaccination drive ffs. Given one complications COVID blood clots, vaccine tiny risk blood clots may well give net reduction number people getting blood clots. Spoken like tru moron. also 1 month bit, 2. basic math. 100k doses Germany, enough make difference. nothing reasonable guess, mate. giving almost exlusively pfizer young people middle february, resonable guess kept march. kinda tired dealing nationalist brits hate facts. present newer data, interested word salad. Sure NBC wants ratings ultimately it‚Äôs countries decide. countries DGAF TV ratings care tourism $$$. worry it. country flooded vaccine little enforcement ground. Yeah feel you, fevers brutal get them. Took panadol/neurofen kept coming back, consistently whole time otherwise. 

Congrats shot though little bit late here, think maybe issue disagree bigger impact COVID

I think pretty clear one hosting superspreader, personally contributed many deaths otherwise happened. Taking behaviors avoid seems prudent morally required. But, carrier COVID infect someone unknowingly supermarket, think morally culpable. seems like argument supporting fierce lockdowns la Australia (where even ability infect someone supermarket restricted) things like international travel, would possibly agree.

But, secondary point there's uncertainty happen. 5% chance hosting superspreader end infecting 100 people otherwise affected 3 die, hosting party expected caused-death count 0.15. But, immediate now. Whereas, climate change, positive things happen (say, carbon capture, improvements water desalination, etc) lessen impact there? I'm denialist means think take threat incredibly seriously. think ""discounting"" events future makes sense due uncertainty (this lot robotics algorithms work, example).

I think agree actually fundamentally overarching message well morality situation. seems disagreement mostly specifically COVID, think certain irresponsible actions demonstrably worse international travel.  dude harshing vaccine euphoria. seems conservative. Deliveries Biontech _double_ starting week (i.e. Biontech delivered April Jan+Feb+March together), Moderna also start deliver trace amounts. That's unfortunate situation purely speculative got less shifts cause called last week. Definitely bit jumping conclusions here. would know quarantined? told missing work due quarantine reason that's even legal.

You part time hours normally guaranteed. high school worked part time jobs weeks got two shifts weeks nearly worked every day. mean long ago 5 cases suddenly 30. Question actually gone data found vases ? found cases data looked at. Curious backfired food pyramid Well tone deaf. Bye. [Check ridiculous Somone simply pointed China single-day vaccination record, gets demolished downvotes highly voted comment saying ""Nobody trusts Chinese info.""

Come guys. I'm biggest critic China, logical. know large supply vaccines, Chinese vaccines sent around world. like they're hiding vaccines us. Plus, even record day China way per capita vaccination rate US. kind baseless nationalism really direction we're taking subreddit? You‚Äôre right, similarly longer see UK US desired allies, first time life I‚Äôm favor us joining EU European mutual defence treaty NATO. know Denmark bought extra doses Pfizer countries wanted AZ cheaper. Sweden too, lesser extent think. Norway Netherlands must done something similar. Mate, data two months out-of-date. Mate, make reasonable guess based available data. Mate. so? Increasing administrations per day? Husband going April 10 Chicago I'm going hoping leftover dose. can't find one, making assumptions old data useless making assumptions. entering country stay strictly controlled bubbles. going mingle general population different regular tourism. testing done daily cohorts kept within bubbles problem. get thiniking, I'm sure someone knowledgale respond. 

But, better community spread vaccinate likely gather? Like let's say vaccinated 18 40 year olds leaving younger older guard distance, wear masks, etc. make outside less infected *for* under/ vaccine groups? 

Of course background medical ethics, virology thoughts/ questions. Totally unnecessary opinion view. man Fauci's stature consider implications words around world making such. I'm saying doses mRNA, bit crazy think weeks billion people injected something brand new brand new science.

Sure hell hope long term negatives, one hell experiment. One single dose EU? is... gonna enough? Obviously Germany making recommendations reason. doubt would bother unless serious reason so. Show recent one. want live world every country needs vaccine supply line kan? expect i.e. Barbados commercial scale? US UK countries decided rather see foreigners die healthy compatriots fall sick. would Asian country allign West China, India Russian willing export vaccines US already threw Chinese bus leaving TPP. think Asian countries dont see US decided let Canada Mexico depend European, Chinese Indian vaccines despite largest trading partner? Check [Rite Aid's vaccine appointment around midnight. find couple spots night. also 2 months date. Gotta keem em alive pay back debt don‚Äôt know possible either, clearly Denmark getting 20% Pfizer Netherlands 20% J&amp;J.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know people go gym sick. ever met highly dedicated gym goer? people think taking day weak. 

Also, that‚Äôs gorgeous gym. Mate, interested claims. interested actual data. Yeah lots people Michigan heading south rn Got 1 dose J&amp;J 14 hours ago. Man it‚Äôs quite ride side effects. I‚Äôd say got bad around 8 hours peaked 12 13 hours. I‚Äôve vomiting since 10 hours in, dry heaving lot near 13 hour mark. Thankfully stomach seems settling now. along vomiting definitely everything else. Chills, fatigue, 100F fever, etc.

I definitely expecting this. worth noting stomach issues, similar acid reflux stomach overproduced acid take acid reducer every morning. wouldn‚Äôt surprised symptoms unique that. eat trigger food, similar experience vomiting, although typically never get point I‚Äôm dry heaving extended periods time.

Hopefully I‚Äôm side this. I‚Äôve got 1 year old grandparents never met 3 year old grandparents haven‚Äôt seen year. grandma major surgery couple weeks ago. Thankfully recovering well. I‚Äôm thankful get vaccine see family feel won‚Äôt around much longer.

This venting sit come side effects. 

I certainly hope immune response good enough last long lol. I‚Äôm curious 2 dose vaccines would similar side effects me. least it‚Äôs don‚Äôt worry getting again, least good while.

I wonder change formula mild ‚Äúbooster‚Äù shots reduce chances kinds side effects. know means stronger protection sheesh rough.

Alright think I‚Äôm done here. Anybody knows ask leftover doses Netherlands? fair, african countries tough call. might excess deaths, populations still increasing.

South Africa:
2018: +782,762
2019: +765,752
2020: +750,420

So might indicate missing 15 thousand population growth, despite virus, continuing overpopulate. could say: net effect virus barely published data vaccinations Group 6 opened included vulnerable people ages 16 65, mostly complete. group totalled 7.3 million since beginning March, AZ overtook Pfizer frequently given vaccine continuing pull ahead. think assume even without precise data including care workers previously vaccinated, multiple millions young people AZ vaccine UK. know two 30s myself. Maybe. could check /r/adhd see symptoms fit. Ultimately requires diagnosis medical professional, obviously. lots people get diagnosed adulthood. well 30s. wonder reddit would react used logic prioritize vaccinations anti-maskers Given believe AZ even applied approval yet (?), we're probably looking late April soonest shots could start hitting arms. I'm sure supply begin actually outstrip supply (I.E. daily doses given starts trending supply stays steady increases), seem like far away point. really expect we'll see many people getting AZ shots US. want effective take mRNA. want mRNA, seek J&amp;J effective single dose? 

Given that, really wish Biden would release whatever stockpile sitting warehouses neighboring countries. They'd make huge dent Canada, Mexico Caribbean. article states risks related thousands potentially unvaccinated foreigners entering country since vaccination requirement. 

Perhaps Japan decided make requirement every county vaccine access. 

That‚Äôs difficult situation. Keeping people way. Changing eligibility rules affect number available doses.

It's becoming quite clear though need vaccinate young people likely spread it, rather semi-vulnerable. Canadian justify rather healthy Americans fall ill Canadians die. I‚Äôm ready hear dissent. go college ohio live east coast. parents, extended family visit summer, vaccinated, I‚Äôve already contracted virus little symptoms don‚Äôt interest taking vaccine. subject taking vaccine virus presents risk older people might interact with? feel like risks long term consequence outweigh short term benefits. Interesting. lately yesterday, authorities said vaccination speed nothing money procurement, they‚Äôve bought everything available, Sweden bought less 1 dose vaccine, feels like media would made fuss it. 

The possible explanation think FHM cautious prognosis deliveries Norway. Mathematically, 1,25 million JJ doses Q2 matches general 2% allotment vaccines (JJ supposed deliver 55 million doses Q2). Great news EU standards. would utterly depressing projection other. Despite efforts government aides parliamentarians, President Jair Bolsonaro (no party) continues push measures oppose health recommendations curb spread Without mask, said use staying home. Minutes earlier ... Minister Health, Marcelo Queiroga, discouraged large gatherings. I‚Äôm imagining someone subdermal English muffin arm. Lol Thanks!
 got yesterday started 1 last night. Awful pain constant fever. worse annual flu shots. 
Cant wait over. probably listened folks said switch wait pfizer(my sis got arm pain) free show updated data age spread UK. many blood clots Pfizer vaccine caused period, odd last reports put higher Oxford vaccine none news coverage.

It's almost like profit company investors better lobbying team... Basically same. also used curfew go 8pm got dropped month ago. wife stuffed back office antimaskers last July. It‚Äôs extremely stressful. 

For forced go back office, don‚Äôt assume everyone going wear mask and/or get vaccinated. Likelihood right thing seems related much someone depends Facebook information. 

Good luck Like Greece also president. usually old person sits room drinking scotch waiting someone unlock door ask advice l Wow hard ‚ù§Ô∏è proved UK schools universities super spreader events keep closed open get damn kids vaccinated ‚ÄúWith promising news, may get semi-normal holiday season 2024‚Äù - Dr. Fauci Yeah, sarcastic, going November. Schools Kitas (kindergartens) opened then, follow much, since University kids. recommendations Germany only. suspect country recommendations sounds like AZ one available you. old data? looks quite date sinovac astrazeneca protection go 1 year? Ok thank you! goodys headache powder Lol tell NBC news, still won‚Äôt help. thought parades celebrate end WWI rally people buy war bonds 7 days might small level antibodies, even immune system still advantage adaptive immune response spike protein already motion got infected, antibodies cell-based immunity spike protein might start kick say 3 days infection whereas non-vaccinated individual might 7-10 days. could help shorten course infection. 

As actual data, figure 1A shows people previous Covid antibodies detectable antibodies 7-days post 1st dose Pfizer Moderna. also see Pfizer data day 8 showing basically nothing terms antibodies yet. Lord. find way get mRNA JJ vaccines world? vaccine looking like temporary stop gap production safer vaccines really ramps up. 20 days long time now. would check everyday see move up. live Florida. can‚Äôt imagine lockdown‚Äîeverything 100% open, good ill, governor said lockdown matter happens. 

I don‚Äôt know think. 

I assume people Ontario agree lockdown. hope psychological safety. I‚Äôd rather feel like I‚Äôm part solid solution trapped. looks like drug product bottleneck anymore, vial supply filling capacity. Actually good news, perhaps easiest problem fix. job pharmacy, check them. know employer looking get everybody vaccinated end week, got first shot Thursday. I‚Äôm hearing/reading it‚Äôs elderly/people care homes. It‚Äôs affecting middle aged people too. understanding is, quite cases blood clots presenting months patients dealt severe covid. Fauci needs shut AZ. appears biased. Wow, imagine going school europe...

Oh wait, that's lol. 
What people done....it's awful. Bro stfu eat way worse shit processed food. unironically write this, understanding basic economics. Like minimum? Mate, opened book since shool years, lmao. different normal blood clots? think blood clot disorder low platelets apparently much rare. likely send SWAT teams apprehend bring back. Why? Opening country please lobby groups.

Only hesitantly reimpose NPI due aforementioned lobby groups

Demand vaccines virus shit show EU.

Do get at.

Blame EU virus mess. mostly agree think countries they're pretty far US headed right now, includes touristic places. third world dealing well 2022.

Also, might bad marketing (we're together such). Precisely! I‚Äôve learned live smallpox, you?  catching train Busan dealing normal blood clots. rare combination thrombocytopenia blood clots. Remember smug new zealanders smug europeans smug canadians???

I'm sorry vaccine situation EU tried get $10 vaccine free lol. 

(I'm sorry) young people vaccinated imagine prevalence gone herd immunity matter reach high number like 80%. Infections year ago might protect new variant. mentioned countless times now. average blood clots. rare blood disease experience thrombocytopenia blood clots time. it‚Äôs anything like MN, don‚Äôt get choice per se, usually see vaccine signing making appointment online, choose 3 get way. Europe spends year mocking america virtue signaling

Europe now. vaccines. Disaster. :""wE nEeD wOrK tOgEtHer pLs"". CSVT incidence around 4 per million per year adults. 2 month period 18 million people, expect around 12 cases.

Although, CSVT affects predominantly younger people. actually, given people vaccinated (predominantly older), estimation may little high.

So 30 cases appear higher expected. Although, still incredibly rare, one death too. got second Moderna vaccine yesterday. It‚Äôs 5:30am I‚Äôm slowly dying. Body aches fever wazoo. expected get sick man body pains aches force reckoned with. Imagine thinking pandemic countries winning losing... 
Can't believe smug Americans thread again... im sorry the, 600.000 dead voted TV celebrity president This.. vaccine lowers chance bad/fatal outcome. since students real danger make sense either way.. infectious means exponentially people get people die result. bad news. Dummy example: Old virus: 20 dead 1.000 infections. New virus: 100 dead 10.000 infections. technology developed? getting Biden Like said One Perfect never Humanity resilient(Yes including people like) part program deliver Vaccines Countries cant remember name need people vaccinated hiccups that's delaying Patience dude doesnt wont matter things take time dude Try Challenge ""Muh American Made"" thinking End humans bleed embrace others Differences Imperfections thats lead Peace Make Utopias France 40% willingness get jab 64% mid March according polls.
To give details, hesitancy comes younger generations, guess part explanation must significant part don‚Äôt see benefits getting vaccinated assume virus wouldn‚Äôt affect (which bs highest order).
But older generations reported 90% willingness receive vaccine, especially +75 incidentally eligible get jab.
So despite noise, don‚Äôt uptake problem, now.
It likely case open rollout younger age groups trouble finding people inclined get vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt waiting lists right now. Well, yes struggle administer vaccines received yet. statement yesterday? Europe slow, also criticised rich countries horded vaccines. EU exported many vaccines received ourselves. 
Apparently damned damned don't. ignoring many years biontech research made vaccine days. Ofc phase 2 3 studies needed $$, research work done before.  Flu vaccine take-up UK (where article comes from) highest world. problem vaccine distribution UK, problem need slightly rejig vaccine every year based strain flu dominant year. it‚Äôs 25 additional cases two weeks, no? looks like it‚Äôs increasing rapidly UK too? It‚Äôs probably practical reasons. case rate PR doesn‚Äôt necessarily correlate mainland US don‚Äôt share open land border would make sense travel restrictions could apply one other. everyone America things great. /u/Brunoofbrazil okay? Actually no.

Accordingly PRAC report EMA, oral contraceptives increase risk 5.59x.

The AZ vaccine cases EEA Risk factor 8x **on top of** risk oral contraceptives. first dose far addition fatigue arm pain unbelievable 2 weeks still hurts move certain way lift something heavy. 

It's also probably unrelated (2 weeks all) couple dizzy spells day freaked I've never expetienced before.

I'm honestly dreading second dose. course viruses usually great concern elderly (and extremely weak), already compromised immune systems (serious) underlying health issues.

If fall categories, fine - otherwise, 8 billion humans Earth today bloodlines would've died centuries ago.

TL;DR I'm sure fine. Laughs Chinese* sure got numbers. round US pop 340 million, take 75% get 255 million.

Take 255 million, divide 2.9 million get 88 days. leaves us 3 months. Add month completing vaccination, sure, 4 months.

But count doses already administered. take account single shot J&amp;J vaccines. That's also accurate since there's AZ BioNTech. Yes absolutely true lol. talking doses produced given. Difference half production inside EU shipped countries. Including US. Also, younger people also far less prone die COVID-19.

The ‚Äúbenefits outweigh risks‚Äù clearly easy come 45. confirming produced amount doses ? Vomiting Fatal:2

That's Horrible History stuff. Also US given 154 millions. Since November Germany. country deaths young health care workers group? makes Norway different country - makes outlier. That‚Äôs data. Nothing personal Norway. Y‚Äôall gotta play factorio. course there‚Äôs bottleneck downstream. They‚Äôve increased throughput upstream job, i.e. keeping people safe, 'strategic move' hard find open appt Columbus area, Urbana 90 appts one day. willing drive bit, rural areas openings available. 
Someone else said get shot website. piece advice check back often regularly cancellations. appts available 9am, slew noon, nothing 1. Fantastic achievement also considering mountainous country Stop hoarding then! Read reviews paper.

There‚Äôs good reason it‚Äôs call ‚Äúpre-print peer reviewed ‚Äú symptoms vaccine besides sore arm I‚Äôm gonna kill anyone symptoms there‚Äôs that. friends get sick felt fine first two FUD. true. Also per capita much less EU anyway. regulators said identified 30 cases rare blood clot events use AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine - total 18.1 million doses.

Highly doubt that‚Äôs higher normal, background rate **Apr. 2, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

The CDC walked back Walensky‚Äôs comments New York Times.

Which means original estimates 60-70% herd immunity probably correct later revisions 85%+ probably overly conservative. Good news indeed. Freedom speech! Looking Chile, think full reopening yet possible without causing another wave strain hospitals again. know sounds like moving goalposts, reassuring news vaccines far causing herd immunity, example. need make sure keep sufficient doses instead exporting it. title post wrong. title article says ACCESS vaccine. article Dewine says vaccination clinics campus help college students ‚Äúchoose receive vaccine.‚Äù Well J&amp;J 66% area SA variant Pfizer showed 91% variant.

Still, need make decisions continuation every day. share source dAta? 

In addition it‚Äôs important weigh risk vs benefits here. 2.2mm people left unvaccinated numbers would end seriously ill requiring hospital treatment, ICU worst dead higher suffering clots. 

It‚Äôs prudent cautious however vaccine ever 100% safe, even standard vaccines receive serious side effects made conscious decision society accept risks. AZ vaccine benefits display success Uk enjoying vs Europe. means brexiteer! 

By smearing vaccine safe 99.5% people sowing doubts benefits &amp; safety, strongly outweigh risks, actually run risk reducing vaccine update whether AZ, Pfizer brand. already walked back.

""In cooperation Norwegian National Unit Platelet Immunology found specific antibodies platelets results symptoms, know areas medicine, drugs cause""

So found mechanism work, occurred multiple patients received vaccine, never seen except drugs cause, patients drugs could explain it. must pretty remarkable coincidence first time saw symptoms occur naturally, multiple patients happened received vaccine.

The journalist, ""unreliable"" newspaper, keeps pushing asking highly probable, can't cause. keeps replying sure, know vaccine cause.

And see could argue went goal proving vaccine cause.

Did know Anthony Fauci March 2020? No. probably remember March 2030 either. No, dose same. Every vial contain tiny bit extra liquid account dead space syringe. good syringe low dead space used, use extra liquid extra dose. assume already done many situations, official FDA policy. AZ use stabilized spike protein J&amp;J, Moderna, Pfizer use (which created US NIH). definitely less effective vaccine stable spike protein. Even CDC said gatherings amongst vaccinated people OK. see PayPal transaction leads identity theft. get name, email, address, exactly information need open credit card access bank accounts anything.

My vaccination record (a sheet paper) county health department operation shows info vaccine itself, dose given, name signature person gave shot. personal info needed. makes sense.

Fun(ish) fact: Validation documented evidence process performs consistently, is, within preset ranges preset outcomes. change production requires revalidation. done several ways, ultimately test show change production process negatively impact end product specifications. case change flask size (say used cool solution rotovap), process may already validated range sizes used. update validation would come wanted go outside range increase production, per se. Janssen Pharmaceuticals pharma company developed vaccine, wholly-owned subsidiary J&amp;J. I'm going go ahead listen one top infectious disease experts rather random internet. people live reality man. Still. Thank you. üòÄ mean wrong looking 90% efficacy, J&amp;J figured pretty early going get vaccine others. needed differentiate (especially AZ looked leader early on) decided try one dose. definitely less effective, one dose option really useful logistical concerns. Everyone spreading misinformation variants must absolute shambles right now.

How team COVID recover this? Also last days Brazil new daily cases decreased slightly. maybe turning corner current surge. first dose Moderna couple weeks ago. overnight fever night sweats, woke really dehydrated. drank much water waking issues. Fever went away pretty quickly. You‚Äôre eligible get vaccinated Indiana don‚Äôt luck state. residency restriction gone. least go room home close door. office I‚Äôve got Jim 2 feet away doesn‚Äôt know shut 5 seconds thinks I‚Äôm randomly answer questions. Move out. can't tell really good troll surge stupidity taken over. Almost everyone know (early 30‚Äôs) getting vaccine next week. 

I taste end. I‚Äôm hoping society willing eventually write hell bent getting vaccine. think still *try* get everyone vaccinated, people shouldn‚Äôt hold back everyone dutifully given year life. Maybe read article headline? oversimplification 95% people susceptible virus zero state soon 1) recovering, 2) dead, 3) vaccinated (or anti-vax). state, 6,860 dead 521,667 positive cases (1.3%), 94% deaths (6,424) people 60 years old. 12 people age 30 died. 

COVID's lethality frightening (assuming people get hospital). potential spread control break hospital's business model issue. infrastructure hospitalize everyone once. us touched covid/vaccination, wildfire spread cease. Vulnerable parts population passing away sadly contribute ceasing, human populations start ""favoring"" people resistant covid (favoring anthropomorphic evolutionary sense, intentionally course). OH college student, already got first dose last weekend! They‚Äôre using university vaccination site pretty much everyone know either gotten scheduled first dose. People get irrationally annoyed say AZ discontinued people wait Pfizer think better waiting better vaccine rushing take inferior one that's going really move needle much long run quite true. Yes, dosing nearly 3M per day close 1% population. doses split 1st 2nd shots. half shots reached new people, half go people already ""vaccinated"". Hence vaccination progress really 1/2% per day.

We're good we're even half way through. That‚Äôs peaked last year. Looking least years slope, solid immunity, nothing like March/early April ‚Äò20. FDA website

This weekend marks first holiday since pandemic started messaging ""whatever plans are, cancel them."" Forget cases. Canada never tested anywhere near much US has. cases severely undercounted. choice, I'd rather vaccine shown still effective 6 months afterwards variants, like Pfizer, known effective date. ask someone would choose, right? one extra hour time. course, get available. Novavax game changer 30 population. expect 30‚Äôs 40‚Äôs continue receive mix AZ PF May. (though it‚Äôll interesting see AZ blood reports get attention 50‚Äôs refuse) might true new vials. said current existing vials ok 11 doses instead 10. definitely overdosing before. spoken two doctors know, talk EUA process. That's question.

That's turned Reddit, seems others know either.

If two doctors know, optimistic CVS pharmacist, never helpful simple questions I've (like, take morning evening, ha).

Your suggestion contact FDA might next step, bad idea works, give try. Thanks bud. term ""ban"" used figuratively. US explicitly banned exports, require federal approval developed part federal funding.

And naturally, basically vaccines anyone developing vaccine planning manufacture US said yes receiving asked Biden administration let loan American doses European Union, fallen short original supply commitments vaccination campaign stumbled administration, now, denied request, one official post mine deleted saying vaccine clearly causing issue. statement based post said researchers found mechanism caused it. seems logical conclude researchers found mechanism causes issue, also must mean vaccine cause.

The moderators see way, deleted post. thinking posting communication /r/subredditdrama. allow sorts conspiracy posts EU trying tear non-profit AZ vaccine, delete logical conclusion topic post commenting on. RIDICULOUS! really dumb. got vaccinated Pfizer.

Serbian btw. I'm glad Uruguayans much better vaccination situation though, population 3.5M 18% 60 years old older. I've told vaccination available every age right Uruguay. live Rio Grande Sul, close Uruguay let tell wish could take visit vaccinate hahah... get least let data come mass vaccinations really rollout. best stat far comes nursing homes, compromised danger individuals. Plus seen cases hospital admissions slowly rise reopenings. ICU Death stats still low lag behind case increases 2-3 weeks. 
Less half adults 50 without one dose small statistic. cant ignore that. Yet every US state full vaccinations 16 end month. clrealy working strategy let April pass. That‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs still hard find one. I‚Äôm 60s I‚Äôve waiting list several months county. Tried Kaiser yesterday open 50 above. currently appointments. I‚Äôll keep trying. need specific qualifications want challenge determinations health experts want taken seriously. agree though, sub need exist, become echo chamber people sad live pandemic decided ""I'm sick this, therefore over,"" preferable dealing accepting reality.

The argument provided health experts disagree OP. That's argument. disregard opinions people experts field would opinion mean anything anyone rich countries' interest help everyone get vaccinated ASAP. longer virus allowed run loose, likely mutate insta-killer like 1918 flu did. Yeah, remember everyone crossing fingers hoping would work all, even considering 70% ""realistic best case scenario"" I'm renting car Chicago driving 2 hours. care. want get stop refresh 15 different websites daily. lot people Chicago thing am. anyone advice coming compromise members household deep ‚Äúdistance/stay home even vaccine‚Äù bandwagon?

I‚Äôm ok wearing masks, I‚Äôm ok avoiding large gatherings, would want work in-person year, since wi-fi isn‚Äôt reliable enough WFH. dosed level tested shown safe effective. Later tests showed lower doses still effective. Nothing wrong that. Waiting months optimize would crazy thousands people dying every day.   
   
Unfortunately early trials accurate need tens thousands volunteers getting dose can‚Äôt test people different dosing levels. October 10th Toronto  way could stood 6 months complete utter disaster.  generally correct.

Hi, medical device regulatory professional here, previously worked production quality contract pharmaceutical manufacturing well. Manufacturer's must supply design documentation, production process information specific device/drug, information quality systems (these established business processes maintain compliance regulations monitor business improvement). formula list instructions, equipment, materials. Design regulated tightly requires much documentation. Clinical analytical study data specifically designed test limits drug medical device. clinical efficacy studies, limit detection quantitation studies, studies identify impurities, studies make sure every piece production equipment used process compatible drug leach unwanted chemicals. studies done glass vials filling, quite relevant here.

When comes getting supply glass vials, walk park either drug/device manufacturer. find suitable supplier, qualify them. means audit supplier quality systems production processes ensure providing say are. Certain suppliers drug process like considered critical, material supply ends ""backbone"" product direct impact patient user. suppliers require higher level scrutiny product depends performance material. Glass vials fall close risk level ""product contact"" materials direct impact stability impurity formation. 

So see shortage medical supplies raw materials, much production materials come play. may vials there, may produced standards needed supplier can't prove bad systems place document compliance regulations. 

All this, course, interest public health safety, feels bit odd impeding public health safety.

Atm 20.000.000/120.000.000 contracted. seems next quarter numbers rise significantly. lot national health agencies apparently disagree assesment pros cons. vulnerable person could continue take extra precautions. know sucks vulnerable people, that‚Äôs truly they‚Äôve living every flu season already. don‚Äôt see sense stopping everyone reasonable social interactions sake small percentage people always fear covid. information wife protect herself!! Again, treatable already available drug. need aware get following receiving COVID-19 Vaccine  -  - pain chest  - swelling coldness  - severe worsening headache blurred vision  - persistent  - multiple small bruises, reddish purplish spots, blood blisters skin, got second dose yesterday. Hit like freight truck morning. J√° sei. Quis s√≥ abrir uma perspectiva + abragente. Blz? experience. sore arm dose 2 felt super quick. admittedly little suspicious whether even infected. made higher proportion infections widespread. new variants deadly young,lol put many thoughts 95 vs 91% always confidence intervals involved natural randomness produces slightly different results every time. Lol see refused admit is, cuz know wrong still prefer freedom someone else's life... pathetic that's humans act, interests Hasn‚Äôt dude wrong like every turn? I'm really enjoying i've triggered every coronavirusUK mod. Enjoy little echo chamber. think Vox makes good argument here. Sure, can't directly compare efficacy rates reasons gave, there's strong evidence (including finding topic) mRNA vaccines *are* superior.

While society's interest keep serious infections deaths minimum, individual incentive *not let infection take root all*. short-term well-being avoiding symptoms, also avoiding possible long-term complications; things like possible link HSV-1 dementia mononucleosis idiopathic hypersomnia. low risk spreading. True, never said were. joke funnier. Saying ""it's quasi-effective"" key.

Considering low efficacy variants, led South Africa get rid share AstraZeneca, justified.  That's true, could've much worse, still great. Glad see continuous increase seniors. 2 weeks 1st Pfizers shot 33% (Israeli/Harvard study) - 50% (Pfizer's clinical study) efficacy.  think 33% closer real number recorded uk variant spreading. Stupid people: oh yeah? America waves! USA USA USA lol yet, ER space available whole time, unlike, say, Seattle, NYC, LA, Houston, Boise, Detroit, Chicago... higher statistical chance kill isolated depressed lockdowns covid killing me. 5x likely. Yes, checked it. thank care health continue best me. sucking? explains lot numbers. Enjoy future lockdown. good news complication treated. aware it, danger her. EU restricting AZ vaccine youger people probably change absolutly nothing timetable vaccination

It absolutely will, countries starting vaccinate &lt;60, including essential workers, etc.

The pros far outweigh cons. Yes putting liquid vial changes surface area volume ratios things highly temperature sensitive. two months proving didn‚Äôt mess vaccine this. Cinco de mayo could Sunday, I‚Äôm still getting margaritas tacos Yes. You‚Äôre likely get hurt car.

These good vaccines. smart enough calculate risks somewhat accurately. 

As someone one hottest place covid world twice point, I'd love believe that, really :( Even first dosage cut transmissions significantly,

OH well found little bit bellow, means protection achieved **28 days initiation vaccination**, consists 2-dose schedule. like national local governments, entity would imposed lockdowns, 'cause work save lives effective measure pandemic population gets vaccinated. One us! One us! fortunate become statistic. Chances small one unlucky, could bad...like kill bad  read article titled ""The Summer World Came Back"", headline made start crying. cannot upvote answer enough.

Sick leave answer, universal masking. There‚Äôs plenty us best.

For past year I‚Äôve captain ventilation windows, made sure masks stocked, made sure colleagues quarantining travel exposure, stuff.

Now, I‚Äôm advising people continue cautious, change definitions ‚Äúcautious.‚Äù unvaccinated going crowded bar dumb, inviting vaccinated person house gone crowded bar reasonable. We‚Äôve pretty much stopped wearing masks work, though aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfully vaccinated,‚Äù we‚Äôre ways first shots.

There lots people world want scolds, always wanted people safe, contribute public health crisis, personal health issues.

The past year changed lot outlook permanently: face masks something I‚Äôll keep handy variety reasons, ventilation still something I‚Äôll care about, I‚Äôll probably encourage quarantine behavior influenza exposure.

But don‚Äôt keep acting like there‚Äôs public health crisis isn‚Äôt. didn‚Äôt even notice second third I‚Äôm gay üòê Since two similar basically studies done two almost always came similar results two likely that's case, yes. total number course. Maybe info available, I'm willing dig - yet.

My wife got az ago (no problems course) intends take az second shot well. I'm fairly certain rare complication non issue us, bit information would welcome. Funny enough, got Biontech/Pfizer vaccine one az, based age gender. see handle chaos near future. book flight US - bit hassle ample capacity now. 100% effective? would love vaccine passports thing..hoping EU requires this. projected fall behind heavily end Q2 ministry health barely ordered (one-shot) J&amp;J. That's AT,SLO CZ voted initial proposal account projected vaccination rates all. Instead negotiating Germany put pressure Portugal close subject simply cutting 3 dissidents redistribution program. frame like program anonimous decision contribute despite decent vaccination rate, even though AT's vaccination rate start plummeting soon, punish Kurz bringing uneven vaccination rates. (Main Sources: Vaccine projections, Babi≈°) Wow, guess shows different regions country are. NJ, cases up, many people know still eligible recently eligible vaccine, Google see movie theaters even open since considered going. (They are, 35%.)

I ready over. fAuCi sAiD dIdN‚ÄôT NeEd WeAr mAsKS Sorry, poor phrasing. meant Miami/OU safeties people getting OSU. Yeah entire family Pfizer shot #1 week ago. 
We going maskless indoors first time year. 
In fact, getting vaccine first time I‚Äôd stepped building year, unless count 15 seconds passed corridor work once. need ""health care professionals"" inject vaccine? could train someone inject COVID vaccine hours. even find vein type injection, poke anywhere shoulder press plunger. could probably even self-inject mirror bit practice.

Its another example credentials inflation - requiring advance degree something could done almost anyone. Something tells aren‚Äôt exactly swimming puss...üòÇ wonder many 10% due user error like ineffective vaccine due stored properly. stroke reading lmao Yeah don‚Äôt get it. What‚Äôs motivation get vaccinated still everything before? know r/Europe r/EU haha? Remember 48% people UK voted remain younger population (that tend use Reddit) voted heavily remain.

Perhaps propaganda peddler  Maybe fun camp sort. can‚Äôt nice things. idk maybe people shitty 1+ year worry, stress, frustration, fear, etc there‚Äôs hope fingertips via vaccination want share moment relief others. That's shame. .01%, suggest, would better society It‚Äôs kind hilarious loudest anti-science crowd ones begging anti-maskers trust science year ago. 

Wait say hilarious? Sorry meant disgusting According bloomberg almost 4 million vaccinations already registered given today. but... what's logical protect us? ;) 4% world's population lives USA. get new variants concern coming pipeline, solution make new boosters mRNA technology. Trying vaccinate everyone entire world going take decades. started vaccinating Polio 60s still reached worldwide herd immunity that, though happily getting close. polio vaccine also way shelf-stable compared covid shots. got first dose Pfizer Monday. 

I'm really curious, assuming get infected COVID today, likely symptoms would less severe since vaccine 4-5 days ago? early vaccine helped much all? tell mom simple words vaccine isn‚Äôt ‚Äúinjecting covid?‚Äù She‚Äôs stubborn malicious, she‚Äôs fallen Facebook misinformation vaccine I‚Äôm bit sad family. next week, every adult member family vaccinated, higher-risk 2+ weeks past 2nd dose already. birthdays coming up. heavy news-watching family members still scared they‚Äôre unsafe agree meet 2-3 people. Looking like another spring canceled celebrations us. :( really hope keep seeing shift ‚Äúyes, vaccinated people really things‚Äù messaging move forward. Already COVID, unimpressive anticipated. 99.9% btw. This.

Lungs force 100% air exchanged. thing called Residual volume reserve amount left over. 

If inhale virus walking airport, unmasked, could exhale group possibly unvaccinated people.

I can't get infected virus, could potentially spread it. 

I'll hang mask, TYVM, although I'll probably go back cloth masks-- Spartan Teammate made amazing masks us beginning Covid.

I like humans much randomly spread sickness. I‚Äôm Philly too. rite aid get shot at? government bought 12M vaccines imported India (4M already delivered), yes, Fiocruz, Brazilian Laboratory, also producing vaccine house imported ‚Äúingredients‚Äù.

[This goes throughout vaccines bought many delivered. know said many times best time day call around looking extra doses? Also anyone luck getting leftover doses independent pharmacies mostly big chains end extras? I'm LA county I'm hoping might able snag one 15th, I'm kind expecting difficult get appointment little that. Thanks! surpassed point 100 million individuals least one vaccine. fantastic! look forward seeing number people vaccinated continue go up!  ""Totally safe"" goal. Moderna Pfizer sterilizing serology, difficult time becoming infected all, much lower virus serum do. Sure we're giving 2 doses person still .5% per day, regardless effectiveness. saw woman wearing 2 masks, nose. gotta wonder. assumes virus becomes first respiratory virus humans managed eliminate. Considering people, including children, die flu every year, doubt ever get 0 corona deaths. PANDEMICS OVER!!!! heard first, u/basketball.

Actual Expects Surge Vaccinations Keep 4th Coronavirus Wave Bay  Yes, variant killing ‚Äòfaster‚Äô young people. increase 50%! Alarming right? 

For males 0-34, study‚Äôs fatality rate baseline 3.1 100,000, B.1.1.7 variant 4.7 reference, number auto fatalities per 100,000 population Canada 5.0 2017; lowest record. thing - year pandemic sorts headlines narratives leaving less less trust Public Health information.

Covid dangerous. possible fatal young people, variants increasing severity - without actually sharing increase is, sounds worse is. Could Lockdowns intense, truly intermittent short, huge drain everyone. 

I highly doubt find anywhere close number countries shuddered businesses full year. thread provides many examples article. interesting read. Definitely think UK incorporate little write-ups interesting pathologies. Also, like graphs comparing incidence vaccines. Oh good point. I‚Äôm following couple different comment threads I‚Äôm losing track we‚Äôre discussing. 

I personally would socialize fully vaccinated, guess don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs like awful thing ever long everyone least two weeks past first shot. Either way, think reducing socialization even fully quarantining (beyond work requirements) two weeks afterwards still makes sense. UNH Dartmouth advocate like wild student population.

Our government really good worst. zip code? use turn website? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, live 10 minute walk office. I‚Äôve already going back there, it‚Äôs crazy much get done bed isn‚Äôt two feet away desk. since whole thing started. That's probably intention  Immunity doesn‚Äôt expire.yes, boosters needed mRNA technology amazing. ""To attend gatherings, people either tested show proof full vaccination. California administered nearly 19 million doses nearly 6.9 million people fully vaccinated state nearly 40 million residents. people 50 eligible statewide get vaccine now. Adults 16 older won‚Äôt eligible April 15.""

Works baby, let's fucking rage! first one never ended lets honest Newsom getting recalled. Basically reopen accelerated New York California governors facing political danger. looks like US shy 30M doses distributed week, pending tomorrow likely around 28.5-29M, US likely around 350M distributed end month pace continues steadily increase, Mid-May enough every person y/o. without even including AstraZeneca's reserve Novavax.

I really want know US huge supply secure enough every american... *prays mexican* expect 55+ able sign appointments phizer moderna vaccines.

Some hospitals Toronto already 50+ mean ultra super mega spreader event April 2021?

(I hope wrong, tens thousands people indoors sound like smart thing.) No, that‚Äôs one aspect. actual efficiency individual level certainly plays role. efficiency 50%, herd immunity / population effects would dominate. vaccine 100% efficient cases (and mRNA vaccines certainly close), individual effects start dominate. really work, people get pissed things get worse after, talking personal experience, neighbors stay night street drinking making noise (music/screams etc) often every time someone's birthday holiday.... asking talking makes change, Covid business usual...... post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

And clear that's *bad*. 20% still 1 5. add infected still spread might realize, already Covid 'feature' vaccine lower symptoms even more, basically playing Russian Roulette (with worse odds) people's lives without damn clue.

It's choice gamble people's lives health like that. Oh no! terrible cough! like stay angry, find relaxes me. anyone drive vaccine? live Cal lot developing countries projected complete vaccinations 2023. That's still several years slowed development. US may send Mexico since share big border, many countries left behind. They're already getting vaccinations much later developed world. ... 4th wave? first ever end? yes updates best Virginia 4/18. needed shout rooftops family fully vaccinated finally see parents haven‚Äôt since covid except couple minutes distance I‚Äôm happy could cry!!! Good luck everyone trying get vaccinated. Don‚Äôt give up, get this! Chinese numbers backed korean statistics. Similar amount people US China enters country, yet China export mere fraction covid cases. Harsh lockdown high covid cases go together, even need look China known Damn hoping we‚Äôre going teach wisdom, guess I‚Äôll lost soul forever still talking partially vaccinated people? fully? enough testing vs adequate testing question suspect we'll waiting strong correlation got CVST would also extreme reactions (likely die) catching covid-19. would change equation dramatically. proves tourism parasitic industry cannot basis functioning economy Yep, reality shaming really nothing this. worth effort, especially now. Doesn‚Äôt expect fourth wave bombarded border. ü§î Anyone still shaming people dead  acting like whole time. Saw video today local University strip bars restaurants are. Lines around buildings get in, already packed crowds. Mostly.

The ones feel right receiving shot anyways.  Although uncommon get wrong flu shot, actually get sick. yes exciting news also don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much say healthy, low-risk, vaccinated people spend time healthy, low-risk, vaccinated people long they‚Äôre going hang high-risk unvaccinated people weeks after. Correction: nothing data *yet* would indicate jump danger. 

Also, I'd respectfully point many would consider 226 innocent children losing lives heavy price pay. beacon Hope window could Enlighten Considering much he‚Äôs consistently wrong may well mean fourth wave better start thinking risks exposed normal life.  return saved hundreds thousands lives. employed world class contact tracing genius idea isolating sick quarantine hospitals. result Chinese people enjoyed great personal liberty able live life without restrictions virus largely nonexistant outside localized outbreaks. balancing act. I'd certainly take approach American one day. We've done pretty damn well Denmark, - well China, Vietnam, Taiwan like. We've live relatively soft lockdown (in comparison places) since December - places quite lucky. France instance draconian curfews ages seeing surging cases regardless. I'd personally rather get fast possible that.

That harsh lockdown Wuhan greatly restrict freedom people living there, yes. ultimately led billion people able live lives largely normally year lockdowns restrictions elsewhere. Can't say I'm fond degree tracking do, definetely things could learn point. we'd acted immediately instead acting like impervious could like Vietnam - basically living great border restrictions life largely unimpaired inside.   Okay there, big fella.  Honestly that's lot places. Obnoxious certainly unique Maine Thats American Exceptionalism you. Cant handle another country better invent BS conspiracy theories. great all... happens immunity expires 6 months received second dose? booster, guidance.... guess we‚Äôre back quarantine. vaccine work me? Educate yourself. Luckily countries plan traveling soon (going Iceland June) requiring proof vaccination. Also I'm talking international travel. work mandating vaccine worries + continue work remotely last year date. Sir, 10 people. /s yes great news I'll never work office again, COVID. get much work done home, prefer flexibility enjoy more. Luckily company already said choice, they'd mandated us back office, I'd quit. I'm going lose job want work home, blanket thinking going happen short sighted. agree. don‚Äôt think vaccine passports bad idea (nor infringement freedom), also agree looks like they‚Äôll end unnecessary anyway. unvaccinated aren‚Äôt really hurting anyone get point everyone wants vaccine chance get it. exceptions would children people health issues. Children nearly 0 risk anyway always been. others, seem immoral marginalize token, that‚Äôs extremely small number people make huge societal change for.

In end there‚Äôs zero chance something like would ever fly US anyway. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll see odd attempt require vaccination activity, it‚Äôll never stick people stop trying soon enough. that‚Äôs crazy?!? /s far aware, vaccine prevent getting virus simply reduces chances develop moderate critical symptoms. Perhaps answer question?

People vaccinated likely house things. Vaccine resistant variant. There‚Äôs already one think. god people believe every single thing hear reddit huh? Gotcha! Misunderstood thats u meant. Thanks explaining! *Classic* basically enough vaccine (or month so) 2 doses helps variants. Initially, wasn‚Äôt convinced think it‚Äôs right call. misleading headline. That‚Äôs article says. developing mutations enable evade immune systems effectively, leaves younger people better immune systems vulnerable Impending doom. words CDC directors throw around lightly, methinks. think HIV patients also shouldn‚Äôt legal obligation tell sex partners HIV sex?  Go look up. Go learn something. lot people Chicago driving city get vaccinated. Indiana downstate commonly. last friends get vaccinated finally got first dose way. Chicago's rollout frustrating confusing there's much available supply outside city. entirely Chicago's fault, Lightfoot made lot awful decisions pandemic. get sick? hard. makes total sense, guess left common sense bed morning lol . I‚Äôll continue trusting doctors evidence, believe whatever want Tomorrow sure! 

I'm starting think 100M shots month April totally doable. I've traveling whole time ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è petty bureaucrat interview yesterday stated think public health measures prevent people living ‚Äòwhole life‚Äô- boring calm sober.

Good luck airplane. Pfizer doubt. handle cold actually knocked pretty bad 24 hours FDA officially approved yet approval process arduous slow. approved eventually EUA provided experiencing global pandemic thousands dying daily. Putting administrative burdens waiting approval traditional approval process would cost United States minimum tens thousands lives. 

You purposely obtuse safety efficiency vaccines based know right now.  make seem like flu taking precautions nothing Gotcha, thanks reply. dude worried 1/100k risks stop driving predict mask requirements flights go away? don‚Äôt think next year earliest, honestly wonder it‚Äôs stay. husband optimistic me. turned year old won‚Äôt wear mask 9+ hour flight (as hard I‚Äôd try) live abroad would love see family I‚Äôm vaccinated. Best flight path American Airlines they‚Äôre one strictest kids masks comment thread pass vibe check.

Latent antisemitism cool, folks. else going get approved kids? can't start giving vaccine kids without testing small number. That's good point. ""Once vaccinated, pandemic personally"" bad messaging. strictly accurate, risk transmission low ""managing pandemic"" standard, less true. I'm getting first Pfizer Sunday. I'm gaining 5% anxiety every day. Talk expat China realize life back normal months. compare tragedy countries like U.S. laughable. FYI, Fauci info interviews saw Aug 2020 March 2021 - sure official site anywhere. info [John Hopkins sidebar.

I'm sure somewhere official page, mounds everywhere *very* hard find particular piece moment (sadly). agree here... life idea people stan hard him. spring break then? positivity rate check wave 3 curve. Schools closed. Yup great...  least 8 months. study published really enough data say much longer. seem case here, since post much better recent posts Brazil. distinction except degree. None words well defined, they‚Äôre certainly technical terms epidemiology. OP talking nonsense. funny it‚Äôs way around lol Well low risk transmitting virus/getting sick, care masks making sure I‚Äôm small crowd? People telling I‚Äôm OK I‚Äôm vaccinated, care wear masks then? haven‚Äôt left house without one year. happy US government this. disagree something mean right prosecute ""bring in"". Vaccines spoil us fingers crossed! That's.... Really really dumb make that. condolences... author didn‚Äôt ask one question wanted answered. Yale educated journalist writer this? assume intelligent smart person must know wrong. Doesn‚Äôt Yale Ivy League colleges take smartest people only? knows wrong point ""errors"" ""mistakes"" become deliberate lies. would human KNOWINGLY LIE LIFE SAVING VACCINES PANDEMIC?

This needed answered. cautious sister waiting exact recommendation letting vaccinated parents visit.

lol clear fine well CDC said so, let parents visit anyways. Ya business doesn‚Äôt want anyway going protest kind silly need decide risk level acceptable. me, 91% reduction chance infection acceptable.

There's low chance get multi car accident every time drive accept low risk fingers crossed access opens y'all! still inhale exhale virus, therefore spreading infecting people, even though vaccinated probably get sick. Yeah, especially since goal get virus R0 = 3 R0 &lt; 1.

90% 3 .3, WELL level virus naturally die out. upvotes

Search ""Brazil"" sub sort new. Recent posts mostly dozens hundred upvotes, one actually better normal. Dartmouth Ivy way Vandy SEC school. mean, yeah, technically...

/s, kind of... 566,000 deaths 31,250,000 cases US = 98.39% ...right old people never die flu.

In reality exposing him, parents, years risking flu them. vaccinated way effective wearing mask terms preventing transmission. necessary. That's CDC says vaccinated people gather low-risk unvaccinated people without masks.

From policy perspective, real way verify vaccination still require masks everyone. oh yeah totally unrealistic require 100 percent vaccination going back normal. gotta remember got like first place, prevent every single case ever Praying Saint Anthony he's right small group friends super careful weren't, respected fact still cautious meet they'd gathering not. 

Until got vaccinated ended spending night three people who'd partied hard weekend (in country lockdown 20 want hang anyone work sleepover). trust severely violated see 90% less chance infected would make less important. Yep, everything showing vaccine effective becoming infected able transmit virus there. may want get big gathering together unvaccinated people sake, comfortable hanging anyone want to. 

It's probably safe go things again, wear mask required to, fine super low likelihood getting sick able spread virus. NH thinking want bunch people Mass coming grabbing appointments. last wave unemployment end thus lot people reapplied? 


Also, since people need actively looking work get unemployment lot NEETs students applying wouldnt normally eligible Europe still major issues healthy 30W, chance get vaccinated autumn still finish 80+ generation Given NYC wayyyyyyyyy better position April 2020 (yes, know cases still high, daily deaths fraction last year), city coming back live pretty quickly, I'm optimistic it. there's still difference valid knowledge needed whether issue happened 50/50 people 60 majority 60, 80. Hell, Ontario entering another lockdown! Whoohoo!! Nothing like shitty vaccine rollout let know place world. point one shows you‚Äôre still infectious even fully vaccinated

Our understanding respiratory infections work tell infectious even fully vaccinated.

If enough virus inside body trigger significant immune response (aka symptoms), you‚Äôre shedding contagious virus. There‚Äôs way enough virus body trigger kind immune response shedding virus. fun! Well, grandpa didn‚Äôt survive COVID, survived flu, thanks asking. Well, grandpa didn‚Äôt survive COVID, survived flu, thanks asking. like see. well way this. 6-8 weeks rate covered basically adults want vaccine. waiting 40-60 days prevent thousands deaths severe disease, see they‚Äôre cautious. don‚Äôt know. Considering effective trustworthy public messaging huge part public health, hope so. Number going go countries start offering vaccines young people. Honestly, time hit general availability, policies likely go wayside. Even federal govt pushing states drop (which are), point within next couple months supply issue longer states residency restrictions, like anything else.

If commenter's son, I'd probably stay NH. Odds he'll able get vax June latest NH. vaccines amazing, set. Averaging 2.99M/ day past week.

Dammit, stuck thousand people get nice round 3M? Haven‚Äôt studies shown you‚Äôre 80% way full immunity week first shot?

I thought 2-3 weeks first shot? least impression. yeah ugh there's always going new variant. ""journalists"" using keep every doom mindset vaccines underway hard wear cloth mask protect people. continue protecting unvaccinated people everyone chance get one. difference taking small risk taking risk huge difference considering economy still shit due lockdown. agree shouldn‚Äôt put masks yet though. always choose patronize business require vaccine passport. Funny works. semantics. purely scientific perspective correct. policy perspective, CDC Director correct.

It's matter whether want speak absolutes general rules. policy use general rule, that's CDC says vaccinated people exposed virus need quarantine. Unfortunately, know long lasts. Idk man, there's ton anti vax put can't vaxxed petty decent risk. anti AstraZeneca push Europe strange makes wonder anything behind it.

Women likely get blood clots birth control people panicking.... part Ohio? can't speak elsewhere Cincinnati area pretty easy get one want it. Try CVS, put zip it'll tell appointments available within 20 miles. family friend week found two places full day open appointments 15miles away 7 day average 2.99 million. almost there! also know significantly less likely vaccinated people spread virus (because significantly less likely even contract first place) therefore act like it. Non watermarked CDC cardstock available free. idiots ones paying this. 

Note: I've 2 shots real card, looks tbh fake. like real proof anything. Mexican agree statement, denial seems norm extreme leftists right wing parties America. understand economies Mexico Brazil hold hard lockdowns long European Nations least kind economic assistance (maybe minimal least something) us nothing all, main problem half population contribute Taxes. cannot give assistance money (or stolen anyways...) finish first wave? disparity depending employer/job USA ridiculous. last job effectively sick time. current job (WITH UNION) 3 years 200 sick hours banked. hope Butanvac effective 1 shot, would massively help us right now, uses production process flu vaccine thing massively exported poorer nations  odds survival compared random year would barely taken dent. mean compare two, going stay home winter next flu outbreak year? still impose risk them. fine, that's point vaccines. flu

Has ever mass PCR testing, contact tracing, widespread masking, big vaccination campaign, flu? 

I think stop comparing two diseases. Covid much contagious efforts disproportionately bigger Masks don‚Äôt work dumb fence post, people hoard shit. tried get surgical masks February ‚Äò20 flu hit part family spared others try keep way, shit hit fan here, already gone. went like ten different stores. far dishonesty current messaging, I‚Äôd respectfully disagree that. needed data making proclamations, data‚Äôs coming in, it‚Äôs reacted changes messaging restrictions. acted seemed likely given knew vaccines viruses wrong, would disaster terms public health public trust. proof that, see ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù. we‚Äôd said ‚Äúhell yeah, go visit nana take dinner‚Äù turn real world nana 30% protected old people didn‚Äôt respond robustly vaccine people could still shed live virus vaccinated despite showing symptoms, we‚Äôd balls deep PR problems dead Ethels. Incorrect, stick swab anus. yes, mean throw rest caution wind. that's I'm saying CDC said hang non vaccinated low risk person? hard wear cloth mask protect people Idk PR team CDC feeding her

Is PR team CDC? know that‚Äôs public wants, feels like it‚Äôs job. Nah, Ill take one doesnt expose similar risk healthy 31 year old would get serious outcome covid.

Remember chances ending icu cause covid vs chances getting blood clot. chances of:

a) exposed covid first place

b) get alternative vaccine

c) ending icu

So yeah, thanks said particular. Didn‚Äôt say let guard anywhere I‚Äôve vaxed 6 months I‚Äôm good dude wrote entire article take dude? Seems pretty petty. got published semi-prestigious, upper-middle-brow magazine. Cuz getting fucked government, add get Prime Minister keeps lying LMAO great plan states follow vulnerable folks get shots, universities would make great mass vaccination sites (especially they're city centers) essential workers people follow lockdown rules.  Even China resorted following people around drones, but, could never fund everyone. donate brazil mexico consider somewhere like canada. global level utterly worst thing mankind, personal level like clear indication life üòÖ

Although honest access month would leave completely way get touch couple family members :( transforms everything

Unfortunately not, I'm still sitting 2 arms ,2 legs, tail &amp; definitely gills. 

Frankly, feel cheated. thing though, lots people 2 month lockdown.  longer.  asked make sacrifice did, even though anyone brain new national uniform mandatory lockdown impossible.  nobody surprised people would annoyed indifferent told sacrifice everyone else could live lives. Why? It‚Äôs opinion piece. read article. disagree least agree points (I don‚Äôt think ban abortions, prohibition bad) understand debate had. How's going canada? Europe?
Hello? I've first shot moderna second brain fog. kept forgetting words things looking directly took long time finish sentences haha county health department site used today get parents booked. 


Me partner also used ArmorVax I'm sure accessible us time options Springfield Cinci, could still worth checking case range wider. TL:DR school sports testing.

Buried article: ‚ÄúThe state allowed schools resume contact sports February 8, testing mandatory every sport. month later, tweaked policy mandate testing every sport regardless whether contact non-contact, change take effect Friday. Bagdasarian says like mitigation measures, change received pushback.‚Äù Warp speed good. lot criticize Trump on. LOT. vaccines win administration not. 

China's highest record 6.12 million doses/day (26th March 2021)

Source: Sometimes wear mask outdoors I‚Äôm going B, places require mask don‚Äôt feel like putting twice. They're cutting line, means people standing line, i.e., me, wait longer get chance get vaccinated, i.e., wait longer eligibility open up. Also, makes legit eligible people harder time getting shot (during early stages). 

Their incentive get vaccine altruistic (i.e., stop spread). protect ass get back normal lives quicker. Purely selfish reasons. We‚Äôve able work home office since June. choice. go sometimes usually hours. don‚Äôt miss rush hour ! say lot things get missed get dragged bc remote work (problems could solved spot person end multiple emails days). Americans fucking idiots!  bad thing people though?

I think there's right answer this. Yes, good get shots many arms possible. However, would also best get shots people eligible first, eh? someone eligible they're turned vaccine someone lied online form jumped line, would make feel really shitty. ""developed"" country vaccines. 
Canada. 
Europe. 

Funny free healthcare gang shitter. Norway small maybe overall fewer coronavirus cases per 1 million inhabitants US? 

Germany 30th March 207 deaths among people aged 39 younger hit quite hard Covid. 79 victims female 128 male. 

So considering really low death rate young women Covid, time quite high probability get blood clots AstraZeneca, think get anymore. better give vaccines. 

For older people though, especially men, get often blood clots AstraZeneca far likely die Covid, AstraZeneca might still worth it. Thank President Biden! You‚Äôre right. recognized immediately! post-Trump world, clicks viewership (last heard), headlines like essential. know prevented severe illness. know prevented infection transmission takes data/testing time determine.

So correct response act like still spread it.

6 months far that's testing data have. simple. 

&amp;nbsp;

As ""post covid world""...uhmmm, they've talking since march. probably true. think anyone merit says ""post covid world"". We're gonna get vaccines. We're gonna reduce transmission, HOPEFULLY point virus mutate gets mostly snuffed out. expect continue mutating different variants evading vaccines. wait fall? Ohio vaccine, think do, send Universities make easy fun students get vaccinated. lot students otherwise (I student). P1 found county away Michigan. We‚Äôre screwed here. Nobody taking shit seriously.  Sure. initial tech &amp; patents were, current vaccines developed produced world. either address issue attack me.

Your first paragraph attacking me, return favor.

Your second paragraph show know COVID vaccines approved FDA. Georgia sent way many doses rural southern counties. Vaccine appointments Atlanta still solidly booked. Vaccinespotter.org vaccinefinder.org pretty good finding available doses pharmacies many states.   
You enter ZIP radius miles you‚Äôre willing drive. (No personal info).  
It redirect pharmacy web site choose one. 4.7 million one day actually 1 1/2 days reporting due time CDC reported day. yes, highest daily anywhere world. like

The CDC admitted vaccines 90% effective completely blocking transmission safe given country hits 60%-70% mark masks totally dropped 

But people still want cling unto ""no, mask distance like prison line forever!"" Don‚Äôt forget Novavax too! Definitely! Exciting times early anti-body indicators recovered people suggested years least. They're formalizing study. Congrats! Feels like weight lifted shoulders. I've got mixed bag emotions right now! wonder Moderna say What‚Äôs point here? You‚Äôre clearly obsessed this. trying convey? Yup true, get PTO job accrue sick days... that‚Äôs freelance guess :/ It‚Äôs criminal country much people lower levels blatantly exploited. unions tough form feel like uphill battle singular perspective. USA we‚Äôre told grateful little upper mgmt gets reap everyone sowed. It‚Äôs inhumane. love working home probably heard start vaccine roll out, lot bad speculation reported news. Plus damn anti maskers breeding ground new mutant strains send us lockdown again.  That's like Ohio.

We know date restrictions come end, know exact criteria. cases fall 50 cases per 100k population two-week span, restrictions lifted. know date? No. But, know target goal need reach. said need specific brand. Pretty sure we've already ordered enough 2 doses everyone already manufactures. first report arround EMA's press conference investigation COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca thromboembolic events. Virtue signaling perfect description it! don‚Äôt really get either. fear mongering freak lot people it‚Äôs going security people awhile bet.

Also mentioned stocks exactly one sentence. dont got time dumb. Conversation done. whole point post clearly bidens export ban Hospitalizations still trending down. no, try again. I‚Äôm honestly fine Fed vague like right things open up. People already getting lax weeks getting shots. moment Biden like we‚Äôre good, people gona lose shit. Yeah okay? theft pharmaceutical companies raise price insulin $22 vial 1999 $300+ 2019? 

The fact focus stocks rather suffering hundreds millions tells need know you. What's significance 69.42%  Thanks saying this. agree 100%. Lots people dying. Lots getting it. Testing lots states skewing numbers. I‚Äôm afraid 4th wave clearly upon us unwillingness relatively large portions population get vaccine keep us while.  petty? 5 cases blood clots remarkable least. Lol bro need recalibrate. isn‚Äôt gonna six months. 

We‚Äôre still initial pandemic stages. Frankly, covid part world now, it‚Äôs going away prepare that. Expect measures masking distancing continue 2-3 years LEAST. expected many hospitals across country sedatives essential intubation within two weeks. 

What happens can't intubate anywone reason? need intubated placed ventilator common general anesthesia, means surgeries require type care... happens can't provide anyone? Sadly worst Hungary right even close. got first last weekend bought toaster. feel lame. Lol. Pfizer didn‚Äôt even study transmission UK data reflect Pfizer clinical trials never happened?

What? Correct. 50+ opened today, it‚Äôs everyone yet. 16+ April 15th. T-cell immunisation nothing. Similar story. supervisor announced Zoom staff meeting today everyone expected back office normal work schedule mid-June. Lol vision saves one theft. said month ago got downvoted. We're going tip supply/demand curve next 6 weeks. Let rest world take AZ supply. Moderna Pfizer help Johnson Johnson got us ""covered"" (Literally). Wow. got hammered facts. You‚Äôre 100% right. Take meager upvote.  It‚Äôs 91% effective contracting it, chance would contract 100% circumstance, especially taking preventive measures. 

Say exposed 20% chance contacting it. vaccine cuts chance 90% more, bringing actual risk like one fifth one percent.

Still million times better getting covid I‚Äôm glad lucky enough get Yeah I‚Äôll get absolutely signing yearly subscription. doubt people moved Spanish flu middle 1919. probably happen year later. vaccinations it'll much faster time around, can't blame people planning bad scenario. yeah like mRNA vaccines 90%+ effective. that's insane vaccine world. point everyone wants (and eligible vaccine) going going move on.

Is chance variants/strains/etc... effing up? yes, far vaccine proving match good data adjusted needed.

I'm hoping enough people willing get vaccine reach herd immunity medically cannot. really group effort point. u/adotmatrix confidently stupid? Got second shot Moderna yesterday! again:

That's works. Asian countries people wear mask variety reasons like high pollution levels feel sick think polite keep spreading sickness go 

They randomly wear masks normal clothing everyday like sub seems think drink tears, turtle, drink 1 case 600,000 doses seem statistically significant enough stop rollout opinion. Vast majority data points vaccine effective safe 99% cases. 

Sounds like brainier arms. fact get exclude outliers like that. get science cases get here, especially Michigan one populated states. Michigan makes significant portion American population factors state country covid. can't exclude like that.

By logic pick choose states decreasing case rates make seem even worse is. take Georgia equation say ""hey exclude Georgia next wave looking pretty awful"". good statistical reasoning see kind thing time. Hopefully suck deez nuts 6 months  saying go really opposite, hundreds articles published, enough data start promoting use specially prior infection early treatment, case moderate severe cases disease reavels less effective effect recommendations made sense based data time. Taken together, they're sort over-reactions incomplete data. 

At first want give AZ older people less effective highest-risk. Later data came showing huge efficacy hospitalization, straight reversed get elderly vaccinated ASAP. there's actual data showing minimal danger (at least one order magnitude less dangerous COVID) younger people receiving it, places stopping that.

In context, think new recommendation actually best bunch: finished trials mixing doses (there ongoing ones may data them), optimizes use two vaccines. way one mRNA dose infection jacks antibodies tremendously, one mRNA booster weaker vaccine probably extremely effective.

What find weird AZ first dose that's caused clotting events young people, avoiding risk way.  Someone tell Cuomo quick think that's kind point he's making.

Oh yeah hypocrites exist parties criticize party wrong things. think people ""skipping line"" btw. also can't say buy notion people mainly selfish reasons. would need given empirical data suggests this. can't rule large percentage people might eager protect friends family.

The assertion guys made people getting shots selfish reasons, guys resort intuition defend statement opposed evidence. 

But there's also question whether motive even relevant all, given fact vaccinated, benefits us all. viruses tend behave. mutates spread easily, become less lethal process. problem comes there's perfect balance, like smallpox. Europeans angry lost end, again.

But Brazil. Hospital city even closed emergency room. can't even go anymore, attending anyone. 

My aunt's friend got COVID spent days trying find place hospitalized. possible 100% beds occupied 98% ICU occupied. 

What happens lot, too, is:
A friend family living Curitiba, hospitalized intubated. improved, released him.
Now got worse intubated again.

They waiting people recover still lack beds. 
There's lack oxygen. Health Minister said week doctors use less oxygen people, like lol  

There's also lack meds intubate people. says, there's intubate meds 3 days...  many people get flu shot becomes annual thing? It‚Äôll start mutate potentially worse maybe even lighter versions don‚Äôt know course mutation take.  Yea. Outperforms pandemic creation. Turn attention countries tried scam pharma's, invest research supply infrastructure steal countries vaccines. 

Like Europe. got first shot gave packet information explaining emergency authorized authorization meant. people understand EUA they're paying attention. bet think pretty smart knowing that!üôÇ  vax companies say vaccinations STOP infections.
Why would make sense vaccinate healthy people then? another one 6 mths always excuse China outperforms US vaccine companies said last around 6 months.

Stop stealing countries vaccines like stole Australias. exactly first shot Pfizer. got texts asking know explain anyone. told feel like discomfort knees feels like joints. different anything. said hey that's absolutely take it.

It‚Äôs hard explain, like pressure behind eyes ears almost. turned pretty nasty headache pretty quickly, took Tylenol. helped within 20 minutes felt well enough go sleep. felt perfect next morning. all, felt poorly three hours. expecting much worse!

My boyfriend got Moderna side effects first one, besides sore arm, extremely mild symptoms second. pretty instantly metallic taste mouth (weird, right?) lasted rest day. tired next day felt vaguely weather, said hard pinpoint, felt ‚Äúoff‚Äù, small headache day. Tylenol helped immensely didn‚Äôt even miss work. vaccine worse virus people... know shif ton people got covid never symptoms... Private companies, EU. Yes. It‚Äôs long accepted hyper sanitized environments, excessive hand sanitizer, generally never coming contact viruses bacteria actually bad kids immune systems.

J&amp;j still testing 2 shot Janssen owned J&amp;J, American company. BioNTech based work mRNA research University Pennsylvania, among others. saying one million artificial number Norway. get shots, 95% positive vaccinated, az. be. shots given fine, shots given previously. manufacturing mishap mentioned article caught vaccine sent even put bottles. Even thread got people saying reason EU behind vaccinations US ""export ban"". 

That mean I'm putting blame US. like hey AZ failing deliver 71 million doses maybe allowed export vaccines fulfill contracts like US doing. obviously read neighbours burned masks??? idiots. significant decrease infections anyone ‚Äúgo back normal‚Äù. Personally don‚Äôt think ‚Äúnormal‚Äù happening anytime soon. ""You're witness pro-governor move"" Australian Open outbreaks. purchased AstraZeneca supplies little suffer delays. Life quality superpowah stuff ;-) mRNA technology american. 
Sorry. mad. 7 day average per capita vaccine distribution countries million people, Canada currently 3rd behind US UK. Still fast enough it‚Äôs okay. America ended pandemic? no. need calm down. seen anyone say yet, armorvax app pretty good finding appointments mass vaccination sites. I've seen lots available app Cincinnati. got appointment Kroger website best way I've found course, anything causing delays week unlikely point saw argument another thread someone told person thought vaccine passports bad, would one people train auschwitz looking forward job housing. Nice.. real grown hours that's great news.

Yes is! Literally ship. 
I mean. EU genocides stealing vaccines. 

Wish guys would get thanos snap.

 We'd probably mars europe holding rest us back. Ireland clearly reason US politicians.

lol pathetic deflection. literally took australias vaccines ship italy kept them.

Ahahaha ship. 

My god beyond help. Read actual news. understand need solidarity isn‚Äôt Bulgaria country vaccination open everyone uptake low? Maybe saying ""nobody"" blaming US simply incorrect. Even thread got people saying reason EU behind vaccinations US ""export ban"". Eu export. Private companies export. Eu taxes No. 

EU literally took australias vaccines ship italy kept them. 

Iike actual pirates. 

Physically picked vaccines said ""to: Australia from: AZ""

Literal theft, like pirates. 

I can't wait US help everyone else except EU canada.

The EU travel bans canada's border wall convenient us. 30 cases 18.1million doses link... I'm European. Nobody blaming US UK matter. understanding 0 fast tracking safety competent trials. top that, issues beyond incredibly rare anaphylaxis observed given broad adoption. That's thing understand EUropeans though. keep complaining US issues AstraZeneca, joint Swedish-British firm.

So EU problems AZ, US somehow blame?  friends. stealing vaccines. 

The ones stealing vaccine UK US dipshit. FDA fast-tracking worry everyone. Either fully capable vetting things incredibly quickly simply choose drag feet, they're cutting corners injectable chemistry.

Neither positive. export ban 

Of course do. I'm criticizing export ban though. buts mean anything. 

I absolutely agree. also completely irrelevant point I'm making. EU try cheap haggle euros might secured better contracts Pfizer Moderna. 

The EU ""haggled"" put Pfizer Moderna vaccines initially ordered. Last checked make 83% administered vaccines.  


The issue Astrazeneca supposed deliver 100 million doses Q1 delivered 31 million far. ordered way actually needed, issue supposed main supplier Q1 produced said would.

Thankfully Q1 issue companies like Pfizer J&amp;J able make AZ's shortcomings Q2. people college students superspreaders? I'm US, University fully online past semesters. development work could home lucky position see anyone part. I'd like get vaccine soon, makes sense first vaccinate literally everyone work close contact people. yea hbu Sars, bird flu, swine flu covid started china. 

China makes pandemic every 5 years. 

America ended pandemic

Stay mad tho. No, Ireland report recovered numbers estimation active number cases going incorrect. closest probably number people hospital (under 300 country 5 million). Got second Pfizer today introduced 5 year old NYC. loved buildings people. Knowing terribly city effected virus made bittersweet. feels different now. Lol really. 1918 flu pandemic started US. One stranger variants developed. I'm healthy amount skepticism there's need aggressively idiotic. US helped Canada Mexico 4 million doses helped entire world funding research development tune $18 billion dollars. peace mind fucking worth it. 

Gonna agree 100%!! lol. That's like medieval feudalism thinking. mean know eu primative wow. 

Eu signed worse contracts later mad. 

Australia earlier. Eu one last. 

It's like. guy front line buys last coffee take pass you, back line. he's foreigner not. 

At least australia factory vaccine production. helping EU. bad deal 250k vaccines. 

Eu running friends. stealing vaccines. 

So glad need rely eu vaccines. guys would definitely steal those. Imagine spent money building factories EU acts like pirates takes vaccines. credit ""Europe"" vaccine development? 

""Past inventions"" 

One people working BioNTech now, Katalin Kariko, literally one people funded US University Pennsylvania research mRNA. We're talking Galileo bud. Thats certain states refusing work federal government's initiatives... Remember Arizona literally publically refused vaccines ""uhm need guvment handouts!!!"". Considering annually approx 15k people die UK flu and, currently, admittedly help lockdown death rate 40 day UK 15k year... That's true. 

We've got vaccine single digit deaths per day within week two. opening society, vaccines take slack mean deaths worse, less annual flu death levels. Biden took over, 100 million doses first 100 days seemed optimistic. 

You're right said straight BS. goal always conservative hell. already million day Biden took office, clearly getting started. know AZ shots help Canadians unless lower age restriction. 2 weeks expect 55+ able sign appointments phizer moderna vaccines. doubt US make decision give vaccines soon enough matter us. Thought provoking question would sooner put house arrest reap rewards less bare minimum back handwashing again? mean, got competent admin roll vaccines efficiently erase let 400k+ people die reason political grandstanding. feel anxious wearing it. feel anxious wearing it. know the, ""Oh God, need real air freedom."" walk places... Definitely Miami lol German covid response. There's thinking it. EU paid vaccines. right EU take whatever produced turf according contractual demand targets. AZ fails deliver EU right take paid for. 

Australia needs chill fuck later EU sign contracts. happened? Sounds bad. really like dust lungs.  burn everyone AR-15's much less effort? 

/s we? UK absolutely trialing domestic 'covid passports'. *declared* Funny - played Plague Inc. per capita basis, Germany alone spent twice US spent vaccine development. 

False. bullshit German/EU trolls similar say gErMaNy fUndEd bIoNTeCh actually Pfizer funded 100% costs developing Pfizer-BioNTech. like refused read article even title. USA weeeeird. back said bottleneck production actually bottling vaccine itself. much difference going make? clue increase would huge That's great part technology, rapidly update new shots too!

But vaccines available, know receive another one. AZ vaccine available country reasoning might different.

It‚Äôs simple thing, wear mask, yet people react you‚Äôre asking gear chainmail. Psychologists study stuff, know there's dictionary emotional scores assigned words can't life remember enough find it. 

It's probably general experience. someone's searching word describe bad outcome they'll use 'consequence', strong negative emotional connotation it. negative outcome they'll use another word like 'outcome', means people expect 'outcomes' negative i.e. neutral positive thus 'outcome' slightly positive connotation.

Obviously, data may alter conclusion; but, barring conspiracy trying prove 'prove pretty much anything', claims new variant make much worse original. 

Where countervailing reports showing ""massive about-turn""? live world contracts made adhered to. UK anything different anybother country would capability. EU countries try good citizen ensure countries got fair share. slow incompetent contracts.

But it's.jusg boarders made contracts written on. Contract law underpins world live in.

We need to.change world view. convenient. fortunately still scientists actually follow science go dig issues. 

Science made skeptical people different denialism. related:

**Lawmakers: Require nursing homes disclose vaccine homes publicly disclose vaccination rates flu pneumonia there‚Äôs similar mandate COVID-19 shots, even though steepest toll virus among residents long-term care lawmakers parties urging Biden administration require disclosure coronavirus vaccination rates residents staff, make easy family members, advocacy groups researchers access potentially critical details. Everybody liked this! vaccinations really gotten far making difference hospitalisations outbreaks nursing homes basically ceased. I'd say travel restrictions eventually travel freely vaccinated, quarantine otherwise. Everyone vaccinated July, August probably different. Im surprised trouble finding dentist, dentist reopened last summer really trouble getting regulars back in, lot people skipping regular cleanings South Africa subject stringent restrictions U.K.?

You‚Äôre likely allow someone unknown variant SA U.K. basically two countries persistently continue sequence genome samples throughout pandemic. Nobody would know anything variants concern otherwise. Europe US likely crawling undetected mutations.

To make things worse, never invaded started wars  dont think people would want take az us since fizer moda Sadly, I'm pretty sure vast majority money made TV contracts. can't claim '1000 deaths per 100 million' useful data, what's discussed rare type blood clot appears among younger people likely caused AZ vaccine. repeat repeat, also opinion health worker ICU (in abcnews article) : main thing done repeatedly expose people images people dying ICUs.

People rationale, mostly emotional. would accept lockdowns far easier (and Macron would taken strategy ""no lockdown"") news people ill health workers exhausted abstract. UK, doctors used pandemic excuse effectively shut mental health services abandon anyone complicated. services shut doors stopped offering real care. They've useless phone calls. I'm deaf phone calls good me. Therefore they've sending fucking worksheets saying I'm accessing care.

Now, go barely remember mask like fear bringing virus home. months gone constant fear relative normality. 34 year old woman got vaccines February. Ummm no, please quote said that... Dakotas people died like 2 month time span.

But like downplaying pandemic

Those facts don‚Äôt matter

Only marketing matters Grift. supply testing probably constraint though; there's less spread cohorts getting less likely present symptoms (and therefore seek testing) obviously amount tests conducted less people seeking testing, relatively time consuming intrusive (where am, I'd really go way tested). It‚Äôs idea. one brought up. young people risk must continue stay home protect vulnerable.  It‚Äôs attainable human interaction. Nuance understated. CDC White House serve different roles. CDC provides policy recommendations White House executes law puts policy practice. business hires consultant says invest least $18,000 xyz decide worth invest $20,000 instead, I'm people come woodwork claiming I'm wasting money I'm trusting experts. silly. exposure, symptoms (they extremely mild ones gone). booked rapid test peace mind tho. Since masks political restriction, lots politicians tell take mask immediately. fact, places, already told people take mask getting vaccinated. 

These political restrictions. CDC authority restrict anything. That‚Äôs point. states want higher vaccination rates, say mask restrictions you‚Äôre vaccinated. 

They quite free many already. remaining ones soon. even come idea? get together without mask good time.

So counting people actually exposed virus part way overcome it? first shot, messaging vaccine generally says makes safer, makes immune anything sort. want get even I'm fairly sure die, unless really need get virus simply able avoid forever. quick look shows /u/endlessbull Spain. know expat situation, looks like Spain still 70-79.

/u/endlessbull, [which group currently fall Agreed first shot. first. Going MA's 30-day vaccination average, [MA see 70% vaccinated July Since that's lower bound estimate herd immunity, expect things ""basically normal"" July 4th.

This estimate account 2% growth rate know long could sustained for. also account anti-vaxxers sources percentage population anti-vaxx hesitant due speed development perceived lack testing. Unlike masking virus measures, vaccines politically polarized far. think vaccine passport conversation dangerous one, entangles vaccination politics. vaccination passports potential change that. attempt make vaccination compulsory day day domestic activities, certain 49% country going impressed.

The system working. People want shots. Let's keep pushing education incentives reach irreducible minimum number people absolutely refuse bee vaccinated. outbreaks still going concern then, look strategies like time.

However, weighed known threat posed coronavirus.

If 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus around 50,000 would die. 40-year-olds around 2,500 would die.

This balance risk benefit continue assessed safety data comes vaccine programme moves younger people, lower risk dying Covid-19"". escape western society.

This escalating fast. I'm assuming solid data back 'younger people dying' claim. I'll wait... Florida makes 6.5% US population. Thank reinforcing point. No, state government tell wear mask. state still mask mandate up. still wear mask. Seven people died unusual blood clots getting Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine UK, medicines regulator confirmed BBC.

In total, 30 people 18 million vaccinated 24 March clots.

It still clear coincidence genuine side effect vaccine.

The Medicines Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says benefits continue outweigh risk.

However, concern led countries including Germany, France, Netherlands Canada restrict vaccine's use older people.

The¬†data released MHRA Friday¬†showed 22 cases cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) type blood clot brain.

These accompanied low levels platelets, help form blood clots, body. MHRA also found clotting problems alongside low platelet levels eight people.

Now MHRA confirmed, email BBC, ""sadly seven died"".

Dr June Raine, chief executive MHRA, said: ""The benefits‚Ä¶ preventing Covid-19 infection complications continue outweigh risks public continue get vaccine invited so.""

Investigations way determine AstraZeneca vaccine causing rare blood clots. Earlier week European Medicines Agency said ""not proven, possible"".

Two issues raising suspicions. first unusual nature clots which, including low levels platelets rare antibodies blood linked clotting disorders.

""This raises possibility vaccine could causal factor rare unusual cases CVST, though know yet, research urgently needed,"" said Prof David Werring, UCL Institute Neurology.

The issue difference Oxford-AstraZeneca Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines.

There two cases CVSTs Pfizer UK, 10 million vaccinated, low platelet levels.

However, remains uncertainty around common clots normally are. Estimates range two cases per million people every year nearly 16 every million normal times coronavirus linked abnormal clotting, may making clots common.

Germany reported 31 CVSTs nine deaths 2.7 million people vaccinated there, cases young middle-aged women.

Similar data affected UK published UK, wider mix people thought affected.  breakthrough covid cases (where person fully vaccinated) still result long haul symptoms? reduced severity breakthrough cases result long term fatigue brain fog see long haul COVID cases? so, what? compare education level appropriate mask wearing social distancing.

Sorry, I'm taking word it. A. immunity something, next occurrence something *less* symptomatic more.. 

you experience symptoms disease. experience symptoms immune system. vaccines extreme special cases, designed elicit strong immune responses. 1) packaged adjuvants, basically molecules aggravate immune system reacting, 2) they're potent cocktail. vaccines carry LOT ""virus"" them. simplicity, imagine infectious dose covid-19 like 100 viral particles. comparison, mRNA vaccines packaging tens millions mRNA blueprints spike protein (in reality, true numbers logarithmic this, example purposes...). course body really thinks attack. sensing strong presence something foreign seemingly appeared overnight. immune response spike protein second mRNA vaccine going much, much significant come contact covid-19, magnitude viral epitopes body sensing multiples B. symptomatic, good sign: might going kind immune-system overreaction. BAD thing (hint: immune system overreaction one ways Covid19 kills, lookup ""cytokine storms"") 

this works. cytokine storm overreaction immune system per se, immune system damaging body, turn elicits stronger immune response, cycle continues. cyclical effect runaway immune system, definitively case vaccine. similar all, honest C. finally, 2nd time worse first, 3rd? 

this skipped lot simple much immunological background, 3rd unlikely much worse 2nd. body innate immune response, adaptive immune response. 1st vaccine, innate immune response reacts initially. adaptive immune response primed (after 1st vaccine), first scene 2nd shot. It‚Äôs turned people creating weird strawmen lamenting said strawmen. perspective thread, would think there‚Äôs gigantic movement people want pandemic last forever force everyone wear masks end time. necessarily.

How else painlessly pivot towards vaccinating clear risk keep deaths low possible without every interest group mother saying unfair deflecting political outrage regarding slow vaccine rollout? seizing bloodclots excuse. addition, boosts BioNtech vaccine truly comes Europe governments negative contrast Az greater voluntary uptake. 

That, purely political CYA maneuver. Though something tells EU member states access doses UK happening. Stop defensive. clarifying incase mistakenly believed EU exported vaccines distributed among member states. said safe travel, there's virtually risk serious infection. That's opposite discouragement.

Gor me, cry ""we know"" never sounded right.

Yes, novel virus, large part actual science classification. know virus, pretty safe hypothesis would behave similarly viruses.

But no. ""We dont know"", likely driven fear, took wasted time resources acting like knew literally nothing. 

Personally, blame years overly litigious society fear getting wrong, going tout science really need trust process throw basic tenants fear/politics/caution. 2019 zero COVID-19 cases humans. virus still existed circulating animals. Even eradicated COVID humans (which won't), mean COVID longer exists. Nice. I'll feeling pretty good parents vaccinated myself. give robust numbers lower count experiments, environmental conditions controlled.

So, depending wether lab experiment measures correlation real-world protection, could much better real-world data.

The first studies' results titers vs. symptomatic severe illness look promising. likely, possible predict vaccine effectiveness small-scale lab tests. That‚Äôs cause DeWine conservative technocrat. Honestly I'm suprised already law Social media mistake. must destroy return monke.

Social distancing, mask requirements, sanitation theater needs come end eventually. 

For example, restaurants need bring back fucking condiment bottles napkin dispensers tables. wipe every 6 months, would welcome change. Paper disposable menus also nice too. Meanwhile plastic barriers booths/tables go.

One things I'm incredibly disappointed happened yet America mandated paid sick time. want people spread virus, make choose making money spreading disease. seems like every opportunity benefit workers gets passed leaders, even ones claim care people, beholden corporate interests. It‚Äôs 90 percent effective preventing infection. Quite well, comparatively rest Europe. CDC Director comment interview, official CDC policy update. testing sports starts today... wouldn‚Äôt explain uptick yet. read title? I'm speculating, based that, reply...

#TO PERSON SPECULATING

Strong mod work, though. were. Source: John M. Barry's 'The Great Influenza', excellent read totally burned pandemics (and gee would anybody be...). Yeah 2nd shot definitely something. achy tired. fever symptoms luckily. basically sat around day. Still able work mood anything physical. I've suspecting awhile really hope right! started Pfizer AZ though, believe EU. I'm saying reason countries ahead vaccine supply. spread misinformation. I'm questioning sources data. data analysis simple getting data comparing two sets. many variables considered peer review vital. Correlation causation.

The turn I'm referring analysis data indicating increased mortality British variant showed two data sets come completely different times year. virus winter higher IFR summer environmental reasons That's one way random(-ish) mass testing, guess... spread misinformation. source data expected fatality rate 2 week period year old population ? Actual Covid far given year immunity, I've exposed multiple times work elsewhere. Multiple times others catching it, me. Multiple times others testing positive, me. tells immune system working intended. exposure sterilzed immune system, exposure re-primes immune system. 

So expect vaccine jabs go much further. Likewise overwhelming majority population. 

Once critical mass reached vaccination, virus like original SARS. It'll there, nobody even realize it. even care. part true? really argue points. Maybe we'll get Covid vaccine every year? can't figure disagreeing with.  Best tactic vaccinate who'd get sick worst. Vaccinated people still get infection carry (although less likely) get seriously sick. 
Hence vaccunating incoming travellers well protect local vulnerables unless also vaccinated. could happen. Another variant could come pretend current round vaccines really thing. 

I mean E484K variants able affect Plasma treatment used 3rd world countries since beginning. vaccines seem limited success them. new Kent variant. 19 new Indian variants look for, plus one considered serious. 

I looking number countries stats good thing although cases world ramping up, number deaths seem hit plateau countries, going down. Good news last front. FFS. Tell daughter lie. check ID. know. Fuck anyone thinks wrong. Protect family. sign cvs go. anyone else seen videos nurses faking giving shots brazil ? lol CVS rollout amazing. online system smooth painless, million times better state system. 

I booked three different appointments yesterday friends getting shots today Monday. infinitely easier alternative here. Damn US vaccination drive seems mark. India anyone age 45 (currently) vaccinate govt designated vaccination center country option acquiring privately company work for. download app, book date, time, venue show there, show booking get vaccinated. opt walk vaccination places wait queue. 

In quite centers even people 45 getting vaccinated (only walk in) doses bound get wasted end day due low turn 45 people. know quite friends 20s 30s got vaccinated smoothly fast. There's nonsense home state all, carry valid ID documentation purposes. Evidence based thinking That's great news Gurl totally fine. got mine little sleepy, took exam 10 p.m. issue got shot 930 a.m.

The day mild headache sore arm it. one hundred percent recommend drinking ton water going bed early day get shot vaccines prevent infected mutated strain. PCR tests make sure bringing mutations unaffected countries. lot reddit older children hate children (""child free"") time reminded might inconvenienced someone's child lash like children. happening subreddit largely want hear anything around trying protect kids 16 can't get vaccine yet might possibly inconvenience them. Pay fake card risk getting COVID get vaccination free drastically reduce chance COVID.

People fucking stupid.  Anyone else seeing slight uptick cases last days? worried. subside days vaccinations happen? Great news! Fingers crossed x yet health experts disagree ""common sense."" They're experts field result many years school, training experience. qualifications arena viruses effectively combat them? reading vaccine app yesterday apparently one way prove it; still use card doctor's note etc. think simply putting 50% liquid vials. dose still same. U.S. military every police department America combined resources keep every human house, house homeless, deliver food water supplies, deal inevitable riots efforts.  U.S. large rural country.  still would delayed COVID's spread. Uruguayan here. Uruguay family, friends there. really boat there, buddy. Take care stay safe !!! Wishful thinking. Or, hear out, want play safe couple months vaccines safe. trust health experts know they're talking about, sure. may disregard advice peril, I've decided know them. [Hey heads used trigger word.

Yeah, things safe, good covid protocols. - someone CDC, probably

Like, hear people make these\^ kinds arguments, honestly makes think people expect us Covid protocols indefinitely, even though vaccines, even though hospitals overwhelmed. 

It's exhausting. China Vietnam don‚Äôt need health qualifications make claim. It‚Äôs common sense. don‚Äôt need kids vaccinated order return normal. Kids almost completely immune covid spending another year quarantine waiting vaccinate would waste time. chilean study released information saying 90% people trial developed antibodies 6 weeks first dose. claim made health experts disagree OP said. really need qualifications relay information. 

If said ""You're wrong say are,"" I'd need provide qualifications. Meaning hope adamant messaging following health experts advice everything else much covid. makes think need vaccine every year? Free healthcare also funded taxes wish thing! Health experts would disagree you, regardless think them. qualifications possess say authority know better do? Yes, see everywhere Europe citation. understanding export ban vaccines vaccine parts (as rna going europe pfizers vaccine). Could link ban? Obama worst far then. vaccinate single person covid entire 8 year term üôÑ countries don‚Äôt require vaccination let enter. yeah, mandatory vaccines public school fucked never happen. Hmm. honestly feels like groundhog day.

Why care cases people getting severely sick?

Because COVID!!!!!! realize NOVEL coronavirus death outcome? 

Rinse repeat. 
I mean, can't also say lack testing people experiencing symptoms grand scale? live campus. Trust statement. And?  health experts disagree you. qualifications make claim? also that. Compared flu shot got fall arm barely hurt injection site, noticeable elbow pain injection arm 2-3 days. export ban? understanding pretty much every country makes vaccine ban exports? numbers shown skewed depending strain COVID. bottom line getting many people vaccinated possible name game, J&amp;J vaccinate twice many people number shots. many people get vaccinated, difference ""effectiveness"" irrelevant. ""Health experts"" biggest asswipes entire pandemic. Children high risk serious disease COVID-19. There's reason live dystopian restricted society there's real risk public safety. covid February got vaccinated last week. got Moderna, wasn‚Äôt bad! got 5 pm Friday night. Felt arm pain almost immediately, random wave nausea later night caused throw up. went bed. next day, felt really tired day - like kind tired remember kids babies! symptom still went nature walk kids tidied house stuff. 10 pm Saturday night like fog lifted felt 100 percent better. never got fever, aches, chills (though never got symptoms covid either). ate sausage breakfast. Please lighting bolt God, forgot üôè would look stagger wife appointments, given toddler. Yes crossing fingers. least inside EU ramp massively now. Think germany expecting double doses per week compared going bad, going take years figure full impact. Even early pandemic NHS warning people this. early June last year, expecting tens thousands preventable cancer deaths. [published University College London cancer data hub Data-Can estimated death toll could high 18,000 England. [Institute Cancer said last month pandemic would ‚Äúa terrible indirect impact lives months come.  suspension much normal NHS care lockdown also meant 12,750 fewer cancer patients surgery, 6,000 fewer received chemotherapy 2,800 fewer undergone radiotherapy. Services put hold reduce risk people cancer, lower immunity, contracting coronavirus came hospital treatments.  speculate make it. won't. 

This thing gonna end itself. 

In 2022 think we'll even talk covid anymore Health professionals would disagree lot stuff personal lives clear, they've already announced they're allowing foreign spectators games. thousands foreigners they're referring article actual athletes, media, etc. South Korea chance. seen zero events advertised. festivals, carnivals, concerts, farmers markets. numbers increasing, messaging won‚Äôt change things won‚Äôt planned/scheduled. Really sucks. Tbh think testing big part too. lot states testing fraction MI, NY, NJ, makes sense increase cases. public mixing means vaccines less effective. Social distancing + vaccination almost fully effective, remove one cases pop up. next ""wave"" huge, likely, though less severe. decrease testing also hide new surge. vaccinated population, there's reason much different seasonal flu. Covid continue downward trajectory forever, outbreaks likely still occur. terrorist organization currently leads definitely voted them.... everyone getting vaccinated would make sense get vaccine passport continue pcr test people every time go international. Covid seems going endemic, vaccine passport would cost efficient solution. said AZ better Pfizer Moderna. vaccines awesome, going save lot lives Sure, also win lottery, mean quit job start planning buying yacht. different levels effectiveness why. Pfizer 95%+ (100% last test round 15-17 yr olds). J&amp;J like 70% so, seem eliminate serious illness infection. Stay safe!! Really worried guys.  used form social control. vaccinating 1% US population every day, incredible achievement. hard see another surge/wave could last long hit 40%, 50%, 60% inoculation next weeks. Man, state almost 1500 people hospital covid January, 350 icu. Today 182 hospital 59 icu. Vaccines work, can‚Äôt wait states start opening eligibility College kids probably worst spreaders past 8 months. smart decision. Although, many already virus might matter much would think. Yeah agree, although don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs going put past 4th July rate we‚Äôre going vaccines hard line every state going different degree. 

That said, think going hard keep restrictions hospitalizations deaths fall around flu. 

For US roughly 100-300 deaths per day. 

If 7 day average deaths fall level would expect restrictions would relatively quickly lifted. similar bad experience first. consider switching providers, night day us i'm really happy did. Thanks good source (FDA). Skimmed it, explains EUA means, explains testing required get EUA, explains data needed EUA, process manufacturers using gain EUA, plans monitor vaccines EUA.

Could please point explains steps yet completed gain FDA approval? question. state again.

Did paperwork explain vaccine approved? Serviettes win!

Stay safe friend! It‚Äôs math. science surrounding vaccines correct, simply huge increase. 

Increases take weeks build virus won‚Äôt weeks build vaccines. 

Going Israel, nationally, virus 2 weeks build r goes one. course, isn‚Äôt quite right waves happen locally area different vaccination rates. end next month, every American adult wants vaccine least first shot half shots. definitely need vigilant little longer, ""4th wave......impending doom.....I'm scared..."" stuff nonsense. heard NYT still transmit virus even vaccinated? Child-free adults might open wearing masks public till kids vaccinated won‚Äôt willing stay home/social distance every adult wants vaccine it, probably point July 4th Thanksgiving. require proof vaccination deadlier infectious diseases like smallpox, measles, etc. attend mass events?

Because declared Smallpox globally eradicated 1980, measles killed 207k people **globally** not, covid special, verify certain percentage population fully vaccinated open things up?

Because COVID killed 2.83 million people globally slightly 1 year. mean, seriously dude? COVID special maybe requires additional precautions like proving vaccinated certain large events? open percentage population vaccinated, many places that. many places also requiring additional precautions we're tail end global, massive pandemic and, promising there's still uncertainty things like variants, etc. 

It's crazy pandemic showed people complain EVERY precaution. Masks control, vaccine microchips, lockdowns communism, passports fuck freedoms, [Delicious. Finally accurate fucking must family college It‚Äôs fine took vaccine guess? anyone already covid get pfizer moderna? Curious side effects you, I've read first shot hit hard. 

My wife vax appointments Monday, covid January. infant 2 toddlers I'm worried us wrecked day (but thrilled getting vaccinated, obviously) allowed vote government, passports allowed trade world. they? Brazilian trial 100% efficacy avoiding death, important metric now.

The efficacy asymptomatic COVID 50%, kinda low, it‚Äôs vaccine due political kerfuffle. ~~Live free or~~ die. UK released data today seem link specific clotting we're worried (CVLT).

UK seen 20 occurrences vaccinated AZ 2 vaccinated Pfizer. data comes clearer link, need work rate occurance assess risk/benefit properly Moderna already Phase One version better handle B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2....Plus Moderna FDA approved changes Moderna‚Äôs vaccine allowing doses vial. actually heard someone say drinking water drops oregano essential oil would prevent covid. 

How people get deluded? I'm still trying figure end supposed be. baseline numbers hospitalizations/deaths/vaccinations need reach lift restrictions? We've year still seems consensus goals actually trying reach. Ohioan here.

He's ok. 

He's basically good politician. things like things dislike. Overall competence neutralizes incompetence want politician. Neutral buoyancy. one yesterday 91.3% number also mentioned ‚Äúat least 6 months protection‚Äù well COVID-19 general (mostly wild type B.1.117). within original confidence intervals came 95% ongoing analysis used tighter confidence intervals. B.1.351 study small sample size, though ‚Äú100% effective‚Äù small sample, CI‚Äôs lot wider, 95% 53% 100% effective. take away small sample size study showed it‚Äôs highly likely Pfizer‚Äôs effectiveness going significantly less ballpark range J&amp;J Novavax landed, possibility greater. topic I've thinking lately, friend mine SE Asia thinks getting vaccinated 2023 least.

The U.S. killing vaccinations one many reasons that's great puts us position export doses countries desperately need them, even thought places able cover cost administering flow vaccine doses Covax supplied far, face funding supply shortfalls, remains relatively manageable. Countries need can, theory, apply funding support distribution donors including World Bank United States.

Okay bad also worried limited resources would allocated. Many African countries ‚Äúshockingly low number health personnel per capita,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIf pull go vaccinations, rest health misunderstanding Covax vaccines going sent countries delivered people‚Äôs communities,‚Äù said Ayoade Alakija, co-chair African Union Africa vaccine delivery alliance. ‚ÄúCountries receiving airports, that‚Äôs Covax‚Äôs responsibility ends.‚Äù

So countries means request funding support distribution, awesome, also country handle responsibly solid plan place make distribution work smoothly. 

Another issue countries enough health personnel actually administer shots, leave post handle vaccines might anyone left take original post. get new variants concern coming pipeline, solution make new boosters mRNA technology. Trying vaccinate everyone entire world going take decades.

Biontech/Pfizer already upgraded 2 billion doses year. reason upgrade 3 4 billion next year. Since one shot needed booster, it'll take two three mRNA manufacturers produce enough entire world population. Others bound enter market. 7 UK looks like od 18mln doses someone who‚Äôs daydreaming concerts awhile now, hard disagree. I‚Äôll take get. There's zero point fact checking claims. Anyone believes first place swayed damning evidence.  Wow basically 80% 75+ taken it, that's great!! Hopefully age groups follow suit. Unvaccinated people acting like vaccinated. Plus, there's contagious variant(s). 

I'm overjoyed taking kids get first jabs tomorrow. I'll still helicopter relaxed elevation.  feel like people thread understand concept free speech they're defending antivaxers got arrested.

Stating opinion vaccination matter choice debatable opinion one everyone right to.

Saying completely false things cause problem public health punishable country's law. Making completely fictional stories people dying, growing body parts crap like legally deceit (especially financial motive antivaxers).

Everyone right opinion, facts. disqualified getting vaccine passport, vaccine work you. Enjoy blocked life. Ah! completely correct. thought number bit high. Thank you! many states testing, rising case counts now. Vaccines great, get one, we're opening fully effect.

Michigan still leader cases. death surge yet, everything else. Covid slow killer. Many states creeping up, solid unwavering upward trajectory.

Wear mask. Wear mask. Wear mask. social distance much possible.

If vaccinated, follow one unvaccinated family rule hang vaccinated folks.

If found post degrading demeaning, take deep breath (masked around others) go walk outside. probably stressed. be? What's more, seems mortality dropped compared last wave (around 2.8% vs 3.8% October-November). surprising ‚Äì lot people 60 already vaccinated group suffered virus (source: media still run news stories virus dangerous killing younger people wonder get from. never knew 3rd one hit Stuff won‚Äôt see CNN wait, think hear 2021 saying hold beer. got Moderna gave booklet says moderna need get second shot 28 days first shot second shot considered fully vaccinated 14 days second dose. going by. Maybe overly careful hey 10 days wait. I'm trying clarify statement.

Vaccine effectiveness deniers pro-mask people? 15 minutes post dose purgatory spent bleachers local high school football stadium gave shot. 

I love Texas We‚Äôre talking healthy person waiting extra weeks keep societal spread negatively impacting (up including killing) vulnerable. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much ask. someone say wave? Shaka brah! saaaaaaaay üëÄ Could couldn‚Äôt kill easily first time around it‚Äôs mutated enough able to? don‚Äôt know thought. beginning wave 4. Well throughly answered first comment nothing left ask that, found amusing write long winded comments figured wouldn‚Äôt mind entertaining line thinking. It‚Äôs okay tho. Thanks conversation. Hell, woulda Blue Screened early on. booster shot 10 micrograms making billions per month then. Current mRNA production vague range 200x30 micrograms monthly Pfizer 100x100 Moderna. 

This could also best way get world vaccinated 2020. Novavax also supposed making roughly 600 million doses month starting month. (That vaccine even better original strain worse worse B.1.351.) nice Easter surge come! really  get saying sure. mean hands continue advocate privacy whenever possible. EU scrap GDPR?

Again... I'm bothered vaccine passport reasons listed. I'm trying provide plausible explanation people hesitant.

Sigh. I've celebrated every holiday last year. life wasted living fullest. masks sight either. Also fact matter can't use AZ vaccines yet, would benefit us give countries like Canada Mexico use vaccine. mean get 16 doses 15 dose vial?  Completely misleading title. said expect 4th wave *as severe* previous 3. got J&amp;J. Side effects pretty intense headache, chills, body aches, fatigue. actually throwing night. also stomach issues could part (I take stomach acid inhibitors). Supposedly since young strong immune response fairly normal. sucks 1-2 days discomfort worth it. feeling better today. man intense last night..  really exclude JnJ problems. similar technology, it? Typical dems stole eltction corona didappear typical liars cheaters scam /s absolutely correct also important state incredibly effective Pfizer Moderna vaccines are. Even though (only) ~95% effective *preventing* case covid, happen get it, symptoms mild. vaccines truly modern marvel. hah, idea outrun virus, race parallel. One side takes away possible victims, side tries kill vaccinated. want side slow possible long possible. think she‚Äôd surprised chances actually are, good way Umm really, like someone sick stay home rest get people sick? It‚Äôs useful analogy Brazil though? even asking? divert conversation away ridiculous, conspiratorial comment. look cases Texas. Hardly any. New York mask mandate escalating again. yeah, they've telling us avoid non-essential travel regardless we're vaccinated not, they're saying ""we feel comfortable saying okay vaccinated take precautions.""

the fact nothing changing practically much country extent CDC guidelines ignored policy level. Take day week Anything less full capacity masks vaccinated unacceptable. concert isn‚Äôt concert otherwise. Thus far, Sinovac‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine received emergency use approval (EUA), conditional marketing authorization, 30 countries. facility quality management system CoronaVac inspected China, Brazil, Indonesia, Chile, Singapore, Saudi Arabia, well World Health Organization (‚ÄúWHO‚Äù).

In case somebody assumes approved Sinovac, hasn't. serious? one, indigenous people limited access healthcare. secondly indigenous people dying hospitalized disproportionately. country seriously f‚Äôd indigenous population insecure problem getting vaccinated?

You disgusting got first dose today too. Congrats! Great feeling.  hear: ... gather 

... even *nearly* vaccinated.

... ... even *scheduled* vaccinated.

... ... ... alright look, even necessarily *planning* get *actually* vaccinated, CDC pretty much says gather. That‚Äôs quite accurate. 

While don‚Äôt think Fauci that, Trump messed response pandemic baldy made Fauci look like leader country credibility. 

Trump one blame that. combination lowering risk factor 5 rising risk factor 5 really get numbers down.   Thanks! contradicting myself? pointing Chinese numbers fabricated also maintaining Chinese lockdowns are, opinion, inhumane way overboard. Thanks! even know 3rd wave. can‚Äôt go ‚Äúfully normal‚Äù evidence still infectious even vaccinated (although thankfully level viral load go pass on) people health issues pregnant can‚Äôt get vaccinated yet need protect still. line heard, pissed variation of: evidence vaccines reduce transmission.

This technically true while, *best* working assumption would. like Windows Vista: prolonged rollout many issues even work als lots frustraties Guy that's wrong since start spoken! Rejoice. definitely exist few/none kind position power authority. Leaders (governors, officials, etc.) want continue longer to. I've known six people gotten sick hospitalized, none vaccinated. Bad sinus infection moderate hangover comparisons jump memory talking them. stated flu worse. One week basically unprotected. 
10 days mayyyybe little bit. 
14, major jump protection. Indisputable fact? literally leave house get arrested. think that's handle pandemic, that's you. think that's ridiculous inhumane. ‚ÄúFour weeks government pharmacies start begging people come without appointment get vaccine, restrictions need dropped‚Äù... vaccinated. 

Don‚Äôt want vaccine?; Enjoy wearing mask rest life. probably living Florida/Texas. boss late 40's. day half receiving Janssen shot. Totally fine after, though. I'm assuming that's Akira reference super ironic haha People believe vaccine OS built Gates complete idiots clue technology works. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs amusing you. Would say flagrantly misleading articles reputable sources NYT also support lockdowns / vaccines? 

If so, would willing link one don‚Äôt agree with? hope able find extra vaccine soon! only??? Palestinians citizens Israel, Israel vaccinate Arab citizens. civilian affairs administered civilians authority, runs Palestinian healthcare, hospitals vaccination programs decades.

The Palestinian authority ordered Sputnik vaccine gotten tens thousands doses.

Israel went beyond legal obligations donated 5k doses Palestinians early on, vaccinated 105 additional Palestinians. Currently, part thanks Israeli efforts Palestinians higher vaccination rate neighboring Arabs Jordan Egypt. Yes! conversation someone covid reported same- horrible reaction 1st shot, basically reaction 2nd. Essentially already it, 1st shot acts like 2nd. 2nd shot much body efficient fighting it. rumblings people covid really needing 2nd shot mRNA vaccines. Well atleast within ""sane"" European county, expect ""sane"" rules. would pretty confidently say end month first dose....not end May....which something never imagined would saying. moving incredibly fast. legend Remove ‚Äúcovid‚Äù title it‚Äôs far scarier American: First time meme way never vaccination passports. incredible invasion violation privacy opens door insanely dystopian/totalitarian surveillance abuse. 

It's amazing correctly realize downsides constantly produce papers/prove immigration status/stop frisk think good idea. would continually added expanded upon, government micromanage hoops jump permission engage single aspect life. ""In order get haircut prove 30 vaccines/eat GMO grains/have drug alchohol free past 90 days"". 

I say supporter vaccines/vaccination/masks/social distancing, etc. What's legality making honeypot source fake cards, turning people bought FBI? Well, doses applied, people supoosed receive it. Maybe kept family member, probably sold. Exactly.

The endpoint pharmacists doctors twiddling thumbs fridges full vaccine. Yes, probably swap planning give Pfizer Moderna people 60 need cause delay still many 60+ vaccinated here. Walgreens better? I‚Äôm pretty sure two options live now, I‚Äôll look see find different local pharmacy really doesn‚Äôt. 

Covid us like 50 different Israels. 

Outbreaks national. we'll never attain 0 deaths flu virus. Going proper vacation soon mini honeymoon. vaxxed. Can‚Äôt wait. write someone gets vaccinated. slows trickle, know number was. referring vaccinated people stated before. You‚Äôre adding qualifiers try make sound wrong. Stop that.

If **vaccinated** need mask outdoors. Period full stop end story.

Even unvaccinated, risk outdoors low. CDC backed last summer. what‚Äôs point wearing mask vaccinated? I'm trial participant CA called stating I'd eligible April 15 unblinded (I'm vaccinated). I'm still study long term evaluations.

What I'm curious end approved FDA, do? need take one approved vaccines like comes potential vaccine passports whatnot? I'd hope since still remains effective vaccine that's approved elsewhere. 95% efficacy mean ‚Äúthe vaccine doesn‚Äôt work 5%.‚Äù means you‚Äôre exposed, you‚Äôre 95% less likely get COVID person who‚Äôs vaccinated. define ‚Äúnonessential flight‚Äù? Well apparently capable infecting mink mice. Mink necessarily common, mice... hope Biden ends travel ban soon. Can't wait travel US again. There's reason unvaccinated people Mexico able travel US someone EU UK full vaccine protection can't. Hopeful mood Fauci today eh? said hear 2022 it'll Sunday. Btw wont ever disappear it'll become minor threat like flu That‚Äôs great, it‚Äôs still hard find one. I‚Äôm 60s I‚Äôve waiting list several months county.

Go CVS / Walgreens / Walmart websites check, even busiest counties openings next week. 

The county sites harder get places. Thank daddy government saying ok leave city antibodies Pfizer vaccine RAGING body Cinco de Mayo. Bring margs tequila shots! already proven don‚Äôt listen, though, find ‚Äúif lie won‚Äôt listen!‚Äù wee bit bullshit line. ones going follow logic ignored guidance parroted line since March last year.

Science public health doesn‚Äôt mesh every time, harm reduction strategies. December guess would explain lot still want say vaccinated people wear masks yet. Gotta keep appearances mean [this issue frequently issue occurs rather cause. arguing something didn't. person responded said kids need vaccinated return normal. Health experts obviously disagree provided valid reasons kids vaccinated could complicate situation.

If person disagrees this, I'd like know qualifications make determination status pandemic, qualities needed determine things fact normal. 

If decide good kids continue spread new mutation forms vaccines effective against, think would agree that's ""normal,"" especially end situation like last year, jumped gun.

Health experts far better place average joe make determination what's needed effectively end this. article disagrees opinions, prefer ignorance? ""Let's stop travel forever fear someday vaccine resistant virus might develop"" Seems like speed vaccinating going NL lonnng time get gen pop 60. Yup, think we‚Äôre saying thing. don‚Äôt want get vaccinated it‚Äôs widely available, well ‚Äî that‚Äôs personal risk assessment wish best. won‚Äôt changing life you. I‚Äôve San Francisco recently, (and state) disagree you.

Covid 19 doesn‚Äôt spread outdoors like that. enough science back up. (I‚Äôm also vaccinated.) 

You wear masks want, aren‚Äôt going catch covid walking someone. 
San Francisco done great job vaccinating homeless.

Exemption CDPH website says:

Persons outdoors maintaining least 6 feet social distancing others household. persons must face covering times must put within 6 feet others household. Shut up, nerd thank much resource! added :) No. doesn't. LOL. goal 100% measurable, also attainable next 45-60 days.

Why bother you? covid? people covid get 2nd type symptoms first shot Think confirmed causing CVTS autoimmune vaccines demonstrated work many variants, given design (mRNA least) work new variants. honest don‚Äôt really know could try call local GGD asking mind right live outweighs right government interfere life. would better staggered vaccines case, can‚Äôt reschedule make sure stay well-hydrated eat enough (healthy foods). Keep moving gently stretching whichever arm get shot mitigate soreness. Sleep also important, sleep whenever chance so. wish once, journalist would call one quacks live TV ask mental health, impact working people, would feel government took job away months.

We need start holding feet fire get justify destroying livelihoods. covid last year pretty seriously. husband not. 2 half year old daughter, got Pfizer vaccine.

Our reactions seem pretty similar first one - felt pretty ugh, achy tired. like couldn‚Äôt function (I still worked home) nice take easy evening husband stuff around house (dishes, feed animals, take care daughter etc). got second shot Weds next day felt pretty again, terrible (or least long, say terrible aches pains hours). slept lot took care stuff around house. Today feels fine, tired. disagree, I‚Äôve better physics corse online person... wonder colleges haven‚Äôt offer online classes prior pandemic... I'm sure definitely going much less quote Marshall Stacker Pentecost battle Hong Kong, ""we canceling apocalypse!""  Another extremely shortsighted decision. non essential fights grounded. whole mess spread travel. vaccine work 5%. keep spreading cross breswing variant strains flights. no, air filtration systems flights fully protect you. maintenance properly costly. Huh, aren‚Äôt people traveling anyway?

These announcements strange. amount scientists giving permission things don‚Äôt control already allowed anyway. Four weeks government pharmacies start begging people come without appointment get vaccine, restrictions need dropped. point don‚Äôt want get vaccinated, good luck. would received Pfizer would mainly older people, would received AZ would far likely 65 (due vaccination programme worked), would naturally make ratio skewed. started vaccinating month ago people 60+ allowed till days back. Plus also exported 60 million doses (and still are) several countries need doses, something US done. u/FlyingDutchman1337 chance know answer question? reason think J&amp;J also reduce asymptomatic spread. would behave unlike vaccines order reduce it. Yeah. It‚Äôs strange. health anxieties all. trapped unable breath definitely big one. 

Most anxiety buddies health fears understand hard year mean different level caution people vaccinated vs. people (and cannot be, yet) vaccinated?

That's crazy! Anybody else get SUPER sick first dose vaccine? Temp went 102 pretty much every reported symptom possible. likely second dose even worse it‚Äôll mellow reacted like this? Got pfizer important. Gonna get either way can‚Äôt deny I‚Äôm little bit scared keep reading Israel one seems mention Israel's population 9 million. Percentages nice let's try keep mind US 36 times Israel's population changes things LOT work actual numbers percentages. college students on-campus OSU, UC, Miami, Kent State, etc up, crank shots. Efficient pay dividends. 

I agree idea way worded :/ No, doesn‚Äôt. link:

Persons outdoors maintaining least 6 feet social distancing others household. persons must face covering times must put within 6 feet others household. really happy see messaging become positive vaccinated. Fauci‚Äôs statement likely won‚Äôt hit 4th wave, feel public health officials mostly done doom gloom. You, apparently, think disappear would assume ‚Äúacceptable number‚Äù generally viewed acceptable seasonal flu. believe ~14 days get protection timeline looked people tested positive (or maybe even symptomatic). dug question believe actually start getting protected infection around 10-12 days (forgetting which, look study results it‚Äôs buried somewhere) reflects data 14 days   long swim Canada. won‚Äôt consensus. It‚Äôs 50 states acting independently. CDC gives guidance power enforce recommendations. state decide lift restrictions. damn well fuckijg dangerous.  Ignorance stupidity protect variants. 

This new pandemic, friend. Better listen warnings gonna sorry. Protection old people keep safe one. hope so. haven‚Äôt hugged another human forever. miss going dates going lunch shit :/ Memorial Day going lit, buddy. Local news comments: ""Stop getting tested reopen!""

I kid not. me! partner though ‚Äî sore arm. wanted hit Lmao Yeah, gonna need something little substance lot less feelingsball Lots money hell? Technically I‚Äôm resident one state, working home college classes (with parents) another. pre-existing condition. waited bit I‚Äôm also younger parents already theirs, tier opened 3 weeks got mine. residency rule either resident resident another state working full time one. 

Like that‚Äôs way be. Especially dumbass college students. Don‚Äôt get wrong...I dumbass college student...
But even ones going packed house parties still probably transient average citizen. would want vaccinated. Like flu vaccine every year? Almost every person know age 16 WANTS vaccinated received least one dose vaccine many fully vaccinated. absolutely incredible never thought would get point fast. thought would July 4th, earliest, would ‚Äúgeneral availability‚Äù vaccine. 

I know regions country it‚Äôs still incredibly difficult get access vaccine, exception rule end month. would absolutely shocked aren‚Äôt bombarded commercials billboards begging people come get vaccine Memorial Day. restrictions place 4th July I‚Äôll shocked. Yeah, no. serious? can't be.

""After everyone wishes vaccinated"" quantifiable number. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs take away... Yes, also thought weren‚Äôt sure vaccines even helped transmission, rush get age group vaccinated? I‚Äôm confused. first appointment next week. Suddenly?! think know much cases didn‚Äôt say anything. It‚Äôs clear why. need agree this, except month October guess it‚Äôs mostly like April 2020 closure wise Sorry point huge sacrifice me. Cinco de mayo literally day 2 weeks second dose. gonna lit. think anti-mask people following orders White House? literally difference. could always travel within US without test( except like hawaii). countries still ask negative test even vaccination card. Nothing changed get Israel it'll no-brainer. They're 4-8 weeks ahead us vaccinations. understanding % based sickness level case infected(for example, % chances needed get admitted icu develop serious symptoms case infected ), 80% immunity , don‚Äôt quote though forgot add post used home antibody test surprised numbers start lag approaching 50% since think younger people less enthusiastic getting vaccine perceived benefit. approve vaccine that‚Äôs significant issues overseas we‚Äôre track enough vaccinate whole population late summer latest Thanksgiving/Christmas.  Except no. vaccines extremely effecting even 1 dose. 

Pfizer Moderna around 80% effective 1 dose, bumping 95% second. 

So even first dose alone massive boost. Lol one employed anymore actually 1:60.000 females. Germany opaque UK vital information. keep mind many european countries allow use AZ elderly people simply enough data AZ trials. know younger females incidence 29/1.800.000 mil AZ doses. younger males 2/1.000.000. think thats pretty similar seen scandinavian countries, know incredibly well functioning health surveilance institutions. Still hasn‚Äôt case traced movie theaters vaccine? don‚Äôt understand would question. You‚Äôre protected that‚Äôs general safe activity compared to, say, eating restaurant. else would waiting for? U.S. CDC SAYS DELIVERED 204,719,335 DOSES COVID-19 VACCINE APRIL 2 VERSUS 200,496,635 DOSES APRIL U.S. CDC SAYS ADMINISTERED 157,606,463 DOSES COVID-19 VACCINE APRIL 2 VERSUS 153,631,404 DOSES ADMINISTERED APRIL U.S. CDC SAYS 101,804,762 INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED LEAST ONE DOSE COVID-19 VACCINE APRIL 2 VERSUS 99,565,311 INDIVIDUALS APRIL U.S. CDC SAYS 57,984,785 INDIVIDUALS FULLY VACCINATED COVID-19 APRIL 2 VERSUS 56,089,614 INDIVIDUALS APRIL U.S. CDC SAYS 7,735,342 DOSES COVID-19 VACCINE ADMINISTERED LONG-TERM CARE HOMES APRIL 2 VERSUS 7,731,353 DOSES ADMINISTERED APRIL 1 people stupid.

I mean bullshit, egotistical, selfish resistance masks...no wonder.

Plus...it's within realm White House walk back expertise basically Sociology.

I degree actually prudent White House walk back. Otherwise small allowance may turn whisper game upon national scale. generally trends towards people want hear...not good. government exists buffer/guide two. Oh know. :p call ask. much difference states even counties US, last directive unblind people requested it.

Source: Research Assistant AZD1222 trial US. debate profoundly stupid. agree point whatever idiots believe turdbag swayed debunking article. givesafuck thinks Since know vaccines protect everyone around now, getting first dose going end pandemic fastest. probably option get booster shot fall anyway. quoting? that, (of fucking course city) Orlando experiencing what's referred [""vaccine cases people catching covid *after* fully vaccinated. could nothing, could variant resistant vaccine, knows, pumping brakes *is* important things worth looking into. 

Tbh got Pfizer dose Monday I'm worried city, absolutely still get vaccinated, good reminder get 100% complacent yet. Can‚Äôt fourth wave you‚Äôre getting first wave. including crowded confined spaces bars

And it‚Äôs even weekend yet. year patience, blame anyone whose patience used up. continue wear masks public places.  math flawed, statement correct: 

The risk serious harm vaccine seems low, around 1 Million, famous micromort. itself, nothing worry about. found hit specific demographics harder, say 10 Million, would noteworthy side effect may indicate use alternatives. 

Birth control choice, people aware side effects. Pregnancy without risks, either... Got first Pfizer shot yesterday. I've never happier statistic. 226 deaths 16s since beginning pandemic. that‚Äôs threshold risk, require helmets use vending machine way, there's big difference keeping mask mandate despite state rule going away *during global pandemic* keeping mask mandate disease back one-off outbreaks like measles.

Most likely scenario people likely wear mask they're sick grocery store whatever, continue mandated. SARS recovery worked Asia. travel okay! 30 cases reported UK far. age groups included articles read. give hard time reminding tourism lifeblood millions low income workers around world. They're advocating people survive favor miniscule risks associated vaccinated person moving about. believe all. Appointments OSU filling immediately opened up. took 3 days checking every hour snag appointment. UK 90%+, hopefully get time Colorado opened everyone. many states. somewhat uncommon; something like 99% people spike antibodies mRNA vaccines.

There spike/S nucleocapsid/N tests. used N test looking prior infection (the vaccines make proteins). word (I'm US) standard Israel going getting rid masks period, including indoors? US authorities pretty vague right now, think want set metric realize can't met...  True, vulnerable fully vaccinated still point last year. P1 hit Europe really hard Per Pfizer's initial studies ""The case split vaccinated individuals received placebo indicates vaccine efficacy rate 90%, 7 days second dose. means protection achieved 28 days initiation vaccination, consists 2-dose schedule. study continues, final vaccine efficacy percentage may vary. DMC reported serious safety concerns recommends study continue collect additional safety efficacy data planned. data discussed regulatory authorities worldwide.

Soon breaking coupling case rates death rates, cases go still spreading. Gracias explanation! even read website? direct gather indoors unvaccinated people age one household (for example, visiting relatives live together) without masks staying 6 feet apart, unless people anyone live increased risk severe illness COVID-19. isn‚Äôt. read article?

We live era science people. CDC update first dose shots:

2,239,451 first dose shots. Last week 2,215,603

7 day rolling avg 1,749,362. 1,745,956 yesterday. 

101.2m adults first doses - 39.2% (up 38.4%)

74.4% 65+ done (up 73.7%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

April - 150.2m 58.2%

May - 204.5m - 79.3%

40% 4/4

50% 4/18

60% 5/3

**Total population numbers**

40% 4/20

50% 5/09

60% 5/28

69.420% 6/15

Nice see 65+ get nice boost. might keep going 80%+ Get shot get.

I would happy J&amp;J lucked Pfizer closer home auto-scheduled 2nd dose forget tens millions people who've already it! perfectly protected, also help us get herd immunity What's interesting variants appear fairly well distributed. Enough could potentially hide population pockets move around enough maybe mutate evade vaccinations (especially african ones). Especially get enough people vaccinated really stop able move.

The likelihood one pops back pretty scary. Hopefully claims able tweak vaccine production real. familiar differently cause death reported covid testing results reported? entirely different set people organizations. might well say trust numbers alcohol sales property tax collection.

Again, Rebekah Jones saying problem death numbers, I'll listen. Hey - Vaccine Fairy volunteer-run organization helps people eligible vaccine US find appointments (vaccinefairy.com). Could useful resource data showing 90%-95% fully vaccinated people carry virus (Can't spread it). 

On population level that's enough feel strong herd immunity impact. 1/20 people carry becomes basically impossible spread significant way. even approved kids, accounts ~20% population. Given anti-vaxxers, without children mandated, we're going reach herd immunity anytime soon.

Yeah get second shot next week two weeks party/travel time, lot friends gotten vaccinated, want hang welcome so, risk course. assumes completely vaccine resistant strain pop though.

That said, I'll still wear mask stores despite fact mask restrictions lifted state since children eligible vaccine yet. Cinco de Mayo expect things basically normal certainly 100% normal July 4th

I think Memorial day realistic states removing masks social distancing guidelines. May 1st date 50 states allow anyone 16+ get shot. people (the ones getting Pfizer Moderna still common) means even get one April get second dose fully vaccinated mid-May.

I imagine states follow early states like TX AZ remove month think majority White House certainly pushing late spring. experimental gene therapy üòÇüòÇüòÇ Also: people tend use antihistamines allergy season. Antihistamines immunosuppressive effect... others. I‚Äôm saying younger people stay locked houses, I‚Äôm 18 I‚Äôve going out, precautions like masks getting close people, small group 4 close friends. us fine, friends however went crazy without masks gatherings decent amount friends fight terrible cough 2 weeks whole thing never understood people don‚Äôt wear mask correctly one. went pick lunch 3 girls front ordering masks sitting chin. Georgia obviously mask mandate even bother mask ears aren‚Äôt going wear it. ü§óüëãüèª No, means people likely die vaccinated 99% need get fucking lives back already. Covid probably never ""over"" people need vaccines vaccinated, can't end? tens thousands still die every year. That's probably covid end becomes seasonal. Maybe lower vaccine immunity better longer lasting flu vaccine covid mutate nearly much. China  already answered question. Pharmaceutical companies get EUAs time limited circumstances EUAs allowed. EUAs allowed public health emergencies drugs related emergency. 

I believe major vaccine players ultimately seek full FDA approval, whether current formulations, new formulations may incorporate greater variant protection (though becoming increasingly clear may necessary). hope believe get point COVID longer public health emergency still circulating. useful COVID vaccines ongoing, long-term basis way annual flu vaccines. that's logic require testing boarding domestic flights well? Depends perspective

I tend feel pretty good someone calls asshole Reddit Oh work shouldn‚Äôt expect shit next day We‚Äôre gonna hitting herd immunity probably sometime July 4th Thanksgiving, policy still drawing board stage. 

I don‚Äôt see way get together domestic activities quickly. Plus, there‚Äôs way enforce vaccine still Emergency Use Authorization, that‚Äôs gonna change while. Around Late June 2020 varied depending live. article, CDC director warns people letting guard due vaccines, among things.

Agreed, never said research holds (and hopefully will), 90% effective means 10% not, 10% extrapolated 300 million people (and worldwide) lot people getting sick dying.

You're ignoring impact herd immunity. 90% effective enough reach herd immunity, 10% could possibly spread quickly become irrelevant 90% people still need socially distance wear masks, least time being.

Agreed. Probably need 50% fully vaxxed drop restrictions considering much natural infection have. Oh geez know can't catch ""fat"", right? lot time trials also include many young adult women. added risk get pregnant trial, minimally enrolled. girlfriend vaccinated. safe think movie theaters world be? doctor advised go, said it‚Äôs worth risk still :/ Hahahahahah  know people focusing efficacy. first shot alone 10-14 days dramatically reduced chance severe covid symptoms. alone already enough younger people decide moee active. True well, chance might come across it, probably anti vaxxers I‚Äôm saying subreddit won‚Äôt die. made 2013. coronavirus. would be? 

New Zealand gone month without case detected community

China also long periods without single case detected community whenever happens related strange phenomena like covid frozen food 1 million probability someone infected going regulations quarantines It‚Äôs changing 3 days. 1 negative test needed. *Can brand new day!* (Family guy reference) *Can travel safely still wear masks. He‚Äôs also big liar talking important testify Congress must wear double mask. 

Everyone room vaccinated put show without even acknowledging much lower risk was. could make statement everyone still risk high profile public official matter he‚Äôs going air side caution left wiggle room looks like partisan fool now.

Perioral dermatitis might look lot like acne, resemblance deceptive, said Dr. Carrie Kovarik, dermatologist Hospital University Pennsylvania member American Academy Dermatology‚Äôs Covid-19 task force. ‚ÄúPeople confuse ‚Äòmaskne,‚Äô two different things.‚Äù

With mask-induced acne, pores get clogged dirt, skin flakes oil, giving rise inflamed cysts may burst. perioral dermatitis inflammatory rash. various causes, tends triggered disruption skin‚Äôs natural equilibrium, Dr. Sprague said, use topical substances like steroid medications irritating cosmetics.

The humid, enclosed space behind mask may also encourage perioral dermatitis rashes form. ‚ÄúDepending kind mask you‚Äôre wearing, could really lot moisture sitting face,‚Äù Dr. Kovarik said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre almost creating skin fold-type area,‚Äù little like damp crevices form rolls skin.

That modify face‚Äôs natural microbial balance, research suggests, contributing perioral dermatitis related conditions. ‚ÄúWhen wear mask, you‚Äôre basically changing terrain,‚Äù said Dr. Whitney Bowe, dermatologist based New York.

This encourage discourage growth certain microbes, like bacteria yeast, may involved perioral dermatitis, touch ‚Äúthis cycle making disease even worse,‚Äù Dr. Kovarik said.

The rash appears often adult women, also crop up, albeit less frequently, young children. Unlike cold sores, perioral dermatitis bumps thought caused specific virus usually migrate onto lips themselves. even funnier I'm getting downvoted. Might me, really like 'freedom' travel internationally, I'll keep mask get vaccine. Maybe seatbelt burning party too, stop washing hands, that's MSM fear mongering. /s wife fully vaccinated Pfizer. going meet 2 friends afternoon also fully vaccinated. However, one found friend saw Tuesday diagnosed COVID. know CDC says don‚Äôt quarantine tested, would still safe enough us meet them? Oh really...it's northeast now? Lol fucking hilarious friend make believe bubble living in, basically zero restrictions South. Give weeks. 1/500 dead lot states Yes. let's spreading across media-stream yet. People confused enough info now. wait announcement til shortly *actually* available. populace already suffering info overload spread, variants, vaccine particulars, etc. 

All happen people start freaking 'it's mandatory - muh rights!' rumor mill conspiracy theories ramp up.  So.....considering timeline, including additional number vaccines produce....pin hopes realistic July 10. would cost around $1,000 per month insurance cover mandated work reason believe exposed. eligible, reason feel guilty anything. pays know somebody That's good bad news general treated. sudden onset seemed like symptoms AKI. would preworkout shake creatine essential amino acids. would become weak, muscle tremors diarrhea. always high blood urea nitrogen. Could covid infection pushed kidneys edge? keep mind counting based shot given. vaccines used require two shots. it‚Äôs second shot counts fully vaccinated. it‚Äôs 1% getting shot everyday. still mask thing don‚Äôt know could lying getting vax? every restriction entire nation lifted, persons businesses clear operate disease, bad would things really be? rate vaccination moving faster disease, not? One week CDC says we're heading impending doom, Fauci says chill out. Although correct, kind ironic telling take advice Reddit trying give advice Reddit lol. guess brunettedude take advice ""anonymous social media"", he's following advice time isn't, think it. Tell Michigan? Finally, we're getting new virus. Fair point Fauci telling truth. vaccines don‚Äôt protect well. ""Little kids can't help touch mouths noses touch things,""

Mmmhmm, think, age 43, eating earwax. justification loses little credibility ever government applying ""consequences."" logic, people free steal kill well, face ""consequences"" applied governing body.

I get people spout line say they're freedom speech. first, there's long line political movements found fundamental human right unacceptable. try skirt issue saying support consequences certain cases? oppose it, say that. Gotdamm, escalated QUICKLY! Mass easiest get appointment next day unlike lot places manually register read CDC website revisit travel restriction policy weekly basis hopefully next chopping block. I‚Äôm hoping infrastructure plan happens proposed Amtrak expansion comes fruition. Air travel become onerous security theatre adding mix amps up. Depends live definition wave is

Michigan third wave. fourth country? Illinois gonna third wave another week so. 

I don‚Äôt understand waves terms entire country north south don‚Äôt waves. Thank fast answer. Make sense, look that. studies UK Israel showed decreased viral loads. point one shows you‚Äôre still infectious even fully vaccinated response question ""what acceptable number?"" long &lt;50 almost always going ok entire time. Likely thrown away year life. trusting leading vaccine institutes countries, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, France, Belgium Netherlands. Dunno rest countries say opposite mean, countries mostly trust independent good scientific bodies make recommendations. welcome, we'll get I'm sure :) Canada. Although bit ""Well shit, point?"", important give actual incentive get vaccinated. Dr. Fauci making rounds telling people wear 2 condoms think might chance might hold hands coming month exactly motivating public. found NIH, published January. says around 8 months, expect vaccines provide around employers, including government (such schools), enforcing quarantine period despite otherwise voluntary. frees lot folks follow employer guidelines. That's true. Scientists constantly publically contradicting statements. Aside crackpots epidemiologist popped cable news, blaming scientists things specifically tried counter believe. They're young, congregate, asymptomatic (most important factor). Lol live Michigan we‚Äôre going lockdown despite doom gloom prognostications Centers Disease Control Prevention updated domestic travel guidance fully vaccinated people, lifting certain testing self-quarantine requirements continuing recommend precautions like wearing mask avoiding crowds. include wearing mask nose mouth, staying 6 feet others washing hands frequently. CDC lifting travel restrictions barring entry non-U.S. citizens places including China, Brazil, South Africa parts Europe. mean there‚Äôs plenty exceptions rule. I‚Äôm vaccinated yet even don‚Äôt get tested enter US, although haven‚Äôt actually used exception personally.

If it, vaccinated people able it. Considering PS5 outsold Xbox 2:1, think need revise game console metaphors. amateur doorknob licker, I'm incredibly offended think acceptable us lickers get back favorite hobby pastime. way coping life made many amazing friends memories this. vaccine basically guarantees can't infect others get infected, what's stupid fear-mongering? COURSE okay lick doorknobs. Shame trusting science.

/s IQ test use social media  Oregon allowing 16+ y/o preexisting conditions frontline workers get vaccine now. depends county. likely net-positive encourage people get vaccinated, prevent tons cases. Fair point. I‚Äôd say maybe freaky deaky new variant, it‚Äôs freaky deaky enough evade immunity, would current testing catch it? Maybe it‚Äôs plug gap real world effectiveness 100% effectiveness get bigger chunk vaccinated safe? Might also ‚Äúlet‚Äôs keep blanket restrictions place cock around proof vaccination, kind record keeping related that, etc‚Äù, 100% I‚Äôd charge I‚Äôm bit lazy.

Variants real, one main drivers continuing infections now.

Kids getting infected, active spreaders virus. yeah, need vaccinated too. That's moving goalpost, that's natural conclusion we're headed older high risk individuals get vaccine first.

Wearing mask supposed way protecting around you...but reality way protecting assholes wear masks wear wrong. public messaging perspective lot easier saying unlikely.

Except isn‚Äôt easier. CDC spread misinformation surely result positive cases otherwise never would occurred. Ya think? math. 80% unvaccinated, twice contagious, putting people young 20's hospital, already 70% known cases circulation. know vertical line heading straight looks like?

The virus care crazy think shit is, lol. safe, florida fucking wild lose either way. People always find way complain. say vaccines fully prevent transmission, get ""Then get vaccinated work??"".

You always lose, picking poison.  Leave Americans find way Wolf opening shit much days... lol. pandemic year long. dunno denigrated cautious. there's still much know, forgive wanting restaurants massless licking silverware toilets cleaned.

16.4% US currently vaccinated. 'the rest world' move number higher school district would facing SERIOUS legal ramifications.

They money influence individual, no, that.

In America least, rule law, might makes right, lack might makes wrong. Yeah idk types people seem like type understand actions consequences Seems little fishy considering cannot find link anywhere actually download it. way make ride smoother without manipulating behavior? What's point messaging change behavior? whether observed reductions viral load sufficient make someone less infectious real life yet clear, say researchers.

You‚Äôre citing unpublished, peer-reviewed studies. time open 18+. two vaccines: Pfizer Sinovac.

Uruguay good background applying vaccines population, mindset part infrastructure already there. limiting factor could they'll need doses. received 1.9M Sinovac doses three weeks ago receiving 50.000 pfizer shots week. totally agree. Anti vaxxers gonna learn hard lesson lol. everyone pretty much vaccinated, thing over, hello normal life. answered following questions: 
Did vaccines go testing trials receive EUA? 
Have countries granted emergency use vaccines? 
Are vaccines safe according emergency use guidance?

Second Pfizer dose knocked solid 24 hours 12 hours first dose. Felt like someone beat baseball bat combined alternating hot cold flashes. Also felt like someone zapping electricity body. Pretty crazy, totally worth it. Right Washington running messages big black signs orange lettering freeways. signs say, ""VACCINATED MASK UP."" makes *so mad*. Almost irrationally so. family vaccinated, almost whole office vaccinated, vaccination numbers going strong. total BS know vaccines work.

Pfizer founded 170 years ago NYC Charles Pfizer.  reason got vaccinated. don‚Äôt care actually get virus. want protect others. WTF

The article full people complaining CDC director literal said vaccinated people spread virus said most, that's it. sort like vaccines also likely keep *most* people getting sick all, people may get mild infection.

The article pedantic pointless headline even worse. received Pfizer/Modern vaccine, fully vaccinated extremely likely protecting others catching COVID. Thank part fight COVID! get feeling won‚Äôt mandatory back office order office. believe lot people know vaccines FDA approved. proved many online in-person conversations. give try, tell anyone person online none vaccines FDA approved chances confused.

Note none vaccines approved, declaration emergency removed, doctors longer allowed administer vaccines. Also, reason schools states allowed **require** person take vaccines FDA approved. may search NPR, New York Times, Washington Post trying deal requirement vaccination employees problem companies state institutions.

Trust me, people realize this. Let votes keep coming. would people vote comment already know?  variants really overblown. nice see current vaccines holding mean let guard terms variant sequencing masking (even vaccinated). predicted escape mutants fact many people are/were infected covid extraordinary escape mutant generated circulating silently. need get vaccinated, stay masked test test test. fact daily testing might thing saves us pandemic finally.

Fellow migraine sufferer probably due combination stress worry migraine going second vaccine appointment earlier week :( ""medicated"" best could beforehand icing head drinking much water could handle. read pre-dose anything beforehand, want fill good reaction body would have. time saw pharmacist almost cross eyed head hurt badly. quickly told got car, pop Excedrin (generally first line defense). told could actually taken beforehand medicating something body already accustomed to, pre-medicating anticipation shot. me, 12 hours later side effects popped up, little bit headache post vaccine Tylenol really helped alleviate that. Good luck! I'm quite sure syringe filled right stuff. empty syringe makes someone feel like total crap 2 days afterwards. Plus, AZ seems terrible handling studies data. expect vaccine give immunity around 6 months far turn 1 year they‚Äôll say need boosters etc like predicted many covid vaccine become annually shot like flu shot won‚Äôt one done mass vaccination. got first shot moderna one week two ago noticeable immune response expected I'd already Covid year ago. contrast mother immune response second one. Almost everyone sub knows vaccines haven‚Äôt given formal FDA approval. strategic decision based mortality rate disease far outstripping undetected harm vaccine. gamble paid spades. 

If yoi don‚Äôt want vaccine formal approval comes that‚Äôs choice. it‚Äôs dark secret people trying suppress. point hundreds millions doses it‚Äôs near irrelevant. Shhh

We're currently middle ""The EU nothing wrong"" circlejerk pesky facts like threaten disrupt Lol aight Specific pharmacies need find, sign for, arrive certain time at. again, logistical chore lazy (who still deserve vaccine) similar story second dose Pfizer. First shot breeze, sore arm 2 days. Got 2nd dose yesterday afternoon time went bed definitely feeling developed headache. Woke morning body aches fingers toes, killer headache, slight nausea 15 minutes. Took ibuprofen able get day started wear started getting chills fever (100.7 F). Took small nap fever came 100.2 chills went away. Took ibuprofen bit ago hoping tomorrow bit easier. 

I also asthma severe allergies also respiratory issues last day. would also without hesitation. life long asthmatic I‚Äôll take respiratory distress day. Moderna here, definitely little tired within 8 hours, little nauseous 24 hours.  


Worth safety IMO every part paying businesses close employees stay home offering everyone paid sick days? UK mostly using seniors risk seems younger patients. numbers look vaccines given 55 comped covid risk group? 2/3 team Germany, still LOOOONG road ahead offices reopen. first paragraph insult. didnt pla e anything. since wanna trash information, person know nothing about, know rest post pointless read add nothing value life. Therefor reading it. Tbh doubt anyone will. See ya void. not. Dont. Care.

Nothing like hearing Trump supporting father law say lasts six months that‚Äôs news turned US currently one effective vaccine rollouts planet 30% country already given least one dose 

So reason criticize us regard vaccinated 3.3 million 50s far. 1 death far. Oh yeah ruined batch 15M JJ factory last week also. factory making AZ also, mixed AZ ingredients' JJ batch. Must night shift! ha ha fair. please see comment below. burnout comes different forms. burnout scientific community unique general population.

not saying one better worse. different worth acknowledging :) FMLA Act apply Employer? Google it. Family Medical Leave Act. Check Employer even anymore. think ERs hope EEs know available. Federal Act. Good Luck. Maybe case. shouldn‚Äôt try increase that. risk vaccine higher risk covid certain groups shouldn‚Äôt used groups, even vaccines available don‚Äôt seem risk. Well large share 65ers vaccinated, thought skepticism vaccine driving plateau rather outreach problem. know lot people 70's 80's managed obtain vaccine, personally. Rite Aid, Walgreens. got first county health department website. They‚Äôve large vaccination clinics county fairgrounds. Good, please get medical field control. I‚Äôm tired hearing things like ‚ÄúI know so, who‚Äôs nurse/doctor/whatever, they‚Äôre even getting vaccine think masks don‚Äôt work‚Äù

Bullshit Yeah

He's saying effective vaccines medications/treatments likely approved year going shift medical intervention pulling weight managing instead asking public plot lives moments around COVID No, doesn‚Äôt. Ibuprofen stay system 24 hours, best take manage without it. disagree tbf really injecting Mickey D's directly muscles still miss northeast Iowa (Decorah). I've 11 years now! I'm southern Indiana quite pretty least. Honestly don‚Äôt think eradicate disease like covid. People don‚Äôt fear enough/are ignorant dangers won‚Äôt get vaccinated. always floating around group people back fourth animals. He‚Äôs reckless opinion. need everyone injected, man woman child. force necessary. sick days?!? got bunch people appointments Rite Aide Willard OH. bit drive, got first shot Tuesday become eligible Monday. Human lives directly related economy Using mrna research developed US university used US gov funded grants. Wrong! WTH dog whistling about? Governor Holcomb said also allows college students state/country vaccinated. Yeah someone else mentioned smallpox animal reservoir ultimately lead eradication. go. Also Small Pox regarded many Epidemiologists/doctors/medical historians harmful illness Mankind ever faced. look stats, consider long humanity lived it. makes sense. Interesting, would really become dangerous isolated child global population.

Do see higher mortality rates expected communities isolated rest world exposed? That‚Äôs like opening bridge traffic that‚Äôs 25% complete. Makes total sense! /s exclude outliers failing take account caused data point happen model used. get use model, look results, notice outlier, say ""this matter"", act like information within outlier show occurred. Like said, could easily take Georgia equation say wave even worse looks, ""it's Georgia"". 

Michigan may make 3% population honesty that's small especially larger state. want take far say covid really dangerous disease IFR estimates 1%? Almost everyone survives, deaths outlier disregard right?

And worth look states surrounding Michigan. Every single one experiencing large increase 7-day average. Hell Michigan even worst one - New York. enough proof Michigan anomaly.

Also, 7-day case count nationwide America increasing since mid-March. Small time range yes article off-base horizon another wave. Oops guess say hoax... pandemic control given country, spreaders vaccinated first. makes sense risk (but smallest spreader total) first overwhelmed verge healthcare collapse, unfortunately case lot big countries, like US. Ah Brazil, Europe Latin America I‚Äôm curious too. got 2nd dose week ago didn‚Äôt negative side effects. already answered question last sentence. asked video showing Trump calling hoax reference red herring border meant distract. Awesome. Glad hear it! I'm getting first dose Saturday morning, Insha'Allah can‚Äôt wait burn mine. Yeah wear hate it! Constant low level panic attack. anxiety people at! said it‚Äôs strange? Seems smart me. honestly pisses many people addicted COVID restrictions like masks they'll jump ass saying done minute everyone chance get vaccinated 

They're welcome keep wearing long past point kind weird virtue signaling I'm going exercise right put mine away Thank you! able book appointment Walmart, link anyone who's can't say certain prevents people spreading since that's science works.

lol thought multi-billion dollar question whether 6 months really don‚Äôt data, ‚Äú6 months‚Äù everyone knows subscription service real money lies days. inability explain COVID vaccines FDA approved sufficient determine know talking about.

Explaining EUA process way demonstrates COVID vaccines fail obtain approval FDA. Excellent. go Columbus State, boyfriend OSU. hope include Columbus State (I see wouldn't) this. went check appointments around today find one, although brother able get Johnson Johnson vaccine morning wait nobody else pharmacy. Censored Really? know how? work many elderly single one made statement. agree trump, open border policy USA work well coronavirus Miami? gender also factor. Young women far likely get rare blood clots young men. üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ It‚Äôs crappy Chile seeing exponential growth covid even though majority population inoculated rubbish vaccine. Agreed. hate big pharma too. hold big pharma stocks. really ground breaking stuff big pharma evil man, look fetanyl. Youre preaching choir one matter preach to. specifically want small vaccine company im invested eat much market share possible precise reason , top better vaccine miles actually get us covid. youre focused hate big pharma, helping end covid, shows, matter much mask ""saving lives/ end covid"".  Nothing convince IPs shouldnt lifted, want big pharma hurt, even hurts lives road. wont give lives consideration.
Empathy. Youve judged mine. ive judged yours. none matters. lose. end.  ""EU Slow approve"", today 4 approved, UK US 3. ?? uhh good news? yes says ""at least six months"" means might six months, meaning would pretty difficult vaccinate/produce fast enough rate, even little less year still bad; me, sound like likely wont end soon (if all) like everyone thinks lasts least six months? no...I support restrictions point usa That's trouble getting handle vaccination; right, quickly, heinsight becomes ""see, big deal"" -- slow down, look countries hitting quickly, get ""these variants serious, many news outlets"".

Both arguments true, different timelines unfolding different countries. Ok, two countries Communist rule. really feasible elsewhere.  Ehrm, piece bullshit? EU vials, hesitancy (and definitely US). I‚Äôm sure. think America 5 million may due counting delays rather actual vaccination. active case count accurate? 200k? know day day stats looking okay lately, wondering. Netherlands use aswell Vietnam comes mind, they've 35 covid deaths largely re-opened now, reactive local lockdown system place. I‚Äôm 22 fianc√©e 21 we‚Äôre set get second dose week. It‚Äôs nice feel comfortable seeing families also want contribute less cases school People losing shit really over. Unless you‚Äôre waiting 10 years zero cases worldwide Idk think there‚Äôs virus splitting US society half. we've seen problem number third world countries attempted lockdowns, nothing ensure people access food. result would expect. People violated lockdown orders alternative starvation, unlike COVID, starvation 100% fatality rate. Ah yes, one favorite logical fallacies. Alleged Certainty fallacy side Anonymous Authority. Macron going again. Oh wait... üôÑ Aren‚Äôt clever. Got mine Mt. Carmel. show people said people reported UK reported 0 blood clots AZ vaccine? Ask care. ‚ÄúThe FDA set adhoc review process accelerated trials approved allowed released public. AZ proven process wasn‚Äôt rubber stamp. It‚Äôs news development testing process highly accelerated. cited one top reasons people reluctant amongst hesitant group.‚Äù lot essential workers 50 got vaccinated. County website says 25% 20-29 vaccinated. 37% 40-49 year olds. Nah, swap AZs mRNAs UK. keep saying awesome vaccine, better anything, sure happy so.

Right? trusty grad students. wanted already. biggest issue Ohio people eligible deciding want it. bad thing people though? vaccines help stop spread, feel like might saving lives same. gettheshot.coronavirus.ohio.gov 

Should work best think that‚Äôs bug site appointment doesn‚Äôt actually exist, experienced issue booking. find appointment exist, take first step selecting time, second time automatically generates select well, moves next section personal info. Keep trying! Got first shot week, let know questions. country perhaps China done this? saw smug, gloating post insinuating people saying reported blood clots UK. 

People insinuating that, know lying seen that. like mysteriously read end quote went said ""it reported today!! right!!"" 

Not sure strawman, continue debatelord. 

Try reading article next time! data suspicion too, numbers reported Der Spiegel (in German) suggest really risk difference. Based data eight German states, 1.78 millioner women &lt;70 years vaccinated 29 unusual symptoms (= 1 per 61400). men, 864000 2 cases unusual symptoms (= 1 per 432000).

It surprise young women rare blood clots would also overrepresented British regulators Thursday said identified 30 cases rare blood clot events use AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, 25 agency previously reported.

Also read things like wonder many previously reported cases might come light next days. First 5 30? quite jump. makes suspicious like reporting media scrutiny it. Ireland SA variant surface, believe also randomly resurface community transmission case. know it‚Äôs already detected there. event, simply COVID test hand? quick calculation reveals 0.03% chance infected South African bringing SA variant - Ireland already has. late?

P1 found community spread several US states. 
Use open private window needed. Preach! Iowan transplant Northern IN. I'm still feeling here. real question COVID 10 miles driving Borman Expressway.

I, too, might choose COVID. think college campuses (at least large ones) also participating mass vax clinics using facilities hopefully little easier. eligible Ohio 2 weeks ago able get shot 2 days age range opened up. Ok good, agree EUA FDA approval. agree, none COVID vaccines approved.

So none COVID vaccines FDA approved? highest daily dose anywhere world? Real lockdown pretty clear. thing open hospitals, food supplied government, people leave homes. would've stopped this. confused I'll I've heard could potentially decrease likelihood spreading it. copied cdc website now

A growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection potentially less likely transmit SARS-CoV-2 others. However, investigation ongoing. Right- standard way pandemics emerging diseases evaluated. 
We truer numbers 5 years grad students pour data. New Hampshire everyone 16 eligible EXCEPT college students. told they‚Äôll return home states vaccinations. kid wasn‚Äôt planning return home west coast Thanksgiving, she‚Äôll figure something out. Went get shot today. extremely efficient. Walked taken station. Verified info. Taken another spot, directed room got shot. Directed waiting area. Dicked around phone 15 mins. left. Total time 20 mins out. virus spreads exponentially many new hosts infect area. Keep mind vaccinations aren‚Äôt one specific area. sheer numbers distribution vaccinated people reduce spread. I‚Äôll 2 weeks second dose 4/28! Can‚Äôt wait date night Lol. Standing corrupt exploitive pharmaceutical industry definitely makes evil broke! didn‚Äôt realize. I‚Äôm married doctor bud. know pharmaceutical industry works. business/marketing divisions companies don‚Äôt give shit people. get Tuesday! Oh definitely! get flu get colds easily past year this. issue still go beyond need safe paranoia combined OCD tendencies like isolating items days needed spraying things 70% isopropyl alcohol.

My mom high risk I've gone beyond keeping virus away. gets second dose next week things getting better. office getting rid mask mandate April 6th opening completely... I'm pretty nervous it. ""real"" lockdown feasibility whole argument. Even still, video Canadian site. must admit live Florida obviously masked times seemed appropriate, man thrown started traveling work north east saw people outside alone wearing masks. pedants replying post : **the danger variants vaccinated people/the efficacy vaccine overblown.** yet hear anybody seriously proposing proof vaccination domestic events get vaccines open everybody. I've heard people saying much want happen. Even governments enact vaccine passport domestic events, almost assuredly temporary get larger amount people vaccinated. Wow, stark. sad. Sao Paulo also resorted late-night burials keep demand, cemeteries authorized stay open 10 p.m.. Vila Formosa cemetery, workers masks full protective gear digging rows graves flood lights full moon coffins followed. 32-year-old man lowered plain wooden box. 77-year-old woman, whose masked relatives gathered near city Sao Paulo registered 419 burials Tuesday, since pandemic began. burials continue pace, city hall said need take contingency measures, without Brazil currently accounts quarter COVID-19 daily deaths worldwide, country. think people assume (correctly) tiny percentage people dealing shit. know 30-40 people gotten covid they're completely fine. think people choose level fear. I'd astounded alone could ward reaction. Guess I'll talk w/the dr. Sure hope there's lot booster shots future. pretty firmly established. AZ gave ITP (or HIT). Platelets hyperactivated, leading DIC, platelets used up, start bleed. die. single one people actual position power, least US. really even discussed except air travel getting sports events without negative test. Wow covid positive sub someone said protection lasted 3 months.. still pay insurance, can; everyone insured. Globally, many poor don‚Äôt access insurance and/or live countries burden supplying vaccines continually would strain available financial resources consistently provide jabs needed prevent wide-scale outbreaks. Pharma already fighting attempts vaccines made needed parts world, would lower costs. 

We Americans short-sighted global realities. behave America civilization worthy attention planet, necessarily home --for least. Yeah, argue elder appointment got February 45 minute drive needed do. insisted emails doctors would arrange tell go close by.

I kept explaining getting emails, registered every list, doctors informed everyone lists filled. kept losing waitlist.

You try arguing old person know exactly talking isn‚Äôt going work, also isn‚Äôt entirely think is. Various counties across NY hit hard winter saw 4x numbers compared happened spring. Take capital example: numbers still look bad too, 80%+ I'm seeing compared 67% Queens.

My county looks like spike point, ""hump"". plateaued. 
‚ÄúMore remarkable Korean Air flight attendants worked full medical scrubs wore industrial-style clear protection glasses ‚Äî mostly empty flight two Covid-free countries consisted passengers negative test results.‚Äù seemed crazy true. Norway really three deaths (1 male 2 females) people aged 39 younger? 

As american can't even wrap head around number low. complications illness lasts around couple weeks, amount time takes vaccine become effective. would think vaccine would effect recovery, event testing positive give long term immunity (something proven people suspect), vaccine would probably ensure lasting immunity. got me, know. said it? Someone must spreading disinformation re: efficacy hope doc tell drug taken beforehand.

Thanks. 4 bsod correct way say X number people died days AZ vaccine causes investigated. cannot sure vaccine caused keep mind evidence available. every time get flu though feels soo much worse cold. I'm least 2 weeks. =-( Move around frequently drink lot water. actually worked couple hours think helped. true, every metric, Utahs population done amazingly well thru shitshow.   15,000,000 doses, 15,000,000 doses worth single ingredient vaccine. Pretty big difference. fair, also left subset fear oriented folks well. That‚Äôs got CVS appointment family member. Waited midnight available days rolled add next day snatched one, vouch method.

Right 75% vaccines given Germany BioNTech, 20% AstraZenica. Proud say one doses!  party atmosphere got shot yesterday, big boom box playing ""let's get party started"" everyone smiling high fiving energetic, people working patients. Woot! hope won‚Äôt really don‚Äôt know. Enough people seem 100% supportive it. Thank you!!!! sick sensationalism. Media corporations really need get penalized this. making everyone scared everything Please let win Probably travel visas open everyone vaccinated though. 45+ vaccinated sometime June, things get back pretty normal, it‚Äôs crazy assume vaccinated student get student visa granted. I'd really surprised spreading while. many states extensive variant testing. Cells work OVA! Corona special who‚Äôs me? still enough delivered, millions dieses lie around unused. Yeah sorry that's irrelevant. arm body temperature circulating thing. get rid wanted to. Tell union brethren.

Meet lot union people also ultra right-wing. Pipe fitters mechanics specifically. health condition currently contraindicated COVID vaccination known severe allergy vaccine component, extremely rare yeah could prevent small number people getting vaccinated. usual way dealing vaccine mandates K-12 students exceptions people medically can't get them, states also religious exemptions, although don't, case kids end getting home schooled going private/religious school.

I think dramatically overthinking though, nobody's going ask vaccination records go grocery store. Realistically think come almost exclusively context international travel education, like every vaccine mandate we've recent history. consensus potential outcome vaccination (any type vaccine) covid positive? would influence case symptomatic infection asymptomatic one? Guidelines suggest defering vaccination case wondering based anything precaution? Would make vaccine less effective? People tested prior vaccination I'm thinking even matters might positive vaccination without even knowing that? lived Beijing two years. least there, air pollution. Yeah said 'relatively speaking' odd 3-day city lockdown ban overseas holidays seems pretty insignificant compared hundreds deaths day experienced countries. everyone reacts differently. second shot rough money  worry cost

...

If saves economy, saves money. EU wanted save money, spent money. Also you‚Äôre nova Richmond Norfolk that‚Äôs essentially everyone left... Right. OC said nowhere fully back normal. forever 

Right. WWII didn‚Äôt last forever, either.  r/festivalsluts needs new material answer question. made throw hands looking list ""essential workers"" 1c, Virginia includes Finance, IT, Media, Legal, etc. mean desk jobs people deal public probably working home. point kind nonsense. **Unvaccinated people**.

* pre-symptomatic - yes, big problem - meat pandemic!
* totally asymptomatic throughout - much lower risk

**Vaccinated people swab +ve**

* symptomatic - unknown

(would like wager transmission risk majorly reduced 3 groups vaccinated people) True, theoretically start processing visas August thats already late visa already takes months process So...many...of them..have exact water bottle bags omg. Thats funny hate too! gets redundant millionth time seeing it. don‚Äôt understand comment. saying data show AZ vaccine works? Yeah, that‚Äôs good description Deaths &amp; hospitalizations pretty flat around 1000/day 2 weeks plummeting earlier March.

I think we‚Äôve got 6-8 weeks left though well. Denmark really figured take care it‚Äôs people. American, envious. Age groups claim: contagious (transmissible) resistant natural immunity: lots sources ""baseless"" claims. data conclusive. Obviously. one would rather take chances err side caution. need apologize. August fine. true lol 70% Americans get vaccinated lmk That's good news bad news. Good news underprivileged can't provide adequate proof residency vaccinated...the bad news Hoosiers taking vaccine.

Also expect increase calls come visit family Indy since I'm country I'm months away jab. going lie tempting. stupid, right?

Yes. But, there's LOT stupid getting posted here, place. get two hours paid per shot $5 Starbucks gift card lol retail America stupid, right?

Yes. plenty evidence Brazil P1 causes higher fatality rate 'classic Covid'. single pre-print study mRNA vaccines effective neutralizing it. issue shingles vaccine couple years ago, imagine manage lists trying call people it. shot injected muscles. Unless shower dangerously hot body able maintain temperature muscles within fairly narrow range regardless whether taking hot shower. problem lots extremely stupid people claim got nominated award (and win) level petty saying Trump nominated Noble Peace Prize justify good president, saying.

Be consistent logic/ Whether export vaccines made country is, though, *huge fucking part* vaccination effort. Time start prepping again, got-demmit. Yea thought too. guess I‚Äôm excited finally shot I‚Äôm overly cautious making sure things correctly. figured don‚Äôt know maybe shower temp could temporarily make arm slightly warmer usual destroying mRNA, maybe destroy some. I‚Äôm probably overthinking informed really warned would happen let running trough population without precautions. hope gets better....it even worse know without Bolsonaro, could prevented... Idk getting downvoted. Anyone gets news Buzzfeed thinks creditable extremely stupid. I'm sorry, aware could catch heart disease, obesity, cancer someone breathing me. ban Brazil everywhere get shit together.. jesus FR, though - Canadian I'm glad we're okay hope best Europeans. want anyone else die need every nation beat together. free placement, not. family would safer everyone around vaccinated AZ vaccine instead everyone waiting 2 months get preferred vaccine treat spread symptomatically. Additionally [are around reason plague dangerous antibiotics. 97% deaths people 50+ (80% 64+).

The minute people able get vaccinated think go back normal. Hopefully later month. What? seen atrocious numbers get day 90? that's throwing away dose. 75,444 cases per million, Michigan 42nd 50 states, DC, Puerto Rico. They're even US' average 94,360 cases per million. 

Michigan's cases actually felling late December early January. They're likely seeing spike states already went through. Also people looking pick fights. Well international travel extremely, extremely different - different security policies - going grocery store concert. Moving arm immediately often helps. Sometimes using dominant arm lessens soreness too, sore dominant arm. Pinwheels, jumping jacks, stuff get blood flowing arm sometimes helps bit (makes look bit goofy public though) Johnson Johnson is, again, mostly American money. guy's point stands. money pumped research Euros. dollars pounds. full time employee? part time job that's par course. get paid shifts work get hours scheduled you. makes sense get paid work part time job.

 Anything 32 hours comes benefits considered full time. Full time also understandably much leniency PTO since supposed main focus work week.

Full time work comes PTO benefits. Salaried employees even flexibility. Also depending state paid sick days. earn days working full time take them, situation sounds part time since guaranteed hours totally different. realize obesity 100% preventable #1 cause heart disease massively increases risk cancer? really worried.

You're wrong, point little futile use messaging along lines we've using past 12 months. right today

clearly not, naive Don‚Äôt forget rolling 0 D20 checks both. 

Some unfortunate. regulators Thursday said identified 30 cases rare blood clot events use AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, 25 agency previously reported. we‚Äôre point walk pharmacy get one without appointment think uptake rise several percentage points.

Some people want find current process difficult annoying. mean, guess. aren‚Äôt many states could get paid affordable real estate. There‚Äôs many place country would live it‚Äôs worth slight premium live imo. hate argue Chief Medical Officer random idiot Reddit, but... hell guy talking about? 

I know numbers look like UK, know USA, 40% people get vaccinated flu year, vaccination hugely hit-or-miss different strains, ranging like 40-60% effective overall. 

That even ballpark numbers covid. extremely effective vaccine hit-and-hit strains lot 40% people going take it. We're already pushing 40% adults we're still picking steam.

Why would end looking anything like flu yearly basis beyond me. replied to, big reason get vaccine. daughter started daycare last week. Ewwwww sad WTF require international visitors quarantine tracker wrist bracelet ? started reporting since March 18th think overblown.

I think vaccine, certain variants (not them) become troublesome (spread faster, create worse condition, etc). 

The reality vaccines less effective too, others. 

Variants still big enough deal. yes lol

this blip wave 120 mil contracted Q1 AstraZeneca barely delivered 30 mil... EU's fault LMAO sum lol. got Pfizer shot. Second shot basically sleeping day got first dose Moderna shot, side effects pretty bad pain injection site. sleep side days. second dose, got shot morning okay woke around midnight severe chills. wear several layers order get stop. lasted two days, though midnight episode severe one. also welt size English muffin arm maybe six days. pain injection site actually bad time around. welt.

So yeah, that's experience. Pretty minor stuff opinion. Figures, live state lol. opinion experience, outcome result action(s), specific either positive negative result. someone views word positive connotation, would assume based person's specific experiences word, used within certain context. heard negative outcomes, also heard positive consequences. handle use 'negative outcome', struggle 'positive consequences'. vaccinated catch covid vaccinated? Yeah guess really depends do. live Boston Massachusetts ample sick days, vacation time, paid well. goes wife. house 115 yrs old 1,800sq ft still $500k, taxes $5k year. It‚Äôs definitely worth opinion.  Nobody told D00merism gets clicks.

For-profit press cancer. right, confused statement well. He‚Äôs correct would need booster vaccine every year cover variants original vaccines less efficacious against. No. smug, literally reported today, yeah, right point. 

And still 18,000,000 absurdly small. Agreed, vaccinate fast enough! says AstraZeneca UK obligation would prevent EU vaccine supply lack vaccines EU AstraZeneca's fault. 120 mil contracted Q1 delivered 30 mil... mRNA vaccines even tech able manufacture them. strategy US EU manufacture give out. US already tentatively said going help Canada Mexico we've produced enough US.  That's everyone reported. source read said 15,000,000 doses contaminated. Might true, that's agencies reporting. People attack Fauci seem strange spell.

I'm saying guy *god* like accuse. can't remember last time watched Fauci clip interview. think he's become punching bag emotional people tend think clearly.

Are sure medical school? watched CNN interview head people covid response team. one thing stood unprepared procedures place. Thus creating mass confusion do. time got figured heading April. told climate change would uproot life. Planning vacation Utah, mostly national parks. us fully vaccinated definitely open adding fuck yes days Vegas things keep progressing like 4th! Looking state charts (Indiana) seems 50-70 might stay longest. Younger people average less time assume heal faster older average slightly less time assuming large share end dying time. Agreed, think meant say available would make sense grammatically. may subtle differences ""don't"" ""can't"" explained appropriately. 4 weeks... ‚Äúlockdown extended 2 weeks‚Äù didn‚Äôt Canada manufacture vaccines then? 
I feel really bad Canadians right now, Big Brother always watching. family Toronto they‚Äôre pissed government. Trudeau joke long while. Studies shown vaccinations eliminate hospitalization death cases. I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre fairly healthy, that‚Äôs one less concern. everyone gets vaccinated, we‚Äôre avoiding hospitalizations deaths country would result full reopening. *cries Canadian* part number! attorneys idiots. 

Well, showed them. redditor either overrexaggerating whatever reason extremely rare situation. I've worked everything restaurant, construction, white color corporate, silicon valley start owning business. job treats employees like operation long. America work culture modern day slavery like many redditors would like believe. wildly popular Virginia. Asian countries government-mandated masking flu season, people get ideas? Good. comments stem reply OP whining vaccine passports. realize changed subject. companies lie ass 

And response subreddit pull theories one's ass, like, ""all need booster shot.""

We live four coronaviruses regularly reinfect us time. would coronavirus one done virus? would expect first place?

The reason people would believe led believe would actually get Covid vaccination first place. told us get-go would need come back every year fresh vaccination nobody would show first one. literally came lockdown like month ago. experienced mobile computer. co-workers issue computer better luck trying different near area codes. Smallpox actually successful vaccination program. Polio still around parts Pakistan India. Right, ways. Right I'm saying they're going likely staying home summer parents house, seeing peers much they're crammed campus together, still risk infectong parents, families, feel like there's also pretty good chance they'll spending time bubbles socializing much would school. saying theyd probably better focusing getting vaxed fall semester begins. Yup first dose too, last Friday. tired four days also major brain fog. Yes. EU totally start messing private commerce private companies private clients.

EU stole Australias vaccines weeks ago. glimpse one aspect life someone ADHD. one keep lights then? water running? producing delivering magic ""government supplied"" food?

People like understand world works. that. There's study showing young people infected P1 10x viral load.  
SARS, MERS Influenza infected people higher viral loads worse outcome. sure sars-cov2 yet though. lot reasons believe P1 increase severity.


Study suggesting 10x higher viral load force necessary. 
 
not sure sarcastic that's terrible idea lol people infected arent vaccinated, week 60+ year people vaccinated two doses.
The rise cases stupid government choices, like opening schools, giving permises vacations opening shopping centers  Yep pretty much every state union going honor system unless suggestion efficient way check credentials, honor system simply best way go really check third leg homie. pfizer &amp; moderna bless Wearing mask feeling fine wearing it, oddly. I'll adjust wearing mask, zero issues less visible. speaking Canada US? Primary, intermediate, secondary, post-secondary, above? Nice. mistrustful

WTF dude?  Sorry that! Yeah, talking California. shipment 360,000 Made-in-India COVID-19 vaccines arrived Yemen, part first batch 1.9 million doses receive throughout year, ""game changer"" ""milestone"" fight pandemic country, health officials said. Curevac trial here... second dose symptoms exactly EU chased tech manufacturing countries thrive america america embraces rewards innovation. 

The EU ""free stuff"" culture sucks. Glad US UK shaking free them. They'll thrive now. meanwhile, wisconsin repubicans shit final dump (.. now) entire state blocking first-term democrat governor virus/mask related executive orders. statewide mask mandate... dat's april fools, either. really. variants serious one country, serious countries. find sort funny people local subs say things like, ""if open state 2 million people now, it'll open door variants created."" principle, agree, individually part stop variants created. practice, I'm inclined think *maybe* one 7 billion people share earth likely create dreaded vaccine-escaping variant, maybe we're bit helpless regard.

Reality: Variants overblown get people hooked media. They're wonderful cash cow companies. pose threat, likely small factor this, vaccines still largely prevent hospitalization death even cases. Virologists concerned them, lot experts concerned lot things. mean need be. variants make impact, it'll probably prolonging tail pandemic, dramatic surge. back hugging grandma COVID deaths background noise while, possibly years.

They export ban buts mean anything. 

If EU try cheap haggle euros might secured better contracts Pfizer Moderna. Tropes exist reason.

We'll shout rooftops US grows heart stops selfish greedy monstrously evil. Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia Slovakia, countries said need.

Everyone needs we're locked shit want either. *""An export international trade good service produced one country sold another country.""*

If private companies produce doses EU send places, definition export EU. both. takes intelligence say dumb shit saying. Cheers vaccines take 14 days effective?

Science incredible. *""An export international trade good service produced one country sold another country.""*

If private companies produce doses EU send places, definition export EU. Oh fuck.... So, still Johnson&amp;Johnson company therefore American money. can't both? I'm offended. look profile says ""If reading this, won. lost."" hope enjoy this. Personally I'm glad know trolling actually brain dead, bored. Germany always had. Even federal republic. chancellor president nazi germany time already. wonderful take trip worry catching covid? :) Pfizer paid 100% development costs Pfizer-BioNTech. 

What Germany paid ""loads money"" manufacturing facility Marburg that's basically. September 2020 Pfizer BioNTech already successful candidate developed final stages clinical trials. 

I know Curevac know 0% doses administered far. 

The actual development, clinical trials, approval process paid Pfizer. terms agreement, Pfizer pay BioNTech $185 million upfront payments, including cash payment $72 million equity investment $113 million. BioNTech eligible receive future milestone payments $563 million potential total consideration $748 million. Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine**.

No, whole thing AstraZeneca *hasn't*. 90M AZ doses EU paid receice now, received 30%. also provided extra initial funding AZ doses stockpiled ready day approved - got mean EU exporting vaccines

*""An export international trade good service produced one country sold another country.""*

If phone manufactured China sent USA, exported China. Likewise, vaccine manufactured EU sent abroad, exported. literally definition word.

And EU companies production facilities well, what's difference? example, German Biontech actually designed Pfizer/Biontech vaccine, owns Marburg plant produce 750 million doses anually. actually relevant case. wonder death ration within age group similar health problems got covid time. best news, looked bad days back Numbers reported Saturday shots done Saturday. claim. know. manufactured private company. european union factory.

Even AZ made 30% vaccines given 55s, would 2.85 million young people. reality, 50% more. three :)! dipshit antivaxxer inlaws though. going everyone visit easter hosting daughter newborn. That's really true. production inside EU output far US opening Marburg factory surpass it. see beginning march az doses began overtaking Pfizer. cohort 6 (16 65 year olds) began receiving vaccines. Allowing exports az profit oriented.

If someone gives (and everyone else) IP seams reasonable allow exports.

Next time question UK give IP US, EU India. Would better give counries block exports.  really wants go Massachusetts‚Äôs opens everyone. ask ID, proof residency school/work.

That‚Äôs whether want break honor system not, putting Might link fact uk started giving 2nd dose? Yeah, EU vaccine coordinator thinks go faster, government gotten burned delays (it originally made deal regions everyone 18 would fully vaccinated July 1) taking cautious approach new promises. regions, actually vaccinations, pretty mad cut deliveries probably negotiated overly extended goal don‚Äôt get blame they‚Äôre overwhelmed vaccine deliveries summer. wouldn‚Äôt apologize. Reddit users frequently sarcastic expect everyone read minds. Here's study question: mean follow-up 140 days, nearly third individuals discharged hospital acute covid-19 readmitted (14‚Äâ060 47‚Äâ780) 1 10 (5875) died discharge, events occurring rates four eight times greater, respectively, matched control group.

Aside that, fire *ill*, would find something else fire for. problem US 'at will' employment employers fire almost reason deny unemployment unless prove documentation wrongly fired. Norway one safest places world throughout pandemic. doubt change vaccination done. booster shots coming, doubt Norway far behind. Noticed. Yikes. hope coincidence. Memorial Day would say people would informally moved on, although Pearlclutchers virtual signaling states No, shouldn‚Äôt, need them. Better fewer doses promised none. Japan isn‚Äôt pro-company enough... Come America! first AZ vaccine couple days ago. alright 12 hours later. 

I got chills, fever aches.

A day later fine. I'm happy know immune system should.  really think someone said much work us it, let us buy others? spare capacity used? first think anyone look domestic production capabilities. Some, like Canada, warned scientists last corona epidemic issue, chose ignore late. they're talking producing locally. Well, vaccines exported US (aside limited number sent Japan 4M AZ doses lent Canada Mexico). matter reason behind this, matter fact basically doses exported.

And regarding raw materials, arguing whether right wrong - make opinion. merely stating fact US blocks raw material exports, leading doses produced US less parts world.  comment linking disrn.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I responded OP, said dipshits unvaccinated spreading it. COVID know difference refused vaccine ineligible, lump together? seeing 1,188 yesterday? [CDC great, constitute incredibly fast.

However, big states like [California reconciling old deaths 917 may even accurate. I've seen, common practice places like Dallas, Salt Lake City, others. tells us Winter far worse thought, probably give us great idea current trends.

I'm reading hopeful things assays imperfect good indicator Moderna's real T-cell response. same, I'll hold onto hope. also massively under-delivering UK. approved vaccinations earlier, started vaccinating December delaying second doses. That's ahead. They‚Äôre around today, don‚Äôt see ravaging populations various continents. better treatments covid year ago mainly spreads symptomatically well. technology testing covid also improving. 

Reports coming showing various vaccines effective, even mild drop effectiveness, variants. Israeli data undeniable. Millions data points showing precipitous drop cases deaths certain level population vaccination reached. 

Humanity winning fight. Same! two year old never experienced around another child Six months??? That‚Äôs it!? Cool. apply literally all. That's ""refuse"" means.

[Relevant missing point entirely. posts suggest vaxxed people pose significant risk unvcaccinated folks, demonstrably untrue. need continue mask mandate purely social one- way distinguish vaccinated person unvaccibated person public, dropping mask mandates would encourage unvaccinated either lie status generally behave irresponsibly, therefore must remain place everyone reach high enough threshold lift it. nothing keeping unvaccinated people safe people completed shots. use much it'll house's waterways blocked next. imperfect plan executed violently slowly trying perfect

You even see among U.S. states. friend California **just today** became eligible vaccine there, 50. never mind significant heart surgery, BMI 30 40 -- none conditions qualified previously CA's painstaking approach vaccine priority

Evolution doesn‚Äôt happen century scale. Europeans didn‚Äôt evolve better diseases, exposed young better equipped deal them. 

Just like went 100 years without vaccine, we‚Äôd point everyone alive grown world covid existed, hence people (maybe even most) get infected young, better equipped deal it, develop antibodies, making common cold foe them. 

But nope, evolution happens 100 years right? current surge still starting, peaked yet. hope cause pain long wait get first shot today. know people still waiting though. would suck getting every year especially since isn‚Äôt enough go around yet. worked Japan, people indeed masked sick.

Its probably comparable all, since looks like UK giving AZ mostly old people many european countries wasnt even allowed groups beggining given mostly young people. think approves payment coordinates distribution vaccines? think pharma companies donating distributing vaccines free goodness heart?

Also, link shows 16 mil az, bot 20. os sub filled peolple hellbent misinterpreting data? always hear passports take long time get process.

Biden that, companies manufactured vaccines did. process developing vaccines ramping vaccine manufacturing already place Biden became president. would carried regardless president was.

We could president last months vaccine production distribution would roughly now. first pfizer shot today. given paperwork clearly stated vaccine approved. people able read, aware EUA. mean. Neither countries/regions perfect learn other. 

I agree Europe achieve react faster. EU trouble? That's great know! country vaccinations per age group far, something targeted that? (I'm curious since Portugal age-only strategy simplify logistics) We‚Äôre 5.7 million total, small country. compliance culture, follow government instructions lock downs. wear masks without getting upset ‚Äòmuh freedoms muh rights‚Äô. unemployment benefits quite good too. [Time hello, would like subscribe turtle facts Would anything different otherwise? We'd want ensure safety population first whether outbreak contained not. mistaken, looking PA's numbers, #1 state vaccination rate per capita bottom 10 states vaccine distribution long time, top 15 states overall... Puerto Rico listed separate country? article said US added Puerto Rico listed one states (i.e. nations) added list. give companies tax benefits incentives? world vaccinating 15.6 million people day every country wants put citizens first. too. said, think it‚Äôs good cautious prepare worst. list countries covid deaths divided population 65? Seems like would important way measuring different countries' covid responses *is* data effective people 65. there‚Äôs also data may dangerous people 65. 

This isn‚Äôt confusing. really hope sake you‚Äôre playing dumb try make point. Thirteen dead 25,241 sick Norwegians 0-49 last year 500x worse 1 million.

regardless, im getting shot save life. I'm living belief herd immunity contributing getting lives back normal. where's spam button I've always heard about. misread me.

Immunity isn‚Äôt going away all. Ever. Yes, absolutely changed point look rest country outside Michigan distinct new wave. Michigan clear outlier point. like seen before, last summer larger states carried numbers US. far smaller scale was. Neither influenza virus pandemic 1918. still always be, constantly mutating. That's get flu shots. covid handled herd immunity reached (and DATA collected), less issue influenza virus. 5 u/adotmatrix

edit: sad, guess use day? Ya I‚Äôd never seen much blood shot. seat car lol nothing anyway. infinite variants. flu, mutates constantly

Sorry man. say something. cannot vaccinated coronavirus reason cant roll HIV vaccine. Mutations. Oh people still get sick die even 100% vaccination. gotta live pfizer seem release data moderna? Pfizer wins Good bot thier website probably email address  Dealing lot vaccine jealousy right now. want stay informed, thread makes want cry sometimes. Posted 7 hours ago! Hope went well!!  need weeks vaccinations cases rising. It‚Äôs much longer.  don‚Äôt think people get vaccine knowingly COVID.

But allergy season, lot people could mildly symptomatic covid believe allergies, therefore get tested, still get vaccine. Or, someone could asymptomatic knowingly contact positive person, therefore get tested, still get vaccine. 5.6% population currently covered. That's behind EU countries terms percentage vaccinated EU great roll stretch imagination. going take awhile vaccinate way surge. 100% effective dying! That‚Äôs take for. got kids, get sicknesses time. unlikely can't eradicate it. may take though.

You look mutation rate covid vs flu, latter mutates much much faster. means aptly prepared vaccines deal virus. However scientists even suggested low mutation rate could lead virus fading famous herd immunity kicks in. understand everyone experiencing burnout way. yet experience scientists actively working remedy pandemic likely different general population.

imagine working topic well year also dealing folks pooping scientific work smearing said poop politicians, media, internet, etc. all. over. the. place.

I think brings burnout new level. Tanzania problem area. countries bit spike, many countries implemented restrictions within month detection original strain. serious lockdowns past 6 months, exception South Africa? lockdown suppression strategy = tons COVID. Dead yet? year race virus vaccines. 1/3 population least partially vaccinated LEAST 10% population already infected. would mean something like 40+% population kind immunity I'm optimistic wave bad third wave. nursing homes elderly folks seeing much higher vaccination rates general population, think hospitals nearly strained. 

I want say worst behind us, woods yet. Get damn vaccine, wear mask, help ensure put behind us summer. cousin didn‚Äôt test positive 10 days exposure asymptomatic brother. symptoms test finally came ack positive. 

It happen. Idk astra johnson johnson/jansen seem like best choice. I'm basically living hermit right mind waiting best choice there. go yeah definitely beats raw dogging covid without vaccine. won‚Äôt. don‚Äôt 95% effective flu vaccine effective subspecies strains flu virus. soothing. may recommend watching [eat comment history really looks troll worthy certainly getting vaccinated, sense security comes blindly trusting government. lot people comfortable that. people think know better experts, trust experts tell truth. See uneducated entire topic.. yet make bombastic claims Pfizer says variant protection?

Its China's version Pfizer...which way. Pfizer version inneffective south african french Variants. That's lockdowns returned trusting Pfizer tells look data countries use words like ""Should"" ""May"" ""Might""  also agree sloppy approach works better. Tiers: critical patients healthcare workers everyone else. also wait people make minds. People want go get fence sitters see people react. Except established causation lost 19 minutes watching this? life really sad countries similar profile? Brazil pretty unique state disaster.

Hi, article appears deleted replaced different article. tried find it, longer appears exist title. such, remove post. Pretty much. Yep. state opened wide others, changed behavior since knew getting vaccine around corner. 

Now first shot (got yesterday!), I'm going keep I'm I'm waiting second. There's need go start taking risks solid immunity weeks away.  first shot 28th eligibility 16+ opened 24th, come soon enough me. missed day work since started, sadly wearing mask washing skin hands much changed day day life. Wife luckily shots since works school. Yes. Get first vaccine can. African countries would be? Can‚Äôt think many aside perhaps Tanzania careful.

I'm stoked getting first shot tomorrow hope become carrier get sick Even assuming poor nations properly manufacture vaccine - takes many millions dollars investment facilities, equipment, skilled labor - cost developing vaccines borne people invested money expecting investment returned. start forcing pharma companies give away R&amp;D free, pharma R&amp;D, vaccines medications. think might happen?  makes sense states even allowed people young get vaccinated yet, started recently. makes sense going cases people vaccinated, numbers going skew toward groups people been. bet they‚Äôll re-elect him. saying 8 months now, government still trump 3 months infection, made wonder. Here‚Äôs something seriously needs mentioned: time goes on, deaths people refuse get vaccinated. Thats i‚Äôm saying  mean show increasing, correct lag. main thing worry rate change increases significantly, far bump seeing week par (I'd say slightly it) average increase last two weeks. vaccines I'd quite certain start new wave, seeing cases Israel Israel 50% adult population vaccinated much optimistic time around. also slightly increased time period leading that. comparable country, state like Michigan much different situation. seems retail close time. got first shot today well know people getting next days. actual affects minimal / restrictions Covid Sweeden, Brazil, countries took similar approach?

I know nations opted much various reasons. result kind policy been? Good. Start jobs. already posted Reposts removed. It‚Äôs based stressing immune totem already fighting infection. would anyone want infection snd vaccine simultaneously. going take least half year get enough people vaccinated herd immunity. predict can‚Äôt happen Oct/Nov. may reach people keep wanting go back normal quickly! mutations take nothing.

Everyone wants move situation quickly safe possible however, negativity towards countries vaccines nothing xenophobic everything historical unreliable lack independence afforded institutions charged oversight. recent example coverup Chinese officials extent virus, Russian officials Chernobyl etc etc. saying doesn‚Äôt happen west however, powers likely held account know hence encouraging avoid questionable dubious decision making.  definitely suspect covid live quite rural America due much less pressure conform safety guidelines, including getting vaccine. European Union¬†has ordered 80 million doses vaccine option buying additional 80 million, US secured 200 million doses option purchasing another 300 million. UK, Japan, Switzerland, South Korea also reserved doses. Canada, also approved drug, reserved 40 million doses.  caught crossfire: every place could taking advantage vaccine production capacity controlled outbreak weren‚Äôt using contemplating boosters (for ourselves). fine! congrats!!

It coincided end stay home order though there‚Äôs correlation that. Exactly. many days year get off? Sputnik V considered, supply limited would negligible effect best used region large EU I've saying late April early May since December early January. said month recently Well, risk dependent whether it, MUCH less likely 1 shot vs. zero. risk same, it‚Äôs like standing sheet paper asking altitude higher. Technically yes, way actually matters. time different vaccines though. think people underestimate effectiveness Pfizer vaccine think that's really big mistake Biden Administration Announces Ad Campaign Combat Vaccine ~~Hesitancy~~ Stupidity think boosters would come two clue. seems (and medical background take grain salt) booster would one shot dose. Yeah people think it‚Äôs okay exclude important data points change point lol it‚Äôs silly. Good. Norway 40s died AZ, covid.

**Correlation =/= causation**, remind research deaths continue, ruled deaths caused vaccines reckless claim have. Wtf sinopharm 100% this.

Hopefully Chile, also 50% vaccination shows result since got mine 2 days ago woke yesterday arm felt little sore started working arm feels perfect maybe try live Grey open allowed things different cities another reason we're mess  hasn't

Chile already problems Sinopharm There's plenty reason believe vaccines prevent transmission. 100% time, that's standard hold medical intervention to.

People excited Pfizer's results good likely meant Moderna's would well. Vaccines work given widely enough achieve herd immunity. lmao Gardasil 9 HPV vaccine available US safe.

I fully agree comparing days week good practice - although tomorrow Monday screwy many public employees get days off. Neither vaccinated people

I promise lockdowns thing going forward Cool. keep getting annual flu shots add one Covid. live that.

The stupid continue die, course, ones refuse get vaccinated eligible. Fuck though, society cater stupid people.

The people feel badly people legitimate medical reasons preventing taking vaccine. hope sort solution found them.  want explain ignoring obvious downward line period? 

No serious. genuinely curious ignore fact dropping instead pick highs lows make claim doesn‚Äôt align trend.

Well, 90 too...   
   Nightingale died peacefully sleep room 10 South Street, Mayfair, London, 13 August 1910, age 90.) anything, mixing vaccines (in theory) give better protection using vector based vaccines, body produces antibodies vector well.

That Sputnik V uses different vectors first second doses, likely reason behind AstraZeneca effective extend gap dpses. also completely fucking phoning Herbert did. shit people getting UK tabloids. vaccines sitting around nothing 2nd doses. 

Not even that. looked germanys live updates current pace less 5 days reserves mRNA vaccines. AZ puiling bit even counting 85% delivered vaccines used. Well sure hope you‚Äôre right wonder many people die covid result stalling rollout. Would willing one victims respect? Reminder EUA widespread vaccination started December Pfizer likely early stage clinical trials. 

That say, first people get shot (around six months ago) still protected. known end date protection feel lucky, got first Pfizer happenstance today never wear mask. Refuse wear mask. maybe, maybe... mask around vulnerable strangers. don‚Äôt go flu. Absolutes proposing. It‚Äôs simple: PART. Don‚Äôt anti mask asshole. time table seems ambitious. Sweden, gets amount vaccines proportionate population, postponed target every adult offered dose 1 August 15. experience got flu shot years back. never happened since super weird watch happen!! would definitely take punch prime Mike arm exchange immunity lmao. still pay deductibles. Thank friend, well wishes yours! Im talking moving average difference March 15th 31st. Individual days random compare, especially different days week (reporting lowest earlier week, peaks thuraday friday). Thursday week 15th, 63000 cases. two weeks past day and, including Michigan, track hit 14% two week increase mark. still hate comparing individual days, comparing days week tends somewhat accurate determining rate change. vaccinated (fully), go friend's 1 shot **I** higher risk fully covered? 


My understanding vaccine mainly protects vaccinated, scenario **my risk** (or least neglegible) whether one shot two. correct? Go tell Brazilian people thoughts. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll quite pleased hear what‚Äôs happening sensationalism. could ring someone like you‚Äôs neck went bed every night would, sleep well! zero sum game. Every company world making much can. would change anything vaccination progress? happy yours, shitlord :) think getting Pfizer key decision rather using inferior vaccines like AZ. Moderna o's quite good too. I'm bit mystified we're using J&amp;J all. think sometimes people prodded choice might want make rather given ideal vaccine even inferior. collective decision-making would dictate offering MRNA vaccine everyone US would optimal decision given stop 90% spread 90% infections meaning everyone 99% transmission stopped. Even people get arguably better relatively small number going superior vaccine giving protection herd immunity Please seek mental health professional feel like life worth living. face trials tribulations life sometimes need extra help get it. Moderna seems believe two years time frame based decay values. hang there, Canadian bros O:-) get you! necessarily. J&amp;J actually battle-tested variants testing conducted height global spike Brazil South America. three good. sad irony employers won‚Äôt give day get vaccination keep missing weeks months work. actually okay job, though differ person person. That's issue. mixed messaging media giving. CNN bad right fear baiting. way stories framed (go look stories get posted them), would wondering people bother getting vaccine told nothing stop another wave still need mask social distance, especially sources saying vaccines damn good job helping body kill thing. 

This might outside perhaps trial going on, many interesting news stories know also old news now. many give channels much ratings needing catch developments anymore. That's good them. mention lay masks finally states relax mandates, less less reason people buy masks, therefore denying market profits they've making. 

True, governors hit miss, media, social media, too, big problem people seeing things. think people get vaccine knew could mean return normal. never said Pfizer last two years.

I saying there's big difference commentary Pfizer confident put 6 month time frame vs two years gov done fine job leavening extreme members party August seems awfully early booster shot, it‚Äôs less 6 months away. Unless it‚Äôs designed cover new variants. case you‚Äôre likely get one Norway without problems. Yeah, based [that end June EU meet goal vaccinate \~70% adult population. Nobody claimed mask-wearing Asia *solely* based germ theory. 

You, however, claimed *currently* isn‚Äôt, isn‚Äôt necessarily true. 

They wear masks many reasons decades. prior link explains much.  Talk lawyer. cost anything. employment allow fire illegal reasons, might several there. ""DOL"" recourse. still social distance, still wear masks good yet even vaccinated. still get covid even shot still pass others. EU 3/4s world vaccine's production borders. mean *the EU* exporting vaccines giving away instead vaccinating own. example, many American companies facilities Europe (J&amp;J instance). contrary, EU gotten every vaccine paid produce late troubled production lines. able secure JJ vaccine appointment mom &amp; dad (55) GFs mom (58), GF (21) got Pfizer shot three days ago. Feeling happy! Hope everyone soon. Supply seriously starting catch demand. almost passed mine lay floor ask wanted ambulance. don‚Äôt fear needles. I‚Äôm sure happened fine aside achiness 24 hours. Still forced. profession want condition meet. It‚Äôs wanted doctor right now. don‚Äôt degree medicine I‚Äôm eligible. So, much like nurses, I‚Äôll find something else. would amazing. definitely think opening vaccinations everyone help. vaccines don‚Äôt prevent transmission, people still talking herd immunity? Even 100% vaccination, wouldn‚Äôt symptomless pandemic estimate 85% country need vaccinated order achieve herd immunity coronavirus. point, virus difficulty finding new hosts infect, outbreak come American Rescue Plan added additional 10 days COVID related sick leave September. Notify employer reimbursed government time miss getting vaccinated. ""people"" read regular things every right say fully long term tested yet still show caution? right assume certain age group either...we know outcome 10years kids get it. Tests wayyyyy now.

Anyway, hospitals overwhelmed again, deaths increase even overall rate lower. got first shot OhioHealth facility Richland county. people set around 50. people coming Columbus Probably key point article: 

""It's clear year far significant spreader COVID-19 vacation travel."" 

In Germany's case, help election season population getting restive year restrictions. easier politicians tell people want hear opposed need hear, especially they're ballot. Trump also made similar calculation US last year. 

Regardless political calculations people's desires, virus going wants do. Europe masks, social distancing, widespread WFH significant number vaccines. Yet Asia many things winter outbreak, outside Japan South Korea, virus better controlled Europe. Why? track restrict international interregional movements. simple that. US promised 18 billion paid 2.5 Purely ancedotal evidence partner coronavirus first vaccine... hospitalised Corona also suffered quite bad side effects days vaccine. hand sailed Corona relatively un-scathed (mild fever cough lasted weeks) 0 side-effects vaccine.

It would interesting get statisticians take this. seems bit odd make definitive call idiot admit his/her mistake kind idiot important control border traffic closing border. Italy US, banned travel China early, also worst outbreaks.

Closing borders gives false sense security leads neglect domestic corona response. Go India! üáÆüá≥ appointments constantly reserved released. always people picking open times get mismatches syncing. get error search zip code keep over. don‚Äôt know EU (India huge vaccine maker) needs get stressed lot more. 

If EU would UK USA, Covax would die silent death: 77 million exported vaccines, that‚Äôs EU administered. Says enough still get flack sides. play figures enough prove pretty much anything. British variant we've gone ""not deadly"" (from Whitty) December ""significantly deadly"" March. recent research shows may actually deadly, winter made appear deadly. 

It's extremely confusing. first time general public accessing huge amounts in-progress research that's pre-print, non-peer reviewed without scientific knowledge understand properly analyse findings. every month public opinion changes vaccine / variant etc.

This peer reviewing so, important. 

As variants deadly, massive about-turn recently regarding this. Recent reports show fact found 30 cases. mentioned above: EU exported 77 million vaccines since December, amount kept themselves. hoard. 
When you‚Äôre Western country/region/... export, you‚Äôre automatically line fire. That‚Äôs one talks UK US.

If people refuse get vaccine, there's moral argument protect infection cost. get sick, due chance, due reckless behavior endangers others.

However, mixing vaccines way untested, especially mixing vector based vaccine mRNA vaccine. actual data back theory.

If understand correctly still able demand AZ second shot want to? *deployed

/s Oh nice Can't expecting sophisticated vaccines third world country Gucci belt though, no? get frustration need clarify things:

Since export mechanism, EU shipped 1,5 million vaccines Chile. December 77 million vaccines (!) produced EU shipped outside EU. (or difference listed countries total exported vaccines first link) exported Covax programme thus end poor countries. 

If nagging bad vaccination pace EU, blood starts boil: least export!

The US good programme running: yeah, export (though don‚Äôt call looks bad, say activated Defence Act something). Recently loaned (loaned!) vaccines Canada Mexico. Also recently said might need AZ vaccine even though sitting stockpile 30 million thought.)

The UK doesn‚Äôt export call ‚Äúwe first!‚Äù (Or words: selfish, ‚Äúwe called dibs first 100 million AZ vaccines‚Äù). EU exported 10 million vaccines UK, btw. 

So, besides India, China Russia, EU Western country/institute export cost programme. 

It‚Äôs cool bash EU: haha, late/cheap. Truth is: honour deals comes Covax. single export ban issued proof vaccines went initiative. 

You discuss AZ attitude blocked 250,000 vaccines Australia (which, imo, wrong do) end conclusion AZ inept, shady borderline nuts need there‚Äôs nothing much do. 

The solution EU would easy: every vaccine Pfizer stays EU (there 2 Pfizer factories world believe: US exports one Puurs export). don‚Äôt would unfair company entire world. Yes - I'ts bizarre really.
I've lots vax's like many people growing one put action time all.
My Late father flu vax's felt bit 'under weather' one day.
Yet vax voci seems ability wipe people totally 3 days bed...or worse.
I've virus based effects reported clear vax worse virus me. Indeed Uk reported already virus getting much severe reacyions not. Many course virus symptom-less would idea it.
I'll touching vax barge pole. country 216 million people literally nothing. Countries Europe 20 times less people numbers Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine funded 100% Pfizer. terms agreement, Pfizer pay BioNTech $185 million upfront payments, including cash payment $72 million equity investment $113 million. BioNTech eligible receive future milestone payments $563 million potential total consideration $748 million. Pfizer BioNTech share development costs equally. **Initially, Pfizer fund 100 percent development costs, BioNTech repay Pfizer 50 percent share costs commercialization vaccine**.

Is honestly kind propaganda feed living rock ? Cases skyrocketing 4 largest provinces given relatively small population cases experiencing extremely concerning. mention ""top doctor "" pretty much downplaying threat covid March, move costed 22,000 lives left economy ruins. understand suffer scale death infections us did, however change fact currently way nightmare due exception vaccine rollout Canada stairs yet another wave infections given snail pase rollout vaccines , months upon months restrictions. suPpLy cHaInS look. friend.

Block lol. describes experience worst day Covid pretty accurately. symptoms day 1-20 mostly neurological: tachycardia, blood pressure swings, dizziness, nausea, word recall issues, lack smell. typical symptoms all, seemed recover quickly. Day 21 suddenly hit chills, fever, back-breaking pain. police boy descriptor could find wax imagining beaten police baton body. excruciating. Though already blocked you, fixing mistake. website embarrassment people created it. 

The US provided **Sanofi GSK alone** $2.1 billion dollars. U.S. government‚Äôs Operation Warp Speed effort provide $2.1 billion Sanofi GlaxoSmithKline fund development manufacturing companies‚Äô experimental Covid-19 vaccine, companies announced Friday 

Moderna received $1 billion funding research $1.5 billion vaccine COVID-19 vaccine partnership U.S. government, Moderna picked nearly $1 billion research aid. Now, joining list companies take supply order federal government.

Under deal worth $1.525 billion, Moderna agreed deliver 100 million doses mRNA vaccine candidate succeeds late-stage testing. deal doesn‚Äôt stipulate timeline vaccine shipments, least publicly, include ‚Äúincentive payments timely delivery,‚Äù Moderna says. pact also includes option another 400 million doses.

AstraZeneca received $1 billion US 

J&amp;J received $1 billion funding, Novavax $1.6 billion... source Germany invested $1.5 billion research development? see link tables one graphics says ""it include funding manufacturing"" (lol why?) says one sources ""press releases"". lists actual sources whatsoever verifiable links. That's partially I'm using modest numbers. lion's share infections past 6 months so, think 10% natural immunity conservative estimate. least six months!! mean get go garbage process six months!!!??? Please, sign We‚Äôve gone full ignorant. can‚Äôt believe lost fortitude finish battle minimize casualties. couldn‚Äôt wait months. It‚Äôs neck neck race selfishness foolishness. COVID go Gary, IN? That's devil's choice. might choose COVID situation Ahh! makes sense. 

Having ""pan-coronavirus"" vaccine would great achievement! US better rely AZ right export ban

The US better produce vaccines. 73yr old mom never covid absolutely side effects either Pfizer shots. Nice see logical thinking sub instead commentary always stating but.. ScIeNcE, like shield anyone daring think maybe vaccine developed 8 months far less months human trials comes higher risk potential long term issue, even short ones heard AZ version. He's still pushing so-called ""early treatment"" (chloroquine, HCQ, ivermectin, azithromycin, zinc, vitamins) can't scream ""haha, Europe sucks US rules"" based vaccines one exporting isn't

You people do. EU sucks even without export lol. definitely bit crass would attend state. Simple targeted regulations key. Laissez-faire recipe chaos Yes! This, else would warmer weather make respiratory virus worse get paid take vaccine

-American did, bought companies send everything US gouvernment. data really showing getting first doses asap lot better reducing cases deaths versus focusing full vaccination. UK around 46% population least one dose 6% fully vaccinated, yet daily cases dropped 15 fold deaths per day dropped 23 fold peak. US 29.7% population least one dose, 16.67% fully vaccinated, daily cases deaths dropped around 3 fold peak *British regulators Thursday said identified 30 cases rare blood clot events use AstraZeneca-Oxford COVID-19 vaccine, 25 agency previously reported.*

*The Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said received reports clotting events following use vaccine made BioNTech SE Pfizer Inc.*

I still remember weeks ago sub voted hell questioned someone claiming EU falsifying whole issue since UK report cases. said suspicious UK reporting clots, way around. Well look that? lying, bot? US better mainly rely AZ vaccines severely underdelivered pretty much every region export ban.

And produce lol. learn words mean using them. Also, prior infection year ago doesn‚Äôt necessarily equal vaccination AKA people sick fun allowed!  yeah ""keep out"" doesn¬¥t work europe especially central europe

like germany 10 borders countries, 1 Million people day either enter leave germany live one side border work side, vice versa.

Plus uncountable numbers roads, bridges on, especially since joined ""Schengen region"" normally border controls.

Plus whole transports goods problem.

&amp;#x200B;

""Keep out"" works much better outer borders big moat water hundreds thousands miles wide. everything either comes plane ship everybody go customs, numbers controlable. rates severe COVID death higher elderly, it‚Äôs reasonable assumption group willing vaccinated. 

I think number complicated factors. group might willing. group also least tech-savy, many processes online only. Additionally, many group may less mobile. may unable drive need assistance getting vaccination site. Although group also likely working, might flexible schedules time.

Overall, think effect complicated exactly clear. would use caution using number predict overall vaccination uptick. I'm 9 days getting first Moderna shot experiencing ""covid arm"". Itchy, red, swelling site. Yeah.

Those qualifying conditions anyone 16 AL also things like asthma (currently 10.5% pop) add things like diabetes, hypertension, obesity people, we've like week. 

We long group 1b essential workers. /shrug. alright.

I'm getting shot reasons. see misread that. always get downvotes pointing out, lockdowns effective schools shut down. hate kids try learn remotely much anyone, I'm sick pretending covid spreading schools. daily super spreader numbers show it. Media provincial government constantly tries spin otherwise inconvenient truth. used say maximum interval, saying six weeks. before, misinformation wasn‚Äôt effective. minister got confused said AZ vaccine 8% efficacy 65s, reality 8% people trial 65. 

Now make mistake downright stupid, you‚Äôre playing politics American exceptionalism much? countries lobbying international community IP current rate aren‚Äôt likely receive doses 2024. I‚Äôm sure know better do. Beyond hundreds millions human beings you‚Äôre writing protect extremely exploitive pharmaceutical industry, outlook risks health economy due potential vaccine resistant/more aggressive mutations. Lastly, take dumb fuck considering amount public money pour pharmaceutical R&amp;D gets turned around privatized expense.  Nonono, mean paper gets sent boss peer review (i.e., reviewer number 1,2, 3). Then, month review it, waits day due, sends edits.

Obviously many professors much responsible peer review, point mostly seen ""responsibility"" one wants take care task people take extremely seriously.

No one re-analyzing raw data running new stats. read hour suggest better controls experiments, look falsehoods text, etc... lot really bad research get peer-review without hitch. Sure. dying. Considering norway 1 death covid age group kinda is, yeah still low numbers! like contributing making worse. Great job. variants always thing since beginning pandemic? seems started hearing vaccine rollout began US.  Ohh whole making distinction asymptomatic presymptomatic thing infuriating, too. words interchangeable mean thing. six months 

Sadly mean precisely, please assume would last ""at least six"" data yet that. ;-) could effective 18, infinite, seven months, data far yet know. Your*

USA corruption. call lobbying. 

It's nice care much wellbeing citizens authoritarian regimes. enlightened idealogue surely paving way rest humanity prosperous peaceful future. Yeah

If I'd look Israel say ""okay, seems like 50% major plummet happens matter start loosening masking guidelines there"" actual agreement supply vaccines signed one day EU signed. 

Whether previous commitment UK AZ later sign said agreement irrelevant English law recognise agreements contract future - part earlier framework agreement would legally worth paper printed on. yeah right know nothing do, short export ban.

What done last summer, invest production facilities clear contracts gouvernment controls stuff goes. think states create sort concierge phone number elderly point. Hold hands get appointment rest us go Hunger Games websites. Wow, right, comment followed really messed That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm signing sort digital vaccine passport circumstances. Well, see, first believe ""feelings"" equal weight ""science"". pretty straightforward there... old person good immune system they're dead. It‚Äôs California. Oregon, Arizona, New Mexico, Arkansas, Oklahoma, several states seen new cases come quite bit past 2-3 weeks. Weird societies create massive inequality people ground underfoot less able worry collective problems. EU export themselves

No. could mistaken, quick search told P.1.
  I'm 30 hours post first dose Moderna, felt totally fine yesterday little arm soreness. Definitely hit today though, I've fever last hours feel reeeally tired. Kinda sucks beats getting covid.  Yup, even using modest numbers looking good. CDC also needs realistic, also say medium rare beef wear sunscreen every time leave house. live Austin, mask mandate political playtime. Nobody gives shit 6th street every night bar street. Also Travis county place Austin.

Our cases also fine locally one lowest points past year. 8 months vaccine tested MOST. Far less months testing actual people. Comparing vaccines least 5 years trials ridiculous. COVID rushed vaccine risks. Trying pretend one dishonest. Although medical peeps get it. exposure work clinical setting probably risky vaccine 2nd shot Pfizer I'm glad I'm vaccinated gotta say, vaccines go one feel great!! Zero judgement cause obviously everyone's control holy shit never occurred me. I'm tired edged Doug Ford. Give us real lockdown once! like 32 million people 16 over. count using CDC numbers, 46% currently eligible people vaccinated 39% adults. doses Pfizer. sore arm first dose. Second one less sore. Yeah

It's mess right different states saying different things CDC needs come official threshold vaccination people given state stop masking federal mandate lifted  Hey, call? I‚Äôm also trial phone number website looks like it‚Äôs tech support number? it‚Äôs important note uptick nationally, really driven increases small handful states Michigan. states seen new cases plummet recent weeks, either holding steady continue drop.

Tomorrow last round handrails. can't fucking wait. Gosh, that's heartbreaking. üò• I'm sorry. guys good access vaccines? agree. process frustrating (tears shed) I'm going drive miles home stay hotel make sure miss appointment. I'm really ashamed healthcare system handled. Way many people dead hamfisted incompetent way responded outbreak. Um, what? always count Americans right thing - they've tried everything else. 206,465 doses Canada! 

Yesterday, Canada Vaccinated 0.513% population. equivalent US vaccinating 1.69 million day. highest Thursday report record represents roughly 9% increase administration last Thursday.¬†

17.1% Canadian¬†*adults*¬†(18+) least one dose.

13.68% Canadians one dose.

Ontario (80.5%) continues vaccinate National average (79.2%) % available doses used.

Previous Federal Thursday Reports:

March 25: 190,074

March 18: 156,332

March 11: 98,028 seeing that? - first doses see PA 12th, fully vaccinated way list. I'm afraid moderna may moved work 3rd shot cover variants rather crunch numbers existing 2 shots efficacy. Unless 3rd parties conducting studies instead inaccurate.

So IFR inaccurate? skewed toward lower actually is? said absolutely accurate.  Pages point, got study today researchers didn‚Äôt find academic official reports reinfection Manaus.

They reported 3 confirmed cases reinfection.  Confirmed operative word. genetically confirmed samples (i.e. sequenced). stated report cited paper, people samples previous infections. Brazil also yet establish time two positive PCR tests used determine suspected reinfections (it's 90 days world). 3 genetically confirmed cases reinfection Manaus, likely thousands, tens thousands, suspected cases reinfection cannot genetically confirmed, like places like US. things claimed:

I saw lot claims bandied around, sure hell wasn‚Äôt scientists. Bet going used antivaxx ""only last 6 months"". definition objective inherently objective, clearly. honestly telling think Russia interfere degree US (or even greater degree) affairs countries? bad one another regard, far concerned, provide lots examples boot. I'm commenting extent EU dependent upon US (although vaccine think much otherwise things would going bit better); NATO relevant conversation military alliance, developed rival Eastern bloc originally-- nothing vaccine production/distribution generally economic concerns.

I'm skeptical Russia general rule, however would observe several items:

1. Russia country run authoritarian regime (whereas EU US democracies, matter imperfect might present). Part parcel authoritarian government comes corruption, importantly lack accountability broader population-- since genuine elections, therefore accountability voters. this, would question authoritarian country's vaccine development closely, aforementioned reasons adequate accountability ensure vaccines safe effective. 

2. second reason, related tail reason number one, two large authoritarian superpowers, China Russia, developed vaccines started role without completed phase 3 testing benchmarks, set WHO, broader scientific community. would say likely vaccines still end fine, demonstrates said above-- countries level accountability transparency citizens, would make skeptical vaccines meet level rigor broader scientific community would generally expect developing new vaccination. hospitalizations deaths decreasing, cases still increasing.

This roller-coaster. Yes stay home order lifted Toronto Peel moved lockdown it.... Agreed like get saying Fauci, doctor times also need think situation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* American trial results. JNJ 72% protective United States part trial, 58% South Africa.

AstraZeneca useless South Africa small trial there. Results bad separate project would terminated going full Phase III. fair, sub replete people attributing outright malice nationalistic motivations health agencies merely diligently job reporting findings. ""EU bad UK good"" extent commenters' decision tree. honestly disgusting watch. sub heavily brigaded Russian Chinese trolls. goal make us mad pit western world other.

Let's fall tricks. West solve problem rest world benefit. better vaccines there, like fkibg Sputnik, rather give people 40‚Ç¨/dosis vaccine asking China Russia help. Im taking Pfizer, 2 friends practically vegetative night taking it. fkibg goverment realize politics, saving people? would love see ages affected people corresponds findings Germany, Denmark Norway driver‚Äôs license another country? lockdowns work

Australian/NZ style lockdowns work, done early, outside that, look like Fast tracking term used explain completing trials concurrently within phases, rather subsequently. safety components phased testing still met. vaccines passed phased testing every vaccine market. honest BioNTech plant Marburg providing 40% doses year Pfizer. Literally generous nation history. 18.1 millon Okay let us send vaccines COVAX fair, Phizer Moderna almost identical clotting issue related catching media attention.

Any sources that? right normally 5 1 million 18.1 million people vaccinated expect normally see 90 cases Cerebral Venuous sinus thrombosis. exactly difference booster 1st/2nd shot? mean huge chunk redditors adamant fake news smear campaign EU MHRA much better quality control cases happened UK. already 5 cases known public UK. People keep shifting goal posts. 
First smear campaign political stunt. 
Then people said EU wrong national health institutes incompetent. 
Now people say cases low matter. 
Next step say ""i care sacrifice 500 perfectly healthy people get vaccines fine"" Exactly. I‚Äôm wits end. There‚Äôs outbreak extended family right they‚Äôre anti-vax anti-mask. stupidity mind boggling. sent Mexico Canada case EUA AstraZeneca weak. three vaccines currently USA market delivering millions doses per day superior product. two mRNA two shot efficacy 90s appear least somewhat protective variants. J&amp;J single shot (effective two weeks), efficacy 80s, efficacy 60s vs. South Africa.

AstraZeneca headaches double shot, efficacy low 70s USA trial, totally ineffective South African variant published research. 

An EUA supposed used when, part, availabile adequate alternatives. Well things keep changing year, basically like half student population return campus fall (IIRC) implemented way bigger testing program school. believe also using wastewater/sewage testing find hotspots spread dorms. would rollout full tests dorms classes/populations found cases. also sanction students pandemic rule violations. afraid go full-lockdown populations whole school needed. Basically took repeated recommendations ‚Äútest trace‚Äù seriously, testing contract tracing set really aggressive policies enabled end situation lot colleges past fall, didn‚Äôt enough, accountability, suddenly systems set massive outbreaks got. 

I‚Äôm sure things going thay contagious variants, heard one higherups Duke interview NPR approach freaking great see big institution trying things right (everything can, without whining money cause we‚Äôre mostly screwed recovery going COST) watching local state governments screw get blocked, also watching autonomous institutions like schools, big companies, etc take accountability make effort people inside them. That's immensely sensible way it, hope states / federal guidance follow suit. NC cases rising bit moot point moment, think everyone would feel better sort defined goal aim for. Page 48 realize US gets 1 million doses factories EU right ? think US saying fuckup J&amp;J factory Baltimore affecting them? affecting get J&amp;J shots EU. they're near cleveland, Wolstein center CSU used mass vac site, starting week every college campus well. Along nearly every store pharmacy. local paper mentioned phone app called armorvax used sign one college locations. Wow, conspiracy non-profit vaccine involves: 

* EU

* US

* Australia, Canada, Norway

* UK seeing 2 link. saying wrong. may missing something. America power share wealth( Vaccine counts) Greed dangerous dude ask Ebenezer Scrooge Grinch live Michigan, northern ohio lots open walk vaccines available. Whatever

U continue support Trump watch Fox news u want. months enough people vaccinated stupid comments actions despicable covid spreader even relevant anymore I'm gonna lie; totally jealous Americans right now. Would love normal summer ahead (*cries Europe*). price paid heavy price. fact heaviest price nation possibly pay almost 600k dead. 

Canada's gonna longer haul, important remember saved quite lives much superior handling pandemic (although share bumps). There's something said actually get see loved ones live rest lives, versus many south never get see lives ones again. 

However nothing beat US comes handling vaccination program. Unreal watch unfold real time never wildest dreams think would grand. Glad get happy ending covid storyline! get coming woulda kinds fucked say priority would given people refusing take precautions making people taking precautions wait.

Not saying variant dangerous, that's reason troubles there. forbidding entire block people live state getting vaccinated seems like bad idea. making travel parts country shot recipe viral spread.

This seems like bad policy one could much harm. surprise all.

Here Norway experts concluded weeks ago vaccine cause blood clots. agree rule always ask people confuse correlation causation. robot always automatically assumes happened. case, happened.

The link Norwegian, chief physician professor, P√•l Andre Holme , led group looking says, unconditionally, ""We know cause. nothing else vaccine explain immune reaction"".

The cases involved symptoms never seen before, anyone. seriously weakens argument/question: ""this happens sometimes anyway, know happened anyway?"" symptoms seen multiple patients received vaccine.

Second, multiple alternatives. convinced AstraZeneca equally good others. Given this, would young woman choose AstraZeneca options?

Reading lines news stories press releases, seeing lot people concerned public health large, vaccine skepticism etc. ""colors"" opinions issue. concerned optics talking lethal side effects vaccine midst pandemic. convinced AstraZeneca vaccine help fighting pandemic . good thing injected.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!! Norway calculating risks this, quite possibly among certain groups vaccine *slightly* lethal virus.

As vaccines available, might beneficial Norway restrict AZ vaccine certain groups. alternative - would completely different picture.

All want personally another month caution people keep interpreting saying I'm scared shitless want cases 0. Sure, strategy work people right return overseas home. figure full year pandemic, people still abroad right reside there, every immigration case certainly varies based individual situation.

3) feel like action necessarily problematic problem actions. politicians follow popular opinion, feel like words like ""we get you"" seems reinforce sense American exceptionalism others depend benevolence US rather seeing trade humanitarian relief mutual understanding equals. also feel like American exceptionalism leads e.g. indifference towards humanitarian crisis Yemen caused Saudi intervention US arms. long American public completely indifferent human rights outside borders, nothing change. EU domestic production, Netherlands alone AstraZeneca factory, much dependent US vaccines, feel like travesty US letting Canadians Mexicans die refuse give doses (and doses sent them, sent AZ get FDA approval). Despite Mexico Canada long-standing US trading partners Canada also major military intelligence partner. naive you? Biden per say, it‚Äôs democrat political operatives (chief staff, et al).

When take states high native populations, vast majority states getting per capita allocation states. basically go right list. 

Someone making decision states get states get less, it‚Äôs certainly equal per capita. Political graft favors tale old time. think flu once,‚Äù said Lori Mansour, 67, lives near Rockford, Illinois. ‚ÄúSo think I‚Äôll take chances.‚Äù

People like never cease amaze me. dude, UK still EU member started vaccination made arrangements it. lift private requirements.

No, private requirements based CDC guidelines lifted. something know firsthand partner, works school district, happy head spring break without putting job risk. "" Dr. Anthony Fauci, Biden administration's chief medical adviser, predicts U.S. see fourth wave coronavirus **as severe previous three**, thanks uptick vaccinations.

Glad can‚Äôt outsourced get vaccination threshold high enough, nothing flu majority population. Vaccinations prevent severe disease vastly prevent asymptomatic transmission. bar-b-q

This bugging hell lmao  Distributing making fake ids illegal possessing single fake presume. avoid superlatives messaging. 

FFS, almost nothing gets past peer review unfounded superlatives, suddenly comes public messaging superlatives okay? disagree completely. third time Fauci underestimated vast stupidity average American. Oh, we're gonna play bad faith question game? Aight.

Tell willing bend let corporations government take civil liberties away ""uWu pandemic means every right thrown window SaFeTy"" !RemindMe 3 Months Thank much! good averages. You‚Äôre mileage may vary. Ôøº Great. actually able travel countries? I‚Äôm hoping able go Europe Asia end summer. Yeah, observing public health recommendations that.

Vaccinating differently one racist, disgusting things pandemic. Second people's treatment Asians. crazy. remember taught vaccines work 7th grade science class. education system US failed many. Watch Republicans trying prove Fauci wrong. Source? Because, saw MEDIA reporting that, saw actual CDC guidance saying essentially Fauci saying. Pretty much media took headline ran instead reading whole guidance. Yeah think it‚Äôs review process requirements study participants etc, entities aside CDC getting authorization. love 2-3 main talking points too. ‚ÄúAlters DNA, soon know, effective transmission‚Äù. I‚Äôm like damn y‚Äôall good marketing there. Social media doesn‚Äôt help.  Preliminary studies show vaccine anywhere 10%-70% effective variants depending vaccine maker brazil south african variants south african variants greatest risk. minor symptoms wife vaccinated breastfeeding doctor fine it. well baby. first paragraph reasonable opinion. sure agree it‚Äôs reasonable. 

Your second paragraph unreasonable. don‚Äôt need measles vaccine passport herd immunity measles excellent uptake vaccine. get covid, true covid vaccine passports. measles vaccine uptake falls dramatically starts killing hundreds thousands Americans, we‚Äôll different conversation. Longer term...find new job. Nobody deserves work someone like that. attainable, attainable while. would taken people mindful, would take people mindful.

It's likely, people mindful. *Osterholm agree that* impersonal risk, SARS-COV-2 grow trees!! 24 cases, 0 deaths Pfizer ~11m doses. 30 cases, 4 deaths 18m doses AZ. Fauci said worry new surge. feel like he‚Äôs said nothing doom gloom year I‚Äôm taking huge reason hopeful. It‚Äôs though... vaccines work population efficacy based many people vaccinated. Dipshits choosing get vaccinated making decision themselves. though.  Please correct I'm wrong event 14 days set stone. That's tested people agreed antibody leveled ""acceptable"". I've seen studies saying 7-10days. never exact science everyone Handel vaccine differently.  so, saying that, making guidance. particular report based actual infections, antibody counts. However many studies look antibodies incomplete. reinterpretation:

Texas Governor: Fuck yeah!!! masks!!! fact see problem motivates escape western society. disgusting. One colleagues came home Colombia that. really doses vaccinate citizens, let alone foreigners. Maybe State Dept send JJ doses embassies seeing easier transport. mean point hyper-targeting puts lot logistical strain effort. Shots arms asap ought goal. example, FDA usually takes many years, decades even, vaccine development approval process. reason shots going arms today 1) lot work actually done advance scientists thinking ahead next pandemic nobody radars; 2) Emergency Use Authorization.

The pace identification virus IND filing impressively fast, spurred developments made SARS1 MERS CoVs, especially stabilized spike proteins mRNA process. However, fast time, part usually take whole lot longer year two.

However, missing important part speed IND filing Phase 3 readout, part takes several years: number infections community. vaccines spend ages phase 3 waiting enough infections reach appropriate statistical power. COVID ripping population barely wait 5 months get there.

Even without EUA process, would getting pfizer vaccine months, planning file BLA shortly. UK variant zero observed effect vaccine‚Äôs efficacy. SA variant proven still neutralized vaccine, slightly lower effectiveness. Split difference still end 80% observed protection 14 days. It‚Äôs anti-mask/van crowd though. There‚Äôs people thread using data early December try discredit data studies done Israel March. It‚Äôs 2-year study. Wait. What?!? saying two weeks second shot might 55% protected? 10 mil doses age group. even thoses people needed Pfizer second dose AZ could still use 20 mil AZ jabs next quarter. recieve 17 mil. again: doses distributed equally around europe numbers germany applied, least approximatly, countries. already shittier.

""Epidemiologists"".

So far, many things would seem extremely complicated medical ""professionals"" 2020 2021.

Just ""science"" slapped everything mean actually true science.

We don‚Äôt need measles vaccine passport enough people taken vaccine. enough people take covid vaccine, passport usage short lived. Ty info. I'm curious many people trials prior yourself, guess sample size didnt start getting really big til late year. vaccinated go fully normal.

Source? stated public health officials I've seen, anywhere, I'm curious people getting idea. Strict podding would nice fantasy world. think educators uproar year? safety measures fantasy, enforcing them, even so. I‚Äôm glad kids great wearing masks... Thats deep chaos, 4000 deaths day people dying without medical care. several cities vaccination suspended vaccines. duration.... 2nd shot probably helps increasing duration immunity yay trial SA UK variants prevalent. guys ahead us vaccinations.

Insanity.  Getting thing now, right vaccine, would pretty bad though. mean, even going enough vents available need it, still terrible experience have. I‚Äôd wait another weeks skip mess. comes US, lower expectations extremely unlikely spread it. Even first dosage cut transmissions significantly, second non existent. believe point pandemic, people smart enough calculate risks somewhat accurately. Congratulations info missing.

We need know ages people adverse effects well number vaccines given age group. 

If vaccinated 20 million people 65 adverse reaction, make sense include evaluate risk people 65. issue affecting people 65. think point guidance, situation naturally improve substantially point. 

I don‚Äôt think get rid mask mandates number follow. think essence full agreement. Even requiring schools overreach fully approved FDA. still spread people though. 7 days second does, basically can't spread covid all. There's 6 week overlap getting vaccine full strength immunity. nobody ever going tell take mask immediately after. No, would perfect example last year Yeah announced today pfizer vaccinated concert-goers reason care. think perspective concert venue. care whether unvaccinated people attend concert, spread among concert health department going allow concerts. (Very simplified.) nice adults charge again. Unfortunately look Israel‚Äôs vaccination, they‚Äôve exponentially slowed. may reach numbers herd immunity. likely us next. Reason lot people don‚Äôt want likely sign pharmacy. correct sense every time uttered, save lives. time, would final 40-60 days find today! worst part: People lose confidence, become hesitant, either take vaccine, procrastinate, delay it.

Even mixing vaccines perfectly safe, people going concerned, act according gut judgment trust destroyed. hope gets better. anyone who's curious:

Falsely attributed churchill get picky CDC ""permitting"" anything set rules. Unfortunately statements characteristically guarded hedged little hard ‚ÄúI would advocate general travel overall. guidance silent recommending recommending fully vaccinated people travel. guidance speaks safety so.‚Äù

They drive little nuts this... saying something without saying something.

All said, wife vaccinated going travel lot more, teenage kids vaccinated, we're going travel like normal. country country, cases decline vaccination campaigns begin.

Not argue crazies... Plenty countries middle surge. Ontario gone back lockdown 10% first shot vaccination. too! Public mandates / guidance public behavior two different things. States big things similarly, differences public behavior say California Florida great. 

I think guy pretty spot thing tough 18 million - following data continent primarily among younger specifically women. might bad 1 60.000 among younger women, higher risk corona.

Lets see looks like AZ dead least younger women Europe (there might something genetical cant generalize globally) unless high level infection. 

PS specific form cloth - blood cloths general. Hating country Israel antisemitic hating CCP.   potential vaccine passport somehow invasive regular passport travel visa.

It *is* invasive, applies everyday domestic activities never required permission before. See: New York's [Excelsior Different areas government differing roles responsibilities. CDC run scientists. want politicians influencing policy recommendations. White House hand priorities go beyond scope CDC. policies based reported CDC, erring side caution. authoritarian system messaging 100% consistent across board. hate Trump, simple that. hate cult personality around Trump deeply guilty weakness, begging cult personality own. DOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!!!!

You seem addicted bad news, even make yourself. prefer wait 90- 95%. haven‚Äôt gotten far don‚Äôt want mess now. Especially father law died with-in last 3 weeks family friend got first shot 3 days later hospital died. contracted virus 2 days first shot sad. Advice specifically take nsaids vaccination. justifying stupidity mistake. I'm Boston Maine definitely go fuck themselves. Yeah ""end"" pegged Memorial Day even though WH said July 4th. vaccination rates warm weather north getting people outside help limit spread see timeline getting moved up. Fauci says 10k cases day less he's OK ending restrictions. We've jumped bit 80k recent surge vaccinations lined next 2 month decline quickly.

I say ""end"" may see flare ups winter risk variant causing chaos. may last years even. far average person goes it'll summer almost certainly. Maybe. Seems like something would difficult determine without using spreadsheet good inputs. vaccinating 7 billion people take lot injectors dubious rich countries flying tens (hundreds?) thousands people months (years?) end get done. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôd actually need card, risk infection low. United States risk people good 4 months get vaccinated. Vaccination rates climbing, believe yesterday 3 million. It‚Äôs stupid require it‚Äôll easy fake. Still tossed year life trash. waste. norovirus 3 weeks ago. Damn kids really. I'm US citizen Canada might able shed light. Canada's problem two fold....It bought one every virus enough cover population intention giving poorer countries. meant go heavily first ones available initially orders.

The second problem due larger political battle care get previous administration less abandoned capability produce develop vaccines within Canada (which particularly odd Canadian institution developed first commercial insulin) can't snap fingers procure resources manpower develop vaccine going change year. case meant many Canadian orders vaccines came US production facilities, currently prohibited export vaccines via executive order POTUS, significantly hampered Canadian supply. vaccinated risk, risk incredibly small. human thing, American thing. cultures simply better hiding massive media infrastructure paying attention issues. help explain.

I trust EUA process trust Approval process.

If high risk situation (doctor, teacher, etc,), would take vaccine based EUA. would emergency determined risk unapproved vaccine outweigh situation.

However, EUAs apply people low risk. I'm low risk therefore require Approval able lower risk vaccine match normal risk condition.

Analogy: dying cancer, use unapproved procedure maybe save one's life. apply procedure someone that's dying cancer, risk unapproved procedure outweighs normal conditions. Yeah? So? It‚Äôs still 77 million Western country. 
You want EU net exporter something? American society reward unselfishness equitable fair. rewards competition. course people jump line. Unselfish people get left behind either complain forum jump line yourself. there's still fucking pandemic really slowing, 16% country vaccinated. Precautions taken... Lots people doubted predicted exactly right. Vaccine Experience:

1st dose, side effects except super sore arm like 2-3 days site location. Maybeee tiny almost noticeable headache like 10 seconds lol.

2nd dose, nothing. even sore arm.

Is odd? mean like, literally felt like nothing happened second one. Worried dose actually get injected. 

&amp;#x200B;

How arm feel second one? [**This guideline essential still avoid travel entirely possible. 2 weeks ago Norovirus. brutal. individual venue wants say ""To attend concert must negative test 24 hours proof vaccination"" issues that.


That's.... literally whole point ""passport."" would difficult forge version current vaccine cards airlines, concert venues, etc, could verify vaccinated.

No one's suggesting go back old days smallpox vaccines non-optional roving bands vaccine squads would tackle, beat, vaccinate people streets. do. patience eliminate risk. suck? Absolutely. that's life. AZ procurement production went well UK

Except fact AZ way behind deliveries well. Lol point clear get go, unless NPC critical thinking skill know. Thank God fasttracked vaccine vaccinating million day Biden took over. 3.975m actually! close 4m. (At least CDCs website) pretty active, went gym 2 hours shot kept active, next morning felt nothing all. reason would check asymptomatic patients?

Asymptomatic individuals still transmit virus.  Next month Fauci say ‚Äúit common sense expect 4th wave‚Äù Looks like there‚Äôs way Israeli defenders thing else. Heaven forbid people bring anything negative. Maybe big one, data already showing 4th wave. Hell, I'm ages category it'll end week me! EMA exactly covered glory expeditious decision making far.

The data everyone see. summarized responses explained answer question. 

But again, think even asking vaccines approved.

So I'm content leaving point, thread speaks itself. Thanks trying answer question. learned one thing today, apparently Pfizer asking FDA approval expensive time consuming. He's earning name ""Dr-Ding Dong."" completely irrational. actually broke GF month first restrictions started FL. May stayed known craziness horizon. Something hindsight 20/20?

And pretty burnt mentally. I‚Äôll starting new university summer hopefully change scenery lift spirits. jinx it!! ü§û one take side-effects? Say me: Normal Summer!

Here's hoping weeks hit magic 50% number cases start die like Israel things coast easily herd immunity reached. title post matches title linked article wrong. doses administered Thursday. doses reported administered, actual administration doses largely previous 1-4 days, even back that.

The article quotes tweet words correctly: set incredible all-time record +3.975M doses reported administered

Which great, actually administering doses single day. largest single day currently data 3.4M+ doses administered March 25th (data March 29th - April 1st still incomplete). 

For breakdown doses day Gottlieb best widely followed voice medical community pandemic. Takes seriously, treats us like adults fear monger. CA it‚Äôs basically now. Saw Kong vs Godzilla midnight premiere seeing ball game brother weekend. Following mandates long they‚Äôre necessary, pretty much everyone personally know vaccinated now, crushing days. Nice! called see they‚Äôll say didn‚Äôt connect site coordinator. 

That‚Äôs interesting, didn‚Äôt even think needing show proof vaccinated deal vaccine approved US. really hope don‚Äôt end either - would hassle try get approved one we‚Äôre already vaccinated. able done quickly, would emergency use authorization prevent slow it? think read article Pfizer eligible full authorization now. Honest question...I really idea process authorizing drugs. know federal employee, ungodly slow inefficient US government is. local Rite Aid wait list extra/standby doses. go person fill form. got list last Wednesday called today saying extra dose. Philadelphia. 

I think company-wide policy, couple locations asked said stand list. I'm happy system place! going ignore question lecture continue call names? Man, desperate bad news! Damn, lucky. hope birthday next year, too! /s reason be. That's entire point vaccine. Ok see Consider Netherlands rising cases past 8 weeks, currently hanging around 7,500 cases per day, would 150,000 per day US. deaths dropping past 3 months, still dropping, currently sitting 24 deaths per day average, would 480 deaths per day average US, lows 10 deaths day, around 200 deaths US. vaccinated around 11% first dose.

The US, 66,000 cases average per day currently, rising. Also, around 980 deaths average per day currently, stable. US vaccinated around 30% population first dose.

So difference interesting. Netherlands 2,5 times cases compared US (keep mind Netherlands test lot, 8.5% positivity) vaccinated one third US has, half deaths still dropping (keep mind Netherlands lower overall mortality expected past 4/5 weeks) US dropping anymore.

So much enough? Around 1,000 deaths per day average certainly still way high, considering vaccinations cases. Especially considering figures Netherlands. least half deaths enough, would say. hard argue decision looking numbers.

The EMA makes argument, still believe benefits outweigh risks groups. many regulators around world, including UK's MHRA.

I'm going say whether Germany making correct decision not, place, situation definitely certain. Perhaps places. significant percentage Americans made clear intend get vaccine. expect immunity actual infections get us herd immunity level regions summer. ""Somos el primer pa√≠s de Chile"" People buying these? card looks unofficial could made construction paper crayon. (Don't people) Mate, I've spent past year day drinking working home. I'm ready this! Pfizer - Fox 
Moderna - Falco 
J&amp;J - Marth 
AZ - Pichu 


Sorry, sorry. LOL, absolute balls Feigl Ding freely acknowledge vaccines block transmission 94%, that‚Äôs still good enough locked zero COVID achieved.

Holy crap. point still right. doctor still saying point literally never going approve anything 6 months rest planet lol. It‚Äôs safe go movies situation, doctor care fun, don‚Äôt want get sued, going give approval reason. believe pharmacist administered mine said full effects antibodies takes 9-10 days first shot, see CDC site. seen?  Yes is. can‚Äôt spread something don‚Äôt have. Great hear! Yeah called morning, couldn‚Äôt connect site coordinator. We‚Äôll see goes. Thank you. Honestly, I'm happy people see way. Objectively speaking, completely agree, personal level, know I'm still happy received Pfizer---as much recognize could result problem national level. I'm talking infections.  I'm talking people still vaccinated spreading disease.  thing. Whatever need tell yourself, chief. Man like maybe week two ago excited see us close clearing 3 million day. almost 4! hope trend keeps up. hope not. thought still first. Doesn‚Äôt spread air systems indoors? Without context, sure. ""once millenia pandemic"", event covid IMO really lived expectations, great :D I'll say outset I'm vaccine passports. think actually drive vaccine hesitancy. think we'll get better uptake overall system simply gives people positive incentives vaccinated, lots resources educate it.

Another aspect debate find confusing people apparently want vaccine passports covid. Many diseases vaccines (ie measles) much deadly, potential kill children. Also, vaccines fully approved virtually every country, almost ubiquitously available. think want roll vaccine passports, start one deadly diseases already achieved herd immunity. LOL. Sweet naive soul. Hey I‚Äôm it, go ways. Especially effectiveness mRNA vaccines, generally available that‚Äôs good it‚Äôs going get. good. 
It bothers see people upvote obviously inaccurate information.

Carry on. wrong think prefer now? feel like I'm ready see people's faces somehow. whole thing messed up, think. ‚ÄúResults showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination. Following single dose either vaccine, participants‚Äô risk infection SARS-CoV-2 reduced 80 percent two weeks vaccination.‚Äù  
This includes asymptomatic carriers well worked one, sometimes! would probably characterize unclear unproven, rather outright wrong. really know hit nail head, you‚Äôre right. didn‚Äôt prioritize college teachers staff matter strategy. yes, students biggest spreaders. Wouldn‚Äôt mean faculty staff ought prioritized? People genuinely believe people *desire* lockdowns restrictions last longer minds. sure but, consider 16% US vaccinated, give pause. we're free clear. Hawaii listenin‚Äô? deductible zero diagnostic testing (any lab tests) except mri ct scans free. Again..the top 20% 9&amp; workers benefit heavily america people great america. A. immunity something, next occurrence something *less* symptomatic more.. 

B. symptomatic, good sign: might going kind immune-system overreaction.
Which BAD thing (hint: immune system overreaction one ways Covid19 kills, lookup ""cytokine storms"")

C. finally, 2nd time worse first, 3rd? expect fourth wave, filling morgues rate last one. lasting damage followed orders closely. happening children crazy. fortunate able work office 50% time whole duration pandemic, real socialization coworkers, mental health WFH co-workers hurting. One guy prescribed drugs strong sometimes trouble standing could fall asleep work, others going crazy children living small flat.
The groundhog day effect WFH real.
I think stopped following travel recommendations bit later, probably August, slowly adjust use masks less less since months back never stopped seeing friends, found GF lockdown that's great mental support also. Mental health issues stemming lockdowns far dangerous covid itself. would sitting right next unvaccinated, symptomatic person covid talking directly whole movie almost chance getting it. population numbers basing percentages on?  severe previous three probably cycle we've seen around world.

Cases spike, governments impose restrictions people voluntarily reduce activity self-preservation. Cases fall.

Cases fall, governments reduce restrictions people increase activity less scared previous spike. Cases spike again.

Repeat get vaccine. people *paying* $150.00 fake vaccine card. Like, wtf? vaccine card free lol.

Also, learned having/making cards federal offense use government logo/seal. Soooooo.....it worth haha. completed? OK....and results? taking official US government study, Fauci saying days ago one necessary. saying this? DC Walgreen's corona vaccine appointment website anyone else? I'm trying make appointment errors every time get stage tells stores availability. AZ mostly imported Miami ranked higher every category definitely harder get OU. I'll taking day post 2nd moderna forgive wanting restaurants massless licking silverware toilets cleaned.

Do typically clean toilet restaurant? J&amp;J flew home state first time nearly 2 years3 weeks getting shot. single widow mother got second pfizer shot recently.

Yes, masking entire time (k95 too) airports, ubers everyone around me, regrets remained entirely asymptomatic 4 weeks far. still going see large crowds people enclosed settings bit, I'm lot outdoor activities gradually adjusting back normal life again. plan close normal summer/fall can.

I full confidence route thing everything help around find shot appointments too. saying...

Overconfidence sarcasm protect you. Ignore facts paying price, yet again. time, self righteous think enlightened overestimate current position virus suffer. took roommate's mother vaccine site Wednesday, guess extra due expire offered 30 year old shoulder shot turn down. think I've said, ""Yes,"" quickly asked wanted one.

I've encouraged friends call ahead see pharmacies nearby extra doses day unscheduled. walk though (or maybe walk asking extra day). Six already gotten since then. guess 10% useless yesterday feel great today. felt extra great Wednesday though knowing got first shot.

Anyway, I'm getting agree. go ahead get younger ones vaccinated extra doses would've thrown (unless states already okayed shots), may end tail end thing soon. never ""no"" risk. almost aspect life. messaging 2 months [**2021-06-02 18:44:33 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-06-02%2018:44:33%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

And, fair, reasonable place public health agency exist. ""You made typo, therefore win. intelligent ü§ì"" one expects spanish inquisition, mean fourth wave... I'm comfortable bong hits covid sputem point told asking, ""why vaccines approved,"" would saved us lot time.

I think asking, ""why vaccines approved."" Problem gain knowledge person thinks asking question.

Ugh, told beginning. cool, whole lot cooler others group. thanks discussion. seems we've reached end since know us still know COVID vaccines FDA Approved.  20% increase huge.  got vaccinated little two weeks ago, don‚Äôt *want* spend day bed feel gross more, it‚Äôs prospect I‚Äôm really worried about, even count ‚Äúgetting sick.‚Äù

A month ago, permanent lung damage loss one senses real possibility. Nope, I'm vaccinated longer masked Well, guess can‚Äôt say vaccinated people protected covid either, since isn‚Äôt 100 percent.

then years now. end study 2023?  actual source, also something learned college class specifically labor US   dunno I‚Äôd call ‚Äúoutside box.‚Äù DeWine excluded higher ed faculty staff priority groups vaccinated, despite including K-12. makes big fucking deal vaccinating *students*? Yet another big fucking middle finger state colleges.  interesting wish source would gone depth far naming particular vaccines. signed vaccine choice j&amp;j Pfizer. ended choosing Pfizer it‚Äôs effective part wonders j&amp;j better suited demographic (healthy 30 year old). read programs targeting demographics like homeless transient one dose vaccine don‚Äôt worry getting people back 2nd dose. eligibility expanding US wonder groups like college students eventually younger kids targeted one dose vaccines similar reasons. deaths time attributed vaccine expected deaths large population.   You‚Äôre actually making right questions.

13 million Pfizer doses 15.8 million AZ, March 21st Well, guess can‚Äôt say vaccinated people protected covid either, since isn‚Äôt 100 percent. 

A lot talking points scientists going change then. 

Hopefully change won‚Äôt keep people getting vaccinated. Part US covers large variety climates large number travel destinations within states, need leave country unless either want to, work.

We also used need passport go Canada.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* causal relationship first statement, can't compare incidences vaccines sampling difference significant. group receiving AZ group receiving Pfizer comparable. I‚Äôve read EUA multiple times. 4 cases mild COVID trial (1 vaccine group, 3 placebo group). Moderate captured almost symptomatic COVID. WTAF? Whose dumbshit idea that? think theory entirely plausible. many states young people going gradually getting infected last year. Michigan they're going first time now. Compounded fact young people vaccinated, happens. Wow must think rest us super impressed west coast. never heard Dartmouth? friggin ivy gods sake. many people vaccinated AZN UK compared Pfizer?

I'm trying difficult, suggest saying incorrect. believe link cases AZN vaccine. also think critical transparent data posted here. cannot say 4 fatalities resulted vaccine itself. know Betteridge's Law Headlines universal ""this always true"" thing, right? pfzier moderna choice, unless wants 1 shot J&amp;J seems like people already covid report intense side effects shots. makes sense immune systems would already familiar spike protein. correct, point getting vaccine already got virus, mechanism immunity functionally same. grandparents vaccinated covid me. reason social distance grandparents vaccinated. Nobody dies humans die drowning.

Thus use ""don't"" correct. Also old story, current information said Maddow Show. wonder 2nd doses affect data. think means matched individuals discharged hospital similar people NHS database decision similar based information available database went back 10 years. comparisons rates readmission death based time period. tens millions, dying issue concern, publicised across Europe, shortly receiving vaccine.

It really doesn‚Äôt need harder sending email. Actually no. Financial aid states, FEMA sites, well use military personnel mass vaccination sites crucial speed roll out. Let abundantly clear.

The MHRA reported **up March 21st** 24 cases CVST causing 4 fatalities detected people vaccine (interval unknown).

This compares zero cases Pfizer. Walmart worked me. also site guy made bit sketch find available vaccine place go major providers website sign safe: stupid becomes lucrative stupid lose identities get fined imprisoned. belong shady ""Fake"" vaccine get places get vaccine passport near future, risking everyone encounter. also assault like someone HIV injecting someone AIDs thing virus. Usually, we‚Äôve warm, sunny March year. think said 8th warmest March record. Anything admit maybe, maybe, lockdown restrictions US haven‚Äôt effective.. Though worth point definitive causal relationship vaccine, lower incidence number seen UK (just 1 1000000) remain noisy require refinement. 

You pull data support view shaky armchair analysis, MHRA PRAC view AZ pose enough risks pulled use. opinions ones matter. Statement cases presenting cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral vein thrombosis disseminated intravascular coagulation; currently 
insufficient evidence establish definitive causal relationship vaccine; cases mainly occurred i.e. women &lt; 55 Statement benefit/risk individuals increased risk thromboembolic events (including autoimmune disease, oral contraceptive use, prior history thromboembolic 
events) evaluated vaccination.

PRAC also stated observation needs monitoring risk analysis used may fully appropriate, data

1. Importance ruling COVID-19 disease alternative diagnosis cases reported thrombotic events may presenting feature COVID-19; 
2. exploration case definitions interest continued monitoring expert review;
3. refinement observed expected analsyis level background rates exposure e.g. age-group, including sensitivity analysis. note also rates

You‚Äôre missing one key point add: US lockdowns aren‚Äôt effective said ""baseless"" shot comment, general comment people stating arguable things facts without listing sources.

There comments yesterday left lots upvotes someone disputed comments upvotes still top first thing getting read.

Sorry take comment, general comment two people stating things fact clue correct. someone participated clinical trials AZ vaccine, I‚Äôve long thought soon J&amp;J got approved. AZ trials taking long knew inevitably going happen. 

My biggest concern I‚Äôm still ‚Äòblinded‚Äô study, don‚Äôt know received vaccine not, vaccines available people CA, I‚Äôm hoping get unblinded soon! 

They weren‚Äôt going unblind us AZ got approved eligible already approved vaccine. money AZ approved first, quickly went away üò¨ produced Fo sho! actually read pandemic response plan trump tossed out? Lol goes everything you‚Äôre saying, even advocating widespread lockdowns. It‚Äôs useful plan, tbh louisiana hasn‚Äôt fucked up. I‚Äôm 30, get second shot Monday. Almsot everyone know wants get least gotten one shot dad going getting first dose soon may choice vaccine get. latest info have, vaccine choose? matter? US need vaccines covid decades - seems stupid damaging approve it, WHO, EMA MHRA (along 100 regulators done). Peru deaths per capita Latin Am√©ricans right behind. Brazil ugly duck, but, 2 months now, curve go neighbor new duck. Anyone think recent surges Michigan Massachusetts due fact strict lockdowns US they‚Äôre opening up, suffering lack natural immunity? I‚Äôm saying Texas Florida states poor Covid rules right. It‚Äôs interesting. California major fraud FDA approve AstraZeneca vaccine, probably vaccine. Plenty countries world look US FDA standard setter.

Do they? 100+ countries using look effective has/will country make decision. FDA anomaly  21 days norm lowest employees Netherlands. University workers take 40 days. Sick days course another matter. side effect, woke 1 couldn‚Äôt bend knee hurt bad, locked place minutes. Went back bed good morning. guess cell phone. ""I'm aware trial count.""

... ask data, blindly assert existing data ""doesn't count""? ones Germany given 60, 3 million number needs compared assess rate similar two countries, full 18 million. So, partially vaccinated? One pfizer/moderna? Mind ask fine one, two? It‚Äôs literally googling - covid vaccine Ohio. retail pharmacy grocery store pharmacy handing out. Huh? variant exact hospitalization death rate, it‚Äôs spreading quickly. Stop spreading misinformation I'm thankful UK left vaccines experts. Lay people trying justify certain vaccines better others never ceases amaze Research data show steady increase protection 12 days, perhaps earlier take incubation period account, see graph 

Interestingly, real world data quite different. Israel's data found almost protection 2 weeks, around 90% protection 3 weeks. ""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off.** cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection."" likely explanation gap: trial volunteers told, behaved exactly get vaccine, saw steady rise protection. real life vaccine recipients dropped precautions soon, saw increase infections day 0 - 8, day 8-14 vaccine risky behaviors cancelled (resulting zero effect), 21 days vaccine won. Yes wildly different. That‚Äôs shutdown. vaccines causing 60-95% effectiveness reducing severe symptoms shown stop spread infection.

Society fine 60mil infected, 50k die year flu. vaccines help us get numbers. it‚Äôs going away. You‚Äôll learn ‚Äúlive it‚Äù. It‚Äôs going ‚Äú0‚Äù. get $100 bonus getting shot get paid time get it. America.

I think case standard Flint Detroit. Literally public pharmacy worth checking out, well state site county health boards. wife able book less 10 appointments I, family, friends able find themselves, without utilizing two lottery picks county health board. ended getting shot Giant Eagle pharmacy, could try Walmart, CVS, Sam's Club, Kroger, Meijer, Walgreen's, Target, Rite-Aid.

If anywhere near Cleveland, FEMA's clinic Wolstein Center reliable way getting vaccines - I've found effective call (833-427-5634) use site get appointment.

Also, signing MyChart opens opportunities vaccine scheduling well - understanding necessarily need part system health provider / PCP uses system beforehand sign use vaccine seeking. talking German doctors paper either way never ever say certain cause like early stages, it‚Äôs really terrible scientific communication; truly abhorrent behaviour scientist hung dry saying think things people understand numbers meant meaning epidemic/pandemic, personal health. 

Deaths supposed deaths disease, people disease dead, assuming dead bodies spread, -1 spreaders virus, someone ""recovering"" (getting rid virus) -1 active infected patient. 

The active cases traced total cases - deaths - recoveries. active cases go 0 raise, virus fully stopped course. 

As far numbers ""care"", someone anymore infective die right away, *recovered*. 

A similar discussion could made *mild* patients. *Mild* means go hospital occupy/use health resources, mean mild getting cold. sick 20-30 days, getting pneumonia, etc., recover considered ""mild"". 

I know long covid exaggerated around, say yes, say no. either way, epidemiological numbers really deeply care French government care.

But French doctors do. take up- downvotes seriously.

I've read dumb questions, dumb answers.

I also understand Corona virus simpler Flu virus probably mutate much. even think places mutate something effective already shown. true, would think yearly altered vaccine Corona less needed Flu, Corona change much.

Of course factors: maybe vaccine works x time need get new one, people taken vaccine yet.

Also already working combinations vaccines (1 shot flu corona). pill spray (at least nanobodies, medicine) instead syringe.

And gained knowledge could also new, better flu vaccines help longer current ones (maybe even vaccines agains AIDS cancers). also wonder effect current low spread flu (due lockdowns) need new flu vaccine next years. Parently people like facts simple reality subreddit anymore...This proven true... experience went get vision test could get week even day. month later already asked previously appointment. Africans Sirians do. Probably easier staying sinking US. younger 30? Start work&amp;travel visas. Foreing hiring (Netherlands, Ireland, etc). Every fucking detail process filed regulators. shocked.

That's I'm referring to. amount population involved supporting critical infrastructure tiny compared kept going work service jobs. Please research Chile seeing rise cases leave sinophobia one side That‚Äôs really true. Covid different flu vaccine totally forgot spring break. would good target. real wrong declaration AZ coming EU leader. even EU leader strict sense word, leader individual country. one-off, never said again. still, reading subreddit one would think every EU leader lambasting AZ efficiency time. Exactly this. might run citizens willing get vaccinated US, countries would kill get hands one effective vaccines market. ramping production however can. Um, kind probe laying laptop, using???  
Certainly look suitable nose... studies performed test tube culture dish?

&amp;#x200B;

ü§£ helpful shortage actual physical vials?

There massive shortage vials across industry, supply inelastic difficult ramp. So, yes.

Also, filling capacity production bottleneck, increase existing filling capacity 50% immediately. well sourced apparently actual vaccine difficult expensive produce since individual person needs small amount what's difficult storage, transportation, someone qualified administer vaccine, making sure person supplies need, etc (of course actually developing getting approved difficult expensive). 

the article even regulator also warned without proper syringes needles may possible extract 13 doses Moderna‚Äôs 15 dose vials, 10 doses current vials.

also, never administered injection, come special vials wipe vial alcohol wipe, stab syringe plastic piece, pull syringe out, plastic forms seal next stabbing. can't like use cocacola bottles something. title article specifies one dose vaccine. true all. I‚Äôve trying weeks. time workers usually get 40 hours year paid vacation use whatever reason 40 hours medical leave used medical reasons.

That's two weeks. hell. Two measly five day weeks. one vacation? shithole. know many take even that.

Temporary workers live get (10% working hours vacations course long weeks medical reasons, sick, choice). general anxiety disorder catching Covid always anxiety provoking masks.. wild different things affect people. problem AZ normal blood clots. much rarer form blood clot.
Its real possibility AZ direct correlation deadly blood clots could mortality rate higher Coronavirus 55 women birth control (or not).
I got AZ vaccine today, im man im bit less worried risks, could well end real case AZ vaccines probably end used certain groups people.

Im still somehow skeptical data EU countries show pretty big statistical increase risk type blood clot, UK doesnt seem problem vaccinated 10 million age 55. could well bad batch, unproperly administred vaccine knows else. entirely expected avoid astrazeneca cost. I'll stick Pfizer. Reality...  speak contemporaneously subject. Why? understand material. I've seen opposite-a lot people want J&amp;J uses known technology one done deal. wanted Pfizer news variants (and that's family gotten), that's plentiful works out. CDC says vaccinated people don‚Äôt need social distance Ah, sounds like half-ass lockdown Florida month. Gyms, salons, theaters closed weeks food went curbside. things went 50% capacity, 100%, think. I‚Äôm entirely sure things didn‚Äôt change much first spooky quiet days. seeing torrent Chicago.

Chicagoland severely undersupplied compared rest state. 1st dose body learning is. kind like, ""wtf this?"" sends exploratory X-wing fighters go recon. 2nd dose, recon necessary since body already knows bad news. immediately mans death star fires. type clot. seem seeing clots low platelets strange usually incredibly rare. Theres definitely something going AZ. FWIW,I AZ 11 days ago. Yep. solace take mishandling pandemic likely kept reelection.

If he'd handled like current administration probably would won. vitro studies even limited. Uhhh... say hello reality capitalism mask fully removed. think money gates makes round world American? 

The guys mentioned started mRNA research Penn 1998, Hoerr got patent 1999, pretty much time frame. Since 2013 Karik√≥ works biontech. 
This invention single persons, many. living US, not. 
That nationalism kills me. think long vaccine available everyone 16+ distinctions rules unnecessary.

It interesting see biases expressed categories though. Like random dis college students. New York loves health care workers. Virginia, financial legal employee considered ""essential"". also felt aches way fingers toes. Made typing painful. get everyone supply gets caught up, likely able go local pharmacy store get one appointment, it'll easy time off. actually want keep mask mandates restrictions risk ‚Äúvariants‚Äù. interesting thing risk variants going forever... what‚Äôs end goal? Masks forever? still require outside Israel even 90% vaccinated... people getting upset idea things like wear pants, leave house work, surf Reddit day forgot South Africa. data limited. We'll see time. covax it‚Äôs produced... want shift narrative, use another thread. 

But yes, care it‚Äôs produced: that‚Äôs whole US‚Äô Defence Act. it‚Äôs (only) EU‚Äôs hypocrisy. aren‚Äôt British sites exporting anything? nationalistic dibs. 
That‚Äôs also story whole production site Netherlands held EMA approval could solely produce UK even though contractually also produce EU. 


So yeah, EU didn‚Äôt want play game US &amp; UK pushed it. Most? small number wasted doses also less concerning pump twice number doses amount time. Go Brazil! Rooting x Either contains vaccine varients, maintain immunity current ones. several vaccines require booster shots already, like Tetanus. vaccines lifetime that's boosters come in.

I'm sure one work. may need take shot twice again, imagine they'll figure way year like flu shot. Hopefully. Ohio, appointment J&amp;J Tuesday! One done reasoning. vaccine vaccine name game getting enough people vaccinated. friends gotten round ones already, time get number 2 I'll done ready roll....why would choose another option? Combination lower density, less testing, weather. Sunbelt spikes always come later colder weather Northern states. Yes please inject fear veins. scheduled first dose Tuesday! I‚Äôve never excited get vaccine lol fuss made Pfizer vaccine? UK recoded 38 cases blood clotting 12 million doses. people mean AZ targeted. vaccines caus thing rare amounts yet news plastered AZ bet thread arnt even aware Pfizer blood clotting cases. Vaccinespotter.org haven‚Äôt covered risk yet. early today yet try finding appointment. state hoarding doses it‚Äôs hard find. Check cvs early morning. many appointments 4 days adavance. Orlando objection they're unprecedented day-to-day activities like grocery shopping, hair cuts, concerts, people vaccinated, needed. expansion intrusion life want, exist, people scared, probably new theater going forward make cowards feel safe. guy factorios... media always though, trying monetize people's fear? think that's larger issue media itself, scientific concerns variants. studies shown vaccines mostly effective new variants, reported everywhere ideal world. fair, lot areas could probably get away point ‚Äúrace‚Äù next surge vaccinations. words, could reopen everything ‚Äútoo early‚Äù, time next surge would picking real steam another 4-6 weeks now, willing people already vaccinated. 

My state, Arizona, basically removed restrictions last week executive order. fairly stupid move, especially since one big reasons ‚Äúeveryone eligible vaccine‚Äù, literally opened eligibility previous day; millions people chance get shot 24 hours, there‚Äôs 5 week lead time full immunity. one hand, pretty dumb. hand, I‚Äôm concerned all, spread low right it‚Äôll take quite weeks virus multiply enough actually surge again, time we‚Äôll probably like 60% vaccinated. vaccinated proven limit spread? Yep, believe it‚Äôs rare blood clotting disorder, rarely seen - except complication oral contraceptives. Probably testing hope emphasis put university students city (and cities). reason huge spike fall. came town, packed bars huge parties, next thing know city's cases went ~5/day 200/day. first bulk cases 18-25 yr range, month spread older age groups, including elderly folks care facilities. sad. I'm really hoping thing happen next fall.  October Netherlands! totally agree. CDC released study saying vaccinated people get sick carry virus. Positivity rate useless metric engage everyday activities.

Highlighting this. Every damn discussion gets ""bUt ScHoOlS rEQuIrE vAcCiNeS"" responses people, point discussed. passports **grocery shopping, movies, restaurants, etc.** Netherlands: take whatever need.

I get die. I'm cuffing bulb fields fence. compared 38 blood clot reports UK 12 million Pfizer doses. low worth worrying about. US example, nearly 1000 people die nursing homes every day normal year, things like infections, sepsis, renal failure, falls, etc. Statistically people nursing homes die average within year. change vaccinated. report give age people side effects would assume many severe reactions among elderly already poor health.

With 35 million vaccinations given UK, 283 fatalities 0.0008% would still 99.999% safe. either done Pfizer early on, done recently included figures.

I'd estimate around 2 million 50s AZ, 25 cases would around 1 100,000, similar seen recently Europe. Hopefully could factor. Maybe also (1) warmer climate allows outdoor dining, (2) virulent strains taken hold YET, (3) lack public transit (everyone car)? need clear reporting. disclosure, much prefer mRNA vaccines given blood clotting disorder AZN. going report fatality count, must clear fatality count people received vaccine died, mean vaccine killed them. 

can rare blood disorders kill? certainly. AZN cause them? evidence seems dictate that. every case death vaccination, i.e. heart attack, stroke, etc. due vaccine? certainly not. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

The big conference mRNA organized curevac biontech. paperwork explain vaccine approved? references? choose others choice I'd obviously choose Pfizer Moderna means get vaccinated months I'm fine AstraZeneca. words, I'd take either. PS. I've already 1st dose Astrazeneca 2 weeks ago I'm still alive now! Conservatism wierd. actual vaccine passport consists QR code containing name, vaccination status digital signature verified.

Check EU Green Certificate they‚Äôre rolling Europe Welcome Reddit sir, must new here. Russian vaccine sufficient safety data started mass vaccinating people it. AstraZeneca vaccine *twice* issues data (incomplete incorrect), inspire confidence them.

But, yes, money always factor.  Fauci said we‚Äôd still mostly lockdown way, lot people locked hard probably aren‚Äôt testing waters right reason. 

That lot people at-risk relatives home require caregiver would screwed tested positive self-isolate 14 days. No, you‚Äôre clearly engaging propaganda. 

We‚Äôre talking 90 percent people passing virus. 

You completely ignored fact went spiel people declaring victory early. 

Maybe wasn‚Äôt intention, definitely come saying ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs let people know truth vaccine do, may engage behavior don‚Äôt like.‚Äù

That‚Äôs propaganda. else talking unrelated things? treating politics like sport supporting team. logic applies. That‚Äôs madness.

Try two Google searches see mean:

We've intense restrictions long. talk friends indiana north Carolina like covid never even everyone behaves/businesses get open.  ""The FDA also allowing 11 doses extracted current 10 dose vials.""

So admitting over-dosing people revising dosage ~10% lower now.

Not confidence inspiring all. Ohio right entire pandemic. shut schools new york did. Everyone wants vaccine get one summer though. vaccinating ton people April May. 

If look New York example 6.2 million received 1 dose.

Less chance new variants form that's thing get blood clot. chance hospitalized covid higher getting blood clot Better formatting would saved gag. little.

Bummer propaganda seems disagree despite CDC literally walking back previous statement. Thanks sharing links. There's clearly relationship lab neutralization real life, however I'm trouble figuring exactly nature relationship.

The papers linked show plots x-axis titer ratio vaccinated / convalescent patients. use ratio find linear relationship associated correlation vaccine efficacy.

The linked paper OP's article takes serum either convalescent patients vaccine recipients dilutes serum looks neutralization %.

Without raw data I'm unsure combine two concepts find estimated ""real life"" efficacy would OP's paper. Source? press release Pfizer came yesterday, small sample size wide confidence intervals (95% confidence 53 100% efficacy). CIs show likely Pfizer doesn‚Äôt large drop fear AZ Vaccination numbers may wacky today. Totally forgot Good Friday choice get Pfizer. 3 weeks shots versus 4 Moderna.

Functionally, they're same. lipid envelope dosage different mRNA bits almost exactly identical. Based observed Israel UK pace vaccination US, yes, things noticeably better summer everywhere US. I'm demanding it. care do. protect MYSELF... keep getting flu cold helps asthma. used inhaler five months -- first time 25 years. vaccinations random, would mitigate fourth wave much smaller percentage exposures would result hospitalizations.

Kicking ass right lol Netherlands, 400,000 doses AstraZeneca corona vaccine, blood clot lower number platelets observed five people, reports side effects center Lareb Friday. One persons died blood clot formed lungs, resulting fatal pulmonary embolism.

All five cases blood clots diagnosed women ages 25 65. got first complaints seven ten days injection.

Dutch doctors received advice Dutch Internists Association (NIV) someone develops rare form blood clot vaccination AstraZeneca vaccine. blood clots probably treated well examined time anticoagulants administered. I'm really waiting US finally vaccine supply demand. strongly believe that's chain reaction start...if start exporting. 200M vaccine doses (rough estimate everything's ramped up) every month going, hopefully, countries, countries also done exporting, - that's chain reaction whole world done. Ohh scary variant article. I‚Äôm sure subs article week better yet, usher workplace culture okay call sick feel pressured come in, unmasked not? look county county, especially outside metro areas, sample sizes small given wild variability data point. look NYS whole, see definitive plateau since January may beginning relatively minor fourth wave infections probably spurred warmer weather. Honestly vaccines great save countless lives. Let's get fanboy particular vaccine like phones. It‚Äôs weird villainized Russian Chinese vaccines try tarnish az reputation. Almost there‚Äôs money involved making us top provider monke fact ask question hilarious.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 8 years Reddit taught definitely dumb questions. I‚Äôve even asked dumb questions myself. Gonna get Johnson Johnson vaccine less 2 hours. 

Only time life excited getting fucking shot :P That's incorrect assumption make. Data good used. 7-day positivity metric meant assess trends, really 30-day period. double speak? keep alive gives blood clots send hospital. want astrazeneca go ahead take it. be. experience told ophthalmologist it‚Äôs demand low long time kids returning school adults office (or more) year home they‚Äôre noticing can‚Äôt see shit flooded system. vaccine available, unvaccinated at-risk people option staying home fully vaccinated. checked CVS's website day various states. states (like Indiana) fairly booked.

Kentucky: Wide fucking open. Every single one appointments available.

I think we're good, thanks. here. 

Second dose Moderna left 101.5-102* fever, muscle joint aches, sore arm, headache 36 hours. rough well worth That's true, I'd say there's equal amount ""UK bad EU good"" posters sub. level motivated reasoning sides really depressing, hateful nationalists stripes make toxic environment there's little room objective analysis. I‚Äôm myself. Allergy season dog shedding. Hmmm Covid causing tightness pet? sub turned worst kind circle jerk thinks even mildly bad news must fake. 

Sure, everyone pays lip service idea following science. people couldn‚Äôt pick good science lineup. show cards want. state's immunization database (and every administered shot supposed be) card pretty piece paper. Nah. I'm pretty aware that.

You keep blindly groping number darkness even provided vax school children. numerous counties full individuals refuse get one. Which, turn, expose kids virus create rich environment variants.

Like, want sit argue semantics Free Apps coupon Wendy's drive-thru: let stop you. 

Ten percent 150 million people still ""a lot fucking people."" that's vax. Take stats, stickbug. viral vector vaccines!

No one expected kind efficacy. anecdotally, 18 year old myself, friends peers didn‚Äôt really hold end bargain lmfao. never even acted like pandemic begin Michigan resident, I'm prohibited law praise Ohio way. However, say non-Ohio states would smart. Good. Yeah statistically won't. offered AZ suggest take it. end day keep alive hospital use one first understand means bud. don't. lot people haven‚Äôt worked year don‚Äôt skills needed WFH jobs waiting 3-6 months hopefully people vaccinated testing waters. humble decent rest us.... police boy descriptor could find wax imagining

Your autocorrect dirty. Man, can't upvoted more. exactly right. inhibiting children's immune system right number restrictions imposed them. favors Fauci's comment masking children vaccination absurd face demonstrates one sided become COVID without looking bigger picture public health. 

While sucks say, young children need exposed low level viruses build immune system. truth statement ""what kill makes stronger."" ignored last almost 18 months. Bro isn‚Äôt Europe. Taking away places impoverished nations stopping manufacturing India awful many die selfishness really think right approach. 

I also think people barred leaving homes winter flu. Even flu shot doesn‚Äôt stop people spreading virus. people careless interact others flu season, need imprisoned. thought 2.7 million across full population? 

[Based article, suggests that's total number AZ way, UK revealed age breakdown events... i.e. know 30 cases occured 3 million 50s doses.

There seems unknowns moment, long MHRA/EMA/WHO say safe hesitating take 2nd dose. someone lived state left, resemble statement. They‚Äôve months now. I‚Äôve seen comments people whining older haven‚Äôt chance‚Äî also reveal brand shop. get tested symptomatic. lack testing means less symptomatic people? That's great! Got shot side effects except slight soreness upper arm. even bad enough take tylenol. get magnum Moderna? Damn shit Depressing grateful live US. Health experts disagree you. qualifications make claim? sinovac one effective? I've heard good things efficacy I‚Äôm philly think it‚Äôll pretty much Summer 2020 Part 2 - street festivals, indoor events, indoor dining bars, masks outside house. difference expect able hang indoors friends we‚Äôre vaccinated ya go bud.  ya go bud.  helps large city, I‚Äôve heard.

For real, 70% rural population refuses get vaccine, end tons extras. Ohio people, book appointments rural areas! mean... typically flu shot effective compared others, think best comparison (given published numbers personal experience getting shot still getting flu come February) far, vaccines books effective every widespread variant aware of. However, important ever stop spread much vaccine distributed. Unfortunately, seems like well... cases rise right now.

For whatever reason, seems variants become bigger problem now. I'm guessing must take year SARS-CoV-2 mutate significant ways, we're right one-year threshold. literally race time point. Yeah, last one, next one... Brazilian seeing P1 variant close, fear guys whole world. variant spreads much faster, send lot people ICU. 

To put things perspective, month March variant really hit country 20% whole COVID cases Brazil since pandemic started. one month. also sent people 20 50 ICU 250% 600% before. hospitals country 100% full, 80% people 30 50 ICU. Lots young people dying, risk factors, without factor. 

Sure, still small percentage death compared number people infected, issue variant infects much people time, sending much people hospitals needing ICU care time, collapses health system. 

The exit vaccinate people, lockdowns/stay home/only leave necessary always using masks, alcohol keeping distance. 

In brazil, though, lot misinformation spread conservatives, including president, like take precautions want city opened like normal, insisting ""preventive treatments"" work, leads people relaxed go out, resulting situation cannot emergency life needs ICU ICUs completely full Covid patients. 

 

Take care! Small correction: 1 million doses, 1 million people. 900k first doses 100k second doses. ""Waves"" ""surges"" two different occurrences. think vaccinations ramping fast, wave possible unless entire collectively dropped restrictions (not gonna happen). 

We see pockets surges next couple months (i.e. Michigan, NE states), general vaccinations outpacing everything. key hospitalization metrics continue go down, huge. cvs independent:
We make $25 per insured patient. $0 per uninsured. hope buy something store third people getting driving 2-4 hours Seattle giant CF small town mass site.

I feeling scheduling system also helps labor cost. look upcoming patients add system minutes downtime. built right, auto-port over, doesn't. downing Tylenol night still feeling like garbage. took care getting whooped vaccine #2, turn second dose Pfizer Tuesday. 12 hours chills, joint pain, headache Tylenol-resistant fever 100.4-101.1. 

24 hours fever subsided. 8 hours headache subsided. evolutions take long missing process gain FDA approval? Lmao misinformation. stipulated *certain cases* vaccinated people need socially distance. said vaccinated people hang unvaccinated people *one* household.

That *so* different ""not social distance.""

It still recommended avoid large gatherings crowded areas. likely pandemic declared country.

Why guys think ok funny spread outright lies CDC said? OK. know that, I'm ohio least appointments go extremely quickly. work hospital got mine january, boyfriend much harder time. released mass vax sites though finally got appointment tomorrow fairgrounds.


Ohio also opened vaccines neighboring states really hope anyone's trouble come get one. Keep plugging away, get there. It‚Äôs literally sub. It‚Äôs posted 4 times today Remember painkillers! Meh, think interpreting malicious was. funny song. Chill out. many states still many people aren‚Äôt eligible it‚Äôs extremely difficult get appointment. think Memorial Day good go open everywhere. would work logistically vaccinating entire population every year thinking. hate negative stuck head got Moderna yesterday could barely feel it. It‚Äôs normal bit nervous trust me, it‚Äôs big deal! second poster saying go focus something else can. Great news, hope deliveries keep coming. might better approach things vaccinated open them. quarantine use 10 sick days stay home(obviously they‚Äôre working home doesn‚Äôt matter), don‚Äôt worry getting sick losing taste, don‚Äôt worry possibly spreading it, they‚Äôll feel lot peace mind going places. anxiety gone way since I‚Äôve fully vaccinated. Obviously going depend friends thoughts feelings towards Covid. they‚Äôre already partying probably don‚Äôt care. even print email trial? ‚ÄúThey fact isolate gave year lives‚Äù

They didn‚Äôt, went business usual. Except losing graduation normal freshman year college lmao Ok, stand corrected then. increase numbers many states would represent either blip new status quo awhile huge increase? would positive. Shame something like United Nations couldn‚Äôt cover bill countries allow safety around world. initially told labs shut down. Apparently mammograms course would big increase turning people away first place opthalmologist probably neglected tell whole story drove work noticed nobody road. wish could one people saying pandemic May June don‚Äôt see fact vaccine isn‚Äôt even open general population yet. 

Not get political Murphy re-election worry about, NJ could track achieve significant degree normality Fall. Sinovac Oxford now, made house. April supposed receive Sputnik (but it‚Äôs approved use yet) Pfizer.

Jensen also approved, receiving starting July. I‚Äôm Dr fast US vaccinating, don‚Äôt see get 4th wave either. would take long time mutation form vaccine resistant. Plus people getting vaccinated, rate speed mutations occur going slow significantly. case, wrong choice. Pfizer JnJ offer strong protection. think one suited age demographic another. getting shot right call. 

But, yeah...there advantages disadvantages far distribution logistics. Especially relevant given people get hospitalized covid likely underlying health issues first place. shall see. get 50% population that‚Äôs cases nosedived Israel. happen think things open up.

It help 12-16 likely ability get shoot couple months supply starts exceed demand. hope you‚Äôre trolling I‚Äôve thought really dumb college students last ones vaxxed. literally forced living communal lifestyle, much more-so lot us. eat cafeteria filled lots people, roommates share bathrooms dorms, classes hundreds people them. Yet get vaxxed last... seems like want stop spread vax people likely spread it... think. need order Pfizer. Obviously really immunocompromised kids go right now, great majority 16+ get vaccinated issue would little spread Hell yes. know Fauci pretty conservative comments, saying formal interview means they're pretty confident. are. know personal situation, unless person 16 absolutely vaccinated. Then, according CDC, can. parents continue need keep safe, like covid thing huge good news hear like means soon enough we're going position export doses countries *desperately* need this, especially South America Europe places rough right now, also neighbors north, Canada. anyone looking Cincinnati, go university health services local kroger‚Äôs little clinic them. finally became eligible Ohio opened 16+, college immediately began push students. Mexico part north america. mom dad got vaccine #2, we're fully innoculated!

Problem: vaccine whooped mom's ass dad's worried he's calling doctor. feeling fatigue headache arm hurts. think depends live. expect vaccine acceptance high NY/NJ. Appointments get taken within seconds released. 

Especially neighborhood vaccinated 50% adults dropping eligibility vaccinate 50 without preexisting conditions. think 90% adults neighborhood specifically - lot wealthy, white, liberals. yeah, one talking pfizer truth. trying stereotype, dutch people healthy. wonder less % population preexisting conditions factors this? Yeah, like college students inherently risk- they're fucking idiots. get vaccine early they're assholes follow COVID rules.... vaccines using? Nope, comment whether gave year lives. Finally! Let's go! vast majority AZ vaccines Germany given 65s, originally even approved 65s. yeah, agree definitely need extra statistics made public remain cautious conclusions then. Need medical provider now, believe need HIPAA release individual searched for. ""The FDA also allowing 11 doses extracted current 10 dose vials.""

And changing new vials 15 doses instead 10, lowering dose ~33%.

So admitting over-dosing people revising dosage ~10% lower now.

Not confidence inspiring all. Boy, questions highlighted here, really angling downer answers. Vaccine passports pointless herd immunity reached. realistic present negative PCR test want travel internationally. grew Wisconsin Iowa everyone nice. 

I live Wisconsin, live plenty assholes (Eau Claire). Thank wanted know.  Unless immunocompromised person protecting can't yet. Yeah good, we're also going new appointments first doses April. Hopefully we'll get supplies soon. ‚ÄúOld school‚Äù meaning, ‚Äúsince 2019‚Äù. That's huge J&amp;J testing teens too! Fingers crossed everything works smoothly. children immunocompromised 65+ crowd major risk clog hospitals there's surge. 45-49 group's IFR 1/9th 65-69 group goes lower younger are. Someone positions power need set firm goals meet. We've gone let's keep hospitals overloaded triage happen people needlessly dying somewhere far different. thing is, choice close normal summer, nobody else's. New York, eligible vaccine. gotten one yet? do, fully vaccinated, go want almost zero risk getting infected transmitting others. reason worry anymore get vaccine. What‚Äôs strange opened vaccines K-12 teachers college/university teachers weren‚Äôt eligible category. eligible college students pose risk, weren‚Äôt college/university staff priority? No, going pandemic forever... course gonna end. neighbor epidemiologist told there‚Äôs meaningful difference 90% 60% comes vaccine effectiveness. Canada also needs doom coverage, exclusive Brazil, EU, US. get vaccine card. I‚Äôll seeing signed note too. That‚Äôs good idea.

I can‚Äôt get vaccine passport app, believe show card lieu it. note accompanying good since look weird - AstraZeneca listed shot dates 2020. good reason never move Indiana. proof residency thing would affected homeless folks anyway.

That Gary been, even finding ways around it. Ah it‚Äôs good. bit risk sure, also wanted chance get vaccine early make bit money side. admit felt bit unsure reading mRNA concept worked, reckoned worst thing would happen wouldn‚Äôt work. People predicted April 12th peak numbers start declining there, barring something going massively wrong variants.

So expect things mostly take trajectory last year end summer, hopefully we‚Äôll enough people vaccinated avoid Fall/Winter spike presented new data confirming explained article adjusted doses efficient, what's wrong that? learning process, nothing like done we're going keep hearing changes like fine-tune out. 

This expected. countries placed orders, payment occurs doses received/in tranches seem impression medicine vaccines 100% safe. Hate break every vaccine every medicine comes risks. Nothing 100$ safe zero risks. question hand whether benefits outweigh risks. Funny viral vector ‚Äúknown technology‚Äù it‚Äôs around since 2019. absolutely agree you, would surprise New York New Jersey say ‚Äúwe keep masks till kids get vaccinated‚Äù. goal posts keep moving, don‚Äôt doubt they‚Äôll Move I‚Äôm trial six month follow last week. drew blood sent way. They‚Äôre also asking us continue filling online survey week asks we‚Äôve experienced COVID symptoms; also want us call come it. 

So long still get paid visits filling survey, I‚Äôll keep showing lol. Yea fucking seeing stocks often sold market biotechs litteraly fuel research dude. Im done convo. full people dont know shit world think do.
You want rob people.
Simple that.
I dont talk theives. Youre low life pretending high horse. Get fucked. end get card stock vaccine card first dose, got photocopied piece paper. real card looks fake. agree, booster factor? anticipate everyone going need sort booster Oct/Nov get us winter really give Covid death knell. assume CDC considering that, think something needs addressed. Lack workers human rights. I‚Äôd willing put masks large gatherings protect kids don‚Äôt really want unemployed another full year. ones? see information? Thanks. Translation: Meh. Ohio 28th vaccination rate New Hampshire (which top comment thread ton complaints about) 21st.

I think ‚Äúdoing right‚Äù tough thing judge. Reading comments you‚Äôd think Ohio utopia vaccine management states fire. know CDC lady nut job even Fauci like hey chill out, bad. think little - I'd say Memorial Day close normal remaining minor capacity restrictions (probably packed nightclubs point), July 4th essentially normal hurdles. Example: mask mandate airplanes removed, expect replaced passenger providing proof vaccination negative COVID test order fly. possible China Vietnam, UK? brakes definitely need pumped. Around 1 4-5 adults least partially vaccinated, immediate drop distancing 90% effectiveness started announced widespread.

I hope Fauci right, seems lot people ready immediately ‚Äúgo back‚Äù option. P1 variant recently identified several parts U.S., fast say could see becoming pretty dominant strain soon enough.

Weird hypothetical wondering anyone knows answer.

Let‚Äôs say get Pfizer vaccine. 10 days after, come contact. usually takes 2-14 days show symptoms. 

Let‚Äôs say start showing symptoms 2 days later... 4 days later sake hypothetical. Pfizer vaccine offering protection (14 days shot) would help lower severity, - came contact 10 days shot, still wasn‚Äôt offering protection. 

Tl;dr: first Pfizer shot, come contact Covid, matter came contact, started showing symptoms comes efficacy. easy say nobody US want AZ needed frankly wanted Welcome Texas. statewide mask mandate. However, Austin north Austin city Round Rock court keep mask mandates. majority businesses still requiring masks. includes work non-profit. 

I've shots, continue wear masks public situations encourage others so. I‚Äôve saying beginning. It‚Äôs obvious anyone half brain No. war.

Because carers life would riots demanded didn't. I'm gonna walk real slow.

You: ""I KnOw cUz EbOlA""

You: (not comprehending simple statement) ""r u illeterte"" place report long term covid symptoms? taste months Covid. would love report somewhere research hardest time. Yep, vaccinated skew towards older population, deaths shooting this. 70% 65+ 2 weeks past first dose, I'm sure big portion remaining 30% COVID antibodies.  dud vaccine anyway think drop want unblinded faster Incorrect vaccines also stop asymptomatic spread least pfizer does. part problem US encouraging people take J&amp;J actually going prolong pandemic Staff teleport work day too. There's staff hospitals get bus work. staff drive need get fuel. It‚Äôs look data points close this? It‚Äôs science data driven. Look Israel, that‚Äôs look at. What? Accusing someone deliberate misinformation pandemic qualifies bad person. looking official statistics, bunch bs. Also, can't even look numbers look China treated people... even leave residences without permission. CVS easier me. Kroger's scheduling site glitching past week so. war. Chinese Vietnamese carers able it, europeans not? city's vaccination efforts slow, disordered, mismanaged. significant portion city's pop vaccine-hesitant means think cases go enough next 2-3 months lift restrictions place. look forward seeing friends again, things previously part everyday life - watching baseball game bar, going bowling, seeing live music small venues - gonna come back Fall.  
As masks, that's way city, vast majority people vaccinated (wont happen) pandemic ends; wear mask outside home, might well put blackout contacts tattoo swastika forehead way people look unmasked public. means people experience side effects vaccines.... 1983-2002 13th cited scientist academic literature 3 million authors. I‚Äôd call pretty relevant getting point diminishing returns. He's kept charade going months finally drawing close knew since directly involved Ebola response goofy fucking moron.

Illiterate? point. New Hampshire trying get students back home. saves vaccine supply college student back home, it‚Äôs home states issue whether issue vaccination positive case. There‚Äôs little incentive NH want vaccinate out-of-state college students, especially close summer. incorrect vaccine effective Pfizer get zero keep telling people.

Care work also exhausting. cannot care without breaks away work. work home expected live in. May not? Definitely not. 

Fauci terrible public messaging. get wanting rule things entirely, definitely need another vaccine point. Yeah said sarcasm thing serbia (note get mostly sinopharm) young people getting hospitalized, that's population refusing vaccines I'm fairly sure covid early on, testing. think may attributed reaction vaccine. 

A lot say reaction 2nd dose. makes sense antibodies know dealing 2nd. hard estimate r0 way spread occurs much based super spreading. r0 naive population going quite high due super spreading super spreading potential goes going see go faster expected. Looks like 65-70% suggesting real world r0 2-2.5. potential overshooting go natural immunity quite high this. I'm Cincinnati area. Every place check says they'll message comes available. know potentially length immunity gives? one cited Ebola know him.

Imagine trying anything requires concentration noisy co-workers around you.

At home, private room work in. say Fauci bad person? Crude. sure effective, know governing Serbia. 

Once enough vaccine America everyone vaccinated FDA authorizes vaccines better emergency use, expect antivaxxers experience lot pressure vaccinate.

Do really think businesses going put people bringing covid office times year? wife‚Äôs work sends everyone fever home 14 days unpaid. extra work falls people don‚Äôt get covid. resentment alone poisons work environment. 

That‚Äôs stick. 

The carrot like promotion museum weekend. Free vaccine card. 

This vaccine party barely even started... give six months. relevant award meaning it. ceremonial pretty huge stretch. Biden made good moves vaccine front, feel Summer. Everything playing last couple months planned Trump.

Biden organized additional manufacturing, doses delivered yet. needed include things like holograms paper make difficult fake Lots us coming dispensaries fair Butanvac, UFRJvac Versamune 100% national vaccines developed right (only first ready). makes huge difference logistics price optimization. Given size vials, also improve shipping since doses given box. deadly pandemic, one ""having life"" right Pfizer superior across ages. made right decision someone cannot get two doses getting one dose J&amp;J better nothing. anyone get two doses strongly recommend get two-dose vaccine aZ. suspect two-dose version J&amp;J good approved probably June Actually, no. Wherever get positive test it‚Äôs counted. Healthy persons zero risk covid19, vaccinating like crazy. 100% science medical common sense. really thought true, would say wouldn‚Äôt fourth wave? really wanted keep going would hammering home going see fourth wave gather Easter all. kind mental gymnastics believe means vested interest keeping going? holiday don‚Äôt gather all. boyfriend got first dose Pfizer Tuesday, Wednesday morning, terribly scattered brained. could barely read write anything hours work, struggled terribly trying get ready leave job. passed hours thankfully unless everyone vaccinated, right everyone vaccinated. Yah I'm fan giant corporations cvs seems actually shit together rollout. can't find anything complain about. They're even giving 200 extra hours PER WEEK get done really incorrect. Pfizer best across board. J&amp;J advantages mostly terms convenience Disagree, essential workers window opening everyone. know frustrating work every day pandemic (I work ag), told essential, given advantage get vaccine someone work home? lucky get one mom works clinic, half staff haven‚Äôt been. (65M preexisting respiratory condition) got second dose week ago. Words can't express much means able go without existential fear death crippled life. still worry rest family though. thought first wave never stopped... absolutely welcome news. worried people Brazil awhile situation escalating badly. Menaus avoidable tragedy goes Brazil now. heartening know Brazil getting vaccines organizing dispense fast possible. Hopefully rate increases guys able go downward curve. hopes all.  Novavax probably also irrelevant US time would get approved mother works nanny. people employ 30s showed mass vaccination site Houston. given shot scheduled 2nd one. TX opened vaccine everyone 18. variant affecting people &lt;50 years old more. Death rates 2-3x higher age groups. People 20s dying higher rates. 

[Brazilian P1 Oh know that's what's going on, always interesting actually try defend ridiculous stance. love seeing mental gymnastics. relatively mild fourth wave forecast since late January. Things going exactly plan wave winding month half wan't 5g upgrade. going interesting see stats plateau. Indiana, we've ditched residency requirements neighbors take shots want. think that's China  thread US vaccination progress. happy good progress, every thread pit one nation (or group nations) another? mean, sure, may concern‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt see could actually go way. 

People diabetes probably using multiple syringes per week, maybe even multiple per day. one two syringes average person. 

The scale doesn‚Äôt seem tough. Maybe I‚Äôll offer syringe go vaccine, lol. new kind apartheid. wonder side ""win"". going Ivy League school doesn‚Äôt automatically mean you‚Äôre smart. lot highly-educated people America completely wrong lot stuff I'm taking US indeed shouldn‚Äôt.

Live city center whole neighbourhood basically treating local little park collective outdoor living room (w either masks bit distance people) weather permits, it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs binary lockdown/licking doorknobs thing folks. 

And signals there, indeed waiting data readout data proving transmissibility among vaccinated effectively zero, since wasn‚Äôt original intent (or promise) vaccine anyways, wouldn‚Äôt want vector even didn‚Äôt get sick myself. Everyone right it, never said anything different, people lying get others, they‚Äôre assholes, vaccinated assholes, still assholes. setting appointment soon I‚Äôm eligible 15th.

Period. bs soon! trying argue isn‚Äôt works. probably know I‚Äôm making sure know little protection 12 days shot  Hiya, Bob! meant comment point COVID vaccines return societies liveable state heavily reducing deaths, severe illness, transmission. course, know influenza vaccines work well variety reasons, still allow society function much better influenza vaccines. patient. fun safer. oh right. fucked mah maths

florida still reckless whole pandemic tho I've managing remote team 15 years- panacea many make be.

The cost savings office huge obvious remote productivity corporate America would moved decades ago.

I think amount remote work, particularly day two week model, become far prevalent this. (Sort defacto moving US 4 day work week without actually officially that). think moving ""live anywhere want"" model wholescale yet. Ya, believe that‚Äôs day 12 case detected means divergence infection occurred earlier day 12, discussion section:

‚Äú cumulative incidence Covid-19 cases time among placebo vaccine recipients begins diverge 12 days first dose, 7 days estimated median viral incubation period 5 days, indicating early onset partially protective effect immunization.‚Äù

Source: Yep, live life 2019. wear mask anywhere unless enforced security guards limit gatherings. Enjoy freedom. Eh mean probably like 70-80% less likely catch covid (or least symptomatic covid) say ""you're covered"" risk still significant much weeks later.

But idk point certainly much less worrying wonder institute stamp actual passport people travel internationally. Notably, *0* reports people received Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, though. best knowledge, risk die develop long covid still far higher infection potential side effects, even group ""at risk"" here.

However, vaccines incentive take even small risk available.

However, given vaccinations mismanaged EU, result noticable delay vaccination.

Also, exclude women sub 60, also men? makes sense.

Furthermore, aware similar numbers UK aware current dataset allows us identify complete set conditions required problem even chance show.

From looks, suspect rare interaction going that, identified, would explain cases. 

Anyhow. trust authorities anymore properly manage this. lot people 40 scared minds real reason looking fear porn media.  somebody different opinion you, definitely question intelligence. *because want cause people vaccine start stuff like they're vaccinated*

They already it. COVID basically even Seattle people highly vigilant pandemic before. one cares anymore.  two dumbest things I've heard since February 2020: masks necessary kids superspreaders. NY rolling vaccine passport speak. federal government says implement one, usually means will. Moms fully vaccinated. Dad gets second shot later today, get second shot next Friday! Let's fucking go end nigh!!!! new variants ""virtually risk"" gets bigger bigger bigger. starts 90%+ efficacy quickly whittled less 70%. someone who's 40 vaccinated catching mutant strain NBD, senior may prove life changing.... may go fully independent sell home &amp; live convalescent facility rest life. Anecdotal only, got first Pfizer shot (second one comes week), told act like gotten shot...same precautions, etc., stay way April, even second shot. Here's direct quote fourth wave, could get bad previous know, really think that's going happen. mean, got always keep guard things. factor mentioned moment ago ‚Äî number people vaccinated. have, know, 50 million people fully vaccinated, short 100 million received least one dose. vaccinating 3 million people per day. respects, kind like race potential surge ability vaccinate many people possibly can. hopefully, want make metaphorical race, vaccine going win one. believe will, continue vaccine program, really quite successful, time prematurely declare victory pull back much mitigation policy. mean, wouldn‚Äôt take *one* person get infected, aren‚Äôt still risking even small crowd? Ok cool I'm asshole thinking everyone right vaccine. action social media shaming private citizens know illness. Hope go get soon bud. article, CDC director warns people letting guard due vaccines, among things. Even research holds (and hopefully will), 90% effective means 10% not, 10% extrapolated 300 million people (and worldwide) *a lot people* getting sick dying. People still need socially distance wear masks, least time being.

/u/eamus_catuli lays facts better [their hard comprehend all, excuse always saying that's ""moving goalposts"", real argument even accurate statement since people disagreeing (some think number seniors vaccinated, think number deaths/hospitalizations, others think mass vaccine availability) rather maliciously changing opinions infringe FreeDumbs.

I would say make fair argument different ""finish lines"" regard thing end, said like outside limit. LATEST resume normal life everyone fair chance get vaccine enough time immunized it. Philadelphia isn‚Äôt opening vaccinations everyone May 1st Second dose moderna now. Still alive Less wave like rolling blackout that, think 3 weeks pretty easy get shot. bottom tier scheduled 17th april. sure that's something CNN Sanjay Gupta would mentioned Would love to, waiting become eligible... think shaming people lied eligibility get early wrong, you‚Äôre asshole. Well can't really say fourth wave internationally. differences approaches every country different situation. would third wave country example. don‚Äôt like messaging all. She‚Äôs trying scare country. There‚Äôs difference cautioning people scaring people. caution people without telling we‚Äôre doomed don‚Äôt listen. course people would probably listen they‚Äôre easily influenced media. Hey, I'm sorry naive me, impression still experiencing first wave coronavirus. measure use determine whether are/were 2nd 3rd waves? Never underestimate human stupidity. Ignore ""cases"", matter. Focus hospitalizations deaths, still taking nosedive thanks large percentage elderly vaccinated. Thanks elaborating, actually agree view this. Especially learn effective vaccine preventing infection *and* transmission. Perhaps concept thrown around moment, learn disregarded completely. like 2 days ago. changed dramatically since then? get wrong, I'll fully support him, vaccines, masks, etc. weird without additional significant data. Well, risk high people older young people still spread old people. I'm confused trying say. Tech companies buying space NYC stopping dream full-time permanent remote telling. Finally, long year Putting people jail voicing opposition vaccine make anyone believe safer, makes skeptical even so. way quell vaccine misinformation rebuke prove doubters effectiveness vaccine least NY State, number people getting tested really changed much. 25-30k tests per day. want look granular level county county, find issues. example Nassau around 16k Columbia around 660 per day. really want good representation getting enough tests relative population, actually take whole lot. surprising small sample size reliable. problem really comes population group small, introduces lot variability. tests overall steadily trend down, think start taking wider view instead focusing specific areas. example, instead looking Brooklyn look New York City metro area whole. way variability goes trend data remains useful. Trump right? gone Easter? No, Europe needs export vaccines UK US. 100%s immunology, pretty darn safe. would still avoid maskless large gatherings, now, 95% 100% small group meetings, family gatherings, good go. Data suggest get it, would mild asymptomatic, would unlikely pass further. going get even better vaccination rates increase - I'm thinking I'll able go baseball games July August I've pretty cloistered.

If meet unvaccinated people, can, encourage get it. Every arm step closer full normalcy. get ""I want because. . . ."" want help answer, people help data studies. Phrasing concern helps.

Edit: Sorry grandfather. long run would needed once. 

If concern speed would faster come vaccines administer right there. biggest issue comes corruption. Many places can‚Äôt even get food cause people power steal it. less likely mess (doctors nurses) cause suffer really retaliation don‚Äôt want. (Reason Cancun safe Mexico Mexico go zone whites Americans) got blood work done two weeks first shot showed Covid antibodies.  ct 80+ adults closing 50pct 1st dose. still feels wrong can‚Äôt help think got far wouldn‚Äôt want catch hick :/ stood line 45 minutes yesterday first shot. stood inside place business long around many people indoors year. honestly felt little paranoia people within 6 feet, breathing air people exhaled. Canada nowhere near pace vaccinations US is. Michigan? Pretty also rise despite 35% worse November/December. true healthy people 60. Thanks, tempted travel right considering current state. 2019, travelled New York, Chicago, Minneapolis, San Francisco, reason made feel meh. seemed like thing people fun drink drugs. that‚Äôs different story altogether cats, dogs, tigers, gorillas, etc... rather, behaved like didn‚Äôt even exist. mean imply anti-vaxxer angle, suppose vaccine works advertised (which does) passports really unnecessary. mention everyday activities, get behind. activities ok used for? almost like information changes daily basis. US seeing surge vaccinations many states opening vaccinations younger crowd ahead schedule lead remodeling data Fauci using guide statements. here- starts June accommodated July. Still optional seem prepping large amount requests. Elevators main limiting factor- drop social distancing it‚Äôs going continue issue getting everyone full-time. covid is, far, far, far likely kill you. everyone much fearful preventative measures fucking global pandemic? 3 000 000 dead entire year misery enough get receive vaccine thats less likely harm drive take get it? Yet... Credibility goes ways, say doom gloom not, also price pay credibility. always uncertainty decisions. CDC White House far leaning ""It going get worse gets better"" bandwagon. Maybe they're starting see light end tunnel need warm public idea announce removal mask mandates, opening schools, public gatherings etc... rioting dissent public. Yeah - based recently released data shown vaccine prevent getting really sick getting hospitalized, intents purposes cannot really transmit virus hit 2nd shot + 2 weeks mark. 

Now still theoretically vaccinated get virus - it‚Äôs likely really affect almost impossible pass on. Still good idea mask public around non-vaccinated people, minimize risk bc it‚Äôs good ‚Äúpositive peer pressure‚Äù thing do.

...but otherwise, yeah, go nuts hug vaccinated folks heart‚Äôs content, yeah, around people isn‚Äôt going get anyone‚Äôs grandpa sick (I‚Äôm sorry loss, also driving consideration whole thing, don‚Äôt want vector someone else‚Äôs sickness bad outcome get it) friend moved Maine several years. People still tell she'll never true Mainer. Fuck them. ""it's effective people 65"" 

If actually cared facts, know EMA never claimed ""ineffective 65 year olds"", wasnt enough data 65 year olds time. data there.

And news blood clot issue (which affects people 65) entirely independent that. second dose waiting Green Certificate :)) keep mind much Santa Clara Asian/Asian-Americans who've cautious, even pessimistic throughout whole pandemic. Many friends relatives S. Korea Taiwan SE Asia experienced waves death field triage tents outside hospitals, can't help feel things California gone horribly wrong past yr. always rule-breakers. People lived like COVID totally gone worst pandemic. certainly saying thing. 

Look, easy answer granted full approval companies applied that. FDA going entertain hypotheticals. Damnit! guess it‚Äôs inevitable. One best things train travel showing walking right without getting treated like criminal standing microwave. Let alone comfort travel compared economy seat flight. too. girl whose case picked german study waited 5 days symptoms thrombosis asking help we'll 50 times cases deaths. far concerned vaccinated safe. risk spreading someone else. course risk spread going vary depending near etc.

If traveling risk spread inherently higher compared even sort activities think  United States offering free vaccine shots foreigners months. Weird Canada disagrees think I'm highlighting difference messaging, safety vaccinated takes priority words caution ""Cancel plans unless ""Enjoy holiday, careful vaccinated yet.""

Same information, presented much optimistic way. 20 reported deaths COVID women aged 20-29 Germany. 

Looking stats like shows idiotic world gotten much fear ""unknown"" risks, matter little are. think thought barely carry spread virus. adding mask adds tiny bit extra protection bring zero instead near zero. guess makes sense? wish studies see really difference, especially setting air travel. Hey man saw post history would really advise take time travel bigger city (or anywhere). Staying parents house (especially small town) really drive crazy. grew small town hated life moved parents house bigger city I‚Äôm way better. anecdotal advice obviously don‚Äôt know details life may right you, thought I‚Äôd chime anyways. doesn‚Äôt prevent people ‚Äúsettled‚Äù life whole life. People don‚Äôt jobs, single, living alone separated family prevented whole life. People trapped home abusers don‚Äôt whole life. People medical psychological issues can‚Äôt manage living home aren‚Äôt whole life. Children elderly even needs addressed. 

It sounds like ‚Äúmy life fine I‚Äôll assume well.‚Äù Yet least 75 people upvoted guy that's basically saying need stay almost whole month longer need to. thanks Dr Fauci's tireless work refer immigrants flown around United States well American citizens? reason would check asymptomatic patients? criteria? understand jobs well airlines. 

 curious protocols treating covid infections now. standards developed, non critical critical cases. See much death infection rates, recovery treatment protocols. year plus best stick swab someones nose? case. Quite states do. Biden‚Äôs going take away good buddies NE though. Definitely, something wrong AstraZeneca needs thoroughly investigated.

More less saying current incident rate blood clots less blood clot rates standardly accepted medication birth control. Also greater awareness people likely seek help look occurrences Moderna also God. people know back normal (with tweaks) months now. Wait post saying opposite... fully covered intents purposes. don‚Äôt find abstract. Presenting data terms ‚Äú100,000 person-years‚Äù lets normalize data it‚Äôs comparable. pages 18-19 view data/graphs see much fatal COVID someone based race education level.

For example, I‚Äôm ‚ÄòNon-Hispanic white‚Äô without high school degree, 5x likely die compared ‚ÄòNon-Hispanic White‚Äô postgraduate degree.

Or I‚Äôm ‚ÄòNon-Hispanic API‚Äô postgraduate degree, half likely die Covid compared ‚ÄòNon-Hispanic White‚Äô postgraduate degree. Hope got right vaccines need start again. I'm hopeful personally. feel like they'll keep going rest 2021 least. manufacturer, think, create mRNA vaccine (that tiny company, BioNTech)

Kind of, Pfizer collaboration investing working BioNtech years, [this Signs Collaboration Agreement Pfizer Develop mRNA‚Äêbased Vaccines Prevention Influenza  receive $120 million upfront, equity near‚Äêterm research payments Pfizer eligible receive $305 million potential development, regulatory commercial milestone payments double‚Äêdigit royalties past anymore. Republicans white evangelicals hesitant campaigning info Leslie ran council Huh? 4th wave underway Michigan. Im guessing short term things like indoor concerts common, maybe small venues. large venues would need least 75-80% capacity break even known acts IIRC real one free. Like??? knew going happen. want less security theatre lives, more. already lost right bring coolers backpacks 4th July fireworks Esplanade Boston Marathon route. show sign reinstated anytime soon. going make show ID get restaurant too? end? Well, yeah course people need wait prioritized people vaccinated first. know encompasses lot sports opened outdoor April 1 baseball opening day April 15th Lakers host Celtics. always wonder timing anything it. Hospitalizations lowest point record, state data back March 29th, 2020. Cases low vaccinations going well happy see it. Damnit! can‚Äôt win. Last Yr ppl scared vigilant getting tests slightest suspicions. nobody cares still goes day spreading everywhere gets serious. anxiety lockdown. anxiety working empty building.

Major anxiety everyone started coming back work empty office turned mosh pit cesspool. I've walk office couple times crowded. I'm starting dread weekends everyone demanding ""do stuff"", virus virus. excluded natural infections there's data percentage people natural infections getting vaccinated. can't account unknowns like that.

I think things return ""mostly normal"" herd immunity reached. said, Pfizer published results 12-15 year olds Moderna study 12-17 year olds underway. expect emergency authorizations amended expand age range month two, decently well July 9th date calculated. Good lord. went get second shot wondered pharmacy dead. First time 10 people getting observation hold. Today 2 us. *Outside conservative white men

But yes, don‚Äôt doubt activists make noise it. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre wrong to. Update, it‚Äôs done zero problems, except sudden urge buy zune...have seen latest version windows? Isn‚Äôt great!? seems pretty reasonable! kids 6 younger. It‚Äôs tough year parent hard know ok isn‚Äôt. vaccinated go fully normal. 

Nononono, far know, vaccines prevent transmissions entirely. means someone vaccinated protected damage coronavirus, could effectively asymptomatic carrier.

There still large percentage population vaccinated, vaccinated people still wearing masks. also children people allergies immune issues can't get vaccine. getting two events mixed little.

Philly wartime bond parade turned superspreader.

San Francisco ended mask mandate early (no parade recall). Stopping mask usage resulted sure immune systems handle vaccine less time.

**RIGHT TIME ASSUMPTIONS. intuition different science data. idea safe medical test prove so. PROOF assume furthest data set bare minimum meaning regardless continue protect 6+ week mark**

Yes I'm meaning say that, deviation brought people may reach immunity day 14, might reach day 10, mutant might even hit day 5 others need full 6 weeks *or* possibly even longer **YOU IDEA ACCESS ADVANCED MEDICAL EQUIPMENT**. 

Unless specifically anti-body test proving safe 6 week mark, real way knowing immune yet not, wont find infected. 


**IF decide follow intuition ( exact science ) scientists research letting guard 6+ weeks, run risk INFECTING EVEN PEOPLE**

Is everyone? Probably not, week 2 might plenty people, fact 6+ week data set plenty indicator **WE CANT KNOW SURE MIGHT WELL meant comment YES. makes sense. biggest spreaders vaccinating first? That‚Äôs wonderful!!!!! course doable father thinks Fauci muzzled White House guidance anything ‚ÄúStay home 24/7‚Äù.

He‚Äôs gonna force household far 2022. despite aggressive inoculation rollout, new cases Covid-19 US crept 70,000 again, Thursday ‚Äì highest daily figure recorded since February. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve heard say many times before: progress vaccination stunning example nothing ‚Äî nothing country cannot put minds together,‚Äù said 29 March remarks White House. increases daily cases prompted talk ‚Äòfourth wave‚Äô deadly virus, CDC director Dr Rochelle Walensky commenting Monday: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going lose script, I‚Äôm going reflect recurring feeling impending doom. twatwad sounds like. Fauci says something even remotely positive, it‚Äôs money bank. parents hoping fly visit Fourth July. We‚Äôll vaccinated then. FYI - every WFH job done well 5,000 miles away.

And company considering outsourcing, damage already done. companies year data doesnt matter people go back office - decision already made even hasnt acted yet. Great job, automod. Nothing even close uncivil said. LOL. Two ... Thank much. know word contagious means?

Well, much invest xyz really affects you, wouldn‚Äôt expect people come woodwork.
Ignoring CDC making policy affects literally everyone United States. quite thing. I'm quitting job WFH full time. I'm never going back office unless I'm homeless family Easter dinner two weeks, since husband got second vaccines today. Everyone else (except kids) already finished two doses. official guidelines CDC include following:

1) recommended fully vaccinated individual bother get tested even someone active covid infection coughed directly mouth

2) fully vaccinated people still need get negative test board plane back US won‚Äôt would mean north siders would able get shot. Meanwhile anyone South Westside get regardless age. hope animatronic holographic spectators. Fits perfectly feeling ""The Tokyo 2020 Olympics"" would made great setting sci-fi movie 80s correct time. New unemployment claims rise overall unemployment down.

I would agree low unemployment number important, still important report other. Also article predates todays job report, article even includes anticipated numbers report says positive:

""According data firm FactSet, economists expect March jobs report, released Friday, show economy added sizable 614,000 jobs unemployment rate fell 6.2% 6%""

The article saying things getting better better everyone yet. accurate. masks, testing cheapest way reduce spread. could test everyone every week COVID would never spread first place. state, we've never gone half testing capacity since bumped way end summer.

Mostly makes sense businesses put employees risk. Give freedom, loser. Don‚Äôt touch mine. caught even surprise. think lot us expecting mid May indoor performances. 

Some counties already opened vaccinations residents older 16 too, couple weeks ahead state timeline. large abnormal spikes COVID countries significant uptake Chinese vaccine. Something happen country vaccinating set vaccines.

You probably heard FDA/EMA authorized vaccines worked take 1st that's available. Pfizer/BioNTech, AZ, Moderna, J J afaik. Sputnik also seems well. think people take say wrong way?

Because people, much early life pandemic, saying needed live COVID thus society needed open back without restrictions. flawed dangerous idea obvious reasons, however, counterargument idea often taken extreme need live like hermits COVID drops face earth. 

Chris Whitty trying responsible also getting people face reality that's kind message need. says rate per 100,000 ""person-years"", per 100,000 persons, seems like abstract data set. difference lying making true statement could disastrous consequences. Lying bad policy except war, sometimes keeping mouth shut right call. mean whatever, that‚Äôs semantics. point FDA doesn‚Äôt need rush EUA time horizon measured years. Rounded yeah lol ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù won‚Äôt change fact people going get vaccinated droves

Exactly, seems unnecessary effective mandate make skeptical people even skeptical. vaccines nearly 100% effective severe outcomes choose take them, vaccine mandates unnecessary take vaccinated people's risk severe outcome COVID levels lower many risks take, every day. let people split lanes motorcycles without helmets many states... someone wants take chances COVID whatever reason, cares? make good points. I‚Äôm inclined believe last one real reason. need sporting events make money. understanding one new variants turning affect children far original strain did. think it‚Äôs rumor, contrary OP trying say, it‚Äôs think Americans hear ‚Äúvaccinated people hang out‚Äù interpret ‚Äúyou go out‚Äù sort thing... seems like I‚Äôm one household realizes this. 

My father told friend phone call household ‚Äúis gonna careful long time‚Äù. overhear gave panic attack regarding whether I‚Äôll forced 2022 family. left EU 31 December 2020.  marked CDC? Yes. internship. anyone remember CDC saying walking back previous administration? imaginary expert. Thank scientists, wish dad could gotten vaccine earlier. died covid middle last month close. even appointment him. fucking virus probably even need exist ruined countless lives, including mine. think we're closing initial demand vaccine Alaska. We're 41% one shot It'd hard imagine 50% fully vaccinated They‚Äôre definitely cheaper generally speaking, quality isn‚Äôt there. good outsourced centers vast majority consistently missing service levels quality. 

When hear companies trumpeting bringing jobs back overseas, it‚Äôs usually they‚Äôve realized they‚Äôre taking bigger hit satisfaction they‚Äôre gaining costs study accounts calculating mortality *rate* COVID per 100,000 persons, race/ethnicity education level. seems like good method comparison.

Edit: actually use ‚Äú100,000 person-years,‚Äù I‚Äôm actually sure specifics, still seems pretty comparable. 2 weeks said. Black people vaccine hesitancy group demographic. matter time BLM makes issue. No. MHRA risk specific type blood clot small. including 24 March, received 22 reports cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) 8 reports thrombosis events low platelets, total 18.1 million doses COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca given date. reports Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. thoroughly analysed every report soon come in. note current analysis prints include data including 21 think that‚Äôs exactly Dewine trying avoid. know Franklin county cases highest Ohio state zip codes. started December 2020.

Source: 

Also: continued participate European Union Customs Union European Single Market transition period ended 31 December 2020 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET). quite remarkable people unsure that's OK. CDC literally release guidelines month ago treated like big news story, seems like common sense. understand... acceptable, use see vaccines? Surely think could never meet people again.

The CDC released guidelines throughout pandemic wearing masks, social distancing, avoiding large indoor gatherings, etc. also major news story time.

Unfortunately major news networks decided spend massive portion programming intentionally deriding recommendations, engaging baseless conspiracy theories, outright lying recommendations intent public health officials. pandemic never end forced CDC wear masks forever one many narrative lies they've spread since beginning pandemic continue spread day.

A disturbing amount people refused wear masks social distance lies. unsurprising believed lies never ending mask mandate too.  Statement relevant Europeans/Brazilians/India they‚Äôre vaccinating many people moment. would necessarily expect similar cell responses rather different two pfizers better little humor: acronym confused lol.. I'm lost. 25% American adults say unlikely get vaccine. Massachusetts lower. 70% happen keep mind natural infections add number appropriate completely exclude happened weeks ago, glad see it. amount appointments available insane there: problem, depends 80% immunity really means, ignorant there. take giant grain salt. cautious due ignorance. relatively cases variants US new vaccine coming September handles variants suspect  /reddit Yeah, wtf? thought missed something never read anything WH walking back CDC positions. entire claim bullshit? 3rd wave? happy hear this. 80% decrease amazing!! precautions person encountering depend share. doesn‚Äôt take right wing media realize there‚Äôs communication problem within government regarding covid. 

Just couple days ago head CDC saying terrified was. Fauci saying wave coming. things true. 

The government spends tens millions proper messaging. happening? thing see stock market what's happening cases.

""S&amp;P drops 3%, experts fear another recession""
""Cases increase X State, experts fear another surge""

Every time ""experts fear something"" like yeah fear getting car crash still gotta get work every day. Yes. Plenty people use IM injections. Nah, got really good one. Also one well SA variant. think so, seen California reporters Twitter say include sports. would go see basketball I'm Lakers fan tickets would way expensive me. two weeks saw significant antibodies vaccine. really two weeks (maybe 10 days?) post first shot start get protection builds there. search subreddit first dose pfizer/moderna see info it. Oh no! hope big bad government want see wittle piece paper says I'm vaccinated! b-b-but muh freedoms!

Lol baby lockdown effective pandemic control? contradicting yourself. Americans stupid follow basic rules meant work still vaccine hesitant.. lots terrifying side effects Covid vaccinated.. yes, know better getting actual Covid it‚Äôs still messes head.. someone lives chronic pain conditions &amp; sensitive every medication terrifying decision... Fucking exactly. incredible anyone actually believes authority figure actually wants stuff. president give shit wear dumb face. governor wants people sitting home instead happy spending money. Money happiness good reelection. Gavin Newsom twirling cartoon villain mustache thinking forcing wear mask rest life.  people trying handle coronavirus, better worse. 

I personally think Fauci often pessimistic predictions, sometimes point might damaging effort. example, publicly suggesting could still masking 2022 good idea, opinion, even know worst case scenario would require that. course purpose. He's thinks right, probably served well throughout long illustrious career. completely ridiculous suggest otherwise, could clear simply trying best help country get catastrophe. man fucking 80, even need work. countries call emigrants expats instead emigrants?

On inverse, start calling undocumented immigrants something like ""uncertified expats""? 

Its obviously German. reports biweekly. Last one 12.03 updated 19.03 (due temporary ban uncertainty CSVT), next report due next week. general side-effects (all reported 1% vaccines given) specific ones like thrombosis, CSVT, anaphilactic shock (? sure thats right translation). also compares age gender vaccines used. seems extremely similar yellowcard report, German one variables interest, like specific clustering age cohorts gender clearly stated. Thank posting this.  talked much, actually personally missed past year. Everyone still needs careful respect everyone access vaccines yet. there‚Äôs greater portion people vaccinated, I‚Äôd say, yes everyone still exerting caution. 

Vaccinated people allowed smaller maskless gatherings, doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre cool press reset. lmao, shifting goalpost. Great counterpoint there, thought people talking anti covid measures? mean that‚Äôs kinda article said, right? Also sounds like people mad don‚Äôt full grasp numbers working with. getting shorted that‚Äôs major problem seems little premature. Makes sense. industries mass layoffs lockdowns/restrictions. Expect rich poor class divide even extreme post covid result. God article pedantic misleading

There single vaccine existence 100% effective stopping virus transmission. It‚Äôs simply doesn‚Äôt exist. It‚Äôs like drug would 100% effective treating particular disease. It‚Äôs implausible semantic go around claiming need pretend vaccines don‚Äôt prevent transmission they, every metric, prevent transmission vast amounts actually lot vaccines. guess go around wearing mask prevent pertussis infection vaccine 85% effective preventing transmission? 

Rochelle Walensky made right call making statement. told cannot transmit even become infected major boon spurring people get vaccinated. really great US 3 amazing vaccines use, way...and gen 1 covid vaccines. 
Science amazing! ididmypart.gif feel like one 'bad' sides open ended 'law'. people detained actual doctors (licensed physicians) giving misinformation, sole purpose preventing general population vaccinated, among things.

The US less 20,000 cases per day since June. less 15,000 cases per day since May. less 10,000 cases per day since beginning pandemic, year ago. We're *still* 50,000 cases per day best.

Well, considering things going Europe, might Windows vaccination campaigns... /s Germany alone least three 1.6M vaccinated died. younger 60.  Sinovac says 200 million doses CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine delivered 20 countries.

Plus, vaccination clearly provincial effort, makes sense talk ‚ÄúCanada‚Äù context... Rednecks: ‚ÄúYou underestimate power.‚Äù Thanks! Literally got done! side effects yet! Well, want solve problem, target sociopathic thoughts first. 

How many people die every day give thought to? think overcome sociopathic traits exhibit? ideas? Moderna literally calls mRNA ""software""  would previous easter talking about. year late, half million dead result outlook things.  30 year old male Canada I‚Äôll lucky get first dose year lol. Probably die virus then. think bit both. one level-headed, actually intelligent people last administration. 30 year old male Canada I‚Äôll lucky get first dose year lol. Probably die virus then. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt know there‚Äôs reduced antibody production take ibuprofen. However, guidance (including CDC) take immediately shot, you‚Äôre fine take you‚Äôre displaying symptoms fever chills.

I researched thoroughly getting second shot felt like I‚Äôd run bus 12+ hours later. Wound deciding ride fever safe took one next morning deal aches. . { } think that's quite correct. second dose providing 95% *more* immunity. providing 15% immunity (closing gap 80% already provided first dose 95% second dose).

So 3 million shots split 50/50 would mean 1.5m providing 80% immunity 1.5m providing 15% immunity.

So every day add (1.5m * .8) + (1.5m *.15) = 1.425m fully vaccinated equivalents. I'm saying adding 1.425m FVEs still amazing. is. think accuracy important. Wish included ages OP sitting 7+ upvotes right wing media pushing narrative nonstop. Well, 5 minutes plus two weeks immunity kick in, congrats! Really?

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  US recorded 3.975 million shots today. :D hope momentum keeps going like that's available, means take it. point vaccine really protect one individual, bring r0 1 COVID can't survive population. even you, personally, get full immunity, dropping 2/3 reduce risk entire population. collective risk gets low enough, nobody need mask, social distancing, etc.

I really opinion, entirely sure mean say 80% immunity, 66%, etc. implications 66% immunity hinge absolutely means it. means 66% chance less immune, might OK roll dice. means takes 1/0.34 times much virus infect you, better keep every precaution, good, probably eventually get (and spread) it. means something else, foggiest. Masks cause bacterial pneumonia, flagrantly false information. Tests free CA. safe necessarily safe them. look everyone 29.

Each every one 20 someone's daughter, someone's mother, someone's sister, someone's girlfriend, someone's coworker, someone's friend, someone's student. 

Each every one preventable, requiring little distancing wearing masks careful. No, expect believe that. number reflection extremely minimal testing wuhan wave. Half ICU patients 60, though really surprising considering vaccinating 70+ year olds. 

Anyway, what's important bear mind that, count Ontario US state, [it would rank terms transmission. I'm really sure understand level shear panic numbers causing. suppose good higher standards public health, lockdowns joke here. lock small stores keep schools, factories, warehouses, large supermarkets fully open. Either right all. we're destroying economy misguided strategy. Tough read things like feel you. know connected many passed via friends extended family. 

I know are, I'm thinking hope find strength still become person want to, ready.

My personal experience (pre-covid) losing two best friends sudden car accident nearly 5 years ago. took years finally peace it, mean, stop thinking it. I'm late 30's best friends difficult find takes years trust, companionship, activities, etc... feel close people love. spent nearly every day still miss changed mindset flat accept want anyone losing mind love life losing grip goals, etc.... 

It's easy. easy all. started thinking good times really try picture fall asleep hanging hoping get thought pop dreams. Sometimes works does, wake big smile able see again, even words exchanged. Sometimes get brain give hug, times able conversation like I'm catching happened recently. 

Regardless, hope able find peace difficult find times need most. 

Take care Washington State opened vaccines ton people yesterday. whatever reason got text hours wife, made appointment week now. 

5 hours later, could standby entire month booked county. see care fellow humans I'm compassionate you. I'm going continue wear two sometimes three masks well year even pandemic I'll wearing least one mask everywhere go case might cold. I'm better probably killed least three grandmothers reckless behavior leaving house.  bad anxiety exactly happened me. I'm much better place anxiety/depression (whoo therapy meds), I'm slight inverse reaction I've gotten 2nd dose light end tunnel getting brighter... change mask every day like change underwear every day



So turn inside wear again? 

/s say ‚ÄúNo need wear mask‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou wear mask‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou wear two masks‚Äù, ‚ÄúSchools re-open‚Äù, ‚ÄúKids 12 shouldn‚Äôt play together‚Äù? Valid point well. I‚Äôve become cynical pandemic lol Yeah, things went hard get vaccinated month ago, nearly ubiquitous now. got vaccinated couple weeks back, virtually everyone know gotten vaccinated right me, right me.

And Biden directed increase 10% state due high infection rate, good that. Yep, reminder leaning Pharm companies FDA fucking Twitter night elections purely knew fucked. not. field hospital refrigerator truck shit hyperbole Erm, even second dose make ""fully"" vaccinated Good. remove absurd requirement get pcr test international vacation order return home. doubly vaccinated person that‚Äôs still incredibly careful, I‚Äôm scared - beautiful hear. It‚Äôs gonna weird get back normal. Norway Netherlands gets vaccines EU pool quite possibly impact similar. know current vaccines handle P1 variant? Wow..... just......wow

Umm, ok, goodbye nice day. Yeah, least wait 15 days, better second shot beyond. Oh shit..... woot woot! Got mine days ago. Drink water think need today! Might true demographics vaccine purchase situation applicable countries. don‚Äôt totally agree her, surge also specific military meaning(‚Äúa major deployment military forces reinforce already particular area‚Äù). Given lot right wing-figures already framing influx migrants ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù, think concern using another term military connotations reinforce idea. there‚Äôs still risk transmission, however small want situation look back six months say 'If we'd bit cautious month two would've actually got [vaccinating] whole population, we'd understood lot more, we'd know deal this, we'd probably variant vaccines stocks'. ""I think though seen indefinite posture, think matter probably next year two whilst understand find way responding rapidly variants."" CVS booking system AMAZING! way autorefreshes. ‚ù§ Low literally means get back normal.... keep trying OP give fuck rest country, I'm getting vaccinated myself. rest eat ass Story life Variants today, three months now.  20% US population vaccinated hack it. 

Its actually pretty scary many Redditors premature ejaculations US vaccine program. ain't yet kids. Yeah getting quite annoyed people acting like they're immune second get shot.

Based modern research, **probably** substantially immune 2-3 weeks first shot (regardless vaccine given), wait bit second dose, two dose, 4 weeks one dose really start acting like normal human again. Even though, wear masks, wash hands, go super crazy. Congrats new spouse! That's source first claim, second part seems true. Norway made calculation - stopping AZ altogether delay effort one two weeks. Limiting vaccine 60+ Netherlands probably even smaller impact. Reason: AZ delivers way less doses initially planned. say is. mild case. Like sniffles slight cough. 

I‚Äôm scientist, vaccine, we‚Äôll good go + antibodies. 

I‚Äôll take couple crap days vaccine problem. Personally prefer Cure COVID still three ten times likely kill flu... dying. Plus, correct I‚Äôm wrong, adding another virus kill list endemic viruses deal every day mean one thing... That‚Äôs right, guessed it; dying. 

And variants common increasingly contagious deadly... Gasp! Yup; dying. 

And fact vaccine roll Europe 8-9% date... dying. 

How Africa vaccines nasty South African variant?... dying. 

u/Gizmoosis smoking hopium. Hell lot better nothing, that's sure Laughed loud. heard evidence can't transmit vaccinated. Definitely reduced risk though. Yeah, reasons like take cues pandemic behavior Reddit social media, people trip show righteous zero risk tolerance. also divorced real world; obviously people there, managing continue social aspects lives taking reasonable precautions. (Yes, anti-maskers COVID deniers.) 

But are, vaccinated person, lamenting hugged person year, like equivalent signing someone's death sentence. fact seen reasonable thought process goes show unmeasured messaging be. stark messages obviously meant scare holdouts compliance, already trusting expertise left overestimating danger mundane activities. Good, miss appointment, nation counting right thing. Yeah probably help Vietnam.  owe em pretty damned big debt. rising cases led rising hospitalization rates enough time assess that?  *Maybe* end August. kids 12 15, first Pfizer vaccine, aka one takes 2 shots 4 weeks immunity.

Though sounds like [trials going really that‚Äôs approaching maximum reasonable pessimism. think OP saying people hear ""You gather"" disregard ""if vaccinated"" bit You‚Äôre going admit said ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need mask outdoors‚Äù tried quote public guidance said ‚Äúyou need mask outdoors‚Äù you? though?

I‚Äôm actually sure Chicago specific stats.  know get different allotment FEMA rest state, don‚Äôt know numbers. It‚Äôs stopped age 60, won‚Äôt impact significantly don‚Äôt rely AZ supplies rejigged around. Supplies Pfizer fill gaps young. üòÇü§£ people dying thrombosis ones likely dye Covid19, exposed disproportionate risk. vaccins issue would makes sense use AZ group expedite vaccination groups unaffected AZ vaccin make sure vaccins unused. Netherlands currently vaccinating 73-75 year category, use AZ vaccin 60-65 years old group. FULLY vaccinated, yes. Lots people became eligible first shot. second shot, time build immunity first one. hear is, got vaccine, safe. Caution still definitely needed. think idea Covid much contagious deadly flu, also mutates far less. think two factors balance we'll ultimately think covid flu distant future. Something like that? Makes sense. 

I'm still sure original comment about, whatever. want use 'science' credibility lie people it. Leave politicians. options wait weeks get access safe much effective mRNA vaccines push increasingly evidenced dangerous one, I‚Äôd think would wait Pfizer Moderna. Lots states 16+ everyone point. less week think 20+ states rule.

If they're willing travel another state, finding vaccine easy. Though NH change no-college student rule, dumb rule. Yes...they told already yes yes yes. chance carry virus get infected infect anyone else infinitesimally small got first shot today. 29F. I‚Äôm hoping travel internationally safely it‚Äôs possible again. can‚Äôt wait! could meet people before. understand everyone thinks allowed visit people. stay masked, best outdoors keep reasonable distance. thought already trials right now? Potentially certain groups 60 years. Let scientists figure out. benefits far outweigh risks. Prolonging pandemic rolling fast enough undoubtedly kill people. Evidence deaths blood clots evidence issue serious enough suspension. Yeah, GF (who getting vaccinated today), mentioned seeing sorts vaccine quantity closer by. Say authoritarian pricks, there‚Äôs things damned well. going lunch part trickier line CDC saying ""okay"". Meeting vaccinated friend's house definitely fine, per CDC. 

It's acceptable risk you, point. go eat, almost definitely exposed non-vaccinated people also eating. risk vaccinated person seemingly very, low (although zero). Personally, meeting another vaccinated friend coffee weekend. probably sit outside. first time I've ""public eating place"" since pandemic started, I'm really excited. age group eligible 15th friend administers vaccines (pharm-tech) thankfully, in. Felt kind guilty again, shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm stepping front anybody I‚Äôm eligible. 

Give shot. I‚Äôll catch downvotes this, whatever. Part reason need keep masks distancing shots it‚Äôs easier say ‚Äúeverybody keep it‚Äù enforce different sets rules effectively. There‚Äôs still plenty risk unvaccinated folks, need people group continue following guidance get shots. tough pull start tiered restrictions. There‚Äôs plenty overlap groups who‚Äôve anti-mask/anti-restrictions, anti-vax hesitant take particular vax, people freaking potential vaccine passport somehow invasive regular passport travel visa. There‚Äôs chunk that‚Äôd happy lie vaccination status follow restrictions. Vaccines mean get back normal enough people take follow restrictions interim, it‚Äôll take bit. ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù people whine about, real normal. ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù fight ‚Äúnew temporary shitty reality‚Äù end sooner people play rules. 

Oh, point getting vaccinated don‚Äôt get sick get others sick, like every vaccine. one, though, go public see short term consequences taking - masks, distancing, restrictions. go away soon take shots can. vaccinated people still get tested re-entering US? expect make logical decisions? lot higher faith government deserve shitshow past year. source claim Trump caused implement decision? sounds like conjecture blame Trump hypersensitivity Chinese government. Yeah. What‚Äôs point? Wear masks want. science doesn‚Äôt back up. Even **california** saying this.

If you‚Äôre close enough sneezed on, aren‚Äôt social distancing. 

Nice straw man. see, argument falls apart: Fauci‚Äôs big lie wear mask last March, approval rating gone since quite margin.

A number essentially popularity contest meaningless comes public trust. Plenty public figures beloved really trusted. Bill Clinton perfect example politician lots people love also believe lying mcliarpants.

Bottom line is, lie people longer believe you, can't blame people trusting what's coming mouth. 'But time I'm telling truth!' work. even think issue messaging. issue science work speed people want to.

One observation I've made throughout pandemic degree people understand slowly scientific process works - particularly something involves public health impacting hundreds millions billions people. normal situation, CDC much utters word, usually comes *years* rigorous scientific research, experiments, debate, etc.

But amount rapid pace death suffering COVID-19 wrought globe, we're instead participating real-time scientific experiment sorts everybody - including scientists politicians - learning go.

For example, FDA usually takes many years, decades even, vaccine approval process. reason shots going arms Emergency Use Authorization.

Naturally, people want perfect information fastest possible speed. ""What's that? study came showing vaccine 90% effective? OK, that's settled!""

Well no, that's science *usually* works. people look study, analyze results carefully, create studies replicate results, debate methodologies measuring results, etc. etc. *years* consensus forms. That's world Fauci coming from. 

And making statements impact behaviors hundreds millions people - yeah, there's urge pump brakes making conclusions lest get something wrong thousands people get sick die result. submission linking breitbart.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

 far understand violate rules subredddit.

We need 10K votes get debated parliament.

The current UK rules include family reunification clause. safe ways people family abroad visit them, testing quarantine. doubt she‚Äôs great doctor sort role almost leadership, messaging, tone, etc. 

‚ÄúImpending doom‚Äù outrageous thing say national leader. implies sort existential threat country. 

Also want say probably doesn‚Äôt actually think trying convey concerns situation. nevertheless words came mouth. go estimates 30% people US COVID, gives us additional 71.4 million people sort immunity (assuming people COVID vaccinated rate normal population. problem nobody seems know exactly causes it. know decide anything.

One thing clear though, AstraZeneca vaccine still massive benefit slight risk EMA MHRA continued line. I'm expert asking question made research feel like grip now. EUA faster process overall, reasons including limited require quite long clinical trials getting full BLA. Obviously vaccine companies applied EUAs wanted approval fast possible accelerated trial timeline. seems like particularly abbreviated EUA vs full BLA approval efficacy. EUA need show benefits drug outweigh risks. There's higher standard efficacy required full BLA approval. that's applied EUA first place vs BLA approval.  


Now EUA, continue valid forseeable future, reason spend time money required BLA. almost like asking renter apartment yet - entirely different process. Presumably come time EUA longer sufficient health emergency deemed over, I'm sure companies top make sure necessary approvals point. 

Does answer question? He's right sense need keep watching sequencing remnants transmission.
As lockdown measures, think nightmare behind us. got things called vaccines Chile mostly used coronavac, questionable efficacy. can‚Äôt compared Israel. Low isn‚Äôt no... glut well Thanksgiving it'll opened college students too, they'll able travel another state that's feasible them. Still dumb rule though. isn‚Äôt really related article. get vaccine, stop shaming people. circle. Lol.

No. going wear mask outdoors someone might think I‚Äôm ‚Äúanti masker.‚Äù I‚Äôve men life telling wear smile.

I‚Äôve it. Done it.

‚ÄúYou still it.....‚Äù

**NO.** Fauci goes evidence scientist. Like tells reality based information has.

He's hated science illiterate people year now. finally brings good news STILL gets hates on.

If another variant course mention recommend course action.

You literally shooting messenger agree reality. oh thank you! read article didn‚Äôt really get it, im worried now:) 1000 per day acceptable number. Oh, misunderstood. said ""even tech"" thought meant another reason. make sense now. Swim Mediterranean Black Sea, Danube River. CDC said it‚Äôs highly unlikely (note...unlikely.....not impossible) vaccinated people contract spread virus everyone started point 100 people Washington got COVID vaccinated. People always try twist current story fit pre-existing bias. Congratulations! evidence several EU countries UK. Regulators various countries halted using young people Hang on, cdc director warning impending doom couple days ago? COVID skeptic kind confused messaging Okay thank you. That's pretty good quite helpful Yeah I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs even arguing. Dude tried quote California department boiling health deleted comment said contradicted said. Amazing, thanks! got whipped first one dreading second. Hopefully it‚Äôs easier 3 weeks Actually China billionaires living US. 2019 China 1058 vs US 696. I'm arguing point either way, I'm explaining downvotes.

Your post perfectly exemplifies describing, thanks. EMA suggested report risk might AZ vaccine, adenovirus vector itself, would put J&amp;J similar risk. Hence they're enhanced reporting start using it. can't claim listening science lie people try manipulate behavior. They're going stop believing you.  30 cases 18.1 million shots. Everybody talking 30, leave 18.1 million. national goal 10,000 new cases per day new test positivity rate goal set time ago. getting close that, started reopening variants took root north guess. think that‚Äôs fair, agree. We‚Äôre yet. well acceptable number

Whatever number everybody is

1) eligible

2) wants vaccination; and

3) fully dosed

...THAT number come conclusion

Common sense decency. great see someone sensible this. said things friends following emerging data research, still doom gloom mode. think CDC whole unreasonable recommendations. Again, advocate public health, super wrong things *lately*. 

The somewhat emotional statements certain individuals CDC hand... correct, rare combination blood clots + low platelet count. high death risk, prevalent age groups significant risk death covid. I‚Äôm vaccinated. long meet vaccinated people, I‚Äôll OK? 
 
Good lord.  Yes. Stupid question apologize advance. come start hitting 12 plus age group fall? seems like Pfizer data eua now, submit couple weeks fda approves around 1 month later like prior eua age group cleared least end May?

I would think supply start hit group summer well... missing something. girls 1 3, I'm getting overly anxious turn. really need start publicly saying vaccinated people want. personally going starting living I‚Äôm fully vaccinated weeks need convincing people vaccine immediate ticket (after vaccine fully takes effect is). Finally, appropriately optimistic messaging establishment! keep announcements like coming motivate people get vaccinated give people hope better days ahead following one difficult years decades. said lol country Serbia, anyone wanting avoid clickbait. Thanks. birthday end month. Parents flying state visit husband first time. fully vaccinated 2 weeks point. We‚Äôre gonna go restaurants, DINING INDOORS!!!! die MINUSCULE chance vaccine somehow doesn‚Äôt work them, it. Cases time low area. going live hole another year. realize precious time losing trying risk-adverse? ridiculous. much this. People acting like 14 days post second shot switch flips. even get 50% first doses huge shift infection rates imo. already see happening Israel. gets tested every week fun? Insurance pay that. people get tested every week usually mandated jobs. ‚ÄúAfter everyone wishes vaccinated vaccinated‚Äù might decent starting argument Ohio [29th doesn‚Äôt seem huge differences vaccine rollout states. We‚Äôre much better Canada EU. Nope. Doses same. overfill vials guarantee right number doses lose little shot prep.

They saying overfill enough get 11 full doses instead ten careful use special needle last dose. still full doses.

Now asking permission full vials little full put 15 doses instead 10. actual liquid would still 15+ doses worth (but maybe 16 run space eventually). Yeah clearly live NH know system vaccination haha

Source: signed morning NH protect life, sacrifice rights citizens? CFB fan also wonders partially Ohio State football revenues.

Last thing want stadiums 25% capacity another season. got second dose Pfizer! Feeling awesome far. We‚Äôll see hours. Lol. 

I also trip planned go home Arizona see parents first time since November 2019. I‚Äôm fucking happy right now. disagree, know transmission really jive restriction. really 100 million cases? many second doses AZ, mainly Pfizer. started administering Pfizer earlier. Got Moderna yesterday morning. Felt nothing around 4pm. Started feeling pretty tired might unrelated vaccine.

My shoulder's felt like trying grow another arm since like 9pm yesterday though....that's rather unpleasant. Lol. Grandma vaccinated beach me! Bullshit.  Gone Easter right? doctors well-paid nothing lose shutdowns. don‚Äôt give shit working class didn‚Äôt go university like did. cold af talking 50s done 3-4 weeks ago group 6, would received priority aged 50-60 (as group 7-9). influx cases 100% group 6, period mainly administering AZ. Frieza Wonderswan color. rest who, fools? that. UK variant waiting you. Enjoy delusion. save move out, can't live people like super high estimates doses best case scenario everything went right. Spoiler: everything went right. go right UK's lines either, started work months earlier, mostly resolved doses started going arms. long AZ best, they're fulfilling contract. let thing, working. cases dropping fast. big theaters near started announce they‚Äôll hosting Broadway tours starting fall! Seeing things like starting give little hope, especially worked live events this. Please true! Please true! I'm saying ""health experts"" unilaterally get decide ""past this"" worth return normalcy. complex decision involving health also complex societal tradeoffs. Therefore, ""health experts"" PEOPLE say decision. think read clickbait headlines, go back actually watch read entire interviews get idea what's actually said. really expected come heart-shaped box. Data data. nothing liking disliking it. think half don't. seen lots reporting recently reluctance vaccine decreasing everywhere even resistant communities. easier made obtain vaccine, people get (even reluctance) literally shit before. hell point? great news. Fauci always OverCautious, he's saying 4th wave, there'll 4th wave. Oh thank you, Overlords, permission travel freely free country! Michigan it‚Äôs definitely scary right now. got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday. British variant county got Brazilian variant detected Bay County. scared cautiously optimistic exhausting.

Don't let live head like this.

Get vaccinated move forward life. happy you! LOL least author photographer actually site. disagreed said memorial Day shall see rather Cinco de Mayo. hope able sort normalcy birthday that's 1 syringes per vial Pfizer, 100M syringes US alone. appear nowhere. That's like entire extra factories worth output. multiply world supply 

And course likely need year two. want built factory sit empty.

Solving modern pandemic supply logistics anything else. AKA treat like babies.

I got first dose march 21st, second dose april 21, I'll considered ""immune"" may 5-12 sometime.

I'm comfortable right 80% I'm sitting at. got ~3 months saying ""well I'm finally fully vaccinated decided take trip..."" make okay Fingers crossed!!! lags behind weeks sure, basically 58% vaccinated mean something like 50% people 80% reduction infection exposure ~35 percent 90% protection.

I‚Äôm sure works way, I‚Äôm math guy biologist, half society vaccinated would average 87% reduction infection rate point, assuming numbers naively assuming immunity works way (please correct know might false). prevalence might closer rate birth control actually since 2.7 million total population, clotting side effect seems cluster 55 female demographic. say many women 55 included 2.7 million, based roll going Germany, I'd guess disproportionately made older people. get accurate estimate people highest risk, we'd need info Ah see.

And rising again. make political? It‚Äôs solely we‚Äôre vaccinating people good rate combat future waves it‚Äôll get better Praise Biden! Yea, makes sense.

Pfizer want approval expensive time.

But ask yourself, ask pharmaceutical companies spend money go lengthy process get FDA Approval? saying bother FDA Approvals EUAs good enough?

I'll ask again, EUAs good enough need FDA Approvals vaccines? Hello Marxist Florida completely opened up. I‚Äôm 24 got first Pfizer yesterday one, people trust one trust other. Almost 4 million reported doses today according CDC. US end pandemic even Memorial day? Watch 2nd dose. Knocked ass 2 days still worth it. fair, it‚Äôs double blind. plenty women want take birth control pills. Many know resort uncomfortable alternatives like condom copper IUD precisely avoid possible side effects birth control.

So ""panicking"" mean ""trying find alternative avoid possible side effects"", plenty people ""panic"" birth control pills well. point looks like Atlantic version middle school mean girls totally undermines whatever argument he's trying make turns audience point even bother reading it. like, take Twitter, fooling anyone pretending thought would anything material fight disinformation, wanted win debate show prose skills. Edit: last part addressed author, Go J&amp;J. effective flu shots people get every year.

The reason J&amp;J feels lower efficacy Pfizer Moderna really took game another level. Prior vaccines announcing efficacy, think experts hoping least 50% efficacy upcoming COVID vaccines. much risk someone considered risky pandemic. perspective changed. 

I recommend right number unvaccinated people still there. got start optimistic vaccinated people. safe. them. Take deep breath. Unless really ball we're going putting people fast-food soda rationing alleviate obesity epidemic. probably need like 50% vaccination reach herd immunity considering much natural infection been.

The point saying ""get everyone vaxxed"" even close necessary. day, drugs tailored genetic profiles. supposed take test calms see subgroup people outsized reactions drugs, them. I've lot years, looking back, drugs better chance killing condition taking for. almost couple times. Netherlands halved mortality month. Stable infection ICs full hell.

""Prospective cohorts 3,950 health care personnel, first responders, essential frontline workers completed weekly SARS-CoV-2 testing 13 consecutive weeks. real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status; vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose) people want mrna vaccines.. supply issue since many countries waiting too.. really unfortunate AZ many issues. Correct. Like replied another user, appear least mini-surge NJ month. Hospitalizations increase weekly deaths rising seem dropping now. That‚Äôs one 2 encouraging signs. Vaccines remain eligible people 65+ lot people eligible signing get it, that‚Äôs 2nd encouraging sign. 

I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll increase eligibility soon include younger people arguably responsible recent spread. Perhaps extent. also remember deaths outcome. get 2nd degree burns whole right hand, I'm extremely unlikely die. mean can't negatively affect rest life.

I agree drum fear, also alongside people taking precautions all. course, logical response somewhere between. hard lesson expect learn everyone wants vaccine one? people who've already virus, people got vaccinated, like they're going bumping covid everywhere palestine brought every article health Israel? traveling recklessly shopping grocery store someone taking stringent precautions puts person risk. take individual risk adds collective risk community. That's infectious diseases work.

I live life take risks CDC tells to. 

I'm saying brag lack empathy. US would stupid approve this. don‚Äôt need it. don‚Äôt think understand stressful him, anyone‚Ä¶ tf would want continue, must love death treats crazies? Like cmon doesn‚Äôt count? wealth data point suggesting it‚Äôs completely reasonable vaccinated people gather, including crowded confined spaces bars, without masks. far lower risk driving aggressively seat belt. point willing accept vaccines effective variants? point accept risk children minimal come close justifying restrictions want impose? 

This thinking 100% lead absurd reasons 2022 beyond continuing mask distance. mom finally got appointment first dose weekend :') Can't wait get mine hopefully next months. lol I'm glad hear town took seriously! places US really much contain like town has. measures ""put place"" many states halfheartedly enforced really anything ultimately.

You extremely small chance contracting mild disease. Something similarly bad cold. risk existed forever continue to. Meaning back normal. You, everyone yet, are. selfish fuck. triggered me. going back basement wait government tell next. People like end world. still 11 years left according AOC (unless pass entire Green New Deal) taking away me. God hope get another government check, care whatever else ruin country career politicians jam bill, want free money. want independence self reliance individuality. want sit around complain white men CNN telling cause problem America. Oh well, maybe college professor. seem know lot. Same. book Hawaii trip June hoping change policy Gotta keep same. feed NPCs wonder 65+ reporting variable variability data gathering. Seems like days it‚Äôs low days much higher. suspect isnt product situation ground weird reporting trends. Kids certainly shot records attend school. don‚Äôt know idea comes from. 

My progressive town filled progressive mommy anti-vaxers send non-vaccinated kids public school. I‚Äôd surprised even 50 percent communities vaccinated children. Well.. even it‚Äôs enforced I‚Äôd still say wear mask public indoor spaces like stores (not friends houses etc).. that, go crazy anyone received full regimen +2 week immunity wait died corona? Hmm... would expect anyone work free?

Most kids days loaded debt end college. That‚Äôs referring to. reason, thought talking Seinfeld gonna remind *Susan* licked them. know name governor? Please register vote, educate issues, vote. one important things work. Holy shit, first comment I've ever seen suggesting people may allowed bodily autonomy based risk tolerance. 

THANK YOU!!! 

I sure people like existed 0.5% rough estimate. want get picky, average first vaccine totals per day 1.73M per day, 0.52% population. OP correct. Dr. Fauci met us? Rebecca Jones claims state reported positivity ratios inaccurate way.

Has ever claimed state reports deaths incorrectly? I'd interested hear says it. Every day seems read something reaches new heights stupidity consider wave? see us 2. Might tin foil hat thought, wonder bloodclots young become seized upon excuse triage doses elderly pursue something ad hoc herd immunity exposure strategy BioNtech pump doses finish job. Since plane travel no-no past year, I've stopped checking prices. still seeing good deals, prices risen gotten vaccinated?  Maybe reality?

I mean, Pfizer Moderna repeatedly shown efficiency, also variants, unusual clots UK data vs. 30 AZ... also delivered promised, problems trials, dosage, etc. negative post them? expensive difficult preserve (which already published many times) problems pretty much end there.

AZ, merits, many problems others don't. That's is. US death rate suggests US probably least 2X many naturally immune people Israel. Israel denser many US states. 

My guess hard hit US less dense states probably nearing heard immunity already. denser, less harder hit areas may take even longer 60 days. ""We occupy militarily bottle collective punishment, health agency fuck them."" think happen, given Saturdays biggest reporting days. quite true, it‚Äôs still risk considering 50 isn‚Äôt exactly considered young, neither age 35‚Ä¶ say risk probably won‚Äôt die it‚Äôs still fun dealing possible organ damage, reduced life span long hauler, even horrible 2 weeks recovery 

With vaccine, you‚Äôre fine regardless age..it‚Äôs whole different level safety holds true - might case may masking distancing years come. Ick. specifically issue vaccine dangerous particular subgroup population virus is.

Birth control pills comparable two reasons

1: intended protect person taking birth control pills, anybody else. means individual chose weight risk pregnancy vs risk blood clot. Secondly think side effect AZ vaccine technically type blood clot birth control pills.
 
2: intent force people take birth control pills, movement force people vaccinate protect people. force people take vaccine would kill them, would normally risk virus, saying perfectly fine kill people type protect group people type B. questionable. Maybe try book another shot canceling appointment? Otherwise J&amp;J good better certain areas. I'm saying ""hypothetical"" Pfizer may want full approval. ""hypothetical"" mean hypothetical question, ""if Pfizer apply approval today, any, information would need order grant approval?"" also able answer question know data Pfizer would including BLA! That's whole point application, FDA see data! 

You're thinking two-dimensionally here. Pfizer ""want"" vaccine get full approval, need right EUA. Submitting FDA approval costly process, time money, there's reason moment. Now, saying need right apply approval would granted. know answer that, think FDA either (for reason gave above). would imagine want phase 3 trial go longer apply full approval, see efficacy holds time. 

Does make sense you? Yeah I‚Äôll curious places like France high anti vax population also travels internationally lot happy you! 

I‚Äôm boat. Haven‚Äôt seen parents since Feb 2020 (they‚Äôre side country), waiting wife get hers. She‚Äôll eligible April 15th, I‚Äôm really hoping score appointment ASAP. soon appointments booked, I‚Äôm looking flights. I‚Äôm saying people something look forward to, like celebration almost behind us would encouraged maintain certain standard end. government slowly let fizzle people never know feeling victory. happens hard gain compliance. needs big. barbecue backyard immediate family. don‚Äôt see correlation issue this?  someone would disagreed around I‚Äôm don‚Äôt need AZ camp anymore. Given tendency mess public promises (deadlines latest phase 3 data reporting issue) thrombosis issue Europe rapidly increasing supply untrainted vaccines fine. Ohhhh okay. one anti-pharmaceutical industry conspiracists. makes sense. know anything pharmabros, sounds homoerotic, studies created hope mRNA vaccines fulfil many aspects ideal clinical vaccine: shown favourable safety profile animals, versatile rapid design emerging infectious diseases, amenable scalable good manufacturing practice (GMP) production (already way several companies). Unlike protein immunization, several formats mRNA vaccines induce strong CD8+ cell responses, likely owing efficient presentation endogenously produced antigens MHC class molecules, addition potent CD4+ cell responses56,87,88. Additionally, unlike DNA immunization, mRNA vaccines shown ability generate potent neutralizing antibody responses animals one two low-dose immunizations20,22,85. result, mRNA vaccines elicited protective immunity variety infectious agents animal models19,20,22,56,89,90

Also relevantly, vaccines potential rapid, inexpensive scalable manufacturing, mainly owing high yields vitro transcription reactions.

You give vibe one anti-vaxxer types. Sadly, I'm interested dedicating time addressing misunderstanding misconceptions... Good luck life... ‚ÄúBastard‚Äù (said Stan‚Äôs voice South Park)! Goose stepping morons wear masks instead burning 30% whole nation, least 1 dose. 

Yet overall cases flat. rising fast states like NY PA Government provides funding kinds medical research. 

That mean funding *massive*, government owns results. site used, also look county's health dept site first three waves increasing cases led increasing deaths weeks later. hopefully happen 4th wave due many vulnerable people vaccinated. gave world mRNA tech. Developed University pennsylvania. 
It's used pfizer, moderna, JnJ. Pfizer kicked ass put flat almost three days. 

But weeks sense relief hard describe. number votes show people like read fact.

That's point. India. money keep people ventilators years. difference peak deaths peak cases week India.  thats supply issue. enough vaccines happen expecting happen folly that's normal is. government business-mandatory mask-wearing. read family contracted Covid jab. Fools. understand age factor risk assessment. younger people prone develop rare blood clots AstraZeneca vaccine gave Mexico 2.5M AZ Canada 1.5M AZ week ago. sitting 30M AZ doses. approved probably be. ship wanted. places Ohio one go get vaccine? I‚Äôm trying help family Florida seem incapable finding place vaccines, qualifying age. point? unfortunate, I've seen there's little outreach older folks vaccine. seen zero outreach town except occasional Facebook post word mouth. can't expect older folks hear vaccine internet family. takes one mention placing stock portfolio lives hundreds millions know severely lack empathy humanity. 

Multiple countries including South Africa India lobbying WTO since October IP waivers. Perhaps export ban you‚Äôre talking factor needs addressed. I‚Äôm uninformed topic don‚Äôt take Reddit comments gospel. contention governments lobbying WTO, must believe capability produce vaccine begin inoculating population. pharmaceutical companies main opponents waivers backing western governments. plausible argument protect profit people. case waiver granted, absolute worst case scenario unable replicate vaccine, leaving us exactly are. 

Pfizer recently shareholder call talked profitability booster financial future looks bright. financial incentive allow spread mutations long possible aren‚Äôt even shy it. Note shed virus. symptoms show they‚Äôd infected shedding Yeah dose identical well. think we'd physically sending vaccines people, rather people able get vaccine they're like getting groceries whatever without second thought. pharmacies getting administering vaccines months lol. depending live, high traffic places like grocery stores may also vax site Oh, businesses government mandate?

That's...really good know, thank you. originally September sent email basically saying won‚Äôt give firm date situation fluid won‚Äôt September. WFH full time pre pandemic doesn‚Äôt effect much apply travel policy clear, I‚Äôm asking whether differences Pfizer Moderna formulations, know different. I‚Äôm asking Moderna dose 1 identical Moderna dose 2, ‚Äúbooster‚Äù shot somehow different. That's normal. Normal enough name, ""vasovagal syncope"" get lots results Google it.

Also good idea drink liquids, eat something carbohydrates immediately getting poked. Sometimes makes people feel refreshed feel faint.

You're damn right is! Especially past year, value cannot understated! Using vaccines learning live disease. California's cases dropped UK's. There's lots variables play. Hmm, kickbacks one apparently. Hahaha Leaving aside point-counterpoint format moment, want validate frustrations I‚Äôm reading respect universities general. tend unusually positive view things going particular circumstance, says nothing many deep-running far-reaching real problems probably every university, including mine. say I‚Äôm one basic internet idiot claiming professor, hear you. 

To pick one visible, really really bad problem universities: administrators basically acting like congress members bloating {their own} salary costs way, waaaaaayyyyy control. Everybody else on-site: students, faculty (ESPECIALLY adjuncts), staff getting structurally fucked hard greedy, lazy admins. It‚Äôs maddening we‚Äôre working tails trying right students launch proper careers carrying admin staff like vampires clamped on. Anyway /rant. post post supposed validating also fuck admins. different, use technology. I'm talking mailing people vaccines, rather eventually putting vaccination teams pharmacies, grocery stores, schools, places people might happen be. That's eliminated polio states. Came ask question. small chance getting sick, seem like something worry about. Yeah, 18M seniors. move campaign younger people, wonder (hope not) whether they'll start see more. still penalty medical providers.. border agent asks vaccination history decline disclosing it, turn away. works public schools, unless provide medical documentation doctor specifically states reason can‚Äôt vaccinated Give away stuff already then. like septmeber vaccine really takes effect wonder they'll start seeing start increasingly vaccinating younger people. 

This seems something affects mostly under-55s. UK mostly vaccinating seniors date, might explain they've seen way fewer cases continental Europe (where vaccine used younger people). Yeah, move Arkansas either. dont know actually live california cases still trending despite getting spicy far weather concerned It‚Äôs finally hit Bofa. better last while. Got second Moderna yesterday I‚Äôm ass. crass generalization. [There company called Oramed Pharmaceuticals partnering Premas Biotech develop single-dose oral covid vaccination pill. finished animal trials expecting finish human trials six intimately familiar notoriously right-wing college Ohio amusing watch FB drama üôÉ like vaccine developers supported billions tax dollars hundreds millions purchases anything... we're going tied overly-politicized ""vaccine diplomacy"" China Russia months... 

The developed world moral obligation self interest either get vaccine less fortunate, even better give means make themselves. could save millions lives prevent covid circulating rampantly mutating something tougher control... also give away less doses.

India already producing AstraZeneca, well domestic vaccines. They've proven multiple times they're capable this, there's nations could same. 

If intellectual property export bans could set aside minute, worlds largest producer generic drugs vaccines got green light produce shots, world would pretty decent spot IMO. still pretending intertwined? memory cell formation

Meanwhile, Kentucky's governor refuses outline plan except ""expect masks least end May"". there's framework reopening. seems think letting people visit nursing homes enough. BS sensationalist headline know almost certainly live suburb rural area going walk means pass 2-5 people come within 20 feet them, you‚Äôve ever walked San Francisco NYC you‚Äôd singing different tune. 

I walked 4 miles city today came within 3 feet dozen maskless homeless people, probably 2 dozen maskless non-homeless people went store dozen customers varying degrees nose nakedness. 

I‚Äôll keep masking go outdoors there‚Äôs guarantee anyone going follow anything. Eh, they're working booster shots anyway I'm worried. Would love NE states needed Right now, process older folks talk soccer mom/young relative one vaccine Facebook groups basically professional appointment finders.

Crazy many people still post groups daily bamboozled computerized system simply can't get appointment. goalposts? see strawman argument.

Who even said zero blood clots potentially linked vaccine UK? Even Pfizer Moderna blood clots reported. [I said 19 days (although actually got upvoted it), clear need vaccine there's excuse hold pandemic rages globally. I'm even saying need donate it, go ahead sell profit want, get people need it. 36,71,242 = 3.67 million. could ‚Äòt find it. way works provide statements, provide data back up. two doses Pfizer Moderns exactly same? differences formulation two doses? No. actual data recently 52% effective **after** ten days. 

That's told got first shot. 

**No** vaccine become 50% effective instant enters bloodstream. Germany president? role have? nope. texas fewer immigrants terms raw numbers hard %. california 10.6 million foreign born persons, represents 26.9% population. texas 4.9 million, 17.2% population. fact, new jersey bigger % foreign born persons 22.8%, yet new jersey avg amount kids 23% Better burned ending landfill eventually ocean. ‚Äúdoses used‚Äù rates southern states (Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas) hovering around 60%. seems like hitting demand wall, isn‚Äôt good all. sure are.

The 1918 Flu, please remember use location names pandemics. Hybrid workplace adapted more. article mentions nothing ICU beds surge capacity protocol place purpose. link posted literally says Due response COVID-19 (Novel Coronavirus), many facilities increasing bed capacity. numbers reflect certified bed counts real-time, should¬†not used measure capacity emergency response. would lot worse cause AZ vaccine approved US. r sitting like 30M doses AZ. sure ship wanted. Even worse coronavirus itself. Could also lagging indicators? India's cases increasing every day, would make sense deaths would following several weeks. 1. Pfizer's vaccine 95% effective real world data UK. 

2. virus inevitably mutate manage vaccinate whole world. highly likely Pfizer's efficacy take hit. fuck downvoted? 
I mean, know two reasons, first covid fatigued people want with, reason there's much cognitive dissonance sub weirdo anti-vax """"""libertarians"""""" think civic duty authoritarianism. medical provider would need share details point unless give consent hippa violation. thing happened walgreens. CDC says 42 days fine:

""If feasible adhere recommended interval delay vaccination unavoidable, second dose Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may administered 6 weeks (42 days) first point increased vaccination think places probably going generally OK coming months despite variants, prospect variants spreading additional mammal species pretty scary. Imagine COVID-19 running rat populations urban area. worse, given conditions factory farms, variant spread among pigs cows could economically devastating. hosts infects chances mutate.... Heck! migraine sufferer gets 2nd dose moderna soon good know mentally prepare.... got weird unpleasant joint pain body main side effects second Pfizer dose went away (there side effects, big deal). 

I still don‚Äôt know vaccine. different body aches, felt joints (I‚Äôm young first time feeling this) bed pain joints trying fall asleep... Utah Mormon quiver full movement. Texas has,arguably, immigrants California many major cities. 

Agreed California especially young. Sadly variants deadly. light form knockdown since Christmas Hungary, cases going slowly. British variant appeared number one deaths right needed stricter rules seem working. honest government cares economy stricter rules, could easily lax countries. Take notes europe. it. suggestion would bigger logistical chore lol. far easier run hub spoke model logistics send vaccines everyone wants one  Exactly this. People saying oh it‚Äôs 6 months, like it‚Äôs six months since trial! could years know (hopefully).   Where‚Äôs source claim White House dictated CDC? Definitely conspiracy theory mindset tbh They'll make choice, take vaccine, never leave country again.

The barriers countries place around anti-vaxxers better. Americans undereducated science, us idiots comes reading scientific language. understand use wording like ""there's evidence covid vaccine prevent spreading covid"" definitely carrier getting jab, there's enough data yet say one way another. 

It help media wastes opportunity turn something like ""at least 6 months"" sort scare clickbait headline. mean, we're getting semantics. Vaccinated people extremely unlikely spread virus. Saying can't technically true, public messaging perspective lot easier saying unlikely. I‚Äôm arguing antivaxxers correct, probably aren‚Äôt big problem think. CDC line currently enough research confidently establish vaccinated people spread virus *even if* early research promising. Yeah, many people social media seem think random politicians ***want*** keep people inside get it. lot states point open 16. states (Indiana) little demand, probably antivax sentiment, they're open even staters. Going Miami Beach next week üí™üí™üí™. Putting J&amp;J vaccine work. Scroll ‚Äúless even sick day, like hour two maybe. don‚Äôt know.

All know vaccinated people spread virus therefore act like around non-vaccinated people. Never surprised anything nursing home related, Covid otherwise.

A good portion absolute shit shows whatever save buck and/or maximize profits fucking elderly. worked national company back day handled life safety large nursing home chains - companies revenue BILLIONS. We'd routinely come across panels offline months, detectors batteries, security doors open, name it. They'd flat refuse stuff fixed number different reasons boiled money. go live life paint penis art dunce LOL :D agree people worry largely safe, government agencies need careful making accurate statements. proven said something incorrect, skeptics take evidence can't trusted anything lying public, telling want hear. really need ""buy"" piece paper? mean, come on, print printer home. She‚Äôs nut job all. It‚Äôs job overly cautious many states areas country removing restrictions. example - Texas Rangers stadium 100% capacity. close beating thing, especially later month anyone get vaccine. wants make sure people stay vigilant cautious many people hard time wearing fucking mask. issuing warning saves even lives, good. think he‚Äôs mainly saying variants still threat developing nations won‚Äôt start getting vaccinated till probably sometime 2022. 

I don‚Äôt think international travel Pre-Covid levels years: people avoid you‚Äôll probably still need version testing quarantine rules. also think you‚Äôll see lot workplaces mandating masks Winter: it‚Äôs low cost measure easy way show something stop spread disease. *Small* gatherings, believe. Empirical data easily disproves within outside US. Okay would reproduction number averaged across vaccinated population? 0.01? Livelihood, lmao, that's gambling money. Read past headline Nobody's ""endgame"" deal variant problem getting vaccine everyone. soon enough doses, Brazil really great public system distribute majority public, even radical ones it, willing take it

Most big cities scheduled appointments shots, vaccination centers often empty people going, enough doses 
Good news cities already completed goal vaccinate 75+ currently going 65+ years old like low chance getting Covid vaccine. never going 100%, like like still get plague. one wearing masks social distancing forever, want hide hole feel free rest world moves gonna back source? number people region getting tested longer large enough qualify SRS statistics purposes. apply trends population people getting tested Yeah. trying absolve wrongdoing passing onto traveler. White House that's intervening pumping brakes

Good, CDC actually said vaccinated people spread virus

is objectively incorrect information.

The CDC said vaccinated people aren‚Äôt driving case numbers, say vaccinated people cannot spread covid-19 blatantly wrong. would encourage vaccination policies changed I‚Ä¶have bad news you.  I'm Ohio anyone wants get it. I'm healthy college kid I've got first dose. important part plan designating J&amp;J doses avoid problem I'm even specific america. mean legit country funny people buying fake ones bc costs money getting actual vaccine, free. bunch idiots. Lol Yes do, least partially. 80% Americans still vaccinated. variants already here, Dude. put 2 2 together? Judging downvotes one can't, sadly. Nobody trying manipulate anyone. 

The current administration simply trying everything make sure vaccine rollout return normal smooth ride possible, especially considering last four years been, let alone last year previous administration. 

Stop trying find controversy isn‚Äôt one. I‚Äôm going give entertain bullshit. Yeah allowed family getting together legal country. would 2 week quarantine upon returning anyway Oh Thank God! hang every word guy say post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Mine Monday. already licking doorknobs asking strangers want make out. frequently say MMR vaccines prevents becoming infected measles objective fact.

Your chance contracting measles vaccinated astronomically smaller chance getting covid whilst vaccinated.

This virus shutdown way life, *any* amount misinformation contributes duration shutdown. doctor could simply said ‚Äúvaccinated people *driving* case numbers,‚Äù instead chose wrong. sure! I'm looking forward cooking 2 people again! Diversity strength!

- CNN, probably 99.75% survival rate... easier made obtain vaccine, people get it

I think key there's sort two categories people shot near future (when open everyone area): 

1. would get easily available, like walk local pharmacy without appointment medical people place work vaccinating people, they're going go way get it.

2. actively avoiding getting shot refuse circumstances.

You get first group get shot right circumstances. second group lot problems with. actively trying get vaccine + first group (and previously infected), pretty close herd immunity without needing active resistors. arm wasn‚Äôt sore unpleasant day half. bad headache, felt weak/achy, little nausea. don‚Äôt know anyone else who‚Äôs don‚Äôt really know response common. Definitely plan taking next day off. almost like TV people counting fear watching keep relevant. click guidance link parent post, there‚Äôs PDF states: ‚ÄúA rare syndrome thrombosis, often cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, thrombocytopenia noted coronavirus vaccination highlighted affecting patients ages genders; present
 clear signal risk factors‚Äù - young women never said that?

And people risk have, now, received vaccine. they're unvavcinated point that's them. lot people never leave country lives desire got first Pfizer shot Wednesday afternoon lot people said didn‚Äôt side effects first one, 24 hours later got hit massive fatigue, headaches, body aches, nauseousness. Feeling bit better today still exhausted headache. Still worth it, course! It‚Äôs quite sad hate EU this. least allow exports unlike pretty Western country. 
They ban exports comes covid programme. 

If want hate, hate AZ. hadn‚Äôt lied production sites (of 4 mentioned contract 1 actually produced EU), capacity (they produced 30% promised!), wouldn‚Äôt happen. 

We getting screwed immoral capitalistic company. South-America Europe. 
I understand, historically speaking, EU dislike said: rejected covid export all. risen. That's fair. Maybe message vaccinated people can't spread instead vaccinated people worry spreading contracting it. 

The point vaccinated people largely safe personally transmission perspective communicating that. provides incentive get vaccinated, important thing right now. everyone 60 years old lost job? better worse. going ignore vaccines exist US excellent job vaccinating people? ""descript"" piece paper?  already works travel vaccines, like yellow fever vaccine. seem problem it. You‚Äôre free say anything you‚Äôd like, doesn‚Äôt mean won‚Äôt face consequences *doubt* tough messaging this.

On one hand, second shot important convey increased immunity.

On hand, plenty studies one shot (talking two shot vaccines) give hearty immunity two weeks after, really quite safe one shot. Hell, everybody England one shot policy.

On hand, spread message hard (""one shot safe"") likely bunch people skipping second shot, absolutely second shot convey increased immunity.

End result... follow actual science studies, know well perfectly safe gather immunized people 14+ days first Pfizer/Moderna shot. However, White House/CDC/Whoever probably correct message continue messaging people wait 2 weeks 2nd dose, sticking single specific consistent message makes people immunized important thing right now. Low risk != risk

It's pretty reasonable say things vaccines effective told. Even though 100 percent true, level risk people's minds. Like worrying car crash every time leave something. You‚Äôre crazy think we‚Äôll need field hospital again. California opening everyone 15th can't see end month realistic first doses I'm guessing high correlation anti-vaxxers people never left America. You‚Äôre ignoring fact even people vaccinated get sick significantly lower viral load dentist apparently moved away, didn‚Äôt know showed appointment completely different guy record appointment despite multiple confirmations ZocDoc We've touchy politics past 12+ years. Close 4M doses US think risk accurate public. say vaccinated people CANNOT transmit virus high profile case happen (which seems likely given 300,000,000 people involved) CDC loses lot credibility people question trust statements make like vaccine safety. nothing wrong saying ""extremely low risk"". There‚Äôs chunk that‚Äôd happy lie vaccination status follow restrictions.

That's seems awfully like worry people hoarding masks/PPE would needed HCW's, public told ""masks work"". focus back then, now, increasing production masks (now) getting people vaccinated quickly possible. opposed dishonest messaging vaccinated people able infect others response? Never thought would say this, can‚Äôt wait subreddit dies! (For obvious reasons)

This last year bit hell policy perspective, pretend like exist. Nothing 100% immunology, population level count widespread vaccination drive viruses negligible levels. Vaccines work. Likely true. employers want site workers, workers either comply find new jobs.

I imagine lots jobs shifting sort location based pay rather good local pay work wherever options. We‚Äôve already got hesitancy kicking south Midwest. think people going surprised people choose get vaccinated fluke it‚Äôs still within 95% confidence interval original results it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot statistically different‚Äù original number.  
Dec analysis: 94.6% vaccine efficacy (95% CI \[89.9, 97.3\]).

Apr analysis: 91.3% vaccine efficacy (95% CI \[89.0, 93.2\]).

e.g 95% CI dropped 7.4 wide 4.2 wide.

My concern South Africa 8 vs 0 100% efficacy 95% CI \[53.5, 100.0\] means could low 53.5% effective (though that‚Äôs unlikely). 3rd party studies probably better data. great news! I've anxious travel eyeing memorial day trip see friends mine vaccinated already.

My dad works travel industry seeing surge bookings summer fall welcome news him. close everyone opportunity. Several states open vaccinations start see demand vaccine drop. smart, we‚Äôd hit college students school. pile people one location logistics would fairly straightforward love it. Newsflash, we're getting everyone vaccinated  People realize covered two weeks first. Congress shall make law respecting establishment religion, prohibiting free exercise thereof; abridging freedom speech, press; right people peaceably assemble, petition Government redress grievances.

Look first word. It‚Äôs ‚Äúargument‚Äù it‚Äôs literally codified right there.  gaps law, etc. 

Anyone saying otherwise clearly know first amendment says. think anti-mask anti-vask people gathering already? think they're sudden going start misinterpreted something CDC? mean, following you. pharmaceutical companies even bother getting FDA Approval? even value getting FDA Approvals anymore?

I reached FDA already forwarding question different departments, maybe get answer next week share here. Yes really think White House guidance going stop behavior? People going whatever want regardless White House CDC say, might well tell truth instead trying manipulate people. think good bill. support Vaccines (get flu shot every year, etc) covid vaccine, heck, even mask mandates. I've wearing masks since mask mandates even existed. trivial inconvenience bear help safeguard fellow man.

However, allowing government require citizens jump hoops (in case, taking experimental medical treatment, knows next?) order government's permission engage every day life extremely worrisome privacy/surveillance civil liberties standpoint. precedents sets really bad. Would need vaccine passport able vote? so, else could government require get vote? on. 

&amp;#x200B;

America county people every corner saying ""Paper's please!"" whether papers immigration naturalization records vaccine passports whatever. 

&amp;#x200B;

This reminds 'no fly list terrorists/suspected terrorists' fiasco. sounds good principle practice quickly becomes clear much morass unaccountable civil liberties violations is.

The money ‚Äì reported region ¬£21 million ‚Äì meant secure vital shipments UK. Brussels threatened ban exports Thursday vowed would ""no negotiation"" Downing Street, insisting doses diverted European nations.¬† 


A leaked letter revealed Oxford scientists urged major EU nation invest Halix factory alongside UK last April, deal never signed.¬†

 
The European Union would likely secured millions AstraZeneca doses Dutch government acted decisively, sources suggested. EU official admitted bloc yet contribute single Euro towards Halix plant.

 
MPs suggested Thursday night Downing Street ask money back. 
Steve Baker, deputy chairman Covid Recovery Group, said: ""We invested plant. contractual entitlements vaccines. EU disagrees entitlements, option going court.

‚ÄúEven worst Eurosceptic moments, would never dreamt EU would behave like this.‚Äù¬†¬† 
The news Britain funded vaccine factory centre EU blockade comes major shortfall AstraZeneca supplies threatens¬†to disrupt successful UK rollout.

GPs told stop administering first doses month¬†and focus vaccine resources primarily awaiting second jabs. Downing Street says UK remains target vaccinate adults July.

The Government entered negotiations EU doses produced Halix plant, gained approval European regulator last week. Sources said factory ready produce five million doses raw vaccine every month. 


But Thierry Breton, EU‚Äôs internal market commissioner, warned ‚Äúzero‚Äù jabs would sent UK AstraZeneca fulfilled commitments Brussels, even Germany suspended routine use AstraZeneca vaccine people aged 60 fears rare blood clots.

‚ÄúIf \[AstraZeneca\] more, don‚Äôt issue, long doesn‚Äôt deliver commitment us, doses stay Europe,‚Äù¬†Mr Breton said. ‚ÄúThere negotiation.‚Äù 
  
Whitehall sources, however, pointed UK guaranteed millions pounds Halix factory April last year, Oxford vaccine proven effective. 
The University Oxford signed deal Dutch firm identifying brand new Halix plant suitable building capacity millions doses.

 
Scientists university approached Mark Rutte, the¬†Dutch prime minister, request 10 million Euros build barrels capable holding 1,000 litres raw vaccine. 
""There probably huge demand vaccines successfully pass tests,‚Äù scientists wrote letter leaked Dutch broadcaster NOS.

 
‚ÄúMost likely, quantities available vaccines limited several months. avoid major delays, production capacity must increased now."" 
But Dutch failed sign deal, despite entering initial talks Halix. failure invest meant EU missed chance secure millions doses itself, sources suggested.

 
On Thursday night EU official admitted bloc yet contribute cash Halix factory. 
‚ÄúWe checked EU funding possibly given Halix EU financial instruments could identify support. prejudge national funding given member states,‚Äù official said. 
 Sir John Bell, regius professor University Oxford, leading figure development AstraZeneca jab, said dealing EU like ‚Äúpulling teeth‚Äù. 
 ‚ÄúIt nightmare, AstraZeneca especially,‚Äù Sir John said. 
 ‚ÄúAnd turn round say jab isn‚Äôt safe. would say time EU make mind up.‚Äù 
  
The stand-off Halix factory complicated Brussels‚Äô demand vaccines two AstraZeneca factories UK, manufacture vast majority AstraZeneca jabs used Britain. 
 commission wants Boris Johnson release AstraZeneca UK contract, gives Britain first refusal jabs. argues EU contract AstraZeneca counts two British plants part EU‚Äôs supply chain. 
 Brussels demanded ‚Äúreciprocity‚Äù UK believes Britain dependent EU supplies vaccines completion vaccination campaign. Twenty million Pfizer jabs exported UK since December, leading sources claim UK success ‚Äúmade EU‚Äù.

UK-EU negotiations Halix supplies expected continue next week. UK regulator yet grant approval, although million doses exported Halix UK clearance December last month. 
 Last week, Ursula von der Leyen, president European Commission, introduced tougher export rules allowing Brussels target countries higher vaccination rates EU low exports EU, like Britain. 
 EU leaders, wary UK could block export raw vaccine materials EU, stopped short explicitly backing plans summit insisted AstraZeneca would fulfil contract allowed export.

 
A spokesman AstraZeneca refused comment. company said Tuesday ‚Äúthe EU supply chain overwhelmingly EU‚Äù. 
A University Oxford spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe aware formal letter sent Oxford University Dutch government. However, vaccine team approach wide range potential funding partners early 2020 partnership struck AstraZeneca.‚Äù chart also wrong -- least New Jersey. [Cases increasing pretty steadily New Jersey‚Äôs seven-day average new cases 3,977, 19% week ago 36% month ago. Thanks reply. right, efficacy still quite high based what's known. Ideally, vaccines would permanent-ish solution expect booster probable.

This finding really ought discussed perspective, rather saying effective 6 months. really sound awful claimed limited. say so. Let's see research.  states (Florida) back normal except big events like concerts, even planned again. aren‚Äôt fully yet, they‚Äôre close.

COVID world-changing event, forever. restrictions phased US course year. Yep slight metallic taste mouth first hours first shot went away. sure. strategy certainly drawbacks misinforming creating covid fatigue others say screw I‚Äôm done this. 

Also making people trust future, since revealed lied (or least misled) control behavior time. when/if say something similar future, even true time, people disbelieve would otherwise case.  Seriously? cry everytime read good news? rude see therapist personally honestly would worry much would get 2nd dose whatever available. think efficacy vaccines similar specifically studied combinations yet. view vaccines really complicated pretty similar do, especially comes severe outcomes really care about. $0.02 I'm amazed people make slightest attempt fact check things posting them. I'll takes one simple search show wrong. People asses get blocked.  don‚Äôt believe that‚Äôs true.  I'm sure mainly risk health vaccine-takers. found mixed bags information. sources say vaccinating asymptomatic might help, might cause vaccine less effective. source say would harm. Another reason could could influence results vaccine. covid tests prior vaccinations, cant sure positive vaccination likely large mass people asymptomatically positive vaccination everything seems fine. Cant say sure imagine actually might boost immune system despite ongoing infection Im specialist draw conclusions, lol. New York going done good soon month stood ""populists"" (whatever think term means), common sense attempt turn vaccination program parade european federalism making ass herself.  
Then presided shit show vaccines kept shelves due bureucracy, constantly changing recommendations get Astra Zeneca vaccine, flip flopping barking mad idea shutting everything, supermarkets included, 4 days. ‚Äúmany‚Äù ‚Äúwill‚Äù ‚Äúserious‚Äù complications

There‚Äôs lot certainty far certain Faster possible I‚Äôm afraid, Norway getting every possible dose approved vaccines. assume delays J&amp;J given production problems mess US. August, things improve lot then. Covid AZ since vaccines market since Germany 20 million 60 Germany go quite without problem besides rescheduling issues days. Hey, sorry go that. Fainting sucks super scary, I'm sure hospital trip could use drug like medics gave me, offset autonomic nervous response

I would talk primary care doctor see say.

I suspect likely would want make accommodations prepare second shot vaccination site - make sure seated receiving vaccine, tell person vaccinating experienced syncope first dose nurse/EMT nearby make sure OK, bring someone stay side make sure fall, make sure receive help whoever comes get vaccination guide seat observed, read vaccinations prevent sickness 6 months anyway.

The news studies showing people vaccinated 6+ months ago first large vaccine trials ago **still protected**, exact opposite ""vaccinations prevent sickness 6 months"". likely provide protection much longer, know long.

Note people protected 6+ months received two doses. know yet, possible one dose, immunity fade faster require get *more shots* future protect you, would really suck, there's way find way feel safe going second shot, would it. What‚Äôs best trick preventing arm soreness shot? Mine always hurts days after. Well festival goers duh lol 6 months? Pfizer honestly trying get people get ""vaccinated"" multiple times per year forever? Lol incredible

Please read following open mind makes zero sense basic stuff

Polio Measles vaccinated specific traits diseases common, target kill younger healthy kids/young adults.

Vaccinations eliminating disease entirely achieving herd immunity. possible shot wears every six moths .. period. 

These vaccines prove it.

Let's say jungle get bit monkey foaming mouth. doctor ask ""how long ago last rabies vaccine?"" 

Never! Lol .. however say

""How long since rabies ""SHOT"" ""BOOSTER"" shot.

Vaccinated required time modifier vaccine.

Rabbies shots require boosters time get bit get another shot. requires follow means called vaccine .. one state Virginia declared would available 16+ April 18.  need read much news. data still limited, 91% efficacy within confidence interval first reported 95% efficiency. may may need one dose booster next year, see. remaining 9% full-blown disease, vaccine still offer protection almost everybody.

If mutants complicate things, looking good. coming cautious realist/pessimist. Spoiler alert, Spanish flu never went away. parts flu vaccine Got mine today üëç Thank Biden. walk appointments usually larger line 

It matter. there's line all, vaccines administered maximum possible rate location. line happens get shorter, people like long lines naturally line up.

The idea vaccinate many people possible. Literally go check source. Type covid deaths us. 

You‚Äôre upset aren‚Äôt happy fact pandemic ending. is. Sorry bothers you. Chances already dose freezer waiting you. would worry it. think body temperature is. logic vaccine would die body. Ever Given blocking Suez Canal. üòú Spanish flu ? would check around, get shot anywhere. got first dose yesterday schedule 2nd, independently. obviously interested getting soon possible.  almost certain mixing vaccines give better protection. Worst case scenario work like one dose Pfizer - around 80% efficacy anyway. may better people vaccinated normally, certainly worse off.  already posted Reposts removed. really simple effective way it. everyone access vaccine, remove restrictions, want engage something puts risk, option get vaccinated. puts responsibility back individual lets everyone else socialize normally. hope others follow suit. Yeah, according side-effect chart. annual booster would choices. Im personally waiting INOVIO's DNA vaccine. side-effects taking vaccines spent money on. banning exports companies fulfilling contracts already paid EU fulfill them.

Stop repeating falsehoods. contracts broken. EU's failures want others pay them. fuck.

I take thing seriously. go without mask basically hermit year. surface-cleaning bullshit?? *respiratory virus.* magically missed articles people getting Covid contactless grocery delivery? No? haven't? any? stop sanitary theater focus masks, ventilation, filters distancing?

Austria: No, like that! wanted ourselves, others.

Edit: clear demands would met, Kurz turned Portuguese plan, would required Austria donate portion share 3 million doses needier nations. Kurz insisted sticking pro-rata formula tried dismantle, would give country more.

That part particularly good must spreading disinformation re: efficacy

Could that, could someone got confused.

Anyway hope figure way get second shot, best luck. ban. Young people still get want to, recommended anymore. AZ adenovirus vector. potential develop immune response vector known risk factor usage adenovirus vectors.

There nothing prevent usage AZ booster hence development variant version, needs carefully deployed used such.  beginning vaccine approved UK, approved EU old people European standards data missing.

A later data, also approved EU.

Now even newer data: significant number side effects young people (primarily young women). Yes, number super low, still big enough talk about.

Chile quickly managed make deals many different labs, got 12 million doses CoronaVac SinoVac Lab beginning January 2 million doses, shipment received 2 millions doses, far received 6 shipments, last one came back March 21st.

We also received Pfizer vaccines smaller numbers.

The vaccination process organized people see go nearest community health center, school wherever Vaccination center located. 

Health workers old people priority first, think got Pfizer, followed people chronic illnesses 65 18 years age, people without condition began receiving vaccine, people work taxi bus drivers, teachers people selected ''Vocales Mesa''(they count votes election) also eligible get vaccine past worst Situation day

That explained easily... **most people getting infected vaccinated yet.** government made really silly decisions, opening schools, malls, giving people vacation permits, people really understand weight situation, care virus ''they young, affect Trust numbers.

I know anecdotal, oh well...

Thing is, got vaccinated yesterday lot people there, parents got vaccinated well. important thing need realize. efficacy rate vaccine nearly important effective preventing hospitalization death. take first vaccine get wait one higher efficacy ones. That's generally agreed upon language medical community. Vaccination immunization two distinct actions. Vaccination applying vaccine subject, immunization vaccine creates desired reaction subject. 

I think get CDC using generalized term: easier describe general public. Explaining intricacies vaccines induce immune response would burdensome confusing folks.

Just make super-clear: fully jabbed. I'll fully protected 2 weeks. Dude dad vaccinated AZ I'm trying book mother well. obtuse I'm saying? strawman argument either. debatelord reason. 

All said people outdated knowledge reported blood clots UK. tried address reported day. true. I'm saying use AZ, I'm saying upfront date know. 

The way responded really worries fuels antivaxx sentiment.  think kickbacks involved FDA-approved (well EUA, actually) vaccines? Thanks. Point taken. üñï also trial experience. Got tested ~3 weeks 2nd shot came back negative COVID antibodies. 3 weeks (so total 6 weeks dose 2) partner got sick COVID. Despite living together spending 24/7 him, never got sick. Wasn‚Äôt surprised late Feb said wasn‚Äôt placebo. 

I never thought go get second test though! Tbh even getting first one felt like cheating system ha There's enough data yet people around world gotten Pfizer. Expectation wise yes, wait data  need inoculation nonsense. I‚Äôll pay top dollar. Haha, ain't though. yoga chance? enjoy inside? really (and going forward) central registry this.

This one cases centralized healthcare system would useful. Lockdowns never end Europe require vaccine isn‚Äôt FDA approved? Nurses allowed refuse flu vaccine  2 months real lockdown (the type place US) far less economic damage indefinite quasi lockdown provide link video saying coronavirus hoax? get migraines well, experience 2nd dose Moderna similar bad migraine. Memorial Day official ‚ÄúFuck shit day‚Äù COVID US. summer going fucking electric. think thought college kids move cities summer want protect families moving back source? Got second Pfizer Tuesday. Sore arm (not sore first one) that‚Äôs it. arm isn‚Äôt least bit sore anymore.

O‚Äô land free, arm brave? Yes. I'm saying there's way FDA allow EUA, road approve without additional studies clotting issues. Thats true also way hospitalizations become dissociated cases, deaths becoming dissociated hospitalization fascinating yet quite sad story. Poor minks, thank sharing. Another example genome sequencing tell focus public health measures even lockdown restrictions - tracking virus long enough, you‚Äôd able follow variant lineage link outbreak. used often enough, great tool learning mistakes failures. 

I understand dissent Danish public time though - issue milk, may needed cull minks.Maybe that‚Äôs corpses began rise graves. jest though - doubt governments would‚Äôve done time. 

I don‚Äôt understand many countries abandoned it.

Aight didn‚Äôt read keep going. Got 1 done J&amp;J today. Side effects suck proud apart number. body better remember immune response lol Oh yeah sure countries easily keep virus others. Considering everything said would agree never possible strategy Germany done well could given that.

GNE tanking 40 would generate delicious loss porn Yeah see that‚Äôs science works dog. Maybe, maybe, they've looned reality detail have. still chose critise EU. Except South Korea zero COVID strategy not. never Norway much outlier part discussion. vaccinating young people Norway vulnerable people dying elsewhere? made allocation decision. Assuming virus keep mutating making strains around, herd immunity chance kill flu managed? bomb shit anyone. super happy! Smile everyone! two countries broke mould continuing persistent genomic sequencing throughout pandemic instead making assumption every country risk posed presence mutations. accident countries first variants concern discovered around time. kismet variants appeared regularly sequencing allowed scientists quickly detect analyse mutations develop understanding characteristics risks posed.

Given rates severe COVID death higher elderly, it‚Äôs reasonable assumption group willing vaccinated. 73.7% vaccinated fantasy, grew 0.2%. Looks like we‚Äôre reaching upwards boundary unless seniors forever reason slow vaccinated.

I find much useful know memory-response processes work. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily great idea non-publicly approved (FDA standards) vaccine administered every 6 months memory-response still adequate prevent infectiousness significant illness among 99% population, least period longer 6 months.

Whats thinking there? bonkers ask people vaccinated keep measures unvaccinated. Unproductive, too. carrot get people get shots. I‚Äôm glad countries really need doses (Latvia, Croatia...) going finally get them.

Also glad scumbag Kurz humiliated. **can** vaccinated covid two short months see zero issue this. article indicates several details make pretty hard argue law excludes healthcare workers offered vaccine work refuse it.

So offered vaccine healthcare workers become ill COVID-19 collect medical expenses lost wages.

The benefit specifically covid-related bill contains exception people medical condition puts risk vaccine.

And there's exception people can't get it.

Assuming exception well enough crafted screwing anyone legitimate reason allowing anyone bullshit reason, I'd say pretty conceptually airtight. offered vaccine, accept it, go F catch covid need help. Ship captains irrational fear water.

Maybe they'll safest ship captain's high seas. want AI nightmare fuel: AI resume scanning. data ones pick ones toss come previous hires and/or performance. means field particularly biased particular nationality/race/gender, default it'll amplify bias data biased. minimum smart enough scrub names, even might correlate schools, addresses, etc etc point reasonable way normalize fake data entirely.

Stop pushing misinformation agenda.  u/MMBbot 5 u/YourWebcam funniest part neighboring states exempt, could go PA NY quarantine. But, lived New Hampshire (which much lower rates), would need quarantine.

Like commenter above, actual feinting vaccinations needle pokes uncommon. yes, probably pain/anxiety related. Best hydrate beforehand go get shot snack.

[How - - u/MMBbot 5 u/lovememychem sister got first Prizer shot today also site, big church, packed too! interesting thanks answering. :) period, Michigan gone 2k 6k day.

But nationally....
March 15: 46,504     
Today: 70,928     

While Michigan may largest increase, theres whole bunch states rising. 

Youre right California, thought drop recent. Lol

It's rather fascinating stuff. decrease deaths made firat appt said proof residence would required never asked it. really disgusting EU behaving. get it, AZ vaccine delayed cost countries lin Africa Latin america whose health care hospitals european resources disgusting. delay COVAX well programs EU trying hoard many vaccines can. finally got appointment April 8 (Pfizer). I'm disappointed frustrated difficult obtain it, glad it. Precisely. wish article actually named could add mutation. Since said South Africa might e484k. someone finds specifically variant mutation name please share it!

**Brazil Mutation Report**
 Updated 22m ago
4,536 comparing deaths general population (hint: mostly people 80) vs risk AZ vaccines people 60 make much sense go insane rant people supposedly understand data ""can't make point"". countries young people died choice really clear cut make sound. made even easier fact AZ doses available begin we're running people 55, 60 65 vaccinate while. yeah, save indignation real problems. Smallpox rinderpest would like word they've eradicated possible. Yes exactly, statistically correct exclude outliers, makes sense, understand general situation. 

One claim worlds far herd immunity vaccinations, excluding Israel. outlier explain global situation. local example might limited effect happening larger picture.

If find small country (let's say Iceland) EU cases tanking exclude analyses still claim cases soaring around Europe ""except Iceland"" bcs cases going outlier, represent situation continent.

If observe something extraordinary 49 states, Michigan; claim Michigan represent happening US. come someone claim unscientific? 

You shall make exclusions people travelling Michigan states numbers play major role initiating wave states, sound highly unlikely tbh.  lot people caught yet going back ""old normal"". new status quo... new normal. People adjust... always do. covid, first dose bit rough. Second cake. seems goes people situation me. Honestly, sub might well called coronavirus fan-fiction. 

I‚Äôm actual scientist expertise virology immunology get downvoted often even posting basic facts immune system. don‚Äôt know even bother anymore. Studies pouring show far less likely contract spread vaccinated.

But comparatively minuscule rate, yes, possible. media reading/watching? EU already relatively small amounts. first time doses delivered UK though Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted that‚Äôs accurate. hitting younger people harder elderly. friend mid 30's feeling like flu one day dose #2. parents felt fine #2. second dose guess 10x ""titers"" something like that. felt close 100% day feeling I'll... Worth it. feel dread go 6 months.

You won't. 

This saying effects last *at least* six months. can't know maximum end protection they've statistically relevant fully vaccinated group six months. know upper bound protection (or if) starts failing first fully vaccinated group people. much worse. got rash Moderna vaccine (only first shot oddly enough). uncommon event. alright days. Said fly spider  HOLD vaccine! SELL Thx efforts dude üíô ones bad immune systems dead bro... Got first shot yesterday, excited life get back normal live? lol promised first vaccine September too. Add months Germany 4th 5th waves. point vaccinating effective without booster that's coming almost year. (because even Sep/Oct, take another half year make people's arms) see you‚Äôre arguing point answer still lol? ‚ÄúYoung people‚Äôs immune system better, plain simple.‚Äù 

Yes‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs recover, gain antibodies, deal sicknesses better later life. 

‚ÄúYou may catch cold you‚Äôve never caught age 55. won‚Äôt hit like covid cold‚Äù 

Maybe, maybe not. know definitely won‚Äôt hit like covid cold? cold I‚Äôve caught child, immune system primed deal learn to. 

There‚Äôs entire books written dude, stop idiot lol got second dose, still getting 5G reception. got second dose Moderna. reaction first dose (mild aches, soreness around injection site, mild fatigue). second dose means milder. Around hours shot (injected around 4:15-30) started feel sort soreness first dose, thought would it. 

I wrong. around midnight, total body aches experiencing woke (I'd say like get flu, worse). aches intensified started get chills, told might fever, around 8 took temperature regularly hitting 100 degrees (Fahrenheit) popped Tylenol went back sleep--already feeling aches fever subside.

Four hours later, breakfast (toast coffee) started feel nauseous--it mild, uncomfortable, lasted around 10-15 minutes. aches began come back fever return around 3:00 PM (with chills). took Tylenol fell asleep.

About another four hours--and hint nausea dinner--at 8:00 PM, fever terrible aches returned again! worried point, took Tylenol knocked hours. 

This time, woke up, felt completely different. could tell body finally calming aches muted and--although still felt warm--I could sense done battling fever.

All all, 8:00 PM (Tuesday) 10:30 PM next day (Wednesday), felt rough--so that's little 24 hours me. 

I asthma pretty bad allergies problems breathing (I stay consistent allergy medication throughout though). felt body aches, minor chills (not heavy, teeth-chattering chills I've illnesses past), twinge nausea (less 15 minutes total), fever never went higher 100-101 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Now, solidly second day, I'm little fatigued injection site remains tender itchy. 

I'd heartbeat! (PS - expecting this, nervous getting second shot almost fell chair lol). Thankfully sat last wave stands still one highest death rates country. 4-12 days, believe. developed country diabetics die simply cannot afford insulin? Fucking shoot already, I'll still mask up; I'll still distance. let part solution.

Name shame! borderline insane people let (healthy) children play (healthy) children without mask on. chance outdoor transmission extremely low, also children somehow seem lower chance getting infected well. People need understand first all; masks worn correctly order effective well. reason much controversy mask effectiveness effectiveness clinical settings. IE healthcare professionals **never** touch masks, also wear slightly thicker masks instance surgeries. I'm halfway med-school long procedure get clinical sterilized environment. Wearing mask improperly good anyone, mask usage children always say need it.  


Yet somehow people still tend listen everything Fauci says, instance, People look all-knowing god, wanting clear definitive answer everything.

""Illinois lift face covering requirement CDC recommends it,"" Pritzker said Thursday. need follow Australia's example make lock downs much harsher. Beware diving comment section: anti-vax trolls force here. quicker eliminate covid better world be. Getting vaccines produced would go long way achieving goal. Human behavior seasonal. main position ""there's guarantee vaccinated keep spreading virus"".

Can‚Äôt spread can‚Äôt get it. Amazing simple conclusion can‚Äôt reached someone lieu getting attention social media going narrative. seems like common sense approach lifting restrictions, I'm ashamed many states going take things much further. Maybe - it'll interesting see vaccine campaigns developing countries go, much uptake boosters. There's evidence coronaviruses may started pretty deadly, too, become less developed immunity (notably theory Russian flu 1880s actually emergence OC43). becomes case here, could see us bothering much vaccination future letting circulate common cold. Time tell, either way safe say eradicating anytime soon.  larger population study started phase 3 trial late July. Supreme Court could say override state Court say legislature rescind powers since that's state constitution.

Even Supreme Court follow law written, legislature remove emergency powers now. Thank you! certain point, get small % practice zero. get amount severe illness 0.01% people basically one, fall category really unfortunate. 

It's like playing powerball. realistically zero % chance winning extremely fortunately.

I‚Äôm Toronto, god knows I‚Äôm sick lockdowns much anyone, think it‚Äôs fair say biggest frustration back forth, last minute notice (the poor restaurants!), fact public health teams screaming concerns top lungs weeks avail. 

I‚Äôll obviously keep trucking (and assume others slightly higher level grumbling), that‚Äôs what‚Äôs really going here, whatever right wing undoubtedly putting spin political grenade. 21 days ideal believe long within like 10 weeks something, still fine article sharing government funded mRNA vaccine research, letting rest world (or rather accurately China Russia) make copies western developed covid-19 vaccines. six months six months data far, genius. got mine people around gotten well. ones seems hesitant super healthy living folks. say well eat right work get vaccine.  Yeah that's problem here. reeks cowardace.


Believe me, I'm anyway favor Governors emergency powers fucking year, that's laws intended used, legal recourse courts it, states ability reign via legislature.

So response perceived use law used illegal way, getting court dirty work? put perspective Imagine US gave 300 vaccines per minute since pandemic starter Counting someone ""recovered"" automatically certain amount time exclusive profit healthcare. thing Ontario. 2 weeks case automatically considered resolved. honestly think going paying year long lockdown vax?

Caribbean Dec take test 72 getting leaving. they're registered permanent residents countries may stuck Given know efficacy single dose 2 weeks, aren‚Äôt prioritizing first doses? what? would even question? Two reasons. 

1. trials designed way FDA going recommend people use vaccine. confidence interval around one dose formal trial fairly large.

2. terms immunity durability good reason believe second dose increase duration immunity. Duration immunity one dose well studied yet. 

This said, think reasonable thing countries severe vaccine limitations US ample supply vaccine think really changes much. 20 years since last major wave ska; feels like we're due 4th wave new generation finds it. 

Wait, talking about?

Really worry mixed group, unvaccinated people spread other. think everyone mothers subreddit already knows that, it‚Äôs it‚Äôs tedious write ‚Äú4 million reported administered doses today‚Äù

Still, agree newspaper shouldn‚Äôt that. April catch-up month doses switch required 2nd jabs, trade-off our, admittedly hugely successful, delayed jab intervals. unlikely would see significant boost anyway, luckily infections deaths dropped massively longer pressure.


It disappointing longer see usual excellent 1st jab numbers, looks like plan worked take win. Although would obviously love Moderna Novavax already going keep 1st jabs going. symptomatic? point, hell listening Dr. Fauci? Get tested. Check see safe get vaccine covid. 

If indoor facility, go. 

if drive-through outdoor clinic, would still go. double mask, wear gloves them. don‚Äôt post bullshit link sources?

The link contains sources payments. people resort insults lies exposed. US pay 2.1 billion Sanofi. pledge actual payment. deliberately spreading lies piss EU, like guys done 50 years. always backfires end. ""covid-21"" ü§£ü§£  Bloomberg says 2.99 long enough indeed strong enough consistently inject intra-muscular? No, ‚Äúdiscriminates‚Äù people refuse participate important public health initiative. 

I fucking tired Reddit conflating every issue racial/class thing. people color working class people going get vaccinated. Meanwhile Ontario... epidemiologist, make sense me.

If find two cases, connected, know isolating would high chance putting stop spread.

If find two cases, connected, means probably got cases simply find yet.

What's worse, finding 2 ants house, heading hole?

Or finding 2 ants, taking food different direction? think generally behavior meh across US. floated around R0 1 year, terrible virus without mitigations R0 2. 

But like Herman Cain, facts back up. Except individual behavior aggregate mostly drives infections. Mandates basically pushed meh behavior around.

EDIT: unlike Herman Cain I'm dead. think actual name btw. Anyway, googled him. see he's doctor twitter probably overly cautious?

I wondered sort story I'm exact opposite people talking try completely clueless touch. Isn‚Äôt 3 million already ? seems like paid solution businesses use screen employees.  auto immune disease travel lot non covid times. wife‚Äôs work sends covid people home two weeks pay. I‚Äôm curious whether anti-vaxxers works dedicated cause they‚Äôre willing lose pay look like unreliable idiots times year. 

Might even need passports people money power really start throw weight around. Ok thank you. look it. sure contact do. sure talking about. Pfizer J&amp;J **huge** pharmaceutical space. fact *have* heard good news vector vaccines. Look UK AstraZeneca vaccine. bet farm it, technically effective there, going work enough people receive it. US, Pfizer Moderna ahead curve, simply happened best. That's dominated. Johnson Johnson supply issues, rollout limited far. J&amp;J approved Dec like others, would probably discussed.

The reality mRNA vaccines future, goal viral vector inactive virus vaccines use developing parts world. need discount already vaccinated though. u/Americans still winning? desperately hope Dr. Fauci correct. comparative ignorance, fearful.  Brazilian feel great shame, country bottom well denialism, people making genocidal parties president power, I'm wanting international help asking intervention U.S. power happens level system Nazism want trial Nuremberg government Bolsonaro Gotta wait stability data, matter many people got it, hold 25-37C wait. would private businesses requiring government overreach. arm wayyyy less sore first time, switched arms go around. think you‚Äôre fine. I‚Äôve heard lot people say zero side effects second dose. Everyone different. What's point getting vaccinated going live normal life afterwards? trying jerk. Go live, dude. think every parent school age child offered vaccine. They're essentially second line infection behind school staff themselves. think handling consequences children spreading virus realistic, effective, helpful solution closing school every time someone gets infected.

I'm still position principle reason closing schools prevent spread. benefit children risk severe illness less probable getting car accident way school. close schools child gets infected flu- Even advise parents keep kid home- vaccination effort proceeds becoming ridiculous close schools here. would actually say most. qualified live next border, sometimes system tells go state next-door  matter, deliver 40k first two weeks April us. 17.6 people. one them! got first shot today. Wife got first yesterday. bro got second today. Herd immunity come! suppose US wants stick protocol since they‚Äôve got enough vaccines. Perhaps prioritized giving first doses would start administering fewer doses every day.

Still, think delay second doses least hit 70-80% vaccinated 50+ group. seems worked wonderfully UK legitimate privacy concerns showing evidence vaxxed enter certain businesses depend large gatherings people? I'm seriously asking, honestly can't think one. glad decisions made epidemiologists redditors. common people power lockdowns society would shitter right now. hoping I‚Äôd get mine mid July. 

Ended getting last Monday. know exact numbers Germany Q2. 16.7 mil doses AZ 8.35 mil complete vaccinations. population 83 mil 25% =~20 mil people 60 dont see problem using AZ vaccine older people. distribution EU proportional population extremely young countries would significant stock vaccines left. 60 million Novavax ordered top 40m Pfizer, 17m Moderna, 30m J+J. total ~400m vaccines various types ordered approx 60% adult population already received one. UK also seen anywhere near blood clotting issues Europe uptake approval AZ vaccine high. think pretty clear 17 cases single week (or 25, there's 22 overall), issue appears data collection.

Additionally, indicated twice women likely almost exclusively affected, sure. first 5 cases UK men. fact, CSVT generally affects women (theorised pill), fact affected men unusual. think businesses importantly airlines start require passports liability. good thing. better not, keeping borders open first dosage cut transmissions clear, asymptomatic transmission infected individuals pre-symptom. **are infected, shown symptoms yet.** incubation period.

According results, partial immunization 80% effective. 

I think person lying. Partial immunization strong! There's reason UK decided go single shot everyone strategy instead US, 2 shots everyone strategy. necessarily better, shown effective strategy UK dramatically decreasing transmission. Tbf, everyone's messages bad time last year.

Cautious accurate think. administration problem erring side caution, last always presented aggressive timeline. Yep! I'm first dose, get second 2 weeks. wife entire family fully vaccinated. 

We're going gathering Sunday feel comfortable I'm person ""half vaccinated"". Hi All,

&amp;#x200B;

I scheduled get 1st Pfizer dose tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

On Tuesday evening started get annoying tickle throat (not sore, felt normal), slept poorly. Wednesday throat stayed same, evening started feel tired. Yesterday throat same, also got diarrhea. However, yesterday evening diahrrea went away, morning woke throat feeling fine, diahrrea still bit tired. still feeling bit weak. tested, symptoms extremely mild.

&amp;#x200B;

Do guys think fine get shot tomorrow? Yes exactly Personal insults, another dead giveaway argument.  God something? know future something? Man world turning dumb...  Ya, funny story that... well, funny. frightening time. 

I found N95 rated mask, big face, put mushed tight cloth mask onto face make sure gaps mask. small pimple corner mouth morning, didn‚Äôt think even think mask rubbing area hour. Well...

Within hours coming home grocery store, bump got bigger, red, seemed multiply. much worse three days later go walk clinic. scary.. obviously, take mask show doctor. 

She gave topical cream. took maybe 2 weeks heal. 

Never tried mush mask face again. üò¨üò∑  listen range independent scientists understand different arguments biases create them. 

The current ""Should tell people vaccination largely prevents spread"" question matter policy vs. science. science says vaccination largely prevents spread, that's probably good policy. Name brand association probably plays part comfortable Johnson &amp;johnson Pfizer knew names pre covid it‚Äôs really rational that‚Äôs So, people lied bc someone going misinterpret/ignore message? really think ""unvaccinated dumbasses"" (as say) following protocol anyway?!?! let people make decisions treat like adults are. Yes, less smart decision making, value everyone's right make informed decision. Cases also rising MN, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll hit awful exponential growth phase, hopefully lighter restrictions work time Also pretty hard fourth wave we've one single big wave. second third wave. People stupid allow trough without vaccines. knows lol. I‚Äôve friends (I‚Äôm 29) say felt like crap second dose Pfizer Moderna. Personally felt okay each, bit weather mainly sore arm. can't tell trolling genuinely illiterate I've said million times I'm fine continuing emphasize two points:

* need everyone even almost everyone get vaccine. CDC estimates around hundred million Americans infected. Infection yields immunity. People want vaccine likely care health measures restrictions anyway, they're largely getting immunized lethal means. able carry us herd immunity even can't hit 80% Americans vaccinated.

* big reason many people need vaccine overly cautious messaging public health restrictions still apply vaccinated people. Yes, they've slowly changing attitude it, yes there's concern people could lie say they're vaccinated excuse wear mask- poses two problems. one arguing CDC right advise restrictions people protected dishonest justifications. dishonesty keystone point many anti public health arguments, continuing dishonesty problem. Second, people want vaccine going lie wear mask probably wearing mask first place. really think making big deal would relatively small problem, consequence continued apathy virtue dishonesty. That's problem. Exactly. got vaccine last Monday, I‚Äôve pretty much quarantined since. chance I‚Äôm catching shit two weeks takes body build first round antibodies. freedom want temporary safety!!

^(Someone deserves nether.)  Thanks Indiana relate much. couple months ago visited aunt cousin vaccinated. invited inside see new pups felt paranoid conversed inside maybe 6 feet apart wherein one wearing mask.

Anyways. Glad able get first shot yesterday! This; got second shot past Monday. want go sit restaurant, keep reminding wait least 14 days more. could used sanitizing similar facilities libraries, temples, churches, cinema houses, etc.. etc. going seasonal, would peak every winter, summer. part year initial wave happened pretty irrelevant. 

It's like covid follows patterns cosmos, migratory birds something. actual underlying reasons cases winter. going follow annual anniversary. anyone allowed travel Brazil? ignoring impact herd immunity. 90% effective enough reach herd immunity, 10% could possibly spread quickly become irrelevant 90% people can't.

Sure, it'll absolutely helpful long run, need stay diligent then. reason CDC saying ""vaccinated people can't spread virus"" know would encourage people throw caution wind. can't rely herd immunity actually *have* herd Probably need 50% fully vaxxed drop restrictions considering much natural infection have.

Yeah, I'll wait expert opinion I'm hopeful, especially vaccine hesitancy continuing fall. I'm excited gatherings friends family everyone vaccinated, even moreso going public. pointless. good traveling still take precautions go testing returning? even care think? Reddit hivemind wrong lot things, stance site sub change day. Look sub‚Äôs stance Cuomo instance. third language, sorry. There, clearly stated argument. follow saying understand they‚Äôre going here, college students otherwise cause lot spread may end net deaths neglecting them. it‚Äôs like they‚Äôre vaccinating college students. risk people continue vaccinated, supply devoted college students well. got Johnson Johnson today! know works strains emerging? took could get never fe li relief complaints. story pandemic problem vaccine rollout solution yet. statement true NATO exporter vaccines countries EU.

I think always true. Eventually, hopefully sooner rather later, America begin exporting vaccines.

You need understand something. Biden (or least people) already eye win 2022 midterm elections. He's great start public vaccine rollout, COVID economic relief big ""rebuild America's infrastructure &amp; pay taxing rich"" plan. long screw 3 things up, chances good Democrats well midterms able continue good 2023-24.

Let's go back vaccine rollout. want imagine two alternate scenarios, eye toward U.S. elections 2022 2024:

A) Biden sticks current U.S. vaccine priority plan vaccinate many Americans possible. July 2021 willing U.S. adults received shots, opening us begin exporting vaccine Canada countries. 2022 elections -- year later point -- Canadian adults shots too. Heartened vaccine rollout's success, immune factual claims prioritized foreign citizen lives Americans, Democratic Party posts net wins 2022 Biden continue good work.

A) Biden changes U.S. vaccine priority plan enable foreign exports quickly. Critics Republican Party lackies conservative media (Fox News, OANN, NewsMax etc) immediately attack Biden ""America First"" enough, begin speculating so, e.g. take bribes them? (I realize bribes took place; met Republican Party? They'll lie anything everything.)

Because change priority, takes extra 6 months vaccinate willing U.S. adults, meaning end Q4 instead Q2. interceding 6 months, X thousand Americans die COVID Republicans blame Biden them. next year's midterm elections, blame American deaths due COVID dogs Democratic Party, Republicans take back control Senate &amp; possibly House. second half Biden's term pure gridlock, Biden's re-election 2024 threatened. (Yes, certain number Canadians foreign citizens stay alive scenario, compared scenario A. Canadians vote here, U.S. election purposes, Democrats would get credit lives saved.)

--------------------

Addressing US willing give personal freedoms bit longer

Again, met Republican idiots? willing give personal freedoms protect lives. Much less Americans' lives, much much less lives non-Americans. like gotta honest admit they're &amp; going case Article 5 NATO gets triggered?

I could take minute Google referring to, I'm going keep real acknowledge everyday life, know Article 5 is. Care explain total deaths current deaths,

How define current would vaccine safe lifes now, Viriginia Ontario ICs peak usage?

Offered respect: vaccine cure. Ontario people ICUs still whether allow vaccine exports not. vaccine prevent Ontarions contracting say: make foreign policy enable it.

Oh really? Well then, put shoes. average American citizen, modest resources &amp; real access power (except voting noted), would differently bring changes want see world? tested Lancet ( English journal)

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* vaccines create spike protein give protein antibodies. read specs test it'll tell testing for. referring CDC making recommendations only. Governments always impose rules foreign travel. Even pandemic health requirements travel certain places. patient number

my actual vaccine card patient number lol. Let virus burn rather vaccinate avoid escape variants?

Have ever read Luria-Delbruk (or subsequent genetics studies evolution therapeutic resistance)?

If let virus burn population, creates, say, 1 million infections area, unmitigated one vaccinated, lots replication per infection. 1 million infections, create tons mutations possibly functional variants, exist population, dominant. apply vaccine variants go away, ""jackpot event"" variants happen characteristics allow vaccine escape emerge.

Compare mitigating outbreak vaccination campaign. fewer infections fewer replications per infection. Already got much lower chance creating variants begin with. effect eliminating viral interference similar viral strains bringing fitter variants forefront? Yes, dwarfed lower replications vaccinated individuals lower number infections general.

Obviously best approach extinguish once, letting virus run rampant applying vaccine lesser two evils talking chances creating variants escape vaccines. time Young vaccination much data get vaccinated ever want. hesitation go away. Yes, would. know people situation wouldn't, feel safe it. still wear mask everywhere public continue follow restaurant/store rules (bc I'm ass bc people idea vaccination status is), personally think data shows vaccinated individuals safe. Vaccine Experience: 

1st dose, side effects except super sore arm like 2-3 days site location. Maybeee tiny almost noticeable headache like 10 seconds lol.

2nd dose, nothing. even sore arm.

Is odd? mean like, literally felt like nothing happened second one. Worried dose actually get injected. types allergies. Obviously check doctor, type exceptions risk vaccine greater covid. also everyone else get one. enough people immunity, protected too. Even 20 year old healthy people get vaccinated even personally low risk. ‚ÄúIt said cases among aged 30 59 surged start year mid-March pace nearly double national average 316%. age groups saw deaths jump least 317%, compared 223% Brazil whole.‚Äù

Guess forgot read far article you? take Tylenol otherwise contraindicated Yeah I‚Äôm waiting numbers well. believe id like see graph. Young people always hospitalized disease, lower rates. understand can't completely exclude crazies society. Ahhhh really want see happen US... someone clarify, finding lots mixed info.

Is true vaccine effective 6 months, go get another one? Ok, don‚Äôt listen anyway might well tell truth right? little integrity never hurt anybody. Well long Dr. Fucking Fauci says so. people higher need getting first.... wrong? ""big dr man say must true"" 
this celebrity worshipping BS ought banned submitted BLA yet mean Pfizer (or others) ""working towards approval."" course working towards approval via continued trials data collection. 

What's confusing position trusting FDA skeptical it. said know goes drug getting full FDA approval. That's really what's heart questioning. despite willing blindly accept FDA grants full approval, drug safe effective. Well, FDA case determined Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J demonstrated sufficient safety efficacy granted EUA. cases FDA saying okay take drug. never cared went calculus before, sudden care now? You‚Äôre right Trump administration‚Äôs laziness cowboy attitude resulted way deaths necessary. No. like Mr whitty stay EUA phase 4 trials complete, measuring long term immunity. could take years, matter someone like me. Imo still using men 50 since risk/benefit favourable. Yup, suspect percentage going go get younger. I've seen different numbers, suffice say vaccine hesitancy pretty darn significant. plenty empathy. believe others agency making decisions them. Believing decide people lack empathy. work tech well. employer tries force it, real easy go work employer doesn't. 500,000 people die EVERY year smoking, that's perfectly acceptable apparently. Cool, heard that. assumed like virus, could still get pass another person even get sick.

Just checked CDC website says, effect, we're still learning vaccines affect spread still take precautions know more. Explain vaccinating college students ‚Äúthe science,‚Äù then. Construct proper argument. dunno truly outcompete B117, could ride alongside maybe get like 30/70 split. 

Seems like P1 nasty though. :( think messaging little fixated 5-6 week gulf first shot 14 days second shot. *Some* people catch spread virus period, vast majority people won‚Äôt variety reasons (they partially protected, people still follow rules, still restrictions public spaces, there‚Äôs guarantee exposure even engage risky behavior).

Most people still getting sick unvaccinated, messaging needs ‚Äúsit tight another months it‚Äôs turn.‚Äù Instead messaging constantly obsessed idea somewhere millions mostly vaccinated people things shouldn‚Äôt another days.

I‚Äôm shot 2 plus 12 days. I‚Äôm expecting start glowing green second it‚Äôs exactly 14 days. Can‚Äôt read shit like person spews irritates shit stresses moronic people platform times.

Removed facebook phone months ago purpose people friends list spreading bullshit America took challenge. Lol seriously that's argument? K bro Way go üá∫üá∏ huge travelled work prior covid, like 160 days year road. I‚Äôve done 12 days one emergency trip since covid started, forced quarantine after. kept policy, I‚Äôd wholly unable job way used to. 

I‚Äôd 2-4 day trip, 2 weeks, it‚Äôs functional all. Got first Pfizer shot yesterday feel great except arm still bit sore. Around long expect last? know many mutations much can/will around year. 

It's like completely new thing though. None 6 human coronaviruses known infect shown mutate significantly often. Yes. early mid-way socially. Oh people going calling asshole anything fun rest eternity people love something shame people about. speak everyone obviously think point collectively longer wait better we're off. think 20%, everyone hears ""partial"" immunity day 14 compared full immunity day 30+ people collectively put guard day 14 possibly leading un-needed infections. 

Its exactly like strict 6-8 week global lockdown would drastically changed path pandemic compared 3-4 week shut down-ish bulk population still free movement. waited *JUST LITTLE LONGER* untold amount lives could saved I‚Äôm trying point also refuse provide actual source, yet berate guy so. know true, course, insist condescending instead insist others providing link. You... Can't asking straight face, you? Happens regularly work - we've got ""Please wear mask"" sign people think they're making kind civil disobedience statement chin diaper. Thanks, really take weight shoulders. sure that‚Äôs hard people comprehend. need vaccinations everyone first. 

Everyone first befor why? needs fair chance. 

Wear mask social distance till get vaccine. you‚Äôre two weeks removed form fully vaccination carry life guess people quit tasks 80% figure good enough.

If they‚Äôre vaccinated complete task? Ehh people vaccinated? I, agree needing produce passport visit foreign country bit different needing one buy groceries? Sad deliberate incompetence prairie provinces hurting entire nation. Yeah end, think majority get people fence leaning bit anti-vax territory swayed see effectiveness continued safety vaccines. 

I think sporting events northeast going require either proof vaccine recent positive test bet push die hards various teams get shot rather get tested frequently. 

Other people see form control, etc. Lol it‚Äôs anything but, 16% people vaccinated States, please don‚Äôt fool Lol cdc, who, hhs, every where... Lol good argument mental giant Well think mind set ‚Äúyou wait till covid dies down, data comes vaccines‚Äù 0.006%? Less one one thousand? symptom onset day, though say explicitly. ""Incidence"" defined symptomatic COVID confirmed positive test. safe family travel parents vaccinated kids still young? since kids seem affected bad? Plus might well keep flu numbers down. far higher number vaccinated people. Germany reported - far currently aware - 33 cases 2 mil vaccinated ppl.

One info missing cases showed first second shot. equally distributed. Would particularly interesting see uk data, least Germany almost person risk group vaccinated 2x az.  Source? Scott Goettlieb right said April US would open everyone keep pace. people said youngsters would gotten fall. Im listening Michael Osterholm Covid Update, he‚Äôs cautioning 4/5 world (lower income countries) going hot beds variants emerge, inevitably arrive shores time threaten efficacy vaccines. Remember pandemic means effects whole world. hope don‚Äôt lose sight I‚Äôm finally able get vaccinated good luck trying find stock appointment. 

I‚Äôm high risk (my lungs shot) it‚Äôs frustrating. I‚Äôm going die pandemic; wish people took seriously. Thanks tip, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve tried brand. yeah, it‚Äôs honestly big deal, I‚Äôm lady quite particular skin ;) Lol science say people 40 almost risk death? counting kids part population this? can't get even really need effect kids miniscule. 

Counting adults roughly 1% getting first dose every day. probably UK inject category group presenting issue (under 50). They‚Äôre fully vaccinated... it‚Äôs normal life use mask-over-chin I'm outdoors pull go inside business passing large crowd. convenient pulling pocket. would wear mask ordering food takeout restaurant though ü§∑ always statistic me. Well I'm fucked. blood test results 2 days ago.

HDL: **24mg/dl**

Triglycerides: author really shit job showing he‚Äôs wrong... far he‚Äôs right wrong, this. People don‚Äôt write hit pieces nut jobs. Take downs like go truth tellers. source ‚Äúthe science,‚Äù don‚Äôt get point fingers. hard there‚Äôs like 10 listened webinar title highly misleading general ideas saying. Essentially, live thousands Covid deaths per year next 1-2 years period risk new variants could potentially cause deaths society tolerate. modelling predicts 30,000 deaths winter, society may agree reintroduce masks limit attendance big sporting events etc. Based yesterday's performances Jays Rangers, probably half right. I'll surprised 25k show start game half gone 3rd.

As side note, one highlights baseball fandom Odor punching Joey Bats smug face. Even Texas saying get fucked masks? Lol. didn‚Äôt sore arm, 6 hours got low fever muscle aches/chills. felt find next day though. take lungs now, gills come next week. weird, super efficient health system fetishize. shut economy every year due flu. covid we're vaccinated. think backfire places. get low attendance. open adults vaccinated, questions asked. Nah, we'll find way keep relevant 2025 since love twiddling thumbs home.

April Fools. vaccines rolling we're defanging COVID need something new scary sell clicks :) problem there's trials anti-scientific reporting bias media companies regarding vaccines blatant. Caution lunacy.   Yeah, people cause vaccine escape failing marshmallow test writ large, I'm going absolutely livid. literally double 4 8 two days. mean anything statistically? took decades eradicate smallpox. may well eliminate COVID future time, absolutely put society hold happens. really good thing put /s I've seen people say nearly verbatim. say though, pandemic anything unprecedented. society multiple similar scenarios well documented recorded. addition, immunologists medical researchers sounding alarm coming years. Yet large percentage still acts like unbelievable. I've seen posted three times already, mind one bit. plastered everywhere people know variants overblown least stopped burning ‚Äúcolored people‚Äù, it‚Äôs step forward that... baby steps people, baby steps. southern states like toddlers gotta lead hand modern times sometimes. Really? share? produce vaccines rely AZ

They produce spent money it. really dislike arguments see ""covid passports"". legitimate argument I've seen fact tiny minority people can't get vaccine due health reasons, pretty easy accommodate within idea anyway (by giving exceptions legitimate excuses).

The main argument, regards ""freedoms"", opinion absolute bullshit. understand many people seem believe American ""freedom"" means freedom whatever hell want *free consequences*. free dumbass get vaccine. one going physically force arm, ever. we're free exclude virulent ass society response. Funny thing ""freedom"" - everyone else free screw right back, like free screw us participating solution. 

Not get political, thing ""cancel culture"" crap. personally think ""cancel culture"" pretty dumb, lot way-too-sensitive fools getting way-too-offended time, seriously overreacting. HOWEVER, conceptually, problem behavior either side. free asshole say something lots lots people like, people free bully right back response. That's freedom works, neither side's freedom infringed on. free please. 

So Fox News hosts screeching FreeDumbs 4 hours straight every night really missing point estimation. everyone whining vaccine passport infringing theirs. Indianapolis tooooo terrible. 

Everywhere outside Indianapolis hand... Absolutely, government forked billions get vaccines developed. already common knowledge really smart. live college town majority cases coming two universities right now. Vaccinating college students next move states opened 40s 50s. Wish would.   rely AZ

It American problem point still stands, relying AZ export ban situation would much similar.

No. America separate production sites. I'm 60 second today. Co worker 50's signed last week.  Wife teacher last month. Ohio surprisingly right. Call crazy look like potential prequel EON FLUX? Actually J&amp;J beat it‚Äôs March target, regardless saw headlines. Still though, could used 15M doses. I‚Äôve never argued otherwise. cant vaccinate everyone 6 months cant get rid good? mean google it. company prepared everyone needing day second vaccine giving full pay time missed. close contact got 2 weeks full pay. US here. maybe idea talking about. Ever ponder that? Getting cells produce proteins spikes alone, perpetuity kill switch, hopes promoting formation neutralizing antibodies alone foresaking memory cell formation letting body mount immune response viral payload well receptor proteins. virus actually infects cell expresses peptide fragments host cell's membrane cells recognize. so, thusly arrows quiver stop replication infection: sterilization neutralizing antibodies immune mediated cell death via macrophages. also nice bonus cells expend cellular energy/ATP producing receptor proteins (that body already identified forign) forever, thus provoking (now auto)immune response for, well... ever. 

But fuck me, right? I'm confidently stupid, probably idea Spanish flu survivors still exhibited immunity 80-90 years later. probably never even heard ADE. Good day sir/ma'am. think OP talking current rate, total. Every 37 seconds someone western world dies venous thromboembolism (VTE). Source: Well certainly encouraging. Thanks posting actual source...so much misinformation there. ""Herd Immunity"" depends contagious virus is. virus contagious ""Herd Immunity"" high. Oof. getting paid four hours wages per shot, whether work hours Yeah. long haul /s. :) April fool! injected full blown hepatitis! Cross's red glare

The vaccinations right there


Gave proof night


That flag still Yet travel South Africa 21k active cases, remains suspended - unless suddenly changed point. active cases weren‚Äôt much higher ban instituted subsequently even *extended*. Ireland active cases AFAIK I‚Äôm fairly certain SA variant already - test quarantine?  stay shorter amounts time die rates.

Hrmm read opposite - stay longer . like junk mail. 20,000 tons cheap Chines tat. delayed days, think survive that. like influenza

This claim popularized West laypeople, media, certain politicians one remembered SARS seemed understand pneumonia transmit virus

The scientific claim children (kids 12) transmit virus *easily* teens adults, far proven true many scientific studies. Somehow, media laypeople heard transformed children *can't spread virus all*, obviously falsehood.

A lot claims come scientists all, taken statements made scientists morphed something else entirely. recent misunderstanding around well vaccines reduce transmission perfect example. Earliest estimate I‚Äôve heard clinical trials done older kids end August.

Adults consent risk way kids can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs lot easier research them. Bring data!!! please! believe big chain Pharmacy use Pfizer Moderna (3 4 week vaccine intervals) made appointments 4 weeks apart much easier scheduling purposes. 4 weeks Pfizer fine. big chain pharmacies plans/systems vetted CDC part distribution network, it‚Äôs approved! Funny thing I'm America! live saudi arabia, vaccine situation surprisingly awesome. Probably helps I'm.white tho. ok non-placebo group.. rate re-infection? consent form number clinic administered shot, that's number called. would incensed peoples' kids wearing masks? others right comment language, important. judging comment all, CDC defines ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù as

People considered fully vaccinated:

2 weeks second dose 2-dose series, Pfizer Moderna vaccines, or

2 weeks single-dose vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson‚Äôs Janssen second dose! Quite literally ""makin go"" Jaja april fool got really. We've definitely made mistakes like opening Christmas fourth lowest incidence rate Europe moment. Butt chugging oxygen edition. got first dose yesterday! know true heard someone say South Africa variant. honesty though, ones knows point. Michigan leading way variant testing US think actually. follow Lauring lab (virology) UM Twitter tweeted thread this. said time, weeks ago, UK variant know 20% ish cases driving new surge factor. UM research medical academic community.

Very curious happens brazil variant agree. I'm surprised 24 hour vaccine site. didnt' even testing. Signing pretty easy hours usually working hours weird locations. need get day off. That‚Äôs fucked. job allowing two half days getting vaccine. doc Germany claimed 31 people developed blood clots AZ vaccine several died. 191 per 100k, thats oddly specific number. wonder came 200 150. come round number multiplied total population Utah either wear mask now. pandemic. pandemic, wear mask.

Don't demand mask everywhere end time. mask up, personal choice. I'll respect it. demand also wear mask. tend really watch death trend gets optimistic really showing past trends.....what want keep eye future trends indicators.  Positivity rates, hospitalization rates, etc. Leave Walensky needing clarify give idiots like Eric Feigl-Ding ammunition spread malicious nonsense. need command anything.

WTF Well not? ""I'm board"" that's stopped reading post. Yes good point, lockdown whereas right we're open. 20 K less cases/day goal equate maximum 200 deaths/day manageable peak. Source? sort evolutionary pressure possible takes years, immediate process. Arkansas sure seems like burn things publicly still. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* change mind next week.  Literally, ton congressmen still vaccinated. ~25% house refused vaccination, initial point crap start with.

So, huge chunk problem messaging: People presuppose don‚Äôt follow guidance.

Source: Thing way less likely spread virus vaccinated, opening free movement makes easier non-vaccinated people same. certain amount vaccinated need vaccinated people remain careful remaining unvaccinated people mass spreader events. Variant invasion? lmao work media, you‚Äôre good buzz word fear mongering. Colds flu almost non existent year, think anything different regard since months ago. guess Trump right along. It‚Äôll gone Easter No...the Mayo Clinic completed study, Israel study Pfizer, UK now. Pfizer probably approved adolescents May/June, younger children generally don‚Äôt spread COVID.

As much surprises say, pandemic really close US. Maybe create bracelets prove vaccination, ones put trains taken somewhere ""exclude"" them. point stop ‚Äúdiscrimination‚Äù start ‚Äúthe natural results choices group people‚Äù.

If minorities &amp; working class people opportunity get vaccinated upper class white people, policy focuses vaccination discriminatory? 

(And I‚Äôm opposed domestic vaccine passports logistical basis/think unnecessary time it‚Äôs implemented) would depend entirely size population examining. talking 10, 100, yeah strong link. 1000? 10000? 100000? 1000000? much. idea specifics numbers talking about, what's post. No, people listen White House also misinterpret CDC says. one changing behavior statements white house. people understand nuance implications CDC saying people follow anyway. Eligible...but way get fucking appt *Cries delco* study yet, Covid. US started one week ago. trust turtle, I've read Facebook dangerous one! first Moderna shot. Mild headache slightly sore arm 8 hours later. 24 hours shot, sore arm, chills, extremely tired. Feel asleep mid conversation girlfriend. Okay guidance vs policy. CDC like, ""Yo safe scientific knowledge gucci"" Yeah could travel helpful businesses others deciding safely do.

Yeah changes nothing like, reviewed scientific evidence safe No, absolutely wrong. Stop spreading misinfo Dammit, sure exception rule Churchill, Twain, Lincoln etc quotes! 

Into pile goes rest misattributions...still pretty sure he‚Äôs first said ‚ÄúLive, Love, Laugh‚Äù though. matters hard guideline set continuously manipulated pushed back No. must continue follow restrictions. lifted everyone gets theirs. whole lot unvaccinated dumbasses read ‚Äúthe pandemic stop careful now.‚Äù

Except people going regardless cdc says. people going full yolo listening cdc guidelines, never have. it'll absolutely helpful long run

We're going half population vaccinated end May. long run thing, we're hitting herd immunity summer. No, public health experts fucking stupid. Anti vax fringe, lunatic movement ever met single person following Covid. widespread opposition vaccine span year open talk violence sides force people vaccinate/resist unwanted medical procedures respectively. Vaccinated people typically spread virus per numerous studies including one CDC. feel like people know vaccine kick second get still wear mask couple weeks after. Especially since everyone fully vaccinated yet. want it, choice. much saying accurate.

Vaccines currently approved Emergency Use Authorization. mean fully test them.

We know side effects are, minimal. people fully vaccinated full year, far longer vaccine side effect ever taken show itself. closely monitored, nothing bad found them.

Allergic reactions extremely rare, 2 5 occurrences per million injections. they're easily treated epinephrine. vaccines contain absolutely bees, wasps, latex, silicone, penicillin, related chemicals trigger known allergies.  God can't imagine mindset living past year, offered literal miracle cure, free charge, saying ""...nah.""  get covid yet. Got tested multiple times case throughout year. always negative. I'm Ontario, Canada I'm try warn guys. variants coming joke. I'm getting shitload downvotes. third lockdown although behind vaccines, helping much variants. I've trying explain you, young healthy people turning ICU. kinds people even mighty USA, vaccinated weeks even months.  time relent. even vaccinated Covid, one knows yet still spread virus even get reinfected variants, regardless prior immunity not. 

A lot people seem Covid victory lap already laughing face new variants, unfortunately way early that. seem really really really really really really really worried! think calling people ""supreme dumbass"", ""stupid"", ""head asses"" way win hearts minds? Yeah, meant expecting everyone first dose May 1st, major NE cities won‚Äôt even vaccines available everyone then, probably right expectation Thank you! CDC update first dose shots:

2,239,451 first dose shots. Last week 2,215,603

7 day rolling avg 1,749,362. 1,745,956 yesterday. 

101.2m adults first doses - 39.2% (up 38.4%)

74.4% 65+ done (up 73.7%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

April - 150.2m 58.2%

May - 204.5m - 79.3%

40% 4/4

50% 4/18

60% 5/3

**Total population numbers**

40% 4/20

50% 5/09

60% 5/28

69.420% 6/15

Nice see 65+ get nice boost. might keep going 80%+ Got first shot yesterday news? Good things come pairs Fauci. Considering initial ACA statewide stand ups, probably, doesn‚Äôt mean wouldn‚Äôt useful. worth, flu shot 40% efficacy rate. First dose Pfizer ~80%.

I got first dose Pfizer three-ish weeks ago. I'm completely protected, nice able go without nagging worry infection back head. I'm still cautious wearing mask, I'm hanging less responsible friends often slowly letting guard down. nice.

Where live, people getting vaccinated point choose to. point, really care get infected. feel bad medical staff - that's it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, hot gives people acne - least reasons I‚Äôve heard.  I'm also interested EU works travel within schengen block rangers fan...you‚Äôre probably right. keep saying When's last time guy changed mind? think problem sometime ""just asking questions"" still pushing particular narrative. Like back Trump president ""just asking questions"" Obama's birth certificate. Sure, maybe asking ""where birth certificate,"" done service particular narrative. case, repeated asking question come pushing narrative vaccine safe. goes commenting misleading half-truth ""unapproved"" vaccines. seems like may purposefully trying push narrative, I'd imagine that's downvoted much are. 

I feel like broken record vaccines ""in approval process."" applied. applied reasons we've discussed ad nauseum. Thank offer need update - feel unanswered questions point. It‚Äôs them, it‚Äôs everyone around may antibodies wear off. Vaccinated people slaughter R0 rate, however, pandemic ends. 


The risk vaccine resistant mutations, everyone keeps failing realize need mutate signifigantly point vaccine barely works cause another massive outbreak. 


Less people get infected, carry people. COVID would eventually burn remaining community members vaccinated, mutate enough reinfect vaccinated (which big if), would die community matter weeks. Exponential spread works ways, die quickly runs hosts. heard, anecdotally anyway, already virus symptoms vaccine tend much worse Yeah wtf about. jobs numbers excellent. backwards. Trumps around, better chance 4th wave. UK part Europe. USA part different continent. Nah. like like this. need anything getting bworse. Government tends make things worse, bet I'd always bet government getting wrong first five times. design. Yes Illinois increasing past two weeks, metrics still currently better last Summer's average (though might case week now).

The growth slowing plateauing, I'm hoping 2 weeks decline due vaccinations, although could another bump Easter weekend. what's going seemed well ... Well ... What? already prioritizing vaccines elderly without issues  Kind like Texas governor ended state mask mandate.

Governor: need mask mandate anymore people learned responsible protecting other

People: Fuck yeah!! masks!!!

Stores: Please keep wearing masks stores.

People: Fuck that! said, masks!!!

It's like Texas governor met Texans before. :/ got bootleg Walgreens one need get swapped CDC one lol got seasons mixed up, referring dip fall summer surge. No. fundamentally same. right walking biohazard. Take vaccine stay isolated forever. choice. Sadly far think. Doubtful.
The majority US get vaccinated. will. life returns normal, odd don‚Äôt might get sick. might not, we‚Äôve achieved herd immunity. we‚Äôve achieved herd immunity, regardless ‚Äúcovid passport‚Äù stuff, cases drop. Requiring ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù won‚Äôt change fact people going get vaccinated droves Yes perfectly safe Wait.....we 3rd? felt like second one kept grip throat longer.... already covid, without knowing? Maybe already built immunity. Vaccinated people able whatever want settings vaccinated people present, much clear. New York developed Excelsior Pass grant vaccinated people access businesses venues still wear mask inside, joke.

If precautions still place clear exit criteria 4th July get ugly. Lmao stop stupid purpose. GOP style arguing embarrassing. know difference fat epidemic COVID. That's accurate. posted already. didn‚Äôt know - thank you! We‚Äôll see. Certain states taking forever roll vax plan also high demand. saw dip summer last year many people getting sick spring 2020

What alternative reality land live in? Infections summer 2020 spiked significantly higher spring.

You got facts turned Thanks all! Reassurance always nice.  saying agree justification, NH saying:

* number vaccine doses allotted NH federal government based number NH residents
* Out-of-state college kids NH residents ""count"" terms number doses allotted federal government
* Out-of-state college kids ""count"" home states terms number doses allotted federal government
* Therefore, out-of-state college kids get vaccine doses home states, that's federal government allotted doses

I mean, seems much ado nothing ticky tack politics, see they're it, avoid pissing NH voters there's shortage start complaining needles going arms out-of-staters out-of-staters increasing home state's allotment vaccine NH's allotment. daily discussion overloaded people complaining people overly cautious/critical/pessimistic? 

Maybe forms social media, rarely see pessimistic attitude posted, daily discussions, see post post complaining people. take NSAIDS, take 1-2 days before, 2 hours after, receiving vaccine. still got upvote, tho. 

And definitely take ""every"" NSAID, ever, esp stomach issues, crying loud. That's great üëç  already hitting places. Whether gets bad others, suspect won't. But, already happening. normal flu season results 105 deaths per day average amortized across entire year. 75% flu deaths occur 4 months year, that's 250 deaths per day months.

I would love get zero take consideration talking open society. too! Next Friday. booked appointment early morning yesterday, excited go back sleep. want hug mom again, go visit dad Florida. clinical trial involving around 40,000 people, actually *likely* side-effects occurring in, say 1 40,000 people, appear. Even one case appear, even linking case causally vaccine difficult. also need compare incidence placebo group.

In case, clotting disorder clearly unique thing (i.e. nothing like clots affect women birth control), women may risk. 5 cases around 120,000 vaccinated (mostly female health care workers) suggests common, *could* detected AZ phase III-trial conducted women 20-60 y.o. Homeless people using restroom floor first round lockdowns restrooms parks shops closed. lot ashamed embarrassed didn‚Äôt choice. already hitting michigan tho lol frustrating one knows vaccines approved, even people signed papers acknowledging approved. share frustration.

Well, thanks helping us speed approval process. several friends getting vaccine support it.

I've asked thread two occasions, like two weeks ago yesterday. seems people hate question want help find answer (pretty toxic group). think stage people can't help keep asking doctors see FDA help. know documents showing vaccines approval process what's left done.

Would interested answer ever get it? could reply thread details. assume not, figured ask. else doing? They're vaccinated. They're clear. author points several specific things Berenson glaringly wrong on: ‚Äúsuspected unconfirmed‚Äù issue, white blood cells, cases rising vaccination. It‚Äôs quite clear Berenson master misinterpreting information order fit narrative. cases listed above, actual explanation issues, per experts specific knowledge them, exact opposite Berenson suggesting.

I mean, seriously telling think Berenson knows immunology vaccinology Shane Crotty? One renowned immunologist decades experience Twitter hack freelance journalist absolutely training field. live curiosity? change mask every day like change underwear every day. still skin issues, change mask twice day. keeps moisture stops harmful microbes getting foothold. Masks pretty cheap nowdays. agree, adults won't. Thus, necessary us vaccinate kids. Schools actually require it. going force small business require it? Hopefully won‚Äôt many unvaccinated people would cause huge surge would warrant restrictions.

No offense people refuse vaccine don‚Äôt really care happens catch concert. That‚Äôs you. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

I thought considered impossible ever get zero cases, flu. That's Prof Chris Whitty said UK govt briefing day anyhow.  country population 163 million people population density 1.26 thousand people per square kilometre handled well. bad news.

21000 good news

A couple dozen. Definitely prevalent really scare you? like 24 18 million... I'd still take either vaccine. nothing vaccines. fact [hospitalization rates people 70 going People 50 younger ones filling hospitals now, population barely vaccinated. Yes, government people confident situation backfired dramatically. lesson learn. US also seeing rising cases states. 

BTW: case nurse vaccinated Pfizer seriously ill too. messaging? disaster conducting scientific experiment lmao. disaster way handled full flight covid infected people.

Why? erred side protection, time testing, increased efficiency vaccine. like reducing dose size found giving people dangerous amount.

Seems like logical process me. I'm trying help friends put risk/benefit vaccines vs COVID context wondering anyone info age related severe COVID risks? 

The best one find table CDC April last  chest pain ekg abnormalities ER. wasn‚Äôt heart attack told follow cardiologist. cardiologists area seeing patients virtually. cardiology appointment one listened heart examined me. chatted 10 mins, ordered CT blood vessels normal, never followed chest pain.

Its strategy, insult. mandatory testing does, testing sports testing positive trended younger, correct? Pfizer didn‚Äôt fare better. Russian uses old tech know last 80-100 years, data

Pfizer uses 20 year old tech rushed phase 3 trials emergency approval( regular).

It‚Äôs like Pfizer fared better long term Russian. You, pointing bowl full green purple Skittles: Look, Green Skittles!

""Yeah 10% NO. GREEN. FUCKING. SKITTLES.

""Yeah 10% OBVIOUS HIDING INFORMATION.

""Ok. Neato."" AZ US trial unblinded yesterday told received vaccine placebo. thought would get news based reaction.

Only problem New York, live, Cuomo launched app vaccine proof shown get things like pro sports games - think use far. can‚Äôt get app vaccine approved. told AZ expect approval next weeks. I‚Äôm optimistic given problems linked vaccine.

They told they‚Äôd recommend getting another vaccine hasn‚Äôt studied, may look getting J&amp;J like month AZ hasn‚Äôt approved there‚Äôs negative impacts life unvaccinated state‚Äôs eyes. 

I told get vaccine card proof, sure either since unapproved vaccine. I‚Äôm sure okay international travel since many countries administering AZ, still unsure viewed locally. least around lot appointment times available throughout day evening. matter really weird, generally boonies shots available. mid major cities.  
That said, announcements times go mystery many people government based scheduling websites generally suuuuuuuuck. Add fact lot state ran clinics 8-3 9-5 get it. First line 65+ risk dying. they're getting mocked it? SNL punching down, cruel nasty. That's DeWine took virus seriously beginning. idiot GOP, happens current lot are. Thank you! experienced things well. first year college desk room. What‚Äôs point? talking age group whether followed restrictions, missed on. Mine too, you‚Äôre forging card someone, you‚Äôre probably gonna hesitate ask extra info steal identity. exactly question here? Antibodies waning time leads reinfection. That's shown Danish study protection. sustained antibodies less likely reinfected. high levels antibodies initially sustained severe disease (this would rapid onset scenario describe elsewhere...look comments). studies break Th1 vs Th2 responses. Hiding information casting doubt order manipulate people‚Äôs actions definitely propaganda. I'm Brazilian good news. suck fighting covid here, hospitals currently fucked, we're worst part pandemic, variant attacks younger people lot too, good news still celebrate! 

 

I'm 28yo, working home, risk factors take time allowed take vaccine shots worries bit, long people getting vaccinated helps to, least, make hospitals full, great!  Hopefully sooner rather later, first Moderna doses expected arrive soon Novavax approved month probably see significant boost either May earliest. Ah yes giant diesel powered cities water Most. many countries Europe would say sane? All? Waiter, there's fly primordial soup. ""UK bad EU good"" comments sub well. Point figures like aides bad talking 90 percent people passing virus.

We're talking 10 percent people able pass on.

Which god damn Maybe wasn‚Äôt intention, definitely come saying ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs let people know truth vaccine do, may engage behavior don‚Äôt like.‚Äù

I literally can't wait extrovert again. I'm saying headline That‚Äôs propaganda. 

Your understanding term ""propaganda"" means roughly strong meaty grasp statistics. ... can't roll zero d20 ü§î dont know seen page before. Thanks! nothing else, shut college, lost restaurant jobs, couldn‚Äôt play organized sports, couldn‚Äôt attend concerts. That‚Äôs sacrifice. Mississippi really easy access vaccine high infection rates 2020 pretty much everyone I‚Äôve known either least partially vaccinated, fully vaccinated Covid. I‚Äôm surprised testing dropping. concern we‚Äôre going face variants previous infection allows little protection one break vaccine protection booster produced. Srbija Tokija looking? got dose Cleveland pick timeslot last weekend using [the gettheshot US bought first x million doses vaccine producers US. Trump signed EO doses, owned US, given away Americans access vaccines. Lol what? famous joke goes US citizens married Kim Kardashian died Ebola. Ebola significant effect hardly American lives. There's really big difference though... efficacy vaccines Chile average much lower US. point much US vaccinating we're using damn good vaccines better anywhere else world Israel look average like people math. even try. major error. vaccinating 2.9M new people per day. Half shots go new people half 2nd-shots, going people already counted.

So 3M shots given, 1.5M new people join vaccinated set, 1.5M, already counted, complete program. results twice long figured.

BTW, point J&amp;J would merit become mute. lost American inventory due factory error. they've tiny blip numbers, change time soon. never major factor US started late...and poorly. Yeah, vaccine free, can't good. /s Reaction 15 minutes shot, blood pressure heart rate elevated dangerous levels. allowed leave three hours observation driving home. get bed four days due sore inflamed joints aches. Ironically able report symptoms CDC site. total 8 days, headache persisted three days.

I probably mention I'm healthy I'm excellent shape. autoimmune disorder cause much trouble 90% time. fuck knowing Fauci. pretty dumb huh? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è No. horrible means carers can't life outside work. Ahh heard know case. Thank you. Obesity rate Netherlands: 15%
Obesity rate US: 42%

You guys waaaaaaay better us. vaccinated go fully normal. removing mask mandates yet want cause people vaccine start stuff like they're vaccinated. Cinco de Mayo expect things basically normal certainly 100% normal July 4th don‚Äôt see how. 

Israel saw r drop 1 reached 50 percent population receiving first dose. 

We several things going favor, compared Israel. First, much natural immunity. Second, it‚Äôs likely fewer cases variants. Israel 90% UK variant. Current predictions seem place us somewhere 50-60 percent UK variant. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know much Chile‚Äôs situation. I‚Äôll look it. wonder think Xi microchipping forced shots Tourette‚Äôs ADHD uncommon comorbidities- especially already Tourette‚Äôs diagnosis. point want ask medical professional, random Redditor like me, test ADHD cognition difficulties describe don‚Äôt sound like ‚Äúpure‚Äù Tourette‚Äôs. ADHD medications really help. seemed better system though Britain confirmed 30 blood clot cases, dead. Anyway, arguing AstraZeneca general good herd immunity. disagree fair compare number deaths per infected cases. know, order die COVID, need first exposed, infected, get serious disease, etc. healthy adult goes voluntarily takes vaccine, exposed risk. might never caught Covid all. That‚Äôs Norwegian government put AZ hold. Bolsanaro responsible [Brazil P1 increase deaths younger Brazilians. things equal it‚Äôs 2-3x higher strains. 

Downvote ya want üëåüèª Thanks! Looks like CDC found 80% 2 weeks first dose 90% 2 weeks dose 2. Let‚Äôs get doses fine! would hate you. Scared suspicious everything. 

Are bad people world? course are. think you‚Äôre way overestimating many. live life part means basic trust experts spent decades rising top fields aren‚Äôt get you. Considering there‚Äôs six months‚Äô worth trial data right now, we‚Äôll know data comes in. ‚Äúdecay‚Äù rate vaccine seems pretty low ‚Äî it‚Äôs still highly effective (91%) 6 months. So, it‚Äôs possible boosters might required every year, maybe every two years, or, best-case, never. say, it‚Äôs early know sure yet. ;) Yeah did. He‚Äôs relevant line work long I‚Äôve field. sorry understood phase 3 done emergency approval.

If remember phase 3 trials 1 4 years trials see long term effects.

I didn‚Äôt take Sputnik data variants Pfizer gave info worked British variant. took calculated risk keeping mind it‚Äôs technology 20 years old tested past, Pfizers trials cherry top. 

I don‚Äôt really take weight studies done pharmaceuticals third party.


Before accuse spreading propaganda;

By ive seen

Pfizer reigns supreme all
Sputnik comes second
AstraZenecca works well
Chinese barely side effects, inactivated virus, gives least amount antibodies compared vaccines ( efficacy around 75%) tier wise....

Pfizer Goku/X-Box Series X

Moderna Vegeta/PlayStation 5

Johnson &amp; Johnson Trunks/Switch

AstraZeneca ???? Uhuuul go Brazil üí™üí™üí™üí™üí™ OH adults already eligible. aren‚Äôt prioritizing college students, using single dose J&amp;J us. Anyone 16+ go online schedule dose already, that‚Äôs last weekend. plenty timeslots available, it‚Äôs like college students stealing doses people. They‚Äôre also trying protect families towns we‚Äôre going home end semester. CDC actually said vaccinated people spread virus White House made walk back. CDC ready move on, White House that's intervening pumping brakes. think better get vulnerable people first 1)they necessarily gathering they're less likely avg, 2)they susceptible death, 3)you can't wait complete isolation, better get vulnerable people vaccinated first get deaths hospitalizations down. older people ""spreader"" group would vaccinated anyway knowledge, vaccinating people likely spread necessary, necessarily go first Vaccinate self? Yes.

Vaccinating Palestinians? much. drove almost hour get shot Wolstein Center. Worth it. shot arm within 10 minutes arriving. ... honest checks. honor system. friend signed up, claimed bullshit qualification walked without problem.

Which seemed reasonable like vitally important zero healthy 20 years old get vaccine lol.

I got mine week early mom sent tweet DeWine going announce places extra appts, anyone free sign up. grabbed appt *before* announcement haha. Even still really issue getting appts general right now, esp many retail options. Link small sample, pretty solid methodology, 1 dose mRNA vaccine 80% effective preventing infection. symptoms infection. different though? genuinely don‚Äôt understand point discussion increase occurrence invoke militaristic frame simply commenting change value. mentioned personal detail shouldn‚Äôt got fucked it, rightly so. 

Stocks shouldn‚Äôt even list things argument freely distributing vaccines. keeping it, US already bought millions doses sitting warehouses. know need it, we'll actively arrange send countries good. million doses sent Mexico Canada start. don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs relevant. contributions public health Mostly making carers live worked. way hell. There's enough space homes I've worked in. think Fauci acts way publicity Supply outstrip demand US within next 6 weeks. seeing many states open registration 65 50 16, rather 10-15 year increments. Chile similar vaccination rate, actually little higher, US middle largest wave seen. Though cases Chile remain highest death toll remains relatively low months. definitely think US could see relatively large rise cases next month so. Though might add near much winter surge even happened due vaccination risk individuals deaths lower remain steady. crazy people saying never deliver good news want pandemic continue stay relevant? Okay, spreading virus bad, yes? Vaccine appointments done ""Northern Cyprus"" realize athletes celebrities get presidential medal freedom too, right? think depends live willing people vaccinated. would think it‚Äôs completely obvious point different states different values. differences even within state (like Florida‚Äôs patchwork local control measures). 

For example, Florida posted new high positive tests hasn‚Äôt seen month. One wife‚Äôs coworkers quarantine right got covid. 

Maybe it‚Äôs better say Florida probably won‚Äôt see death count saw last year. people Florida really need keep following guidance time. It‚Äôs lot places. /s ? virus dying many places. 

And places like state, Michigan, longer lockdowns fewer cases, meaning less immunity. It‚Äôs surprise we‚Äôre surging harder hit places like LA declining. critical vaccinate 1st world soon possible. 3rd world countries don‚Äôt need vaccinate people administer too. 

Once 1st world vaccinate able send doctors nurses places vaccinate them. UN position send medical personal sending vaccine waste resources would better used vaccinate plan send staff administer vaccine rest world. 

It‚Äôs always money issue cases it‚Äôs need people planning. Charity groups already set reach people need doctors nurses administer vaccine. China Vietnam Couple questions.

Does viral load affect incubation period? example, person gets larger viral load, show symptoms sooner?

Do shorter/longer incubation periods anything severe outcomes? example, someone shows symptoms within 2 3 days get sicker someone shows symptoms 7 8 days?

Thanks. mean, people seem able remember covid19, covid19 a1? People memorize Influenza H1N1 H5N5 easily well.

And agree Chinese overreacted hurt feelings, set precedent now, stick it. anti-maskers population Covid-case tracking (like college students are) demonstrably behind majority cases area, would support too!  vaccine Brazil giving citizens? Idk, friends college students OH rn we‚Äôve either gotten first dose scheduled. We‚Äôre pretty desperate over, since fucked graduations one full year college already. didn‚Äôt even lower tuition. guess, i'd think ethically can't take insulin syringes since people need those. think happened toilet paper people started stocking - manufacturers immediately give us toilet paper, leading shortages, position increase production wait demand go down. 

if they're increasing production, there's reason make insulin needles make specialty needle that's optimized instead.

again speculation though; maybe someone informed answer. hell China handle Covid better? targetted doctors bringing light tried hide couldn't, put everyone house arrest. Oh, also lied numbers cases deaths. Good fucking job China. couldn‚Äôt care less 20k vaccine stocks even tried. saving millions lives means destroying livelihood, lol I‚Äôd still heartbeat. People wealth people prioritize personal profits helping people. 

Get screwed.  said aren‚Äôt many states get paid affordable real estate. understand I‚Äôm saying? know real estate expensive. Dummy. health officials saying people fucking bonkers. **at least** six months they‚Äôre Boston. Stereotyping perfectly appropriate question group whole. agree, sounds plausible. Obesity probably LOT rarer US. Could continue escalating. We've got one case France, 38yo lady died blood clots *2 weeks* AZ shot. doctors trace happened patients *weeks* shot.

With many diabetics America, can‚Äôt possibly hard get good supply insulin syringes. could care less folks refuse vaccine. Fauci‚Äôs presence without mask increase risk room meaningful amount.

The long short simply this: CDC wants us wear masks rest lives fools. objective criteria milestones waiting publish science behind use.

We cannot pause state fear uncertainty.

Today started coughing feeling unwell. told boss contact someone positive fell unwell really say anything shrugged off. 
My boss owns 2 mechanic shops mechanic him. buddy‚Äôs blog appears makes happy. :) sounds like they've created perverse incentive structure people come work covid. Given people contagious show strong symptoms, policy probably caused quite lot harm. first post sub I've seen inciting irrational fear. Yay South Carolina too. wonder something like alot woman (under 60) received vaccin (because ratio male/female workers healthcare). texas last month. left day mandate ended. Sunday sitting bar going outside something bartender told dont need put mask on. look like ""you dont need condom"" means definitely wear condom. Monday, Chicago entered Phase 1C, opened eligibility anyone 16 older qualifying medical conditions, plus types essential workers -- food beverage employees, media members clergy among them.

&amp;#x200B;

they're ""lagging"" behind.. that's expected single largest metro state. 1A B people.

&amp;#x200B;

3 counties 50% states population.

5 12M cook essential/food people still waiting, can't disagree. UCSF also one these. interesting perspective seems reasonable really considered. 

Thanks sharing thought process. opinion, think they're reacting Ontario.

Cases deaths seems low reaction think science settled 18 month old vaccine skipped trials FDA approved? 

If want file complaint author solicitous wording maybe avoid using invoking language yourself. 

The researchers article clearly articulate vaccine indeed prevent infection all, instead somewhere around 80 percent got first dose (90% both). way article title misleading? 

The answer ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù totally expect science based single study 4000 people. Especially considering several vaccines made different companies need accounted for. Let alone rates infection vaccinated come across variants weren‚Äôt part study. Meh. I‚Äôve gotta get kid vaccinated send school, parents provide records went hockey camp kid, previous employer required reason didn‚Äôt care enough ask about. Public health measures require public compliance. don‚Äôt wish avail public and, importantly directly point, private services, that‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt get shots participate vaccine passport programs. Loonies made bed private businesses able deny service flexing hard man-on-man wedding cake issue, they‚Äôre reaping they‚Äôve sown. build airplanes, concert venues, sports facilities don‚Äôt like it, like told gay people find service elsewhere. That‚Äôs correct BioNTech develop vaccine, it‚Äôs one little guys. It‚Äôs publicly traded company currently market cap exceeding 27 billion dollars. Moderna isn‚Äôt exactly small either, market cap 50 billion dollars...

Sure they‚Äôre smaller J&amp;J, point size really matters logistic standpoint. issues rollout you‚Äôre small, similar issues you‚Äôre large mishandle companies contract actually produce vaccine sub compounds. quite right. evidence transmit vaccinated, conclusive yet. said health ministry remained concerned lethal vaccine-resistant Covid variants. reason, Israel kept tight restrictions incoming international travellers, limiting number allowed in. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre really good place it‚Äôs important protect achievement,‚Äù said Alroy-Preis.

This scary me. every adult country either vaccinated could easily get whenever choose to, restrictions end. always new variants (there's thousands known variants already - appear recently media started focusing them), justifying continued restrictions based means there's actual ""endgame""... I‚Äôm sure schools would like get cost annoyance Covid protocols ASAP. already B1.1.1.7 there. spokesman, labs grinding science. matter thinks? ‚Äúineffective‚Äù? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. impression vaccines worked take first one available regardless brand don‚Äôt think spreads much faster B.1.1.7 already widespread NA. Oh sorry, misread. thought said 95% efficacy 7 days first dose, second dose. met American before? isn‚Äôt going end well Yes! Let‚Äôs go! cases primarily driven 18-39 year olds, would make sense put shots them? man Surely positivity rate actually matters.

I heard number tests Los Angeles' dropped 70%, month ago. No..... depending shot like 70-80% aren‚Äôt ducking immune can‚Äôt go running around without mask It‚Äôs dumb many people got two shots it‚Äôs even open others getting firdt I'm saying 14 day thing ""safe"" thing. like set weight limit bridge, usually handle much limit. catch, get cold faster 14 days. I'm sure immune systems handle vaccine less time. CDC director said ‚ÄúImpending doom!!‚Äù think like regard. even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôll around others fully vaccinated avoid public indoor spaces now. aren‚Äôt comfortable indoors around strangers yet, weather Iowa pretty nice now, I‚Äôd bet outdoor dates/long walks would work meeting people. Otherwise indoor meetings vaccinated folks quite safe. tl;dr - make sure get shots fine. Got source 50% trend? Yo you‚Äôre forgetting microchips tracking baby fetuses! guns! DARE you? COVID vaccine added yellow book international travel. really think I'll tell people like you? article Israel's response covid, nothing else. Lol I'm now? I'm saying question make sense let pay you? work small business, see they'd able pay time. virus still forces layoffs

Let's precise language. government restrictions imposed reaction virus still forces layoffs. That's know sure. 10% vaccinated people still become infected asymptomatic. know whether lower viral load threshold transmission. might be, might not. Yeah people seem think spreading fast elsewhere it'll spread fast would still somehow supplant B117 variant order take hold. Bruh whole pandemic? swear time April 2020 cracked open alcohol like 1pm workday Yeah too. We‚Äôre going bbq couple weeks adults vaccinated kids 5. Staying outdoors feel safe them. country becoming dumpster fire don‚Äôt trying pretend someone else sure seems moron said 2,988,825M/day currently. hit tomorrow.  Agreed! (: arm hurts jab yesterday I‚Äôm happy masking virus measures, vaccines politically polarized far. think vaccine passport conversation dangerous one, entangles vaccination politics. think certain political factions going strongly opposed idea, might soften vaccine demand certain areas move implement policy.

Isn't point vaccine passport protect cannot vaccinated? cares choose vaccinated? Measles kills disables infants, would argue unreasonable want vaccine passports Measles settings. leave? Lol Tell everyone California still can't go school ""were pandemic"". Thank you. 

I edited first comment nobody got bad information brain fart moment. thought said take medicine waited full day took it. get avg distribution, per capita. Unless it‚Äôs strategic like portion school prison. Makes sense. It‚Äôs tough make decisions right now, hope gets easier least clear. 1/3rd population (like 35-40%) pretty consensus among epidemiologists. What? 100% normal 4 July? I‚Äôm jerk here, I‚Äôm getting completely confused. 

I see variant cases rise, yet hear want hopeful. people getting from? I‚Äôve gotten tested 11 times, either 1) school required it, 2) possible contact, 3) visit high risk people. 

Agreed testing fun every week doesn‚Äôt make sense. totally fair, point Cuomo opening aspects NYC seeing increase predictable.

Cuomo get called lot mainstream press, reason. /s We're June 5th. Honestly terrified everyone show first event they've gone year. feed people! created absolute strawman. starting fourth wave right now? Cases rising Michigan still mask mandate place. missing here? general there‚Äôs enough vaccines get everyone world vaccinated. 

Some countries, especially rich ones, bought currently available stock cut better deals suppliers. 

The AstraZeneca vaccine showing concerning side effects, especially women age 25 80, also happen make majority healthcare workforce. 

The suspicious cases blood clots instance investigated continue vaccinating people. It‚Äôs easy decision make, relatively vaccinations available yet age group first place. 

To put perspective, 5 cases currently known 400.000 vaccinations one death. odds dying way vaccination center higher dying actual vaccination itself.

That doesn‚Äôt change fact AstraZeneca shows side effects counterparts though. can't get bar without ID. worries. Sorry hear week. Best luck future. debate here. told government bootlickers, full stop. 

Deciding level risk Nazis something apparently. Covid: Excellent...welcome back. Soooo, break me. When‚Äôs shit over? 4th? Bruh never left 1st think concerned students bothering home state, coming back fall. Also, lot upper classmen Ohio state live campus yeah round. 

Or, really want get sports teams done can‚Äôt give priority access don‚Äôt give students. Hey look guys found another one explain yourself. disregarding science virology? average Texan isn‚Äôt wealthy enough governor care them. Facebook cell phone company could also harvesting ""check-ins"" build profile--in fact, I'm relatively certain they've years. Cell phones used quite routinely court cases ascertain someone's location particular time. mean, going *forever* people care, actually pony loads cash voluntarily buy tracking devices! sold ""privacy"" long time ago. 

I see vaccine passports would make worse already is. right exact science every one develop immunity.

I'm qualified speak specifics vaccine depth there's going deviation regardless across people. deviation general rule time wait 2 weeks 2nd shot seeing that's furthest data set have.

My main point rush it. collective health species literally depends people waiting *slightly* longer. year, whats extra 14 days top really I've repeatedly pushed people take vaccine I'll still even context.
My mom grandmother received last month I'm f*cking glad thousand times worried end ICU unit Covid rather get blood clot.

That doesn‚Äôt change fact despite initially reported non EU member state (Norway) minute investigations launched this, people kept banging could mean foul play EU.
This would hilarious people didn‚Äôt adamantly believed kind bs apparently still despite fact MHRA looking similar cases.
In alternate universe, could collaborative constructive discussion prevalence effects, risk-benefits ratio, drugs vaccines could lead similar risks yet ultimately safe, etc etc.
Instead turned immediately unsurprisingly baseless mudslinging.
I've spent last 12 months debunking conspiracy theories vaccines, it‚Äôs getting nerves defending vaccines believing conspiracy theories. proof vaccination get swab nose. Yep, close 3m cigar. tomorrow similar increases last Saturday today last Friday, cross 3m easily well 40% adults. rate, even sooner. Squirrels dumb. 10%

And that's 10% *now* - cannot magically ignore 2-3 weeks need wait vaccine's effects kick in. Oh think complaining. Apologies write-up sounded way. thought pretty spot on, absolutely correct People know details think companies push stuff out. Lots people know get Master's Doctorate regulatory science. stuff complicated, extremely necessary. got manufacturing 2013 Quality Regulatory. many chemicals PPE barely protects from. Good luck there! well ye, first one never ended lmao   live Germany Test Center Vaccine Sites Open like 5 hours Day 5 Days week... makes sense all? anyone currently enrolled college can't get vaccine? assume means students state?  Seems ridiculous me.  still 2 weeks away everyone eligible, still can't keep current demand.  Going insane 2 weeks now. Help. Brains washed. Thought question Q... üòÇü§îüí≠ I‚Äôm Chile. got Sinovac dose yesterday, apparently it‚Äôs least effective vaccine cannot choose one get. 25% population fully vaccinated yet cases deaths soaring. don‚Äôt know think. mine yesterday. Arm sore, nothing else though. One down, one go. Didn‚Äôt seem help Ohio. rate, older folks done, I‚Äôm seeing shipments get cut Nope, 100% hospitalization too. 78% mild symptoms. Meanwhile Alberta: what‚Äôs lockdown? director CDC also feeling sense doom right now. messaging place. Denmark 2 cases 150.000 doses given, Norway 3 cases 130.000 given. doses primarily given health care personel (below 65'ish, 55)
I aware German numbers.
In General UK recently really started using AZ younger agegroups far understand. around 175 deaths end 2020. virus around 9 months 2020, average saw 20 deaths per month.

If we‚Äôre 3 months 2021, would expect 235 deaths virus still effecting rate. 

226 pretty damn close. Nothing data would indicate jump danger. Especially average case count Jan-Mar 2021 much higher average case count Mar-Dec 2020. detailed analysis, expect actually see *more* 235 16 deaths now. good US/European distribution scale, world 7+ billion, would take 11 years meet demand though, that's assuming population growth. Aye.

Wasn't COVID causing clotting cases younger people? Maybe something bradykinin cytokines?

I wonder there's overlap certain brand birth control, low vitamin d, something vaccine pushing edge rare number. we're looking variables, maybe looking cholesterol exercise/activity rates well? It‚Äôs that. There‚Äôs lot time money involved athletic protocols. sooner done those, better. mean ""statistically immune?"" people 75% immune 1 week first shot. That‚Äôs correct. Moderna/Pfizer people ~90% less likely unvaccinated positive PCR test (given roughly behavior). people also if‚Ä¶then, smart ones. sounds like still restrictions crowd sizes, mask mandate. Done interesting:

TH1 TH2 cell polarization increases aging modulated zinc supplementation

...Old nonagenarian individuals revealed increased TH1, TH2 cell numbers decreased TH2/TH1 ratio comparison young individuals...

...Moderate zinc supplementation vivo alters TH thoroughly amusing response read 

The article flagrantly misleading headline fails utilize information disposal (kind like comment). numerous studies UK using AstraZeneca vaccine, large studies Israel recent released CDC study clearly show vaccines preventing transmission 90+% range, large studies strong methodology. even counting numerous, smaller studies exclusively focusing healthcare workers settings arrive conclusion. 

I simply label comment anti vaccine garbage, that‚Äôs is. btw, cleared emergency use FDA mean rigorous analysis applied like normal circumstances.

Truly amusing.  source people testing positive often first shot? feel sick happening? face really flushed feel run red mark tripled size overnight. definitely group untold harm done every time open mouths lie. Especially, lies don‚Äôt pass sniff test start. people scratch heads pretend understand people don‚Äôt trust government. US, vast majority working people jobs pressure take days off, ever, even work weekend/after hours. thing specifically problem parroted lie vaccines don‚Äôt impact transmission. believed that, think wouldn‚Äôt OK vaccinated person around crowded bar. Real world experience seems indicate Sputnik fine vaccine, Chinese vaccines seem failing Chile, UAE Seychelles. 

The problem Russia far closed western institutions, far corrupt. add ""coincidences"" like top, understand western people get suspicious. trust Russian approval process aforementioned reasons. Given Chinese vaccine seem faltered (with similar lack openness trust processes) understand comes from.

That said, real world data indicates Sputnik vaccine effective safe despite early doubts. Happy vaccine day! Try get therapy over, let build legitimate fear might carry long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

If not, force comfort zone get used masks, go away quickly. want wear masks need to, cause bacterial pneumonia among things due moisture build up, generally worth wearing unless illness contain. sound anxious me. haven‚Äôt anywhere 7-eleven, rite aid, maybe 6 times grocery store year. time wearing N-95. 

I get 2nd shot days. I‚Äôm gonna live life like past year 2 weeks that. 

Then I‚Äôll wear cloth mask walking around town (I live dense urban area). 

I won‚Äôt wear mask I‚Äôm wide open park space around me. 

I won‚Äôt bother wearing N-95 7-eleven, apartment building, etc. I‚Äôll still wear cloth one. 

I N-95‚Äôs left, I‚Äôll keep using busy enclosed spaces like grocery store 2 PM Sunday. I‚Äôm (maybe 10 masks left), vaccination rate high I‚Äôll feel comfortable cloth mask. 

After that, scientists say area vaccinated enough safe maskless, won‚Äôt wear mask. going prevent low-income communities accessing vaccine wealthy Chicagoans head DuPage Lake county get shots. Restrictions international travelers likely dwindle countries reach Israel's level vaccinations. feel J&amp;J vaccine? It‚Äôs reportedly 66% reduction risk One thing found really interesting people Postgraduate Degrees *higher* mortality rate people college degree. least true white/black/Hispanic, true American Indian/Native Alaskans APIs. know hostile. mad wrong something? One dose certain time period shown 80% effective, also cuts transmission based recent studies. Two obviously better. Different vaccines different efficacies different variants. appears mRNA vaccines may effective least variants vaccines may effective it‚Äôs easier require everyone test coming US figure right now. AstraZeneca supposed issue B.1.1.7 (B-117) variant. nastier vaccine escape. Gottlieb best. Sunday morning interviews face nation valuable point view anyone medical community. Personally, listen follow sub. Everything else data point take üßÇ  they're ""lagging"" behind.. that's expected single largest metro state.

Why would population density hinder vaccine distribution? much data want? LOL, obvious vaccines effective stopping getting covid quite honestly cases pretty low everywhere moment. went movies yesterday, pretty empty regardless unless seeing Godzilla/Kong movie IMAX. surprised look around theater realize nobody wearing mask anymore either. keep locking vaccinating forever, got it. posted Italian subreddit, numbers use Italian data. Also want spend much time translating used DeepL changed things there, sorry mistakes.

Regarding question risks AZ vaccine vs risks catching COVID young healthy people see lot confusion even among ""pro science"" friends online. start analysis saying advised mom grandmother get AZ vaccine think still valid vaccine. said think decision several countries ([just Netherlands) block certain age ""crazy political"" thing reflected numbers.

- Using ISS data, number cases COVID people 40 reported Italy April 1, 2021 1,360,481. various papers estimates real number COVID cases, unfortunately difficult find perfect estimate according American CDC, number detected cases 22% total number real cases. even higher estimates use lower bound. Using two data estimate (obviously lot uncertainty) number real cases Italy 0-40 range estimated around 6.2 million. also reasonable think asymptomatic cases even concentrated 0-40 range.

- According ISS, 38 people 40 years age died without major pathologies. would bring risk death healthy person age 40 (excluding risk outset catching virus) around 0.00061% one person every 163,000 infected. fair, consider registered cases, risk death 1 every 36,000 cases. 

- Regarding AstraZeneca vaccine, several cases particular type thrombosis (called Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) authors paper) reported, moment, certain countries Germany Norway, seeing 1 case per 100,000 inhabitants fatality 40%. Obviously yet ""officially"" recognized link EMA says possible given number cases compared normal population. also add since number refers general population, possible know higher lower 40 (or women), many cases range. One important thing understanding treatment warning patients possible symptoms could dramatically reduce fatality.

- would bring risk death VIPIT close risk death COVID healthy under-40 group. mention likelihood catching COVID first instance 100%, especially certain people non-risk jobs, risk getting infected dying even lower numbers.

TL;DR AstraZeneca vaccine definitely recommended people 50-60 years old, 40 healthy group benefits crystal clear imo, especially mRNA vaccines increase cases. Obviously many papers data estimates pre-prints situation evolving fast.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   know earlier cases added, could number reasons. certainly top list suddenly 17 new people developed week 2 million vaccinations despite 5 16 million prior. I'm certainly going randomly speculate know.

Additionally, since initial point Germany extremely transparent UK opaque, provided information UK provides (a list every side effect reported including incidence deaths week), provide alternative Germany. Presumably it'll age, gender, date, much information associated tens thousands reported cases.

Or based entire argument UK's opaqueness singular pathology incidence around one million? several leading theories vaccines could alleviate symptoms long COVID: possible vaccine clears leftover virus fragments, interrupts damaging autoimmune response, way ""resets"" immune system.

Does means current tests always detect virus, virus go hiding reappear? 

Why vaccines provide better immunization actual infection?

For long Covid cases referred article, guess talking mainly mRNA vaccines encode spike. spike produce better immune response actual virus?  help mean need start war Middle East?

Seriously though let‚Äôs go back pre World War America like ‚Äúyo heard need help taken care of; here‚Äôs vaccines purchase us‚Äù 2.5 million 60-year-old people caught coronavirus around 50,000 would die. 40-year-olds around 2,500 would die.

For entire pandemic, fatality rate Covid-19 40-30 74 deaths per million, including pre existing conditions. mention rushed re-opening clearly distract multiple sexual predation scandals he's involved in. anyone else suspicious considering numbers NYC BC..? Kinda feeling like tune shifted fit economy time. Sure, better anyone Trump touting correct experts, also dude told us weeks buy masks already identified airborne disease Cant fourth wave first ome didnt end new variants popping tightly controlled death grip 5G powers lmfao one got me

I hoping communicate government guess havent activated chip yet say FDA Approval EUA dishonest.

I hope FDA list tests, research, reviews, processes incomplete prevent FDA approving COVID vaccines. That's I'm interested in. hope so. We‚Äôre quite behind US vaccines it‚Äôs predicted won‚Äôt 18+/general population offered vaccine august hope changes. remember seeing video recently worried going see peak like Europe right now. So, confusing messaging bad title. Idk man, wake every morning allergic pollen least day I'm like ""is covid?"" Let hazard guess.

 reasonable person, now, probably fine restrictions going forward, long see deaths cases trending downwards, hopefully zero, atleast towards reasonably low number. 

If dont care masks social distancing vaccination, really matter threshold numbers are. continue try live life normally possible, covid damned. 

The messaging white house fauci doesnt really matter stage. late pipeline. people developed thinking now. E.g. texas even mask mandate lifted, lot people continued wear them. 

Its bad government basically stopped trying convey clear message, focusing getting job done background, long vaccination efforts still strong, everyone wants gets it, hope numbers drop low enough resume life normal. person also commented said, myth vaccinated people spread virus fact myth. question January, now. Vaccinated people spread COVID. What? probably look efficiency MMR vaccine make statements. covid vaccines far way effective vaccine history.

The reason covid shut world isn‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs deadly contagious it‚Äôs cause understand what‚Äôs happening know stop it. 

smallpox ran unchecked 100s years killing entire races people. world didn‚Äôt understand kept living life. Life hard people didn‚Äôt time worry it. know virus react differently. Congrats! lying. Nobody that.... well actually reddit so.... Yeah, would say bother point. 

My city still mask mandate wear I'm about. However, wife small Western Kansas town nobody wears mask. I've started caring I'm I'm vaccinated nobody else gives shit. don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôd call states like Michigan others North East waves, many northern Central states pretty high positivity rates consider probably another ‚Äòwave‚Äô.

But hopefully (and suspect it‚Äôs case) waves one much less severe outcomes.  relative. Ontario another wave Canada example, seeing 1/3rd cases. Michigan. again, peak daily case number second wave still 4000/day. That‚Äôs lockdown Two weeks, one week. responding poster believes vaccine good 7 days. course, haven‚Äôt you? Well, CDC director saying don‚Äôt travel... insert gif Oprah saying ‚Äúwhat truth‚Äù here. pay that.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  make sense several countries reporting cases UK seeing them.

It's significantly cases cerebral vein trombosis would expect population large. I‚Äôm tired misleading sensational headlines. one first 100,000 Americans vaccinated back December. also usage vaccine passports everyday activities feel intrusion privacy government corporations. everyone vaccine passports anti-vaxxer taking flu vaccine every year, put mask stayed home symptoms whatsoever? yeah, great CDC said could happen, personally would go crazy see parents bc sibling's devotion institution continually lie ""the greater good."" know why, reminded ""Weird Al"" lyric: 

I'd rather clean bathrooms Grand Central Station, tongue/ spend one minute like pay card get microchipped become another government project. 

^^^^/s Lol...they‚Äôve trying hard spread trains too. one knife, machete, ax, gun away dealing trains too. got mine dude. happy Friday great weekend got Moderna vaccine Monday! really impressed new company could develop ground-breaking vaccine manufacture little mistakes along way! 0.3% IFR virus?  would astounded didn‚Äôt kind comms/external affairs shop Wow. idea. I‚Äôm already making plans right vaccine appointment lol. I'm anti-mitigation person like regulars get vaccinated (and following 2 weeks last dose, sure J+J though), odds get sick low get sick, seems almost 0 chance end severely sick need hospitalized. 

There still debate safe terms able spread virus test positive fully vaccinated. looks like even odds low virus able replicate much could vaccinated. 

The reason still wear mask put others ease. want assumed anti-mask jerk people know I'm vaccinated, even claim unless card prove it. enough vaccinated stores stop requiring masks reduced capacity, think many stop wearing masks public. city much top mask wearing parts US though (for good reason). I'm sure parts US, wear mask may get looks treated meanly anti-mask people common area. evidence piling AZ vaccine fact disproportionately dangerous young healthy women.

I know Germany, risk death CVT AZ shot high, prompted clinic directors major hospitals federal health agency halt under-60 year olds, hard argue decision looking numbers.  Law enforcement needs make high profile arrests people getting fake vaccine passports. scare folks this. much easier make claim confirms priors hope one fact checks you! Life short.

Lick bowl. opinion. govt wanted vaccine passport framework would existed. end May pace like 65% pop one shot. End April 50% one shot.

The vaccine passport really moot point since we‚Äôll enough vaccinated end May get life back normal. Like video game character! Bunch plague rats safest you‚Äôre ever gonna be. Hangout friends. Wow I‚Äôll looking up, thank you. position vaccine passports unnecessary vaccinated person won‚Äôt participate. plans go country. businesses go way, won‚Äôt patronize business. Amazon. 

My life controlled people afraid go world ‚Äúunvaccinated people‚Äù. vaccinated, fine. choose go unvaccinated, you. living life around you. year... lot people done. No, course not; assigned official name way usually do.

What matters *media* chose call it. I'm sure they'd called something like Wu Han flu Trump working hard make sound like anyone endorsing anti-Chinese agenda. best evidence fact problem using local names variants. one trying politicize variant names, media goes what's easy remember. Also article:

""The CDC said study results Monday provide reassurance people start develop protection vaccine two weeks first dose, although agency reiterated greatest protection seen among received recommended doses vaccines."" Yes posted something similar! I‚Äôm beginning think MIL invincible, received second dose Monday. responsible 16% COVID deaths US...

There 554,000 covid deaths US.

16% would 88,000

Florida 33,000 covid deaths.

Did mean *6%*? 

By coincidence I'm sure, Florida also 6% total US population living there. Yeah, hard see helps. CEO thinks might get EUA May. We'll close done then. I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs comparing raw computing power. Series X severe supply chain issues since launch, powerful console knowledge. I‚Äôd agree first time ‚Äújust 40-60 days‚Äù uttered. Go Oregon! Fight vaccines! got Johnson. boring 15 mins life imo. live middle Iowa, I‚Äôm definitely minority comes mask wearing. care? think you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm going start working it. It‚Äôs bit nuts expect turned two year old wear one long. He‚Äôs barely even verbal yet. Doesn‚Äôt help live wear masks worn much he‚Äôs almost exposure it. guess something keep trying him! Hi Michigan. shit show already. getting upwards 6000 cases day recently pop. around 10 million. Fauci say expect 4th wave every state. Hopefully vaccination goes quick enough regions miss one. clear, 4th wave already areas. favorite comment long time. Absolutely, especially last year‚Äôs horrors incompetence. 

Churchill said best: ‚ÄúAmericans always right thing, tried everything else‚Äù. 

And damn, US ever vaccinations right - easy feat, US logistics machine gets running, ever impressive sight behold. Yeah people getting vaccinated therefore going safely, feel like people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated first dose beginning live like covid totally gone. 

This anecdotal though stay Instagram. lived 8 years, buy crap state sells, especially Rebekah Jones raid make sound like don‚Äôt get vaccinated either stay home I‚Äôm sick. course I‚Äôm cautious global pandemic strikes wait lmao never stopped. Well, going movies harder. Nobody forced stop dating hanging friends tho. COVID-19 vaccines developed Pfizer Inc BioNTech SE Moderna Inc reduced risk infection 80% two weeks first two shots, according data real-world U.S. study released Monday Yeah, saying arbitrary restrictions freedom association commerce interfere living whole lives *exactly* petty bureaucrats say. really despise everything mentality. It‚Äôs even less hard wear one all. experiencing conditions serious enough warrant masks. damn weird. can‚Äôt even. Anti maskers anti vaxxers almost invariably projecting mental illness insecurities others. May 21st mine FL beaches. Even today would still pretty normal lol  That‚Äôs I‚Äôm thinking well. Ah yes meant say turned two years old. Air France doesn‚Äôt enforce 11 (though would still try hardest get one keep on). agree, sister's hangup, mine. I'm glad announcement lets even cautious people rest easy. COVID-19 vaccines developed Pfizer Inc BioNTech SE Moderna Inc reduced risk infection 80% two weeks first two shots, according data real-world U.S. study released Monday Unless missed something suggesting it‚Äôs likely vaccinated people don‚Äôt spread virus, think it‚Äôs case can‚Äôt 100% say certain. I‚Äôm wrong please correct me. That's CDC says vaccinated people gather low-risk unvaccinated people without masks

They didn't, [literally right problem factor human behavior policy making. point, people covid fatigue. vaccinated people let loose meet whoever want, behavior may different unvaccinated mask wearing people. already see people thread saying ""Why re-open already"". People think vaccinated guidelines apply 2 weeks got vaccine. Maybe think risk low enough, health taking risk on, everyone else's. get decide ""enough risk"". things considered 

By factor AZ better AZ ? misinformation fall libel slander? Since damage company reputation? Lol, live middle Iowa, it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm exactly thriving pre-COVID anyway. People literally drive hour go shitty bar, don‚Äôt drink. guess I‚Äôll go family decide eat again. I'd keep next pandemic...or international flight, wildfire, kitchen table sanding, whatever. literally think million uses burning top list me. I‚Äôm sorry hate freedom speech much. Ugh. People rights speak freely, matter stupid opinions are. don‚Äôt like that, move totalitarian hellhole. i'd encourage ignore covid too, rest society far risk you. mean ""anymore""? EUAs invented COVID - they've around long time. Pharmaceutical companies ""bother"" full FDA approval required outside context public health emergency. want introduce e.g. new arthritis drug market, can't via EUA ongoing arthritis public health emergency declared. 

I also think sort splitting hairs, semantically here. vaccines approved FDA use health emergency via EUA. Saying ""they FDA approved"" heavily implies, intentionally not, FDA given greenlight used, explicitly have. 

So still understand? point feels like feigning ignorance bad faith.  may true don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs common knowledge phrasing, least it‚Äôs not. platform sentiment going much damage good opinion. really need information affected blood clotting. 

For example, Germany see reported age ranges 20 63 total 31 cases. 29 cases women. really know many fall age range 20-29, 30-39, ect.

If 20-29 range, becomes important vaccinate demographic different vaccine. 20 reported deaths COVID women aged 20-29 Germany. fair enough. safe tho! first shot. Good news second shot breeze. preemptively took day work, enjoyed video games chore catch up. hope true you!  Absolutely not, screw jury United Sates. truly documented punishment review due attending jury duty (it legal responsibility attend) law firm country would lining defend case.

YOU get huge trouble try skip jury duty. way thinking government side employer punishing civic duty. 

In fact HR department would aware liability situation would probably try settle outside court. Plus situation would state labor department defending employee. employer going resource state. Dude constantly posting positive stuff every jab negative one ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù smdh- female mammals lactate. Human females called women English.

No wonder people skeptical vaccines. media can‚Äôt even acknowledge basic scientific facts favor woke nonsense. Ugh no. absolutely knows do. expert. years schooling right spends time learning situation applying education make informed predictions. Newsflash, everyone needs opportunity vaccinated. Everyone pedantic around irritating. course everyone going get vaccine, everyone chance get one readily available get one. everyone get fair chance? .. get shot weird fuckers it‚Äôs important many people vaccinated possible. one person may 100% immunity, 100% people 80% average chance immunity (which studies actually measure, thing ‚Äú80% immune virus‚Äù), spread falls cliff. 1/100 die every year reference. 2020 1.2/100. Going Kauai week! Right lift 10 day quarantine rule. Dude, argument someone day kept insisting fully vaccinated husband driving hour away another city walk around weekend made horrible human being. People bit tense still. message would better come say want everyone follow restrictions 1 month everyone access vaccine. could state it‚Äôs fair healthy 20 year olds waiting turn risk people vaccinated. Whoever PR CDC needs fired hire 4 year old would get better results.

Lifting restrictions vaccinated people like slapping healthy 20 year olds face. kind respectful punish them. W didn‚Äôt need labs may true also stress, needle small feels flu shot, basically pain. vast majority people minor symptoms, arm soreness fatigue couple days. ease mind fully vaccinated make worth it! certainly nervous dropping guard month early.

I'm nervous people continue say one month later Talk Santa Clara County public health director Sara Cody, she‚Äôs still got plenty doom gloom ya. I'm interested continuing pointless debate. nutjob all! worked physician start hotspot area, obviously big effect her. could see came tears claimed heading towards ""impending doom."" That's bad messaging, comes place blinders sure. mind now, ""anything prevent happening again."" 

However, think emotions ill fit situation. need dogged practicality going forward, we're battling massive public health crises tons fronts.

1) COVID

2) dramatic rise weight gain sedentary behavior 

3) Massive wealth inequality brought conditions necessary control pandemic

4) enormous mental health crisis among young people

5) Lost education food stability low income children

It goes on. COVID become smaller concern, right thing address things affected health country. need get everyone vaccinated even think what's ""acceptable"" collateral damage. We're yet. US need vaccines covid decades 

If case, use three already approved? Pfizer Moderna vaccines appear far superior AstraZeneca's anyways, Pfizer Moderna's manufacturing partners (including Lonza Catalent) crank vaccines millions. There's reason United States approve AstraZeneca vaccine. Fauci already admitted truthful manipulate behavior significantly hurt credibility people. lose trust someone, basically impossible get back.

If honest people refuse listen, that's them. lie try manipulate people people refuse listen afterwards, that's you. Damn, India started vaccinating month ago exporting doses countries? Indian vaccination drive seems mark. 

In quite states here, they're opening vaccinations everybody 16 within next two weeks vaccinations going well. Totally free too!

I'm partly facetious read one reddit comment New Hampshire (5th smallest state US) apply rest America ""LOL AMERICA BAD"". kicking ass vaccine overall. Canada can‚Äôt even get website running order sign find get vaccinated. Covid absolutely animal reservoirs. isn‚Äôt even close happening. Cuz dunno people vaccinated still carriers Blood clots stupid reason, focusing 60+ age group good thing. mixed feelings. hadn‚Äôt appointment moderna would loved get J&amp;J offered it‚Äôs 1 shot argument would make sense big pharmaceutical companies making vaccines, companies making mRNA vaccines, like Moderna, relatively small. good news spread types vaccines, companies making certainly resources so. think negative tests happen prevent additional cases (although certainly could happen), rather encourage people get vaccinated.

There already plenty people ""why risk getting vaccinated I'm likely get COVID point"" virus stays endemic. Putting minor restrictions front cause many fence-sitters suck get jabbed. going get vaccine already? read emergency use authorization. graph cumulative incedence rate covid function days first dose. point time placebo vaccine group diverge day 12 assume Conservative Club problems this. saw doctor week. got fully vaccinated December. talked trip casinos Vegas last month. Like everyone else, sure, far older people vaccinated younger people.

Older people stupid average meters less young people present time. Interesting, relieving know isn‚Äôt me!Hopefully get figured people really need don‚Äôt waste doses slowly growing point must decide whether takes comes crashing mauled wave vaccines. Please tell us works? called politics. CDC removed that, unfortunately society can't expected think sensibly need told do, tend hear want to. Kind scary competence high mark days. would it? vaccines also trials younger people. blatantly lying public way go it? 
If anything, hearing vaccinated people freedoms motivate unvaccinated people get vaccinated. perceived benefit getting vaccine. 
The people going think ‚Äúthe pandemic over, stop careful now‚Äù probably weren‚Äôt careful begin with, doesn‚Äôt matter says what. Excellent point. think we‚Äôll still deaths people who, despite scientific anecdotal evidence there, refuse get shot even 60 years old weigh 500 pounds. Hopefully vaccines remain effective get even better COVID far less deadly season flu. Correct viewers CNN reporter tell it. tonight they're going special report Coronavirus pandemic firsthand doctors fighting it. What's going happen ten years? mRNA degrades within days human body. 

Yes, point, done job. makes proteins specific virus, simulate immune system respond, quietly goes away. weeks later, immune system concludes, ""whatever protein is, we'd really better armed it!"" 

Then real virus shows up, response immediate effective. immune system remembers, long mRNA gone. They'd either lift nationwide emergency order (which could potentially risk EUA vaccines) issue order specifically lifting mandate, current mandate expiration emergency expires. sure? first asked this, told wait everyone vaccinated. It‚Äôs okay met people didn‚Äôt get vaccinated yet? might idiotic comment I've seen written 2 years site.

That's impressive. freedom important someone else's life? Oh know that. brought HR got talked like child. Nothing since state lifting mandate next week. said they're leaving local governments businesses decide what's best. i‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many professors can‚Äôt wait go back person well. 6 weeks, guess (or 2 weeks vaccine open everyone 16+). can't see suggesting groups still able get vaccinated - create have, situation would likely result unvaccinated taking unnecessary risks (think ""my friends indoor party vaccinated I'll go well"") yoy vaccinated, even really need mask indoors.

You still freak people idea yoy vaccinated dirty anti-masker. outdoors. like isolation, nothing change you. truth 


I drove 75 miles way yesterday fuckin wapak pharmacy 3 minutes including time want hang around store after. vaccinated, asked r/NoStupidQuestions post COVID whether safe start meeting people again. told shouldn‚Äôt population vaccinated. mean, safe see friends haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet? Maybe. 

But honestly think ones left ones can‚Äôt function unless zero covid exists. 

They‚Äôll never return normal. It‚Äôs permission, guidance. lot people, like example, actually stayed home year. 1 year old son hasn‚Äôt seen grandparents year. wife haven‚Äôt seen friends. haven‚Äôt gone anywhere grocery store. 

My wife fully vaccinated, still following guidance staying home much possible enough others vaccinated, ‚Äúare vaccinated people carriers?‚Äù question better answer.

I appreciate cdc letting know science says safe(r) travel. DeWine saying they're prioritizing college students now. they're setting separate mass vaccination sites college campuses available students. there's fighting people coming outside. five weeks students scatter. say that? went Florida 3 weeks second dose. moment plane lifted one best feelings life someone traveled lot stopped year 3 months.

Glad CDC followed science wasn‚Äôt conservative. get longer insulin syringes. mean vials bigger dosage required vaccine reduced, essentially doses vial? Currently dosage Moderna vaccine 100mg vs Pfizer's 30mg. Can't expect 100% normal due large number anti-vaxxers still know prophet actually took vaccine (in secret America attack) encouraged use. Gives virus enough time mutate none work anymore. feel like required live campus??? Cargo I‚Äôve posting stories year. today posted story vaccination San Marino. Yesterday vaccination Holocaust survivors. Mostly post stories find interesting trends want follow. 

This one interests live New York cases still high. still extremely high risk infection. testing longer good metric, want know. Generally testing showing cases 12%, enough people tested. I‚Äôm curious vaccination levels impacting testing. Quite obvious, one vouching different outcome. seems extremely biased especially coming countries higher incidence rates per capita.  1 per day acceptable long ago seeing numbers like terrifying. 

We also dramatically undercounting cases, increases perceived death rate. think 70% people dying it, start freaking out.

I know final numbers, early reports flu deaths \~200x, amount acceptable death able tolerate. gotten first vaccine follow CDC guidelines, doubts we're going avoid 4th wave given anti-vaxxers misinformed people listened anti-vaxxers afraid vaccine. Prior release, concerned too, lot people got able 2 weeks ago high effectiveness also gives warm fuzzies. would need take precautions family already vaccinated? testing/trial worry anyone? intertwined, strictly prioritize one stupid. mediated path end pandemic. less flu. Let explain:

The Sars-CoV-2 virus differs flu viruses one important way *should* make easier control flu: better replicating RNA proofreading function flu virus lacks. mean fewer variants flu, fewer mutations evade immune response. 

So whereas every year, put new flu vaccine address 4 common influenza A/B variants year, *may* often Sars-Cov-2. 

I admit word ""*may*"" lot work today, hey, I'm feeling optimistic today. Chile using Chinese vaccine, seems ineffective. also failing UAE Seychelles. Yeah, lot people laughed Covid year ago too. 4th wave? First never stopped persons must face covering times must put within 6 feet others household.

This relevant text. don‚Äôt need mask outdoors time. That‚Äôs said.

Yeah except you‚Äôre within 6 feet someone outdoors. already told lived reality residents San Francisco soon step door. actual hell think spirit law means don‚Äôt believe wear mask outdoors within 6 feet someone else? Uh....lots? Lots people get flu shot every year. 

You making argument think are. mom concerned high risk relative getting kids, relatives getting vaccinated? We've shifted ""rising cases bad"" ""rising cases bad"", messaging needs updated reflect that.

Prior vaccines, new cases would almost always rise hospitalizations death. 1:1 ratio (case:death), rising cases certainly concern. Post vaccines? We're looking hospitalization rates fatality rates, important. far clear transmission still happen vaccines. J&amp;J eliminate mild cases hints transmissibility still possible it. Also there's fact vaccines immediately take effect, still transmit early on.

There's also respect thing enough people effective time vaccine. Meanwhile Canada ‚Äúplease love God see nobody Easter‚Äù I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm hoping set realistic goals. World big scary place full risks. another one added pile.  yikes selfish lot itt Lol talking about? already posted Reposts removed. multiple friends/peers work home least much winter wave getting weekly tests. Well, live France pretty much go back normal you‚Äôre fully vaccinated. wouldn‚Äôt go licking doorknobs quite yet, going dates going lunch 100% okay. truly don‚Äôt know Michael Osterholm still getting airtime. don‚Äôt deny could already seeing increase positive cases throughout US...but amount future fortune telling guy focus key details astounding. February said something like ‚ÄúI want wrong, god hope I‚Äôm wrong early March we‚Äôll seeing 300k cases per day‚Äù cheer upward trend cases ignoring downward trend hospitalizations older cohort similar saw beginning Israel‚Äôs vaccine effort. It‚Äôs counterproductive spout stuff real narrative ‚ÄúSCARY SHIT COMING‚Äù rather pose solution press importance getting vaccinated, etc. Anyway. Rant over. brothers work take one every week questions asked Well incredibly optimistic read. We‚Äôre point Canada new case counts per capita several provinces worse 25 US states. that‚Äôs low testing rates; tested rate US, cases would even higher. haha ok. fine asymptomatic also information asymptomatic infections J&amp;J trials included asymptomatic PCR testing antibody testing. (Participants tested antibodies part SARS-CoV-2 spike protein since vaccine would induce antibodies spike protein.) vaccine found 74 percent effective asymptomatic infection, similar protection symptomatic mRNA vaccine trials look asymptomatic infections, Gandhi thinks vaccines likely offer parallel protection symptomatic asymptomatic infections. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt kind testing, based real-world data vaccine roll-out, seems likely protection asymptomatic infection probably mirror protection symptomatic infection,‚Äù confirmed: ‚ÄúOur data C.D.C. today suggests vaccinated people carry virus, don‚Äôt get sick,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs clinical trials, it‚Äôs also real-world data.‚Äù -Dr Rochelle Walensky.

What‚Äôs point getting vaccinated still follow restrictions there‚Äôs virtually risk It‚Äôs going 75 sunny Chicago Easter Sunday. Oops. Yup re-did math without accounting J&amp;J got 4 months 75% total population.

However believe J&amp;J said still track deliver April, sure though, effects factory error still unknown. Exactly one said it. saying things don‚Äôt believe? They're hedging bets. boosters needed, they'll fall. Michigan's cases/hospitalizations going up, hospitalizations per ED visit winter, good sign. Someone posted another thread thought least pretty encouraging show vaccines still solid effect even cases increasing. ""What wave?""

""You've already it.""

""We've three, yes. fourth wave?"" thinking yesterday. 

Do yet indication long naturally occurring immunity lasts infection? that's thing, people actually believe worse satire sound like satire anymore confusing far I‚Äôm aware, EU never stopped export comes Covid. EU also always stresses never block exports covid programme. 

People dying Europe: said, export going amount administered EU. 
Also, know one export ban (Australia) AZ Australia, time, facing lesser crisis EU (still dumb though). 
I also read Japan asked US AZ shots think EU won‚Äôt let export. 

So please show articles says EU withholding vaccines South American countries. (This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúattack‚Äù statement, really want know can‚Äôt find anything this.) Someone tell look NYC/NJ numbers reaction whatsoever second case. obviously, mean willy-nilly around virus that's barely year old. I'm expecting good 5M dead wave alone insane levels violence ensue. btw, anyone else would bad France would've ruled public health emergency Dude vaccines work fine variants. freaking freak out. would say official messaging CDC director would constitute public health recommendations. messaging CDC doesn‚Äôt need focus rare outcomes. frequently say MMR vaccines prevents becoming infected measles objective fact. one feels need like ‚ÄúWhat exceptions people get measles mumps?!?‚Äù Yep. says 4th wave coming, party go maskless vaccinated... there's still contingent people saying end near, sure contingent full shit Yep I'll house. Still great see person without worry masks/quarantine Fair point. think issue anti-vaxx, anti-mask people hearing ""you gather"" part ignoring ""if vaccinated"" part. They're already focussing early pandemic ""don't wear masks"" CDC guidance ignoring subsequent information support agenda. They'll definitely start cherry-picking new reopening guidelines, puts people waiting vaccines unable get risk.

Plus, lot people may gotten vaccine recently waiting full immunity kick in. really another form risk personal health economy, except asking young, healthy women take risk.  isn‚Äôt reality right don‚Äôt know cdc recommendations regarding vaccine passports. There‚Äôs rightfully lot pushback concept don‚Äôt support it. Personally don‚Äôt see happening. 

I traveled last summer plan year well. Domestic travel least possible throughout whole thing. safe. Exactly. Like said, reduced risk, definitely ""vaccinated people pretend like covid exist"". main one sinovac aka coronavac 

though others way minor ones cant remember name also employed risk tiny. Even ran trial one million people would likely events. see things get missed trials much smaller. 

Most vaccines medications rare side effects. governments accept risk others won‚Äôt. Yup did. got first Moderna shot Wednesday, I‚Äôm gaining 5 percent immunity everyday LOL. Okay, appreciate reassurance. mom first one coming 3 weeks ago. upset seemed like family members guests throwing caution wind busy weekend.   fauci said beginning, things right succeed goals it‚Äôll look like overreacting. Don‚Äôt worry friend, vaccine coming. I‚Äôm 31 similar scenario wife got ours. side effects hell it‚Äôs nothing compared actual Covid. ready put behind. actually released data you‚Äôre protected 80 Percent 14 days first shot. We‚Äôre talking 30k-60k people trials (still large trials vs 50 million.  events seem happening rate 1/100k less, it‚Äôs surprising trials didn‚Äôt pick even indeed linked vaccine. already exist... proof several different vaccinations (like yellow fever) stapled passport required enter different countries they‚Äôre trying impede spread certain diseases. Thank much post! understand hard concept grasp. 

People can't seem understand difference dangers certain demographics dangers population whole. Wars changed things instant. Borders fallen people's lives changed instantly. US we've steady state long people think forever. take much change things work, yet we've fortunate enough steady long. learn mistakes apparently, shrug anomaly god forbid things differently.

I think TSA reaction, also good sense security. done nothing OK that? allow anyone plane without checking bombs weapons stringent ID verification? shrug say whatever, happen again. Nothing 100% immunology. know vaccinated people small chance spreading virus. technically accurate say vaccinated people spread virus, policy perspective effectively true. fair, present logistical challenge however like can't done. Though places world practical send Pfizer vaccine facilities available keep doses storage. Thankfully vaccines able reach people. capable reading English, infer all. Two weeks, yes. infection among aged 65 years older lower among younger age groups.

Don't much time right I'm head meeting, immune aging immunosenescence. like viral infections well older individuals. Vials contain drug products need sterile time it‚Äôs packaged, way administered. Ensuring closure/vial provides sufficient seal (sterile barrier system) crucial people injected non-sterile vaccines, could cause major harm. truly don‚Äôt know Michael Osterholm still getting airtime

...because people keep commenting him...

Ignore he'll go away. saying continue test new variants, still possibility variant escapes vaccine we'll reimpose restrictions. EU. drop AZ LITERALLY said comment. Pretty sure making (dark) joke. list schools all. Vaccination rates lagging hard, get it. craft public policy public health recommendation around rare exceptions? 

Did say that? No, didn‚Äôt.

I‚Äôm simply corrected CDC quote commenter replied provided. doctor making statement alarmingly incorrect. I'm burbs 40 minutes north find mass vaccination near me. 400k dead, China hoax better? It‚Äôs relief hear someone respect like Fauci. vaccines highly effective 2 weeks first shot, family little worry about. contrary lot complainers seem think, nobody vested interest maintaining restrictions longer necessary. Fauci buzzkill, want people got vaccinated yesterday running around kissing relatives. brakes pumped folks might one stage shots going hear whatever want hear ignore safety ‚ÄúFuck it‚Äù. 

I seen comments farther down. isn‚Äôt issue you‚Äôre trying make be. White House isn‚Äôt going scientists saying, it‚Äôs hypocrisy folks like who‚Äôve said ‚Äúlisten scientists‚Äù whole time. 

It‚Äôs issue message received. Folks don‚Äôt even vaccine insist hanging folks might it, one stage two stage vaccination decide misinterpret CDC‚Äôs words ‚Äúbut mah holiday plans!‚Äù Planning go Hawaii August go three islands. current policy need separate negative covid test island. I'm guessing policy change vaccinated people. headline pretty misleading. simply saying vaccine coverage far widespread still decent amount risk. Testing new variants continue there'll always risk, albeit small, we'll reimplement restrictions case variant becoming dominant escapes vaccines. 90% get all. 10% get low scale infection cases asymptomatic good spreaders/carriers. effective chance getting vaccined, managing get virus anyway, spreading it, wildly low. never say 100% scientific facts close possible. nice break impending doom they've also promised us. chron's disease. They're existed vaccine delivery list states. need new doctor Fauci wrong before.  Haven‚Äôt studies shown you‚Äôre 80% way full immunity week first shot? you‚Äôre higher risk may want wait shots, lower risk individual might feel comfortable 80% reduction risk. get information Fauci CDC?

And mean genuinely. appreciate response insight. messaging government? I‚Äôm troll, guy grandpa killed virus wants make sure one else suffers. I‚Äôll probably okay, even meet people aren‚Äôt vaccinated? seems like everyone know going bars without masks. 

I live Iowa, haven‚Äôt restrictions quite time now. Regardless, still feels wrong go out. thing think think infectious variants would likely encountered internationally think that's bullshit got data showing pfizer effective south africa variant vaccine 100% effective title read Dutch Politicians.... I‚Äôd stick following CFC guidance hopefully ease coming weeks. earth want everyone stay home even vaccine? Canada doesn‚Äôt nearly vaccination rollout US does. It‚Äôs time complacency even fauci predicting huge surge overwhelm hospitals. without giving age distribution 18. Without evidence reject, would believe hypothesis say Germany UK, general populations similar good though. understand people already guidances good see encourage people get vaccine. 

My question antivaxxers is, plan travel country ever again? Vaccines required many countries border covid would surprise added lists little risk fully vaccinated person. However say I‚Äôm unvaccinated come across public you‚Äôre wearing mask keeping distance me. claiming it‚Äôs fine you‚Äôre fully vaxed would give nearly much peace mind followed mask distance guidelines.

Masking distancing always much (or even more) health others health person it. everyone opportunity get vaccinated measures still need followed public vaxed not. next week changes mind exactly. even 30 cases minimal  NO. STOP READING. GLANCE HEADLINE. FEARFUL. expecting much Hopium Dr. Faucci say vaccines however produce extra strong immune responses may even better protection variants circulating around. 90 isn‚Äôt 100... Us 60 days behind Israel. Pfizer approved 16+, Florida form doctor sign-off saying someone ‚Äúextremely vulnerable‚Äù category.

Now they‚Äôre opening anyone 18+ eligible vaccinated April 5th 16+ get vaccinated Pfizer vaccine. 3 days Pfizer Shot1, nausea cleared appetite returned. question finding ride Shot2 weeks. get shot due auto-immunity doctor informed could cause harm received vaccine. Sickening. kids chance get dangerous side effect vaccine vs virus itself. Combined fact vaccine doesn‚Äôt even Prevent spreading virus - tell me... Point? helping ‚Äúsave‚Äù. medical tyranny need understand this. going fringe breakthrough cases? Absolutely. Recent data shows somewhere .01-.03 percent vaccinated people may breakthrough cases. 

Should craft public policy public health recommendation around rare exceptions? Absolutely not. policy focus needs likely outcomes. Wilson packed troopships bound Europe regardless warnings. became virus incubatorships. virus originating US spread throughout world killing 80-200 million people. Messaging bad.

All that‚Äôs asked point people chill careful months reach acceptable level people getting vaccinated realistically scientifically scared population need get point everyone wants one one. Im gonna take wild guess assume state brain drain issues. mostly agree everything said gripe still requiring negative covid test board flight back US international travel.

They even require get tested US someone know covid literally coughs mouth (as long develop symptoms) yet need negative test board flight? fucking logistics travel already know pfizer 91% effective real world even worst variant? naming viruses country origin? 

For whatever reason, species discovered customary reference scientist scientific name kosher virus. variant system(s?) revolve around P.1 B.117 similar alphanumeric sequences meaningless general population, making difficult remember. media used region origin people could place it, people accepted practice better one handy use. thought pandemic showed source racial bigotry?

We certainly seen use origin-region pejorative, racial, bigoted terms. However, also seems references like UK variant resulting sort widespread resentment violence came use country's name intended so. agree naming country (or state, region, whatever) origin probably best practice, seems amount racial bigotry sown corresponds intent speaker. believe neutral name virus (the way US gives neutral names storms) would prevent racist, bigoted people delivering racist, bigoted blame blame due. Corona theater. Take shoes off. Stick swab nose deal it. Gawd sound like sociopath unable unwilling understand nuance deal humans Variants made unvaccinated folks get sick virus mutates Early read bunch things said evolutionary pressure would make covid less dangerous [CDC data updated two days 145,000,000 US covid vaccine doses given, 2,509 reported deaths. 

There EVIDENCE shots caused deaths... even every single death shot, would give fatality percentage 0.0017%.

Meanwhile, [JHU data updated shows 1.8% fatality percentage actual US covid cases.

Winner dangerous: COVID (1.8% fatal) defeats COVID VACCINES (most likely 0% fatal, confirmed higher .0017% fatal absolute worst).

By way, putting ""Dr."" user name make better anti-vax troll.  actually encouraging. suppose might well count little victories. almost got first Pfizer vaccine dose today 4/1, noticed second shot 4/29. okay? keep reading 21 days doses Pfizer First dose provides 80% immunity 2 weeks after. second adds little protection mostly important longevity immunity. yet somehow, children mostly ok get covid. Almost exposed young sort effect. wonder would happen covid around hundred years, everyone alive time always known covid thing exposed young develop antibodies‚Ä¶.

Young people's immune system better, plain simple. nothing anything. 

You may catch cold never caught age 55. hit like covid could. doesn‚Äôt happen century scale. Europeans didn‚Äôt evolve better diseases, exposed young better equipped deal them. 

It conditions change suddenly. plenty examples this. Moths England turned dark grey coal industrial revolution made white ones stand out. Lizards abandoned island adapted food source like 30 years. 

We're talking growing wings, we're talking sudden change environment filters significant segment population. like went 100 years without vaccine, we‚Äôd point everyone alive grown world covid existed, hence people (maybe even most) get infected young, better equipped deal it, develop antibodies, making common cold foe them. nope, evolution happens 100 years right?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let's quickly paint goes.

The pass voluntary, cool let businesses decide, government mandate want touch that.

Seems great right? Sure questions. many realistically going require this? explicitly slows entry time, need ID etc, events even getting ticket scanned somewhat common. ticket takers supposed check ID? OK, yeah work real smooth sporting events piss drunk fans. 

The point clunky use LOT people, manageable less people now...so anyone else seeing I'm seeing? They're going abandon mass people going events again, even there's mandate (which states even touch, like CA NY think we're getting mandate) requires much effort people paid care. 

That's never see bars restaurants use this, think bouncer stop fights gives shit? wait staff rarely checks I'd someone orders drink?

Futhermore, think biggest overlap is. People supportive vaccine passports people want go events? people want vaccine passports want go events?

I think know answer. issue people likely swarm events ones already likely defiant restrictions virus, people interested likely cautious.

So now, lower sample size, main people want go event already anti-passport likely possible scares away lot potential venues using VOLUNTARY ap?  Assuming win race Europe US September almost everyone vaccinated, next something South America, Asia Africa? Covid still 5+ billion people choose becomes seasonal visitor, still toes next vaccine race 2022. Already great numbers see. vaccinations open people 16 feels like numbers gonna go roof rush get vacc‚Äôd.

The light end tunnel feels closer real every day, honestly makes tear sometimes. fine first Pfizer shot bit second gave low grade fever chills plus really sore arm. took Tylenol better N hour. Next day 100% think answer vaccines don‚Äôt eliminate possibility transmission. (They greatly reduce it)

To end pandemic however, need get R value 1. Stop what? Following scientific method? explained studies can't compared 1:1 meaningful comparisons. got second dose week honestly huge relief knowing protection.

Now please excuse go try untrain way overboard habits developed past year thanks OCD. far two days row 70,000 cases 1,000 deaths deaths per million hit 1,700. probably see decrease months.

To think states South seeing biggest decrease cases. NY still one worse states how.

Spring Break revving even two weeks since events Miami Beach. guy thinks we're track hit 60% immunity COVID end month. hard see restrictions lasting past Memorial Day point, even cautious director CDC US paid vaccine development world. 

I hope know Pfizer vaccine developed European Biotech company. elect incompetent dangerous government. actually took ‚Äúwhat mean‚Äù snide. Rereading, bad. Ok I‚Äôve done enough Internet today I'm refusing vaccines. I'm vaccinated. refused take two. confuses me, vaccine makes sick?

Glad don‚Äôt deal life! Michigan 10th populated state makes roughly 3% population, isnt like talking california texas florida. Also, ""in science"" absolutely need look outliers context entire system. one state experiencing exponential increase cases, couple weeks, others meandering around bottom, would say country experiencing 4th wave Michigan experiencing another wave? Please go poor statistical reasoning. ""normal "" vaccine hesitancy COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy really doubt California nation get much 80% even businesses, sporting events, bars, etc start asking proof vaccinations. :(

Look folks get flu shot every year, number arrogant, self-centered folks never get flu shot. agreeing genius: we‚Äôre solid rate vaccination reason continue masks distancing ‚Äúwe going move on‚Äù. Yes got first Pfizer today sore arm. Felt fine day (got morning). parents put ass fever, nausea, chills etc. 

I see someone clinic today get shot line schedule second passed floor shaking minute escorted away getting checked emts, conscious dizzy talking. Idk man. Really wish boarding rocket us. mean? right roughly 16% vaccinations US - anti-vax require precautions. get 50%+ yeah think overkill. Yes degree Medical Anthropology interned CDC. It‚Äôs anymore, familiar virus behaving differently expect viruses spread communities rates. Covid uniquely scary regard.

When comes viruses remember alive don‚Äôt even work way bacteria do. It‚Äôs super interesting field worth exploring! many people understand it‚Äôs taught gen-Ed detail way biology definitely don‚Äôt mean go research negative thing. There‚Äôs much I‚Äôm going able effectively explain I‚Äôm generally knowledgeable. It‚Äôs mockdown. change Toronto outdoor patios opened last week. Actually EMA EU regulator reached exactly conclusion UK approved ages. individual countries decided approve elderly thr EMA always insisted vaccine safe/effective use ages they've never put restrictions it. gave sources someone else below. same? keep hearing COVID first dose affects you, didn‚Äôt second dose bad one. it? Ah, see, guess it'll awhile then. :/ reason believe? Premised what? Check time. 

Lastly, even price universally kept 25.00 USD, might relatively cheap us USA developed nations, many parts world. 

Again, need see wider picture. Good know then, thx! got shot. 10 minute later rash injection site. assume shot. Got it.  Link actual press release idea talking lmfao. know MMR multiple doses? Hep B vaccine? can't know longer that, fully vaccinated people large enough groups draw data longer yet.

Could immunity lasts six months week, could last years years years. know actual time frame fully vaccinated people get covid statistically significant numbers. respond moderna pfizer performing much better say, astra zeneca then? heard anyone getting blood clots either mrna ones. sources say otherwise. top google results found 1 minute. results beginning studies concluded yet.

Also, getting downvoted asking question? whole point thread? vaccine lasts shorter? man 6 months? Stop. far-left populists hurt pandemic response? true. Pfizer started phase 1 trial 12 months ago. data now. Phase 3 results announced November 9 so. significantly data 6 months. Love apes ‚ù§Ô∏èü¶ç Yes, World War 1 happening time. Correct looks little fishy individual countries publicly contradicting medical association. Advice also seems odd it‚Äôs mainly countries haven‚Äôt getting vaccines? Due UK US controlling exports. Almost need another reason slow vaccinate falling behind? 

Yes total opinion US easily reports 30+ cases issues blood clots Pfizer nobody interested pausing reviewing data there? Brazil basically doesnt even test. Half tests positive rational person thinks saying ‚ÄúUK variant‚Äù racist.

See thought Chinese Coronavirus apparently cause huge amount people get incredibly hurt feelings. agree weird, given problem past diseases tied nationalitis/regions, Chinese went way rule changed since apparently sensitive countries, stick advised.

And number system actually better regional 'system' communication anyway, since cant call something ""the Indian variant"" region multiple variants. case youll resort numbering system anyway (Like caling SA variant 1,2, etc.). draw line human's positive negative rights? Great news Easter weekend! Ahh gotcha. Thanks link! Lesser bad spreading older people IMO. Deaths IMO much important cases. Insulin injected subcutaneously (in fatty tissue skin). Vaccines injected muscle. needles different. insulin needles designed insulin pens 4mm long. overachieving shots

Yeah they're real showoffs. gotta calm they're making everyone else feel bad they're good. Think poor Johnson Johnson's. Colleges accidental quarantine zones surges mass vaccine sites probably prove serendipitous retrospect. think depends pathogen. diseases require boosters (you may required get booster, booster required want maintain immunity). tried firefighter one time part process informed I‚Äôd date ton vaccines (since also EMS) made academy. able scrounge old childhood records blood tests done vaccines didn‚Äôt records on, office determined ones needed boosters for, got whole bunch shots course couple weeks lol It‚Äôs spring well. Lot less random bugs going around compared months ago. 

I absolutely never understood people get tested fun every week without symptoms. time I‚Äôve tested year felt sick seeing parents. Israeli, must say, things look really good many people feeling atmosphere months ago. things much open life getting back used be. open restaurants soccer stadiums music shows... thing noticeable fact still wear masks time, even that, talks forcing masks inside buildings outside.

If CDC says virus can‚Äôt spread vaccinated people, there‚Äôs proof case seemingly every day, that‚Äôs rules regulations take account. 
Why CDC aren‚Äôt going follow guidance? second question: yes, see ""Shorter incubation period associated severe disease progression patients first question: less clear, research suggests lower initial exposure dose correlated lighter disease course, true also correlated longer incubation period. It‚Äôs already surging 4rth wave, sure means there. Regional health chief Ver√≥nica Casado says believes already entering 4th wave, looking good atm. 

Europe South America seriously need help comes vaccines. Nah, unblinded everyone. point control group determine effective vaccine versus vaccinated. they‚Äôve determined efficacy, want track longevity, anything it‚Äôd make sense get many people study vaccinated possible samples analyze. many vaccinations? announcement story. proof shot responsible death?

August. means kids going back school weeks later. get first two weeks school. scheduled mine next Friday. I‚Äôm fucking excited!!! Ah wasnt sure vaccine using. know one floating around almost good Moderna Pfizer. still deaths Chile rising definitely rise ever again.  Considering even booster yet, need one we're even sure strains tailor too, consider booster factor much later. 

Also, Moderna Pfizer need time change manufacturing booster variant. even anticipate change happening earliest June. fake news everyone knows Science says kids part problem. gotta open schools according Science.

I'm sarcastic course. People claim Science says whatever want say.

And facts. Yes do. knew posted thread promise plenty self righteous assholes who‚Äôve sure inform me! 

Have great weekend! people adjusting risk mitigation strategy based latest science? Sounds like sound decision making me. simple valuing human life. Yes, we're vaccinating quickly, White House's messaging probably still saving lives. There's still around 1000 people dying US daily. That's 1000 many, time long ago seeing numbers like terrifying. Wait, I‚Äôm vaccinated. long meet vaccinated people, I‚Äôll OK? literally haven‚Äôt met anyone year virus. ok go casual dates long we‚Äôre distant others? ""Health experts"" experts moral philosophy questions weigh competing priorities. questions us. crazy thing NE, yes cases ticking up, potentially leveling off, hospitalizations going much. Michigan, cases going up, hospitalizations going lot. NE states' rate vaccinations (+5-7% population compared MI). Goes show effect. looks NE cases dominated younger people started return normalcy. 

With ~2 weeks required immunity shots, would predict NE's cases start plummet shortly. CT's adult population currently 45%/26% (1shot/fully vaccinated). within 2 weeks nearly half adult population significant immunity. open season anyone 16+, numbers start drop shortly. mindblowingly strange Dewine (R) next name.

Most people (R)'s busy right screeching GI Joe doll pink camo brains itchy.

Dewine surprisingly competent pandemic dodging interactions orange blob. I'd still vote anyone without (R) next name time day lived Ohio, policies last year acceptable. Yay I‚Äôm part 70%, let‚Äôs hurry don‚Äôt afraid everything. Assuming compare reported efficacy numbers (which big assumption, get it), seems like even one dose Pfizer (80%) offers protection one dose J&amp;J (66%). What's stop someone getting one dose effective vaccine, commit single dose?

This hesitate (which article say) make statements like 'oh young, get J&amp;J older people get mRNA one.' Young people worry long covid lifetime organ damage. Young people responsible lot spread, too. logistics finances, give everyone effective vaccine available (I'm arguing countries like US seems surplus vaccines)? Flat tell them, ""one dose Pfizer gets 80% protection, come back second, 95% protection""? And, J&amp;J still option logistically certain places, want mRNA.

I agree you, one dose anything better dose all. Sure. know side effect vaccine? think everyone would less worried Brazil good job vaccinations ""Relatively mild"" ...we'll see many hundreds thousands die time???

People hear: ‚Ä¶ gather Yeah pediatrician recommended try stagger reason I'd read states order enough cards gave paper copies...though take photo phone matter paper on. That's really quite true either. Since rate vaccination still accelerating, vaccinating people per day 3 weeks ago, proportionately first shots per day second shots. like 0.60% per day. could say blm protest pretty fascinating stuff. looking vaccines seems like less life others recommend booster every X years. don‚Äôt link cite, don‚Äôt expect downstream commenters put effort you. Murphy definitely won‚Äôt let way numbers going right now, maybe 20% capacity sports, vaccine passports assigned seats like Cuomo doing. *We're kids America, everybody live vaccines-go-round...* US use vaccines higher efficacy variants pass AZ. might mean extra weeks, restrict vaccines certain ages like Europe doing.

Just 10-20 people saying ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter, still spread it. Keep restrictions place indefinitely‚Äù.

Sigh.... again, suggest lol pharmacies getting vaccines months now, supplies limited forces appointment model, already sending mobile vax units top draconian restrictions leads cases! Cases lead hospitalizations! Hospitalizations lead deaths! \~ Chikin Health Yoda one said would put world pause covid gone nice strawman argument. Op said vaccine ever effective eradicating virus. objectively false. Speaking context Connecticut, people age 16 became eligible vaccine today. Numerous universities trying vaccinate students obviously capacity limited. However, specially earmarked delivery Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccines college students planned end term. JnJ use mRNA. paper he's head state - holds nearly power mostly ceremonial duties like putting pretty signature bill. US UK actually ordered paid vaccines last summer (4+ months EU) EU needed go 9734 step process buy something. approval might followed closely heels US, actually ordering paying vaccine lagged greatly. many people take vaccine? many still contract covid mild form?.

At point young people stop bothering vaccine. point becomes like flu. Always around, always deadly, manageable levels.

Please stop replying me. You‚Äôre becoming rude now. also shortage personnel, also lack infrastructure materials even store vaccines, like sub-zero freezers transporting vaccines rural towns hardly reached four-wheeled vehicles. Yes, also Kimchi! ate Kimchi, none would happened. can. Scientifically speaking, vaccinated pretend like COVID exist. That's good policy moment, that's scientifically true. Honestly take pass AZ doses, let go EU instead. really need increase supply Pfizer/Moderna/Janssen. ones really fit vaccination campaign. Novavax too, approved anywhere yet. crack rib coughing? clear, he's talking measures needed across world, one specific country. Considering rich nations even really started vaccinating people, think crazy expect world sort restrictions years untill everywhere catches up. likely stuff like testing international travel etc. Jawshon Jawshon. Yeah, still half people two doses. 3 million doses per day mean 3 million induvidual people getting vaccinated per day. biggest risk people refusing vaccine. states already trouble using doses people want it. take medical advice anonymous social media, maybe?

http://cdc.gov see, argument falls apart: Fauci‚Äôs big lie wear mask last March, approval rating *gone up* since quite margin.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* right conensus, I'd assume numbers lower they've point since March/April 2020. clear whether cases linked vaccine. even are, British European regulators said rare vaccine continue reporting updated case count, Britain‚Äôs medicines regulator said ‚Äúthe benefits vaccines Covid-19 continue outweigh risks, continue get vaccine invited so.‚Äù European Union‚Äôs medicines regulator also recommended countries continue use AstraZeneca vaccine. agencies continuing investigate.

Yet again, fuck worried It‚Äôs also landlocked country Strange. got autism 5G powers, thanks Bill Gates! lol don‚Äôt think evidence say they‚Äôre serious problem. Don‚Äôt let figures scare you, vaccines side effects people die them. Yup went immediately back getting vaccinated Pfizer Moderna come said low risk transmission. find packed ass bars/nightclubs pretty much every state. Ik go every weekend michigan amazing cux next day basically guaranteed wouldn‚Äôt get sick got vaccinated also wasn‚Äôt 100% true (pretty damn close 100% still). Idk PR team CDC feeding cuz rethink strategy. want give inch people follow rules. Let's get everyone vaxxed done all. Worth noting 80% US population (267M 332M) eligible vaccine. Since chunk going get (last checked number waa like 30% know come lot definitely go 0) we'll probably run strong demand earlier point we'll done aa practically be.

A good chunk final vaccine hesitancy crowd probably get covid contribute immunity. We've pockets surges whole pandemic. like USA surging time, right different. Michigan NE states like state pandemic surges. states earlier mean ones irrelevant. People still getting seriously ill, hospitalized, deaths rising again. Yeah new leadership isn‚Äôt great Lower dosage vaccine generates new protein targeting mutations.

It seems covid mutations we've seen date spike protein help mediate insertion ACE2 receptor. 

This means protein slightly different makes antibodies effective bonding.

It might actually necessary mutations initial replication coefficient (r0) 5 vs 3.2 that's worrying might enough, en mass, counter vaccines.

My hypothesis though matter vaccines effectively kill covid assuming get herd immunity. 

I think need 85% population vaccinated happen though we're going covid become endemic fully kill off.

Disclaimer though. I'm data scientist doctor spend hour two week reading research. Hey same! Friday 28th. Can‚Äôt wait!!! New variants + false sense security = disaster 

NY re-opening, hope field hospitals refrigeration trucks stand-by. Really? I‚Äôd like read source that, happen link. haven‚Äôt heard similar vaccines kind problem. I‚Äôm sure AZ widely distributed JJ, far know, aren‚Äôt seeing clots JJ. anti-vaxxers continue make unreasonable demands comes safety information without understanding vaccine safety data even works. EUA pretty much creating tsunami data, soon tens millions ""fully vaccinated"" 2 months, time threshold adverse effects vaccines observed begin. many articles saying though they're rare benefits vaccination still outweigh risks. I've also heard this, makes intuitive sense. point second dose make body encounter virus practice it, basically. already encountered virus, first dose fulfill role. Oversimplified course, basically true. Yeah science college age kids need vac better going someone else. Fingers crossed. think might end getting lot cases people protected serious illness. That's quick take anyway. variant starts variant? variants variant! variant! mRNA 95% effective, chances getting covid contact someone very, low. keep taking measures safe, go live life. You‚Äôve done part. wouldn‚Äôt go big crowds without mask, small groups, family events, going eat, meeting friends little risk now.  get 2nd shot Pfizer April 7th lol mean, look many people worshipped Cuomo NY one worst death rates country called governor Florida ‚Äúdeathsantis‚Äù Florida far better outcome. It‚Äôs reality it‚Äôs team sports.  read OP‚Äôs faced international condemnation decision vaccinate millions Palestinians live military control. past couple months, government agreed donate several thousand doses. also completed programme immunise 100,000 Palestinian workers regularly enter Israel Jewish settlements Palestinians West Bank Gaza expected spend weeks months strict restrictions experiencing relatively high infection rates. partly relying World Health Organization initiative deliver vital doses. mention entire world likely need booster shots year two deal new Covid variants. We're well past one year threshold, sure about. don‚Äôt understand cases like didn‚Äôt pop clinical trials . Could hid occurrences? said, ‚ÄúI thought trust science?‚Äù.

Which implies, pretty directly, believe someone somewhere disregarding science virology.

So either actually believe don‚Äôt spouting nonsense because... frankly don‚Äôt know would that.  disappointed I've American politics number fronts past years, I'm glad I'm still nation think people would tell petty bureaucrat fuck going forward. wedding Memorial Day weekend going TURN UP. long periods extended use...unless they're taking whole bottle something one night they'll fine. else going go buy handguns? overreaction, partly perception Trump trying use stir hatred. normal circumstances, we'd calling original variant ""the Wu Han Flu,"" one would think twice it.  course he‚Äôs cheering cases rising places. he‚Äôs irrelevant. Ah, thanks! blood clots serious problem AZ vaccine Covid back April 2020 side effects I‚Äôd expected first dose too. Haven‚Äôt yet second. notion vaccinated people can‚Äôt get covid contagious objectively false.

We know vaccine trials recent breakthrough cases vaccinated people still get sick virus. there‚Äôs enough virus inside body feel body‚Äôs immune response (aka symptoms), you‚Äôre shedding contagious virus. Waiting ‚Äúbut‚Äù

Always something guy Difference flu vaccines readily available anyone wants one decades data. summary today's news far:

VARIANTS!

""the Pfizer vaccine 91% effective SA variant ""

BUT VARIANT! Similar, still antibody levels charts. 

You lack side effects still good response. Yeah, get you‚Äôre saying. feels like one big Rorschach test (that‚Äôs one show splattering ink ask see try get sense personality). 

Some people read UK, SA, Brazil, China, etc. purely descriptive genuinely see racism. people see racism isn‚Äôt racism. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good call ‚ÄúChina virus‚Äù, primarily it‚Äòs everywhere. It‚Äôs world‚Äôs disease now. descriptive power there. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I read article concerning variation state Arizona. don‚Äôt know scientific name calling it, words ‚ÄúArizona variant‚Äù tremendous amount descriptive power lay people. easy remember, tells proximity (the South African variant much bigger problem SA America), tells roughly emerged, maybe something spread. worry UK variant long time get around. Maybe Arizona variant spread since vaccines here.

Not much descriptive power lay people scientific labeling. It‚Äôs academic. 

We exceeded official list hurricane names last year resort Greek alphabet. recently announced use alphabet causes confusion. Presumably Alpha2021, Alpha2022, Alpha2025, etc. Makes sense. Everyone remembers hurricane Katrina, Atlantic Storm Number Five 2005. scientific. Weird given seeming attract lot libertarian types recently Damn according projection today day vaccinations pass natural infections I'm Michigan lot friends driving Toledo (vax)SHOTS make choice children inconvenienced children. pretty simple concept. Especially consider rate serious complications death among 16 low. Good old Dr. Death good buzzkill. People checking stadiums/large events mostly security theatre. find highly unlikely they'll carefully reading everyone's vaccine cards. source that's 3 months old? Well he‚Äôs wrong EVERYTHING else comes 4th wave. interesting see medical professionals torn this. best friend due June, doctor strongly advised getting vaccines stopped breastfeeding, planning breastfeeding first 18 months possibly longer. felt disappointed is. 

Fast forward month last week, pharmacist asked wanted get vaccine. said no, doctor said safe. Pharmacist told safe, best friend looked whole bunch info. decided get soon can, hopefully baby born. doctor respecting decision said can't support medical advice. go 65 plus manitoba already Ellie appointments booked Pfizer.  


So currently I‚Äôm. sure AZ fits in. Novavax j&amp;j can‚Äôt start arriving soon enough. Thanks. people make assessments. 2nd 3rd expected? J&amp;J less effective. Get it. dude, looking perks vaccination backwards. 

The reason people urging caution vaccinated folks public risk **unvaccinated people.** science close fully proven point whether vaccinated people SPREAD virus.

 fully vaccinated, infinitesimally small risk anything all. 

That CDC saying vaccinated people meet small pockets unvaccinated people. vaccinated person almost 100% guaranteed get virus, they're almost likely spread either. 

If fully vaccinated, you, personally, risk standpoint, close 2019 normal going on. Everything mitigating risk others. probably look efficiency MMR vaccine make statements. covid vaccines far way effective vaccine history.

Literally never said anything vaccine reason covid shut world isn‚Äôt cause it‚Äôs deadly contagious it‚Äôs cause understand what‚Äôs happening know stop it.

Do we? telling vaccinated people they‚Äôre completely immune doesn‚Äôt sound like know we‚Äôre doing. required show got vaccinations various things school kid. also true many others. 
The concept new - want attend event ton people around gargantuan pandemic, need show you‚Äôre danger. like kid going school show won‚Äôt spread measles/mumps whatever. 
Christ it‚Äôs like people think whole world entirely new every day. age horribly lol mean Jared Kushner went Harvard Ivanka Trump went Penn. Stephen Miller classmate mine Duke year. You‚Äôre absolutely right Depends live. NJ cases steadily rising along hospitalizations. Deaths previously trending week. looks like least mini-surge even thing. encouraging vaccine rollout slow vast majority adults remain ineligible - arguably ones responsible spreading recently. COVID World War 3? No, that's science works. list exemptions, qualify one them. think everyone gets tested goes back US, you‚Äôre deeply mistaken. I‚Äôd say countries exemption list like following categories individuals organizations exempt requirements Crew members airlines aircraft operators provided follow industry standard protocols prevention COVID-19 set forth relevant Safety Alerts Operators (SAFOs) issued Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).[5]
Airlines aircraft operators transporting passengers COVID-19 pursuant CDC authorization accordance CDC Federal law enforcement personnel official orders traveling purpose carrying law enforcement function, provided covered occupational health safety program accordance CDC guidance. traveling training business purposes remain subject requirements Order.
U.S. Department Defense (DOD) personnel, including military personnel civilian employees, dependents, contractors (including whole aircraft charter operators), U.S. government employees traveling DOD assets, provided individuals competent military U.S. government travel orders observing DOD precautions prevent transmission COVID-19 set forth Force Protection Guidance Supplement 14‚ÄîDepartment Defense Guidance Personnel Traveling Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic (December 29, 2020) including testing Individuals organizations issuance humanitarian exemption necessary based (1) exigent circumstances emergency travel required preserve health safety (e.g., emergency medical evacuations) (2) pre-departure testing cannot accessed completed travel. Additional conditions may placed granted exemptions, including limited to, observing precautions travel, providing consent post-arrival testing, and/or self-quarantine arrival United States, may directed federal, state, territorial, tribal local public health authorities reduce risk transmission spread. sound understand data.

Let's use another analogy.

Seat belts statistically proven save lives collisions.

That mean make invulnerable serious injury death collision. 

The best strategy avoiding injury death collision avoidance, defensive/careful driving.

Smart people strap seat belt start driving recklessly. 

Similarly smart people look results early study two think ""okay, zero risk covid now!"". 

The early data reassuring, avoidance still best strategy....so wearing mask public social distancing general public socializing vaccinated people prudent course action. 

A vast majority people see news vaccine efficacy rates think like though. 

Also worth noting vaccines same, mRNA vaccines showing promising results regard others data yet. real second shot put bed 24hours depends get hit variant. That's problem they're encountering Brazil. strain re-infecting huge swaths populace, especially Manaus. Yup, mom teacher private school.  made work change policy. quarantines travel (which fine) virtually teachers fully vaccinated.  made argument one both. 

She careful since beginning wants travel (drive) spend week family see grand kids fir first time since June. 

They like ‚Äúyou‚Äôll still quarantine‚Äù. 

Then told go back really rethink position came back changed policy. noted school also excellent masking distancing cases spread. Yeah made edit. Hopefully people don‚Äôt see literally building 5 percent protection per day.

Edit: actually deleted comment. Cant sure takes literally might callous it. dying? chances infected small. Yes still chance, drastically reduced. larger group people greater chance. 

If want prevent chance infection much possible still around friends I'd suggest hanging around people vaccinated. chance (a vaccinated person) getting virus another vaccinated person extremely small. Spending time vaccinated people already approved cdc Fauci. 

Just comfortable with. feel unsafe sort chance getting virus passing something stresses out. keep mind may never point chance getting covid 0. mad pressure get tests done get age groups vaccinated. think herd immunity without child vaccinations pipe dream, can't achieved. today's case number 42308 Cutting huge chunk customer base bad business. soon one airline stops requiring see lots business it, rest soon follow. propaganda peddlers reside coronavirusUK. UK nationalist, EU hating cult. assume everyone else reddit bots, calling asshole skin back. got shots I'm brave enough start licking doorknobs yet, rascal... Assuming number correct yourself, still considering chance someone spread dying significantly higher. fact still requiring vaccinated people provide negative covid test travelling USA silly. russian sputnik vaccine accepted fda?
Just wondering cause flying back Russia Feel like chewin tin foil

Edit: wrong song lol it‚Äôs head countries implement Americans want travel. boyfriend got first doses week ago booked trip Hawaii end May right after. Can't wait! would say lots people arent getting vaccinated cause antivaccers grown covid , dont know percentages stats back up. hearsay Sure vaccine passports may legal matter time people realize discriminate minorities working class people. Every teacher PA wanted vaccinated vaccinated per Governor Tom Wolf. 113k teachers &lt; 1 month. used J&amp;J vaccine, need second Yeah, I'd interested see many women 55 received AZ shot Germany. 1:100,000 rate developing clots calculated total vaccinations, since complications seem cluster demographic theoretically received many vaccinations yet, since elderly priority. I'd imagine rate amongst younger women quite bit higher that. feeling sub dies logical people leave move on, might taken anti vax covid deniers whining sham WTF fully vaccinated.  varies wildly State. leaves many locales, especially rural, highly vulnerable variants. nearly enough herd immunity either.

I know Americans sick Covid (pun intended) whole done shit job it, finish line yet. even close. Get J&amp;J end month mean. month started. Going mid 70‚Äôs Chicago. can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs going much colder anywhere else States. Fun sun day Sunday Yep I‚Äôm Chicagoland. Shame work tomorrow Sunday going outside day night. I'm anti-vaxxer, plan getting vaccine listed fully verified FDA. Right set emergency use. one knows yet side affects are. I'm allergic bees, wasps, latex, silicones. husband kids allergic penicillin. fully verified I'd feel safer taking right now. know people criticize this, feel best family me. parts suggestions. Airlines verify negative test board international flight US. That's suggestion, requirement. recently read article NY woman got 2 shot vaccine thought Jamie Summers went without mask back normal everything fine attended wake hugging everyone someone infected saluted everyone. got full covid too.. There's need condescending, especially even address said. medical experts giving advice contrary reports? 
 fully vaccinated #COVID19, gather safely #Easter fully vaccinated people without wearing know, enjoy holiday, continue abide public health measures. vaccinated family setting, lot things. get together without mask good time"" God sPoKeN! BoW aLmiGHty dR. FAuCi GI distress, mean diarrhea? got mine earlier week, diarrhea night, chills swollen lymph nodes following day. Yea, multiple times week sports üò© Nothing wrong opinion. everyone sees virus same. It‚Äôs ok people see however want see it. see deadly virus wait 2 weeks secco vaccination. younger might take advantage 2 weeks post first shot. 

As long people vaccinated better. clarity said...""Won't see fourth wave coronavirus severe previous three"". say expect 4th wave. Think way. Pre-vaccination - encounter person series encounters sufficient infect give COVID. get whatever severity symptoms follow. Post-vaccination - encounters - 95% chance even get infected, likely much less severity. Also - people vaccinated, less frequent encounters infected people become. We're 38.4% adults least one dose now. 

Like said, 100%. personally, day 9 shot 2, couple weeks, I'm going visit 84 87 year old vaccinated parents first time year.I started going grocery stores (masked) instead taking delivery two weeks shot one. hit 60% general pop, I'm going ball games again. set risk tolerance. Shit I'd believe it...my roommate COVID positive right I'm still negative, five days hung closely days positive test. first dose get second today.  great news. Hoping keeps up! Thinking everyone Brazil ‚ù§Ô∏è involved death reporting though, goes entirely different channels agencies testing numbers worked with.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly right. course happened NZ perfect. better almost everywhere else. buh bye COVID üéâ 
I still wear mask though cause I'm vaccinated yet long time feel hopeful. lost lot nice opportunities due COVID can't wait COVID end try  4th wave definitely way. recommend this. wake fevers second dose, wake piss.  So, cautious good, know Moderna Pfizer offer 80% protection 10-14 days, improves 90% 10 days second shot. brother early vaccine first rest family passed 10-14 day mark, probably get together family safely. still mask around though.

They really say stay safe second many statements confuses people. Sure. I‚Äôm fine things already expectation provide medical records: school enrollment, international travel, congregate living (dorms, jail, medical centers, etc.) Thanks sharing info. got first dose yesterday idea couple weeks second dose. wasn‚Äôt planning anything, good informed. Yeah...some people refuse yadda yadda yadda US what, 30% people fully vaxxed? 

You're arguing semantics.  didn‚Äôt realize still wear domestic international travel I‚Äôm guessing they‚Äôll thing maybe even next year. This. Although PS5 really close.  Yeah, spreading lies misinformation hundreds thousands impressionable people puts millions lives risk sound like big deal worth bothering about, right?

/s Thank dunc. sounds well reasonable. opinion interpretations vaccine? think people take say wrong way? example: message 5G conspiracy theorists? depends level exposure. store clerk interacting hundreds customers day, i'd opt Pfizer. working home 30 stick J&amp;J. like saying racing helmet save life car crash, really need it? Perhaps pessimistic this, another vaccine resistant strain rises ugly head? Viruses tend that... whole family started vaccination process mid late March coming town Mother's Day. seen mom anyone partner coworkers past year say exciting massive understatement. long keep vaccine distribution summer going *great*! think still careful cautious gone. J&amp;J shot? person replying imply one dose protect infection reduce transmission. mentioned second doses we're vaccinating 1% population daily, second dose.

So number people vaccinated half daily figures, good chunk vaccinations second doses.

So we're actually vaccinating 0.5% us population daily. impressive still.  Yeah you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôre fine. vaccines effective variants. 30% population vaccinated that‚Äôs including people already contracted Covid. perfect actually think Biden weeds one directing vaccines go? 75%+ 65+ age group gonna awesome. Keep going.  almost tears walked out. Knowing finally protection virus that‚Äôs killed many people. You‚Äôll good! Check shot yeah? wanna know went. I‚Äôm excited see family first time since Aug 2019 dropped senior year college. Second shot three weeks cannot wait fly June! Lol good luck getting China days. I‚Äôm Vietnam similar success there‚Äôs way we‚Äôre letting covid-riddled foreigners time soon fucking things like have. moved wedding September year thinking, oh yeah, fine then. Now, I'm sure. C'mon Canada! Let's goooo. want postpone again. don‚Äôt turn news much you? That‚Äôs probably good thing, I‚Äôd keep away it. sure you‚Äôre arguing clearly don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm talking about. Ah, sorry, saw US American Airlines mentally skipped mention Europe. still think early make definitive prediction. bet national confidence US side things going surge 60 days so, hope help travel predicament. right, going based number new daily doses yesterday rather 7-day average. ratio first dose second dose shots higher past. vaccinated two risks:

1. vaccine effective (because part low percentage ineffective work certain strain). meet vaccinated people risk causing get sick extremely low. still suggest avoiding gatherings 1 household larger groups mixed vaccinated unvaccinated could still cause problems.
2. could still potentially spread someone else still want keep masks social distancing place get rest country vaccinated still studied. again, hanging vaccinated people risk extremely low.

So feel free live life minor precautions. Maybe online classes beneficial people working/have busy schedule. hell paying thousands $ sit inside houses day. Online classes cheating fest around actual learning got done. professors I‚Äôve never spoken seen faces. One classes literally teacher linking YouTube random websites expected learn that. wanted learn something like would search google free pay much waste time. "" \*\* Estimates derived subset specimens submitted New York City Pandemic Response Laboratory (PRL) diagnostic testing may completely representative NYC COVID cases. "" entire population? current rate vaccinations, get 70% first dose middle June. speed vaccinations continues increase, J&amp;J doses come online, kids become eligible, sooner, confidence first shots end month unwarranted. it‚Äôs gonna disappear altogether. second point, ur right man sorry I‚Äôm kinda upset, that‚Äôs excuse wishing ill them. I‚Äôll take back. Symptom onset basically completely stopped ~11 days first dose, implying protection infection coming even earlier. See [cumulative incidence here. Antibodies continued scale second dose (in phase 1 trials, find Lancet NEJM) probably offers even protection.


[Viral load test positive dropped 75% day 12, implying protection infection days earlier. dropped even week second dose. (+1 CT -50% viral mRNA. vector vaccines much slower.

EDIT: reply overlap this.  realize there's NEJM publication phase 3! April gonna absolutely ridiculous. Hopefully end May start helping neighbors doses. Nobody expected vaccine effective produced, tested, go phase 3 clinical trials, get emergency approval, getting millions upon millions doses arms year. 

Without vaccines done beyond light speed, would world hurt. going go one biggest medical marvels century. is, far, far, far likely kill you.

Not healthy 45-year-old woman.

I understand people getting this. GRATS! No, job incite terror, voice reason. failed. Trump appointee demanding resignation. Free DLC Republicans: Hold beer. never made sense me. I‚Äôm vaccinated, don‚Äôt care people around vaccinated not, since I‚Äôm protected. everyone chance get shot, still prove it? disagree. may see temporary surge enough people fully vaccinated. I'm saying keep mind cases started going northeast couple weeks ago, really remains seen impact hospitalizations. 

Either way, end sight great feeling. first time since start pandemic feel optimistic end relatively soon. Yours? Since felt need attempt insult. Ok, understand, think EUAs good enough need FDA Approvals vaccines.

I require medical devices use FDA Approved. example, took flu vaccine last year, FDA Approved, sign paperwork acknowledging I'm taking unapproved vaccine whatever.

I'm say people take unapproved vaccines. Actually, help speed approval process adding data evaluated. I'm trying find vaccines approved.

And summarize information given: vaccines approved because:

1. request approval (doesn't really help, ok, valid point)

2. expensive time consuming (I'm sure companies would love skip regulation based excuse)

3. EUAs good Approvals, same... (bit weird, good...)

4. need FDA Approvals (you take unapproved vaccines, judge, still answer question)

Thanks discussion me. points already knew. Although, know point 1, really thought everyone already working towards approval said, need taking vaccine years, possibly decades come. include people ever get virus mortality rate. 2-3% morality rate...going high 9% countries. doctors office second shot.. 5 minutes I‚Äôll fully vaccinated move one step behind me. really need digital tattoos Bill Gates suggesting

^(microchips :() Wow! didn‚Äôt know still places 65+. like shift lot states made open vaccination everyone help us control spread. 

My wife‚Äôs coworker covid quarantine 40s. Difficulty: he‚Äôs anti-vax anyway. Soooo... it‚Äôs probably fair say everyone wants shot (like me‚ÄîI‚Äôm 40s got first Pfizer shot yesterday!) least help Florida pump breaks spread. 

Not sure make anti-vaxxers, everyone associate getting vaccinated. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Lol that's good point. Ain't gonna margs tequila shots lol

Speak lol also expect disappointed humanity every day. yet are. getting closer closer finish line, guys. feelsgoodman. outside Philly, everyone eligible PA starting April 19th.  fear porn. like regular porn, people gotten accustomed staring every day want stop. gently offer help return normalcy, without them. uncharted territory knows much do.

Hmmm, /u/Supertech46 knows much immunologist serves director U.S. National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases chief medical advisor president.  know killing Americans coronavirus could ever hope to, right? seems random. people report severe symptoms one two doses. Yeah definitely would want wear mask planes. Also u tried botn kf94 mask? actually find less irritating? Sry irritated skin stinks. severe headaches, seizures, blurred vision, shortness breath, chest abdominal pain redness limb Nope, unvaccinated cowering fear wearing N95 mask protect themselves. vaccinated wear one. mean, alcohol also cause liver damage. don‚Äôt randomly start talking see someone one beer. assumed want launch straight ""My wife would overjoyed 15 minutes Johnson"" bit case Oddly, whole point vaccine. safe protected. stay safe. Where's 91% number come from? news yesterday 6 cases, placebo group, which...could give 91% number guess I'm wondering another release? I‚Äôm going give Trump real credit vaccine literally President going buy vaccines. 

But token, exactly Biden done speed anything up? That‚Äôs criticism anything. didn‚Äôt anything create Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, AZ vaccines. 

Seems dumb play politics issue. Last thing want Trump voters think vaccines Biden vaccine. moot point now. Places already relaxing restrictions. everyone equal chance get vaccine (by actual chance get vaccine arm time work 5-6 weeks) relaxing restrictions, whatever, zero say anyhow, people do.

And know many mutations much can/will around year. 
Do vaccines stay EUA adults vaccinated kids well? 0.6% *is* new first doses per day. would anti-vaxxer get from?

EU nowhere near perfect bizarre article. purported title shows half dozen irrelevant sections thing remark vaccine hesitancy *going down*.

I guess always market EUSucks porn. youre half wrong. true, california #1 country comes many immigrants have, terms % terms raw numbers. however, california actually pretty average far child population goes. 23.7% california 18, national average 23.6%. #1 utah 30.8% #2 texas 27.2% No, pretty much everything open. There‚Äôs tons evidence people long-haul symptoms. 60k people getting day seems fair say ‚Äúmany serious complications‚Äù. said too, got reamed it.

There's way FDA going approve AZ ongoing thrombosis saga Europe. Saying makes people angry, that's FDA going handle it.  Following State Department even able vaccinate American diplomats abroad yet. 500 times many American expats diplomats. long story short, logistical capabilities make project like work. Herd immunity global once. Yellow Fever still thing many parts world, necessitating certificate vaccination travel there. Sure, may useful see. Although we're literally talking 22 cases CSVT four associated deaths 18.1 million vaccinations. Regardless cases allocated age gender, decision change UK. Nowhere comment say need stay in. obvious implication socially distance continue wear masks vaccine(s) given time properly protect you. lag, moves twice slow. second dose move needle. Maybe did? Eventually everyone exposed covid.  number potential vaccine complications going rise number vaccines administered rises. It‚Äôs expected necessarily indicative anything. That‚Äôs pretty interesting take comment. think average &lt;50 year old walked around contagious COVID entire time? kid adult could well taking summer classes internship job yearlong lease. There's still risk even waiting longer. However, time general public free vaccinated, risk people want already it. Polio paralyzes children. choose losing global herd immunity polio covid would difficult choice. got first Pfizer shot yesterday I‚Äôm still quarantining 2nd, even I‚Äôll probably hang people vaccinated while.

Listen supposedly non-partisan information coming educated individuals government side government. Science science, long seek studies study confirmation bias; guess what, scientists biases too. never life anxious past year. low would presumably argue article. clickbait titles, please. dont worry, got loads time fuck national vaccines

Not quite. Butanvac‚Äôs technology developed Mount Sinai Hospital, Versamune actually platform US company PDS Biotechnology requires lipid nanoparticle component imported US. UFRJ‚Äôs vaccine, afaik, 100% national though. Possible, yes. likely? feel like we're quickly running debate personal acceptance risk whole thing percent positive help assess this? less people getting tested overall, proportionally symptomatic people tested, percent positive rise. percent positive remains low, think issue. think ""These people change messaging frequently"", sarcasm. know /s for, right? forgot /s feel safe? jabbed yesterday today feel like I‚Äôve hit truck. tired run down, moderate occasionally strong body aches mostly back sides. Can‚Äôt lift arm way up. Mostly it‚Äôs feeling run down, hoping turn corner tonight. Glad put good world today :) Yeah polio vax production isn‚Äôt comparable. Corona way important way people. Return? never left! vaccines take different approaches. 

A long time ago inactivated vaccines common. think original polio vaccine. cases theory possible get infected though chances low. may fearful from. 

Vaccine researchers developed approaches commonly used now. 

The two main ones US mRNA (Pfizer Moderna) viral vector based (J&amp;J). 

In mRNA case virus all, possible infected covid anything covid present virus. mRNA causes human cells produce spike proteins outside coronavirus thus mount immune response. mRNA encoded able replicate quickly cleared body (within days). 

In J&amp;J case, use another mild virus alter genetic material. virus infects cells causes produce spike protein. genetic material changed way makes unable reproduce. similarly virus cleared body soon. 


In either case zero covid virus present, vaccines unable reproduce.

Edit: terms mom, would say older vaccines like made 50s slight possibility :) true. Mutations likely occur virus spreads. Pfizer/Moderna seem stop spread, AZ seems stop severe disease. anyone link twitter accounts/blogs COVID statistical analysis updates? I've seen lot really good breakdowns linked thread Every time respond chuckle more. Hi, allow petitions. theaters still enforcing social distancing limiting occupancy might okay. immunocompromised though might wait people vaccinated see large drop cases stay low. might couple months way vaccinations going Hi Michigan Yeah... Clickbaity media nutshell... doses produced Netherlands packaged Italy exported EU. Unless sending royal navy, UK get these. Same. Fever high skin hurt. virus anything would give fever like 7 years mentally prepared ride haha 

Glad amount relief feel immeasurable. many people dying got covid weeks months ago. mean, wrong. home team going like comment.

Although think point could argued Biden accelerated distribution possibly faster Trump would have. Also, Trump perhaps would tried order states open everything now, making things worse.

Long story short, right bulk work done Trump administration, personally confidence Trump fumbled ball end zone problem individual comfort isn‚Äôt individual problem. might fine 80% risk reduction there‚Äôs still chance catch *and infect vulnerable person*. know small fraction US population US expats countries getting vaccinated. I'm one. I've told go home local medical folks. I'm sure thousands position. get vaccines sent embassies overseas? know crazy busy. Assuming lasts built adequate antibodies.

I reacted first dose vaccine. gotten second, hear it, react first dose second. vice-versa it. suggests built adequate antibodies. article Centers Disease Control Prevention Thursday walked back controversial comments made director, Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, suggesting people vaccinated coronavirus never become infected transmit virus others.

Later Dr. Walensky said vaccinated people carry virus, would discussion,‚Äù said John Moore, virologist Weill Cornell Medicine New York.

But actually said data C.D.C. today suggests vaccinated people carry virus, don‚Äôt get sick,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúAnd it‚Äôs clinical trials, it‚Äôs also real-world data.‚Äù

Later article ""an expert"" offers vaccinated people get infected,‚Äù Dr. Duprex said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre stopping symptoms, we‚Äôre keeping people hospitals. we‚Äôre making completely resistant number vaccinated people become infected likely higher among receiving vaccines made Johnson &amp; Johnson AstraZeneca, lower efficacy, experts said. (Still, vaccines worth taking, uniformly prevent serious illness rates may also higher among people exposed virus variant sidestep immune system.

Perhaps instead walking around without mask care world vaccinated people still worry health rising numbers, it‚Äôs especially important immunized people continue protect yet immunized virus, experts people throwing away masks point,‚Äù Dr. Moore said. ‚ÄúThis pandemic over.‚Äù Thats Israel, EU. Can't hit fourth even hit second. Well vaccines public health tool eventually burn virus relatively safe even unvaccinated people gather unmasked. 

You right vaccinated gather vaccinated people problem, riskless, minimal risk. hyper hyper concerned, get vaccine also wait cases go far enough comfortable.

Just saying love critical tone series comments took. simple explanation facts know that, without judgement. Since mostly women, wonder overlap birth control pills.  Seems like kids didn‚Äôt spread much B117. things different now. Reduced capacities, lockdowns? thought Europe... Joke's us even CLOSE vaccinating 60 year olds lol scheduled appointment Tuesday J&amp;J. going leave sub now. Godspeed everyone!!!! Many people seem reluctant accept things considered, AZ vaccine is, fact, worse Pfizer/Biontech Moderna. think better error side accuracy. funny say ""normal"" China, normal entails constantly monitored say, write, every single moment country. think that's great, go ahead move China I'd take US right ""normal"" China every single day week CDC literally released data saying fully vaccinated people don‚Äôt carry virus. wary calling number fake. That's CFR, IFR. Probably 5-8 times infections recorded cases. Close yet. again, eligible shot arm two different beasts. We're still good 60 days getting there. also helped pinching somewhere else body pretty hard! way body focuses pinch instead shot, didn‚Äôt feel anything gonna stop living 1 10,000 chance dying 42% Americans even passport. Americans intention ever leaving country. social signalling keep everyone else wearing masks enough people vaccinated. 

Just wear one REQUIRED to. town/city mask mandate, fuck it, bother wearing one. do, please keep encourage others keep making good choices. 

If enough people quit wearing masks, people quit wearing masks, probably little early people quit wearing masks public. downvoted technically wrong. Florida 27th per capita deaths since pandemic began. whether believe Florida's data whole different argument. Honestly, think I‚Äôm going mask foreseeable future longer mass transit/plane rides, well cold flu season. 

Not heavy duty Kf94 bc def rough skin, surgical mask preferred fabric+filter ones big deal I‚Äôm really loving ‚Äúnot getting colds‚Äù fringe benefits. Another reason miss masks! Thanks caption obvious CDC. Way really state everyone knows 5 months later.

Of course still pretending something magical second dose + two weeks. studies shown 1 dose 80% protected. save anyone else click link, petition about

Berenson horribly stupid needs nailed pillar shame eternity. Anyone ever promoted work really consider gullible vulnerable confirmation bias are. comment link -18, reply +50 We're long stretch. Around 60%+ adults US say they've gotten plan get soon possible. USA one lowest % passport holders world industrialized countries. It‚Äôs like 30% something. vast majority Americans never leave country probably U.S. already huge diverse country. Hawaiian culture life different Maine. chris whitty go fuck Wait, mean we'll find got wrong vaccine? ""Good news, 80% US vaccinated amazingly fast. Bad news, vaccines actually polio. sure made mistake we'll again, sorry."" 

For seen it, Parks Recreation, Jerry character helping send invitations something, forgot was, going *really* fast realized put wrong invitations iirc. naive then. Still lots places still vaccinating 65+. mother 75 conditions got first shot couple days ago, still couple relatives 80's go scheduled. Yeah say things like lightly.

Internationally course, 4th wave indeed occurring, wish global neighbors well. Oh, like reverse. seems vociferous *pro* AZ contingent English speaking social media (i.e. here). clear be, possibilities:

* Vaccinate everyone soon possible, regardless risk, open quickly possible (and get ice-cream).
* AZ procurement production went well UK, badly EU, justifying Brexit (and crimes). turns AZ problematic, justification becomes less powerful - indeed perhaps EU right cautious (and actually lucked production problems).
* Something fishy going AZ whole right wing / Murdoch / conservative media-industrial complex Dude taking away supply India . owed supply going third world countries. us Europe Uk need stop taking supply Vertical horizontal ones? I'd enjoy seeing shut down. hate say it, feels like 4th wave already started. Many restrictions rolled back, cases climbing, nowhere near herd immunity. past week, many coworkers quarantine! really, REALLY hope I'm wrong!! Seems like cheaper train local people injections import rich country injectors. Perhaps overseen doctor nurse make sure it‚Äôs done right case allergic reaction. guys first! think we'll able address solidly months vaccination rate chugging along nearly 3 million shots per day Pfizer aiming introduce younger age groups. read get tested come country two way:
1. People US citizens need tk tested cause can‚Äôt control vaccine take/even verify took it. (It won‚Äôt enforced doesn‚Äôt even matter)
2. define new cruise requirements sail July. I‚Äôm guessing getting test cruise requirement since added plane. disturbing. see newest comment? basically accusing mansplaining wear say people wear masks. nuts. Nope (or guess say knowledge, I‚Äôve ~10 negative PCR tests never symptoms last year)

I get bad side effects flu shot past fall Point public setting know who's vaccinated not. I'm vaccinated still wear mask go store since that's rule. interacting people know trust, need wear mask. Why? domestic production novavax highest efficacy vaccine market.. thing decades! people freaking like something unprecedented US history? 

Kids shot record go school! 

I military got pumped full vaccines basic training assigned overseas base got another armful shots. everyone vacs kept track government inserted passport! numbers back young people go ICU gets better there. another week you‚Äôll able lick toilet seats gas station bathrooms question been: 
Why vaccines approved FDA?

Your approval process arduous slow.

For me, need that.

Because one knows (my two doctors people online), I've reached FDA already forwarded question different departments. hope answer informative (a lot more) share here. Right, Let's get everyone vaxxed done all. Pfizer supposedly 95% efficacy 7 days second dose, people pointed out, first dose proving effective initially thought. Two weeks second.  long lasts second shot, care :) 88% covid patients ventilators NYC early days pandemic died virus. staff know operate machines properly blew lungs up. ventilators used excessively safety,  patients' safety. sure rollout like neighboring states transportation, Indiana removed restrictions eligibility, including proof residency. Wednesday, went drive clinic ten minutes IL state line Indiana. Got 10 minutes, plus 15 min. observation time. Thursday, boyfriend went spot waited hour half tell everyone ran 3 hours early. said almost state plates. Maybe daughter find something similar near her. Ok, why? vaccine works get vaccinated. stop caring covid move life. finally seeing light end tunnel? could say exact thing covid.

Im going wait different vaccine offered me. Canada, likely far off, supply Pfizer Moderna anyways. hear you. isolation tough, small penance pay keep neighbors safer. FWIW, R0 actually reproductive rate virus population immunity restrictions place. number changed, measure transmissibility virus itself. We're trying drive rate transmission, R0.

It's semantics, FYI cause epi's call that. Covid? stopped listening long time ago. uncharted territory knows much do. He's another talking head. Use discretion. least 8 months. least. study assessed 8 months. important distinction almost every scientist believes lasts much longer that. 16+ Maine next Wednesday, already looking appointments. Congrats! Feels good regular stuff long able to.

I genuinely wonder masks going permanent fixture society, least private businesses like grocery stores such. seems like obvious ""no course won't"" see TSA stuff remaining airports 2 decades start get worried.

Supposedly even states mask mandate listed, vast majority businesses still require them. right all, but... Ugh. fan, personally. confused guy numbers posted CDC....then saw profile twitter...  concerning tho  many win? indeed,and hoping thing. make seem like risk binary fact risk perfectly fine with, fine with, impose others. 

Taking precautions flu also nothing. think one last places remain. potential international travelers variation cases around world, could see staying while. 

One year olds generally wear masks unless meant say older that. Agreed, think it‚Äôs mostly culture war signal, don‚Äôt expect much uptake reality (except youtube views). Antivaxx definitely big concern, also expect decrease well go forward - although overall rise antivaxx sentiment bc it‚Äôs big talking point bc infected Q crowd. Unless numbers off, looks like people really dislike negativity, even facts. I'll give but. pandemic over. Unlikely next years. You‚Äôre gonna figure get kid wear mask want travel them. douche flex, ok true. So? need 100% vaccination. shouldn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs mostly public mandates. vaccinated, you‚Äôre good. feels wrong long we‚Äôve lockdown, you‚Äôre mid 20‚Äôs. Go enjoy it! Thanks according plan might happen even wait longer. frustrating many us would love vaccinated simply enough vaccine.

Never though healthy adult makes prisoner (OK maybe bit exaggeration) country 1.5 years. Maybe Moderna J&amp;J, Pfizer exactly expect first wave hit either. Corporations pushing alternative medicine,that sort thing.
They can't make much money people get real therapy instead fakery. fully understand position either person responded appears receiving second shot April 7 anyway. Afaik priority younger people 50+ vaccinated first doses instead full vaccinations, makes likely get vaccinated time. might misreading/misremembering though. Accomplished, course. one doubted credentials. famous? Absolutely lol mean different people different risk tolerance (just like Covid). point view since natural immunity already afford one wait couple days. make difference terms immunity, guarantee someone take care 3 small children. line thought, make say pretty much anything, ttaken context, throw social media ripped appart fellow pals. Sunday well, lots people vaccinated doctors offices pharmacies, shortened hours. starting see slow uptick acceleration along vaccine push get people vaccinated, weekend doubt numbers look good. hand, think starting next week numbers might increase substantially, unfortunately probably see Tuesday (as numbers reflect prior day). Thank much. much appreciated. Hope come horrible pandemic soon. Fauci famous accomplished longer probably alive. **at least** 6 months ... Tell get ArmorVax app! understanding one allowed export vaccines/components purchased us government. may mean one else order right now, means one's order slowed down/stopped since components already purchased last year. things could sped up, typically ban blocks existing contracts, seen evidence of. mean, thanks sharing definition FDA Approval. question.

I ask vaccine got EUA? first try answered question.

I ask FDA Approval is? recent try answered question.

My question **why COVID vaccines FDA approved?**

Quoting evaluates data determine whether safety effectiveness vaccine demonstrated whether manufacturing facility information assure product quality consistency. evaluation, FDA decides whether approve (also known license) vaccine use United States.

Because vaccines approved, mean FDA evaluated safety effectiveness? People say EUA that, what's difference.

Again, vaccine get EUA Approval? process, would gotten FDA Approval bother EUA. there's reason got EUA FDA Approval. what's difference (trying ask question different ways here). returned home summers may resident New Hampshire now. new /pol/ brainfart? go searching database?

More studies showing looks like cannot transmit virus without infected it. basically, one tiny % still gets infected vaccination, transmit also. vaccination stops infected can't transmit either. least, that's way studies leaning. ...yes, paying $150 fake vaccination record identity stolen seems like scam atop scam. knew since directly involved Ebola response goofy fucking moron.  Don‚Äôt forget every nurse giving vaccine that‚Äôs nurse longer testing. switch resources testing giving vaccines. state case numbers flat percent positive going up. 

If gonna give 10,000 test would give go likely Covid would expect see percent positive go since need resources vaccinate people test trace becomes less important. Same. Seems many people around saying they‚Äôll get J&amp;J. meanü§∑ I'd say get vaccines ASAP. everyone luxury. Nine people know side affects bad take care kids. know someone took next day work preemptively ended needing it. tired confined bed. Like able manage. probably best get vaccinated Yeah. Thankfully parents kids immunocompromised quite adept self protection now. Covid yet another disease careful avoiding, hopefully less concern coming months adults get vaccinated. 

It‚Äôs probably best leaving parenting decisions parents, instead creating society level precautions restrictions anyway. UK good situation comes healthcare statistics. *lot* information put national database, many scientists use anonymised data studies. Along uncontrolled spread gross incompetent mishandling situation, yes   I'm doctor, here's see, regarding distribution. 12 states open eligibility rising day (and even states without full eligibility) increasing. That's good news. numbers see tell different story. Yes, 17% (or US population) full vaccinated, great news, know second shot occurred. takes two weeks full protection (after second). one dose vaccine, could different, know. reality, 'fully protected' today could much less numbers show. We'll get 50% based numbers see easily, much know (of course could wrong, many states still open completely ones starting open, think we'll see it. think we've seen real boom. Unfortunately, think numbers great vaccination front due Easter weekend, that's me.

It might months, could like Israel soon. Unfortunately, two three months seems like eternity. non-medical prediction likely we'll see significant improvement country mid late May possibly June. going take (IMO) full vaccine push see take effect (unfortunately) vaccine doses two dose.

Due BioNTech vaccine application started today, long queues occurred front Ankara City Hospital, despite appointment. Ankara, BioNTech vaccine given City Hospital. nearly 30 vaccination rooms established Ankara City Hospital, learned vaccination application would continue 23:00 evening.  see 3x 8x (or even 10+x) stated reddit frequently, math make sense. 3x got 100 million aka ~30% population already infected. Thats plausible, 8x 2/3 country already infected. possible. We'd herd immunity already, virus would dying surging. understanding long companies fulfilling contracts, additional doses may exported. US however block buy ""first x number doses made"" soon orders filled extra vaccines may exported. result may others wait, like contracts going unfulfilled Valid point, see things transpire.  trusting regulators one country trusting regulators rest countries say something opposite. Especially really want find 16yo getting vaccinated?

here PA still phase1A (65+, compromised, frontline workers) they're finally opening now. anyone understands science vaccines better explain novavax laymen‚Äôs terms? traditional vaccine? is. leave India, who‚Äôs exporting like crazy, alone. Western country ask single vaccine them. 

The think wanted point out, EU isn‚Äôt leeching India way UK is: EU least also exporting vaccines. 
Nonetheless: shouldn‚Äôt ask India anything. White House keep walking back statements people realize getting two shots, statistically immune 2/3 weeks second. That's whole month first shot people think go party days after. Thank god! Cannot wait shit took granted, hanging out, dates, going movies... Six months. There‚Äôs way people going back get shot every six months. barely convince get things like flu shots year. Let‚Äôs face it. genie bottle. Hells bells I‚Äôm scheduled get first dose Monday I‚Äôm beginning think it‚Äôs pointless. point almost welcome crippling lung damage early death. Also people need realize need couple weeks second dose(except J&amp;J)...to 100% 

anything still good, invincible. Im delaying easter till next weekend w/ parents vaccine time One member family vaccinated all, myself, dad, another family member fully vaccinated 2 week effectiveness period. mom first dose.

2 friends state invited come week. flew plane. eaten restaurant twice already. continues several days staying here, risky this? I'm frustrated seems family members risky rest us really careful whole time. article misleading. Nothing conclusive this, jump joy yet. come fall rates COVID keep falling. Who‚Äôs going back lockdown? Jesus Christ get fuck BRAZIL NEW YORK! VARIANTS HUH?!

/s people burned football jerseys dude took knee, burned shoes coffee makers nutty reason. 

I mean frankly, they‚Äôre morons. UK evidence shows pretty safe, 30 cases per 18M vaccinations. Says who? places going back lockdown already ICU's beyond capacity earlier waves, even older populations vaccinated. think going happen 80% population still vaccinated, variants spread twice fast putting people young 20's hospital? mean viable carriers provide opportunities mutations variant strains. 


Seems without valid reason get vaccinated, detrimental overall public health. sure troll, but....

Yes, dude. vaccinated, vaccinated. CDC says mRNA vaccines almost completely prevent infection. 

Hang whomever want, regardless vaccination status. Go back normal.... follow local mandates public. Right. think two vaccinated people might able meet? What?

I know leads philosophy. messaging CDC experts uses excessively stark terms? People social media humbly boasting they've gone year without human interaction? shaming people go grain?


With last point, really think ""everyone"" thinks allowed visit people; know shunned, downvoted, etc., admit actually stayed home 100% time. mean gone trials reviewed. vaccines microscope every major country appear safe effective make (outside issues AZ vaccine eua FDA). done finished. I‚Äôm fan English football team read forum dedicated covid thread. Based content, Brits aren‚Äôt meaningfully different Americans regard. Fauci using target 10,000 cases per day nationwide long time (at least last summer). US rates dipped 55k/day couple weeks ago risen 65k. 10k since late March 2020.

The also said positive testing 5% 14+ days maintaining ""extensive"" testing. US 5% positive 3 weeks (although slowly rising back up), 31 states target level 20 (51 includes DC). think still qualify extensively testing - states notably dropped testing rates. IA testing 1/3 rate months ago currently 19% positivity rate. makes number ""cases"" look good - clearly ""under control"" examine broader picture.

Using little bit extrapolation rounding, 10k cases tested per day 3x many cases occurring total (asymptomatic untested) 0.3 - 0.6% Infection Fatality Rate would give us 100-200 daily COVID deaths potential target -- 1/5 (just Fauci targeting roughly 1/5 cases now). totally doable number. Countries like South Korea (51M people) *worst* average death rate 23 -- would 140 US population. current rate 4 (24 US equivalent). Pfizer Moderna ""far superior"". Real world data shown similar.

Free speech absolutism seems ignore reality. were, weren‚Äôt. announcement even weren‚Äôt willing now. mixed messaging beyond confusing....studies show vaccines work 100 percent reducing serious illness hospitalization, they‚Äôre unsure transmission, you‚Äôd think would‚Äôve figured sooner. still much fear panic pushed? vulnerable populations vaccinated still treating college kids they‚Äôre issue? That's works. quite remarkable people unsure that's OK. CDC literally release guidelines month ago big news story. understand... acceptable, use see vaccines? Surely think could never meet people again. burdeon proof Always. I‚Äôm waiting Sunday shows try pull doom Fauci. They‚Äôll probably bring Osterholm good buzz kill. I'm fine masks vaccine available everyone wants it. I'm fully vaccinated end April appreciated got vaccine wearing mask help protect I'll pay forward. Studies showing lot potential likely vaccinated people really spread COVID science moves slow. without hard numbers concept manipulated keep moving goal posts back Go country. Find kroger CVS small town larger proportion ignorant people. Might drive bit, appointments available. Except it‚Äôs lockdown.

BlogTO legendary clickbait headlines. capable articulating science believe disregarding? would nice vaccinated going home

I think that's whole point. Ohio lot large universities draw state students. rollout gone well, terms getting control virus makes sense get many college students vaccinated possible scatter two months. 

I'm pretty damn proud DeWine. fucking loathe conservative policies Covid response pretty good. perfect means think that's super Trumpy state house full anti-maskers. really hated DeWine handling initial vaccine rollout seemed like moment Biden came things got better. think massive disorganization kept DeWine rolling plan kept everything restrictive.

I lived worked Japan 10 years. really terrible work culture there. India only.

In second wave seeing death rates 3rd rate far.

Either increased protection previous infections catching cases now. mean really surprised people tend suffer capitalist country, meanwhile NZ raised minimum wage $20 hour taxing rich even more. Geezus. BigPharma going make yearly flu shot. Okay... racist! produce lol. 

I'm sure find funny whole situation. 

They produce vaccines rely AZ delivered 31 million 100 million ordered Q1. can't find exact figure doses administered EU (I think 80 million last checked) exported 77 million last checked. US administered 150 million. 

So yes, US produced vaccines (per capita). point still stands, relying AZ export ban situation would much similar. weeks ago full comments ""fearmongering"", ""anti vaxxers"", ""learn science"" etc Sounds like good argument mandatory vaccines me. would agree. retrospect USA, would double dosed vulnerable/65+/front line workers single dosed everyone else. would able double dose rest going late April/early May, really much delay. point late change strategies supply longer issue. think could close UK headed right done that.  kind job have? I‚Äôve never corporate job corporate friends get work pretty easy time service industry worker I‚Äôve gotten time disapproved maybe twice probably know people adverse effects rushed vaccines past (swine flu), want themselves. blame group really threatened virus, want wait bit. 

But hey, I'm casual redditor. idiots getting media attention? Yeah haven‚Äôt heard anyone got Johnson &amp; Johnson didn‚Äôt moderate-to-severe side effects couple days. vaccine, I‚Äôd probably take it, we‚Äôre fortunate enough alternatives. requested either Pfizer Moderna (preferably Pfizer), appointment first dose within week. produce vaccines rely AZ delivered 31 million 100 million ordered Q1. can't find exact figure doses administered EU (I think 80 million last checked) exported 77 million last checked. US administered 150 million. 

So yes, US produced vaccines (per capita). point still stands, relying AZ export ban situation would much similar. bothers mrna vaccines 30 18,000,000 = 0.00017% cases

I‚Äôm tired scientists splitting hairs like I‚Äôd rather work boosters need work need üò¢ Yea still big nation. It‚Äôs really bad...  One ape get jabbed, ape strong  don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs really 6 months 

It‚Äôs like developing new battery. test battery leave whatever, 5 hours later it‚Äôs still running? It‚Äôll last least 5 hours. could last forever, know fact new battery last least 5 hours load. it‚Äôs still running week now, battery last least week on. OneNote comment : Great job! opened everyone 16 Monday. Every healthcare workers elderly person know pretty easy time getting vaccine. 

Being part last group eligible, getting appointment week little annoying hard, got JnJ vaccine today. hospital went multiple vaccination stations spread around building avoid lines groups congregating, information tables set every door obvious junction someone could get lost, easy convenient. 

I think challenge might allocating doses campuses specifically next 4-6 weeks. We're supposed mass vaccination sites drive through, even appointment believe, least Cincinnati.


Edit add best way I'm aware find doses schedule appointments:  many vaccines think Africa receive 2021 then? data points reported within confidence interval, almost certainly overlap. doubt actual efficacy changed much. Yep starting day 8. Lasted maybe 3 days. Also swollen lymph nodes arm. Thinking try arm next shot, something different.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Cases high today looks like come 300 less deaths last thursday. realized (by reading comments) left comment. Thanks clarification. told older less reaction well. Friend mine basically laid 2nd dose day, mom felt nothing. I'm generally someone that's favor expedited opening, including removal mask mandates, there's something optics burning kind sets wrong way. know association book-burning what, there's something whole routine feels tribal way like. like "" old school"" immunization, mrna. However changed parameters got first shot I'm dang happy. got tossed real slow pitch pandemic compared could been. think good mountain bad shot across bow maybe take shit seriously actually stay prepared. Aren‚Äôt people still going need go Target? mental health comment weird. university pay lot money sanitation theater appears pointless...instead providing actual mental health resources address students' actual problems? add extra psychiatrists student health center, apply grant create campus-wide virtual support program, spend money rapid Covid testing sites around campus? *anything* means money effort spent something real, positive efficacy?

Or, put another way: money going towards sanitation theater *excess* money left buying medical-grade filters recently upgraded ventilation systems, supplying person campus stack N95 KN95 masks, setting hand sanitizer stations throughout school plus giving individual mini-bottles, providing rapid Covid testing several stations campus? vaccines available campus? not, shuttle system get students, faculty staff vaccination site? easy, well-publicized online system sign appointments?

If exists, then... sure, guess okay waste students' money something ineffective, *if* they're willing add services they'll debt 20+ years.

Saying mostly-pointless sanitation theater helps students feel better essentially treating like they're stupid. though fine take money let think welfare priority really - priority making *think* everything's better. 

Lying. priority lying them. Good news Ohio! Mmkay cupcake. really cannot even come counter argument facts side. 

You accuse ideologue response thorough criticism think Americans going wrong (eg IP protections; could actually go major failings US controlling pandemic within borders). sounds like ideologue here? I'm even American.

By way, how's pay Internet Research Agency days? provide good benefits? I'm done matter what. can't stop me. I'm board, want go bars restaurants takeout reduced capacity good enough. even live somewhere restrictions read reddit act like affect me. freedom. Fauci wants control. life sucks I'm trying adapt unprecedented global pandemic I'm going suggest restrictions must dropped I'm comfortable. Anyone want restrictions lifted immediately probably reddit introvert living parents basement. Please ignore poor choices made real cause agnst , convenient blame everything government restrictions.
/s  means ""learning live got work balance actually keeps [Covid] low level, minimises deaths best way population tolerates much heavy lifting medical countermeasures Got second Pfizer vaccine 7 hours ago. Expecting feel crappy soon. 

Do studies percent people experience negative side effects second vaccine? Seems easy track. WTF Germany doing? country EU faith in, led physicist supposed data driven. hot mess. Honestly idea, said ibuprofen aspirin, think NSAID medication general.

She make huge point it, thought weird mentioned heard shit anywhere else taking ibuprofen mile. expected people 25 vaccinated 2022. Great points! never thought logistics it. Makes sense. Build antibodies first shot, put antibodies use second. Faster detection attack body knows look for.

Not virologist, I'd love someone knowledge correct me. funny people find shit confusing...also idea happened first place.
Guys...please spend solid 5 mins time reading good sources read THOROUGHLY. rocket science. Vaccinations currently open everyone Ohio. brief period 50+ appointments easy come by.

Right little tough find, except deep red areas, expect last weeks. Totally agree. I'll work hour later go dentist doctor w/e normal working hours. said work standard office job, retail kids? course are, numbers really lie. differences magnitude decline daily cases/deaths significant unless would argue % population vaccinated one dose somehow major factor reduction cases/deaths. would incorrect already data showing effectiveness one dose.  Cue video guy celebrating winning bicycle race finish line add 'no need close borders' list. Thanks WHO! least reported. I‚Äôve seen others speculating UK covers cases up.

I worry may get worse. Still cases compared German Norwegian ratio. hope wrong. According Bloomberg we've hit 608M worldwide doses!

Days from:

0-100M: 49 days

100-200M: 19 days

200-300M: 15 days

300-400M: 11 days

400-500M: 8 days

500-600M: 7 days!

Still speeding up, hopefully get 100M doses applied every 5 days end month, 1 billion doses applied 26th would current guess, hopefully it'll even sooner *Record scratches* 
6 months?! Moderna developed by...? Yeah. None us really know we'll wait actual data. really hope that's true, bad reactions shots. Flu like fever symptoms 3 days. Signing basically shorter flu twice year would rough. Hopefully see immunity last year original vaccine, wait, finally get data boosters ""mixing"" vaccines. 10% get COVID mild cases

This really larger win. Even J&amp;J vaccine lower efficacy reduces deaths 100% hospitalizations 100% close to. think could good approach assuming they‚Äôve covered elderly especially vulnerable people. College students seem significant spreaders virus. Haven‚Äôt studying pill form? make things even easier. Shot pill pretty fast distribution could one number things


(1) income

(2) Diabetes

(3) Smoking

(4) Access health care

(5) Current past treatment HDL LDL VLDL modifying medicines.

(6) health care issues masked TG LDL

And betting last. Pretty much. Lymph nodes swole fuck can't even summon concentration watch masterchef ""titers"" missed memo. *used be* powerful enough. foreign minister basically joke. mean 6 months good chunk time get cases down/herd immunity people get it. It‚Äôd suck that‚Äôs takes Walgreens? seems automatically super frustrating. think part problem we've literally made logistical chore, sign up, drive somewhere, wait, really base day around it. That's hard working young people. something comes you, something need seek out. 4 millions. Viral seasonality real thing. doesn‚Äôt matter trump GOP tried use work backwards towards conclusion preferred. One fact seasonality different climates different virus seasons different reasons. saying know 100% seasonality behind little suspicious seem pattern last spring. Upper Midwest northeast problems California southwest virus seem getting much traction. necessarily, flat-earthers administration (or, least, people look like they're flat-earthers) Sorry, guess I'm used trying explain people good metric. Yep. Africa excess deaths 130k last month, one highest per capita figures world. Egypt's last update October, excess deaths 72k - probably double now. last pandemic, parades celebrate end pandemic super spreader events killed many people.

Like Fauci said, spike ball five yard line. structure. enough vaccines yet (we've ordered enough doses entire Brazilian population, getting actual vaccines whole different beast) Got minor symptoms? Unfortunately many factors play make accurate comparison. think you‚Äôre mistaken

I checked [CDC Website shows around 80 percent deaths 65 plus.

Although, 95 percent deaths 50 plus. think decade half. Oh, dang. ibuprofen thing really big deal? wish known that... data early February. Since death rate covid fallen quite bit. Mods need delete posts like Yeah, unless America really balls up, we're going forcing people get vaccinated. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed now. Feels reeeeeally good man. Bloomington's nice, think ""getting vaccinated"" overnight.

takes long time.

until then... CDC permitting vaccinated individuals travel. starting now, redditors call asshole planning trip near future... Right? finally realize saying vaccinated people could go back normal social activities would good way get people get shot(s)? one takeaway Israel's rollout THREAT vaccine passport requirements enter public establishments campuses, giving 20-somethings kick ass get shot. US, we'll never aggressive vaccine requirements (unless multiple outbreaks arenas venues), wonder means take us double length time reach point case numbers per million one year ago? ""they""? CDC said probably fine vaccinated people gather together. Fauci said he's going update reccomendations based info also said vaccinated people gather together next month, immune cure COVID standing near people! r/covidlonghaulers believe ‚Äú get it, overcautious makes feel like you‚Äôre better people.‚Äù Hit nail head best shot one get. got J&amp;J week. largely going major problem. people get reinfected? Yes. many get seriously ill? Possibly I'm pretty skeptical large scale issue. vast majority cases people reinfected I've hearing significantly milder before. wont enough everyone novavax AZ looking good 50s Handlers making shit go bc answers want pretend do. Would go public place like restaurant vaccinated eat inside would much risk you? expect many downvotes something I'm explaining understand.üòÇ

But understand correctly reason good stall use another vaccination less dangerous? Seeing cdc giving okay vaccinated travel risk recent report Pfizer effective past 6 months honestly made tear up. child gets finally meet grandparents... finally seeing end pandemic excited getting second dose next week somewhat normal summer family. almost guys!! Boring 15 minutes, I've heard side effects joke. So, may eventful 24 hours ahead you. 40% adults vaccinated tomorrow, let's go!!!

Amazing jump 65+ demographic. happy see continue rise. doubt that. means aggressively planning mobile vaccination vans, etc reach pockets people reluctant get vaccine along repeated messaging safety.

Also US reaching vaccine saturation, needs take lead getting rest world vaccinated soon can. unchecked regions rolling virus threaten rest world incubator potential variants avoid vaccine. Europe going different story using less effective vaccines need least little while. US Pfizer fucking effective time get June really matter even vaccinated consequence Yeah, I've taught virtual chemistry labs. Just... Entirely pointless. [New hospital admissions reached low March 19 rising, albeit slowly, since ‚ÄúContinuing evaluate evidence‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean vaccine prevent transmission. means don‚Äôt absolutely know sure. presenting fact vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent transmission. That‚Äôs lie. blatant, disgusting, irresponsible lie. data LEANS HEAVILY toward suggesting vaccines prevent transmission. spreading unscientific lie sake moral superiority. It‚Äôs disgusting.

If want present fact, show us data supporting explicit claim vaccines PREVENT transmission. Cleveland they're vaccinating 4000 people day wolstein center. Ive work year I‚Äôve got selfish assholes lying eligibility jumping line you‚Äôre trying tell it‚Äôs okay cos ‚Äúthey want able live‚Äù.... fuck think people like want?
Feels like you‚Äôre part crowd. Yeah agree. Ironically vaccine passport would make sense vaccines 50 70% effective. 95% effective vaccine entire rationale passport largely goes away largely matter long whether particular individual vaccinated minimal impact society They‚Äôre still saying know otherwise, so... no. go, Pfizer shot #2 today! Super excited, fingers crossed spared side effects. smart writing, mean smart science. Apparently takes 2 weeks process, immunity shoots up. 14 days stay cautious. Exactly. can‚Äôt export product already sold someone else.

If go market buy every orange fruit vendors available, doesn‚Äôt mean there‚Äôs sales ban oranges - means they‚Äôre sold out. 

And definitely doesn‚Äôt mean oranges sitting loading dock available sold others... CDC updated. 

2,239,451 first doses, 25k versus last Friday. could virus going go bye bye moot point. smart college students travel much summer could seed outbreaks probably stick writing fiction  CDC update first dose shots:

2,239,451 first dose shots. Last week 2,215,603

7 day rolling avg 1,749,362. 1,745,956 yesterday. 

101.2m adults first doses - 39.2% (up 38.4%)

74.4% 65+ done (up 73.7%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

April - 150.2m 58.2%

May - 204.5m - 79.3%

40% 4/4

50% 4/18

60% 5/3

69.420% 5/17

**Total population numbers**

40% 4/20

50% 5/09

60% 5/28

69.420% 6/15 mean, EU could done US was...thoroughly vet AZ prior approval. y'all know Cinco de Mayo Wednesday year, right? Ain't gonna margs tequila shots lol like two weeks, studies done well HUGE margins error (they say something like 55% 95% efficacy 95% confidence interval). 

But still, yes, weeks, first shot gives quite bit protection. People 65+ age group slowed dramatically percent vaccinated. like 70% slowly increasing around mark like 3 weeks. means \~15 million vulnerable population vaccinated time UK variant. scheduled vaccine 4/4. says johnson johnson. cancel rebook try get one others effective? took UBER morning driver first survivor spoke ventilator 2 weeks talked doctors making rounds giving instructions people get taken respirator looked charts knew person going told wide awake rounds take respirator. also saw dedicated nurses tending caring everyone terror eyes scared they'd get infected continued stood someone certain way meant person breathing last. got hospital done told course next month thinks must've coughed whole lung coughed much lung lining coming slowly time stopped alive. wish stories news, stories coming close death surviving. maybe everyone give covid respect demands... Sooooo many potential jokes wouldn‚Äôt trust reporting, especially Rebekah Jones Sorry new variants putting young healthy people hospital. nothing old folks vulnerable, represents much bigger swath population. OG Covid virtually extinct another month so. enough people vaccinated yet. America fucked unless start taking variants seriously.... work children present vaccinated? curious. I‚Äôm trying follow rules gatherings. mean, standard vaccination programs care from. meet requirements (and places anymore), get shot. I'm complaining outside - work pharma manufacturing. think level detail filing good, honestly inspections rigorous, looking problems places like Emergent, Merck plant, have.

I think average person idea level granularity industry controlled at. Excelsior. looked up. Hopefully perceived need kind thing decrease vaccinations go cases decrease. 

One thing I‚Äôll point doesn‚Äôt require vaccine. It‚Äôs either vaccine recent negative test. still don‚Äôt like it. Sorry hear that. think basically everyone worst symptoms like get days hang there. 

For others hesitant vaccine, severe symptoms getting vaccinated supposedly minority based trial data. sore shoulder, common. People's immune systems react differently though. think saying risk ""acceptably low"" go without masks vaccinated gatherings accomplishes messaging. weekend marks first holiday since pandemic started messaging ""whatever plans are, cancel them.""

Cries Ontario. expert determinations advising caution absence data. That's science works. data beliefs updated. better medical experts hedge bets advise caution rather say ""eh probably fine"" everyone jump big orgy pile find later fine. üí™üí™üí™ mention it, instead whining it. India also 6x population Brazil. point article mentions Wyoming, California Kansas comparison, states NE. Yep I‚Äôm getting vaccine tell take mask after. point get then. Fuck 77 million exported vaccines, that‚Äôs EU administered.

But 88 million distributed EU member states. don‚Äôt think anyone believes it‚Äôs 8x massive scale like that. probably parts pandemic approached (for example last March New York, several bad surges states % positive went 25% more), likely across entire country whole year.

Personally I‚Äôd believe anywhere 25-50% population overall, without surprised learn it. people get vaccine though. doubt taken less measures states. surprising average results.

I think worth study figure things average without restrictions mandates etc. weather? factors? Possibly could learn fight virus copying whatever X factor lead results. I‚Äôve heard people prioritized dose they‚Äôre timeline administer second shot, it‚Äôs possible people could buy card falsify first shot record trying jump line. need separate contracts, separate products; hope US government already signing aggressive preorder deals boosters secure head start first round vaccines. Ok agree: vaccine ""getting EUA"" vaccine ""getting approved FDA.""

I good confidence FDA would like approve vaccines.

If think FDA pharmaceutical companies want vaccines FDA Approved... I'm loss words... bit far there, honest. can't follow logic.

So no, hypothetical claim seeking FDA Approval vaccines. would hope could explain plan approve vaccines tests evaluations incomplete. mean, think people able fun stuff groups Memorial Day but:

1) hoping barbeque weather late May risky bet anywhere north Tennessee

2) never understood big parties solemn holiday like Memorial Day

So maybe barbeque week later? posted comment 8 hours ago posted there‚Äôs 10 hours ago. It‚Äôs lower efficacy vaccine, think 65% wild type. it‚Äôs bad vaccine. Remains seen holds variants Well yeah, obviously, cuz able blame trump time around. Another day, another great update CDC (domestic travel guidelines) regarding vaccine effectiveness, another day people spreading completely disgusting lie vaccines don‚Äôt protect catching spreading COVID.

It‚Äôs amazing people begging anti-maskers trust science last spring blatantly ignoring spread lies. get it, overcautious makes feel like you‚Äôre better people. Great know many care moral superiority science.

I‚Äôm beyond appalled way messaging gotten control this. makes sense international travel, country would confidence country's passport. summer expect need domestically US. expected nothing less lol. What‚Äôs point vaccination wouldn‚Äôt able gather vaccinated people? India 3.67 Mn day yesterday, planjing permit 24x7 vaccination, mention sub! Trying find wither Pfizer moderna appointment near pain always booked hopefully get soon guess suck, you‚Äôre right people actually going listen to? Center Disease Control White House?

The answer obvious, remember Coronavirus political issue. Yup over. Honestly time open nobody listening. Sometimes advice match reality ground. we're point even small surge enough people vaccinated next month largely blunted. certain point economy outweighs public health point. point since mid-March people sense that. Yeah one saying zero anytime soon. someone says ‚Äúmaybe shouldn‚Äôt 1,000 deaths day something it‚Äôs easily preventable‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre waiting virus completely erased. You‚Äôll good Pfizer bruh. let immunity buildup period run it‚Äôs course. No. vulnerable either vaccinated getting vaccinated. There‚Äôs need lockdown. Hate break people going start live normally they‚Äôre vaccinated. totally agree. can‚Äôt wait get back office, even happy flexibility WFH important delivery feel weather unable function. optimistic firm strike nice balance. Reposting bots like WebMD. 

This anti AstraZeneca push Europe strange makes wonder anything behind it.

Women likely get blood clots birth control people panicking....


AstraZeneca incident rate 31 2.7 million clot rate birth control: 3-9 every 10,000 .0009% .0003% still higher AstraZeneca. do. applied work communications department years ago. interviewed... living world rest us past year? covered would got J&amp;J AZ vaccines. think anyone claiming covered get either those. I'm excited plane ticket Costa Rica burning (virtual) pocket. Na aren't. want able live like everyone else. Makes us human really. Get vaccine soon bud. good you. Uncontrolled spread, incomplete vaccinations followed people lapsing precautions pretty much perfect recipe escape variant. 

Unless suddenly become thorough variant tracking, distributing boosters, break vaccine IP distribute globally, well take immediate, thorough suppressive measures, we'll back year. Pandemics never resolved quickly throughout history. dont think is.

Hard find data many young people without comorbidities died Im guessing Canada, could count number one hand.

In norway young people died rare blood clots covid.

Simply put, right countries suspending vaccine use young people. Ah, normalcy.... I'm taking America know vaccine protects long covid yet? Yeah IMO makes sense domestically another 6 weeks everyone wants get vaccinated can. time &amp; effort would require implement, it‚Äôs worth it.

After that, it‚Äôs going kill people vaccinated it‚Äôs anti-vaxxers risk. heavy percentage US adults refuse vaccinated. hear announcement ""everyone gather masks, covid over"". notably, *all* 100% effective hospitalization death! that's truly incredible. probably wasn‚Äôt much thing south, town Alaska mandatory, government enforced quarantine traveler coming get 2 negative covid tests. live island huge aspect we‚Äôve little cases throughout pandemic. I‚Äôd happy live lowered tuition match substantially reduced quality education, big engineering freshmen classes still Zoom-based in-person classes discussion-based seminars hands-on classes like nursing, yet labs. I‚Äôm online, asynchronous calculus virtual chemistry lab paying full price require complex refrigeration also microfluidics necessary manufacture.

Both Pfizer Moderna scale problems took millions dollars *time* fix also done US EU countries infra get done.

This tech exist companies like Vietnam, Egypt, Etc... 

The reason vaccines like J&amp;J AstraZeneca awesome they're close efficacy mRNA vaccines (enough practical) tech commodity scaled out.

My understanding AstraZeneca already licensing tech scale countries (but fact check might wrong) putting vaccine physical vial hold doses. vials choke point supply chain moderna. buy insulin syringes 1/2 inch needle $15 per 100 retail prices. So, 100million, would $15M. I‚Äôm sure industry makes syringes much much much larger $15M per month. 

Luer lok syringes probably bit expensive lower volume, sure‚Ä¶ want low dead space, doesn‚Äôt seem difficult logistical problem. Exactly. sure that's hard people comprehend. need vaccinations everyone first. Everyone needs fair chance. guess people quit tasks 80% figure good enough. Telling people it‚Äôs ok meet bad really. anything social distancing important ever. 

The vaccines take worst off, would hope. feeling little happy today. I‚Äôll need read her! CDC director seeming little dramatic earlier week well. drives crazy. cdc‚Äôs messaging actually discouraging people getting vaccinated. need give people incentive like ‚Äúyou whatever you‚Äôre vaccinated.‚Äù But, bureaucrats risk averse/stupid?, making things worse need be. awesome! I‚Äôm happy hear it. vote government, last time majority voted Hamas.

The Palestinian authority spent 100 million past year paying bounties terrorists killed Jews, including civilians. could used money secure earlier vaccine supply... rewards killing Jews take precedence seems. Also, get (here Seattle, anyway) vaccine card give lists type vaccine ""Janssen."" Brits would say....‚ÄùOh piss off....‚Äù something heard article explaining this? They‚Äôve always make recommendations. whatever think best."
