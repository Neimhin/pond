You’re 100% correct makes left look really bad refuse acknowledge it. No, doesn’t actually, argument makes explanation increases hospitalizations.

You basically said “Confirmed deaths down, probable”, like doctors sneakily adding COVID onto death certificates people died heart attacks strokes. Meanwhile, we’ve documenting hospitalization surges since mid-June, whether like not, deaths overall last week.

This dumb angle argue nothing going wrong major problem clearly forming. Interesting take. saying I'm unreasonable expecting child's teacher continue teach remotely ""distance learning"" phase? expected one hour per week video conferences kids? saying happy play teacher trying hold job keep lights on, teacher taxes pays sitting home nothing?

Instead hurling childish insults, providing insight think I'm wrong upset things played out? make would extremely painful states tokeep schools closed withdrawing federal funding, like gov't road funding wanted push drinking age 18 21. economic depression due sustained business closures kill lives coronavirus.

Incidentally, reason well online courses, aside labs learning differences. Online coursework takes initiative work part student (and professor). student concerned social life studies graduates something like psychology, sociology, marketing double major programming skills, that's trouble.

Trump already added $7 trillion national debt 3.5 years. moment thought going story ancient Aztec god.

""Kids need go back school little flareups, they're going dealt with"".

Little flare-ups? Covid spiking half states right reopening schools going make worse. Hospitals Texas Arizona already overwhelmed, capacity handle ""little flareups"". strong feeling you’d breaking law 🤷🏻‍♂️ there's sale avocados. cannot resist! man right throughout

Fauci always right. telling everyone masks needed before.  Antibodies perhaps last 6 12 weeks max. I’ve read papers describing phenomenon. However, unclear absence antibodies means immunity. Perhaps still could be. unknown. ... far. options table either a) full lockdown (and global famine economic ruin) b) Everything open (and millions dead). 

Everything options table. heart already damaged old covid actually fucking stocks own? done business before? reason personally makes wealthier. follow money.

Yeah, I’ve watching news Italy, people ‘recovered’ Covid still suffer relentlessly effects it, breathlessness multiple organs involved. Add short term immunity possibilityof getting *again* .....no, thank you. IL , took test first ...still results ...still sick.

The world different ways can’t see US longer respected leading nation. US massive follow crisis deal poverty, persistent unemployment, fiscal nightmare may years way. SS due exhaust trust fund early 2030s, massive year long recession could easily pull forward mid 2020s, forcing massive political question punted since 80s. Huh?

The thing verifiable “conversation “ you’re idiot. Stat haven’t seen anyone mention. past week first see increase deaths percentage total since beginning March. initial 600%+ increase, it’s slowly decreasing every week. Cases three weeks ago started increasing again. week deaths increased well. 

Cases increased percent total week since then, expect deaths see increasing percentages week. week saw 5,000 deaths, next week probably 7,000, following week 8,500. that’s percentages increase slowly. Well, shit gets much worse either arresting lot us accepting us. family roll dice getting stuck extreme-right utopia. Doubt alone. used like Abbott response COVID piss poor. displeased handling pandemic wonder things going end Generation Z? are/were pretty fucked Millennials, know learned BA really mean much Boomers. share happened Germany; federal authorities provided guidance schools several weeks ago REQUIRED schools create three plans... 

1) Full school lessons (with health hygiene requirements frequency handwashing etc, certain limits sports music classes)

2) 50/50 school online learning. (which already May/ June)

3) Fully online learning. (Which already March May).

By way. certainly don’t deny suffering going South. South Korea may protection least part population experiencing SARS1. NZ closed borders. don’t know much Germany handled it. 

Do think could handles better? Yes. Trump distracted impeachment vote. bad. think headed lot violence part reason don’t think wait vaccine. awful lot people come rely government handouts order live never enough people’s money. 

I wonder lack belief vaccine fundamental difference want continue various measures social distancing go far claim personal choice whether wear mask.

We trying stay informed. camp daughter counselor many regulations place.

Can't even imagine US still struggled. schools result closing again. approach short-sighted delays ""return normal"" they're pretending still exists. 

I know, short sighted approach insane. It’s type approach states like Florida took reopened soon. “If ignore virus everything magically go back normal!!!” reaping consequences it’s completely set back. give less month schools forced extended shut-down.

Stupid people real problem culture. Yeah, DeVos terrible human being, said terrible things made terrible decisions issue--there's lots criticize on. bothers people spreading fake quote place (I've seen multiple times Facebook) easily proven false discredits otherwise really solid argument current approach reopening schools bad one.  trying protect mask supplies healthcare workers greater need. He’s admitted himself. think public health expert 20 years service US government, expert opinion little valid yours. 

So... masks worked would prevented spread virus, Fauci sacrificed lives 10s thousands promoting mask use. think cloth masks scarfs used public 'create shortages' medical supplies. thought incompetent, Fauci thinking greater good society... Stalin would approve. government servant is. Lancet published data HCQ trialled around world important information disseminate. 

They happened publish study 'discredited' contradicted President despite world wide use HCQ covid treatment (EU, Asia).
And turns HCQ saving lives. that’s different virus different transmission behaviours.

A couple details important. largely happening Melbourne suburbs. Melbourne moved level 3 restrictions (It lockdown)

New South Wales open borders small spot fires need put out.

The rest Australia essentially eliminated virus. Western Australa seen case community spread since April 11. good news? course chinese bots ready downvote lmao  US different scale countries however. said, definitely countries scale handling better (a la northern neighbors). Ooh, ""virus makes states turn other"" timeline! Hi guys, drop car brother Wyoming week. I’m driving CT, safe terms COVID, I’m nervous risk going different states. Would large national motel chains safe sleep in, stick sleeping car? And? Canadian make immune, live US. Sucks going treated like every American trying sneak think COVID real. get paid lie agitate like u? There's reason believe death toll population going less 4% best. area yet, matter time. 500k deaths per year smoking US, 40k second smoke I'm fairly certain IFR estimated closer 0.68%, like 1 145 so. 
[See meta analysis would indicate total infection 19.5 million, ~5%. Oh man, soon. may talk remove POTUS yours. would anyone isn’t 100% strictly quarantining think safe raging pandemic? GOP lopsided supreme court voted cash free speech?

His boss public proud it. also intubated fur less time average. This, usa extremely unhealthy foods, especially schools course leads body stronger european countries schools MUST provide students healthy meals 1-2 times everyday, meals often contain meat product like chicken fish either rice potatoes, greens either water glass milk, many european countries also tax foods unhealthy dust settles, Florida Flu shorthand kids learn history books.  terrible around person. New York second highest deaths per million. You’ve got plague rat comment backwards. donate them. Usually insurance companies charged less, since bargain lower prices. uninsured many times charged WAY more, places negotiate going pay cash right there.

Arbitrary right. Another user already mentioned comments towards previous post ignored it.

P.S. Also try make repeated reports thing. Yet another example total failure Swedish strategy. 15% loss ice cream sales kiosks restaurants, favor store net bought. even remotely surprising point, still pains read it, seeing could've prevented Sweden chosen another strategy instead. Heartbreaking. say asymptomatic people spread virus, considering unlikely is, ineffectiveness face masks, potential dangers wearing them, choose wear them. I'm people wearing really want to. Sweden gone mandatory lockdown told public wear face masks, death count lot lower thought HIV/AIDS title? live SE Michigan know quite Canadians cross border make 50% career raw dollars, even exchange factored in. Half even come grocery shopping. I’d like wish Manitoban still sick full speedy recovery. Long-term T-cell immunity work human coronaviruses. There's response stop us getting reinfected relatively quickly. I'm disputing feel life quality respect income, wanted say personal income year places top 10% earners US. Charter schools places severely lack regulation steal budget public schools operate. also lack actual obligations teach kids become unprofitable shut mid semester screw every child goes school's future. hard like something much risk involved important class citizens important time lives. Regressive death cult, whole lot 'em. H1N1 seemed primarily hit college age people isn’t primary demographic major news networks. Couple competent response leadership squashed pandemic relatively quickly aid able develop vaccine variant flu virus it’s fairly forgettable pandemic. people could, going. One ”probably” plus one “likely” equals solid speculation OP. 

I think it’s great government changes test trace routines place pandemic geared towards venereal diseases Spanish Flu killed estimated 500,000-850,000 people US. 5 months, COVID killed 135,000 people US.

The current death rate around 500 per day, despite social distancing, closed businesses, closed schools, closed offices on. everything opens back up, think would surprise continue see average 500 deaths per day next 6 months. point, US would 500,000 deaths. part kids susceptible virus. adults become violently ill COVID-19, either. mean cannot become carriers. 

Logic 101. read several reports heard personally people multiple tests almost feels like results come hat like bingo call. One positive, two negatives, one positive etc. makes results difficult faith in. contains new information case. post better question? No, permanent neurological damage, brain, kidney, lung serious probably worth risk. Would want child lifelong disability something preventable? don’t show up, charter schools win. Plays Devos. brought virus supplies cleaned. essentially boiled 75 years complex geopolitics ‘Murica. Consider role US plays among nuclear nations. 24 treaties since 1959 working toward stabilizing reducing world’s nuclear arsenal. treaties based coercion via America’s military might. They’re based trust amongst countries, nuclear not. 

Some countries chosen remain nuclear. trust group nations are, confidence power balanced stable. 

Other nuclear nations, particularly Europe, opt willingly reducing capabilities. also decision requires enormous trust nuclear powers. 

Dissolution trust US nuclear power massive disruption power dynamic requires reconsidering nearly everything. ignore role trust naive.  actually estimated something like 65% now. saw one article like week ago Orange County rich county. kind people really going freak children start getting bringing home families.

Maybe cause reconsider votes school board. Elections consequences. watch vaccine miraculously appear elections then... statement makes little senses. 

Wearing mask supposed reduce chance catching spreading coronavirus, increase herd immunity spread.

Besides almost sensible people know achieving natural herd immunity going cost lot lives cause potential lifetime health complications survivors. Unbelievably sad. Throughout history church, whenever government political ideology makes way sanctuary (figuratively speaking) disaster right around corner. It’s observable phenomenon, yet church seems unwilling learn history. “Surely time different.” Really? aggressively polarized seen USA issues shouldn’t partisan, “evangelical” right divisive politically vocal ever before. puts epochs Religious Right Moral Majority shame regards lemming like blind political passion. I’ve heard Hamilton, Butler Montgomery (or least were) purple... That’s amazing! district teach said change calendar, period. person case article elderly. Mermaids. ramped testing. Cases went result started crashing.  many reports individuals exceptional stories re: COVID sub. What's solution then? Isn’t ‘tangerine twit’ term ending January? Road trip? Travelled train Saturday. Everyone except one person wore masks. 

After staff got wind one person, approached demanded wore mask. started discussion rights can’t legally anything him, refuses wear mask.


And right. could kick train, fine it. Also, staff usually tries polite passengers. Good thing, passengers abide company rules.

After several people called behavior (one man kids next also wore masks, even told guy might inclined throw baggage train next stop keeps refusing wear mask), grudgingly put on.


And Io behold, collapse due „I can’t breath it“, lungs spontaneously fill liquids, suddenly grow turned sheep.....


What surprise.... That's absolutely said. Way walk back argument. 

You condescendingly ripped guy above, calling 'privileged' depressed social distance long periods time, even forever, according many people sub. even said 100% agreed masks social distancing- now.

Now saying period time. course is, that's point people deal that. show empathy shame someone accepting social distancing go forever even long periods time without sacrificing huge number (typical) people's mental health- unfortunately, common sub still shocks every time. Nice dude, Imagine living USA. parents went school (or didn't). gameshow host, take pick one. It’s correct. Usually updated Wednesdays think. Yeah, that’s USA putting serious overtime. USA gold, baby!!! USA swol af here!  flu coronavirus. It’s flu. common cold ~6 different strains coronavirus. It’s one virus, even though looks same. That’s also get every year, you’re really getting thing.

Other coronaviruses include SARS-CoV-1 MERS. ~5+ years get again. Without better evidence, 3 years stretch given similarity SARS-CoV-2. ICUs protected simply people certain age admitted? saying person allowed shop without mask, matters you. young invincible I’ve told... It’s good ambition Yup! work job offer health insurance benefit, likely make poor wage can't afford $500/month premiums.

**Summer arrived craving ice cream awakened hibernation. But ice cream habits pandemic. Gothenburg's two large ice cream companies tell new ice cream behavior aroused corona.**

Corona turns many people's lives upside affects corners society. The ice cream industry exception. Now season shifted ice cream high season, two Gothenburg-based ice cream companies look back transformation sales since corona hit Gothenburg.

- worried corona would affect us, like companies were. What saw early sales restaurants stendog, says Katarina Mild, CEO owner Lejonet och Björnen.

Fredrik Müntzing, sales manager marketing manager Triumf ice cream, also saw sales decline April May.

- fact Liseberg allowed open also makes tough ice cream sales, says.

- decreased 15 percent compared previous years. It's really unusual.

Katarina Mild agrees canceled summer attractions affect company.

- sell Liseberg, open means much fewer tourists moving area. You also keep mind Gothia Cup Partille Cup canceled, lose many glass-hungry children would otherwise come Gothenburg, says.

**The ice cream increasing**

The biggest difference ice cream companies see sales buyers moved, kiosks restaurants grocery stores ice cream online.

- Inside city, many people laid nearby cafes sell much ice cream dependent office guests. Instead, bought ice cream grocery store online stores like mat.se, says Katarina Mild.

- biggest change seen. The grocery trade increasing kiosks decreasing. People want stop eat ice cream squeeze outside kiosk, buy home instead, says Fredrik Müntzing.

**Hot weather ""staycation"" saves**

When heat arrived Gothenburg, people applied cooling dessert sales went again.

- sun comes glass suction. I think tired laid home went ice cream kiosks could take ice cream sit park, sales ball ice cream increased, says Katarina Mild.

- feels like many stay home holiday summer, think positive. During cycling holiday camping, one two ice creams slip down, says Fredrik Müntzing.

**Newcomers kiosk rollers range**

Which ice cream popular newcomer range?

- Sea salted caramel popular. Every fifth ice cream sell flavor, real kiosk thrower. A new one vegan coconut ice cream passion mango puree, says Kataringa Mild, CEO owner Lejonet och Björnen.

- June, mostly sold ice cream, Skruven. A clear favorite kids. A newcomer draft cake ice cream, tastes really nice, says Fredrik Müntzing, sales manager marketing manager Triumf ice cream

Despite fact ice cream behavior changed Gothenburg, Gothenburgers continue love ice-cold dessert.

- think must prepared live today, need continue learn live. After summer autumn, continue sell ice cream, course, perhaps rather carry home, says Katarina Mild.

California always look disproportionately bad due huge population also lots tourism coming state taking seriously. students always ones left pay bills.

My graduate research this. countries continually reinvested education, US continually cut funding education shifted cost students parents.

The US lowest college graduation rates. Modern education competition force us (college administrators educators) continually invest money expensive contracts, buildings, technologies (like software license). 

Texas recently cut budget (again) due COVID-19 we're looking cuts around corner. cut services, students say competitive enough enroll due lack modern services.

Other countries offer services like-institutions, difference countries continually reinvested education system offset costs tuition. know long time there's vertical transmission.  need return PPP funds.

I two travel options, go train plane. 
Driving option I’m traveling destination day. It’s 3 hour train ride 1 hour plane ride. safer option? I’d leaving 6:30 Sunday returning around 3-4pm day. 

I’d love drive it’s 4 hour drive 8 hour round trip single day taxing especially since I’d leave 5am arrive time I’ll exhausted time I’d leave. people think safer choice? I’m thinking train can’t imagine many people taking train Sunday, plane there’s less time exposure since it’s 1 hour flight versus 3 hour train ride. FOMO (Fear Missing Out) concept taken extreme know pre-orders games exist luddicrious extent doesnt stop GACHA MECHANICS... mean SURPRISE MECHANICS Norway never use masks either right?

Might explain mortality Florida, far, seems lot lower NYC. Also, numbers rapidly increasing Fl seem reflected proportionate up-tic mortality, know there's delay numbers started increasing weeks ago. labs tested number people, like 10. reported positive. 

No, labs also reported 100% negative. obvious since percent positive given easy spot. Compare negative number total number.     
I noticed there's real lot labs list - actually surprising Florida can't test more.
As 100 tests positive... know maybe labs make confirmation tests?

They also talk r/ Charter schools public schools, also required open. Also, charter school employees unionized states.

/s /s /s. WTF? don’t think I’m “special”-I sharing story directly related Coronavirus. I'm thinking even quarantine, guys screwed. People going travel anyway. going get re-seeded. Ok good things stabilizing like Rona DeathSentence said then. coming Katy, another Amarillo, three us Dallas, another Abilene Please. NYC completely locked middle insane spike. Currently, NYC opened lot economy yet cases fraction peak, full lockdown. Also, mask policies group size restrictions aren’t different plenty states seeing cases spiking now. 

The facts don’t support you’re saying all. You’re parroting you’re hearing mainstream despite even cursory glance data completely obliterates narrative. NYC 30% immunity April. Want wager guess now? It’s hard read lines. Oh, fuck's sake... amount people legitimately can't weigh mask insignificant essentially exist.. know what? people STAYING HOME! thing anti mask advocate. asshole. give legitimacy. call assholes. decisions make? color diaper wear senate? Also sometimes better education keeping grades higher. example, calculus community college allowed use calculators state schools not. teachers community college much better professors state school. Also less partying distract you! get huge government bailout. corruption.... No... people exposed virus develop antibodies. possible death rate much lower infection rate much higher. know people go hospital. people think bunker without getting officially tested, bother fever lost sense taste?

That said, New York City one hardest hit places high death toll due COVID? investigate? There's picture flight without mask on. Case closed. say TenYearsTenDays wonder ROI this? I'm guessing ROI tax cuts. 35 days sea, someone brings strain 14 day incubation period asymptomatic. guys get it, 14 days later symptomatic, that's 28 days.  


I know, seems fairly reasonable within window virus's known possible timelines.

Coronavirus immunity: catch twice?

A new study people caught recovered coronavirus raises prospect immunity virus may short-lived.

Scientists King's College London studied body naturally fights virus making antibodies, long last weeks months recovery.

Almost 96 people study detectable antibodies could neutralise stop coronavirus. levels began wane three months study.

How become immune coronavirus?
Our immune system body's defence infection comes two parts.

The first always ready go leaps action soon foreign invader detected body. known innate immune response includes release chemicals cause inflammation white blood cells destroy infected cells.

But system specific coronavirus. learn give immunity coronavirus.

Instead need adaptive immune response. includes cells produce targeted antibodies stick virus order stop cells attack cells infected virus, called cellular response.


Can become immune coronavirus?
This takes time - studies suggest takes around 10 days start making antibodies target coronavirus sickest patients develop strongest immune response.

If adaptive immune response powerful enough, could leave lasting memory infection give protection future.

It known people mild symptoms, none all, develop sufficient adaptive immune response.

Understanding role T-cells still developing.

But recent study found people testing negative coronavirus antibodies may still immunity.

For every person testing positive antibodies, found two specific T-cells identify destroy infected cells.

How long immunity last?
The immune system's memory rather like - remembers infections clearly, habit forgetting others.

Measles highly memorable - one bout give life-long immunity (as weakened version MMR vaccine does). However, many others pretty forgettable. Children get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times winter.

The new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, around long enough know long immunity lasts, six human coronaviruses give clue.

Four produce symptoms common cold immunity short-lived. Studies showed patients could re-infected within year.

But common cold generally mild. two troublesome coronaviruses - ones cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) - antibodies detected years later.

""The question whether become immune, long for,"" said Paul Hunter, professor medicine University East Anglia.

He added: ""It almost certainly last life.

""Based antibody studies Sars possible immunity last one two years, though yet known certain.""

However, even completely immune possible second infection would severe.

Immunity could affect vaccine research
Have people caught twice?
There early reports people appearing multiple coronavirus infections short space time.

But scientific consensus testing issue, patients incorrectly told free virus.

Nobody deliberately reinfected virus test immunity, pair rhesus macaque monkeys have.

They infected twice, build immune response second time three weeks later. limited experiments showed develop symptoms quick reinfection.

If antibodies immune?
This guaranteed World Health Organization nervous countries using immunity passports way lockdown.

The idea pass antibody test safe go back work. would particularly valuable staff care homes hospitals come contact risk developing severe symptoms.

But find antibodies nearly every patient, equal. Neutralising antibodies ones stick coronavirus able stop infecting cells. study 175 recovered patients China showed 30% low levels neutralising antibodies.

That World Health Organization says ""that cellular immunity [the part adaptive response] may also critical recovery"".

Another issue might protected antibodies, mean cannot still harbour virus pass onto others.

Why immunity matter?
It matters obvious personal health reasons whether get Covid-19 multiple times often.

Immunity also affect deadly virus is. people retain some, even imperfect, protection make disease less dangerous.

Understanding immunity could help ease lockdown clear risk catching spreading virus.

If difficult produce long-term immunity, could make vaccine harder develop. may change vaccine needs used - lifetime year like flu shot.

And duration immunity, whether infection immunisation, tell us likely able stop virus spreading.

These big questions still lack answers to.""

TLDR: Science know yet data humanity's favor far. Considering country still idiots going daily lives like there's pandemic I'm surprised country put super mega hyper enforced lockdown. Source: Resident Q.C., people upper class subdivisions still hold gatherings local baranggays jack shit it. #letsgoCebu #letsgoQC keep raising numbers. leading digit isn’t changing anymore. 60k 70k print someone’s phone looks like bigger difference 110k 120k 130k.

People stupid. It’s something you’re going deal with. major concern pandemic need chill. aren’t going make mango cheeseburger flavoured sanitizer you. Damn, miserable existence, wonder got weird chip shoulder people enjoy outdoor hobbies stare 4 walls get worked end civilization Also Superbowl victories countries combined. mean Mummers parade New Years Day. Personally I’ll fine see go already hearing blow back whole order cancel single parade there’s increased pressure cancelation ongoing blackface issues. That’s course BS.

I miss Thanksgiving Day parade, it’s biggest it’s nations oldest. breathing exercises? something own, using something like [an inspiratory agree, wanted point others calling lower herd immunity. real answer nobody really knows! probably need realize want everything power get Covid. don’t know body’s gonna respond may one people literally nothing worry may one people going live organ damage rest life worse yet kind neurological damage. I'm interpreting correctly, 3.67 likely become infected take PPI (Prilosec, Nexium, etc prescription). 
This seem apply H2 blockers (Pepcid, Zantac, etc.). currently producing enough theoretically begin shipping 80 million Nov. 1 currently approved manufacturing. Collective good, collective good, collective good...   
That survival works.

Me mine yours. get way that, die. survival fittest works.

I dunno y'all get history lessons really need game. mine... That's always worked, world continue work.

If models account the: &amp; Mine effect, models shit. 1000s years observation show true.  hear undiagnosed cases written pneumonia given similar symptoms be. Big take, 10 year old company never produced product typically takes decade create....

Perspective matters Yeah like words ""lung damage apperas potentially permanent"" phrase thatbcomes memory. (I get sick everyone thinking theyre kind facthound sniffing trolls shills asking every random commenter ""whats source that???"" arent even making grand claim anything, saying theyve see something happen read something somewhere) also, many supposedly pro-life. boggles mind. People dying whether strike not. envy position. burning out, dying cross infection, PTSD, etc. worth it, deserve it. hold fate hundreds thousands people hands. overwhelming responsibility. also means hold power.

Is striking letting patients die ethical? Responsible? Probably not. depends philosophy harm reduction suppose.

But would send powerful message force leaders take least *some* kind action, they're decidedly *not* right now? Almost certainly, yeah. He’s also inbred. say same. OP clearly didn’t read article posted.

Edit: doubt Devos horrible Secretary Education though. Hi. girlfriend high risk trouble handling views Covid.  want safe, seems like goes far beyond reasonable. would like help know stupid ridiculous.

We people come place today complete project outside.  come house, maintained distance, using power tools. 40 minutes so.  


I wanted show accomplished, 5 minutes left.  said 'would wait bit longer safe'.  outside. windy.

She claims scientists ""dont know"" long Covid linger air therefore going outside, again, windy environment, still risk scientists 'dont know everything'. 

I claim particles suspended air, outside, windy environment, dissipate fairly quickly. DEFINITELY within 5 minutes. 


Does anyone research study show realistic here?  Thanks! IL similar tajectory hear voice head. Good. 

I know exhausting call people think doing/saying OK.

Racism works way btw. White people calling white people racism part problem. top effort maintain status quo sake economy. muh herd immunity I’m incredibly skeptical study. 10% insanely low. comparable respiratory illnesses (with similar modes transmission R0 values) herd immunity targets 70%-95%. Theory: low income Americans never hospital bed taking threat seriously due lack tangible, relatable experience.  really? source? i've heard debunked - quite opposite. see typing invective, evidence existing studies data.

Pediatricians taken account totality evidence, including things like hunger, child abuse, social development, education conclude better children return school (with proper precautions).

However, unlike you, presume chose, position privilege, proper course children.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* two ships, right?

No. Completely agree, system living in. call lot employers ""non-essential"" basically telling workers healthcare also non-essential. not? CA, think “tried” strong word citizens “quarantined.” Good news 132 deaths reported today! That's states densely populated got hit first people fully prepared. Florida Arizona months get shit sorted failed spectacularly. I'd bet time next year per capita deaths far worse states NY NJ. President siding host Love Connection appointed accredited Dr's Scientists 

Regarding pandemic exponentially killing people daily 

The Love Connection. I’m sure people got counted covid deaths appropriately counted something else. part overall mortality figures. data shows, example, US nearly 100,000 people die mid February early May usual, contention? agree 70,000 people covid deaths misdiagnosed. leaves excess deaths probably uncounted covid deaths anyway. also claim lot excess deaths came side effect pandemic (people died getting treatment due overpacked hospitals etc) sure buy that’s real direct price pandemic still. matter cut it, looking data something huge deadly happened America March April May thing covid. unfortunately it’s taken seriously coming back e got numbers really low kept low, states data gear have, number climb

And, know, 40% state infected probably helps bit preventing spread. no, yeah, due data science. went doctor time opened day, despite notice door building, whole bunch people let inside wearing mask. found grouped around doorway one room masks handed out. guy, fixing receptionists' computer wearing mask, though everyone else wear one eventually. shocked blase attitude DOCTORS OFFICE! intend see doctor unless absolutely to, seemed like good way get sick. Actually, three vaccine candidates moving phase 3 already: Oxford/AstraZeneca, Sinopharm Sinovac, Moderna BioNTech/Pfizer/Fosun completed phase 2 expecting move phase 3 soon. Gamaleya center (the one article about) finished phase 1 far. spelled America wrong make sense.

If days matter, take literally months cases surge Florida? surge exactly time California's did?

You two states - one hold waiting long, another hold early, experienced curve (in case months cases started coming in). That's even close coherent conceptualization happened why.

And that's even addressing states like Illinois, who, again, hold acting early, death counts way 2x states hold acting late (and Cook County cases county country).

If lockdowns work ""days matter"", that? Florida get slammed late March early April? happen protests and/or bars reopening (whichever preferred narrative is)?

You lot work construct coherent narrative around this.

Regardless, certainly can't case failure due lack information (at least Florida). anything, government authorities WAY, WAY overestimated lethality virus. Current estimates IFR somewhere around 0.2%. That's nothing, nowhere close numbers told March. speak family, grandma dies, trailer Appalachia rotting bathroom floor, mold everywhere, roach infestation. that’s it. cousins (and mom matter) don’t care life hopeless thing pleasures present moment forget grandma (who stage 2 lung cancer top it). trailer uninhabitable even though still live it, it’s like they’d get anything “hope dies, get inheritance,” simply can’t process caring spreading disease. vote Democrat (at least haven’t adjudicated mentally defective), can’t even say that’s Republican thing.

Meanwhile, haven’t see family since plague can’t understand won’t go take kids there. “Um, take care coronavirus patients, healthy. there’s anyone would asymptomatic spreader, would me, don’t want one take there.” That’s true first-world country days. “best” specialized care tied, rest hopelessly worse.  human testing done yet

So...they nothing  Well, I'm absolute layman issues. assume immunity really short-lived (at least natural immunity), case?

The duration immune response would similar common cold, disease far serious.

This seems unintuitive behaviour virus, opinion.

If reports true, hope possible get better immune reactions vaccines. Read article, look icon, big fat ""FALSE"" stamped it. never said (in form, either .02% students overall, .02% students infected COVID, latter would hundred cases might actually accurate). Arizona #1 accounting per capita. Florida #2 far everyone else  Nah -- U.S. brainwashed, China Russia -- places better. need reign idiot nations. know lot reddit rooting this, think there's precautions taken western southern states New York March.   could done more, but, mask requirements lots people wearing masks restricting activity.  think anybody's going catch northeast's per capita death numbers. issues rare. social ill American culture. always individual group. Fighting pandemic requires personal sacrifice, valuing well community comfort convenience individual. That's countries Americans call ""socialist"" handling much better America. Look Canada - far perfect, social cohesion country led far better control spread. friends video? hell weather? know NY leads deaths second place far far away ? Yeah. Credit cards, even debit cards really nice this. However, bought using frequent flyer account membership account might suspend account retaliation. Otherwise, basically can't anything try sue small claims going happen lol. first wave stopped hard put sequential order. Second wave would sometime one clearly controlled, gotten close point yet. Even NY seeing 700 day. Fixed title: **‘We Can’t Sacrifice Children’s Future Pandemic, children’** think catch someone breaking Alaska loophole deport them, Alaska, ban car pandemic over. Sure, fly back lower 48, good luck getting car back.  Ah, letting die schools protecting future.

Hope give mask take care social distancing knowing anti intellectual movement America people sems ignore facts sciences doubt would even work Yeah, run scientists listens them?

Subcontract Apple. there's warning use iPhone wearing mask. Pretty sure guy knows much you. read fear mongering articles, he’s actually qualified opinion. like many states soon restrictions lifted sorta went back mostly
Normal. Wearing mask optional mostly cases continue drop Maine, fact Maine rural saving lol Ugh. Europe? First place I'd (try to) go New Zealand. Second choice would Canada.

Not either country would take me. sayin'. it’s good enough Yes. says virus gone killed vulnerable. That's kind spit face oath take, I'm sure there's bad apple somewhere along line, pretty bold assume doctors want people risk something like line pockets. likely either coerced, understand risks better/differently do.

I send kid school personally, I'm convinced doctors mad capitalist supervillains preying lives children. Lol would read article dipshits would accuse reading anyway?

But yea. hang here, buddy. Cause you’re stupid one. Ehhhh debatable. We're inviting tourists request either quarantine (no real mandate). Or, want quarantine, need test negative within last 3 days they're free whatever. I'd feel comfortable mandated quarantine bring tourists they'll never it. 

We're seeing small increase expect we'll soon meet 5% rate we're quarantining others haha Wrong. administrative costs huge due ignorant tax payers legislators passing laws requiring universities abide by, implement, report range policies, laws requirements. zero idea sheer amount laws universities abide by, faculty member experts areas well experts field study — it’s simply impossible. hire staff build purchase systems don’t get sued huge fines leveled Federal state government. every university understaffed time, every one. staff admins making fraction could make private sector working 2x much. sister makes $300k working private company high level job. leaves everyday right time. work university making less 1/3 makes regularly work 10-12 hr days. 

Space super tight universities. faculty staff offices; there’s MDs PhDs sharing small office spaces regular. simply room., it’s space prioritized students luxury amenities. spend whole career staff member never small office. They’re building research space; every university research needs lab clinical research spaces, animal facilities, etc. That’s build for. universities building “pretty” buildings, it’s generally received gift donor students expecting spaces. 

And problem defunding higher education point 60% funding comes student tuition put universities position compete one another. It’s longer ok focused undergrads vs research 1st generation college students teaching liberal arts curriculum. No, every university try get research game set lofty goals becoming top tier research institution. compete “customers”, ie students, now. pay million-dollar marketing campaigns. build fancy gyms, etc undergrads families fall shit.

And no, universities don’t “make money” research. non-profits, universities legally cannot make huge profits. never recoup full costs research; grants contracts come capped overhead quite bit lower actual cost maintaining buildings, paying staff make sure they’re abiding federal state rules, animal subject costs, general office supplies (not allowed charged Federal grants), far, far costs. sport facilities costly income events vital funding stream, lack tax dollars, helps keep tuition costs fees down.

Nobody getting rich working university. even surgeons making half million — they’re making far less could private healthcare system hospital private practice. High level administrators make $100-300k they’re lucky; also work 100 hr weeks would get paid far private sector. Staff post docs lab techs make $25-70k also working 40 hrs/week. believe value higher education want something matters — helping faculty make breakthroughs cancer research, helping students become independent researchers, etc. I’ve worked academia 15 yrs, I’ve never met administrator pulling high salary didn’t absolutely punishing schedule. 

It’s incredibly sad many people see little value universities do. institutions whose sole purpose cultivate share knowledge, make tremendous innovations breakthroughs (and no, faculty don’t become rich make huge discovery field commercialize IP; doesn’t work way), help people age, race, religion, political affiliation, sex, gener identity, etc expand minds grow. That’s it. Universities don’t exist make profit sell much product can. They’re public good, yet people like deride people work exactly? intelligence makes feel inferior guess. yes /CruiseChallenge agree tested everyone. Two years see long immunity lasts. 

If safety general efficiency proven, emergency roll outs start sooner. That's scale months.

Efficiency determined predetermined number get sick. Then, number sick compared vaccine placebo group. See, possible nay sayers. like wearing seat belt. I’ve heard that’s Clemson football doing. Get illness season starts sanitisers made taste bad then, using hands, skin soaks bitter taste, even hands dry taste goes away quickly. food requires hand use, licking. testing limited  practicing rights? Good point, taken consideration. However, many young people aren’t taking virus seriously large gatherings contribute spread. need 25 kills nuke though mis read can't looking pasty quarantined + outline mask getting tan? dare you! Waiting masters give new sturdier talking points parrot. Ok, hear out. Think bandwidth would freed up. honestly don’t understand she’s thinking....I know many people want schools open. Parents tired, jobs need employees (so say), + want economy return normal. 

The economy doesn’t work vacuum independent humans. virus spreading + leading disruption status quo + every day care making economy work NEEDS shut least regulations need put place ensure virus spread minimized (they barely even minimum direction). Schools far dangerous places open right now. 

Also....has Miss DeVos seen children cough? Same. made decision long ago found working conditions everything skirt state labor safety laws. call ambulance worker seriously hurt. call Uber. 'rona, Tesla going complete 180 stay way ever buy one. Exactly. shoot driver car, I’ve killed one person. car crashes bridge, drowning 3 passengers, would say killed 4 people since actions directly led 3 additional deaths.  It’s was. didn’t complain it, nothing could do. adapt. what’s missing. seems concept adaptation. 

Like wearing mask? Yeah, sounds like totally prepared second wave! LoOk NeW YOrK!

Yeah, something it. look now. new things southern states now? None? Oh doubling strategies brought exact moment? 🤦‍♂️ Given Hotels getting vouchers city, ""profit"" motive would imply keep spending public dollars no? ""profits"" talking specifically? think biggest eye roll moment information spread around protests rioting prevented coronavirus scaring people staying home. Like ...get fuck outta that...so allow anarchy people stay home? nuts. I'm saying true. asking fair, I'd want know screwed up, think there's enough people read approached reasonable manner. see vast conspiracy write virus hoax. thank texas sacrificing prove rona hoax discredit prez orlando new Lombardi Can't go developmental stages dead. That’s kids end last year. Worked quite well. Nope. That's sucks. stupid video eating BBQ climbing rock wall something.  adoption** policies requiring face coverings public settings **should** **considered** reduce impact magnitude additional waves COVID-19,” study published CDC says.

Look weasel words here.

If Centers Disease Control Prevention integrity all, they'd make clear, concise, unqualified recommendations since they, know, prevent diseases. 

""We recommend nationwide face mask requirement immediately. Failing that, mandated facemask adoption policies based infection rates measurable, objective criteria.""

Should, maybe, possibly, good idea. 

That time 130,000 corpses ago. people can't bring say anything might actually help someone lest incur ire wretch charge. *couldn't* care less. *could* care *less*, still care somewhat. I’ve watching people know MA, including friends, think numbers low means run around whatever anyone. also means ditching some, all, covid precautions. 

All work nothing feels like. People need get grip serious this. need restrictions people can’t grasp idiots. almost like can't gaslight virus give f@ck feelings, something. weird! paying attention wondered someone would call Donald J Trump ""JT"".  Maybe virus brain already shot. like Schrodinger's virus. get it, know bad going be. friend ventilated recovered. months later still trouble breathing. Life returned normal them, ""low risk"". want gamble life health. despite low risk well, take every precaution. respect anyone same. overwhelmed ICU COVID patients. large sections use get shut down.

COVID utilizing many general surgeons OB surgeons orthopedics docs, can't work situation, PPE shortages able separate COVID patients whatever.

At point Texas Florida even testing become factor. results take week get back, thats incredibly dangerous situation bring surgery patient hospital under.

This well documented revenues hospitals COVID, id suggest Google g around articles coming back still confused. They're afraid say becoming obvious: get multiple times, potentially worse second time.

Expect acknowledge reinfection millions people twice. man downvoted, probably means wrong.

I'm NB, also got relatively lightly, I've noticed real increase seriously people taking around since things started spiral south. People laughed getting COVID test months back edgily asking I'm sure I'm 'over it', even though never actually it, amusing.

Whatever reason increased vigilance, I'll take - want anywhere Canada next 'we thought happen here'. wrong. march 2020, Norway:

Sweden nothing like except two last measures, much less strain (and results). events cancelled gathering 50 persons ban - deemed sufficient fight global pandemic. Restaurants bars remained opened. Even one got fine reopened thereafter. bird CIA op. Charlie Baker great job commonwealth... thank Governor That's yes. Poor guy know whose running year's election. Well Donner party also failed heed attempts warn them. Members Donner party ate dead keep alive (barely), GOP basically saying cannibalize old, oh wait, anyone 40, maybe 30, let’s throw school kids too, sick, underlying conditions, dead, sake keeping economy alive (which working).

[Literally tons Eat rich see NFL gets proposed season. imagine virus running rampant 


Kind like game last season eagles beat cowgirls division. Run.ing.ramp.ant   Oh, talking ""any country general"" realize talking United States specifically. apologies confusion. let's talk US 1. Since US effective last time ...

The US whole never strict lockdown. I'm looking state/city specifically, hardly anywhere completely shut everything forced people stay home. Various parts US shut varying degrees period time. 

When say ""strict lockdown"" I'm talking something along lines of: leaving home go grocery store, pharmacy, doctor emergency, places strictly controlling number people extremely low level given time. US people going Wal-Mart hanging nothing better people do. None that. get need get out. like 4 5 people/families supercenter-style store time, 1 2 convinience-style/pharmacy time. maybe even mandate brick mortar stores open all, everything would done no-contact delivery.

Look, I'm spitballing estimates top head here, things would need refined degree. I'm trying give idea difference US before, would need done effectively deal situation.

But wait! US *did* kind half-assed lockdown already, may point out. Yes, did. know what? yeilded results. half-assed results half-assed lockdown. Cases increasing exponential rate lockdowns began, gradually began slow down, stabilize, began gradually fall.

However, rates starting fall states began re-open. sure enough typical delay exposure onset symptoms cases began rise again. far soon end lockdown. lockdown needed end new cases much much closer zero. Back March, believe, Trump Administrations laid good guidelines follow begin re-opening, however, nobody followed guidelines. went ahead decided long enough good reason.

Here's graph new cases per day US: gonna go trouble lockdown, even half-assed one, makes sense end US did. Look South Korea Italy things, cases started spiking little US look countries now. Yesterday Italy found 169 new cases. South Korea found 62. United States? 65,488. US 5 times population Italy finding nearly 400 times many new cases disease similar rates testing populations.

So yes, lockdown United States expected results. one would realistically expect half-assed lockdown ended soon get rid virus. That's I'm advocating here. I'm advocating much stricter lockdown lasts new cases pretty much gone. Like I'm talking end maybe dozen new cases per day proper contact tracing ready deployed outbreaks flare again. Use time lockdown develop deploy contact tracing 2. Practically that’s going work. can’t keep people US ordinary circumstances.

You're correct hypothetical scenario play perfectly. addition lockdown still degree interaction people. Even brick-and-mortar stores closed, food supply chain still run. People slip cracks outbreaks inevitably pop again. That's important contact tracing place catch contain future outbreaks.

That's much, think? That's solution that's worse problem? Well, fact nothing do, return normal suffer it.

As outlined, certainly *is* something US could do. Hell, likely could already done correctly first time.

But I've got grim news you: suggestion really work well think does. US economy good shape. Directly indirectly, state disease that's spreading around. try return normal economy going suddenly roar back life. People taking trips would've taken virus gone. People hoarding money case find work. Businesses hesitant invest people things uncertainty looking future. Money stops moving much that's throws wrench gears economy. Opening everything back ""suffering it"" make money move. puts people risk, spreads disease more, delays point time virus gone economy come back life.

In order fix economy, must deal virus. Opening everything attempt force back normal get rid root cause problem. Oxford's Obvious choice would take precautionary measures (packing food) try avoid desperate extremes. keep path would like turning food already starting run low. worked restaurant years, one spits food.

Still contemplating running away aruba convince get plane can't. how? virus disappears high risk get pretend need take precautions anymore? Cubans vote Republican.

Mark Cuban said himself, company’s act lockdown going define brands decade. Tesla really really hurt brand what, extra week production? would think big famous things parked outside hospitals around New York loaded corpses, would curious citizens taking photos videos balconies nearby workplaces.

That's NY necessary locked hard point. People about. Manhattan ghostown. Wearing mask magic silver bullet. U need strict lock stop spread first all. Mask prevention slowing spread. Look countries did- strict lock down. First phase didn’t even actually complete ... CDC think don’t know recommending.. professional giving medically right view rather politically wrong one! people need stop allowing government that. blindly accept situation even try fight it. Putting hands face eating could get virus transferred mucus membranes mouth. less likely person person contact always wash hands eating problem kids transmit virus lots kids together social distancing developmental limits, spread virus affecting lot people getting many kids school Exactly, trolling, misrepresenting AAP statement Trojan horse radical agenda lockdowns really deserve much response. We've seen developed world get control virus without killing hundreds thousands people. Whining short term socioeconomic effects temporary lockdowns, heavily mitigated government subsidies, going change presenting obviously false dichotomy persuasive. dont know US guys USA, everywhere I've past 4 weeks required masks, nearly everybody wears Would gladly take Camacho Trump. He’s wrong. fair, government allowing come look property self isolate 14 days, come make put everyone town. idea *both* maintain property safe, seems fair me. People shitting people want check cottages clearly never owned home. forget Georgia ban Mask even surprised Kemp that..... want teach kids want safely time... think complicated that. Lockdown also required respect social distancing all. Masks one step towards controlling virus, still spread masks. think uninformed people would **more** willing break rules believed mask sufficient.

The sheer number cases right means drastic measures need taken. “Similar processes, hinging virus depositing fats, seem take place parts body too, liver, said Nahmias.” wear nose\*\*

I went groceries yesterday, 99% people wear masks (and saw 1-2 people without masks outdoor far away people), good 10-15% wear nose.

The local homeless folks, including ones severe mental illness...are wearing masks fine (I pleasantly surprised, honestly). random people inside CVS grocery stores don't. Ugh. national outrage made billions N95's point. Link available country, first comment says ""Fart"". love internet. take another form transportation then. Sometimes need inconvenienced take stand protect health.. case, both! likely early testing issues. Cases ramped positive rate around 40%. people tested people really really sick. Also, quote governor Texas. fake mask exemption cards, that's something toddler would see cartoon 

and say dumb would get grounded. part one understands since barely contact homeless 90% severely mentally ill. goes hand hand severe mental illness? Heavy drug use. America store severely mentally ill? Prison jails. Keep mind pulling shit ass like know talking about. Aren’t case counts rising even states mask requirements largely followed? Actually evolutionary traits caused first place because, according nature, decisive strongly focused/driven something that's wrong gives better chance survival/power less decisive cautious. sounds nice, oh well. die refused listen.... oh well. What's exactly control? high risk infection able ignore virus now? still take precautions would virus control? okay, fans loud enough able hear us stadium South Philly, thought might try force universities re-open Administration could add list achievements run election. probably thought low-hanging fruit given dependency foreign student fees. guess expecting legal challenge case blame ICE trying enforce it. survive re-election? til 2022 I've seen approval stayed pretty high ordeal.

Could imagine media outrage direct order Republican Govenor turned covid positive elderly away hospitals forced back nursing homes healthy elderly? CNN would calling Governor's head. “The best safest way reopen schools context low community transmission effectively suppressed broad-based comprehensive strategy""

Well guess effectively rules half US. ""Look guys, killed like 150k people. That's basically nothing"". government actually fully committed slowing transmission virus significantly like countries done, could safely open schools. today Valve masks protect protect others you. they're discouraged. (Technically everybody wore valve mask they'd protected aerosols droplets could still infect others surface contact). ""fix"" taping valve, recommend makes much harder breathe. Another fix put surgical mask top actually increases effectiveness protects others. You’d bet 1700’s medicine modern day vaccine going extensive safety trials...?

Isn't Australian government locking neighborhood apartment building covid test positive patients allowing people go without police supervision?

This vastly different what's happening U.S. What's 2 x 130? feel like remember reading artifact American policy WWII. wage freezes companies opted offer healthcare benefits way attract workers. (clearly designed temporary emergency) policy USA became frozen place next 80 years, thanks lobbying aka bribery politicians US, shows broken United States policymaking reform system become. One American mates USA pointed US system ""checks balances"" much checking absolute power (most modern countries form), rather protecting slavery interests, making hard people stand elites. Unfortunately US remains stuck this. PA? actually good time people living East Coast stock supplies like gloves, toilet paper, canned goods, case covid come back winter months. would national guard prevented spread disease.  going hand masks wipe surfaces? point reinforced fact idiots use talking point mask protect virus reason wear them. would try refute anything said first answer question? absolutely told everything wanted know. 
But boy good thing Atlantic big Ocean. live city people dirt poor one starving.. get facts straight without bashing countries. aren’t selling super cars pennies many people would one. research posting don’t sound ignorant.

Edit: people can’t afford food usually taken care charities (free accommodation, food, clothing masks) go back home countries. thought talking shorter days weekends breaks. country 3 one week breaks, 2 two week breaks 1 six week break well extra days long weekends I'm fairly sure see case fatality rate stay lower beginning. testing less serious cases, younger population testing positive, better care infected, whether drugs work knowing ventilate apparently even putting patients  backs. Lower death rate damned good thing.

I hear wanting know lasting effects. Death rate obviously looked at, know that's really cared , point probably new know. got something think Norovirus years ago, sickest I've ever been. year felt like got colds infections way normal. point I'd say think long lasting effects, decade so. months Covid data look at. wont k ow what. any, lasting effects quite time. must good barbecue number theories...that kids usually talk, sneeze, cough much lower (in height) adults, less likely spread...some say kids likely asymptomatic...etc. think anyone knows sure. says lot country Abbott embarrassing.

TLDR. Someone covid infect others. numbers reported click bait, Chiara Giordano, reporter famous creating stupid articles click bait misinformation public. Make sure tell Chiara great job done. @cfgiordano Seems harsh okay think undisciplined pussies. Like really dude/dudette, wear mask practice wearing mask. Sure uncomfortable, condoms helmets. Grow realize mask you. We've got wear help problem, guy. explanation literally - figuratively - mentally deficient. 

It's common mistake people assume politicians stupid *they* think right. fact matter that, overwhelming majority cases, leaders simply pandering whatever direct support base is. Telling nicely rudely make much difference. seeing first hand US.  think real possibility death toll US reach 1 million end year unless something done.  combination full flu season virus potentially catastrophic.  flu compromise immunity many people leading yet covid19 infections. mom known sign voicemails “Love, Mom.” kinda think it’s great. would private school different?

The USA Wuhan style lockdown anywhere.  Since case, half-measures totally pointless.  I’m limiting large public gatherings, requiring masks encouraging good hygiene.

What skeptical vaccine going solve problem. two ways: natural herd immunity virus mutation less lethal. ways, let know.

I look articles. Thanks. really appreciate think time made legal flog anti maskers bio terrorism Fight it. won’t let cancel take BBB. know sounds dramatic, gyms shouldn’t allowed this. dont see old social ways dying, outdoor activities actually going increase people discouraged indoor activities. People try create new ways socializing outside. Actually, lot states require masks, good 30-40% customers don’t wear one. Businesses don’t enforce threat lawsuits. big ones like Walmart, target, Kohl’s, tjmaxx, etc. “recommend” masks won’t kick wearing one, even strict mask states started months ago like Pennsylvania  [Baader-Meinhof noticing northerners looking them. News primed watch New Yorkers carrying disease.

Actual statistics show level travel country bottomed unprecedented minimums. state worn mask public in. However, order enter store buy weed. spent rest time mountains isolating. feel incredulity people taking virus seriously. I'm red/purple state well working home since beginning virus. people allowed office tiny handful people maintain servers, even work staggered shifts wear masks ever need make contact other. rest us slated start easing back return office beginning next month masks staggered schedules, suspect they're going push back reopening considering recent outbreak.

But case last max 74 days going back normal, generation cycle sperms. mention, students aren’t going get full experience even education same. You’re gonna keep away people, probably rules socializing. would definitely take gap year understand print money billionaires government officials need bomb someone? can't wasting trivialities like food, roads, Healthcare Uphill ways I’m sure Love Govenor, he's definitely getting reelected! messed around mask thing made huge difference us compared states. first wave even finished tho probably knows public education much know life remote African village Shut down. Close shop. Forget balance sheets.   👍 wasn’t calling ignorant unless made decision. understand point, however seems like especially bad idea stick back nursing home.... hard lessons learned guess. *It's way sure.* last point, really true. true states keep track peoples movements right now, tell could pressed to. Goverment's ready access anonymized cell phone data purposes (I access it), could easy finding behind data, happen? Probably yeah we're fucked. wonder US done first wave then. Reopening bars indoor dining fucking stupid begin with. Except endangering everyone else no, work. 

What kind scum tries belittle women's rights willingly infecting people potentially deadly disease?

Fucking pathetic. WTF, old you?! I'm 23 &amp; remember anyone teased weight either way! 

Honestly, think need scare kids straight health/PE/nutrition instruction now. Please!

If re-open schools taking many reasonable precautions necessary, inevitably still increase transmissions, number infected, allow disease cause harm. Everyone subreddit put conscious effort stay informed damage disease capable causing well aware harm.

If re-open schools instead remote learning (or learning kids access remote learning), inevitably cause significant harm many, many kids. average person, parent, member subreddit uninformed damage.

The way make right decision measure two harms choose lesser evil. observation simply sub place discussion little information latter. Everyone healthy respect damage covid-19 virtually everyone ability imagine understand damage done canceled remote schooling. good place read issue re-opening pay teachers much doctors than? more. provide needed equipment much expect give?

Doctors people part healthcare effort. Janitors, cafeteria workers, receptionists, nurses, administrators. doctors make good salary: immense amount labor fight disease put residents fellows receive modest salaries. Regardless, compensation determined lot factors ""are willing work pandemic?"" can't imagine many relevant factors throwing away conclude that, end, teachers receive compensation physicians physicians expect teachers teach physicians' kids. can't imagine point even trying make.

Certainly providing schools protective equipment would part plan. Read AAP's guidelines re-opening schools.

As much give, tuition school asks for. public schools, need raise money public it. think education extremely important worth cost, whether children attend public schools kid teacher die tell family? easy explain death needed. mean ""what best kids.""

Should easy explain? think complicated issue. shame trying hardest find best answer best carrying out, even though whatever path chose going victims. point: complicated issue need figure unfortunately many already ""chosen side"" reasons trying greatest good minimize harm.

The experts see importance trying hardest return in-person learning hordes people influencing school districts stay closed without attempting fully understand downsides. conditioned think way repeatedly shout greedy people wanted re-open disregard safety precautions pure selfishness. different. yet think Trump pro re-opening part plan reelection act like everything normal. though. real case harm children greater harm additional infected. antimaskers childish ones

Hard tell though 7 day average rising. next days really tell whether trend deaths rising short bump. What's difference patio brewpub / brewery outdoor dining restaurant?

In health care, laughable idea there's free market. I've never gotten choose insurance have. Even could, asthma, would choose insure me, charge higher premium doubt could afford. even forced leave doctor liked got new job (and therefore new insurance). Trump never that. Even people wont listen. mandated state employees stores starting wear masks. antimask bullshit spreading. They’re idiots. Even idiot point would feel shame understand change needing happen.
This pure selfishness.

They can’t feign ignorance idiot here.

People dying, CHOOSING stop. Miamian here. Shit fucked. I’ve basically indoors four months since shit went downhill NY. Groceries delivered door take adventures. want nothing go back normal able stupid things took granted. Guess it’ll another year rate venture golf course Ross :(. could see thousands people perspective ground. must pretty darn tall. finding ""recovered"" patients cardiovascular/lung damage. Even asymptomatic people. virus well could taking decades lifespans. 

It plain stupid intentionally infect people disease know almost nothing about. Even managed prevent people dying, virus still damaging lot people's bodies permanently. Yep. Weekend reporting. Check back tomorrow Orange County's Karens reason could see anyone voting choice Hillary pretty damn corrupt. trump even (and obviously) so, really there's good reason.  don’t think handle another six months year two years this. genuinely don’t .

I fucking hate her. Abbott's heart dead legs--cold unfeeling.

Part thinks reason he's piece human garbage tree knocked legs, also rendered peepee useless. kicked people park taking mask, would good. far I've seen, enforcement ""you can't get photo take ride"". Which, christ's sake, practically nothing. ride operators check photos identify non-mask-wearers security kick out. I'm Montana. schools close too. We're averaging 80-90 cases per day (I know sound like much, Montana lot) lot clustered three counties, one teach in. headline saw today students parents town ""may"" wear masks. Schools going take necessary precautions I'm thinking seriously resigning it. Yes we're lower risk, that, one taking precautions need stay low risk. pls DeSantorum could something short market? totally original thought /u/undeleteparent Yea totally agree - prefer 7 day averages exact words looking for! gave us minivan make matters worse (all had, booked). 
Big ole LOOK wagon. can’t tell you’re deliberately obstinate you’re moron. 

The evidence cited comes real world. It’s lab experiments. data real world evidence including variables. There’s nothing “get”. 

You say cloth masks offer protection absolutely zero evidence back up. However provided evidence contrary also disprove point. Unless plan trying discredit University Oxford too?

You say masks worked California wouldn’t shutting shows masks aren’t effective - completely moronic statement make. Firstly, there’s large number anti-maskers (like you) don’t follow advice. Secondly, absolutely nobody claimed 100% effective eliminating transmission. reduce risk, don’t eliminate it. subreddit might well mask cult people look evidence make form sensible viewpoint issue - unlike people. 

The article I’ve linked also evidence masks reducing influenza transmission that’s we’re talking about, they’re different viruses. 

Fauci trying protect mask supplies healthcare workers greater need. He’s [admitted himself. think public health expert 20 years service US government, expert opinion little valid yours. 

You’ve quoted small piece text 11 year old article influenza. evidence you’ve got build argument on? Firstly, that’s different virus different transmission behaviours. Secondly, evidence advice evolves science progresses date evidence already presented clearly shows wrong. 

Don’t flatter president. Lancet published data HCQ trialled around world important information disseminate. authors couldn’t certain data retracted. Lancet’s fault acted appropriately. think I’m going continue listen scientific evidence presented respectable sources rather listening moronic anti-maskers reddit. thanks effort anyway.  Welcome real world lol Lmao poor r/coronavirus! Can’t doom gloom y’all want huh? *good news compute* 🤯 doesnt mean makes much money, day trading solely based performance know people go find actual job wasn’t bringing enough, it’s tough profession “violence never answer”. 

Except 1776. maybe 1860. 1942. we're cool fam. C'mon now. know they're they're research. know people behavior relative taking precautions been, might better idea risky is. city small, county lot cases. around Houston, risks going pretty high. beatings continue morale improves. Even Fauci president right we'd almost situation people like guy would resort violence across country met necessary orders. Kinda reminds rooftop parties Independence Day (the movie). Everyone welcoming aliens earth, open blow whole skyscraper away. DeVos proves idiot is, interview. really need someone make face swap image DeSantis Farquaad quote it. USA, large percentage population following basic guidelines. There's little way positive government enforcement even encouragement. Schools relaxing rules school ""it's convenient make changes""... willing spend dime make proper changes. Keep spamming eventually believe 2nd grader didn’t learn anything didn’t already know shutdown. going pointless year virtual learning. sub joke. Jesus Christ. people entitled CA prepares this

Jerry Brown saw mess CA post-2008. cut spending. raised taxes. created roots rainy day fund.

And now? CA *rough* shape nowhere near catastrophe would without spending cut tax hike. It'll rough couple years state foresight bounce back better most. Guys. Stop reporting facts. You’re bumming out. guy, school isn’t government funded daycare send kids get hands 8 hours meal. I’m really sorry can’t work home pandemic need childcare less important human lives.  Weird fact live part Detroit north Canada. arrived one. empty colony. FLORIDA carved tree... Well thing came rushing in, ever doubt  politicians actually going there, video. know risks course going there. low info base, hand. Wait telling guy stole election good job? Huh worth looking difference H1N1 (Swine) flu COVID-19 United States:

H1N1: **12,469** 12 months

COVID-19: **135,561** 4 months.

That's 10x number deaths 1/3 remember first started arguing friends Facebook compared flu. One unhealthy friend posted H1N1 big deal, we're blowing way proportion.

H1N1 could've lot worse US, COVID-19 bad US. rest world basis. Something changed 2009/2010 2020 US. figure things went wrong time, maybe could take action sometime end year (I'm thinking maybe early November?) mitigate damage. What's difference patio brewpub / brewery outdoor dining restaurant? well think dude. 
The name “Palestine” mispronunciation “land philistines”, ancient people living Israel alongside ancient Israelites. 
Moreover, name given country spite Jews earlier times, like Romans naming Jerusalem “Aelia Capitolina”, capitol. 
The old ids handed Jews others living country. 
Palestinians today immigrants Egypt, Syria Jordan. even reflects names surnames, names cities countries indicates come there. 
The Zionist movement basically return Jews home, since occupied since occupied philistines, king David, 3000 years ago (thus also deep ownership land since earlier modern country).. first reported local NYC news magazine, certainly seems lean left. really killin office. overruled local Democratic lawmakers wanted issue mandatory mask orders earlier... Yes, beginning flairs country, see posts

If only. 100% agree. though lot Republicans would catch realize ""oh actually flu"".

Lol delete dude Upticks maybe, new case numbers remaining double digits low hundreds, real testing, contact tracing limited shutdowns specific areas. spots fires appear manageable. situation US uncontrolled Mega-Inferno spread across wide swaths country. Viruses mutate become lethal, mutate become less lethal. Otherwise virus kills host spread virus dies host. That's mutations lethal die out, mutations infectious less lethal spread around become endemic. likely we'll see virus years come. Good job Lol. Bet dismissed that, though. chance faces prison time let’s real lol won’t even conversation think found like 1% people tested actually failed drug test, winding actually costing state money.

Port towns, international airports population centers going susceptible, obviously. Globalization + pandemic care politics. 

But, can’t deny areas outbreak may sometimes ‘blue’, well, universities multiculturalism know, outside influences...

Sweden still 5% economic contraction year, example. 

Also, shutdowns alone cause massive economic downturn. reaches point people simply risk lives certain actions. Yes; agreed sentiment multiple times now. known actions would interpreted way. cost self-insurance outrageous. Yet, frequently mentioned easily accessable.

Thank you. wish concrete info. run across some, hopefully remember share. Wuhan similar climate DC. yeah, mild winters really humid summers. Masks mandated many U.S. states lack consequence business refuse service even enforced limited sense. 

We definitely need federal leadership issue *just* got fucking idiot president wear one *fucking hospital* quickly followed talking point “supporting masks settings”. It’s infuriating.  whoever refuses wear face mask automatically elects coronavirus experiments vaccine trials? 51k*

Even 51k likely higher real number confirmed Covid expert legit infectious diseases scientist involved directly process developing vaccines, mostly conjecture part.

The fact really know when/if vaccine arrive consequences interim. Let's hope Oxford Pfizer projects prove safe effective sooner rather later. it’s unAmerican criticize USA, mean it’s fascist?

When mess up, deserve criticism. one become better can’t learn mistakes, even acknowledge them? 

You want worship country, go ahead. ones gonna stop you. rest us don’t view USA God. It’s system full people, people mess up. Sometimes, like right now, mess really bad. Calling like is, demanding charge held accountable, patriotic. refuse allow blinded support “team”, take USA selfishness pride. Ignoring problems like these, ruined whole nations. don’t want USA destroyed. want stand take responsibility it’s problems, fix them. That’s build enduring nation. burring head sand throwing tantrum. Maybe exact true number must low. people resumed daily activities since one two months ago. difference almost every one wears mask. Since obviously outbreak cities, hard hide, infection level must low. Domestic travelling trafic congestion start indicators people think Covid-19 big issue lives now. don’t count anything you’re resident goes snowbirds. 

They also don’t report deaths underlying conditions. Example: chronic pneumonia, get year due fishing younger days. last month sucks balls, hasn’t won’t ever kill me, got Covid died due condition would say wasn’t Covid death.

Sorry bad wording / stoned Django unchained? question foreigner: American traveler check state-specific requirements? mean, people drive covid state, stay relatives friends, like there's professional point they'd better provide contact info so-and-so. site people use check sort information fall ""you know this"" rule? There’s also absolutely zero consensus strong and/or long lasting Covid immunity recovery. Currently, anyone says know sure either way bullshitting probably themselves. latter, even though overall density low, many people still live cities. exactly would NY enforce this? human life worth price restaurant remaining open. Restaurant staff risk lives protect someones investment. sucks people area racist, nothing restaurants shutting prevent loss human life. Like said above, vast majority places would failed anyway. people want come back business simply declare bankruptcy, rebuild would likely part 80% failure rate already exists. ones worked odds get set open first place, absolute banana. mean need say werent primary contributors. must die rich stay rich! must sacrifice lives money! duty!

Fuck me. doomed. make simple meals? every meal take 6 hours make? wish badly cared. furthermore wish anyone cared. simply don't. need safe, wear mask, avoid large gatherings etc. chances dying/getting extremely sick making baby sick worth driving insane over. Mental health matters. extremely anxious nature, understand. Take precautions can, reaction little extreme likely cause issues actual virus. safe take virus seriously, unless comorbidities overreacting. 

Passing people older adults issue, think babies pretty safe. odds infants dying disease extremely low. Unless baby immunocompromised wouldn’t worry much honestly. put everything context. closed schools implemented lockdown, even virus infected 1%.

In state Wisconsin, locked 19 confirmed cases, number grown 35,000.

We taken drastic measures, concerts, sporting events, schools etc... virus infected 1% us, number tested positive, true number closer 16.5 million 5% infected.

If open fully mitigation, virus kill 1 million Americans, died wars fought history. 

As become evident AZ, FL, TX, opening give virus chance spread exponentially cause deaths way permanent damage living. 

We taken extraordinary steps curb virus hasn’t enough. That's relatively inexpensive tuition, fyi 👏 👏 EVEN 👏 👏 OPEN 👏 Doctor 💀 hate agree you.... agree you.

And no, dont need read article written Hasbara. go genetic studies shows. 

If 95% Palestinians came somewhere else 99% Jews came somewhere else. 🤷🏻‍♀️ reasoning issuing mandate wearing masks going suddenly start government says so. also pointed state lacks resources enforce order. 

You explained white supremacist, ""doing less minimum"" spending ""time money effort oppressing citizens"". I'd that. first read Oregon *shocked*.
Seeing it’s Orange County I’m surprised. Hey now, San Diego here. Despite surrounded dipshit counties sharing border Mexico we’re holding own. 

In fact (ok I’m pretty sure said one press briefings within last 2 weeks) half hospitalizations Imperial. 

I don’t blame Imperial like OC Riverside. going Imperial terrible cases flooding Mexicali Imperial county itself. Yeah estimates data properly compiled. particular flu season also estimated Final death total bit half corona virus confirmed right now. year pandemic ended start compare two numbers moment it’s disingenuous... 

And doctors saying flu challenged health system... virus same.... immunity flu shots it’s spreading freely. Really it? Last saw, granted provably April, okay.

Guess people traveled spread it. think ND much tourism too. news/rumors? No, Patrick want wear mask, don't. leave someone asks wear mask establishment.

Not wearing mask violation governor's orders. dick, violating law. Oh yes, ultimately way. doubt order mentioned anything like that. still huge food order. 

Also sore absurdity fact birthday declared illegal mind blowing. Free society ass.

My ultimate life goal contribute society good, enjoyable, fulfilling comfortable life. society somehow benefits that, good. not, well, whatever. Typical example, work earn money myself, pay taxes. 5-6 weeks ago accurate time frame. serious spikes cases started mid-June, around 4 weeks ago. daily deaths starting ticking last week, lagging 3 weeks behind cases. Yeah. That’s fun expression isn’t it? Except haven’t used slogan 10 years. Also, really doesn’t apply it. whole problem Covid likes move about. like month. posts reminiscent people laughing double digit case numbers shortly following lockdowns. look us. virus slow burner till you’re completely fucked Oh yes, mom’s body currently slowly disintegrating autoimmune disorders. siblings positive RA. don’t know family Celiac, yeah, looks like look more. 

It’s felt like years like kind executive function problem; like wire brain cut getting intention action way harder people. don’t know that’s relevant, I’ve started think, whatever is, serious not, physical psychological, it’s “just me,” either normal failing life whatever. 100F North Texas we're hitting 10k cases day. Really along southern border huge outbreaks. Cases actually gone heat (but necessarily heat). worse nothing. every comment become chain reddit? notably, WA TX tax corporate gross receipts (as opposed income). fine lol health, agree, probably great idea. woman, lived 100 years old, decided risk worth go see dying son, anyone judge give advice?

She’s definitely right. America really interesting country. find two countries here.

Soo. sure works anymore.  shut down. Ohana means stay fuck away tourists Orlando, FL urgent care LPN here. can't describe much seething anger when:


- patient says went large party bunch people party said tested positive

- patient vacation different state

- call positive cases inform results ask quarantining like told to, answer ""*kinda*""

- patient asks ""personal opinion"" believed number cases reported every day true wearing face mask actually important 

- patient getting seen virus tries convince virus hoax patient next door tested positive 

- Patients complain things constantly changing (something even manager's manager control over) wait long even though reservation (we're disinfecting room equipment use every single patient)

- receiving end patient's belligerent tirade something happened working

- Patients physically come clinic ask results everyone learn s/he's fucking positive call us every fucking day asking results

- Patients come tested travel go vacation

- immunocompromised patient comes retested properly observing full 14-day quarantine taking extreme precautions... tell still positive must quarantine two weeks

- Patients say, ""I know *your* fault, (*insert litany complaints here*)"" 

- patient demands rapid testing xyz even though reached capacity rapid testing day 

- Patients get wait time quotes 2 3+ hours, register anyway, lash us long wait car bring in. think kidding said 3+ hours? 


We understand anxiety. understand people need cleared go back work. understand getting tired quarantining. 

*However...*

We much 12hr shift number staff have. expected call every single patient results get we're seeing literally dozens people shift extra documentation every single person comes tested. phone never stops ringing. getting yelled several times every single day patients take frustration us. 

We exposed several confirmed cases every single day. also high-risk family members expose come home every single day. happen asthma. get tested, quarantine wait notified like everyone else. we're negative, time spent quarantine comes PTO.

Herd immunity doesn’t mean virus irradicated able grow exponentially, still ongoing infections. PANHANDLE BEHAVIOR DeVos sucks, never gave number percent. Dr. Birx said less 0.1%. COVID-19 pandemic caused SARS-CoV-2 virus continues severely impact health and
economies around world. However, underlying mechanisms behind disease still under
investigation. particular interest scientific community reason children typically
experience much less severe symptoms infected COVID-19. mild clinical course the
pediatric population suggests age-related factors affecting host susceptibility may hold key to
better understanding disease. Based extensive review literature SARS-CoV-2, as
well diversity immune system function age, hypothesize thymus may play
a significant role explaining phenomenon. Namely, propose hypothesis thymic
output therefore lack diversity T-cell receptor (TCR) affinity causally linked SARS-
CoV-2 susceptibility. Statistical analysis epidemiological data Canadian COVID-19 infections
is provided support theory. Furthermore, lymphopenia (an abnormally low level of
lymphocytes blood) observed severe clinical cases SARS-COV-2 explained a
delay activation adaptive immune system, due part rarity SARS-CoV-2 specific
clonotypes maintained lymph nodes blood. Non-specific (with respect TCR)
chemokine signaling absence clonal expansion T-cells would present lymphopenia
in respiratory infection. also note existing agents, thymosine-α-1-Fc

undergone V-D-J-recombination. therefore suggest TA-1 therapeutic effect in
COVID-19 patients via stimulating production additional diversity T-cell receptor affinity,
and facilitating production T-cell clonotypes specific SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, well as
priming dendritic cells increasing expression co-stimulatory molecules. Furthermore, the

The average American see issues exist, want anything change them. mean almost 350 million people, someone probably thinks place utopia, mentioned average American acknowledge, talk about, care change issues. say average American think country issues. Acknowledgement awareness two different things. aware gravity, acknowledge presence everything do. 

I explain American culture is. aware multiple cultures exist United States; exclude majorly American culture shapes majorly American society see today. Ask anyone either lived visited United States general culture hear overlapping themes.

I never said U.S. changing. responding comment said,

""I get everything feels alarming loud antagonistic controversial that’s change looks like."" 
These feelings new awakened COVID. Many communities United States felt way decades seen little positive growth movements communities. many movements, biggest transformation look systems systems themselves. apply many facets United States law enforcement system healthcare system education system. 

I understand view United States differently. likely different backgrounds lived different experiences, tell someone valid observation United States,
""You guys keep eye rising racist movements try influence rest Europe. US bad right global neighborhood isn’t exactly pristine either."" shows deflection. issues happening United States. exist within global neighborhood try distance us from.

But, exactly kind headline that, run major news outlet, breeding ground misinterpretations like, ""OMGOODNESS, means 33% young people get deathly ill virus!""

The UK must prepare potential second wave covid-19 winter risk seeing double number hospital deaths occurred first wave, Academy Medical Sciences warned.

In report1 said combination covid-19, backlog patients needing NHS assessment treatment, possibility flu epidemic posed “a serious risk” health UK.

The academy called “intense preparation” throughout rest July August reduce risk NHS overwhelmed save lives winter.

Central minimising transmission covid-19 community, increasing capacity national test, trace, isolate programme cope overlapping symptoms covid-19, flu, winter infections, said.

Health care staff facilities reorganised maintain covid-19 covid-19-free zones, must adequate personal protective equipment, testing, infection control measures minimise transmission hospitals care homes, said.

There also “concerted effort” make sure at-risk people health care workers get flu vaccinations, added.

Anne Johnson, member expert group project Academy Medical Sciences’ vice president (international), said, “We need minimise coronavirus flu transmission everywhere, especially hospitals care homes. done, must done now.”

The report acknowledges high degree uncertainty covid-19 epidemic evolve UK suggested “reasonable worst case scenario” prepare R value rising 1.7 September 2020 onwards.

Under scenario, would peak hospital admissions deaths January February 2021 similar worse first wave spring 2020, said.

This modelling estimates number covid-19-related hospital deaths (excluding care homes) September 2020 June 2021 could high 119 900 (95% confidence interval 24 500 251 000), double number occurred first wave spring 2020.

But report noted estimated figures take account government actions reduce transmission rate, recent results trial treat patients intensive care steroid dexamethasone,2 could substantially reduce mortality.

Stephen Holgate, respiratory specialist University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, chaired report, said, “This prediction, possibility. modelling suggests deaths could higher new wave covid-19 winter, risk happening could reduced take action immediately.

“With relatively low numbers covid-19 cases moment, critical window opportunity help us prepare worst winter throw us.”

The report produced following request government’s chief scientific advisor advisory group 37 experts.

Archive: Styrud chief physician Danderyds hospital chairman Stockholm Medical Association. admits care acted incorrectly [the case 57-year-old Håkan]( case, wrong. taken in. easy wise [wise hindsight]. health service panicked bit ended pandemic know fast would develop disease worked. typical example get well relatively small means initially restrictive providing care.


DN contacted Danderyds Hospital answers questions via email. Lena Hellström, chief physician Internal Medicine states patients severe dehydration given IV drip regardless underlying cause. 


“If patient relatively young laboratory values general conditions indicate severe dehydration, reasonable assume patient able drink sufficient amounts usual way. sent home emergency room request return case deterioration ”. 


Åsa Hammar, Chief Physician Patient Safety Manager, states follow deviation reporting every week. ""So far, taken part investigation covid patients denied care incorrectly."" 


Karin Malmqvist, chief physician, states three chief physicians quality-checked care 120 deceased covid patients March April 23 cared ICU without another ward.


“In preliminary report, see care worked well. Danderyd Hospital restrictive providing covid patients adequate care”.


Thomas Lindén, head unit National Board Health Welfare , states authority already early recommended everyone high fever week seek care. 


- get bad fever, need IV drip, also lose fluid diarrhea, risk greater. good could get help - even though unusual way get care. dehydrated get IV drips, often get well. think seek hospital care case deterioration, chose licensed health care staff make decisions interventions even outside care.

Lindén questions whether hospital, sent patient home emergency room, followed patient feeling afterwards.


#Both Anna Johan Styrud critical fact oxygen drips longer readily available covid patients nursing homes - even palliative care stage.


- dehydrated, get rid covid-19, always fluid. never dehydrate death - even going die. die thirst terrible, think. nauseous, thirsty, pain.


DN previously reported relatively elderly covid patients sent hospitals nursing homes, also according National Board Health Welfare's guidelines.

There age cutoff. Even really good data, magic number. could safe say high school less say graduation. teachers, parents, grandparents live grandchildren?

The experts say children likely spread disease. experts saying benefits school outweigh risks, I'm going follow that. Unfortunately many sub seem care expert advice suits them. sad. county probably going back lockdown week. Overburdened medical staff unable provide standard care. would say yes  Omg!

Bit rough. Totally unnecessary.

But went doctor swab gentle painful.

I proceed caution. don’t think rule reinfection. issue many people seem think rule immunity. Kind tame expected overview ways pandemic intersects affects generation gap. salient TL;DR start pandemic, older generation didn’t take seriously dynamic flipped young ignoring recommendations whereas older ones hew them. funny dont really know things virus you, exactly deadly is, actually started, airborne not, dangerous young people, transmitted surfaces ..

.. pretty sure BLM protests didnt spread it. shouldn’t June, FFS. Quick, single person's drama, let us post Reddit negative comment Sweden! off-topic? EU take one look say hell no. Canada Australia take one look say hell no. Trump force US buy vaccine, probably briefing ineffective dangerous Even wasn’t pandemic, school district holds back school pool party? sounds weird. long time , gaps arisen generation, Magnus Karlsson explains. happens depends two things. one hand, society changing time quickly new generation feels partly live different world previous generation. result, boundary different ages lost: knows best? tug-of-war arises authority decide.

In past, older generations completely dominant younger ones order establish society. new technology new fashion emerge throw away old truths rapidly, thus power shifted older younger, really know benefit older people life puzzle.

Empathy created genuinely interested other, performance society, first foremost important interested increased standard living 

This perspective one considering behavior young disrespectful elderly, thinks Magnus Karlsson.

The lack empathy may due kind alienation generations, says: today's society generally see people means achieve goals, make career, become popular, on.

- Empathy created one genuinely interested other, performance society, first foremost interested one's increased standard living exploiting people much later developing one's quality life deep significant relationships, says he.

● ● ●

With empathy, one could see elderly feel snubbed freedom waiting long professional life, one could understand envy young people greater opportunities move society. could understand frustration young people's arrogance arrogance means may spread infection.

And maybe also understand young people's actions, says psychologist Björn Hedensjö.

- absolutely understand that, without reason accepting negligence recommendations. understood partly young people work general - group level impulse-driven, take greater risks sometimes less thoughtful decision-making - partly considering that, example, canceled student celebration big thing young person human life. also loss, think need relativize. 

So get young people follow recommendations closely?

Elisabeth Wall Bennet Swedish Public Health Agency says work progress.

- making large information effort together National Board Health Welfare MSB. meetings several times week, raised issue strengthen communication. Facebook social media try target younger ones. intensify future, seen trends.

Two weeks conversation Wall Bennet, Monday July 6, read note Gotland's Allehanda. There, island marked ""influx party-hungry young people"", headline reads. ""More young people went island party, noticeable hotel bookings,"" written, Gotland Police reminds recommendations limit crowds keep distance. 

Which gets fastest spread, information infection, remains seen. Thankfully sanity mess. Yes, supposed send kids back school 4 weeks, hooray! course jail. put people jail smoking plant. Fucking assault dangerous weapon(saliva) way, way. WAY WAY WAY, worse that.

I'll never understand people weak fascists damn useful idiots. Would stand let stab you, too? there’s permanent immunity disease makes confident vaccine work better you’re immune system? 

Also immunity, isn’t would normally consider immunity probably collectively stop using word immunity. It’s equivalent thinking got cold flu winter you’re immune ever getting another one. Archive link: 

The young people party, socialize keep distances. elderly affected spread infection die. create generations? 

DN's Kristofer Ahlström takes closer look coronavirus given conflict young old new fuel.

It gloomy windy spring evening Medborgarplatsen Stockholm. Clumped dense clusters, students stand coveralls cold white caps heads. defied cold, wind strict recommendations authorities government stay home; 18- 19-year-olds take student year allowed celebrate it. celebrate it, called official language.

But do.

“Normally, would three parties already. party. understand celebrate student single day "", says one students Aftonbladet's reporter.

Two months later, week midsummer weekend, Public Health Agency holds press conference state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell addresses age group least inclined follow Public Health Authority's (FHM) recommendations keep distance, good hand hygiene work home.

""The group good youngest, perhaps surprising anyone,"" says Tegnell.

Elisabeth Wall Bennett, Head Communications FHM, agrees refers figures analysis research firm Novus, shows people 18–29 age group less compliant terms recommendations.

- part, think due purely existential, age feel death distant. think invulnerable. Since then, young affected extent, much communication older group affected, says.

It recurring mantra among young people: risk group. behave accordingly. effect beginning felt. world opened communities, second wave corona erupted. young people identified main cause.

It mainly seen USA: New York Times writes Arizona, people aged 20-44 account half new reported cases. Florida, average age corona infected 35 years - figure 65 years March. Texas, young people account majority new cases infection.

There clear signs conflict older younger people become topical corona crisis 

Svenska Dagbladet reports even though corona infection decreasing 23 country's 50 states, increasing many. United States' leading infection control expert Anthony Fauci claims younger people's indifference social distancing main reason: ""They pass infection older people hospital.""

In Germany, newspaper Die Zeit lists spread infection region region, Berlin - previously fairly spared - second highest country, likely effect opening clubs bars, obvious party city young people across Europe.

● ● ●

Life celebration, quote National Theater. perhaps another line rock group made relevant: ""Are afraid child, little mother?""

Because younger ones continue party spread infection, elderly suffer end intensive care, worst die off, generations' relationship do? seen betrayal, risk pandemic widen gap already exists old young?

Magnus Karlsson sociologist Lund University. believes pandemic given old discord new fuel.

- clear indications conflict elderly younger raised corona crisis, least manifested lack respect other, according reports mainly younger towards elderly.

The development society meant old role guide lives younger become weaker, says.

- society increasingly made free rites passage, adults responsible ceremonial, young people left invent themselves, anxiety entails increased mental illness among young people.



- Maybe that's struggle keep school graduation become important, soon last transition ritual adulthood remains.

The psychologist Björn Hedensjö believe conflict long run make big difference, since elderly always less frightened young people's behavior.

- corona crisis lasts long time, risk gap widens least temporarily simple reason older younger [see other] less.

● ● ●

Thus, conflict older generation, called ""boomers"", younger ones, often called generation Z ""zoomers"", ongoing. Internet, [a memo circulating][ embodies two sides' inability reach other: grandfather complains grandson tattoos ruin future. grandson counters grandfather stop using fossil fuels reason. elderly refuse.

But boomers long, even 70s generation, dress society's mistakes.

In part, based envy sense injustice: 40s-60s generations proportionally previous generation did, younger ones less ever. generations received benefits demand whole world take account, younger ones faced missed student parties summer jobs, recession risks making impossible start career get home. Yes, total collapse ecosystem top that, course.

The Boomer generation certainly first reject previous generations' traditional life patterns values - two world wars reasons question. social acceleration increased even faster, identified brake pad. Meat Mountain, sense tough lump blocks entrances labor market, another common desert name.

- fact large age group also great influence development society. social development many young people think gone wrong direction created unsustainable situation future generations, says Magnus Karlsson.

It easy forget, beginning pandemic elderly accused taking recommendations threats seriously, relatively easy society, want sacrifice quality life good public.

For example, Amelia Adamo testified storm hatred subjected declaring intended continue living usual despite belonging risk group: ""I never much hatred, told real Swede."" , told Express.

I, too, must admitted, went 40s-critical track. comment, wrote “In virus debate, 40s really appeared defiant teenagers refuse listen best health; instead staying indoors, rushed social life, booked cruises trips Thailand pubertal lack self-preservation. ”

Considering situation developed since then, sharply deaths increased, least elderly, several times considered unpublishing text DN's site. guess kind value time document.

Often whole wheat breads sugar honey beginning help bread rise, esp sandwich bread.

By comparison, [bread local 1 gram added sugar per slice, slice bit thinner machine. all, same.

Sugar also helps bread keep longer.

High sugar breads - toast sandwich slices - around 0.8-1g sugar / slice - already taste pretty sweet continental European thing bread europe tastes bit bland

Hm, think e.g. german sour-dough rye bread tastes bland? even pumpernickel? opposite, many breads (and thousand registered breads, traditional regional ones) pretty strong bread flavour taste nice crust, yeah, varieties sweet hint. mild taste, that's mostly wheat breads, often mild, indeed could call bland, particular baked yeast leavening without sour-dough.

The left unhinged, need help. them. them. 

My nephew five one frequent questions “Can bite this?” schools result closing again.

They won't. Like CA state shut indoor schools already implied jurisdiction schools. county keep schools open children left. Forgot that. 2020 fucked  Damn. Rock hard place. northeast US, option virtual learning. submit letters intent end last week, announce totals distance learners vs onsite students. took place yesterday, 70% choosing distance learning. Though, sure varies greatly based demographics socioeconomic status area teach. 

There time still, maybe logic science prevail. Florida racking serious numbers, better something... Often times, path progress paved lost jobs self-inflicted financial hardships.

I get it, I’m asking forfeit possessions, exact reason they’re going able open schools expose hundreds millions people risk - know people value retirement money lives. 

Humans protect what’s close (immediate family) hardly much else. USA USA USA! infected teachers general population also severe cases among teachers deaths. also question severity disease amount effectiveness antibodies made. looks like people severe disease (hospitalized) stronger response. People mild disease may good enough response immune long. 

A vaccine would allow everyone strong response covid without exposing live replicating virus. Move Chicago. kick-ass women Chicago. Texas going do? Fire all?

Why not? Reagan air traffic controllers. They'll probably use opportunity demonize public school teachers even would give politically friendly charter schools opportunity sweep like heroes. Next thing know commonplace history class hear something like ""George Washington declared independence Jesus' US"". public coughing following instructions stay home smallest symptoms. Don’t use masks excuse get around that.

And would situation people singing live? social distancing. Don’t use masks excuse get around that.

Masks complicates things put people situations wouldn’t put kept focus distancing. Ummm, no. 

What “actually” happened conspiracy sites posted undated videos, made claim without evidence, sub picked added “truth” virus. 

That’s actually happened. 

If want stop spreading misinformation, you’re going put effort understand became misinformed fix it. look numbers hard data objectively.

Your comment contains numbers hard data. Ironic. it’s almost like comment thread provides hard data sourced put together myself. Would shame looked it.

Naturally. minds houses pay places, ""no one going tell can't go damn house"". get go life always ""I live here"". Smallish sample size, but: aunt retired rather go back, friend becoming stay home dad rather go back, boyfriend quit go change careers getting masters instead. know many educators, least 10 going back, bet that’s happening everywhere. school systems going collapse. saying masks necessary? impress virus sure... daughter age, wore bucket head constantly said dalek.

Nevermind. Even communicated kind challenging way, best hope stay safe healthy. Seriously best country. think since current rules, placing responsibility infected person permissible. likely reason change it.

We're 11-person company, owner accountant already home quarantine tested positive. rest us tested yesterday, I'll amazed they're ones, especially considering work office we're constantly others' desks such.

I swear, can't ever begin understand warped 'reasoning' led people extremes irrationality pettiness. getting difficult see really shitty - dumb, ignorant, selfish... low quality people overall. 

Then again, Florida, I'm quite sure expected. Sad state affairs fucking county government step Feds incompetent trusted. covered plexiglass like bus drivers, teachers nothing. Sick kids come in, won’t wear masks there’s consequences following rules. need something. don’t see option point. Nothing else worked aside lockdowns Americans don’t follow anyway. People simply don’t listen. long safety trials complete efficacy shown (say 40%), expect available end year. Dicks ~~Harambe~~ groceries! Landlords leeches sheer quality landlord alone. I'm currently renting \~$850/month utilities included. AC goes out, calls day try get something scheduled AC fixed day, offers another place stay night. oven went out, replaced following Monday offered let us use oven another apartment. hires people cut yard, hires people take care issues there. Hell, started get roaches fault constantly putting washing dishes, told us needed get rid offered us spray keep kill them, actually come contact it. also forgot mention would normally $800/month, extra $50 we're currently month-by-month lease due us potentially moving areas near future. Yeah. run wood coffins... true I’ve cashed tens thousands miles. 12500 points one way typically. Pretty good

That said they’ve botched COVID response completely I'm sure human nature accurately perceive non-visible approaching danger. remember getting going UK Italians putting videos BEGGING us make mistakes did, yet...here are. damn thing started get bad. lived MA/NH well see similar lot ways. 

You guys advance warning lessons Italy well, come think it. start getting bad weeks UK. 

So South handled SPECTACULARLY badly, I'm absolutely convinced places would utilized advance warning better. places success almost entirely come quickly effectively got moving start ramping up, can't think many places really prepared advance. think aspect exactly regional thing much human thing. They’re much effective keeping particles out. guess eagles solitary intelligent animals certainly isn't, easily tell available excerpt. hospital always provides palliative care would definitely never administer morphine without doctor authorizes personally. Also think elderly respond badly icu treatment? certainly covid infected individuals respond badly ventilators (which small part intensive care, certainly mendatory) avoided whenever possible. course patient receiving enough oxigen means, hypoxia would make death certainty. Therefore extreme cases ventilator must used. retail need doctor better peopo go librul universities Important know bias trustworthiness: outlet political leaning, communicates rhetoric, facts highly reputable. 

This makes confident link BLM (2 cases) outbreak tower, however, official wording link, confirmation caused other, two even causally linked. 

Going Canadian American data protests anti-mask BLM, know Covid spread open air, significantly less able to, similarly significantly able spread indoors. entirely possible BLM protest cases jumped people building, protestor building caught disease, equally possible tiny number crowd cases point people infected elsewhere tertiary source also infected building. 

There's much unknown time definitive undermine current researched knowledge outdoor protests. said, people going protests still acknowledge potential spread virus, aware risks themselves, wear mask (and wash hands faces [with soap; kills virus]) return protest, recognize need vigorous self isolation. Even outdoor protest safer something like grocery store run indoors (with heavily circulated air refrigerated sections), still public situation carries (conflicting) degree risk Double taxes it'll pay wall. Double taxes it'll pay wall. Blows mind way customers use shield. never understand quote actually comes from. consequences kids teachers get sick. 

I mean elected, mean civil criminal. least involuntary manslaughter anyone dies. lot them. placing people danger. worries consequences. Even civil suit county pays. Make individuals liable see happens. bullshit. may also like [baboon](http://imgur.com/gallery/W1HPXTO) friend. Curious source claim? fake? Half million dead 1000s dying every day? Oh man ... dog saved me. thank much, I'll try shift today get people wear damn mask well testing tracing realistically can't open schools. worse closed hate people Boise Meridian follow guidelines wear masks, there's still large percentage still refuse wear one mUh FrEeDoMs. well June people stopped caring it. Cases spiking one bats eye. Cheaper. Better weather. actually home (if they're NYC). Asian Presbyterians Ohio. weird characterization numbers tend match NYS puts (NYC puts different numbers different times think muddys water bit?)

But NY breaks county, spreadsheet county daily cases, tests, positives, different rolling averages. Things care places dont easily show realize point people going stop dying it, right? small, local grocery store requires masks shop. Big signs multiple locations enter. Idiots still go without masks. paid 3 days announcement mean, investigate? Either wearing mask wasn't. mean back 2011? There's massive disconnect **at least** 5 years hard tell economy decent stock market fucking bonkers insane. easier see economy good stock market still bonkers. Wow that’s nice roommate heard anti-mask idiots referred ""maskholes."" like it, hope catches on. selfish maskholes ruining everyone else! Minnesotan, handle it, please let girlfriend seek refugee status country. Right? bizarre thing say. justification provided follow it.

It like Florida thinking covid19 would die reopening active cases first shut down. Oaklahoma days well. state tends happen weekends, leading believe results weekend hospital admissions and/or clearing backlog tests. numbers tests much lower 100-300 generally.

I would love hear explanation someone would know.  Yeah really directed you. know stupid right wing people. like, got another 49 states choose from. agree majority, move trying make new state. actually read these? nothing supports argument - fact many opposite. 

As said, **never** RTC shows face mask wearing general public *any* benefit reducing spread *any* virus - ***not one*** 

Do research instead file dumping stuff never even read. funneling money pockets rich! failure communicate terms morons understand. Every day footage hospital beds hallways. Every day pictures hundreds people waiting hours ER. visuals body bags used.

Why hell candy coated. shoved throats. long shovel pile bull shit dig graves tool need... hint: `/s` means ""sarcasm""... want pandemic continue?

Because pandemic continues. We'll see. live upstate NYC tons anti-mask coronahoax people. idea we're keeping numbers down, tbh. People south harder time understanding situation north completely different People worked home possible alot factories closed (Volvo Scania example). friends except 2 worked home, 2 didnt work hospital.  mean United States refers idea really fifty little countries one big one think people beat person normal members society? obviously problems long mask wearing. Yeah chances getting covid grocery store probably high flying. 10k good bet. Covid-19 discussed economics issue , Rights issue , partisan issue ...... lastly treated like public health issue ..... spitefully ! *Welcome Miami! Covididos Miami!* Really? four months still know we're wearing masks? They're stop droplets aerosols emit breathe, speak, sing, yell, etc. 100%, that's expect type ppe use it, already lost. 


C'mon man. gotta work little harder. goofballs watch Fox OANN hard time this. statement alone wouldn’t put run masks already unprepared shit President executive branch cabal threw original playbook. (Which also fucking had, Executive branch kneecapped everything place us look like South Korea banana republic.)

Remember government fucking implements. supposed implement DPA back February. fucking blame game bullshit. It’s fucking disingenuous lay blame Fauci’s feet respond every comment energy to. 

Mask guidance consistent since April. Ain’t excuses everyone else Fauci honest blunt hell since April. You’re harping stupidest point. Look republican local state officials blame.

Edit: add - confusion time. don’t think clear people time. 20/20 hindsight nice, right? 

But plan implementing worse. may actually gotten control full nationwide lockdown, even masks. remember March/April New York upwards around 700 deaths /day. guess time tell states reach high. use covid tracking, jhu, one others? Investigating? Isn’t photo proof? sure exactly needs investigating.. anywhere actually experiencing full hospitals? kind feel like past 2 weeks everybody saying ""just happen"". online class mean watching videos. professor talking would class, via zoom. participate discussions via zoom. professor assigns homework (which believe essential part learning) gives feedback work.
The professor available answer questions talk one one office hours (via zoom). fact, professor ""meet"" office hours pretty much time desire, ""meeting"" require physical presence.
I know amount effort varies greatly person person. case person classes well? Wisconsin kind slowpoke time warp. recent concerns addressed handled many states. Use case studies / white papers stop thinking you’re special. plus, people imaginary idea quality US healthcare best times. folks, aint good... mutation. Coronaviruses mutate much slower rate influenza. It’s impossible it’s unlikely. thanks, appreciate it. know mean understand, fullblown pandemic would cost 100.000 lives AZ flattening. Expect TX FL follow suit within 6 weeks. Herd immunity binary cases reach xx% disappear overnight. bowling, knocking 2 pins first roll much easier getting spare 7-10 split. hard understand. Plus true hot spots cause enough people modify behavior regardless regulations place.

Smaller Southern states gotten less attention (AL, SC, MS, TN) way though. Covid extract pound flesh every corner country regardless security theater place. I'd put money plateau \~75k new cases \~1000 new deaths around Labor Day. 

One thing guarantee doomers deniers point different data prove they're 100% correct. Nah, Mexico still clear winner conspiracy theory department.

The leading theory conspiracy send people hospital sedate doctors steal fluid knees sell black market. astounding. Roughly three week lag. I'm sure someone math based cases three weeks ago, imagine nightmarish tongue cheek Rightwing groups want best part think paying Portland Seattle. think leave money basically Rural versus Urban divide everywhere amplified. Yeah won’t fly anytime soon mainstay years DFW. Southwest one I’ll fly right actually care pandemic know mean good. need see evidence happens Republicans allowed plans. Sorry death Texas. Hopefully turn beautiful shade blue. One beating reported dubious source... harassment get even countries DK, people arseholes sack shit Fuck, point taxes use money build it.  honestly probably mind. stated article confirmed never wore mask whole flight. also picture boarding plane without mask either. death rate problem. infection rate rate complications.

If COVID-19 infected many people annual flu either killed spared infected, big deal - plenty diseases even today higher lethality (ebola, example). way infectious, vaccine lingering resistance previous similar strains, cripples survivors. *That's* makes scary. average person, aka super-rich, living Western Europe always better living US. Education send life long debt, healthcare bankrupt you, generally fewer idiots (though still lot) US. last ice age, North America covered ice kilometres thick. ice receded, lot north left what’s called irregular drainage pattern - lots little lakes, ponds, meandering streams don’t necessarily drain anywhere. Add continental climate hot summers free moderating effect ocean, places like Manitoba Minnesota perfect breeding grounds mosquitos. extended links data:

Week 27 28 samples taken found here: weeks found here: reported cases available official reports : link current excel sheet here: nice visualization trend time available Twitter account: numbers week 28: 81 801 PCR tests performed 2803 positive confirmed cases. making benefits industry. uk government calling ppl make European governments it? uk month behind it’s one reasons overtaken places like Spain deaths per million. 

It’s joke feel sorry british friends suffer due it.  Oh sure. rent freezes run millions Americans evicted streets, people know blame. Bars even best place consume alcohol since get 6 price one drinking home. Waiting haters chime Call crazy describe teaching conservative states *Stable* last word id use describe Shutdowns work. Masks do. Wear masks. Tbf, books retail store pretty simple. assume jobs actual accountants complex. kind fell jobs, kinda weird. Okay thanks response! Hopefully teachers unite one safety everyone. bet someone r/Masks4All done it. ""masks work"" point way back based already available data. need research it. like need research question whether climate warming due human activity: settled science point. ""twitter unreliable source"" rule changed past months? Genuinely asking pay attention recent rule changes Lots people thought. didn’t realize much work pet they’re returned. It’s sad. NYS really nice ya 1 state 50. FL share numbers think API'able (maybe now?) Huh, right that's something didnt know all. Turns rumours surgery next day something mixed another doctor different doesnt change treatment unacceptable best, still practicing still patients needed see, even week. Absolutely. Yea. heard that. 

If he’s actually charge covid task force, Trump would downsize oblivion... check work, get temperatures measured. wear masks everywhere besides desks. sit least 2m apart. disinfectant every desk stations everywhere hallways. Plus bathrooms obviously. offices filled 1/3 capacity TOPs.

We also currently 13 active cases greater metropolitan area.

Long story short: guys fucking fucked.  see promotion original comment. one made US. proving day absolutely idea talking about. asymptomatic. HR anything could held liable someone getting sick result actually enforcing policy change. HR's job protect business, employee. us Vermonters able keep numbers low AF even though close NYC, MTL, Boston. stricter rules New Jersey did. agree scabs come across border??? C'mon now... always been. trading hub 13 colonies South pastoral. industrialized South slave-based agrarian economy. North-East pushed workers rights rest country did. passed environmental protections country whole. deindustrialized rest (with terrible consequences). ahead much country gay rights legalized pot (the West led way issues though fair).

Arguably US could split 3-4 culturally economically distinct countries, Northeast one, West coast (plus Nevada Colorado) another, South Midwest last 2 (though similarities differences). call NYC.

&amp;#x200B;

Orthodox Jews hit pretty hard.

now they're donating plasma. 

lots.

&amp;#x200B;

A COVID-19 'mitzvah': Orthodox Jews donate blood plasma 36 hours later, Kaszirer boarded private jet roughly 1,000 vials blood stored coolers. drawn members community blood drive organized military-like speed. agree would I. Generally minor digging see validity, great, not, look sources. finding it. certainly going block essentially nothing mouth nose. It'll keep sneeze directly hitting face ever worn face shield near fan, know turbulent air currents curve around mask. Thats fluid dynamics. Yea thinking post Trump presidency assuming comment saying. still need Covid task force November unfortunately. even get masks make look weak, think black mask makes look pretty hardcore, like post apocalyptic movie. okay, number reported cases sufficient. Instead guess number infected.

30 million infected pool 300 million potential become infected.

What change original point number infected small portion potential infected? False statement, next. 14 million kids could face hunger due pandemic least less animals ending roadkill it’s worth people want relegate others public life completely oblivious fact clogging health system diverting resources people chronic illnesses. shit even news, guy wear mask plane boom gotta make top 10 click bait story. accent reason...

Probably headline Scotland? They're banking moronic base collateral damage. want take black brown people disproportionately affected COVID-19.  heard 1 5 Floridians may get coronavirus december 31st. That's crazy! ""Oh yes daddy make great harder""

Fucking creepy, man obnoxious attitude perpetuates problem. Maybe chances rational debate convincing lower would hope, actually engaging good faith far better chance success mindset. That's legally required collective agreements many jurisdictions. strike legally agreement expires.

I agree, retarded. Link lazy like buildings dont go away... I'm teaching online class physical classroom fall. People TB wear masks people treat people TB also wear masks. Tragic, prudent point dealing bs. really feel teachers. \*cries Florida\* Alabama here. new argument ignorant hicks ""doctors reporting deaths Covid hospitals get money.""

Please help.  No, correct, “more all”. “more except”, hence word except. prefer different wording: 193 countries world US recorded cases last 7 days 190 countries’ *total* case count. Well schools opening come hell high water august vaping deaths always made wonder around earlier realized. Nothing ever proven. Vitamin E found cases. dropped people left air conditioning, know well covid likes ac. think dead on. shut half self checkout registers sit virus infested grocery store extra 20 minutes. line got long steaming it, worker opened registers (wise choice IMO) less exposure better even means getting closer together. sad lowest paid Americans going get hit hardest, grocery workers, assembly, food production, etc. getting better medicine catches up. going fear going school. School reopenings would fine case numbers Netherlands. districts fine reopening communities cases places like Florida, Arizona, Texas California cases surging. Actually, gaining traction US. needs adopted every state. teachers worked contracted hours only, things would come standstill. much relief Liberals bending Trump's will, must said longer US get handle virus, longer it'll take Canadian economy recover.

We curious nation. Huge terms area, small terms population. US neighbor 75% exports south. dependent thriving US economy.

At point, looking unlikely non-essential travel safe end year. potential window safe travel July-September. look like US handle next couple months. time next onslaught..... understand discontent.

As stands think lot technological social progress making online learning effective going trial error. Experimenting format accept failures part parcel discovering path forward. Whether patience another story. believe wave confirmed cases due queue people ill access testing before. gone newly infected people coming testing. even possible? people wearing masks social distancing? cases coming from? Hopefully medicare overhaul, administrations would dealt like parasitic bloat almost industries. get admin necessary, much larger percent administrative bodies vs necessary efficient? many people country's jobs meaningless, made bullshit. Yea many total population? Canada adults getting $350/week. America unemployment can. since LOT states reopened, lot folks used unemployment eligible anymore. anyone recommendations mask filter inserts? I’m gonna need replace ones came masks I’m sure what’s best. Hospital workers *must* strike. There's absolutely way political leaders listen. hope reversing course this; otherwise we're headed dark road. Well Duh! investigation? happen him? Nothing me, heaven fucking help.us would hell come upon us legal fees, fines, etc. False need basic income provided pandemic take pressure schools address poverty. way children’s basic needs met home learn school. unsolvable poverty conundrum driving lot bad decisions. 4 school board members probably told voting keep children fed poor families working. don’t see voting kill/disable adults.

The virus control open school. remote learning middle/high school. Small isolated masked, outdoor possible, classes early elementary. Busing happen classes need held local parks students must walk small class shares bus windows down. (Perhaps building school gazebos parks Summer.) winter cold run school Summer instead. Oxford one potentially going ready September? Nope. live third world country, pay equivalent $150 20 masks, still have, hurt budget month, shipped China wait 2 weeks arrive.

If telling healthcare worker unable/unwilling overpay mere dozen masks, prefers put life his/her family's lives line, there's something wrong person.

Masks available nowadays, overpriced, there. Yes. relapses reinfections end results pretty much same. means get symptoms months later, possibly multiple times. website seems post lot trash. break one rules sub? ""Human nature"" mostly exist. People driven context; Stanford prison experiment showed that. tiny percentage people seem tend strongly toward good altruism (even point self-sacrifice). tiny percentage seem inveterate sadists enjoy evil sake. majority, though, take moral shape system live— people behave badly evil economic system like ours, would necessarily bad better society. can't say remember everything mask sterilization, I'm chemist myself. :P

The 175F oven technique may reduce efficiency? remember seeing tons posts sub past methods, imo UV peroxide probably safest bets go medical settings, considering access resources need top-end safety really, no. NAIAID gets information wherever like. drink streets.

Just mean allowed lol

EDIT: downvoted lol. still legal unless restaurant seating area. city doesnt give shit right now, ppl bad, misread Gov Newsom Oh my. Yes. statement made. came point extreme frustration worrying family’s health. malice intended. apologize it. Cancer survivors arent receiving treatment really vulnerable--unless they've got underlying comorbidity. Someone forwarded yesterday covers materials efficacy rates... rule since born know anything else. things disrupting normal lives like feel masks right now. purpose Phased trials does. Normally, phased trials follow participants period time new drug vaccine considered safe. 

However, lot groundwork already done COVID vaccine earlier disease, able speed process considerably already demonstrated efficacy process, adjuvents, base viral fragment protein attached to. 

Not saying watch see bad idea, personal risk level low. one thing, effective vaccine, I'd rather go people front line workers first, teachers, essential workers, since work home.  It’s “only” 500,000+ people. Good hear that’s considered acceptable number casualties read interesting explanation alcohol deemed ""essential."" 

There people addicted it. can't buy it, they'll drink horrible things, might actually die DT's.  


Those rules get set LOTS people mind. one staying hotels stay there.

Also, pandemic shown government could easily give housing homeless. myriad reasons. Tens thousands infected NYC 3 months ago, essentially zero reinfections. Italy Spain similarly. plenty opportunity. would nice bothered try read anything post. AZ governor Entitled boomers that’s why... video crowded hospital admissions hallway dozens bodies covered tarps Wuhan me. know U.S. taking seriously. Bloomberg pay ads 49 states telling former NYC haven’t come back stay away. opposite Love NY campaign.  Actually, CA still better northeast. Ca never experienced mass death like NYC/NorthEast did. Glad software engineer many countries want me. Median age slowly creeping too. 41. mid low thirties couple weeks ago. explosion cases southern states recent scale thing started beginning year. lots reports hospitals TX, FL, AZ reaching capacity, people start dying droves, without place get treatment. states soon catch to, surpass NY death rates

when NY NJ saw writing wall, closed down, something yet seeing southern states Offtopic: hate photos. every photo media least one moron wears mask false mask. else trust? somebody wrong maybe couple times? president lied us 20,000 times since elected? I'm gonna choose career professional everytime mango moron. Thank Ronald Reagan! blame nursing homes prepared, blame Cuomo pretty much forcing take covid patients.

Again, else stuffed weeks post next paragraph?

Because rate matters. Everyone's well aware NYC largest initial outbreak; raw numbers gonna high. We'll see Florida's care homes next month two; suspect pretty. wasn’t much safe protest, it’s actually constitutionally entitled protest. Nowhere say right boat. think stop college sports coaches, assistants, therapists... funnel money. mean sure sports bring money school bring enough money pay top dollar coaches. IDTS think problem see much infections younger age group 20-40 although lower percentage requiring hospitalization, fill hospitalizations age group large higher infection rate.  fucking cares? That’s sizeable portion teachers strike together. going fire everyone? brings desired effect shutting schools. number droplets produced outdoors immediately disperse breeze? rememebr first video (from Korea?) showing droplet particles closed room. demonstrated effect draft open windows particles vanish. idea reduce risk concentrated particles, think activities outdoors would impacted mask no-mask. 

Better safe though, can't argue that. would like see reasonable data regarding outdoor droplets quickly particles dispersed versus indoors. doubt looming cloud particles trailing behind run. Perhaps closest example would driving dusty road. vehicle kicks cloud dust blown away dispersed relatively quickly. dust settles isnt interacted people outdoors, unless driving right behind vehicle passing direction (in case mask would warranted comparison). scale particles kicked car far FAR greater person produces. think helps visualize point though.  not? they're at-risk population, living close quarters relative poverty. vector COVID take root.

one reasons Trudeau gave national lockdown PROTECT risk indigenous populations. biggest single factor U.S. struggling mightily whole. idea putting community widespread country countries well covid. America always selfish place. there's much pushback universal healthcare ""socialism"". ""Why pay others?"" would say majority Americans selfless great people, there's definitely good portion carry around selfish, me-first attitude, easily identifiable lack mask face they're grocery store. 

We took simple concept made feel like life death struggle rights predictably making political issue rather public health issue. people covid19 actually real minds. got fake news treatment can't put cat back bag. think decorate bands go around heads could help like idea better masks god bless teachers staff *When America sends people, they're sending best. They're sending you. They're sending you. They're sending people lots problems, they're bringing problems them. They're bringing disease. They're bringing guns. They're racists. some, assume, good people* washes hands uses Purell? thought wasn’t necessary use Purell washing hands. find whatever cursed monkey paw created hell. Yea killed many grandparents. Quiet fantastic job ask safe open windows duplex neighbors AC unit 10 feet away it? air blown right window? doctors nurses across country flown NYC hospitals prop teetering medical system. rush single hotspot, difficult multiple cities multiple states simultaneously. months well decided why? waste life BS. go hiking every weekend . got back great trip Teton. Drove thanks unemployed enough people placebo group get sick compare number people non-placebo getting sick (or not).

You need enough people placebo group get sick know working not. Almost: Live free die. stand that. People ruin lives everyday stupid shit going miss new exciting ways presented calamity, especially since many normal methods precluded supposed last forever, beginning, pain worst. cure anything (only time that), help get toughest moments. Besides, different people need different things heal, helps people (like me). one counts extended acquaintances live over. They're saying things like this: posted deep thread, want repost important point. REALLY care addressing skepticism many Americans vaccines, way tend highly educated segment, aggressive, angry bully-like approaches thread work. Here's way start address important issue. 

For one thing, stop name-calling. term ""Anti-vaxxer"" derogatory. basically says, ""I'm able willing address particular concerns I'll excuse consideration name-calling."" Honestly makes come across ignorant. 

Second, help nurture conversation specific concerns, many believe valid. children injured vaccines (I met several). Listen compassion curiosity stories. alarmed fact vaccine manufacturers exempt liability proven vaccine indeed injure someone billions dollars paid vaccine court compensate families who've proved vaccine injured children. Others alarmed shenanigans pulled drug manufacturers, faked effectiveness results. upset government pharma-funded research organizations refuse fund studies comparing outcomes vaccinated vs unvaccinated populations. I've heard concerns clinical trials conducted misleading way groups given adjuvent vaccine (the part people safety issues with) rather one group given truly benign placebo injuries adjuvent apparent. there's issue vaccines rolled soon without proper testing, risk repeating Covid-19 vaccine, caused lot worry. 

So see, vaccine issue similar politically charged issue, whether abortion death penalty, democrat vs republican, etc - is, sides valid arguments. also valid science/data reinforce sides' viewpoints. Effective conflict resolution teaches start place common ground mutual understanding appreciation hope make progress. Dude litterly traveling swine flu happened kid Maine restrict activity pretty aggressively though?  know conservative brother lives Maine bitches time. that's title says zero known infections. people going berserk wearing masks protect others, imagine crazy would testing mandatory. it’s almost like virus already killed vulnerable there’s nothing left kill sometimes start typing comment things I've read remember sources were... anyway I've read multiple times coronaviruses able lie dormant decades reemerge like shingles. lasting effects multiple organs patients worrying though, whether ore permanent effects treatable understand CDC help convince people wearing mask helps prevent spread would felt much better 139 clients tested rather less half.

What shows system place test/trace without screwed. Compared what, community colleges? Ivies cost 4-500% tuition compared decent 4-year state institutions US, HYP fully need-blind. I've taught various levels universities, including pinnacle elite, significant difference face-to-face online instruction. hmmm .. company provide health benefits? Here’s fun fact Moderna never created successful RDNA vaccine, ever. Let’s hope one works! Fun fact know Detroit east parts Florida? I'm Wisconsin, please save us Oh great hear  I'm sure follow. ER visits COVID like illness one best indicators new covid infections have. see effect policy changes first. Fucking Christ. 

Is broken record people. someone putting ""elective"" surgery months, severe medical event see specialist, able afford insulin business ""not essential,"" problem, Butch die get fix Popov Vodka along ""3 tha numbah 5 scratch offs"" allow liquor stores ""essential status"" people crowd, social distance, certainly ""need"" 12 pack White Claws. Eye opener. part argument. Two biggest population centers country hotspots right pandemic ramping highest death counts? shocking. responded starting [hopefully] come side.

Pointing purely total deaths without contextualizing point pandemic blew sheer population misrepresenting response. got hit everyone still learning thing densely populated areas country. shit lost lot people. responded accordingly. What's point? Dr Drosten assumes might studies lockdown Maybe kids can't protect pandemic guess leaders appear give flying fuck children, people teach them. Certainly using political pawns, maybe something even darker, I'm tempted believe.  made racism important apparently income inequality. Hope way patients, since high pain killers time South Texas? 😂😂 quite long time Texas something similar. showing 44 deaths day regularly like 41 45. accountant found trend exceedingly suspicious. Uh oh, make baby upset... know favorite words, ""YOU'RE FIRED!"" thought care cases here? Deaths isn’t statistic matters, else we’d applauding Florida keeping death count level even though state open 2 months (including protests Memorial Day weekend). Especially shave. Sneaky Brazilians. scabs? else suppose smell girls feet? I’m really sure. live west coast it’s called wild Wild West reason. know NY NJ strict open whatnot clearly helped get point states struggling Fucking dead lmaoo Wow. Glad NYC, they've hell get there. Yeah, see - 398 new cases last 24 hours Wales got 800-odd added combined total previous weeks. Please do. I'm bunkering part amount morons driving nuts.

\-An American. Hey masks complicated nukes “investigation” lol.

By airline customer service? Nobody cares guys. new deaths vulnerable already dead. understand ? reminds post someone made. woman assured r/covid19positive never got house weeks. husband. assured us got mail. posts later, admitted bf went pizza one day without wearing mask waited inside people there. 30 mins, couldnt possibly that. mustve mail gave husband covid. Way go Malaysia. Good job. Scraping pond snow shovels make little rink playing puck sounds like dream come true can’t even read you’re telling watch tv.

I said cable. Nothing able afford it.

I lived North East entire life. hotspot virus weeks ago. 

I sitting home watching cable tell world. fucking viewing things eyes.

I know many smug fucks like lame outdoor hobby like rock collecting think makes superior world. 

I lost family member covid spiking. going school online next semester, again. confined apartment since March. 

Did media tell stuff? personally experience it? Maybe spend time looking world around instead head ass. comes two things.

1. dense population is.

2. dense population is. far expert.

I think honestly depends vaccine eventually get, situation like area, safe/careful person are, many people interact job directly, etc.

I feel like (with specific vaccine, vaccines general), getting vaccine right away many cases understandable decision. assumes NFL would able manage get anything besides exhibition games year. honestly think season fall live? exactly saying? TLDR?  ""bEcAuSe rIgHtS"" Democrats eyes conservatives: incompetent out-of-touch can’t accomplish anything even keep straight ideology outside vague “culture wars,” simultaneously elite masterminds fronting Deep State cabal working decades propel New World Order depopulate dismantle America implement Sharia Law. 

Nope, contradictions there... Hair salons dangerous..... never know actually grey hair. Close em down. mean, what's investigate? Dude total asshole. need waste resources trying figure Gotta fecal want bomb squad? Cause that's get bomb squad. None, would screwed unless least 80% teachers went strike. way Texas would follow that, school next year, pandemic pandemic. would also piss almost every parent state. imagine they're going lower taxes even though positions get filled underqualified 1st year teachers, rushed training. interpretation inhibiting H-K/ATPase pump(proton pump) subsequently increasing stomach pH, virus could potentially make journey small intestine without denatured. absorbed replicate. Literally took two weeks get COVID test results back negative still. Still worse cyanobacteria live Maryland, things considered think we're good job. population works DC, could reasonably walk least 3 different metro stops daily commute. Maryland good amount cases across board, knew would case beginning. Honestly expected least closer NYC situation directly outside DC. 

Our governor shut stuff early. college cancelled classes literally middle week MIDTERMS. Everything moved online. careful lockdown, put huge emphasis testing catching contact tracing. re-opened stuff slowly, county, lots restrictions. least month since we've still steady decline. hospitals back capacity February. easy get test here, get one whenever want, places free. need symptoms recommendation could take every days wanted to. labs take 2-5 days results, least local testing location friends able find within half hour.

We everything perfect, makings hotspot never became one. I'm really glad living right now, part feel community trying look other. Everybody wears masks indoors, acting like idiot breaking 'covid rule' would get yelled at. think T-man's attempt undermine Fauci shows desperate is. also makes obvious considers priority; Re-election, ReOpening, public health safety.

You tell fact party members longer kowtow seen ""done"".  think part reason COVID spreads faster flu due fact don’t immunity vaccine help slow/control spread. aggregate no, speciality care yes. since examining healthcare system (as whole, medicine) saturation disease outbreak, referencing. always come something, “we’ve done testings anybody” “we lowest death rate”, people say whatever want say. important thing keep away them, protect yourself, safe. Don’t waste energy arguing them; I’ve tried unless encounter actual case lives, won’t change minds. happened deniers demanding measure stats per capita basis? HR requires doctors note states cannot wear mask yet city people ranting raving public forum last night 'freedom' wear mask. using Bible defend beliefs. politically neutral person faith deeply offended. Love neighbor move decent person everything possible safeguard lives others rather insist rights. surging state (which like half America point) need try convince dad stop visiting indoor venues. Granted difficult who're going basically convinced risk minimal. 

If listen going make hard choices whether live dad, go back mom's place. Going back forth highly risky age there's good chance asymptomatic even know carrier. really fair choose parents, pandemic forcing kids like make serious life-changing choices face adults who're blind oblivious. Props caring family! read article, tried little trolling, pretend care stupidity showing. could visit family China...(they alow foreigners like enter) months ago getting downvoted hell Indians sub stating basically guaranteed India’s cases going take become big problem. Surprise. Joe Rogan told common flu deadly Careful this, USA. It’s interesting ICE forming “citizens academy” everyone thread frothing mouth start reporting “anti-vaxxers” (and, no, “anti-vaxx”).

Just please pause consider division snitching going help country point. realize CRISIS, right? realize part reason crisis people won’t listen science wear mask, don’t think whole “super citizen” thing way forward. Dialogue. Let people feel heard. curious. Listen. share perspective. Assuming police get time. even care. Plenty law enforcement departments publicly stated wont help enforce COVID restrictions. division, democrats want strive collective good, remember Obama speech brother's keeper? concept behind progressives, want better country everyone even bit disadvantageous me.

It republican concept everyone leave alone attitude working overtime pandemic situation. Problem division, problem lies side solely seriously poor. losing point every transaction might mean much you, a) get card, b) get card designed drain itself. Imagine $3-$/day live on... 0.25 transaction fee hurts lot more. ""underbanked"" get raped stuff.  Muting moving on.

I accept surrender. Grim Reaper: ""comes tree rubs hands"" This. $1000? max penalty $750,000 jail time. got easy, especially come one virus stricken areas world right now. WANT social distancing necessity?

Want? course not. fucking pandemic. want matter.

Suck snowflake. article says 45. Dagnabbit y’all’d’ve worn masks we’d wouldn’t inna spot bother Next time try Punsch Ärtsoppa. It’s also quite disgusting. Trump gets reelected, matter months. There's literally end sight shit could go years. 


If Oxford vaccine fails, point need bite bullet figure get kids kind classroom environment safely. Yea, effective narrative is, remember good chunk ""MUH FREEDOM"" folks going acknowledge protesting open states played part debacle playing now. anything BLM protests least practiced mask wearing. worst case responsible, even freedom folks contributed debacle take precautionary measures account. last line, places attend following it. didn’t put image mind anyway Pneumonia moment... sad instead biding time letting 2020 pass safely sanely possible 2020 party vengeance 2021 . People really risking night partying . 


I look forward many parties, vacations, flights, bar lounging situations , .... later..... safer saner . felt like propaganda piece world political? can't even find political word.

Edit: still disagree fact hold author accountable realize 2 legitimate sides hard know believe without actual study. apologise arrogant announce winner argument. I'll better next time. Super Idiot!!! New No-Action Hero!! “Man, lot adverse events,” said Tony Moody, doctor researcher Duke Human Vaccine Institute. said would “unusual” vaccine rate side effects. plus side, said antibody levels produced “really encouraging.” William Haseltine, former [Harvard Medical chairs Access Health International, said levels neutralizing antibodies produced “respectable” possibly protective. said “the jury out” safety vaccine. ok answers. Science happen overnight. but, muh liberties. Well good news left wing friends....The current president going take advice lose badly. badly. That's originally tagged it, though CDC appropriate.

Edit: Changed. point would expect hospitals deny patients due staffing concerns. reaches 100 percent capacity. that? that? know elective surgeries already postponed. someone comes hospital 100 percent full gun shot wound hospital turn away? wonder why. them? situation Canada, even though I'm low-key annoyed, least tuition like $40,000 something.  agree online cheaper person never don’t expect change. Trump hasn’t really gained voters since 2016, he’s lost “unknown outsider coming drain swamp” edge, badly polls. 

He’s capable sticking whatever strategy campaign comes with

He’s desperate good economy almost great success could use would argue schools dangerous even bars clubs spread Covid. yet see evidence children less likely contract virus, stands reason larger number SHOW SYMPTOMS adults. enclosed room recirculating air. HVAC tech, suppose air shared entire school.  absolutely terrible idea open schools right believe anyone wants hidden agenda. Narrator: didn't. tell people truth ways easy understand, like this:

http://www.healthdata.org/infographic/covid19-mask-usage-meta-analysis Good luck that. seen guidelines TEA districts far?

In district still required work even tested positive - asymptomatic want school. Period. 

And yeah. said masks required. plan provide 2-3 disposable masks per child plan handle happens don’t wear them. 

Class sizes cannot made smaller “due budget constraints”. 

Have school lately? Recommendations include opening windows (none 1/4 classes windows school windows open) door supposed open (negating safety protocols fire active shooters- also causing disruption due loud hallways). 

I want stay home. love working students - want safe guidelines state use funds supposed exact things actually USE THEM. True might interesting compare. One us might blown water. interesting see anything else happens increases death rate like running one treatments. 

If happens we’re fuxked didn’t anticipate evidence running out. 

RemindMe! 1 month really. seen one different (and yes, I've several colleagues throughout North America). Professors tell lie preserve ""nobility"" academia. pretty sad, especially now. people form Florida think rules apply them? Funny, ATC union thought thing. *Trump entered china shop. source voting done via video conference? video person meeting.  guess looking centuries millennia, making progress? hand wobbles

😂 Love textual hand wobbles! agree hearing loudest 1% population. low turn Tulsa rally truly believe people taking seriously even historically anti-science. every single person America stayed quarantined 3 weeks without coming contact anyone else, would free COVID-19. 112 days, Americans. America. Land free dumb. man really want swedes danes hate other, don’t you? It’s almost like you’re trying sow discord people instead looking positive signs. 

always chosing perspective makes Sweden look bad, matter matter actually based reality.

you start bit humble acknowledge fact know little Sweden, leap assumptions conclusions every step reasoning. leads pretty wild misconceptions we’ve seen last days. sorts findings leading believe need exposed airborne viral particles several hours order contract bad case virus.

If could definitively prove that, I’d feel much comfortable grovery shopping pizza delivery job. Maybe live, everyone see one puts one go inside. Every place gone sign door stating masks required. Nobody seems yukking much, guess don’t get joke Tell look freezer get religious leaders say gods will. trump say god liar. stopped spread died out. acutely severe therefore quite scary. However, easily spread wasn’t long time someone would infecting people ill. known cases spreading people already know sick.

when whole thing started read interesting article/study SARS vs SARS-CoV-2 (early info limited) one things made major difference two terms fast wide spread SARS transmit carrier asymptomatic, hit peak viral load 2-3 days symptom onset (which usually around time hospitalized). delay infectious made SARS 1000x easier contact trace isolate stop spread.

SARS - 5 day incubation + 3 days symptoms = 8 days grace period finding first infection reaching contacts little transmission prior point, symptoms resolved within 2 weeks typically. Low rate asymptomatic persons.

SARS-CoV-2 - 5 day incubation + ~6 days symptoms = 11 days people would typically present testing. 11 days contagious least 7-8 them, symptoms typically resolve 12-21 days symptom onset. High amount asymptomatic persons.

SARS-CoV-2 basically worst kind virus severe dangerous (granted, far worse), takes super long time get there, there's large % people get little symptoms all. top airborne means super easy spread.  Oh agreed. hate people jump every trivial side effect like way comparable actually getting disease. mean sore arm reason enough people get flu vaccine boggles mind. Perhaps one silver lining pandemic clearly see true heroes society. Yup.

Pfizer used placebo phase 1 people placebo group report severe arm pain. Definitely caused vaccine, lol. trying get anti-vaxxers see error ways? everyone best interest let suffer fate? Clearly lot also anti-technology like 5G many things. less bad thing. /s Yeah! Starve virus oxygen! Florida state mind. is.

- discussing immunity
- compared infection Covid immunity mild cold
- said that’s vaccinated naturally acquired immunity it’s issue mild colds NEVER issue
- called sociopath

I don’t know called solution isn’t sustainable. know fact. realistic, you’re ridiculously left wing. 

Should socially distance wear masks forever? isolate forever? live government welfare forever? work forever? 

None sustainable sooner realise ISNT going anywhere happier you’ll be. thread circle jerk doom gloom. I’d love hear solution, solution achievable sustainable. predict 13K next week.
15K end month. live Australia lockdown concurrent flu season winter here. know deaths, here's graph tracking rate people report cough fever comparing year years: I’m thinking they’ll responsible inevitable surge North return. Cool keep fucking mask on. search sub 'November'. France, Brazil, possibly Sweden, Chicago USA reported finding cases back November, either post mortem, via sewage samples. I'm saying come China, know sure? Wuhan first epicenter, makes sense considering China's population density, Wuhan large airport hub.

Edit - also Italy. agree, areas safe. point solely government pushing (as person responded said). They’re dumb don’t even realize Trump could sailing victory right wasn’t idiot handled well start. Instead fucked around scramble.  proof Republicans actively trying kill American citizens. Trumps base: Abolish (""Obamacare"") affordable healthcare. Never wear masks. Spread virus, cuz virus free infect. hoax. Anti-vaxxers unite meet incense, essential oils, holistic intent! Screw establishment rules science. child, you, parent. wake reality, far late. then, dumbass poster, recounting ""didn't know insidious pandemic was,"" ""you never expected lose half family, despite lavender oil,"" one wore mask distanced. Well, Darwin word this. Evolution. survival fittest. Intellectually physically. Mask wearing social distancing critical surviving. brain surgery. sorry live united states, earth. Thanks answering. honestly know would handle fully full grown. makes feel childish younger self. would surprise dramatic. Outdoor activities less hazardous explains data clearly indicate correlated spikes. they're saying, dramatic Healthy paws. actually Thai protocol went effect 1 July, according ministry announcement read. (in real life course, confusion everywhere know subject meet official front you).

Whatever test MSN heard returnees:

"" Business travellers, diplomats government guests staying less 14 days considered ""fast track travellers"" swab tested disease Suvarnabhumi airport make ensure infection-free entry. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Returnees, tourists talking beach goers here, test result within 72 hours arriving. is...........impossible! takes 3 5 days get test result already missed 73 hour window. Plus, come from, takes 30 hours time leave house land Thailand. Depending live could take longer. Europe, would around 20 24 hours minimum.

The rest post crap. Next. Mmm. strange, rare form pneumonia. There’s electricity water contract. Consumables preordered year, districts area cut staff. That’s got near 8% right there. 

As buses, it’s determined it’s legal run (no social distancing) county guidelines, there’s there. I’m sure counties still pay, plenty bus drivers saying won’t go back... hard provide buses without drivers end putting breach contact. There’s million ways transportation budgets could go, sure. 

Now textbooks, they’ll stuck whatever contracts those. software agreements even can’t use them.

Edit: it’s same, kid co-op private school (meaning everyone saw budget) know staff, building utilities maintenance, transportation largest parts school budgets.

Wow that's nice. shut Europe re-opening? really amazing done around world short time.  Yeah, exactly. live area rates low dropping. things stay are, added data children potentially less likely spread makes feel confident kid starting school August.

/s Masks don’t work? That’s interesting, source? shut fuck Couldnt say Florida. California. Texas. Arizona. Theyve made choices within pandemic led lost lives. Wait USA advance voting dates?? 2/3 Floridians 😭 entire advantage Moderna vaccine production simple. impression 100 million doses end year, 100 million/month won’t really even challenge.

Distribution might issue, can’t get figured 6 months suck. whole civid-19 approach Trump Administration 'Burning Reichstag' feel it. Like another step towards fascism. thinking days now.

Edit: spelling (thank you) course going interact particles form, inescapable. particles traveling buildings every possible source outside air eventually. Wearing mask outside going prevent people trail going increase particles found proximity trail measurable amount. ""linger"" mean stay concentrated single location. spread thin every passing moment. breeze whatsoever blow away atmosphere level cannot harm anyone. else we'd much serious problem hands. Nothing we've seen indicates virus level airborne capability. So, limits. certain threshold exposure necessary, even threshold varies person-to-person.  
 
You see fine particulate matter flying around sunlight unless wildfire season. came home sun shining window brightly, lighting many fine particles floating air home. Open couple windows gone. Arguments logic would make scary implications. example: exercise hour home. generated LOT micro droplets floating around inside. would dangerous place hang anyone, assuming infected. open door draft forces particles neighborhood. increase chances everyone living nearby getting infected? doubt it. 
 
In example two people talking feet apart versus someone passing by, even straightforward. two people might talking cross wind carries droplets downwind, away both. Distance one another would meaningless situation. Also, person passing conversation 10 feet away, downwind! Perhaps wind back droplets carried 30 feet, person talking bombarded ever-dispersing particles. distance 6 feet meaningless particles carried wind much farther static space. I'm concerned people downwind anything (mask mask). watch much wind influences something like smoke grenade. Droplet particles behave identically that. introduce wind person mask. Masks remove particles. Studies shown reduction distance spread least 5 times less. still spreading particles, hence accompanied distancing. outside, particles would carried much farther! 
 
As see, argument really make sense. infection rate would astronomically worse spread easily outdoor environments. think deduce much least.  course! guarantee anything  45 people still lot. Shit, I'm sorry. hope know us assholes regard others. I'd isolate, I'm sure sub would. Keep standing firm principles, Dr. Fauci. US needs you. think maybe sphincter thats busted Spanish Vanish lol

Does mean life high literally change vaccine comes since risk need stay away risk anyways?

Everyone likes point SK, Japan, countries well masks working... uhh john hopkins shows still spikes new cases last weeks continually going up... means risk life still change. need avoid everything prevent getting it.

I guess dead kids fucked economy sticking landing one way other. hubris staggering Raptors would dispatch quick asf thing happened me, swap genders. one off-putting things someone interested say. Makes clear care feel. enjoy fitting reddit name response. mechanism children immune spreading virus anymore viruses. research article cites suggests spreading much adults symptoms lighter (less coughing onto people) lockdowns kept schools. SARS-CoV-2 infected children frequently mildly symptomatic, may weaker less frequent cough, releasing fewer infectious particles surrounding environment. Another possibility school closures occurred locations along widespread physical distancing orders, close contacts became limited households, reducing opportunities children become infected community present index cases. call bullshit this. Remember, Germans burned 6,000,000 Jews ovens collapse. 45 people good start countries lot cash-only payments may kind contact tracing capability. That's like making Bahamas pay hurricane damage Florida. naturally occurring event, one's fault, prepare it. confirmed-tested case 10 tested-confirmed covid19 cases...but ur right even ~0,5-1% huge loss life.. noooo please i'm finally feeling slightly better here. thought Arizona goofing trend, think saying here. Arizona testing turning tests around quickly 10% positive, would increase positive count model would predict August 1st. instead languished 20% awhile, hiding true numbers anyone else. 

Just today Arizona finished processing 2,500 tests July 7th another 3,000 July 8th 9th. still 70,000 tests backlog. Yikes. bought masks December. felt like crazy person. thought would never use them. started wearing March, people stared don’t care. don’t leave house, got online job pays like shit enough survive. haven’t gotten haircut since started (and reasons, hair keeps getting caught things it’s painful inconvenient I’m going salons even though they’re open). go wear mask, keep physical distance, use hand sanitizer go leave even though don’t touch anything unless 100% to. 

But doesn’t matter I’m one peasant. government actively trying kill us forcing children return schools, refusing mask mandates, spreading propaganda masks vaccines, forcing lower level government repeal precautions open open open. Every commercial mentions refers COVID suggest it’s already “we need get back road” “didn’t miss commute work?”. Someone please help us. I’m joking. I’m kidding. I’m exaggerating. won’t start get better government different hands even that’s guarantee. death toll starting roll honestly last hope people snapping taking thing seriously.

That's point, people focused ventilators, fine, complications long term catheterization. course iv injections, feeding tubes, etc. next thing know strapped try keep patients ripping tubes. government function without us. need compliance tax money keep power.  need stop letting dictate lives take power rightfully belongs us back. think depends definition ""under control,"" likely emulating transmission rates things went shit month ago (and experienced 150% case jump 30 days). That’s interesting. wonder models support claim? even point fucking retarded.

But, side effects come along robust immune response. MMR 97% effective preventing measles, one highest efficacy ratings shot worldwide.

First CDC told everyone masks waste time, instead telling people buy masks preserve healthcare workers.


THEN, flipping masks, told socially distance, far right wing protesters putting everyone danger. messaging came scientists government.


Then something worthwhile protest came up, told go protest. Even EPIDEMIOLOGISTS flipped overnight (likely terrified canceled colleges employ them), started telling people go protest.


The average person, political, smart, given mixed messaging know believe. ignore whatever easiest, living regular life.


The blame disaster lies squarely government officials scientists flipped masks protests. people interest protesting viewed ""experts"" losing credibility.


EDIT: Adding links scientists views protests;

US later onset epidemic places Europe--I think basically everywhere undercounting cases significantly February March--which helps account discrepancy ranking cases per capita deaths per capita US hard-hit European countries. also think kind dumb exclude Russia, India, Brazil here. India huge new cases per day doubled last three weeks positivity rate around 10%--their outbreak contained basically US two weeks ago. Like flu shot. taking profits FOMO sentiment. Looking Moderna's stock price last week two, positive result seems 'priced in' already. Vote me...look did.  Ever read smallpox vaccination Washington ordered revolutionary troops?

It’s almost like burned thru risk susceptible population...meanwhile LA locked them, instilled curfews them, mandates masks them, flattened curve them, getting crushed. Wonder why? find improbable -- contrary observations -- none would pick social skills experiences.

I also find improbable *magical before-time* students immense self-discipline always worked together nicely groups. internal politics many universities (and industry!) suggests even older folks can't consistently. $1000 enough. One infection cost us hundreds thousands dollars. there's risk death life long complications People like comfortable lies fit worldview. Experts say X bad? Fuck that, don’t know shit! Aww, poor man target smear....

He innocent principal man high moral grounds stand. right lots costs besides tuition. Tuition online classes in-person though, plain good. Either way, schools crooks like decades, responsible deaths many people. Compare America Europe, Japan, Korea adhering guidelines. 
That’s data, patriotic opinion I'll mention fellow Canadians. Maybe get invasion going basis humanitarian grounds? There’s one already. It’s called Tibetan Buddhism. recent study suggests immunity may decline within 20-30 days. count natural herd immunity airport I've worse LaGuardia Ataturk Airport Turkey, bombed month still chance repair properly. Today New York reported 16 deaths. Tomorrow likely more. Even NY NJ everything right, people free come state states carrying virus... refuse adopt way things (maybe fines work). Thanks posting this, failed follow title guidelines. Everyone needs see this. perfect study? No. clear masks help? Yes. got point people stab wearing masks.

Stupidity finest. Hell yeah 👍 confirm, Greenville SC terrible mask compliance. flat rate like $600.. Everyone get amount . State departments already said can’t calculate everyone’s wages could that, would take months people get paid. won’t fly, best guess it’ll $400 Reminds time Chicago got day without murders. People stupid.

I cannot argue that.  Fewer half clients tested rest refused testing. I'm happy one actually infected never know. half-ass science CDC know better. Yes, I’ve heard. 

I still don’t understand question before. asking think China making data cases hiding cases now? 

My answer no, don’t believe true.

Thinking seems hand waving one paper’s result equal doubting everything. China reports. would think nothing? feel way? Sweden achieved good outcome little restriction civil liberties, primarily voluntary compliance.

I recommend 40-page 2009 report ACLU done - terms effectiveness ethics: report trolling well? predicted everything happened last 4 months. sentiment supported virtually every health organization Western world including CDC...up February. You’re paying fit person classes. You’re paying degree gets better jobs (which you’ll still get) parties campus. 

People pissed they’re getting party campus friends. education wasn’t really better anyway. Eh, word also used anti-mask groups refer people want others wear masks ""instead minding business."" May late claim one side other. kids? going vary wildly based area, easily spend $200+ per month feed me. still eat LOT. like I'm eating expensive stuff either, eat steak like every 3 years. like five years going feel really shitty killing grandma... Anyone got real source Fox? Yep, I've proper influenza multiple times - confirm pure hell compare *at all* normal seasonal colds bugs. insurance got billed $4,600 ER visit almost passed home lot respiratory distress. real bad bout sinusitis glad get scans done make COVID-19. Thank god insurance putting 180 overall. think flight could put people medical debt must terrifying uninsured insured. people work quoting article thinking virus fake 😑

How explain dummy terms refute article show/tell it’s 100% positivity rate? KidS CaNt GeT ViRuS Thanks llama! Absolutely. I'm grateful family squadded legit lawyers. Hope got level justice also whomever miss surgery. Texas bad case freedumb Ah, people study compile facts can't trusted, should... present facts? work mind? making point me; people listen facts already.

Also situations evolve. ""Don't rush buy masks, need doctors we'll run out"" something treated permanent word cannot deviate. available. willing wait hours. Kids known extreme patience (sarcasm: sure wasn’t). Yeah, e-comm grocery/alcohol.

What's extra stupid cut pay 'tighten belts', *it's literally job gauge we're market*. market head I'm work, less pay, company rakes record profits.

Cool. _should_ arrest least investigation. I'm 2A supporter even say uncertain terms, _not_ reason draw weapon.

This person idiot. 36 child husband mom regularly tells move home ever need help.

Nice. pretty much expected normal parents  culture. Maybe something focus individualism US. I'm -- let's slap fat ass BBQ first! Yeah. It’s called iMBA program. professors degree. 25% program (foundation work) self paced using coursera, that’s one place save bundle. remaining online excellent professors lots time chances interact. class partnered 5 students help allowed (don’t to) work together assignments. look [Florida (not one state gives out), notice areas affected widespread. ALWAYS TRUE. data skewed originally could see infected areas South Florida cities Lauderhill Hileah/Allapattah. TSA agents MIA FLL airports live.

It TSA agents first got spread communities. killed old people communities. true every single city United States: Seattle(Central District), NYC(Brooklyn-JFK), DFW(Fort Worth), Atlanta. recurring trend. Port Miami employees brought this. MIA FLL TSA employees patient zeroes. One perpetrators Canadian citizen, can’t really kick one out. *chuckles* I’m danger! probably don’t even brother.

You idiot, said friend't brother moron, 24 year old, health caught virus, released hospital 2 days later complained heart problems, sent back hospital ambulance died next day.

I nothing prove disgusting idiots like live fantasy world absolute 0 humanity. 

Going block want banned sub saying really want tell you. two carrier groups supposed exactly?

Sure we're waving big gun around, what's point? Trump going start shootout? Thanks making point, prefer smear others cost vs right thing. live dane county Right. Developing first kind RNA virus, getting first two phases trials successfully, nothing. dude laptop it! It’s like fluffy centaur! Taped one first covid deaths double sheet medical tape stick MAR stickers body sheets 🥴 include potential Army Navy game?  height things NJ went curbside pickup only, actually worked pretty well. Order mobile, drive designated spots bring item you. lot retail closed able stay open way. Probably guy responsible reporting called sick. Never thought GOP would assume strategy killing base. theoretically possible there's reports infection contaminated surface according CDC. There's lot question marks meant 'survive surface'. Probably mistake, last link link gun smuggling article. also dropped jaw that. Thanks. One Canadian citizen. okay, try want. feel like they’re told they’re wrong stronger believe anyways.

It's called backfire effect;

* **The Misconception:** beliefs challenged facts, alter opinions incorporate new information **The Truth:** deepest convictions challenged contradictory evidence, beliefs get stronger.

Worse: People least one conspiracy theory tend multiple conspiracy theories.

The problem treat facts evidence; epistemology. mainly many bad tools figure reality with.

To deal backfire effect, tools, ... they're quick.

To deal bad reasoning, also tools, ... they're even less quick. mean worldometers get correct case count? generous Hyperbole thing sure mask wearing anything commonplace.

Wisconsinites want hear word putting mask outside Milwaukee Madison far I've seen. 

I complained Piggly Wiggly none employees wearing masks manager explained people complained employees (even deli) wearing masks he'd 10 complaints day people told *if saw employee wearing mask shop anymore.*

It's full stupid here. I've heard people like make first point, asked cite source, either vanish, call names.

So I'll ask you, cite source.

On point 2, realize, everyone going get this, right? stopping it. whole point flattening curve overwhelm healthcare system, successful. Welcome Texas: state rights made money matters

Union four letter word Couple interesting points:
1. Restaurant owner Trump fan right thing kicked guy out
2. customer gun seems influenced meme spreading along pro gun groups mistakenly says masks/face coverings allowed open carry regressives insane, armed. forget this. baby boomers collectively gone insane? DeSanTitanic adapted pretending hoax pretending there’s nothing done.

What useless quitter concept medical system finite overwhelmed states pretending nothing done. Fall winter waiting patiently crush rookie numbers oof. /s right? I'm downplaying anything. protests weeks now. current problem. focus current problem hand? 

Look, want argue sake arguing take elsewhere. plenty subs that. coming reason really know problem is. That’s good hear. family members located county Florida says see everyone masked go stores doctor appointments. I’m sure plenty people wearing parties things like that, good hear least compliance regards stores. two days deaths keep going down.

Where spike. way itll done 4-8 weeks even masks schools reopen. flu season coming. We're fucked lost 61K people last really bad flu season had, earth talking about? Dhey can’t take feedom dis merica know troll still: look ""Daily New Deaths United States"" graph click ""7-day moving average"" box, see 753 deaths July 13 vs 517 July 6. That's 46% increase deaths last week.

Or words: spike. asshole lung cancer he's still spewing garbage. Please use ""retarded"" insult. It’s suddenly started giving fuck foreign workers sake Reddit argument. I’m 100% pro mask whatever takes beat pandemic, don’t know anyone personally that’s infected yet. think there’s lot people don’t know anyone sick mild symptoms. said, virus scary, desire get it. Plus it’s like avoiding people wearing mask hard. What? There's difference dying thousands zero. Im sure realize that. mean... totally sure hope do. Well thought comment, oppose opening mostly ""internist"" part also evidence even asymptomatic cases getting neurological issues, also moving education online permanently IMHO desirable. Mask casket called herd immunity, works.

That even begin make sense.

And also, quite literally never does. cannot reach maintain herd immunity via natural infection. impossible.  Upset 'doom gloom' follows 'we going die anyway'

Really hope kids, go enjoy miserable wretch get habit suppressing information think ""allows people continue ot discredit threat."" Suppressing information never right away, treat people like children they'll act like children. It’s riots media/liberal response them. 

Average Americans spent months obeying orders watching media friends hyperventilate people outside beach protesting shutdowns. 

And riots came, people watched listened months admonish anyone dared even think stepping foot outside house suddenly switch positions single night declare riots fine good covid can’t spread outside. 

And moment, debate lost America. 

The average American isn’t anti-mask won’t go diatribe Facebook face diapers, longer trust media anyone warning virus because, them, seems phony nothing propaganda. two days deaths keep going down.

Where spike. earlier comment issue said, *""I'm going hold commenting see body-cam footage. ""*

Now, seen video... I'm wondering guy hopped drugs realize he'd shot cop miss many times.

**EDIT:** center mass shot dropped him, drunk guy running away three times distance? There's literally multiple articles last days confirmed cases multiple infections

Here one name local US paper reporting link articles names say multiple patients say ""no proof!"" Etc etc

It's even listed rare doctor quoted, ""uncommon"" June

The newer data even supporting it. Wait, wait, wait second. telling Best Buy still exists?!? right, bad faith argument apologize. 

But stand argument. fault property holders want use property charity, fault government, supposed use society's resources common good, prioritizing good wealthiest neglecting good poorest. would cancel  downward trend since beginning. Yes article says objective change mind provide voice silent majority. active loud minority field exert undue influence got tests results 11 days came back negative pointless there's R0 2

It's ""just."" would exceedingly high Rt given current state covid restrictions TX. Yea everyone else works every day? honest question eye goggles ear protection well? always impression open area face susceptible infection?  Let spend som minutes checking posting /commenting history.

Edit: Judging commenting history you’re probably troll factory 10years10days knows? County highest number COVID-19 related deaths Kansas's 105 counties.

To fair, one places worth living Kansas. Holy Smokers! loon! anyone know cases black river falls? Lol obvious paid shills like make sick

Who paying me? That's cops eat Subway. Wait guy said ready eat neighbors, one? obsessed this? talking brick wall. offered eat dick anti maskers could give credible information masks dknt work waste time. got called trash sheep. information tho? trying score karma points Reddit (but failing) shitting strategy outcome country even live in, think decent? think worthwhile use time? Crying crocodile tears every single bad news article find Sweden? One days... roommate Korea 2nd biggest hotspot world, decided travel 2 weeks fun. Then, went back, said quarantine 2 weeks home (me roommate move 2 weeks since want quarantine elsewhere, a** right?). time CDC officially required people coming Korea isolate 2 weeks, 1 week passed, saw posting picture god damn party. asked quarantine? said us followed CDC's guideline exception, therefore judge 😐. like speechless, seriously, f** exception might put others risk yet lady think beyong fun herself. seriously want deal type people anymore. Winnipeg. Torture flies I'm going something similar right now. negative test results yesterday still feel pretty crappy. reminding corona virus virus there. may still sick, normal seasonal virus. Hope helps! Adapt, react, readapt, apt.  darkest winter modern history. 
—Dr. Bright Gotta tell people exactly want hear pretend believe true! Validate everyone's dumb beliefs! That's gets reelected! Imagine fat american boomer whose hobby eating restauraunts get vaccine time feeling many people willing take rushed vaccine may think. I'd expect pay allowed back settled... freedoms I'm it, long eat Rush first. think sending children back chaos classroom look like fall far damage psyche waiting months e-learn. idea modern classroom somehow ingrained child's psychological development BS. Kids definitely socializing covid classroom anyways. 

edit: I'd also love hear lasting damage would caused child still next year many years school vs. catching spreading contagious disease still little about. still letting self- entitled morons in??? seem phase him, post. posts LOT love MAGA stuff. apologies then. It’d way worse date really July though. Hence claim someone lied said July smear reddit! kiss! Grocery stores killing lot people. Totally agree. would require masks, something horrible checkout systems most. care distance .That infection occuring. Best Buy

Well that’s need pandemic! fallen lowest common denominator propaganda designed stupidest people. Here’s another one right reading level.  *infects 1 person 

The speculation infected person got elevator used it, infected others, infected others. Clickbait. teachers. nurses. doctors. Etc etc etc ok poor leaders getting infected. approve graduation party photo. 😌 wonder sue school district child endangerment something similar. confused second... like wait minute, end Forida 😂 still pretty huge difference though. picture presented taken middle Arizona *the* global hotspot COVID19. 

Going party maskless distancing + context good look sure, far better done week ago. days non essential workplace shutdown: 0 No. indoor ones currently open I'm referring fully indoors air conditioning:

Magic Kingdom: Pete's Silly Sideshow (normally indoor meet greet. M&amp;G temporarily closed space converted indoor relaxation zone).

Animal Kingdom: Pizzafari (normally quick service restaurant. Restaurant temporarily closed space converted indoor relaxation zone).

(Epcot HS opening general public July 15th) Jared Polis afraid tell like is. anyone curious was, googled it. 

That mercenary army brother, Erik Prince, runs called ""Blackwater."" brother founder. could helped obeying city rules social distancing. one main sources spikes Brooklyn. that? controlled cases well. I'll never understand anyone would spend _that_ much money school, guess that's I've never anywhere close kind cash. idea expensive college biggest state University $4,000 semester think? rich pieces shit actively trying kill us. think overpopulation problem see virus perfect solution know safely isolate ride anything. wife’s aunt 1%er, they’ve isolating remote area since March. Orange County good movie made though young Jack Black supporting actor.

Words live by.  Move goal posts. Easy peasy.  even read wrote read articles. posts account nothing baseless comments mind. **No research. linking anything. facts. data.**

You nothing back shit. say yourself? going go play another game jerk go bed? waste existence.

People like take microchip. poisoned mind would better it. never take mask off. deserve speak. provide nothing world.

You cannot hide anymore. People seeing right low-life attitude.

Go ahead. Refute anything said. Refute it. Give dissertation believe, since believe things, knowledge going on. Go ahead. Enlighten me. really. There's consistent weekly pattern. getting harder follow need account rising trend top. cases stable, lowest highest Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Saturday, Friday.

Deaths Sunday, Monday, Saturday, Friday, Thursday, Wednesday, Tuesdays.

Tomorrow probably 70000 new cases ±1000. Probably live streaming rampage facebook. absolute bullshit. I'm paying 3-4k USD 8 credits summer likely uptick. NYC also protested close quarters bunch cities world without suffering resurgence. know watching Jaws, prematurely opening everything back it. ain’t wrong. Construction seems like next industry fall economy collapses. many business closed tens millions unemployed, left make huge investments construction.  I'm moderation sub, automod ridiculous because:

THE VIRUS RESPONSE POLITICAL think US shit, Dubai makes US look like chocolate cake. Took little digging two comparable graphs CDC displaying lab-confirmed cumulative influenza hospitaliations age per 100 000:

[Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza laboratory-confirmed COVID cumulative hospitalizations age per 100 000:

[Laboratory-Confirmed COVID Associated (Scroll down)

From influenza chart see:

**Influenza**

* ages 0-4: **93.3** hospitalizations per 100 000
* ages 4-17: **24.3** hospitalizations per 100 000

From COVID chart see:

**COVID**

* ages 0-4: **9.4** hospitalizations per 100 000
* ages 5-17: **4.4** hospitalizations per 100 000

So children 5 hospitalized 2019/2020 influenza rate around 10 times higher COVID.

Children 5 hospitalized 2019/2010 influenza rate 5 times higher COVID. Maybe Canada build wall. xD Whatever happens, obviously want kid's safe possible, teachers safety support staff often seen important part main narrative. Hopefully union keeps safe. wife nurse nightmare that's sure. Trump decided coronavirus hurting reelection campaign rest Republican leadership fell line.

Democrats perfect, least they're still trying. realize people work day, right? Nobody likes 23 fucking serious? ban ban idiots spreading misinformation masks obvious shills currently attacking Fauci here.  really question motivation agenda mods here. great leadership .. lots people us work feed/pay bills risking getting exposed ..we canada cerb wich paid 3 days.
We well 300 reported cases day...comparing near 2k peak..

You can't say ""we slow"" new virus still learning it..

In book fuken good job.
 Stay safe us move lol. family staying home wife, wearing masks must go out. least do. sorry idiots listen doctors begging everyone stay home wear damn piece fabric faces. yet friends barely passed science high school say masks bad! community defied social distancing mass gathered wedding parties funerals? community gave NYPD hard time trying break gathering? community wearing mask coughed FNYD? Must community hoarded N95 masks sold premium.   dont here? governor could literally done anything things might bad right now.. Worse... it’s going spill states followers refuse wear protection get tested want travel like nothing wrong. HCQ standard care world. Literally everywhere except USA western Europe. Doctors swear works. Maybe maybe (it's certainly super dramatic effect either way). lot countries afford continue given. bet end concluded mild positive effect, strong enough safe doses make big difference. way, corollary (also malaria drug), tafenoquine, promising results published today, 4 times stronger HCQ. ""indoor places"" really covered dining walls. really outdoors well. thats photos saw looked like could seen photos called 'no one left behind' education - means everyone slowed lowest denominator, accurately 'no one moves ahead' education. NYC Boston massive protests increase. main driver increase indoor bars, restaurants, gyms masks. Or...the lag we've seen. sure, ones crying ""its like flu"" ""no increase cases"" ""the increase cases due increase testing"" ""you guys saying numbers false discrediting scientists doctors whole time""


The evolution y'alls BS truly amazing Well, uh, dream scenerio would involve hundreds thousands dead Florida, yes get point. Where's guy threw shoes Bush? No, they're right.

The trick basically throttle epidemic attempt keep hospital utilization capacity choke that. That's California far, good.

There ZERO expectation virus eradicated prior everyone contracting once. ZERO expectation state keep everyone everything shuttered virus eradicated. such, California anyone reasonably quite well.

The present emergency subside everyone virus once. (Not talking ""herd immunity."") want happen sooner rather later.

Your public messaging may differ. intended herd masses one direction another sometimes ulterior reasons understand it. 8th amendment banning federal government excessive fines. New York imposing fine federal government. doesn’t apply. important look beyond death rate. thought bucks pass. Yeah, got somebody backseat covering eyes Info Systems Business Analytics. Wish studied Comp Sci Seems like bit mental gymnastics there. get criticism toward people partying lot ""not yourself"" possibility passing others older vulnerable? whether protesting partying, going train thought right decide whether lives others worth it. significant barriers acquiring skills U.S. start high cost education (which biggest). Another employment system value workers skills want to. Employers want workers feel disposable replaceable training would mean employer invested worker vested interest keeping happy better pay, good benefits, humane treatment.

There also bureaucratic barriers, especially portability credits universities certification licenses. example, licensed therapist social worker cannot work state he/she licensed without transferring license new state. often involves taking added credits added costs. seems fairly arbitrary makes difficult workers move around areas higher need (or competitive jobs). Similarly, need license significant barrier profession. Dieticians, example, license internship well often paid low rate (much case therapists social workers).

These examples. tech industry fewer issues qualifications portability credentials, they've found way around paying native employees skills better wage. import educated skilled labor countries people provided lower cost free education (e.g., India) therefore accept lower compensation service huge amount educational debt. 

The bottom line talking giving people support skill development beginning. barriers remove incentive people pursue higher level/skilled jobs need removed regulations need changed. Workers feel secure valued stay companies, ""at will"" employment chunk never feel way (and also reevaluated). rich? dollars brain cells still get Harvard. County, Missouri 

For want location house party. enough titles give locations. assuming dealing individual proper amount IQ brain cells.  includes Orange L.A. local counties impacted include Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Diego, Orange virtually every county Southern also imposed stringent restrictions in [30 including Los Angeles, Napa, Orange, Riverside, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego Ventura. counties, gyms, places worship, non-critical offices, personal care services, hair salons, barbershops malls must close indoor operations. Thousands protesters LA city alone, big contributing factor that's talked obvious reasons Sorry hear situation. Sounds like really sucks. said, probably leave country (thats little dramatic). could consider packing moving low cost living, low risk state serious this. I'm sure. work retail. I'm trolling. public 8 hours day going catch eventually. might slight fever feel run days, might get real sick. looks like heavy turnout protest Want infect entire US single month? Rely study another country apply it. I've classes actually great, degree absolutely padded useless junk make spend money. could traded lot general credits higher level courses, degree would immensely valuable contact info people sitting next plane. Yes @ 21 days exposure unless ventilators (then longer). Can’t believe know fact. order combat effectively, needed unite. “Unite die.” chose die. Yes, states definitely responsibility too, really needed united front this. No, would require leadership federal-level. going happen. people dying without getting tested. friends prefer governor de-shit-on-us We’ve taken super seriously reopened verrrrry cautiously. irritating one point I’m grateful approach now. aware program like state, unfortunately. It’s horrible situation. Either families lose half income, could lead losing house, vehicle, etc., risk endangering family’s health. decide less detrimental? mention households one parent. parent doesn’t work, family income all. fear guilt accompanies making decision like unimaginable. Another issue children rely school system safe place abuse/neglect may suffer home. don’t school safety net, left mercy abusers indefinitely. It’s absolutely horrible know anything could happening children teachers school staff act safety net lessen risk beaten, starved worse. TLDR. 31 year old man died covid. man special 135000 death US asked? Jack Helean journalist wrote article important thing report. make sure tell Jack great job. really like Gov Trump wants keep Gestapo place I've heard too. Deaths often 30 plus days diagnosis.  current new daily cases (15,000+) represent ~1,500 deaths 20 30 + days out. 21 days, Florida putting NYC+ numbers. 

 reason data seems disconnected new cases spiked fast death toll looks disproportionate. catch up.  sad thing cases baked system. Florida already exceed NYC, done deal point. Wow. That’s wild! I’m sure refugees future. people talking going buying stuff counter? using stuff fend cytokine storm, already hospital. Can't forget leaded gas either.

It phased US around 30-35 years ago effects much still us. Colorado was. We've 3 alerts since March. Kind pointless right though Plus people masking distancing after. sad thing is, please hear jumping this, (big if, know) Trump half brain, probably would better positioned tackle Clinton won. would said listen doctors, wear mask, etc. probably wouldn’t are. Clinton (or Democrat) president told people mask up, probably even people wouldn’t it. hatred real Democrat, let alone female Democrat, would’ve people protesting maybe even masks, maybe shutdowns first ordered (I know governors ordered shutdowns, probably wouldn’t implement). “(Kinsey) comes around says guy won’t put mask gun, I’m like holy sh*t. run there, I’m like hey, what’s going on? shows Trump hat,” Palmgren said. “And like Trump. Everybody’s got problems. doesn’t make difference. don’t mask on.”

The guy coming rescue cultist too. 
Kid probably feels like he’s fucking twilight zone. Centrism terms pandemic road death destruction.  think issue could possibly black white this. member secret conservative group also Conway, Bannon, Koch list. called Council National Policy. Damn I’m parent right catch virus eventually.  comfortable city's ability treat time?   medical insurance? Right. Where? Kinda meaningless otherwise.

And honestly even it’s place significant spikes, doesn’t prove much (outside already know - masks help prevent spread) since plenty places large protests (and masks) spikes NYC Chicago. get lucky. Likely no.

However, Pfizer Moderna extremely similar vaccines, even one works, others good bet. Like USA's commander chief, plan. 😌

Couldn’t Covid.  !remind 30 days  knows real numbers say backlogged probably weren’t today (they reporting like 5 day Sunday said falling behind suddenly reported 162 way late day) signed I’m ready inability certain stricken countries still first wave learn staggering.


However, would think enough people die, evolutionarily would get proper procedures drilled muscle memory second wave would manageable. Call naive though, might be. Glad clicked that. wondering Navy ship going get Arizona. One every hundred tested, one every hundred population-wise? That's felony. Lock up! It’s classic can’t afford one argument. 
I’m sure Shaming people opportunity learn acceptable here. would love see listed weekly numbers. Monday’s always low reporting, get better picture, weeks amount could work. real . course wasn’t Chinese . live Albany ny area travel anywhere. ignorance sad probably cant explain view morals warped.

The fact dont see mask wearing become sort pseudo religion exactly mean warped morals. 
Wear mask pariah
Conform relgion pariah

Its same, cant bring see it. OMG gonna get twice carbon dioxide poisoning!!!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* good know! thanks Yes, fuck him!! He's really pulling punches here. You’re sick person Trust one... anybody fantasies getting virus getting hospital see it’s like? He’s killing people. spineless piece crap hell even trying get at. Literally makes sense all. CANNOT this, DeVos. Congress allocates money schools even veto it, Congress override veto. Still, measures still mess with, CANNOT ORDER schools open! State &amp; local jurisdictions power, him! question many ‘average American’ people know woman really is? I’ve met plenty people don’t even know who’s state governor. Jesus. don’t care....fricken sad Im talking rich people donating BLM. Completely unrelated medical workers PPE. People donating covid cause same. People judgmental— like mom works oral surgeon goes work regular hours, extremely exposed, almost like people downvoted dont empathy get rocks downvoting people instead trying hear see coming from. mom doesn’t even get gown F-ing a-holes Important note study done Saxony population 4 million Corona cases 5k. 

Not mention opened following social distance mask usage. 

No way states.

Edit: word *""Business license officials issued violations casinos Aria,* [*Mandalay Silverton, nongaming Tahiti Village Vacation Club. Aria, customers pool wearing mask social distancing July 3. Mandalay Bay also failed enforce social distancing pool July 3. Silverton, customers social distance mermaid show July 2. Tahiti Village Vacation Club, customers employees wear mask properly July 9.""*

If casinos gets even temporary revocation license, I'm sure behavior change heartbeat casinos. 

This lax enforcement also want McConnell get 5 year immunity shield Covid lawsuits. acceptable providing safe work environment employees. Anti-maskers denied ventilators. saying. article National Review, I'd take huge grain salt. TL:DR fucked. wouldn’t damaging there’s way rules would followed amount time. 

Even imagine scenario suddenly children became perfect rule abiding robots, yes around people age form socialization would infinitely better not. THIS!!!  Yes you’d need convince Donald. think it’s question like would Trump logo? Donald’s signature? styled Ivanka? wife special education teacher. concerned going back. far concerned kids goes back distance learning. extremely difficult teach kids learning and/or behavioral issues remotely. vaccine manufacturing already works majority Americans either get tested wait week result... smell bullshit one. [No tells us it’s weekend. Deaths last week, see scroll bottom daily deaths shown.

If current surge due testing, percent positive would hospitalizations would increasing. mandatory law wear mask California, punishment don’t follow law. So, people continue whatever want. left dude, people except far right Thank you, grandmas grandpas, sacrifice.

-The Economy college student finished first year, semester fucking long. friends exchange students went home due COVID. means I've spent pandemic extremely limited social circle, actually mostly 2 roommates met age dorm closed. end winter semester really fucking hard mentally.

Now announced classes online. friends showing next year since exchange, well, over. also means probably meeting anyone least creating social circle next 6 months. Earlier evening passed front dorm absolutely crushed me. never felt isolated lonely, frankly know I'm going keep together another semester.

So no, one semester end world. still extremely hard college student, probably even harder kid growing up. I'm course saying sending back school good idea. also think important acknowledge comes real mental cost simple sucking ""we're together"". Everyone's situation one answer fits Testing mondays always, haven’t seen uptick deaths part.

But also, percentage positives higher no, it’s testing. Anti-maskers diet anti-vaxxers. get antifa card Yeah, sure. many fine New Yorkers went upstate westward shit went south? 

HINT: There's reason Syracuse Rochester saw increased numbers back March, Chinese. Sure, trouble. fears government taking away rights despises trying. 

Now he’s attempting thing people.  Mm. It’ll one things probably circulates forever hysteria end within year likely. able go walk work? Make new commute.... take scenic route couch table. I'm AZ hot go walk here, maybe better weather are. could go drive around block something. hoping something done Trump 130,000 cases manslaughter well. One experiment would love diverse city like LA try would flip school funding -0 years. That’s 

The property tax poorest district pays funds schools wealthiest district vice versa, see happens 

Studies shown best ROI far government spending goes money spent improving lives children 

So make poorest districts get best funding, mandate lions share funding goes teachers salaries, get rid tenure, attract best teachers, make best schools, young professionals want start families neighborhood, think boost everything. won’t giant brain drain impoverished neighborhoods anymore. looks like scans patients already suspected heart complications, rather what’s implied misleading title.

Would like know tho symptom severe flu well, anybody knowledge? Would think Covid damages heart way likely there’s different process involved? It’s quite Sparta, think need year mandatory National Service something. 
Like public works Great Depression, massive national mobilization avoid climate catastrophe. Tuesday usually big day. Tomorrow see big headlines high is.

People don’t care anymore. unfortunately, work another theme park Florida people dumb bricks. love pull mask talk. amount times tell guests put masks come counter ridiculous. i’m trying best take precautions, like constant hand washing, sanitizing, lysol, alcohol wipes, etc. florida mess. H&amp;M stores finding “loophole” speak street door open technically arent open mall, breaking mandate? lol marshalls hear Nagin convicted wire fraud, manslaughter. even talking about?  Yup, numbers sunday monday usually low, compared mondays, one higher amount deaths

29/06 - 24.052 cases e 692 deaths

22/06 - 21.597 cases e 663 deaths dunno. photos I’ve seen looks like you’re protest large city, you’re standing/walking/shouting next people duration, nearly shoulder shoulder. good number people without masks too. I’m scientist doctor, outdoors not, doesn’t sound like safe environment avoiding infection.

Local protests near home (suburbs) seem safer - room, less people. Definitely packed shoulder shoulder. He’s trying open schools nationally. beef hypocrisy. 

(He’s also threatening withhold funding don’t, doesn’t power over) Records broken... think man graduated Harvard Yale blows mind. 

Maybe going college isn’t it’s cracked State can't suspend liberty without judge signed order Well going happen anyway. amount idiots see streets restaurants closely huddled together without protection whatsoever beyond belief. like brain lacks logical reasoning. necessarily. states provide funding charter private schools. It’s called “school choice” and, surprisingly, typically controversial topic. one hand, allows parents flexibility move child better school public option substandard. hand, program allows wealthy individuals religious-based schools receive public funds. agree -- biology, chemistry, physics. 
However, kids need grow up. Frankly, American students last five seconds European Asian school onus prepare exams.

He’s like, “I right anything! Government taking away liberties! don’t right request anything me! won’t serve me? I’ll threaten gun! liberties matter! don’t!” 

It’s revealing true intentions. don’t care anyone except themselves. Unions finest.

Go back school. absolutely correlates presence Trump signs 2016 election.


It makes wonder Biden's slogan be. ""vote stay alive"" would honest one. Nah states breaks ones hiding deaths True- realize lately. Education  Exactly. Anyone thinks college education distills piece paper doesn’t get full picture. essay explains well:


http://faculty.otterbein.edu/Amills/MillsCollegeEssay.html Students really lose-lose situation.

If take year/semester off, probably find job support plus there's guarantee pandemic end 2021.

If continue pay tuition, there's still guarantee pandemic end 2021 could end paying full online degree universities still closed following years.

In scenarios, graduate worst recession ever, truncated learning, almost connections tons student loan debts.

Hopefully, student loans pardoned someone competent heart becomes President....so let's hope 2024. heart right place. Alaska big scarcely populated, people carry cash business banks ATMs hours away, that's good weather I'd say useless junk did, actually increases degrees value would've taken higher level courses.

Getting degree things want excelling one thing.

But getting degree useless junk PROOF you, individual, accomplish tasks assignments outside immediate interests, able take classes wanna take passing them, gives actual value degree earned.

All life ""useless junk"" get things really wanna do. Every job stuff wanna do. thing perfect job.

If get degree, hiring manager knows least one thing, accomplish multitude different disciplines, complete things.

My sister making like $500,000 moment, went community college Cal Poly Pomona Stanford graduated honors magna cum laude.

Still complains ""I like job, useless junk make do! Maybe find another job.... "".

Unbenknownst her, greatest skill asset useless junk. Welcome new new York. think Japan, New Zealand, Taiwan, etc etc etc used masks bring control quickly.

I think talked friends 26, 34, 22 hospitalized one ventilated take 1% reduction.

Masks easy wear, they're comfortable enough, they're easy breathe especially N95. There's excuse. wearing one basically like driving drunk. putting risk also everyone else. thoughts: curious everyone thinks...

Despite caseload surging record highs US, anyone know CONFIRMED death toll last two weeks?

2 weeks ago: 469 Last week: 137

In April, weekly death toll 16,000 worst.

Source: numbers news reporting “probable” covid deaths. “probable” death? “Meeting clinical criteria epidemiologic evidence confirmatory laboratory testing performed COVID-19”...let repeat that, CONFIRMED LAB TESTING.

Source: want argue we’ll eventually see increase death toll due lag, CDC says 1-2 week lag typically occurs numbers updated needed. cases started surging month ago high caseload April least month, would argue that, no, see significantly increasing death toll. Certainly anywhere NEAR high April.

Anyway, point/opinion this: calm down, worst shit over. Wear fuckin mask, wash hands, keep distance possible, soon enough. Uh, wut? 

They close contact wearing masks. 

Please revisit Biology 101. must really suck living someone who’s big ass yourself. 

It’s mask person. It’s message. It’s government control vs citizens ability citizens subjects. really think virus going kill anyone gets don’t you? you’re 50 there’s less 1% chance death get it. world isn’t fair people risk doesn’t mean everyone is. everyone going die fear mongering made compliant hasn’t it? 


And yes global economy tanking entire nations living spoon federal governments leave rich seems absolutely horrible. might enjoy idea impoverished subject scraping like half world today. Like said I’m going force millions poverty protect myself. 

My life isn’t worth freedoms livelihood let alone United States...and somehow that’s warped selfishness? it’s obvious health precedes everyone else’s freedoms livelihood.. selfishness. start 1 0 never “real” number traditionally. nothing time womb. want neck? Welp time open Disney. bothers most, know danger, they're stupid, even Trump. way hell putting asses line. Yeah one cover election didn’t avocado toast iPhones :( Tell get life insurance policies. Offer pay month two. need keep policy long. hypocritical criticism people wanting hurt people order get fucking hair done, criticizing people want unnecessary racially-motivated deaths going long, long time. 

The two things same. all. ""Much less likely"" mean thing ""exceedingly rare"".


Asymptomatic people spread coronavirus. fact. Symptomatic people much likely spread it, *of course*. mean asymptomatic spread incredibly rare.  lot cases at? Depending cases area schools take precautions thunk option. Could still worth shot. actually little tricky credit card companies given general mood COVID. get it, gambling addiction, gotta buy dip, sport. ferry service? attest that. close relative trying source PPE. trump voter. told never life seen much outright incompetence life. Although say military getting involved, good news PPEs supplies How? I’m good news I’ve even stoped low take good news questionable sources desperation. how? doesn’t seem possible all. Especially Russia. gloves give false sense security touch things probably would touch wearing them. also pretty early pandemic nurse made video put kind coloring gloves went store got back face coloring meant touch face.. gloves really help. Please stop making disingenuous argument. 38 thousand people died last year car accidents. 130 thousand people died Coronavirus country since MARCH. 200-300k end year. even ballpark. 

And stop acting like vaccine unlikely. coming along rapidly. seems likely we'll next year. 

And even don't, drive thing managable levels like Europe did. take calculated risks youre talking about. 

Until then, consider family's safety. sacrifice think big deal.

Edit: oh flu I'm sure go next? 24 thousand last season.

Edit 2: also hospitals enough capacity? Texas Arizona 100% capacity overloading speak. serious shit? used live Buena Vista Street Burbank right near Disney Corporate HQ guards looked like straight police officers called Disney Police...They would drive around surrounding blocks patrol. want run US, already law enforcement ready go. Yes, sources reporting.

Tuesday always slap face shit's fucked up. do? Spoiler alert: “school choice” height privilege, designed reward wealthy expense rest. makes everything worse, parents myopically focused child’s outcomes (I get it) sensitive acknowledging system works.  Thank done, do, I'm sorry horrific toll taking family. need vote incompetent fool November chance beating virus. Absolutely embarrassing stunting you, stating facts backed sources. Sorry like it, I'll step way let little bitty party yourself. Facts  hope Arizona remains 1st surge. next surge, mass gravesites.  Also masks far less effective social distancing TLDR: FYI, North Korea blocking shipment 4 months locked borders hard fear virus. This. Could agree more. need get Dan Patrick Greg Abbott they're it. war crimes imo. Trump calls ""war invisible enemy"" they're literally ignoring science common sense money save upper class, seems like Middle High class (people work home covid basically immediate effect besides contamination) low class (people can't afford stay home, often deemed ""essential"" normal upper class people want jobs, work around lot janitor,often way exposed mid/high class; besides medical staff (And nurses get paid whole lot comes living wages)) whoever wins high/mid VS low go 1% fighting corporate america greed. cannot damn thing. literally ""you're damned do, damned don't"" EVERYONE KNOW. personally know anyone C19 effecting besides laws money saved dad Navy long. Yeah, BCBS covers everywhere far tell.

That mean people understand that, limited one hospital doctors office ""in network"" 

If go ""out network"" deductible like $40k, proper emergencies excluded, that's bit grey area, yes, people going want risk it. even able afford extend trip weeks better etc. Come Florida! Plenty hiring signs here! 

/s Maybe parents teach kids things, bit behind better dying and/or causing death others? Goverona DeathSentence  Lol could be! return trip Brooklyn July 3. unloaded suitcases front hotel everything, that’s rental place was! deep-shit-O-meter started rise ass hats wearing damn mask FML. Maybe got brain damage somewhere along way? Slow testing please !!!!! Nah took basics apply med school. probably won’t YouTube classes get 😂 Apparently also protest large groups [protesting also contribute spread groups... protest. /s We'll quietly forget hospitals overwhelmed flu last year schools also shut flu. Europeans really stupid too. Canadians. usa monopoly stupidity.

We happen worst leadership right crisis. countries equally idiotic leaders. pointed people shouldnt criticize people protesting something believe in, stupid may seem someone else. What's political point? sides allowed point heard? instead shaming people go protest shut down, see criticism could used protest say beck we'd offend someone reddit points peoples screwed political points. many people willing put dead, would groups advocating zombie rights everything. Cuz rona party stop 😭 bought SPXS UVXY intraday high guess felt like bigger sell really  So... yeah... even us Germans able talk bs times xD Ok cool making sure. Sorry internet wild lately. Nope articles like absolutely help right push narrative virus Democrat hoax even though that’s true. sister says “I’m wearing mask. I’m sick”. avoid her. I’ve unfollowed her. complete opposite. blood boils. wear mask due underlying medical conditions. haven’t around lately, she’s sister. say her? What’s really good line could use make feel less human? Funny country zero supposed cases needs pandemic aid. really really good scientific article. Thanks translation. title appropriate. article kind joke, provides many smart suggestions.

It’s disaster. Makes hard work home. Thankfully job home employer allows to. mean...

The Spanish Flu killed 195K people two years.

Covid killed basically 137K 4.5 months.

We already sailing past Spanish Flu.

Remember, people died Spanish flu, mutated second year...

They also complete break new cases warmer months able prepare another wave. luxury. Sums up. Imagine Federal government nationwide testing program could see regions needed lockdown spiked Feds encouraged states follow pandemic management plan (based science numbers course) sending aid (or threatening withdraw aid) making sure areas high infection rates proper supplies enough medical staff. would unconstitutional, would it? incessant framing pandemic response terms states rights absurd really cover shitty inhumane politics. That’s true. hope holds stand decision go back forth idiots California. Fuck that. Done. League minimum $893k. I'm rookie coming nothing gladly walk $850k. That's ideal way sadly, households supportive. self-taught 3 languages that's really wanted learn parents really supportive well.

It really uncommon tho :/ Double stupidity. American way. office. every one death:

19 require hospitalization.

18 permanent heart damage.

10 permanent lung damage.

3 strokes. first. recorded SNL ep Adam Levine hosted &amp; Kendrick Lamar musical guest (or vice versa, forget), back like 2013. 

Hadn't rewatched since pandemic started, like ""real talk, advice point AF"" O:-) mechanism recall governor mayor? Instead waiting next election come around, voters hold sort impeachment replace governor/mayor someone else capable? feel like none translates well enough mean anything given insanely surging amounts cases currently happening USA. Soooooooooooo........... ok mass gather disregard social distancing? Got it. stop 2? I've wearing masks I'd never wear gloves. get amazon orders then? think flock storks drops doorstep? groceries?

You people certifiably insane. Good thing billionaires got small business loans Please elaborate, school board? committee? You’ve put tried make work I’m assuming? No. Deaths flat going down. 84%* People think believing science numbers means ""positive"" ""negative"" person. 

I told someone lives Florida likely multiple rolling shut downs Chicago. told thought pessimistic. 

I like gave prediction scientist said, used information make negative assessment personal character. boomer move. hell button change back French...it's absolutely illegible English New York: 32,445 Covid deaths, 1,668 deaths per million people.

Florida: 4,277 Covid deaths, 115 deaths per million people.

Deranged people believe Cuomo great job. Meanwhile positive rate Florida decreased three days testing 300,000 people. large portion protesters wearing masks.

Additionally, protests tend keep moving, around people extended periods time - viral load key spreading disease.

The speculation, one month start protests, epidemiologists seen correlation increases rates infection participation protests. really get insanely expensive private schools wealthy areas. public schools already exclusive difficult even get district. Housing expensive. people go beyond send kids $50k/yr private high schools. Why? Literally baffling me. agree virus takes priority government really step put safety net place and...I’m worried. don’t get much done. European countries instituted basic income months ago already, well. don’t see another solution even imperfect. re-elected Nah.. want make sure saw shit kid. shitty situation, using get internet points insult anonymous strangers disagree gross. gross. 
I'd say poor role model, know autistic kids role models aspirations kind. good role model. Lol. needs removed office people die. That's wear two condoms mean yeah I'm sure people visiting NYC safe versus way around. virtual one, geez. I’ve zoom meetings months. It’s best, it’s hard. over, expect DeSantis jail hundred thousand counts manslaughter.

Lol he'll probably win primaries next presidential candidate one parties. think lots w protesters also wearing masks dumb fucks. mother-in-law teaches kindergarten. met class online groups five would get individualized attention would read math them. sent home box supplies could say take whiteboard red pen could follow along. even sent every kid tray little box colorful sand could practice writing letters sand. recorded videos reading bedtime stories could listen watch school hours. worked lunch pickups kids stop could wave them. sent home pre-stamped envelopes could pen pals back forth practice writing. every day wore different costume students would get excited see wearing. always wanted check see her.

Is perfect? No. we're certainly giving them. terrible what's happening. feel families kids. OMG!!! patience started reopening? rushed reopening, rushed reopening, he's patient see mask request nudge cases down. Outrageous!  Exactly. would want risk entire generation kids ‘let’s open schools’? Yeah many colleges going go bankrupt even without crisis. northeast looking 30-50% schools closing next 10 years works normal year. Corona slight breeze great news means large gathering people chanting, singing, screaming cause COVID-19 surge. China still much lower amount technology(independently achieved, is), 1/3 less GDP, enmity almost *all* main Great Powers, Petrodollar equivalent navy wrest it.

And forget foreign service. Great Powers spit fire.

Roosevelt,Truman Eisenhower played game well enough last generations. China many inherent advantages nation basically got Warren Buffet way basically every pie WW2.

Not even Trump could mess *that* whole generation. already is.

you _literally_ know true, mate :) 

you HOPE true, based wild ass guesses.... 

There solid data ""unreported cases"" , right? 

As said - HOPE right.....  need assume / act basis WORST CASE, ok?

Wash hands. Wear Mask, avoid groups people - smart. pension would kind link statements showing one Florida received $600 bonuses unemployment? cases per capita would 300,000 daily... Politicians supposed compromise taint wart. Meh. Florida 7x population Arizona, substantial Brazilian population well. might seem like they're competing right now, Florida's long game (of death).

Texas, however... It'll interesting watch Miami v Houston death match. I’m expert Florida’s numbers relatives state pay attention things. Didn’t spring break correlate spike cases two weeks later (spring break “event” much series weeks celebrations)? 4th July another loosening sorts people heading beaches bars no? new form roasting? Making America great again. - Donald Trump Daily hospitalizations still going up. Almost back old NYC / NJ numbers. Maybe hospitals better cope time since purely one area seems still hitting 60k cases daily. ya expect get worse real quick. know people die right away this. month hospital bed   really need closely examine US politics, yikes Lina Hidalgo kinda cute Love governor!! cops would 100% done anything. tons lunatics running around armed times area. highly doubt patting gun otherwise bringing attention would make police bat eye. say hear Putin giving ""special version"" completed early journalists political opponents first. great leader. fuck So, still wearing silly hats they’re still waiting happen? Good luck parents kids elementary school full time jobs. grew Cass County. 2004 probably trending there. Behind times understatement. Florida, Texas, I'm banned too. indoor protest Even normal pre-Covid circumstances, caught bugs consistently planes. could pay get airplane middle pandemic. Half man, half pig! Send goods mail. Electronic fund transfers. clowns would rather wear red nose makeup simple mask! get pretty dope masks! Hella rock bands 🤘🏼 per capita, stated, apparently reading comprehension minimal best.  

Learn read, bring sources actually work.

Edit: long term care facilities* reason, first step bend over...
Second step close eyes... Yeah things looking good. already headed towards recession, manufacturing output declining since end 2019. coming inflationary period debt burden vastly outweighs income, people corporations deleverage covid hits us like truck. Unlike supply crisis fixed central bank extending credit, demand crisis. People buying, people borrowing. Lending contracted, debt-based economy good, need people continue borrowing money created inflation occurs within certain levels Fed targets.

Well, tool Fed keep things going lower interest rates incentivize people borrow buy stuff. problem Fed cannot make people buy, that's we're seeing, people scared, unemployed buying bare minimum get by.

The stock market time highs rich people incorrectly believe equity safest place keep money safeguard coming inflation Fed ""printing money"". Particularly they're invested tech, mostly concentrated big five six tech companies. money Fed prints enter economy, cannot cause inflation, stays reserve accounts retail banks cannot withdraw collateral exchange treasury securities. Fed increase liquidity foreign banks service debts.

On top demographic shift rich boomers retiring taking money stock market, cause stocks go since millenials wealthy enough compensate amount money boomers have. Retirees spend much money, they're interested low interest rates they're good consumers drive economy, millenials borrow. wait, millenials already indebted student loans health care costs, Fed wants go debt save economy. 

Millenials sensitive wealth inequality, friction have's not's time high. There's social unrest, there's political party pathologically denies reality never suffers consequences decisions (if politician orders schools open, teachers students pay price, listen person unloaded risk decision unto you??) 

The Fed continue lower interest rates, attempt stimulate economy, rates already pretty low even covid hit, there's much room left rates drop (this Trump floated idea negative rates). quantitative easing Fed done seems resulting deflation instead inflation. asset prices go down, rich people mad, young people mad reasons, clusterfuck mad likely result political changes. 

In past, get economic situation deflationary period, one needs war economy, put everyone work lot government spending. I'm sure good idea deficit high already. Bad times loom ahead, austerity, currency devaluation, higher taxes (their last resort) could future. probably weakest United States ever been. Everything converged moment time (demographic shift, pandemic, corrupt leadership, biggest wealth inequality levels since 1929, racial tensions, social unrest) we're responding problems slowly, ineffectively. called boss, call make. owner let go. I'm surprised owner balls get yelling match loon gun, frankly. took make even leave. like guy going stand around wait cops come, either, so.... point analysis? Next list statements regret saying.

Give weeks he'll eating words. Yeah kind rhetorical question. could tell hadn't. Hahaha. Ha can’t emergency food assistance program though? far socialization acedemic skills, wouldn’t couple month hiatus? seems like problems dealt way sending maskless enclosed spaces hundreds children middle pandemic. parents going back work putting kids covid-laden daycare centers. Damned closed, damned Luckily place stay home son remote learning. whole situation utter mess feel teachers school administrators right now. Agreed ! See? downward trend. open disneyworld now. It’s patients, it’s public, it’s them. got free tacos shift taco Tuesday local Mexican restaurant appreciation (I card hand said house). I’ve gotten dirty looks stopping store diapers infant son way home. People went way stay away me. one guy say “thanks do, probably outside. I’ll buy whole cart walk car, need get out, you’ll make people sick.” I’ve wearing mask since mandated. Oh god. love Lonely Island yet never heard seen that. What! Hahahahaha. WISH family meant ""you ought look out!"" They're definitely Russian Hey, Floridian Canada. great here! learn honest numbers... Schools quickly become mass exposure sites forced quarantine. Well can't run governor unless runs something else, unlikely... lmao like low key roast? can't really tell...hahaha Hell no. Hahaha. worst week virus killing like 8k day worldwide (2k day US) back April. Trump 2.0, incompetent don’t fucking run public office. embarrassment basically remember hearing well; fashion became cheaper/easier companies offer healthcare instead wages companies started using way attract workers instead increased wages. while, level employer-provided insurance became normalized, today. went wrong many years ago. certain types AC okay too. problem aren’t - like central heating systems. 1st surge. I'd guess two better one. muh freedoms- people Texas, probably. know might think Chinese purely taking piss, actually semi-serious.

Despite poor handling far still things US worth learning from. Clearly US health infrastructure robust ways, think China handle 70k confirmed cases day across country many days.

And also, ability reinforce medical infrastructure hospital ship interesting capability, I'm sure China writing down.

Edit: another thing think many people seem talking US convalescent blood plasma program. Despite late party US able rapidly scale convalescent blood plasma reserve deploy them. That's worth learning from. honestly incredible much progress we've made towards vaccine. less year we've gone knowing almost nothing ""not when"" vaccines. relief widely available vaccine, even needs booster shot while. hope Abbott goes trial this. really. explain he's US Drosten. think face harsh punishments doing.  like jaywalking.  135k people dead morons refuse told.  need zero tolerance policy behavior future nation may well depend it. Thank you. pls leave Monke this. want bbq banana. China created monster, first virus blame for. Corona says, “Hold beer”  say 8th amendment didn’t apply? said bill rights doesn’t automatically apply states selectively incorporated sure downvoted. Yes, stacking surgical cloth masks double protection, improve filtration. Gloves anything combined proper hand hygiene unless open wounds hands. Yeah misspoke. Meant 1 rather 0. like “we survived COVID far”, probably won’t try r/nothingeverhappens comply law without fucking brandishing gun.  love reference. Bravo. Friends friends pals pals, butbuddies sleep together.  Seriously - anyone explain even possible  $200K/year income lower middle class family. mind. I'm least perplexed. Herd immunity effects + people spending time outdoors explains it. can't believe still talking national shutdown. That's way get this. fair, nobody know mid-term long range impacts might be. Might behoove people read *working paper* article first thing article bases conclusion yet actually reviewed published NBER working papers circulated discussion comment purposes. been
peer-reviewed subject review NBER Board Directors accompanies
official NBER publications.

Second, saying people protests spread virus. want think that, actually nuanced feel kind intellectually dishonest. indoor vs. outdoor, whether mass gatherings good idea. They're not. Instead *net effect*, may true, kind bullshit However, whether Black Lives Matter protests actually caused increase the
spread COVID-19 open question. protests large gatherings
that match well social distancing guidelines, protesting population only
one may behavioral response. example, individuals wish to
participate protests, perhaps due fear violence police clashes general unrest,
may chosen avoid public spaces protests underway. could an
offsetting effect, increasing social distancing behavior parts population. net
effect, social distancing spread COVID-19 thus empirical question,
and focus study

They're saying protests may lead people staying home. question whether **increased spread virus due protests** offset **reduction non-protest goers spreading virus**. words, whether social distancing caused protests enough offset social distancing ignored protests. 

It socially righteous causes suddenly make immune viral spread. basic logic. situation causes spread:
1. Thousands people **not** gathering closely together outside
2. Thousands people gathering closely outside

Admitting #2 causes spread make BLM bad protesters bad. add nuance discussion. make gnashing teeth (very misled stupid opinion) lockdown protests bit less clear cut. Oh please.  Trump's death cult members deserve benefit doubt.  Lmao, people get away things 1000000x worse he's done good dude. God bless god bless backdoor sluts 9! Post /r/progun watch idiots think proper firearm safety Thanks destroying millenial gex generations, boomers. Lord Rings, people called Gandalf ""Stormcrow"" saw come around warning bad things coming. Wait.. wear masks outdoors? close together people getting masks worn outside too?

I understand mask wearing protests close quarters group gatherings inside outside idea Covid would go away fall summer heat moronic.

Wuhan temperate zone lowest goes around 30 coldest 90 hottest. It’s muggy, humid shitty.

The virus came hot hell hole wouldn’t bat eye heat. (Pun intended, keeping it)  ultimate goal destroy public school system. supports school choice programs, school vouchers, charter schools. doubts wants public schools disaster zones shut down. think they're honestly imagining scenario future Western nations let COVID19 burn population exist like low lying coronaviruses deal increased mortality. china deal international travel? keep wearing masks quarantining forever? Etc.

In scenario, whole country powder keg ticking time bomb, since 1.3 billion still susceptible. That's fascinatingly stupid. got global pandemic going around guys angry something simple like wearing mask. Same. I'm self employed PUA thing I'll ever qualify for. I'm hoping gets extended thought gloves spread disease better? Skin porous irregular latex. go toll booths new york example. look license plate enter state  Colorado. are...I wear one public go military base nearby shop (retired military) since required DoD installations. one China, maybe. They're actually going trial phases. they're kind borderline unethical they're using military test subjects, they're trials nonetheless.

The Russian vaccine though still barely would considered phase one trials, yet they're projecting releasing vaccine? thank you. November 2016, specifically. made think attending lecture halls 300+ students really better? people partying feel right move freely uninhibited. “ freedoms “ taken away. Whether agree important issue them. say doesn’t matter don’t right endanger people lives. goes BLM people. issue may important don’t get danger people lives. parties wrong. 

(I’d also like add protest BLM since 2014 nearly many people showed pandemic. maybe isn’t much care issue perhaps might selfish reasons. Like getting house. know lots people went, drank “ great time” protests Bay Area)

My personal hot take reason see excuses people protests site people left leaning much like protestors much willing make excuses them. like right makes excuses people wearing masks complaining freedom rights. 

Basically another way politicized. *yeehaw it? read report said OFFER online courses. mandated. saw nurses hospital this. think it’s overkill n95 proper seal. Oh wow thought freedom comment joke. actually serious. mean, seeing employees get everything verbally physically abused actually getting murdered trying enforce mask laws, isn’t surprising. 
I wouldn’t want one ask people put mask on. 
You’re already risk working pandemic, wonder you’re gonna get punched spit shot you’ve involuntarily enlisted public health information corps. 

We need nation-wide mandate mask 2020. feel like guns loaded blanks. You’re fuckin douchebag lol. Put edit. saw people jokingly comment he'd say rate additional cases dropped little today. can't believe he's done this. total moron (getting law degree mean moron still). Sell off? I'm 1.5% overall .04% today. want break even sell again, long money printer go brrrr rug pull thing remaining covid mega corporations? 

I'm interested see goes I'm interested see happens retirees pull investments millenials expected fill gaps.

Edit: think Biden bring markets November either. I'm pretty sure Wall St cool taking see clear winners start emerge green energy next years. perfect response exi... Damn. Round morons throw prison infect instead us. doctor presumed positive early March. took Quest antibody test late June, came back negative.

What antibody tests there? How's accuracy? T-cell tests? would one go getting one?

I feel like ton anxiety would released knew sort immunity. Sigh. do, then? Write congressmen? 

No put daycare. makes sense. Daycare open schools closed? basically spending lot money put enclosed recycled air space school except without education, indefinite amount time. bet next solution close daycares heater on? Unbelievable! Legal rich/powerful people. Good thing situation stabilized there. Greg Abbott said Texans “would comply” issued statewide shutdown, instead asking local authorities enforce mask mandate limits social gatherings enacted early July.

I mean yeah. He's wrong

 nice see showing incompetence. get vaccine enough people willing take, thing going seesaw back forth across country..spread mainly asymptomatic people children.

If schools opened like Orange Menace would like, see 275-300K easy November.  go University Phoenix (online works better work schedule Dad successful alumni). 

Professors mainly facilitators - meaning they'll help but, grade work keep schedule. basically like - ""here's curriculum, here's chapters need read, discussion posts assignments need complete, hesitate ask questions!"" 

I single lecture video, group class call. videos share recent helpful class work - but, basically feels like enrolled structured self-teaching lol *unless took part protests/riots exotic meats luxury good lol. Chinese working middle class eating pangolin bat. couple teacher friends Houston terrified. many responsible Texans going get hurt Abbott's bullshit. fake test can't hide sickness Nothing protests spreading...... lost two days ago. husband scrambling coverage companies make difficult find pricing possible. Medicaid, come! this, unless 1.3 mil ppl packed size san francisco, virus spread easily ordered counties open businesses

I cousin Lyme.. aunt uncle supposed stop putting food table? Wait next government check “okay you’re allowed go pickup pieces now” imagine kind person would see path would choose cross street. I'm even talking virus. “Florida, Texas, we’re much flatter, means goes longer. said wanted flatter curve, it’s drawn longer period time … boom bust.”

-Ron DeSantis July 10th 2020

Oh he's worse nothing. He's actively suggesting significant rise cases help control virus. CDC lag death reporting. forgetting lag confirmation death another 2-3 weeks. already know Jew is. talking Judaism Jews follow converted to. Nope, Israelites Jewish, still Canaanite core. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Edmonton &amp; Toronto Condolences man. said mortality rate 25's 0.1% - someone Reddit maths thread can't find worked that's 14,000 kids happy accept cannon fodder small sacrifice (and I'm copy editor). Plus, I'm willing dip fries malt vinegar rather drown corn-syrupy ketchup. Florida opened Disney World lol. Crazy times Aussie rules football (AFL) playing Grand Final October, since Australia got covid19 control fast.  

A lot American networks picked year.  think fans stands covid, pretty thrilling TV anyway, since fast moving game.

There's 4 minute YouTube video explaining basic AFL rules floating around. not, Kansas allows open carry. contact tracing, limits testing, significant decrease/downward trend cases. know..what countries control Soon become Trump’s favorite medical expert, replacing Fauci... Media would selectively give publicity protestors fit narrative.

This help discourse. That's really interesting! suspect ban fueled large part sharing border Quebec time things unfortunately going badly there. Lots fear small province cases next large province many cases.

my faith US taking actions global climate crisis bottom, I'm afraid US take actions even entire human race literally enters extinction phase. Bro - agreeing here. administration bungled whole thing. Part Fauci bungling lying American public.

It’s summer? honestly can't imagine future holds us November really scares me. hitting phase control Healthcare systems starting collapse multiple states. governors nothing shy mass manslaughter. thing could equally argue virus transmit easily 90% compliance enough suppress outbreak enough safely reopen month. month base number still big enough reopen immediately flair like crazy.

Where forceful shutdown, say 99% compliance might reduce R0 far enough month virus nearly gone. build steam apply measures like full population test gone good area. It’s law. Can’t stop interstate travel bad forever. develop treatments even vaccine takes time. endured sort thing before- many times- get time too. need support other... cannot alone. I’ve given long ago trying tell people freedoms end others’ begin. country built ideal freedom, US full people can’t grasp concept. that, group Utah coordinating bullshit events people without masks mobbing local grocery stores parts state require masks. 

I really really hate state sometimes. trying defend DeMoron, plenty evidence children spread virus lesser extent (though obviously still do).  anti-virus POV. really fond Pro-virus sentiment. Issue number one. Covid politicized beginning. Thus creating massive division people generally feel COVID-19. Thanks Democrats Republicans always eachother's throats.

This kind politicians deserve, done nothing put real leaders positions actually make real differences. Politicians today stupid easily manipulated general population try manipulate. Mirror: http://archive.is/Vl1TN number death increase 1%, means 1000 families lost loved ones. explains it, pretty hard spread everyone actually taking proper precautions barely tenth percent population tested positive 4 months.  kids get sick sent home. Except minus thousands sick kids May June best months last years. Remind six months lmao make laugh long process could ensure everyone could receive care even laid off. person advocating year, option change things. process artificially cut short certain wealthy groups would rather die take single fucking step left. Basically none. Someone forgot Jewish, Hebrew, Israelite history also we've land 2000+ years LONGER Diaspora Jews. went head, it? rhetoric top. Hes exhausting person. Anyone uses phrase ""keep drinking kool-aid"" either troll making unintentionally ironic statement. unfortunately, can't cure stupidity. Don’t worry, coronavirus soon teach lesson... feel addressed comment. It’s Orange Co. I’m sure Riverside make vapid choice. go, Republic Southern Cali. put South Southern California. Eh well least safely assume majority older Republican, bad seems. second time today I've heard Detroit north Canada. Baader-Meinhof phenomenon crazy. Better streets guns, threatening government officials, couldn’t go shopping get haircut. Big fucking babies, crying couldn’t go spend money. least standing something important. Leave important stuff grownups. would probably push spread further. Wouldnt it? People remove mask accidently touch face? Yep, pandemic going last forever, didn’t hear?!? Genuine question? get caught? know people lie contact tracers dont see anyone actually get fined. every developed nation shit diaper hard america has? seems uniquely american issue. Right - indeed terrifying. School-aged kids, service workers, construction workers...we might well call are: modern-day covid fodder service avarice. barista dies covid? problem! We’ve got 20 people line job! Roofer needs stay home care covid-ridden mother? Anyone hammer couple nails! kid died school? worr...wait die covid school shooting (we need know she’s within covid margin error)? Another doctor dead result treating covid patients? call Emergency Medical Hologram state nature medical emergency. agree think things fauci could better :

-	acknowledging confirming giving credibility needed proactive timely manner. Reading random things news explanations get latest info discouraging. CDC fauci seem slow here. Maybe like “data” fauci could stop adjectives speak directly stuff  
-	he definitely played politics mask early on. Hard forgive good amount people won’t wear since keep hearing conflicted things. be. refrenced mask gun illegal (its not), would make statement along lines ""make me"" ""good luck that"" also showing gun. also depends state allows open carry. Showing gun necessarily illegal. Refrencing illegal either default. articulate imminent serious bodily harm death/willingness deply said weapon get threatening territory. none things. moron definitely unreasonable asshole, neither thise things illegal. reflect poorly person character. Americans exactly stupid, feel entitled EVERYTHING. extremely annoying, president partly blame this.  Funny, University charged extra premium online courses attending. look Florida causes death last months compare pneumonia deaths months previous years. Much higher 2020 past years. Coronavirus likes this... cuntrarians like say! Yet another reason get GOP strategy here. ""You know what'll make sure get re-elected months' time, hundreds thousands dead? Millions evictions!"" What's game plan here? toddler could better. sub likes one sided POV huh? mean schools closed. course spread. people. user bot ability reach archived data recover deleted comments cowards aren’t willing stand stupid shit occasionally say. Got bit explanation response comment. Even without explanation, man. Man. need. They're already living fantasy land. long Florida? I’m thinking month there’s enough outbreaks get shutdown. good job, apartment finished college sophomore graduation(5 year degree). something could freshman though. doable quite universally doable. already it, imagine that. virus powerful need test know one pre-symptomatic probably get infected. Texas huge hot spot right coming state probably horrible idea general. I'm Manitoba. We've done great job. still dummies believe hoax few.

While we're cautious, nice know chances getting slim.

Keep us border closed vaccine. I'm sorry going that. foundation country!! disagree someone politically silence threat deadly force. Washington would proud patriot I’m government position. So, unfortunately can’t make decisions. 

Funny quickly Americans went “the greatest country earth” “why isn’t country accepting American refugees”

Edit: plus, one going take Americans refugees. cases 70,000 rising everyday. Covid is. system (and therefor impact covid) isn’t. person never actually lived third world country could say that. born third world country US problems far that. Besides let tell cynical demoralized attitude espousing makes third world countries unable properly develop. mean sarcastic way schools agreeing open? go in. Send messages keep kids home. Effectively would protest, get support entire world. Trump De Vos making children lambs slaughter. He's banking herd immunity now. dumb people stupid things? another conspiracy theory you, throw face. one get thinking, nothing will:

Back day, conspiracy theories CIA intelligence agencies illegal dangerous stuff, either without explicit knowledge government. Plotting assassinations, overthrowing governments, starting supporting wars, selling drugs America, smuggling weapons etc.

CIA started attack conspiracy theories directly, approach work expected, many conspiracy theories proved true beyond doubt years decades came up, CIA alarmed future cover.

So came conspiracy theories include CIA easily debunked science, spoon-fed conspiracy theorists feared most. Unfortunately, conspiracy theorists fell easy bait, considered nuts population. CIA mission achieved. mean stupid people linked non-compliance? type study needs shown everywhere billboards tv’s saying dumber likely won’t wear mask people aren’t complying less likely wear mask fear outed moron. Won’t work morons need many morons wearing masks possible. can't believe live state idiots. Supposedly professional sports available, think shifted mediums coronavirus numbers racing states. may well low key pushing get way. probably actually. doesnt really matter failed meet threshold prosecution. police generally keen arbitrarily arresting people. ties court something arrested person walk on. end wrongly arrested paid pretty penny trouble.

I never claimed maga turd right, surely not. wrong instantly make actions criminal. 

Point fact, make threats present weapon devil dog boss started yelling article clearly states yelled him. maga man looking fight excuse draw weapon (even poor one) , would escalated point. article articulate event occuring. Add, Telescopic microscopic vision. Enhanced mental processing memory, older comics super hypnotism, plus cant remember. Keep science, away politics coincidence..... 2-3 weeks protests..... would ever seen coming.....  Agree. 

I’m wine sales Napa Valley I’m shocked many people traveling Texas Florida go tasting. It’s insane. 

Most clients I’ve hosted 60’s 70’s too. Well split y’all add this, online courses, given syllabus schedule due dates. must dig course material figure important. Many students accustomed spoon-fed lecture developed skillset figure own. 10% 10% didn’t use number. used percent. reason people using number DeVos cowardly admit tiny mortality rate spread across nation would big number dead kids. loss words guess get die. Thanks deciding, decider That's delusional Donald Trump saying go away sun starts shining April.

If masks alone enough stop COVID, cases would surging Hong Kong right now. Questions made genuine curiosity often interpreted combativeness opposition

The problem ""skeptics"" usually start leading questions like bad faith. ""How know sun?"" they'll ask, provided link explanation they'll move next dozen talking points makes obvious merely curios. Gaslighting astro-turfing potent mix.

Unfortunately squeezes genuinely curios, ""skeptics"" like half land side. 100k people already died time protests riots gathered momentum became nationwide. Things already fucked leadership-level, wrong pin protests. NYC protests, they've seen spike cases like Arizona Florida, example. lot different possible outcomes. Looking history guide, pandemics typically seem limited shelf life. importantly, countries around world great success lockdown measures, encouraging. frustrating stuck US particularly bad area, public eventually come around. 2018.. Hospitals overwhelmed influenza patients.. treating tents. Strictly political presidential election, especially FL swing state TX polled even (not sure believe this). moment shutdown again, think Trump guaranteed loss FL possibly TX

I even know I'm typing that. Bunkerbitch re-elected even topic discussion debate "" true — even early estimate [10,000 might U.S. turned wrong ""

So trust man gave wildly inaccurate prediction based ill conceived premises? let's flip table around. would've happened trusted opinion rather Dr. Fauci's getgo? many casualties would have? going say ""oops!?"" 120,000 prediction die?

Btw, scientists doctors around world care US partisanship, conclusions seems match Dr. Fauci's his.

What egalomaniac crybaby victim mentality.

Just like Dr. Watson wrong racist view genetics people Africa, wrong statistics even expert field. accept it. Well, might witness society advancing one funeral time.. front page search coronavirus country, likely bring specific sub it. ""So what?"" without precautions, board released white paper Requiring students wear masks “is difficult may even harmful time.” I'm surprised college students created movement go school year price hikes. mean nothing destroy economy peoples lives disease less 1% death rate? 
You mean kept people jobs learned commiefornia shutdowns dont shit?

You mean new york 33 k deaths florida 4.5 k despite new yorks shut down.

Okay liberals. Keep burning targets sub got sad Go back 6 months tell summer - bars drive drink service. Countries start offering man asylum; many value experience expertise. Projecting racism someone calling literal facts, nicely done.

You agree motives movement also acknowledging tens thousands people repeatedly clumping en masse across country helped spread pandemic.

Just look data, things weren’t great protests realatively stable, suddenly surged back within couple weeks protests 🤔 

Not everything political. lol, walmart home depot stayed open could care less enforcing masks.  one time twin brother line get food restaurant. old man came without mask stood behind brother three feet. brother got bit nervous mostly concerned old guy's well-being due dozen new cases area virus, spotted mask pocket. brother politely asked wear mask.

The old man, course, took offence started make ""coughs"". brother made reach pocket old man turned directly made inhale make big ""cough"", time bro pulled hand sanitizer spray sprayed old geezer's mouth. 

The old geezer started cough real cursed profanity en Espanol. 

My brother went ahead said, ""and wear mask"" So, terms deaths/cases per capita rank, exactly? someone grew let explain. 

One main reasons virus people take precautions. wear masks, avoid public, distance themselves. 

While might inclined think unremarkable piece swamp, mosquitoes, lack topography, brutal winters imaginable hosts diligent intelligent people planet stopping virus tracks astute leadership. case; wrong. 

The actual reason somewhat counter intuitive: medical care sucks nobody wants rely it. good doctors (see above), old rundown hospitals, long wait times, let's say hospital waiting environment offer unique cultural enrichment unacquainted. talk like THAT?! .. currently accepting political refugees United States?   Asian, say basically common sense. find western people lack certain discipline. remember get bulk funding State Dept. Education. like Gov. Newsom intervened closing indoor dining &amp; gyms county leaders slow act, budgetary repercussions &amp; mandates office board members ignore data &amp; try force students, faculty &amp; staff return virus raging. disappear heat, though shockingly enough warmer states seeing virus spreading like crazy peak heat. 100F outside today North Texas we're getting 10k cases day now. definitely number officials refusing enforce crazy reasons. However, also large number sheriffs LE saying won’t enforce real authority measures it. arrest detain someone start writing ticket mask, laugh walk literally forbidden Abbott’s order stop you. rather wade insanity, lot LE departments saying focusing elsewhere. Keep politics away science. Orange County opening masks! Idiots Incompatible Covid ? statement based ? head small relative body, looks strange Well, no.

A “typical” vaccine gives long term lifelong immunity, measured years. Chemical prophylaxis lasts long take agent.

The quoted papers demonstrate vitro activity, substitute actual clinical data. also cannot compared across 2 separate viral strains (“79% genetic similarity”?).

The guy wrote article particularly scientifically literate yet trumpeting papers barely understood sort gotcha moment. even American live side continent. would love same. also hope politicians across world let people needlessly die due COVID-19 suffer nightmares every night. sending kids Los Angeles San Diego school districts announced campuses reopen next month, **Orange County's Board Education recommending students return classrooms without masks social distancing requirements.** collapse lack leadership top. 

Cities losing money, complained governors. State government can't anything without federal aid, getting. 

If Federal government prioritizing giving money states people corporations, shutdowns may worked. want states declare bankruptcy force restructure want. fucking stupid Americans?! Holy shit. mean knew.

I'm fortunate travel world thanks profession. And, whenever travel overseas, foreigners always made fun government. can't wait start traveling part mockery whole fucking world! I'm arguing shut EVERYTHING. reasonable. also assumes unemployment system actually worked, us work still would spending money got right back FL groceries, rent, etc. get fully never complete shutdown begin with. think come point world either power globally lock goes away, neither really practical. treatment it. virus rampages years, immunity lasts months, never get vaccine, hospitals get overrun, workers get chronic fatigue, markets probably crash, might even spark wars famines. We're enough trouble areas world enough children born thus enough workforce take care elderly, enough people disabled they'd need care have.

But really think get that. think R number drop low enough global social distancing, countries (like US) get barred entry globally get virus control, probably get treatment later moderately effective vaccine help stomp rest fires. Probably year point. Spanish flu killed 50m people got it, COVID probably match exceed end. we’re seeing summer considered slow, can’t imagine winter version fast look like. already 100k dead country protests broke out. safe say guys fucked way protests riots. Vote out. can’t, guess Floridians want... Personally, think need get scientists politics.  can’t know sure body respond. ways, people weaker immune systems (like children) may advantage. 

I agree don’t think herd immunity possible. that’s due speed mutations evidence indicates immunity doesn’t last long. arguing theoretically herd immunity advantages conquering occurred many, many generations. wasn’t one round people getting virus, generations people getting exposed surviving descendants distinct advantage populations never exposed. country literally welding doors windows shut stop residents leaving homes block flats found infected people.

His probably serious. Smugness like DeSantis showing?

Before making comment called DeSantis' smugness want call redditor? 🤦‍♂️ become doctor? lawyer? shit ain’t easy. 2018 influenza.. unusual ICU beds fill Smallpox considered ""eradicated"", whatever percentage is, good enough.

Childcare open we're largely unionized, underpaid (meaning safety net nest egg refuse go work), viewed disposable. schools first closed asked centers state take children make schools closed. Even though early childhood educators rarely health benefits paid sick leave, make substantially less teachers. got entirely thrown bus situation.

Even knowing schools remaining closed put burden childcare sector, absolutely think schools reopen. short-sighted solution land us even worse situation. everything stayed locked everyone taken shit seriously worn masks 3 months ago now, could reopening relative safety. happen reopening set us back make shit show last longer.

The point I'm trying make childcare professionals, teachers, parents opposing teams!! banding together! demanding tax dollars used pay us stay fuck home stay safe! can't understand we're chomping bit send teachers morgue, save economy nothing exploit us.

I know NY bunch protesting done better since end May. Maybe that's case elsewhere. $600 bonus payment *once per week*, alone cover rent, some, every single American. living paycheck paycheck, paying $1200+ per month rent incredibly irresponsible. 95% cities U.S. cheaper that.

If getting $2400 per month PLUS one-time $1,200 check PLUS standard unemployment, people able save money last several months. seatbelt laws unconstitutional? work education, tell plans sorts discussed since April May. reason seem like making effort picture would dealing August/September always unclear.

Is Florida bad well waiting second, inevitable wave? can't realistically make final decision 3-4 weeks out. general optimism hope would valley cases thought would switch online sometime school year virus flared again. Except seems unwilling mandate anything. People still come state without kind protective measures place, do. Visitors go places Colorado without mask. county mandated masks rarely see except inside grocery store, even 100%. I'm pleased Polis believes science taking seriously, he's good overall, I'm frustrated lack strong reaction latest surge. average age church-goer 40+. 

They also ones wearing masks Oregon. understand feel invulnerable. Says baby wants force everyone homes people getting sick stay I'll go live life  late.

Maybe Jacksonville, Pensacola Gainesville. places I'm sure of, I'd honestly bet money people wearing masks choose outnumbered. panhandle garbage people get trapped like innocent widdle sea turtles. ;-;

I'm glad places taking seriously, though. true.

I acknowledge holiday probably temporary significant part delay still consider super unacceptable basically useless contact tracing.


As recently month ago testing pretty great lots availability generally next day results. We've gone wrong way testing apparently that's happening nationwide right now. expect people saying cup coffee excuses wear mask? Like people offices day? cup coffee going touted kryptonite mask requirements? get ambushed cup coffee?  remember that. know Trump worst actually encouraged gave benefit doubt. Got optimistic told partner it. Jeez - feel stupid snowed like think inaccurate. Cuomo appear made decisions led extra deaths Florida's death numbers lower. BUT. Florida also wrong. work you’re driving state without stopping? Would pulled over? stay family one night keep driving through, Would fined? I'd agree wholeheartedly west say shit homeland. Sometimes take information sides grain salt. ""No cure ever"" implies sure pope take dump? vaccine companies taking account? People head distance learning equivalent going school. never be, period. Crybaby terrible blow family. certainly gives one pause think many healthcare practitioners lost health lives pandemic. say hope economic dominance unshakeable believe, tenuous fear. like people dying? Quirky Yes. Though 14-day quarantine still applies, everyone's well being. Clickbait. True Worst case virus mutates kills everyone infected. remarkable many stupid F'ing people country. mind blowing. Let’s forget government Florida hiding COVID-19 cases quite time. didn’t protect educate people back April they’re screwed.

Stay safe everyone... well course not, gonna hold safe states hostage help ""swing states"" re-elections congress presidency. wonder Corona beer going ironic college parties keeping propped up.  AZ full blown crisis many people still wearing mask. Malaysia something similar. apartment complex lot community transmission, put barbed wire barricade around one entrance. looks like Auswich, really works. honestly care less happens anti-maskers, problem they're going keep spreading virus, could end killing people dumbass. 

Plus, I'd like economy get better. I'm watching countries begin re-open actual leadership government respectful citizens took pandemic seriously. US, see people stomping feet throwing tantrums asked wear mask. claim patriot. deficit June, 2020 US record whopping $864,000,000,000, beating previous record May, 2020. federal government taken serious aggressive measures early on, could spending fraction month (and still spending billions) stay top outbreaks, test everyone country, provide needed services. economy would much better, thousands lives would saved. Yes ... sense figures heading toward eventual 100% infection, point things ""stabilize.""

Sort like Anakin Skywalker brought ""balance"" Force, killing every Jedi could find, two Jedi two Sith left alive.

You know... ""stabilized"" it. arrogant fool. he's starting abyss, even stones require masks. anyone remind many school age children seriously ill covid? Schools like daycare centres working parents. That's reason everyone wants open. wear certain bike trails riding cuts beach city people go pretend like it’s summer 2019.

Just bike quick possible appreciate learning stuff. Thumbs up. going bankrupt spending $2 million testing system?

Tax income gets funneled/awarded contractors relationships local government. common corruption happens everywhere. 

Local public services (like school districts) get bare minimum function on, majority money goes towards vanity projects beautify area &amp; keep property values high. rich folks here, matter public schools function, kids go schools.

The school district budget, governed school board. ~5-10 board members locally elected direct control money spent, select president (who control). often, choose president happens constantly select projects enrich school board members.

The scam works funding projects first, making salary student support services barely fit remainder budget. Inevitably, scam projects overrun costs, causes budget claim can't pay employees need reduce salary (usually salary, letting teachers go reducing benefits way done).

Then following year, salary budget reduced, allows scam projects funded. runs original estimate process repeats. Eventually end lots frivolous projects exceed budget district can't stay financially solvent anymore. request emergency funds county/state/etc, emergency funds arrive they're insolvent claim bankruptcy break contracts.

So contracts think president suggested break first? Expensive school board member related projects nothing education, teachers &amp; staff contracts? Right now, faculty union voting whether accept 25% salary reduction mass layoffs.  ... definitely aren’t downtown. It’s problem 20-40 year olds especially. I’ve said something multiple people always bullshit excuse: it’s hot; I’m apartment; outside (but even attempting social distance); *I’m even sick*

I’m getting ready make shirts says ‘inconvenient mask now, life-long health problems later?’ bare minimum required American pastime. enjoyment get businesses thst go massive debt never return. People lose livelihood. Glad get jollies that. think tanks like human equivalent doctors testify court either defense prosecution giving person question mental health diagnosis even though they’ve never actually done assessment person. It’s using credentials mislead people think words mean actually public believes don’t know better I'd curious know ""they"" keep track who's wearing mask. probably ask expert, like fast-food employee. gotta go hand tinfoil hat wearers ammunition like this.... ramp staff city code enforcement office double fines, need riot forces neighborhood parks  still true? teens work anymore, partly they're busy (see decline delinquency) part reason living wages important. Adults hold jobs now, dependents, even take care themselves. downplay good results close schools early, contact tracking certain areas advised travel outside prefecture. people complied. lot confusion schools would reopen. all, they’re much better US, doubt.

Edit- Source friend japanese husband vice-principal one largest high schools prefecture. stressed all.. Early phase trial reporting small sample healthy 18-55 year olds. Suggests vaccine could effective reasonably safe part population. Still long ways go determine long immunity last they’re still waiting results older people enrolled study. Larger studies coming, assume. That's actually pretty high mortality rate considering infectious virus is, also assumes hospitals never get capacity, already hitting states intense. Monday bad, rest week truly horrible. Sounds great except would send bunch kids already stretched thin foster care system. politicians? agreed celebrities promoting mask usage! Ahh yes, ol' legality determines morality clause.

If need rules force right thing, fucking piece shit, full stop. military budgets federal source spending. federal government could spend dept. education chose that, idea local governments. Yes did, think: No, idiot. one saying people plan better deal school closings. people work, households require adults contribute. Tough handcuffed child day everyday required play teacher. It’s funny blame Governor like showed house Lake Tahoe made people wear masks. long run might cheaper testing &amp; homeless/poor people can't pay hospital bills government may make mostly free affordable.

Yes and? I'm bored reasoning circles something pointless. end day agree practical notion wear damn mask. touche. Outdoor activities reduce spread. 

I think know getting at, that's odd way phrase it. Also, think really accurate, states shut non-outdoorsy methods entertainment (bars, concerts, sporting events, etc.), still got hammered anyways. mean get nearly daily basis County around 830,000 people I'm pretty happy that. can't imagine new case County Country! I'd leaping moon. 200k... definitely possibility.  last month, deaths per week 4000 6000, averaging close 5000 per week whole month.  Given 135k so, makes sense think losing 20k month get us 200k November good bit.  

300k stretch unless numbers dead go up.  interesting watching deaths largely come down, even cases going up.  hard say trend last, huge explosion recent cases finally start taking death toll again.  

Remember mid April losing 16.5k per week two worst weeks.  

The prospect schools opening business usual fashion pretty alarming. Statistically, wearing mask education urban area caring others. may even opposite suggested - people cities, reputation caring less others, likely wear masks, friendly people rural areas less likely.

Also people US friendly compared Asia. grew Korea visit Japan often. Japanese Korean people sometimes even fearful/reluctant help strangers, America I've found people often leap aid. New York city 40% positive time though far far cases reported.

I’m also calling bullshit mild symptoms, even mild asymptomatic people scarring lungs. Even long term effects COVID get pneumonia frequently, that’s still shitty, I’d rather avoid can.

Also, I’m talking asymptomatic spread. I’m talking fucking idiots think nonsense—which makes pretty decent portion population Texas—being reason spreading, reason nervous since surrounded idiots. Also, seeing toll takes people *do* live active lives necessary health things healthy immune system first hand makes want absolutely nothing virus help it.

Also, work warehouse construction supplies. specifically, it’s plumbing supplies. spend 8 hours day lifting pipe, water heaters, tubs, sorts heavy shit. good health be. Even that, *and* vitamins supplements take, *AND* wearing mask (because effective stopping spread virus) still don’t feel safe stupid fucking idiots live hotbed virus think fucking hoax. horrible knob destroying lungs planet.

Therefore, infection numbers see _today_ actually week old death count see today actually closer _month_ old; spike deaths usually lags behind spike infections 2-3 weeks.

Also, hospitals get overwhelmed reported covid deaths peak. People dying directly due covid home might go uncounted. Peoply dying due unknown causes would covid go uncounted there's capacity test dead. People dying due non-covid illnesses require hospital attention can't bed go uncounted.

However, winter see another repeat 2020 April NYC, time panic. That's unlikely though, NYC widely speculated reached herd immunity threshold, 25% population antibodies blood. 

This may due part called mucosal cell immunity, due part graph like nature social circles.

BS story get hook breaking law using privilege break rules Yeah I’m trying piss anyone ruin day silly disagreement reddit. would hate piss someone turn around take someone else. There’s certainly enough anger hatred world already! Take easy nice day. went Walmart today, people saw mask, covering nose around chin neck. Many people seem wear primarily entry, could give fuck inside whatever establishment. dare public health doctor tell us actual facts data!! Doesn’t know job lie make Trump look good possible wins re-election??!  waaht?   Nah, didn’t read incorrectly. says “death toll exceeds...*making* (it) severe.” word “making” implies death toll indicates “severe” is. it’s still literally untrue. Spanish flu started America.  agree think things fauci could better confirming giving credibility needed proactive timely manner. Reading random things news explanations get latest info discouraging. CDC fauci seem slow here. Maybe like “data” fauci could stop adjectives speak directly stuff. 

He seems one first say stuff proven/have enough info updates side effects ideas long term complications? could speak may side effect idea certain looking , may heard could possibility it’s 3 instances....etc. 

As physician position good talk side effects still well understood (covid-19 novel disease all). important thing limit spread wait focus side effects know probably late. New York first responders 9/11. knew would side effects people going time first study save people people need saving already definitely played politics mask early on. Hard forgive good amount people won’t wear since keep hearing conflicted things.

Early contradicting studies concerning masks advocating social distancing vs wearing mask probably saved way lives think. people know wear n95 mask (and ones recommended stop virus time) saying buy n95 mask would deffinatly bad time. lot research masks work normal cotton masks could one best ways curb infection rates (look Asian countries wearing mask normalized population long time ago).

The fact matter people look physician's work things bad, work mostly prevent things going bad.

Also mention thing article said - critique Fauci context words months ago today's knolage. Hindsight 20/20 say. bury fucking head sand mean mountains evidence piling up. Read fucking book, halfwit. totally is, F downvoters mom keeps complaining leaving mass spectrometer kitchen worktop. Re-infections starting pop presenting worse first time (see, e.g., two recent cases described last TWIV (This week Virology) episode). Neutralizing antibodies seem fall pretty quickly 50 days. 
So, earliest people infected March/April -- lucky enough get tested therefore confirmed re-infection cases-- going start reinfected potentially remaining antibodies less helpful.

COVID-19 exactly issues. “official recorded” number 550,000ish. plenty deaths that, statisticians delve numbers, reasonable suspicion actual deaths already number 700,000, 1,000,000 maybe even more, depending believe figures interpreted.

There hundreds upon hundreds visitors small amount time park.

 whole thing actually bummed us out. feel safe enough enjoy many areas fact people cared personal enjoyment nothing else.

I even mention lackadaisically Ravalli County (my county) taking things. Stay safe 406 guy incompetent trump getting thousands Floridians killed speak. Keyword: _amid_. stop reacting actually try stop spread :/ ... severe yet ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° 200% agree. Live Tulsa (born raised nyc) worked 2 min trump rally. fully agree statement trump land confirm. Canada shut got phase 1 like every 1st world nation it. otherwise he's realistic, reason hopped bs train still it.

actively working convincing stats articles. Lordy, thermonuclear-level stupidity. first guy saying thinks masks public negative psychological impact people can't see smile.

I talking friend/coworker last friday, masked distance, thinking midway conversation, nice smile. could see eyes... still see smiles fucking mask ffs. Looks around houston, yeah ok. way, seasonal flu kills 200,000 600,000 people worldwide every year, depending bad season is.

A days official (underestimated) covid death toll exceeded higher end flu death toll. Justaflubros already started making higher flu death tolls thin air, course. I'm saying there's reason go CNC manual, can't think one right now. you? Hows incivil? think he's saying numbers matter. Classic ""1 death tragedy, million statistic"" kind line read mind would require ability experience remorse. Let's talk this: people ordered stay home wear masks?

Why given choice? Speaking outsider, albeit one states many times somehow citizenship, Florida seems embody dumbest aspects American culture take next level. Especially dumb government (and say people?) nation dumb governments. I’d probably leave too, dealing morons life rot brain. article 

In addition, 27% people Covid experience loss smell taste, loss tend complete nearly complete, partial, person experience loss smell/taste odds high indeed Covid overlaps rarely respiratory illnesses (odds ten one according one research) always meant people. time people would shoot arm leg get insurance payout.

But they're happy die bet lot people voted Trump reason appreciate politician able larger scale.

Florida set record both! open schools! Let’s make masks required! Etc Nah, putting bunch skittles toilet flushing better description Helluva thing expect. expect p.o.s reelected continue incompetence, Florida.... whole country done things properly, like 2-3 months max. 

The Disneyland Shanghai closed end January reopened April. operating problems far. lower norm! average cost community college $5k  Title accurate. County Board voted ALLOW school districts reopen without requiring masks distancing. School districts themseleves still choose reopen, enforce distancing masks.

It's good decision county board, mean think means. Read article. WWII grandparents would appalled us.

Bummer many people disregarding yet another excuse talk much they've lost faith humanity. looks like Douglas Reynholm Different economies. middle ages survived became valuable commodity even farmer could make much moneys before. modern economy would import poor people abroad needed unskilled workers, skilled workers probably many businesses would go bust badly hit economy would still skilled people around jobs require skills. answer questions:

Uh, anti-maskers claim masks literally killing people. Good fuck Aggies. It’s harder right might think. I’ve trying find job another country backup plan since mid-March lot countries’ borders closed right even skilled workers employer willing sponsor them. Taiwan towards top list one reason, they’re closed. Singapore’s also near top, they’re giving authorization enter country except small number conditions, e.g. you’re married Singaporean citizen. looked Australia too, they’re closed well. sure South Korea, pretty sure New Zealand’s closed. think UK might open, they’ve done even worse US deaths per capita (but maybe better now?). I’ve heard Japan still open well. Canada used look US. asked practically Canadian would rather be, US wouldn’t answer.

There probably higher rate Americans wanting move Canada now. used opposite thing fail realize ""rights"" come certain amount social responsibility. True, need trust people actually developing ethical. Every investment gets checked pushed people overseeing it. extra layer top business usual drug developments. point lucky jail al gets. leader, somewhere, going end like Mussolini genociding state/country. deaths haven’t even started yet. exactly manufacturing? get ready go great all, there's dozens promising vaccines various stages. manufacture?

If going make promise can't keep, first need figure fool people believing promise. Basics deceit. Nancy Pelosi worth $120m career politician? Curious kind death rate would needed people would get clue. Like killing 10% instead &lt;1%, would fools start wearing masks? 50%? point you’d think they’d cave absurd principles reality smacks face watch family friends die. then, wouldn’t question masks work worn. relatively low death rate emboldening fools? cure stupid. know get COVID once?

Edit words People *dying.* They’re afraid get tested. aren’t seeking treatment. keep hearing we’re going make “incremental progress” see *dead people shouldn’t dead.* 

I’m asking things perfect, “people continue spread virus die they’re poor” isn’t even *good!* feel like I’ve gone totally nuts, fellow Americans willing argue acceptable?! True, lowest Monday while. case curve looks (finally) plateaued out, death toll too, bet little growth peaks. think they're hump. Kern actually removed list; Newsom tweeted follow-up. Tax sure. watch people move similar happening California. I'm willing give paycheck government trust right thing. Closed back now. “Queensland close borders midday Tuesday residents 77 Sydney suburbs Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk declared coronavirus hot spots” take people get mask, wait 3 weeks get one amazon even demand much higher could released? hear you. great options here. 

There might options don’t require people die order keep small businesses solvent, though. 

There’s another issue small businesses open. enough people concerned virus can’t really recover economy effectively controlled anyway. Even things reopened, people aren’t going back, there’s still virus there, less income spend small businesses, big ones. small businesses financial concern whether open closed. fact, several business owner friends mine lost money reopened, staff place one wanted go, risk. 

We recover economy spending power consumers within getting virus control, which, seen nearly countries gotten least approached side curve, may require closing things while. 

Just like schools, good answer. lot really imperfect ones trade offs. consumers choice potential death v supporting mom pop street, they’re choosing potential death, problem whether places closed. 

That doesn’t mean like small businesses closing, relish it. means reality moment doesn’t give us lot great options, prefer one less people die COVID.

So governor ordering wear mask self incarcerate illegal. Many state supreme courts confirmed this.

Meaning system going endangered minor losses way. also shut system fully partially, save lives, long term detrimental impact system harder longer goes on. cause less immediate loss life, cost lives lower living standards. whole, going pay significant monetary humanitarian price matter do. real choice choosing divvy bill. need protest.

The federal government every elected politician level let happen us, 130,000+ deaths thier hands.

How going held accountable american people? “The commentary angered anti-mask advocates, accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask.”

These people doomed. DeSantis power, don’t keep hopes :-/ Or...they could show up. *precisely* unions born, precisely needed.

If teachers show up, Texas going do? Fire all? Hire scabs across border?

Collective Bargaining, people. Illegal unionize? I'm gonna use argument many Texans love use regards 2nd Amendment:

*When tell can't have* *~~guns~~* *unions, that's exactly need them.* Florida man solid Spam till believe. alternative students then? Delay education goals year? That's I'm trying figure out. half people catch virus I'm staying home till gone. poll result ready. would 100% remaining percentage didn’t invested interests south — family greedy reasons. Crazy.

Imagine living wanting border open? Feel free go you’re inclined! Someone work caught spread noticed. would like nominate Daniel Andrews, Premier Victoria, Australia category! ridiculous deal selfish people are. I'm wishing best luck times. Hopefully come top sooner later. Austria done exactly success, still nowhere near normality. Nah, trying beat dad's zodiac body count. exactly social circle infected? plus 7 others? Strange. I’d WW2-style Coronavirus Containment Corps along border. 

A million Canadian soldiers ought plenty. Except food poisoning risk catching contagious disease different scenarios.

They may technically get decide seriously think megcorp army lawyers extensive research statements legal implications.

They write woke suddenly decided take responsibility. wrote institution indeed held responsible customers voluntarily show catching disease. British data report death rates hospitalised patients dropped 1/4 April, 6% 1.5%. believe death numbers relatively low hospitals run beds, starting happen several states. surge beds prepared extra staff far know, staff stretched thin, hospital mortality rise again, people unable get hospitals, death numbers spike again. ironic? find terrifying. sidebar subreddit full regional subreddits see largely immobile, exist. Would easier everything that's symptom gets listed lol isn’t symptom? mean CDC ? Michael Mouse  like news headline reporting pandemic. impossible know actually bad not, pick stats report generate headlines. 

It's like 150 days, really need look day day changes? look long term trends pandemic actually heading? far looking predict 1 week ahead, following day day. funding comes county taxes Dude left leaning page cant bash BLM protests, worth it, arent gonna win  Expect tomorrow deceptively low.

Deaths climbing Fl Government won’t change thing. Flatten curve something don’t hear much anymore [Link here] realise existed US, funding come ? 20% pay ? May well create NHS. Welcome Trump University.  already 4%, officially. Trump able shut last week campaign final anti-trade commercials strong areas lost lot manufacturing jobs. remember 538 Trump winning EC losing popular vote 25% way big comfortable with. 

Hundreds thousands dead trillions pissed away. votes matter, unfortunately. ""Other"" = hippies, blacks, jews, women pants, gays etc. full-blooded aryan murcans. Martial law would scary crazy type militias would probably trying start civil war. seem very, smart people. I'm going downvoted this.

Less 3000 people 40 died covid.. 25 150. bet ppl severe underlying conditions convid. doomers ridiculous. many young people going long lives ruined shutting economy?? 80%? sacrificing entire generation save 80 year olds. Shame ridiculous paper chose image instead one showing plane .

A typical trick media take heat politicians since people see image judge incident cover picture. advertise county hospitals lose shit ton money giving free healthcare citizens . don’t get paying customers, system collapses.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* EEOC already stated Covid satisfies criteria putting employees customers risk therefore business required allow people disabilities without mask. lawsuit go anywhere substantive. bet state forced close, insurance would pay out. close voluntarily, get nothing.

They played chicken governor, expecting give shit. *Plenty sunshine getting vitamin D, think ever happen me*

/s 0% trust anything comes Russia. WTF wrong US?

How much time have? I'm sure made comprehensive list, reading aloud would take day. Apparently given exclusively Putin's political enemies Russian journalists first. detection rates treatments gotten much better past months. can't compare directly NY numbers. Also demographics infected need considered. good portion new infections young health people far less likely die. I'm expecting places like Florida case death ratio anywhere near high NY. Vulnerable people gotten message point, wearing mask going bars restaurants. Also seniors homes many high death counts come still high alert many measures place.

The death rates climb likely reporting. can't assume death counts based case counts alone. national polls Clinton +3% +4% 'lost' +2%, well within polls' margins error. 

When Trump people see Rasmussen(a Republican leaning pollster) showing Biden 10 points 50-40 shitting pants. Unknowns late deciders usually cut incumbent basically one electorate mind made Trump. Since Trump people see 2016 magical pony type election, think able create magical pony every time. 

Trump remains strong states white, old uneducated. Everywhere else he's toast. Exactly.

SARS-1 basically inexistent, never came back, MERS infected 2500 people last 8 years.

So never great reason research intensively. American, truly hope really knocks sense dense portion population. However fellow Americans never ceased amaze truly stupid are, I’m holding breath. Land free, home fucking stupid. wearing mask screenwriter likeness? severe *yet* must severe case moronavirus, Movid-19 Americans Brazil least...fml become common place I’m surprised didn’t hear “full time!”

Translation: want everyone go back work, don’t give shit kids learning Yeah, why? Well, reasonable ones among us trying -- there's substantial number American population care, thinks hoax, refuses wear mask ""muh rights"". lot people going die that. also subset completely insane people think virus hoax. Don’t know got idea supreme leader what. Americans (people would consider completely rational otherwise) decided going back normal lives regardless: parties, churches, manicures...you name it. It’s bad combination. least they're entirely stupid... agree. :) What's pay? need new job since government shutdowns obliterated industry livelihood. Hello neighbor. Cases 307 yet updated weekend. update weekend jump three days update them. (should later 7 days since July 4th time enough new cases start showing think expect big jump.

But yeah El Dorado county lot anti-maskers. new shutdown, I'm hoping stores start asking/requiring people wear masks door. I'm looking Walmart Home Depot. Last Post Office Placerville even sign saying masks required. virus burned NYC moved places. jesus fucking chirst, average person asthma doesnt die flu. covid respiratory illness UV light helps destroy virus moves sitting surfaces. outdoors greater airflow, meaning breathing condensed atmosphere everyone inside restaurant past half-hour. There's much transmission strictly far away someone are. Outdoors versus indoors significant effect spread. study outbreaks China managed identify single outbreak 318 analyzed outdoor contact. symptomatic lucky enough get test. Surprised negative. research read today there's 30% false negative rate. could still it. percentage negative tests could actually positive. I'm sure 1% factors considered Trump winning? honest, taught something mad America-centric, myopic worldview sustained en masse anymore. That's really good idea. Enforce Masks. Shut back down. real stimulus packages right . option endless death counts arent even first responders retrieve bodies.

This fucking joke. depends personal risk tolerance. You’re customer facing position risk contracting virus (depending prevalent virus area) fairly high. job opportunities safer I’d say go instead. really, math what’s worth not. Consider whether you’re risk group (how old you? comorbidities?)  crazy anytime anyone points tourism biggest industry FL comment downvoted. get triaged like basically fucked, give morphine shit least right? remember keep denying us M4A.


Please vote. TTI antibody tests, usually (Italy special case). Nordics, TTI identifying active cases using PCR. 

I've always dystopian idea ""immunity passports"" Sweden dipping toe use antibody tests. calling that, baby toe still tiny step direction teh whole ""if antibodies, visit grandma thing"". irresponsible given state technology, lack knowledge immunity works, possibility lab error. Yeah you’re right :( without preservation/knowledge art would never reach many people. Damn trying little optimistic minute! would hope not, we've really done much less country. We've even done tests total anyone. could say we're ones really handling countries ignoring thousands cases. one really knows. living three different counties varying shades red blue, gerrymandering alone incredible hill I’m optimistic summited without legislation enabling fair representation. 

But fuck cool happens. break day bit more? find helped instead focusing don’t —office socialization/commute break up, etc.… focus have: time day spend family, call someone care about, throw load wash used scramble get done weekends…Today example went hour long hike middle day, answering emails phone went, came back cleaned house, made healthy lunch kitchen instead buying crappy food packing schlepping lunch… Maybe find ways creative find gratitude. 
Side note: also think switching location something could never before. boyfriend considering driving someplace else two months winter getting Airbnb which, first day disinfecting like crazy pretty comfortable. options never before—you think outside box. Wishing well! like Galileo Galilei vs ruling Clergy again. real going alone eating, drinking, parking within 3 miles park? point testing capacity maxxed out? states shut appropriately flattened curve. states barely acted global pandemic cases spreading I'm not. Name-calling absolutely get result want. kind behavior makes leaders lose credibility.  Perhaps COVID-19 find leader free world escort swiftly meet sweet Jesus? would truly unfortunate. 😢 

😏 Nancy Pelosi prays every night... Could president entire Republican Party flaw system? absolutely made clear. Trump reason complete failure. normal, competent administration, would fine. don’t think solution going work. Half people can’t go back work. going provide childcare stipend? immune response yes. mention evidence virus actually attacking B cells integral future immunity. Like magic predetermined B antigen almost anything could get. Even viruses variations exist yet one know possible like say body magical. destroying component cells course going long term effects. bright side seeing COVID-19 related cells bode well long term immunity. Also seeing cases people developing Diabetes 1 remainder life virus beta cells. also suspect that's mean insulin sensitivity.

I agree many long term complications virus critical cells disastrous effects vital organs way actually changes brain patients. Glad could agree something :-) HeAt LiGhT That's new interesting take. agree principal frankly say let's see goes. Maybe right. 

What's next step bubble proves mostly effective? thought originally would behave like influenza pandemic. looking less less like seems behave like regular coronavirus, circulate seasonally. Yeah... that's happens diet mcdonalds doritos. Pants remain.... optional. truth! Good point play catch up? need get mentality stop promoting kids based age. isn’t race. Kids need assessed eduction restart 2021 based need academically, age. I'm disappointed expected Rick roll. know popular opinion sub, fully agree! Kids gonna joining *gangs* place like L.A online learning continues!

(And no, giving free Chromebooks internet gonna work. Santa Clara (I think) tried that, even then, 40% participate!) Everybody infected, stable Satisfying might be, think root cause noncompliance persistence ""just flatten curve overflow hospitals"".  Continually declining case counts possibility evidenced rest world. progressive Polis been, feel like set bar low R0=1 goal. Name-calling galvanize freedom fighters. aggressive goal needs expressed reach rational non-compliant people. still sentinel testing US? Cuomo issued mandate requires visitors certain states register contact info upon entry face $2k fine summons mandatory quarantine. Polis take notes Cuomo. wrong things

Jesus, let's ignore many times Trump wrong, outright lied, things. Easter, gone summer, anyone wants test get test, etc. That's thing. one really knows end. masks help? say will, say wont. contract twice? Again, say yes, say no. one really knows enough this. people think America bad we're careless, think we've done tests anyone, sides could equally right.  That's one reason - but: thing nearly English-speaking nations, also traditional breads there, tend sweat. Canada South Africa, call bread, either cake (e.g. honey sweatened crumbly bread) kind sweet toast sandwich slices.

Breads like continental Europe, contain amount sugar left fermentation added sugar starter yeast) common nations also. looking nutritional value tables, yeah, US bread seems even much sweeter those, also seems contain huge amounts corn syrup often, something seen bread anywhere else.   wait years vaccine, economy going completely ruined amount extra lives saved justify (~20% reduction potential deaths guess).

All measures delaying inevitable. virus out, millions going die thing stop happening vaccine.

The value human life infinite, draw line somewhere benefit society whole. makes mad, direct anger towards China vote politicians cut ties them. state shut months controlled virus grandmother wears mask walking dog several miles 90 degree heat. handle champ, believe you. Cursing now, we?

Yeah, *that's* really going convince folks.... Somehow country fucked unplugging plugging back .  see posturing data. Truth dehumanizing fellow humans psychological conditioning occurs rise ladder corporatism. numbers analytically speaking deaths altered lives Americans acceptable stabilize system interest corporation state.. see public opinion fraction influence governments agenda. listen corporations becos end day politicians thru contributions campaigning. Instead hidden plain sight see decisions making happening real time. POTUS could reign direct product system see placing lives danger profits. short hot revolution complain unless make feel sense touchable... ignore us turn screws us make lives living hell.. Knowing Disney, doubt they're charging extra enter ""mask-free"" relaxation zones. effort looks everyone Hate man, guy. totally works.. die bullet instead COVID avoid becoming COVID statistic Glad are. fun folks there. Thanks, best wishes well. Spanish Flu Pandemic, first wave began spring 1918 almost disappeared summer. fall came roaring back. believe deaths took place then. lingered 1920, killing estimated 650,000 Americans. 

Whether Covid things remains seen. Erm, no. SARS1. Maybe SARS2 different enough won’t happen? Ok. Fine stopped people Jersey people jersey weren’t coming RI. you’re right RI shouldn’t stopped people NY coming made quarantine we’re coming high risk state guess NY definitely stop people coming high risk states know, stuff. Google excess deaths. Deaths reported saying go

*Think stupid average person is, realise 50% people dumber that*

It's amazing human race gotten far really. Yikes, seriously? I'm *from* PA, expected better Wolf Levine, who've handling well far.

If play (and want pessimist downer, hope safety), please, please safe possible. I'm originally Iowa, currently live Colorado. went back visit family (We quarantined) limited basis somewhere around May. absolutely shocked full stores were, one keeping distance, one wearing mask.

It complete culture shock.

Same deal, went back late June, even sad. can't say live, saw two solid nights 4th July weekend parties 50 60 people... Yelling, drinking, generally way freaking close other. 

We considered moving back cost living, really hard leave kind leadership here. Hate guy, man. fair, left wanted stay close and/or mandate masks. push back coming right, led dumbass governor. Yup- husband early 20's 2008. Lost first house, lost jobs- fun stuff. Took 4 years finally able find stable enough employment find place instead crashing relatives couches. 

I went back college could get part time $12 hour job. Finished graduate degree accounting make $13 hour part time spouse laid again.. 

lol

The whole thing one ginormous joke. extends orders spite them? response childish. Two weeks... that's wishful thinking. shit know needed laugh day Manager small restaurant Michigan here, enforced mask rule go effect, I'm looking forward telling regulars need mask up.
My crowd exactly type follow rules. like potential lost business, plan stay safe myself.
Not worth I'm making.
At all.  Sooooooooo...my road trip Vegas LA area weeks probably going suck? Thank fellow gamer. comment gave good smile thinking hell earth still come virus continues ravage states. 

Time Troubles indeed. Sorry no. brother 40 sister couple years younger that. couldn’t different way raised world was. references things I’ve ever able see movies using technology outdated even little kid me. grew google YouTube, don’t remember 9/11 economic recession. social media accounts years even old enough ‘legally’ sign up. spent school years snapchatting class posting cringiest stuff online that’s still today. upbringing follows much closer cousins born 2007 2009 much pains say. 

So no. We’re part generation. 

Also, Strauss-Howe generational theory roots american history society (I’m American), well it’s criticised reading pseudoscience astrology honestly agree scanning article. fuck id sock em there. hell work? athletes participating experiment whose results beneficial all.

If restart season, things go well inside bubble shut down, send useful message rest country: Even healthy millionaires access best medical care spared expense create bubble able contain spread, normal folk able either.

Cancelling season without trying start able send message. allow deniers keep believing things would fine tried start. news, water wet. think parks probably way safe crowded bars, that’s setting bar high. Best luck know anyone gone Florida. main concern (for myself, I’m obviously concerned anyone’s death). I’m young healthy. I’d rather young unhealthy. I'm 22 parents want out. choice. press release/propaganda specifically designed make US look bad.

Nah, US Yes, know. Yes, blame themselves. Now, talking extreme scenario government force feeding 3k calorie diet, sure blame government.

However, case right now, ever see becoming way, fact feeling obesity start decrease America coming decades. actual source back prediction, feel like explaining right either. point still stands though. pinnacle health here. still vices eat fast food would care admit, yet taking weight gainer protein shakes attempt gain weight. cannot blame food around us point, would affecting even people like me.

It purely power will. accustomed body consume X calories daily basis. really need calories sustain weight. Guess what? count calories reach calorie intake stop day. hungry day? Absolutely. Why? body accustomed X calories calories. You. Will. Survive. body gets accustomed calories go even lower...now happens? lose weight! concept...

You even exercise lose weight. purely diet issue. exercise too? Absolutely! It'll help burn calories lessens amount to...well..lessen lol, also health mood benefits. purely diet issue solved diet. both! 2020. Thaaaaaaat's one. Yeah, people noted ""this HR person seems **unreasonably chipper** 'plan death' seminar"" County? school district school district. Hyper kocal Pennsylvania same. Let’s say verse team densely populated highly populated area Pittsburgh (this year will). chance catching virus spreading back county teams play. (We play teams West Virginia well). two different potentially become infected due 2 teams playing one 3 hour game. “Natural Selection” takes 5 seconds respond. idiot like would think haha.
Burden proof me. Unlike 99% sub, could care less anyone thinks me. Move Colorado cupcake. 50% higher death per population ratio. alone, lot us wish better options, Scene [Master Commander tells us Hold noses vote ..... Totally!
Lets stuff em warehouse, fuck right safe reasonable life want social activities... Oof 🙄 Doub'ing testing still (slightly) higher positive percentage.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ain't wrong.  hoping need immunity, gotta beat 4 people going get sick. Though sure people died protests, thinking enormous surge talking protest didnt really cause feel really bad people situation. federal government failed us suffer. UK paid everyone 2/3 pay guaranteed businesses got virus control. get go broke die. Coronavirus: Endgame rather big variation there. looking usa conducting brick wall moment, would bet cash bigger number. Still, people believe deaths worst factor fear fact people get severely sick later recover find lung scars reduce health long term, numbers way bigger deaths. Corona seems full surprises acting catalyst attacking blood vessels according latest research. people ass backwards expect? happen blame “Antifa” “thugs” whatever coded words non-white people think up, totally ignore anyone might need food. Precisely, point. Despite 10x mortality rate, left little trace collective memories - radically different psyches tolerance risk today.

Even “lockdowns” imposed, would today call “phase 3”, couple weeks. start high school bullshit happens. feel safe anymore. even place grew forced go school. becomes easyer considering legal status varys place place. dont get pulled bring people fill up. growing mushrooms en mass hard trace spore syringes psyches legal sale ""for microbioligy"". Check r/sporetraiders info find vendors. add comment, last week Tuesday - Friday like 850-950 deaths per day. 1k would unusual (or even surge, matter). Look Florida, definitely lying. article fails mention CDC last week updated IFR ""best estimate"" 0.65%, 0.3%.

If 20% US ends getting C19, 430,000 Americans could die end this. 

Then got deal unknowns ~1,000,000 Americans fell severely ill, long term, crippling disabilities now? What's cost that?

This even mentioning unknowns 36,000,000 mild moderate illness. permanent damage? effects? 

Iodonnis rather boldly advocated lockdowns without addressing unknowns, making dubious claims IFR. friend's mother tried admitted Covid symptoms today turned away friend drive Dallas. friend works hospital told learned ambulances turn away shift tonight. bad.  knew job done cuz done it. yeah real big problem would absolute nightmare start morning year 2000 crap going on. right press acted like rest us sat helplessly thumbs asses government largely done crisis.

hey normal day, can/could party next day, always remember thats arbitrary date, used this. like guy. like lot. concealed shirt open carry? shouldn’t finding solutions? Finding ways families band together help out? I’d adopt family needed dual income (or single parent). could across country, aren’t don’t actually care communities, give lip service. 

The schools *are* going shut again. encourage reach families start working feasible solution. feel like whole part thread people wanting actual sound bites discredit DeVos. couth, all? tech field still largely chugging along. seem issue warnings fact.

I see relevance Duck that! would quit find online job start YT channel teaching donations! way would put life line stupid government lazy Karens! man said shutdown WOULD happen cases continued rise? say Trump isnt Idiot? Damn hate this, one makes u eat sugar salt. Like wtf stop blaming others power. quit job, I'm sure eventually she'll find new one, mean time working anywhere else safer, even teaching friend mine can't smell anything artificial can't taste salt. way since mid-April. Ha ha that's awesome. way get buzz! Nope, wont give til we’re dead step right direction it? Sure probably persuade MAGA's may change people's minds fence mask wearing. guess I'm optimistic people. Wish could come together write name. wrote name across country instead current 2 choices, could maybe hope Littleton here. always wear N95 public. CDC numerous docs say wear one, better believe I'm gonna follow suit. We're 'tarded! 💪 FL safer Colorado. conspiratorial bent. believe numbers false virus attempt dethrone great leader. That's problem. Asymptomatic presymptomatic carriers spreading like crazy. ebola, it'd quickly almost zero deaths. People catch ebola, die quickly spreading it. COVID-19 gets spread shitload finds somebody kill injure life. Well, since defense self others, see not. Well good thing they're finish then, gentrify area! Already lol.  Herd comes herr durr I’m sorry loss cat. Hopefully friends family chat w lockdown. Wow they're fucking mind. Found one coworkers planning go Florida vacation....and he's acting like big thing.

Should quarantine 2 weeks returning work? think he's planning it....but I'm worried. HIV/AIDS pandemic? killed 38M people. read cultures alcohol prohibited common increased consumption sugar-sweetened pop/soda/soft-drinks, primary cause rising incidence obesity across age levels.

As traditional diets nutrition give way increasing consumption processed foods high added sugars, population health suffering. Explain high positive test rate thanks! Canada continent North America, Brazil continent South America. Yes, higher since, number going down. can’t phrase way transparent rather tricky? November going bad. Right we're summer, best time year get sick mess there. Come cold season going get much, much worse unless people smarten up. 

My guess destabilizing tactic declare martial law cancel next election thinks he's going lose. I'm sure prefer idea sociopaths megalomaniacal morons charge reason covid bad 'progressive' countries, they're acting alone either way terrifying.

I really worry US. know many lovely people live there. wish selfish people loud visible many trying what's best everyone. lot studies show decreased mortality well number beneficial effects. decide ignore them? Especially schools open kids spread virus like wildfire. Tweet deleted. lot SoCal, thought. always remembered starting school late August. favorite conversations Romanian, Russian Asian friends use hang ranted Stupid Americans! laughed knowing true become evident! OC team Los Angeles Angels Anaheim, surprise there. matter time countries see problems USA did. US hub transmission due hub commerce etc. tip spear least means got sooner.  sorry, wasnt nappropriate thing say, struck close home , literally bitchslap dad cut insane concpiracy theory rant ant make understand wearing mask case way optional, mom cancer surviver. Australia comfortable riding R0 1 little thought. winter hit we've hit 6 shit. really lucky 6 months prepare nobody expected go community spread 300 cases day week.

It really going race clock vaccine northern hemisphere winter. lucky first wave hit end winter, 5-6 month spell inside weather going hard contain. Last summers pretty pest-free. It’s dry. Yeah. I’m shocking get people wear masks. title cringe. 

It could’ve easily worded as: “new case numbers decreasing”. 

But say say it’s highest number yet, since last week high. Verbal gymnastics 🙄 can't...then wear face shield Recommend retires. tenure, can't shit, pay her. even testing contract tracing right, makes people believe they'll navigate mass production, logistics distribution vaccine 300+ million people early 2021? SAD Orange County filled brim ignorant, entitled, selfish, rich people. Think worst people like hollywood, place nicest area California, make Republicans thats get dumbass decision making like this. Didnt see board supervisors meeting anti mask idiots? Let introduce absolute idiocy 'The O.C.' I’m sure Trump’s balls appreciate clear landing strip.  Fuck that, I'm wearing mask every goddam time go yard. wear mask I'm going near people protracted periods I'm going building there's way I'm wearing one every second I'm outdoors. There's fucking purpose law like that. Sím good, snitch other.

Also CZ AFAIK ranked 8th safest peaceful country world hey guess fine indeed Bingo. win. Despite fucking evidence opposite true? Yeah, what, old broken 944, eh? True pretty much everywhere. Back caveman days know like kicked people good cave murdered took stuff right.

Unless land completely empty, likely violence death original owners next group owners next owners. Exactly attempted. However, think explaining exponential spread beyond mathematical comprehension. “scientific geniuses believe conspiracy take president “Chinese Virus” “given test you”. work mental health saying delusions combated reality. truly delusional, that. P Obligatory: from? found giant flag says thrift store bought it! instance current president believe malice disguised incompetence Seems lot right wing types ""know all"" positively **terrified** that. ""Help keep healthy"" bottom link seems like ultimate irony. many things world make sense. 

A ""Do say do"" type thing. really wanted help keep healthy, would open. platitudes incredibly thin veneer. 

I'd say appropriate write ""Help keep us making profits ensure massive outbreak occurs staff here. Well, least we're forced close claim insurance."" etc. 

Perhaps: need keep ticking otherwise massive defaults happen banks, bankers, people power authorities. life important. wear mask. go out. choice. 

I'm Australia we're thinking all! That's impossible jogging park, even keep 6 ft, without mask research ahs shown leave viral trail (like wake jet plume) affect people 30 feet behind you. still wearing mask.

One simulation shown airborne particles that; far I'm aware real-world evidence transmit sufficient particles lead infection unless someone continuously following jog. talking park tickets? WDW switched demand pricing single multi-day tickets. single adult 1-day 1-park ticket anywhere $110-160 depending exact day choose busy expect be. Adding park hopper option extra $65, though hopping possible moment. Parking $25.

Multi day tickets lower cost per day base ticket park hopper option.

The first outbreak discovery H2H virus like normally first transmitted humans. narrative constructed blame China whenever ends. would say China 1.4 Billion people it’s highly probable hidden millions cases China. I’m sure dead US has. Simple math would back up. China hasn’t given single accurate number anything could million dead knows?  People eat okay work ""skinny-fat."" body fat percentage still unhealthily high, nearly muscle overweight appear basically normal. likely even realize there's problem BMI healthy range. hope auto mod won’t delete comment word “selfish bastard.” scary people becoming numb infected, death rate, horrifying. People like part blamed reporting numbers correctly. Calling medical professionals frauds pretty much. don’t take minute think comment clearly...  Hand washing biggest lie SARS2. Primary means infection breathing in. Hand washing makes feel like something protect reality next pre-symptomatic person indoors going get infected. Outdoors lower risk guarantee. Outdoors probably slows spread enough manageable (data needed) certainly better indoor.

Indoors=death. Upvote choice. I'm dependent.

Hmmmmm Could brainwashed idiots decided great time protest millions across country every major city? 

No couldnt because......lol.....they wore bandannas shouting others faces weeks.

 probably haircuts Sell puts price like. things getting control. Man, get shit together USA leadership massive tragedy like... 135,000 people dying virus 5 months?

There multiple levels incompetence, bordering negligence, people. take minute appreciate starts bad, progressively gets jaw-droppingly worse, ending admission know many people infected ONE party.

Forty-three people tested positive coronavirus large house party Michigan, health officials said Monday.

The party took place July 2 3 Saline area, 9 miles south Ann Arbor.

The majority people tested positive virus 15 25 years old, Washtenaw County Health Department said news release.

At least 66 people — referred “close contacts” — exposed workplaces events following party, according officials.

Close contacts people least 15 minutes “face-to-face contact” someone since tested positive virus, officials said.

These 66 close contacts include family members share household infected.""

So least 109, plus families, contacts. Stunningly irresponsible.  wasn’t Redditor someone twitter screenshot posted reddit. guy used 0.02%, believe people comments section said pulled percentage ass related different demographic, it’s possible there’s merit it. US nutshell:


- guy gets bullied right thing 


- social media (not justice political system) tries correct situation 


- ""land opportunity"", guy seizes opportunity 


- people point ""opportunity"" means US 



Fucked beginning end.... result wearing masks? I'm curious places able get rid it. US still idea we're doing. Corona holiday. Phew! stay home you. sorry wife witnessed, wishing absolute best. totally okay Thai people, social media erupted harder Krakatoa, people extremely - mean extremely - enraged regime treated citizen 2nd class peasant.

Canadian here, one pay attention to. think half Canadians know is. actually studied, wealthier are, less compassion people. Wealthier people likely lie even steal candy CHILDREN controlled study environments.

EDIT: Yeah, also extremely undemocratic, money have, influence political decisions more.

EDIT II: Also, yes, Trump symptom disease, disease itself. clear severe symptom, still symptom. Unless get rid underlying condition, problem erase Trump office. Sorry loss. family came U.S. Europe tell time body size completely normal... culture's mindset isn't.

Your comment unintentionally one hilarious things I've ever read Reddit, saying *a lot*. thank you! unwittingly made evening bit entertaining expected. Thank china 😡😡😡😠 course was. [Still think sounding alarm first time? Oh shit. Never thought that. get brand name priced useless cloth masks??? COUNT IN! morgue is! need save airlines can't drink water? Wtf  also something lead massive civil unrest cause longer people infected longer gurantines max cappacity hospitals go on, long hospitals max cappacity many life saving normal surgeries going delayed going hospitals lead denying care like link provided; even got tired keeping track went ""multiple times"". Last time checked 80+ year olds never suddenly started dying mass numbers cold. Tell someday like live 80+ dying cold would pretty shitty way go. Imagine 80 years old, could live another 20+ years younger population like ""just let die pneumonia."" Also, Dr. Anthony Fauci nearly 80 years old. 80+ people expendable execute everyone turns 80? Idk I'd throw back them. Bring elderly relative everyone thinks fondly of... ask OK individual suffering deadly disease. even headline. Things changed - part Melbourne back lockdown Ted Cruz needs mask cover booger mouth alone also haven’t pandemic proportions 100 years. amount tourism revenue loss worth national risk.

Lol basically ""The majority people experience symptoms, spread around majority people also show symptoms.""

I read articles. Essentially there's enough evidence research yet. still idea spreads even works. like cold. 

This virus going around forever like flu cold. People gonna wearing little dumb masks long time Lol, now? wear surgical mask N95 perform Covid swabs. contamination stay surgical mask makes us feel better re-using N95s. know sure N95 well sealed, require additional protection, half us fail mask fitting test even knows sealing N95s properly. can't really tell without professional seal test. think double masking nessecary outside performing aersol generating procedure, making sure good fit important. YouTube videos help achieve better fit.

Also lot people Florida trolling responsible Floridians posting ask testing locations “don’t go get tested wont get Covid! get Covid going get tested waiting line, waiting room etc” Straight gaslight people stay home. Disgusting. prestige city md middle central brooklyn clean sanitize social distance everything person clinic entire US able same. seen social distance, come answer questions people wait wipe chairs iPads well pens person uses them. They’re top fact people saying “don’t responsible safe getting tested it’ll put risk even more!!!” absolutely absurd. somewhat likely? Yes absolutely people aren’t mindful prudent cleaning distancing overall completely manageable. Also Florida 18-21k tests day nyc 50k-60k day testing speedy results (got 48 hours) helps keep numbers low. nyc could flatten first wave curve idk states couldn’t so. recent ancestors got used life blackouts air raid sirens. fine.   Read yesterday, bullet head herd immunity immunity disappears within year, 15% herd even worst hit areas (Madrid, Spain) get see progress social distancing staying home works, yet still advocate it... like actively want destroy us something China world's superpower. people really need told specific speed limit depending road on? people really need told drink drive? people really need told iron shirt wearing it?

The answer yes. million times yes.  blame shitbags DC. Fuck hope Trump gets COVID Professor Coronavirus. nice ring it. Going teach people epidemiology, community spread, exponential growth real world school hard knocks! u close schools universities, kids find another way hang out. Another reason open schools back up...closed schools leads bad behavior. Border Oregon too. could see descendent settler country show/agricultural fair kind thing - go meet event chew fat.

But far motorsport goes, league Rally (especially long-dead Group B!). Yeah Spanish flu worse barely even math intensive. difficult stuff basic time series pulling decay parameters table. Herd immunity impossible.  ask Sweden.  Oh wait... legal expert, would great court denied claimants damages, additionally awarded attorneys fees + grocery chain. That's way nonsense stop. true debt, actually, student loans. course, debt collectors get first run estate die, already transferred everything kids years (not last second), there's really nothing worry about. 

There's lot unscrupulous debt collectors try get dead people's families acknowledge debt, long cosign never pay cent, debt can't held accountable it. years ago saw people physically hauled plane wouldn’t accept bumped seat paid for. called security dragged man plane. policy. stupid? ran sympathy idiots. many gonna infect that, especially family members. 

If get it, good riddance. Newfoundland similar boat. active local cases (1 positive case traveler isolation). Things quickly shut down, excellent testing contact tracing, things opening people mostly wearing masks avoiding other. confidence stop spread starts again. money Buffalo. weakened immune system made people susceptible disease

Being told family. counter this? told response asking purchase thermometer That’s thinking I’m sure. might death classified COVID pneumonia.

It’s decide risk tolerance there. don’t want COVID, get vaccine. want run risk, don’t get it. 

But don’t get vaccinated, fall ill... don’t expect much sympathy certainly expect rest us shut stubborn. That’s you, wear one. rest us decided get vaccinated. Except wasn’t record. record day before. Hospitalizations actually 5 folks. try limit gratuitous sugar. parents super food controlling, made likely eat junk, trying teach moderation. drink juice, kool-aid, sports drinks. drinks water, ice tea (made mostly stevia, small amount sugar).

If real health care sector need military. Defund military. Less laser cannons, doctors, nurses, EMT's, hospitals. point least assume certain things likely, Cell immunity take place every single disease antibodies made, even Ebola. 

We've also known antibody production rapidly decreases diseases encountered cause mild symptoms (which COVID-19 many people, sometimes symptoms), follows pattern similar diseases. Huh. Interesting. doesn’t sound like help world then. board knows nothing science???!!?? magically go away. honest question. identify Trump sheep vote November? still support republican candidates (senate election)? fine supporting Trump enablers? may support Trump vote people want impeach fact exonerated different sheep. vote people fine romanses world villains like Putin, Erdogan, Kim, sheep. botched almost everything touched, even build damn wall repeal ACA full executive, legislative judicial power. supporting Republicans November, show part sheep team, think better most.

It’s either/or you. 

And gross. virus nowhere near something could end world. Lily Cortes, representative Bolivia’s sex workers union, told Reuters March women may option work streets could work cooperative-run brothels.

Bolivia one heavily unionized countries. sounds like worker owned brothels too? Guess surprising. scary looking flights still happening real time. couldn’t pay get plane drive city COVID-19 severe fully contained within 21st century. AIDS pandemic, started 80s, severe within 21st century, 1 million deaths per year last 20 years.

Covid almost certainly kill AIDS year though (and perhaps already surpassed it, 580,000 official deaths probably lot total). Nice theory can't even get hicks comply let alone imported ones long enough timeline, number deaths infections COVID whether lockdown assuming health care system handle case load. Sweden realized vaccine likely far enough away lockdowns merely delaying inevitable, rather extended lockdown months months decided allow infection spread get with. US capable fighting infection diseases. capability issue, organization. nutcase president leading selfish party represents significant chunk selfish people following whims, nothing gets done (in time). really changed 2% fatality rate, people thought January exactly saying. next one ""ITS DEATHS, LONG LASTING ILLNESS"".

Dude like 105 degrees outside right now. places? russia one vodka. cares facts rational discussion virus fear-mongering raison d’être sub? managed recover how? evidence anything all?

If don’t think handled worse literally every single Governor you’re looking data, comforting narrative desperately want accept. Guess he's escalated Zodiac killings infecting everyone. Tack away, I’m sure lots things I’ve missed on.

Opening schools pandemic isn’t something scream “kids schools” everything magically falls place.

There lots variables consider correct point vast amount people work support kids schools. second place opens even little bit cases surge. 

I disagree this. Barcelona relatively relaxed terms lockdown weeks weeks now. use terrace cafes bars option long time.

Regarding COVID-19... we’re fools led idiots. Pure fucking evil. children EVER attended public school wouldn’t dare . Honestly, point think US government hoping kills weak frees economy. like wear mask ? definitely going like wear vent!

Mask face casket. mean people fucked anyways, I'm forced serve bunch coughing people wearing masks make world better people you’re born own. “Pro-life” slogan. It’s “a lot states”. 21/50 , less half, states require masks worn public currently don’t include Florida, Arizona, Georgia. cute. 5 separate paragraphs still managed say nothing...

Cell immunity guaranteed. COVID-19 disease matter. push agenda, disease, leave medical staff stop pretending actual answers Right - get plane amount $$ today.

Fortunately, early retirement last year ""have"" - old job require ton airplane travel.

Talk lucky timing!

I've getting antsy MAYBE wanting go back work (OK, honestly, lack paycheck that's motivating me..) COVID means pretty much ""can't"" - work, there's zero way avoid fairly regular travel.

That's hope coming. happen either, course, should. survive pandemic without getting I'll surprised. live hotspot essential worker. feel like dodge bullets every. single. day.

True one person much, cost France extra 8 billion dollars. Better nothing.  

""Many live deserve death. die deserve life. give them? eager deal death judgement.""

Listen Gandolf. go bankrupt wont. That’s seems extremely racist, (the democrat definition) also disagree.It travel, people traveling abroad, coming back. Immigrants, dont think blame really hope country lets people coming US, hope might let US citizens haven’t months. headline might make r/agedlikemilk soon... American, OMG KNOW. MAKE STOP!!! beyond terrifying. can't even. I'm kidding.
Please make stop..... Look infections US deaths. 0.04% fatality rate. Sure, I'll wear mask make everyone feel better time, healthy active individual (most Americans aren't), worry. Kids, unless condition already, affected opening schools sound like bad idea. wear masks. That's make adults do.

Edit: sorry everyone, fudged math. 4%. Really hoping state steps overrules across territory. Feel bad OC. I'm hoping PA make mistake. Spanish flu, took everything worked for. I'm gonna fight ass! Let’s try surpass Spanish flu worst pandemic last hundred years ok guys, thanks! Strike. Stop obeying demands failed capitalist system. I’m seeing lots ads commercially made masks incorporate one way exhalation valve. would mean mask protecting wearer. impression purpose wearing mask protect others well yourself. missing something here? safest place keep money right due combination things. First off, nothing outside stocks yielding large returns, eg government bonds. Combine fact fed bailing huge corporations unlimited QE like, risk short term minimal. stock market, opposed place invest businesses tomorrow like capitalists say is, acts like place rich people get guaranteed return investment subsidized tax payers. facet broader economy - holding tank super rich. 

The moment fed support goes belly (probably election something maybe), say goodbye everyone's retirement plans got hitched rich peoples money opposed pensions. One effective defense immune system literally fact produces Memory B Cells completely ignored this, he's absolutely right critique this. think wrote it, Abbott making noises shutdowns, (but actually done anything officially yet). Oh, COURSE person subscribed r/conspiracy saying guy could buy it. He's usually really upbeat optimistic person pretty friendly everyone. really thoughts virus public health flawed Yes. community spread places across globe. 

No. effects global. 5k hospital Houston, different effect 5k hospitalized across world. 

One disaster. Tuesday. Found cause couldn’t get kids results fast enough...welcome real world. Although hope regarding cellular immunity (including T-cell responses) absence durable antibody response, early evidence reinfections puts effectiveness immune responses question many studies show small chance immunity.  coronavirus currently population case. good example 4 common cold (all coronaviruses). immunity lasts longer month so. ""Hey here's idea, I'll post extremely dismissive emojis response covid deaths show think bullshit 'librul hoax' people correctly figure meant, I'll act like they're overreacting think plausible deniability, even though everyone knows really mean matter reality matters!"" - you, probably Again, arguing point misinterpreted continue misinterpret. 🙄 Muting moving on. i’m paying teach human anatomy pandemic average exam score 57 somehow professor blames us Ok aren’t willing. isn’t even speculation. left group chat filled wannabe sociopaths chatting buying distressed properties shit going buying spree I’m like... people dying please, tell plan use mother’s money make even disgustingly rich. boomer, pulling ladder behind yet again?

It’s basically used republicans attack overall much better job majority governors. time didn’t know bad would prepared hospitals flooded people. came pretty close using nyc parks bury people temporarily. suffocate. :( missing out! quality ground breaking research incredible!

Well shit considered gauche compare Sweden Britain, Italy, Spain country higher death rate. allowed compare immediate neighbours death rate lower. Mention UK or, heaven forbid, Belgium (which locked week UK highest COVID-19 death rate world) told locked sooner. proposition becomes unfalsifiable.

sound familiar, r/coronavirus? never heard version speaking before, check several YouTube vids senate testimony confirmation.

Edit: example, When’s last time anything Russia made worked? think current pandemic global?  Check economist article. I've seen similar info states (US) countries, decent resource get general impression extent US, know CDC nationwide accounting (e.g., cause, demographics, etc.) that's usually completed published year two. Murcia, Murica 🙄 🙄 over, expect DeSantis jail hundred thousand counts manslaughter.

Only Trump loses November, vote!! wise get ready White House Advisor DeSantis. Dude looks like lady never understand people pro-life anti-mask. American always filling seats.. flew couple months ago necessity plane 2 &amp; 2. claimed weren’t filling middle seat middle seat. I’ve flown flight dozens time never plane small. Haahhaahhaha could work incentive businesses enforce like people wear mask pay premium higher tax goods. Kind like biohazard handling fee.  I'd even likely start something Tom Cruz saw without mask grandma kid half age, accidentally tell grandma put fucking mask on. let people die already ? mean come complete waste ressources oxygen... mention giving everyone back money canceling flights. Voucher this!!! money gone I’ll never fly American rest life  Yep. real smile always eyes Love term infection Karen's! 1. Democrats 
2. Republicans Wtf ""under investigation"" mean? airline responsibility enforcing policy. don't, that's problem.

""Excuse sir, we're investigating behavior lack accountability."" said 🙄🙄 could interpreted as:

📿😭 😤👊 therefore 🦾 🦴 🧓 👴, hence, 👼👼🛀🏿👼 meaning🥖🤢 🤮 🥨.

 pretty well thought scholarly opinion piece understanding! No. confusing. Originally March government (lied) told us need masks, far right conspiracy theorists loved masks (along anyone knew gov lying understood science). clear epidemic could hurt economy Trump's reelection, Fox News alt right ""news"" organizations started saying hoax started teaching people object afront personal liberties. essentially want us push keep economy going. mostly right wing ""conservatives"" think hoax hurt Trump wear them. Liberal state governments like NY, CA PA strict mask mandates, etc. don’t know current survival rates intubated sounds really high. Weren’t like less half? brought Japan? said continent Asia. read? LMAO!  don’t care get hand pockets. Screw lab rats. Remember, numbers reported yesterday Sunday, Monday Tuesday lowest days week. Deaths weekend reported later week people catch up.

Also, deaths lag surge 2 weeks more. may pick ICUs continue hit capacity, probably least week seeing death toll surge start. stupid people actually be? WTF death toll certinally lot 130000, many places covering like ”they must confirmed test,” attributing things like pneumonia Trump doesn’t control Niad controls cdc can’t fire him. Oh man, people stretch lips upturned show teeth fake smile high?  Speaking rest world, really really really pray country continent lets Americans inside least 2021.  Often reddit someone downvoted oblivion, objectively looked said clear been.

Clearly one situations. Death lagging metric.... Pay play drain swamp! people truly brain washed! Yesterday man said everyone Facebook thinks doctor now. said comments well said woman called racist!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* tho?  reference ""Just 2 weeks herd immunity!!"" believe 1. SARS2-specific antibodies, definitely it. sets absolute minimum baseline.
2. idea suspected infection date, work expected level antibodies extrapolate many people infected given time. However needs lot research yet done far I'm aware; time, there's substitute least sampling antibody levels close suspected date infection.
3. view 2, without knowing T-cell/B-cell immunity (we still really know), best method time, may results actually tell us great deal. without testing point, soon could, measure relationship antibody levels infections all. 3.5m infected WHERE? North Dakota? think so, that's total current number United States combined since began. today (July 14th), North Dakota total 4,446 cases ever people comment political circlejerk posts burger flippers housewives. bar high, can't clear it. Certainly, cases develop antibodies all. 

This documented several diseases (most notably common cold viruses) documented COVID-19 I'm mistaken, always even get stage antibodies formed. Children less likely spread virus also become less sick adults. person education extremely important childhood growth. course implement precautions can, students absolutely need go back school.

Edit: immediately downvoting, please see video article much know why???? Cuz got J-O-B-S Indeed. There's always quite bit fearmongering here.

I understand wanting people take disease seriously, acheive spreading misinformation. Japan contact tracing. already built health system. also urged people avoid closed spaces, crowds, close contact people. Masks probably important non-medical-intervention need things too. Masks lockdown similar effects, masks sustainable. US clear done terrible job. fair though really needs per capita format. Can't speak people around world, seems case they're behaving, people US pathetically soft entitled, even expense others. ""We talked Steve said way cure pandemic infect many people possible."" really sobering angle must like, huh? 

Right now, things TERRIBLE. even fraction then, everyone around dying--the vast majority symptoms would dead within couple days. even know caused it. wonder pretty wild conspiracy theories back then, too. Well, might young children. study people ""ages 18 25"" claim getting week ending April 18, 8.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population 18-to-29 age bracket, compared 128.3 per 100,000 population patients 65. week ending June 27, figures 34.7 306.7 respectively, representing 299% increase hospitalizations young adults, versus 139% increase hospitalizations older adults.

The 33% number seems based many health issues correspond worse covid outlook indication risk definitely get sick. Manufacturing Canada literally begging employees Thanks found results. ignoring Corona news time depressing probably missed  thx. create worldwide ""pandemic"" control masses profit ""cure"". Continuing analogy concerts: since concerts cancelled, probably willing support favorite bands buying merch physical media. willing support universities? now. must pretty young. I'll nice: using ""Hey...."" formal email definite no. practice good manners. 

Heaven forbid write email someone outside US. Sick contracting virus. close 57 million children attend public schools US. 99.9% *don’t* contract virus, leaves ~57,000 children “sick”. cool that? 

We know lot transmissions asymptomatic pre-symptomatic people. 57K infected kids interact teachers, principals, office staff, custodians etc higher risk they’re asymptomatic, turn infect them, many people get sick entertain idea shutting schools? Deaths still spike places hospitals overcrowded turning away patients. get access better treatment can't get treatment However, many current hotspots also rather creative covid death tally, probably leave people die due circumstance reports.

On hand epidemic south still nowhere near bad NYS. enough testing measure extent outbreak there's doubt enormous. church (although attend “smaller” site outskirts town). largely based decision surveys sending congregation. people don’t safe going back. Thankfully NP done great job streaming services. Thank answering. agree term limits. US politics also needs stop sports game two teams field. favorites us vs mentality. comes corruption say democrats corrupt. numbers show much corruption abuse republican side... made second edit care look original post. Understandable get it. there's big difference tourists totally disregarding rules ""fuck it. I'm vacation."" people like wife needed get hell dodge (for reasons mentioned Edit 2 hope slightly understand) totally respectful every step took. Ex: dine inside anywhere, wore mask everywhere, avoided 95% going inside stores, stayed outside mostly, kept distance everyone.

Now, people big fucking yachts pulling restaurants completely wasted going immediately bar without masks? big fucking problem. Old people feel entitled walk past host restaurant sit dirty table wanted *that* table. big fucking problem. young guy's fishing expedition boat complaining covid hoax democrats big plan take Trump. Little realize **more** resist social distancing masks, less tourists get livelihoods destroyed. Basically, dummies can't see bigger picture.

My wife little risk come place everyone follows rules, keep distance, taking seriously. risky places small towns tourist places two reasons (1) locals give fuck &amp; (2) tourists give fuck. Fortunately, fall either two categories. actually putting risk going smaller towns seem care. Thankfully, actively avoided places kept driving.  I’m pretty sure u.s. hit hardest. repeat listen regarding anything says Covid. cares $$$ pleasing boss D. C. nutshell. live predominately white state. African American population 3.6% Hispanic population 1.7%. 5% total population two million people. almost 4,000 cases. breakdown COVID cases like 60% African American 25% Hispanic. It’s insane. That’s like entire community numbers, huge swath representation state sick. It’s pretty clear states shrugging shoulders anything, terrible is. imo first time likely false positive, basic flu second time got real covid concern fetuses.
Once born, long others, it’s obvious lack concern happens children (baby jails? COVID 19?) true motives are. Easy, know plan would mean actually using money people. Open schools, funded contain virus, move privatize.

It's easy jump NAZI's but, first thing went education medical system. Trump wins election guarantee we're goin see overhauls both. way imagine. Huge vetting both. 

Remember Trumps words Fords ""good bloodline"". design imo. Reeks Stephen Miller. ""Person China spreads virus world"" store needs say it’s religion kill people. Problem solved. mean worked gay cake baker. elected treasurer wasn’t good math bankrupted county betting derivatives Yup. huge coordinated effort discredit articles. Like RAGE says, bullet fucking head. know looked up, per CDC 80% elderly got flu vaccine last year. Pretty darn good percentage, sure much higher get. Fuck Ted Cruz always trust forget monroe doctrine, US sabre rattling. Anyone else distracted poorly beard trimmed?

It's like he's trying make head look smaller, gives egg-neck.

That would look better actually followed jaw-line like non-psycho got 21 far sick I’ve ever life. sleep multiple towels fevers migraine terrible doctor prescribed steroid phone could get bed. 0/5 would recommend. ok killing grocery store fast food workers? People problem separating aggregated numbers since March current trend. work, time, 40% asymptomatic? sleeping actually make tired too. Hopefully don’t doubt assertion.

At college, Colgate University, 350 students tested positive March closed down.

Only 6 350 hospitalized...

My school skews white healthy expect severe cases less among random sample, still 1/3 seems like quite presumptuous claim.

EDIT: reading article, realize comment relates headlines content article. I’ll leave though, point still stands. speaking bad AA, prefer Delta. flown AA past problems them. anecdotal accounts reinfections seem suggest symptoms come back stronger. either it’s mild first round provide lasting protection, immunity memory theory doesn’t work cases. OC isn’t city... it’s county, like LA. 

If LA you’d know term Orange Curtain wouldn’t asking question. seriously believe people wearing mask safe? part problem.

Up week ago know single person COVID (personally) know 4. 4 wore mask time anytime outside house. 

They also thought masks would protect them. gave false sense security like seem have.

You realize could wearing 6 N95 masks stacked still contract COVID eyes right???


The way truly prevent would wear full body bio suit time take properly disinfect it. literally never leave house let single person in. Global Warming Canadian plot. plan planting palm trees north shore Lake Superior retirement. disagree. However, zoomers worse, particularly IT. least boomers basic math use semblance correct English. Zoomers actually proud lack education cannot independent research. they're proven incorrect (cf. Reddit), dox ""cancel"" you. think r/iamverysmart fodder relate it? Describing deaths going super Saiyan extremely tasteless given we’re talking people dying mean, coronavirus isn’t Ebola measles, it’s likely imperfect vaccine won’t much damage people. Let’s get done ASAP. also think mandating flu shots elderly children. hate sentiment. 


I went university mature student, I've experienced 'real life'. difficult degree far stressful 'real life'. That's especially true consider time commitment degree, necessity part time work top increased time commitment, looming thought there's homework/studying do. 


I can't wait return 'real life' *only* work 40-60 hours week. Oh, someone say everything US? Shit, missed it. Cases increasing now. done great deal put mind ease, thanks. 👍 two days zero ICU cases last week, correction hindsight apparently Isn’t crazy split falls party lines? Nascar event probably 5% actual race 95% drinking beer, blasting music cooking tailgate. backlog sure. Don’t trust last week. trend clear super positive. :-) teachers show up, Texas going do? Fire all? Hire scabs across border?

Damn gotta racist for? Wide open spaces help. Remoteness helps. hotspot tourism helps.

But also huge weaknesses! Large native population reserves. Lots old age homes. Working class part, lots manufacturing/agriculture/food processing. Huge shipping hub north america. 

Manitoba took seriously day 1. Canada's strategic infectious disease laboratory located Manitoba, there's lots policy procedures established multiple levels government. 

Manitoba gets wear pride, even advantages. One friends got work visa expert Icelandic horses time, Canada experts breed. suspect HCQ also playing part? Meh, World Health Organization pretty shady IMO governor wheel ass classroom full kids 8 hours see likes it. people homicidal maniacs. Good luck Texas! left pro science

Are serious right now? mean like ""bible science"" say ""science""? Disney requires masks, offers mask free zones ANYWHERE park, may well require masks. seriously understand brain damage people coming shit. Already cities take away yoga pants! get pass ... Hawaii secede protect coronavirus. headlines love words ""may"" ""might"". Apparently people point positive trend, ones mental gymnastics... sitting, curious today's daily wave bad news . Excellent! That's exactly hoping hear, thank good sir!

EDIT: Good lady! apologies. antibody testing? university professor honestly confused online learning automatically considered dubious. experience spring professors putting much effort, students putting much less. think online learning something get used work wonderfully everybody willing make work.

I think problem online learning work. does, people motivated. think problem students realizing middle class job market dead— actually, pretty close death even COVID— they're rationally disengaging order focus things.

A college education designed people who, historically, would go leadership roles straight out. name, ""liberal arts"" (as opposed ""servile arts""). education appropriate free men women, opposed serfs. 

In truth, find bit cruel society forces people get educations six levels jobs actually available them. ""Learning learning's sake"" beautiful ideal, realistic people work living. polish diamond that's going put drill?

Even 2020, competitive even get regular serf jobs. Now, even going hard find. blame Zoomers deciding worth time. something dont like stupid! People really seem like they're getting lazy here. think numbers start going people get careful quickly though. There's nobody class conscious top pull levers power. better tho, there's always hope better again. important fight petri dish outside government too, though.

Really don’t get it. Size

Lots long bed lathes mills
Not lot really big 5 axis machines Considering public pays frozen decade, hardly proportional inflation. Wait pandemic use miles partner airline. It’s biggest newspaper Idaho 🤷🏻‍♀️ problems aside occasional paywall.  740 hospital staff roughly equivalent number healthcare workers died virus far believe. well reduced auto fatalities, reduced work related injuries, shift many causes death people suddenly staying home (leading sedentary lifestyle). Exactly. Part also time management, latest generation students horrible doing. rabid minority given platform. board cannot make individual school districts go back school without masks, etc. school district decide path forward. would say that? know me? Triggered easily..lol many days' stock masks shops?

How long replenish those?

How soon someone actually go get one — bearing mind option mail order meet deadline?

At least week seems reasonable, ten days way like there's easy way ensure mask bought cheaply way first store visit. .. maybe watch actual statistics, realize anything curtail numbers. fact opening instead, schools mandated reopen brick mortar. Anti maskers spreading disinformation conspiracies. ICUs nearing maximum capacity. going get tired winning.  I’d probably say trump fits bill better. one said send text messages, neither pages real. default trying helpful, getting scam vibes you. ever happened Brazil ? That'd like bus full children crashing survivors every day year. stop buses happening? yet still call ""Chinese Virus"" Every parent normal sized kid thinks case study raise normal sized kid.

My parents (who obese) actually praise none four kids overweight. truly cringey this, parents deserve credit. parents keep whole lot processed junk food, nontheless kids ate shitload junkfood behind backs.  parents great cooks, cuisine healthy all. Lots fried foods carbs. soda dinner least twice week. dad would serve cinnamon toast side dish dinner! dessert, starch.

They lucked out. That's it. lucky metabolisms could handle shit ate lucky coped stress low self-esteem (that helped inflict) ways always involve food. I'm sure tell parents set us good eating habits day dot too, know mark that. launched world's first satellite knows. 

If effective allow outside groups conducts studies, propose call Sputnik prick. US making anti-mask anti-social distancing signs preparation.  Source? evidence Florida different strain disease. Also given many New Yorkers come winter almost guaranteed spread state started people coming northeast.

The massive increase infections Florida infectious strain, exponential growth combined one giving shit. state still mask mandate fucks sake.

The deaths coming. Florida already huge increases pneumonia deaths unknown deaths year, definitely least partially Covid related. new cases lag 2+ weeks lot deaths, given much state trying hide death numbers lot reported pneumonia unknown well. I’m usually desperate good news I’ll take anything. I’m straight buying. fucking sketchy coming fast. Also doesn’t help there’s word now. I’m telling sketchy written it. I'm totally guessing - seems like younger people would likely fast food retail jobs deal public certain political party breached side social compact, ever believed one Newsom caved anti-lockdown protesters opened quickly. 

My city phase 2 literally 3 days opening phase 3 Newsom signed it. let virus spread unchecked, go exponential growth (number case doubles every days) completely crash hospitals. Death rates relatively low long people get care. hospitals, fatality would likely somewhere 5% range. advised type conversation usually fruitful, people want believe want believe. study done many people likely cross immunity Covid coronavirus infections past dog fight asking wasnt case. aware severe reporting lag either. thing called words much way unions Texas? wouldn’t surprised wasn’t place registered Dems Republicans county several seats went blue first time (Katie Porter, Harley Rouda). coastal county low numbers hordes rushed beach towns.

Now lockdown. 

People selfish stupid. Can't tell many NJ states surging right quarantining wearing masks. work amusement park disgusting. actual fuck wrong brains

Hyperpartisanisation. radar necessarily warning sign either

I mean media; mean published research, announced they'd lined manufacturing, begun Phase 2/3 trials. ""On radar"" means see far away, building getting closer there... literally gone software terms alpha release candidate 30 seconds. India; they've making lots noise exactly graceful arrival. Lol, immigrating internationally nearly easy EU, moving different country EU. can’t see it’s different yes really think stupid. Sorry pointing context apparent “bullshit” sorry degrees bad apparently appalling lol.

You also notice didn’t “discount downplay” covid way shape form fashion. Try actually reading rant soapbox. response, Trump supporters double efforts also try discredit entire AAMC baby county taken ER skin rash. Tested positive COVID. Fever subsided discharged. Died next day. 6 weeks old. live Jacksonville FL. wear mask avoid groups judged choice. People think I'm extremely overreacting. Thankfully city made masks mandatory many people still refuse. People sharing fake stories Facebook know someone harmed wearing mask. understand many people opinions. know someone died Covid. know several people got sick. know someone tested positive barely symptoms. know someone likely survive caught it. anti maskers anyone risk? know anyone died? get many people want let people die. Ghost Robert Koch here. send ventilators, I'll send healthcare workers, I'll send professionals who've dealt know, around country.

I understand part makes uncomfortable. already much stress danger people little PPE available them. Greenbrier resort hosting world tennis matches weeks 500 spectators plus athletes, etc. Still owes state like $1M flood cleanup there. He's corrupt idiot. Right right we’re one, runoff exponential growth many parts country. Anything better nothing, mask policies aren’t tool have.

My point mask policy *alone* solve exponential growth long long R0 value higher 1.6, percentage spread reduced remains same. 

This counter lot people I’ve seen acting like masks pointless, shouldn’t worn.

Edit: add R0 value already less 1.6, would much lower 1, 1.6 would over. chose highest possible started R0 value get new R0 value less 1.

If take steps social distancing, brings lower. mask policy one simplest policies, one certain areas world, already standard every day life, even without COVID. It’s like wearing clothes. doesn’t cause emotional issues social distancing can. It’s cheaper. Less impactful economy, etc. R0 value less 1, virus eventually go away. take measures spread get with. We’ve already wasted much time people already bored, without solving anything. *monkey paw curls* Looks like Swedes keeps sweeping rug ridiculous downvoting. point looking wrong date, counting back three weeks rise deaths started see rise cases start.

Use seven day moving averages avoid dealing holiday issues You’re missing major point: Shut Entire world months. Schools, sports, travel, hotels, casinos, cruises, restaurants, theme parks... empty cleared weeks weeks way never even approximated modern world. STILL killed first wave. provide sources around protests spreading COVID? Google pops articles say major spread due protests. I’d love see something says different.

[source Yes, they’re def living delusion... also, entire situation explain proves stock market reflect economic strength. 

I think many friends family thought living delusion back mid February started working home almost everyday. understand average person doesn’t study infectious diseases extent bc diff interests pursue different majors college. Additionally, due work travel coincidences (like Dec trip China getting postponed 3 months... cancelled completely), gut feeling start working home. also decided reallocate retirement contributions (I meaning change portfolio time anyway wanted make less aggressive due recent personal life events). 

Despite people anticipating next market crash happen many points throughout past 2-3 years (bc yknow... can’t time market), reason thought omg... virus, something totally... unforeseen?, suddenly introduced human population reason next crash. bc surge tech advances many people getting approved mortgages homes means... bc something that’s effect created humans (I know easily whole debate lol, point right now). 

My main point though - blows mind stock market been, respect leaders politicizing pandemic... well ignorant people truly are. There's studies waste time. Masks prevent COVID, minimise risk. common sense see that, studying necessary unless really want get percentages see point. Fast forward 20 years, vaults open survivors Texas creep derelict wasteland super mutants, feral ghouls and... Oh that's Fallout it. 
Texas going brutal time while. technically destroying biodiverse earth left piece shit hope dies slow. Illinois 4th country # deaths 9th rank deaths per capita. deaths happened April May. That's kind absurd. Many people need deserving. Except common cold actually multiple viruses. Also, COVID-19 still kills shitload people. went strict quarantines, still 130k dead Americans.

The masks good stopgap vaccines rolled out. brushing science.  Wizards' best player left active now? Thomas Bryant? Rui? DeSatanist, August 2020: “So let get right, Donald. We’re going call new division “the Gestapo?” There’s thing called google. Johnny Johnny YES PAPA

Wear mask PAPA

social distance PAPA

contact tracing PAPA

take vaccine HA HA HA  game plan regular election. signs point it. Well considering traveled Orlando yet... yeah. positivity rate tests still go up. thank god covid19 hit college, lot things not....best practices. Oh yes. WAIT TWO WEEKS. think I've seen movie before. version Florida apocalypse this? 3.0? lose track. Currently FL debating hot frying pan get shut business voluntarily live savings while. It’s getting pretty close. Russia known use bots United States spread anti-vaccination ideology. really hope isn’t elaborate ruse increase anti-vaccination beliefs dude right. Teachers Texas need oragnize work together shut damn system anyways. 

Why fuck would go deaths like cattle? High quality video ""biffdipstick"" 900 views last five days **COVID-19 Community Research Partnership - Updates Data** 
Wake Forest Baptist Health. Updated 6/30/2020.  

This research found COVID-19 mortality rates around 0.1%. Children even much less susceptible suffer less symptoms according empirical data. numbers lie. part false narrative mentioned? (Some) people reddit certainly know this. 

These titles always worded deceptive inflammatory way, straight wrong. trifecta FL, TX AZ tip iceberg. southern states absolutely *determined* follow footsteps. isn’t isolated problem. know safe without COVID died makes COVID cause death. Cancer patients die heart attack organ failure cancer death certificate, related issues. taken like 3+ weeks virus peak areas actually lock down? sure anyone would expect peak less time state still even mask mandate. say live go I'm one people wearing mask. one gives shit here. says linked tweet Last week Texas reported covid death May 24 Yes?

I mainly referring subtitle ""Almost half Covid-19 patients hospitalised show scan abnormalities resemble early stages heart failure, global research study reveals."" says half patients, instead half scanned patients, opinion bit misleading due selection bias. Free-Dumb. phase 1 yeah trust Yes Five weeks when? understand giving people day two get ready. whole 10 days?? Yea thought making America great again. Like pulled together like Probably food alcohol addict.... maybe part realizes fucked state political career especially come November dear leader put curb. suppose, really bad, could try route. You’d look rules locality/state imagine would require something breaks law part oath office, involve lengthy trial-like process. 

Where am, it’s point, exposing poor leadership skills. find skin crawling someone leadership position tries place blame elsewhere. Placing blame ain’t gonna fix anything, I’m finding like abide “the buck stops here” saying. want things done, today, working towards fixing mess. usually find, me, least local state reps, they’re pretty responsive communications. They’ll either help out, tell they’re doing, point direction help really can’t/won’t help out. gets props me, help get vote they’re supporting issues larger scale direction want go. 

It’s great situation way look it, hope things part solution problem. things like wear mask, wash hands, social distance, support small businesses money volunteer time, communicate wants concerns elected officials, vote conscience time comes. don’t know much difference make end, least fell like I’m something instead waiting someone capable come along. Shift current graph far left couple months ago max cases max deaths far weeks ago minimum cases minimum deaths.

Then notice death rate climbing roughly rate case rate back ""So, chosen death."" researchers know this, cnbc article full mights, mays, suggests, people still feel need point out. Glad see lip service thank-yous France Calling stupid feels like excuse behavior. Call is, evil mass murderer mean took hockey team away us. practically forcing us move canada lol Isn’t point virus effect heart? one seen well studied lung changes. half asymptomatic cases 75% symptomatic cases show CT changes lungs, know follow scans generally heal within 2 months, though seen studies regarding lingering functional impact. 

Other comparable virus know cause chronic fatigue symptoms 10-20% people, long expected last prevelant properly studied yet. 

Loss smell taste occur least 27% people. 1 month follow up, 50% report complete recovery, 40% report partial recovery, 10% report recovery. clear long last 10%. Loss smell taste risk factor depression people take extra care mental health. deaths among teachers compare general population?  don’t significant risk factors, however pretty sure don’t want get thing. chose thrusting family poverty continuing work despite health risks. chose continue work. understand everyone’s choice different. I’m pointing large portion population already made choice. it’s time teachers make choice. live VT (low infection state)and I’m close making choice send kids school exactly what's happening. Trump absolutely destroying country unifying nightmare. crazy me. Yes hospitals little long-in-the-tooth states (lived countries) sure might wait little bit longer go ER broken finger something wouldn’t rather completely financially ruined lose job go hospital? It’s literally propaganda Americans taught decry Canadian health care system. recalled murder? Karen-1 Karen-18 again? districts majority parents work service jobs.  Detroit compared Bloomfield instance. They’re protesting bus drivers masks, sure they’d make school safe. Thank @tomaskenn courage. 
Again, thank bottom heart. Still learned lesson, eh?

Ok...please pick number deaths want, Mr. Governor, actually make right choice.

#It complicated follow regulations infection tracing Infection Control Act. Swedish Public Health Agency come conclusion infection tracing increased result corona.


- old-fashioned possible make ""quick fix"" it. repeal regulation provide guidance end week, says Bitte Bråstad, chief legal officer Public Health Authority.

[The regulations infection tracing]( Infection Control Act need changed. Public Health Authority found that, therefore authority wants repeal - despite fact new regulations place.

- old, tricky difficult apply. good comes facilitating tracing infection, says Bitte Bråstad, General Counsel Swedish Public Health Agency.

The regulations scheduled repealed already week. 

- make change make modern. already started, take months. repeal regulation provide guidance end week, guidance work meantime new regulations ready. 

According Bitte Bråstad, regulations ""lived peace quiet"" corona pandemic knocked door.

- started looking saw possible. detailed. Infection tracking take place much larger scale future, must easy follow rules, says.

#The regulations repealed state, example, infection tracing delegated competencies required allowed carry out.

- cumbersome. repeal them, usual rules apply, operations manager distributes work. dealing delegations, bureaucratic framework applies intend remove, says Bitte Bråstad.

**Is risk repealing regulations?**
- None lawyers experts objected proposal. Infection Control Act good, good rules, important support meantime. initially thought could get new regulations summer, get started soon possible August. need get everyone involved comment changes difficult holidays.

There lot garbage stock’s bonds getting bouyed disagree, someone went school late 20's blast.  referring? Vitamin acetyl-cysteine?

Mucomyst comes least one form put water dissolve. dissolved medication could put smoothie.

L-Cystein-powder could possibly dissolved smoothies uncertain well dissolves fluifs water really uncertain well would like smell taste raw powder dissolved smoothies. Since L-Cysteine sulphuric compound smells like rotten eggs something like reaaly foul. tight capsules even tight capsules smells really foul almost retch open pillbox contains Cysteine-capsules. 

I hope know vitamin vitamin-compound, name taging along since older naming.
It like hormone. stated study else take 10 000 IU compared 250 micrograms vitamin D. take D2 or/and D3. mindful dosages since Vitamin fat-soluble stored body. safe take 4 000 IU feel necessary extended periods time. 

Vitamin produced bodies outside day least 30 minutes direct sunlight, even cloudy day like today. get enough summer part winter-time. 

If live like country far north need supplement vitamin darker months year September /October February /March least dosages upto 2 000 IU per day. Perhaps more, depends diet winter go get light. winter months sunlight weak help body produce vitamin helps sustain body winter-time. 

And really dark skin live north North Africa probably need supplement Vitamin year round. inside almost never get go outside like many residents care homes assisted living homes also need year round supplementation vitamin D, probably more. 

I allergic sheep's wool take vitamin since made sheep's wool. found Swedish brand Holistic makes vitamin D3 suspended olive oil. works really well me. vould dropps smoothies.

Excerpts video OP: SVT goes hospital empty operating rooms ask HCW empty. HCW replies it’s staffing shortage. journalist explains lack personnel caused moved regular departments help COVID wards. caused many cancelled operations, healthcare eventually forced make many tough priorities. HCW says huge challenge patients prioritize get started [i.e. normal healthcare resumes].

After talk admin says basically staff can’t handle shouldering burden normal care summer need rest, resuming fall plan.

The journalist explains one say care return normal sure.

Also, idea SVT split two articles since clearly go together here’s another part story: [Gunilla suffers painful hip joint - gets surgery]( consequence corona crisis operations urgent vital canceled Värmland. affects Gunilla Edqvist, waiting new hip joint several months would surgery end March. 

#- appalled, says operation could performed.

Gunilla alone surgery postponed, according figures SVT taken note of, number non-emergency operations decreased 72 percent Värmland result prioritization made corona crisis. 

Tobias Kjellberg, healthcare manager Region Värmland, believes assessments made patient. Unfortunately he’s shooting blanks. continue attack claims provide nothing own. almost like two political parties enough represent political positions country.

I know long take us reform elections, hope sooner rather later.  booming industries benefiting pandemic. would recommend taking internships part time job looking something solid. #Tranlsation:

Inger Brolin convinced husband Christer, 76, would living today stood demanded ambulance called became seriously ill early May.


At time, responsible healthcare staff Sörklippan's elderly home Bromma called told diabetic husband, fever cough days earlier, become worse. eat corona test done positive - something communicated family before.

After talking daughter received message, Inger called back demanded ambulance called.


""He go hospital now. ill "", said told prognosis diabetics fall ill covid-19 look good.


""Had ensured ambulance called, would dead today,"" says Inger Brolin.



Inger's husband taken hospital ambulance. days, doctor called hospital announce Christer ill family preparing fact might able cope.


But turned.

- far know, doctor involved assessing husband's condition.

After ten days hospital, Christer discharged returned Sörklippan's accommodation.

Inger Brolin critical accommodation's actions:

- made sure ambulance called, would dead today. far know, doctor involved assessing husband's condition. staff accommodation fought hard throughout pandemic, shadow fall them. management broken down, says.

- know Christer sat living room residents tested positive corona. relatives receive information situation accommodation, many infected died, says Inger Brolin.

Sörklippan's nursing care home one 91 residents examined extra Inspection Health Care, Ivo, found shortcomings connection review 1700 housing Sweden. purpose review investigate whether people living homes received proper individual care pandemic.

According Ivo, examples people fallen ill covid-19 received individual medical assessment. Instead, general assessments made, led elderly badly.


Helena Piensoho, Head Unit Sörklippan's nursing care home, want comment individual case, says welcomes Ivo's review, includes review medical records.


- good go medical records, specific indications shortcomings business apart established infection, says.


Helena Piensoho want tell many people infected deceased current housing, says residents become ill receive individual assessment doctor.


- followed recommendations exist Swedish Public Health Agency mixed infected healthy. always relied cohort care, says.


#I lost confidence accommodation everything happened.

Inger Brolin reported accommodation Ivo, turn referred fact Bromma district committee must given opportunity respond criticism, waiting hear them.

- heard shortcomings private housing first place municipal accommodation worked. lost confidence accommodation everything happened. whole family guard. worried time. may rich surely stupid. First all, thought common knowledge point masks source control, PPE. Everyone wears one protect around case infected know it.

But point want make masks cheap, practical, positive impact slowing spread available evidence - including countries brought control. need perfect important tool toolbox. People aware perfect also aware best enemy good. need kill epidemic bring contagiousness enough longer self sustaining, average infected person infects less one additional person.   Trump turns 3 mile island Chernobyl dump immediately briefing congresspeople privy to? tell high-level donors dump stock? downplaying coronavirus general public? answer “no” these, please sit down, won’t investigated.  Americans don’t much freedom emigrate anywhere. move freely within EU you’re EU citizen. Totally different situation. Paywall. post article? said, US average IQ definition IQ pins 100 US average soon invade. joke, almost would like invade force health care properly funded education system country. guys seem want things mostly seems leaders fucking up. frustrating watching another country. late. Open up. lead men operate nuclear reactors ships go excess 400 feet beneath surface ocean. say don’t learn regularly bit insane.


I track Chinese, aren’t winning shit. They’re actually pretty bad ocean. think colleges fighting hard open Fall? I’ll give hint, it’s care students “learning experience” Masks, social distancing, regionalized immunity need stop warm reading stats. conservatives liberals. understand guys enjoy insulting other. VIDEOGAMES need PLAYERS. instead arguing amongst yourselves, fucking play dammit! D:&lt; shutting simple miraculous policy like would make difference.

the entire us gov p.o.s, corrupted incompetent like mega size bloated dead body.

and ppl believe science make judgement based FACTS. 

Should two poins otherwise, shit show would 2nd quarter already.

 keep blaming china CURED like beef chuck. I’d pissed. paid absurd amount college, absolutely got lot it. didn’t pay classes, paid experience, particularly, person classroom experience/debate. 

I’m saying online school bad, it’s great option many. you’re paying person school, that’s experience want/chose/need....this fucked rate they’ll lucky higher taxes consequences face greed. I’m rooting full blown French Revolution. lot rumors floating around earlier reporting specific cases certainly official show sue state. I'm sorry go this. excludes fact people say ""I'm pretty sure already it. I'm gonna wear mask.""

My neighbor across street. tried telling trip Florida gone party worried ""already it"" called selfish cunt told stay fuck away property. DR FAUCI, LOVE YOU! Allows researches obtain certainty efficacy vaccine trialing. vaccinated patients show high level neutralizing vaccines means likely immune (at least confirmation works apart clinical trial data itself). (Note vaccine may still work even specific antibodies present large numbers may others.) important material cloth masks made of? considering muslin one toddlers since lightweight. there's profit TSA stock right companies... hope Europe ready flood refugees coming americas. Yes, people choose get COVID go willingly enjoy it.

What terrible comparison.  That’s terrible. I’ve heard many stories like this. Wishing well. flown quite bit since pandemic began guarantee zero airlines filling seats. hope able avoid flying mindset. indoors infected people help. two kids school Orange County. grandparents drop pick day wife work full time. seriously honestly don’t know I’m going do.   Ostrich Effect think get getting something August. threshold lower though, reading 40K gross? vs 75K first time. Makes doubt reporting deaths. happens restrictions.

Make less X

If already get check gov, welfare/SS/unemployment may qualify etc Governer Abbot apparently lacks basic reasoning math skills. Disney World great place especially kid, millions visitors year. United States country million people year decide start new life immigrate to. bad gilded outhouses. honestly tastes really good. Europeans exaggerate much added, usually 3 4 grams per slice, big deal unless like 6 slices bread day anyway. toasted, tastes slightly caramelized amazing PB+J sandwich buttered toast. recommends infected people trace contacts generally **generally work**. Denmark thought would exception tried failed. Sweden fail this. friend got coronavirus living Hawaii 5 years. struggle find work would pay well enough live even best times. landed dream job hotel last fall making money ever made life considerable margin. Laid back April. employment since. moving back home end month.  taking political position getting mad calling it?

Also classic. Ohioan, it’s amazing see turn would usually considered base, too. It’s first I’ve really observed disinformation campaign close. Anti science anti intellectualism toxin worse pandemic, looks bloated, must drinking LOT i'll little surprised fast.

i'm still waiting 2 deaths county newspapers reported friday/saturday show state records, one death neighboring county reported yesterday well. positive case numbers much higher harder differentiate (Translation Google. Let know spot faults I'll correct them!)

**A closed society would resulted fewer deaths covid-19 Sweden. Anders Björkman, professor infection medicine, tells SvD. time, states Sweden many one million infected viral disease.**

Sweden's high death toll covid-19 cannot explained fact country shut extent others. This opinion Anders Björkman, professor infectious disease medicine Karolinska Institutet, compared development deaths different countries.

In interview Svenska Dagbladet, Björkman points instead Swedish death toll linked country outbreak measures put place.

**More one million infected**

When Sweden introduced restrictions virus, spread society become greater neighboring countries fewer deaths.

However, reason unclear, says professor.

- different societal structures. But definitive answer explains happened way did, says SvD.

According Anders Björkman, death toll different countries gives indication many infected viral disease.

In Sweden, 5,000 died, estimates number infected people around one million people.

**Declining trend Sweden**

During Thursday's press conference, Swedish Public Health Agency announced Sweden sees declining trend development infection. Fewer cared IVA fewer receive positive answers tested covid-19.

At time, government commissioned several authorities prepare for a potential second wave autumn.

- second wave comes autumn, probably matter cluster infection, outbreak Gällivare, said Minister Social Affairs Lena Hallengren press conference Monday.

She continued:

- important plans regionally, nationally, explains. Kind ruins satire point out. Actually, link posted address question, someone else helpfully answered, either know anything, unhelpful person, both. Yeah. really thought need add /s make clear... seated next him, shut put fucking mask on. that's me. Full Karen mode appropriate. 😂🤘 Frustrating? simplifying regulations ""old, tricky difficult apply"" ""It old-fashioned possible make ""quick fix"" it."" think that's bad thing. Holy... Also study London showed patients antibodies longer antibodies 3 months later :( rest UK still 80-90 deaths per day (7 day rolling average)??? *their home Remember sent hospital ships New York full military absolutely nothing help bringing covid patients board werent supposed decided ""meant that"" treating covid payients onboard?

Or National guard stations open month didnt treat single patient?

Im going limb theyre sending military absolutely nothing Maybe maybe not. Lots policies place north specifically stem spread. I’d surprised got really control northeast Keep kids home folks. top facial recognition, start rumor “masks protect 5G”. dumb conspiracy they’ve come with. Problem solved! So, intended negative comment, everyone, mean, everyone already will. important thing have. Especially married kids, crucially important, one, one like $99. exactly current consensus infection hard surfaces? agree safety part it, JFC kids learn socialize normally *screwed*. he’s going jail expect Andrew Cuomo him. Okay. personally, doesn’t sound offensive. thanks professor dingle berry Everyone masking much possible good get without shutting costing jobs everyone spiraling debt. I’d still say it’s closer end year everyone masking up, people definitely spread indoor without masks.  eaten restaurant since February. I'm still alive typing right now. closely people Florida Arizona adhere social distancing recommendations? Cases generally number tests came back day before, necessarily taken day before, since week get results results need transmitted chain health departments. Hospital cases reported different pool.

The death numbers depend want compare. Deaths currently worst NY/NJ, trending upwards every state. shift Y-axis 20 days chart infections deaths account lag dying reporting, looks like next weeks going return hell.

But know sure yet, since lot things different current outbreaks regard age infected, total infected NY/NJ really known time, etc. Posting articles originally written language know bad idea considering frequent mistranslations proven be. rest UK still 80-90 deaths per day (7 day rolling average)??? four-hour drive we're looking back nearest Southwest airport :( big deal vacations, non-quarantine times, travel month work. Oooh I've seen one. Next deploy giant floating hospitals. Maybe emphasis sort shelter place. Also maybe tell people wear masks distance others. ""Plants mistreated""

What gonna then? Soak sunlight nutriants? north places mosquitos? Betsy Devos said fine .02% children die this. Even taking account infect others, many KID COFFINS going need? many parents start planning funerals? pathetic. true all. dad lives Winnipeg wealthy point diagnosed colon cancer would problem going Mayo clinic treatment. Many specialists friends field convinced stay Winnipeg surgery team doctors ended incredible. woods yet man saw many people read first tweet started going him...smh need ""sow distrust."" lied American public. uptake smoking occur? born cigarette hand? 

If want save 500k lives every year, maybe lower hanging fruit might starting banning smoking shutting country, locking people homes, destroying entire industries, jobs, cities, generating trillions dollars goverment debt... Dunno, thought. US folks, honestly, think chances another cash stimulus? Holy shit USA, really hitting meth pipe hard lately already citizenship another country seriously considering leaving while. 

The main difficulties taxes immigration, I'd need talk accountant immigration lawyer. church since late February. online church. listen Dwell Bible app, watch Bible Project videos, many online churches (not home church). realize ""go"" church online, restricted geographic region limited people happen live around you. I'd rather die point. least student loans would vanish. understanding Oxford vaccine dead shell type. Moderna Pfizer ones mrna vaccines new technology/type vaccine. I'm paraphrasing I'm dumb, mrna type dead shell instead created pseudo anti-body. Someone please correct I'm wrong. Looks like doomers reached bottom. went dead bodies streets ice cream sales going down... friend Germany lived job. requested transferred back Germany approved it. packed wife kids went back pay cut get US. Man get problematic use locations you? 

It's fine using different naming techniques fine hurtful people.

Maybe understand next virus originates country people start looking countrymen' differently even though can't possibly fault.

I bet right see Chinese person automatically assume must carrying virus right? Even though US literally 100 times cases China does? 
That's problem. could also strong nationwide strategy oh well. We'll check daily thread 7/20 newest science says significant benefit done whole time, little extensions there

I would shocked gets opened like normal year OMG deserves million upvotes. Thank sharing. Moderate ages 45-74 insignificant. Also consider death negative side effect serious infection like covid factor discussing. Impaired lung function, mobility, heart damage, etc seriously impact QoL longevity. dad traveled recently. asked copy lawyers contact information. people visiting Florida July Got links scientific studies showing kids vectors? Nyc 9 million people. Much Manitoba. unspoken law life know word defenestrate exists use every given opportunity without fail Dumpster fire OC right I'm sure 100% right. Abbott definitely kind authority initiate lockdown. problem Texas state income tax, rely sources tax revenue, like sales taxes property taxes. makes difficult fund state government lockdown. reason, he'll get way local authorities enforcing policies.

His decision enforce lockdown makes slightly sense ""die save economy"" bandwagon, he's twat lying still making wrong decision. investigate? 

We already sufficient evidence *was wearing mask*. Time discuss consequences! point give back Britain? “With sun comes glass suction” haha Stupid stupid wants. People want right infringed I'm like, ""What rights dead got someone else killed due negligence?"" 

-Oklahoma Resident  Wow Americans next level stupidity good. understand rock hard place, good amount experience coming college courses. Students forced take classes reach arbitrary amount hours get degree. majority experiences students receive remember joining clubs, student council roles, engaging peers, job fairs. additional opportunities students also paying for, classes.

Also, highest paid government workers state usually goes coach athletic director schools. Students get either.  Except GDP reason one first get vaccine matter developed mass quantity. cure. USA wont waiting like many countries GDP. Look 300 million doses already many vaccines like Oxford. Swedish online defense force action downvotes again. spend half much energy preventing deaths... GOP spent decades cutting education budgets funding propaganda media like Fox News. AKA ""going outside"" That’s literally drinking age uniform 21 years old across country. Withdrawal funding roads states lower drinking age. remember president smart diplomatic regardless many homes have, hold *residency* one state. second home Florida, out-of-state visitor here. number Florida residents summer homes western NC, mostly escape heat. That's partially there's nothing pandemic. Grandson got sick every two weeks kindergarten. like clockwork, least one family member got sick well time. Everyone got flu too. staying home cases go down. best him? No, course not, school still months. looked school even compulsory state age seven (in past, parents even used skip kindergarten). pandemic healthy important. Luckily, online option, pain again, life-threatening virus. Every sept/oct couple/few weeks school starts get sick. bring something home petri dish classroom whole house sick takes weeks work us we're back normal. There's way works. think Texas lagging 9 days reporting right now. that's tests, hospitalizations think easily track closer real time. Adding this.. that’s medical professionals suggesting it’ll similar flu. take flu shot yearly? single shot won’t enough cure life. this. Yearly however long need repeat shot keep immunity Thanks sharing UK data. definitely added nuance conversation around numbers. Yeah worry, us sensible Floridians fucking hate guy. Although, DEM running recently busted meth party Miami... Damn, guess Florida really live reputation... word ""investigation"" mean anything anymore lol design. People go bars OC, get tested LA. competency displayed god emperor? little misleading sense 575K people died Swine Flu first year outbreak. Emphasis needs maximum death toll ESTIMATE. assumption incorrect. I've also never indicated fault teachers, I'm sure defensive it. claiming US public schools hold ""Socratic seminars"" fucking laughable. think you’re misinterpreting motivation behind change regulations. It’s allow regions put responsibility tracing infected - that’s already happening. It’s old regulation specific qualifications needed perform contact tracing. allowing local delegation, regional hospitals allowed use existing staff (for instance people clerical positions) instead medical staff tracing. That's comment one big strawman.

I'm religious person, think exemplifying country protections religious freedom.

You're worried money, corono. interest mad ""churches"", obviously considering Christians.  got estimate many deaths we'd smoking restrict much like selling kids, banning restaurants, planes, shops, preventing fr.being advertised all...

I mean seem like much compromise vs shutting country/world, locking people home, destroying economy, massive unemployment. 

Who kidding, look numbers hard data objectively. admit didn’t understand way virus spread, learn mistake, move on. 

Like, wtf. 

It isn’t personal attack you. sub horrible misinformation. isn’t shocking get information you’d incredibly misinformed. 

Just better. Sheesh. Proverbial? Wtf Exactly!!! seen French protest? lip service cut France. French people hold government's feet fire. USA! USA! used surgical masks medical masks, random-ass cotton masks unknown layer count bandanas... original comment misworded. know masks *do* help, yet seen study tests efficacy different types people wearing, instead medical/surgical ones reserved front line workers. news, American Airlines stock plummet again. Eh, rethink Delaware bit. Cases seem low, tiny state. 0.05% mortality rate Singapore doing. They’re school district. 

Pushed edge, kids staying home. don’t need goto dystopian horror show scar lives Thanks correcting me. ya, Manitoba zero. Tell school want happen don’t support school they’re listening. NNJ, masks time. 100% mask compliance Costco grocery store I've seen. cops follow rules, surely schools give governor's orders big ""f**k you"".

Or work gang-related organisations like police? Hey someone pointing real problem something thats bs.

The rich equal others according country article say National average death rate 4%? sounds... really fucking useless least day kid randomly falls chair classes age. reason. fall chair. person school year destined fail epic ways written history books. think general recommendation Sweden issue warnings citizens travel unnecessarily countries restrictions Sweden - restrictions become severe (for example cut flights, etc) citizens way come home without Foreign Department getting involved. love higher ups job exhaust powers beyond actually charge of? seems low lot daily expenses either low applicable. US need car. Even wealthier people Paris buy cars transit system good. Many employers pay pass, too. Paris also property tax apartment outright, pay HOA utilities. Cell phone service also heavily regulated unusual pay 20 40 euros month good service. examples healthcare, retirement, mandatory paid leave ways someone wealthy still live comfortable life dignity. 26,000 euros per year go long way. antibodies made incredibly cool process especially recombination targeted mutation happens cells  Mickey money-worshipping plague rat. Who’s surprised? sounds like need fucking strike then.

If union cant take primary form collective action boss, hardly union still aparenly real. Hmm, maybe read something wrong emerging story immunity gained contracting Covid-19 might last months. Hahaha miles racked nothing? Semantics? I'm asking serious question. odds families dead close non existent. anything, residents risk.

You must live dull life always going back find worst every situation.


""Father five recovers cancer!""

*Yes think others die cancer every year. dare celebrate good news*  watched entire meeting. 22 speakers, 18 kept repeating “there’s 0.00 chance children spread it!” one member would smile wide. shit show. regard staff safety whatsoever. Start looking/asking flu shot around early August/September!

That anecdote, advice. millions Americans living abroad. kid, let tell you, let make clear,"" Trump told reporter Monday, asked kidding said Saturday instructed administration slow coronavirus testing.  knew wouldn’t it. It’s get much worse unemployment rate remains highest nation proving? interview garbage basically kept saying “idk can’t idk. Wear mask. Idk” Ok. Thanks that, thanks posters thread passionately making points matter. see direct quote extrapolated various conversations others around had. 
My opinion still forming. much confusion anything try get mental grasp days. 

Just case it’s relevant. don’t like want understand clearly people like wrong right. Haha. brave. I'm specifically refering basic medical care hospitalisation. data Sweden gives EU covid 19 casualties hospitalise elderly almost hospitalised. Yet would also argue education (indoctrination not) given public schools become secondary purpose. childcare allow people work.

A pieces evidence:
- lack concern poorly US performing rest world comes education.
- rich send children private schools get better education.
- push provide better ways support remote learning, re-open classrooms. That's worst part. pseudo state lockdown would continued another 4-6 weeks initially, things would much better now. Essentially, sort lockdown waste time stopped arbitrarily. 

National consumer confidence seems good doubt high Texas. family going anywhere anything. alone. “Endangered lives hundreds passengers”

You unlikely die coronavirus. survival rate like 99% offended people wear masks grocery store public venues. plain selfishness arrogance. need punish people, including Ted Cruz. Pox pox god! mean, super rich *are* part wealthy class, so... really? even billion dollars? seems kind far Guys, don’t give 2020 ideas. News needs air stories like this. again, many younger people actually pay attention current events. know, need get sociologists this, I'm similar experience NY. wonder additional difference culture dictates comfort masks- something along lines NYers northerners stereotypically distant distrusting something masks challenge that, southerners need see other's faces trust get along. Haha edited posting... Yes also warnings DK time. though bit unclear gave warnings know real vaccine yet right? mean tests? much selflessness scientific cause...

Classic myocarditis typically easy identify autopsies, pathologists say. occurs body perceives tissue foreign attacks it. situation, would large dead zones heart, muscle cells known myocytes would surrounded infection-fighting cells known lymphocytes. autopsy samples taken far, dead myocytes surrounded lymphocytes — leaving researchers scratching heads.

Fowkes, Mount Sinai, colleague, Clare Bryce, whose work 25 hearts published online yet peer reviewed, said saw “very mild” inflammation surface heart nothing looked like myocarditis.

NYU Langone’s Rapkiewicz, studied seven hearts, struck abundance heart rare cells called megakaryocytes. cells, produce platelets control clotting, typically exist bone marrow lungs. went back lung samples coronavirus patients, discovered cells plentiful there, too.

“I could remember case saw that,” said. “It remarkable heart.”

Vander Heide, LSU, reported preliminary findings 10 patients April in-depth paper case studies review journal, explained “when look covid heart, don’t see you’d expect.”

He said couple patients performed autopsies gone cardiac arrest hospital, examined them, primary damage lungs — heart. Sweden shutdown kept primary schools open higher infection among teachers among general populace

How know? Testing beyond severe symptoms introduced mid May. metric anyone trusts registered deaths Sweden clear winner Scandinavia. GDP prevent us getting absolutely flattened first existential threat system deal maybe worth sacrificing sense community societal responsibility all? anti-mask (also anti-brain) people long. Theyre sharpest tools box lightest feet. hate say it, insist.. good riddance. Go MURICA! pandemic record breaking without us! immune compromised online classes only. Like grandma, risk make informed decision care team managing risks. privatize say it’s best thing ever Florida moms like, worry kids going Disney!  would early warning system do? months people still going pool parties! US much worse communitz spread going right now, maybe that? think anti government rebel mentality overall here, undoing. baffling, holy fuck. This. girlfriend friends moved teach Valley, later Austin. turned 30 last year quit teaching several years ago, maybe 10 friends started teachers two still it, they're private schools now.

When first left teaching doubled salary entry level tech support provider education software company making would topped according teacher pay schedule. masters moved onto things. Also, man clearly explained essential worker take seat. businesses extremely high bar entry get away much rubbish seems. agree saying buy derogatory call people ""scabs"" 

Can call someone that, job need feed kids, pay mortgage keep house 20 years, preventing finance problems could lead divorce. 

Everyone different different reasons, someone needing taking job reason called derogatory terms. 

I'm wondering economic interests play would make people want speed decision class learning? Maybe people see pictures wearing masks hugging other?

Or cram bus full people wearing masks. Meaningless. tell us “as long they’re smart” part, trivial. literally point post suddenly become worse growing exponentially virus going away. time face reality. can't hide it, thankfully deadly originally thought. kids need education, thankful going work taking care kids! think washing hands using hand sanitizer soap water available good practice. 

If going wash hands using gloves anyway (which should), what's point? want touch face cell phone personal items opportunity wash hands anyway, right? Looks like new record deaths. According previous high 120 new deaths reported 7/9. That's concerning thing, went thinking respiratory disease virus spreads like respiratory disease really vascular disease impacting **multiple** organs. We're still getting much new information frustrating still see people pushing ""it's big deal, hoax!"" narrative, especially people positions power, like leader country something, example. think far underlying problems address. confidence leadership either party would acted much differently things got bad Western world starting shutting things early/mid March. really think early warning collection foreign metadata showing increased traffic hospitals would started actions.

One piece article get right George W. Bush’s presidency, U.S. Department Interior tested wild bird carcasses influenza viruses along migratory routes. cooperating public health wildlife authorities allied countries, U.S. officials could expand systems include information drug purchases worldwide human-animal interactions variety environments. countries refuse collaborate, data often still collected extrapolated neighboring states.

Pulling monumentally stupid. Even think biased better within power outside. See USSR's boycott UN Korean War great example that. Lmaoo funny think they're actually trying. show Yeah, agreed. wanted make point alternative explanations.  Oh yea, much profit keeping economy functional prefect enemy good. One step time. read quote? Covid flu lmao. correct take.  investigation take 10 seconds. wearing mask not? Done. don’t work well upper respiratory tract anyway

Explain further? I’m sorry, info wrong. House pass act. Senate voted it.  lower positivity rate. interesting hazard guess every parent healthy BMI child thinks. think every parent would think case study, although may information share experience. Bonehead. Fist bump NJ. Keep guys we’re it! totally would already working 'essential' job. Time put big girl/boy pants keep chugging along. virus going away. And, kids need solid education. E-learning cut it. Beat, beat, beat, strawman. Idk kill never alive, least fun. used /s people understand! Well least 30 minutes per hour. Hey yo, Im Texas, shit spread thinks safe go again.  Spot analysis. think pro-mask crowd like others pissed stay home two months see people public care anymore. wife said something lady yesterday hardware store wearing mask. said remark came nowhere. lady's response essentially middle finger said since already virus would social distance Context matters. guess posted many flu deaths per day lol Doubled down? question American reporter. Hold NY going cared ICU without another ward.

This wrong translation. ""Mr. Doom Gloom"" please link said. it’s immediate spectacular, people don’t care. reason many slow-death problems obesity, alcohol, smoking, etc.

It's shame [all mass slow boring immediate spectacular.

ETA: I'm saying entirely wrong. think point correct degree terms general population. think larger factor whether somebody currently profiting cause problem (guns, tobacco...), profit ""solution"" (TSA's ""security theatre""). double last Tuesday, included holiday weekend catch bump  I'm them, take words seriously, situation bad enough is. thing count license. lose that, essentially restart, young enough so, amid pandemic everyone lose job. like gamble, miracle. know fucked, matter do, fucked. fucking tiny chance greater zero ffs.

as turns out, enough scabs in-house People voted selfish coward liar really apex pyramid selfish coward liar party. pay clear identifiable price stupidity. 

Maybe America learn? Sweden remains one countries deaths per Capita US.

Other members select group include two micronations Andorra San Marino, even handful deaths huge impact, Belgium nobody remembers functioning government might look like, UK sick experts put Boris Johnson charge Spain, Italy France (the latter ranked Sewden US) hit hard early on, starting get things control.

I think moral whole thing react slow stupidly threats try play chess Death know checkers. 1) United employees (Republic)
2) used flight attendant. I’ve plenty passengers removed airplanes. Usually intoxication, sometimes belligerence. I’ve never seen shit like that. Something very, wrong there. Usually need call security, escort person plane airline rebook later flight (unless sort crime committed).

I arguing ball dropped happened standard procedure. blame Republic agent &amp; police escalating situation opinion. Also, study Compared patients normal echocardiogram (*n* = 549, 45%), patients abnormal scan (*n* = 667, 55%) older higher prevalence pre-existing ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, valvular heart disease, similar prevalence hypertension diabetes mellitus. proportion males similar groups (*Table 1*; *Figure 2*, *Central Illustration*). Yeah, clearly masks widely worn close someones face long time. I've posted similarly Arizona lately. mean, us knows instantly whether number like ""oh shit"" ""a blip radar"". cases versus cases per million Yeah article shit. wait 10 paragraphs say board authority. put little tid-bit earlier perhaps headline. wouldn’t ha e gotten outrage clicks. Complete lie. house passed heroes act mid may would done exactly /u/spaceandtimes described. WH pu bl ican sen ate immediately denounced it. Tennessee, county held total cases 50 March May. apparently decided over, 100 cases day

Fucking ridiculous Yes, mentioned ""official (underestimated) covid deaths"". Yup. effective vaccine becomes widely available soon, lot people likely died unnecessarily. vaccine proves elusive impossible, moved timing up. 

They’re “wrong” either way, made reasonable risk/reward decision we’ll see plays out. Sure, didnt riots etc thousands show marching together nonetheless 

Hong Kong however, literally months protesting riots...one countries done best overall, right next everything presumably began

Masks usage heavy places US wasted good 6-8 weeks watched virus spread China Italy

A better early warning would helped, better early response would really get insanely expensive private schools wealthy areas. public schools already exclusive difficult even get district. Housing expensive. people go beyond send kids $50k/yr private high schools. Why? Literally baffling me.

You really understand people spending huge amounts money children's success?

Not going weigh whether schools better, people *believe* they're better *have* money, makes sense would willing spend give children edge. ""Gaggle"" right ring it. Texas, Florida Arizona. 3 states Republican governors lapdogs Trump &amp; Pence. wonder there's connection. double standard, hypocrisy...plus can't stand spineless cretin. 

I'd probably gotten kicked arrested forcefully assaulting mask. lodged trachea getting virus, right?! wait baby get mother it? understand pregnancy works. least one foreigner beaten wearing one: harassed: http://archive.vn/YtTu0

Could masks excuse racism, knows. Agreed there, article pretty tame. aligns trend keep noticing, though. 

News sites obviously favor negative news, seeing Sweden critical news time become tame, past-focused, points towards things continuously getting better Sweden. They're basically running bad things report on, go tame news recycled, old stuff. Wow, look commenting 1 month old posts. Nice work.  government use reddit informed are... also saw Cruz's ""people"" claimed put mask finished coffee. I'm going assume did.

He also photographed gate without mask. sounds lot like wear one did. Lol low key thought thing haha   No, missing point. [Closing save Look data, people died rate 4x, 5x, 6x, 10x quarantine. July averaging 554 deaths day. ""meat"" shutdown everyone closed averaged 2322 deaths per day.

Getting infected mean **death**, infection rate growing, death rate shrinking.

Source: florida man ccaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaare. he'll wants, wants, wants, wants! Roads blocked east. Depends province Quebec NB blocked TransCanada Ontario blocked Good luck unions. would think, right??

Disneyworld needs infect every little boy girl florida realizes joke.

This time going fantasy land kids. 

My hometown flooded people think they've already it, assume they're protected immunity mutations virus. staggering people listen logic one crappy MD ignore information rest saying. get triggered like guy Costco. “I feel threatened!!!” like Walmart retail stores. would take literally millions people walking although I’m even sure wouldn’t fire all.

There millions people willing take jobs. Archive [http://archive.is/CEMux](http://archive.is/CEMux) said. They're 2.5 4.5. 2.5 year thinks lot fun wearing 4 year old convinced. far anywhere thinking ahead since US going seeing end anytime soon. Thanks feedback! Teachers allowed 'unions' Texas. 'advocacy groups'. Philadelphia canceled large events including Thanksgiving day parade mummers parade year. Everyone wonders restrictions lifted People hard time sticking Social Distancing, yet living year government quite literally taking away everything fun. basically fun thing walk around. better solution. 15 shootings Monday Full respirators comfortable things wear store general socializing. least two sizes traditional face masks. One normal noses one Cyrano de Bergerac noses like mine. Even swim/snorkling masks fit properly nose pockets tend shallow. prefer learning themselves... C terminal EWR nice, B terminal still dump. ""under construction"" years No..the majority world fine direction wise. America one massively fucking up. Yep! live NYC area...I know atleast 8 .. recovered issues knocked butts weeks. know one person serious long term effects besides residual cough, happen rough go flu. Flying 8 1 - 10 scale 2 getting takeout food restaurant 1 checking mail. amazingly almost free tickets flight 3.5 weeks. I'm probably going cancel unless find hazmat suit get approved boarding. parents generation, actually votes, still thinks norm graduate high paying job benefits stay job thirty years. understand world climb ladder horizontally school =\= job. think us live every day exception, result series unfortunate events bad choices somehow means deserve something (which whole conversation) obliterating elderly? Unless quarantine two weeks things. Every teacher know works second job student loans, salaries way low. 

We attacking exorbitant college prices first. Usually viruses reverse-transcribe DNA integrate genome. viruses this. Cold viruses integrate.

Edit: grammar. read article, even though taken ventilator, still life support, need learn walk, breathe, eat again, die, sister, though 18, bear striking resemblance her. hope die, though reading article, got lump throat feeling make it. reminds much Nick Cordero story...I hope story end way did, feeling heart happen... Democratic ideals believe in? far know, ideals Democratic party regulating corporations, affordable education housing, accepting Central/South American immigrants, fighting climate change. best ideals have. understand actions like June caused large spike July, right? Let’s take nuance conversation either want schools closed killing others. I’m sure don’t think providing family taking care kids make sure get education. suck it’s inconvenience. grandpa died two weeks ago. probably COVID, grandmother disclose test result. grandmother tested positive antibodies, heard antibodies test large false positive rate (up 40 percent). Also CDC thinks possible catch COVID even antibodies.

This brings today. COVID positive family LET GRANDMOTHER VISIT HOUSE. know grieving, we're grieving, better way. Maybe call Facetime instead putting health risk.

But parents said discussion. screamed calmly said concerned health.

What do? wrong? Ok, guy. believe you. going sue hospital? clearly malpractice fraud. contacted lawyer yet? news? 

Because **feels** like you’re repeating debunked conspiracy theory misreporting covid deaths. seems like died day tested positive, that’s likely real issue fixed. 

You actually take hospital court states. could person goes news proof positive covid deaths misreported maliciously. dont think understand. land border that's closed. still fly US Canada problem. state going go opening schools Florida. DeSantis militant said schools state need open 5 day weeks. states seems generally going online interface 2-3 days week person rest online.

My local school district letting parents decide fully online 2 day weeks rest online. I've spending good bit time /r/Teachers seems like fairly popular model implemented across country.

*edit*

[link anyone aware Florida requiring public schools open August 5 days No, developer real estate salesman.

He build anything, financed it.

What more, stopped almost two decades ago licensed name put buildings.

How many times bankrupt businesses this?

6 times.

Why can't get bank loans US? sucks did. I’m going repeat good friend Donald trump &amp; Ron desantis like say, ”It’s fake news!” understanding brain making excuse defending man can't imagine something wrong? absolutely wearing mask get plane pandemic rolling dice big time! You’re getting metal box recycled air ability social distance. Airlines can’t guarantee won’t get COVID. Don’t buy selling middle seat PR stunt. It’s joke. never mentioned school all, mention mask provides 100% protection

From way phrased “question” tell people like like problem, seem see things black white..

I never said affective masks were, suggested likely affective, meaning wearing one smart thing mitigate virus. 

Next time want ask question, try making statement question mark end it. really, we’re averaging 500-800 cases day. It’s cases going Capital region going elsewhere. 

Although I’ll double check Correct - many false positives, estimate number infections estimate IFR. falling scenario, former. precisely CDC recommending using serology tests set policy. Yesway already looked moving easy seems. Sure! 

With rate infected soon, best tourists ever since immune cannot spread virus!

Thanks sharing Llamas, really whip covid’s ass. unbelievable.

Sometimes wish could grab handful knowledge slap someone face they'll understand American Exceptionalism means can't happen here. addition making jobs even unattractive before. PT worked hospital. still seriously would changed careers. Since lot administrative people absolutely incompetent endanger patients staff's safety. investigation 

This news Ted Shoulders still needs one replacing really better though. yes, must resign. I’m Houston saw kids paediatrician yesterday annual physical recommended sending two kids (elementary middle) back school. really surprised. Shocked, like it! person selfish enough go party virus, selfish self centered enough care/not feel guilt/blame dead guy. yeah, dead guy big part death, sick person gets least 50% blame. Strength numbers. can’t fire (well ballsy move). america doubt anyone denies protest cause spreading, push back try blame az, florida texas spike blm. Thats false. caused reopening early. blm protest caused spike we’d see similar spikes Dc, nyc, Chicago happening. That's weird. anyone Fox followed this? ain’t time right wing populist leader, it. stellar performance country envy world. Unbelievable. really sad see. 
In eyes (west)-Europeans USA really became 2nd world country. surprised step notch reelect bavoon go 3rd world country status Isn’t green energy one largest growing sectors economy? Plus environmental impact studies every single construction project basically required. Companies reviewing comply new environmental laws come local &amp; state level. don’t deal line work doesn’t make ‘not real’. Trump shoot 1 person 5th ave? ""leveling off"" Good Philly! hasn't. people like ignorant act like tunnel view issue justify wrongful conclusion.

COVID19 magnitude deadly flu killed 3 times annual death flu 3 months despite safety measures place.

But stop ignorant fools like still use ridiculous argument defend wrong politician worship. virus real, explain hospitals overrun ICU beds?

Like abstract numbers graph math nerd generation climate change anti-science lobbying brainwashed, see people knee-jerk ""this fake!""

But local hospital like ""fuck beds sick stay away"" pretend exist? every urban inch TX. point would guess people know folks extended networks severely ill died this; pretend virus real THERE? Banned flying next flight. Eh Americans tend focused individual freedom good individual rather community. sure exclusively America certainly attitude makes us less likely comply wear mask

Edit: thanks help getting Doubt play Kidney Boy! Sure Americans really fucking dumb.

Wearing mask better not.

So wear mask. Noice, capitalism. confirm whether vaccine effective not? test subjects intentionally exposed coronavirus taken vaccine?  Outdoor dining actually fully reopened Canada due low spread tested here. Physical distancing especially necessary though since people remove masks eat, we've anecdotally servers report symptoms downtown Toronto.

Beaches open, though beach communities wary outsiders since many smaller beach towns zero cases hospitals cope anything small spread. Cottages closed people, cottage mayor's advise visitors locals known friendly weekend visitors normally tourism sustains local economy year. 

Physical distancing measures used well though, always followed protests. 

Physical distancing proper mask use (we've high numbers front line workers catch virus exposure incorrectly taking mask putting allowed virus jump nose mouth -- would 100% virus without mask still safer mask, mask hygene important here) key outdoor events, crowded beaches (especially people swimming, since know swimming mask impacts viability), concerns (again physical distancing, also drinking venues results people taking masks putting mouths breath objects).

Saying masks physical distancing open air massively reduce community spread mean spread 0, though. means Canada reported single outbreak related protests, whereas grocery stores, meat plants, indoor greenhouses, locations credible outbreaks linked them. I'm conservative province premier spoken mass gatherings like BLM, even political bias reporting outbreaks -- data, would propagated massively. 

They zero risk activities, people go aware catch spread virus, isolate best result. People informed small existent risks make informed choices. 

Sports venues open air big concern people social distanced, evidence people stay six feet apart, especially bathroom concession stands require people climb one another, entrance exit facilities indoor, closed air systems, litter food drinks carries high Covid risk. type venue also matters -- hockey starting that's biggest closed air system due cooling refrigeration, whereas baseball would safer entrances exits concession stands. ...Florida special kind messed situation - economy largely based tourism/hospitality, state income taxes - another slow shut may result bankruptcy require Fed level assistance hand got lives..... 

There's dilemma here. economy already gonna fucked matter what. Also, guess tourists going year? Florida, economy broken, cannot handle coronavirus. lot corona = tourism. corona = yes tourism. tourism important, tackle virus quickly, get state, open rest world controlling virus. open want, there's still lot corona going around, one coming state voluntarily. shows bad leadership that's capable thinking steps ahead. yeah, Florida messed situation.  appears wearing human face mask all. Darwin gonna blast idiots states can't control virus.  Yep, exactly. we're going stuck disadvantages nationalized airlines, might well get advantages too. Currently fighting: anti-maskers, racists, police, Karens, flat-earthers climate change deniers. Gotta sit one out. lol. flying American anyway. Can't believe final straw you. compare Sweden's neighbouring countries lock saved thousans lives. Herd Immunity. Vaccine.

Pick one. It’s unfortunate reality can’t cake eat too. 

I’ve socially distancing past 4 months it’s impossible every single person quarantine home indefinitely. 

Masks cleanliness help don’t completely stop it.

I currently live place see almost everyone wearing masks. Cases still rising  I’m expecting another thousand cases possibly next week people still continue listen started mentally preparing May people started protesting stay home orders. Signed mine home school academy. 

Personally thought 4th would tipping point far proven true. live work Orlando. much love city, many low-paying jobs COL continues rise year. Police Officers? CDC? Private initiative videotaping Drs? plenty options really, pretty much already used comes drug trades prostitution. There's whole lot stuff could that, chances are, kill me. go around tempting death I'm bored inside home. aware, course, Dr. Fauci work CDC? it’s like either dead perfectly fine. could critical condition week develop long term health problems. It’s like flu, may die sure don’t want get it. hospitals get overwhelmed death rate rises even higher. didn’t test wouldn’t problem /s That's impressively shitty. I'm sorry It’s funny people think it’s numbers low states. I’m driving cross country AZ Ohio back I’m wearing full face respirator whole time. east go, less masks see. understanding drinking coffee removed mask that. Later wearing mask longer plane. waltz onto plane sans mask. Buy pack n95 save nov actually locked down, unlike half assed attempts elsewhere? Worth sacrificing granny? whats next privatize food drug admin go back every pharmaceutical company snake oiling panacea? FAA everyone riding flying coffins? isn’t good. 

Although decline, DeSantis gonna think Disney right reopening it’s gonna get worse here. 

They need real leadership state need fast.  that's biting everyone ass. No, cannot. used objection, convinced City Urban disease. believe happening grandma mean, facts. sad mad doesn’t change them. positive outcome negative situation. Wow! Old news exciting! Thank you! Death? Absolutely, cloth masks great either. call much bullshit this. There's way lol.  build wall then... Seriously. testament effective state government everyone part slow spread masks social distancing. Proud living New England area =) know flu vaccine 50% effective, right? polio vaccine took decades develop? Better get used idea protecting vulnerable rest continue live cuz that's we're heading. gone path originally, we'd much fewer deaths--think deaths nursing homes that, instead focus prevention, left open even packed INTENTIONALLY Covid patients!! alone probably doubled number deaths!! course sensible labelled ""callous"" worse. Better wailing Karen. countries’ conditions herd immunity way go. Fundraiser? Might want think changing GoFundMe medical bills. kids annual exam done Zoom (something similar). vaccinations car.

It doesn’t make sense wellness exam person right now. going office sick people it.  info breathing exercises? also post-Covid (since February) lungs still don’t feel 100% normal. assured we’re bad Florida it’s going Evers fault. seriously hope rural shave learned get rid Fitzgerald Voss rest next chance get. doubt it. Last week, Oxford claimed vaccine would give 'long term' immunity ( ).

Would still hold true recent news last days studies showing antibodies COVID patients went away entirely within 3 months ( )? American, noticing situations like this. recent article happening Ireland ( ) 

As commented there, think aware. think because, ""It’s easier ask forgiveness get permission"" many us selfish Aholes. lag-time deaths Florida, death curve matching positive case curve mid-june. 

Let's hope really gotten better treating it, otherwise deaths per day going increasing around 400% mid-August. don’t know; that’s thought Level 4 basically was, like similar snow emergency 3. Masks mandated county people still aren’t wearing properly though seeing them. guess it’s ultimately DeWine health department? Typically schools little funding federal level. certain schools exceptions? never happen people benefit current system ones change it. Yes, can't shut up. silence CDC byproduct shut information fauci getting. what's scary Louisiana one hardest hit early on! outpaced NY while, think. all. However, truly believe highly unlikely majority people get reinfected 3 months later. Yep fixed. really, really thought line conservatives would refuse cross. really, really thought global fucking panedmic something criticize bid create ""them vs us"" narrative. 

But guess many people think bloody earth flat America, nothing surprise me.... So? Luxembourg Switzerland become virus free? Poor countries can't? even arguing now? Malaysia rich? Well duh!!! virus gone ppl actually afraid, actually wear masks go gyms pools even though opened. Unlike ""first world countries"" huge death count, lots money ""clean roads"", zero fucking education. go day Gavin Carlson. starting economic facts now. they're breathing hard. met Tavern League yet? Even bat restaurant seem sort sway non industry business owners. I'm surprised WI GOP started suing cities counties requiring masks yet. That's antibody tests seeming indicate. titer decreasing. called lab ask IgG IgM. Apparently IgG going down. 
Until recently shot again. Turned put patient non-invasive ventilation. That's actually true AFAIK. Air condition pulls air sides filters pretty decently, major danger pretty much comes row ones behind. He's taking test again, better come back positive, or... people infuriating circus, CNN points cameras makes spotlight little bit bigger. 

This exactly Trump too. They're part reason got elected Outdoor dining found place outdoor party type thing. bullshit probably illegal current rules. Article people interviewed exceptionally stupid people. I’ve total 0 disagreements customers mask policy, business 300 customers day wide array backgrounds. couple people upset subdue situation basic business sense. Even hardcore it, tell “hey sorry it’s law. understand frustration run business guidelines.” think agree theres China style lockdown, Europe style lockdown, America style lockdown, two three work Lmao propaganda insane big part population positively infected recovered three months ago completely without changing behavior? 

I guess could reasons low re-infection rates :) dirty reason teachers martyr complex. look teaching ""their calling"", ""their passion"", something like that. Teaching important job, job. see bunch surgeons walking around shitty salaries go something else paid enough. wall say eh? Hmm FBI interrogations usually don’t start accusing subject beliefs values wrong. Rather begin expressing understanding they’re doing. mean it’s basic negotiator stuff. thing start way get goal achieved you’d surprised far little compassion change someone. thread posting bullshit? course does, hit hardest beginning. changed course live act, death rate down. 

 states literally watched happened us, still ignored it. point here? ones read r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk visiting FLA, etc., make spike mask hole it. Genius. Surely man late close early open  making claim backlog tests hitting testing capacity? Mr. Shit, meet Mr. Wall.

How focus getting morons wear masks instead giving people false hope? hit NY death rates.. use basis far reinfection likely none extremely rare. people never develop antibodies virus infection likely genetic deficit. However cell memory help person resistant virus subsequent infection. People never develop super long term antibodies past flu outbreaks either. However immune system mass majority people get resistive even reinfected. Law Order thee  awesome dream? Yep, love Portugal US yet corridor though. I'm surprised Portugal US bad way right Yes. like Fauci's expertise subject, needs nut warn American people Trump's disregard safety. love doors it. Cute. I'm afraid get rude awakening proper lesson humility.

Cases still rising running ICU beds quickly. According Worldometers, Florida 132 deaths today record.

Also worthy note. Italy rising numbers full two weeks complete lockdown.

I quite worried things going get ugly. good news doctors learned lot treat covid last months, maybe able somehow prevent disaster. Man, bet generous vouchers lawsuit probably would cost shitloads. Besides compensate passengers answer regulators shipped people packages rerouted would nightmare. need friend talk hit up!! I’ll talk anyone!!! Yeah going total, hope per capita. Forgot China though. That's I'm ideas  Lol stop gap. expect people wear masks vaccine out? Give break Thanks dude. Keep keepin' on. We’re flying SW Friday I’m nervous wreck. I’m already germaphobe really anxious, COVID ramped panic me. live across country husband’s family usually go holidays. haven’t visited since last July, husband’s grandmother poor health, felt like needed go. gets infected, won’t survive (90s, oxygen, almost died pneumonia 2 years ago).

We’re first flight day, bringing multiple disposable masks change masks plane/airport change, bringing disinfecting wipes, bringing stroller kid somewhere clean sit we’re airport. hope it’s enough. plan quarantine 14 days in-laws’ house seeing medically fragile grandmother. That's awesome, I'm glad getting properly compensated! Unfortunately common :(  think meant teachers Texaz old die?  Yes no. assumes symmetric testing across population areas population density. assumptions simply true therefore takeaway ""should"" one way another safe assumption make. country like India get quirky numbers low positive rates simply looking wrong areas....especially really testing begin with. makes comparison positive rates mute. plenty large countries many compounding issues budgets really hammer test/track. that's impacting understanding virus fast spreading. 

That said, US great job. we're also testing crap population compared countries. looking overall testing totals somehow lead indicator fair assessment completely asymmetric world testing. data whack. toss places like Russia government control data countries. interesting scientist worth weight going simply ignore comparisons noisy. run math still need base survive least november, time damage control. ""reese anyone engage basement conspiracy theory seriously??!!?!!? Reeee everyone else want good discussion. Even though every thing believe relies telling believing I'm educated enough made guess this."" infections NYC happened February March clear idea going virus. Due density city subway system, NYC essentially multiple super spreader events every single day even knew virus rapidly spreading. Infections happened february beginning show symptoms early march, turn severe mid-late march, dead april. long term virus, that's something lot people forget. 

The difference though truly aware virus spreading rapidly, clamped took precautions *right away*, resulting infections peaking going rapid decline. Remember insanely eerie videos downtown NYC, complete empty people? seriously people taking it. 

We still ended 150,000 people hospitalized, likely severe damage, 30,000 dead. Even precautions, NYC densely populated city avoid mass, rapid transmission rates. places, slower, steadier build point now. simple, patriarchy much myth matriarchy is. actual patriarchy, discriminating based gender, would men better care that.

Those unreasonable expectations men often come women's standards call patriarchy.

Feminism favorite term lemon. Pump now, dump election. - Trump plan! state left. You. Fucking. Morons. last 7 days, US recorded 435,000 new cases. 

In total, highest case count countries Brazil 1.8 million; India 934,000; Russia 739,000 Peru 330,000. US recorded cases last 7 days Peru total. obviously every country, except listed, also fewer *total* cases US recorded past week alone.

Edit: sorry, saw person’s reply. I’ll keep anyway apparently way beat thing tight restrictions, man. “freedom” shit really impeding progress, follow example countries managed stamp shit flat awaiting vaccination.......But America - never say wrong apparently.....? Jesus..... thought one countries avoided severe lockdown prevalence masks social distancing. “The best safest way reopen schools context low community transmission effectively suppressed broad-based comprehensive strategy”

Where’s broad-based comprehensive strategy again!?! clarify then. many places illegal strike, try organize walk out/etc likely lose job (effectively quitting). positive it’s way Texas, state (Florida), hear types comments lot. see you’re attacking critical understanding. I’m happy discuss I’m concerned teachers, staff, students, families. Different viruses different transmission profiles. hard understand? Fenofibrate-cholesterol drug mean close border south like Canada did?  thing counts proof reinfection?

Do truly believe people cant get twice? Tell it! front house servers went Vegas weekend left Saturday night. Can’t wait walking around work. 

People literally don’t care it’s gnarly ( San Diego ) 

Stay safe :( can’t wait till close restaurants completely it’s worth getting go cook people food. Weird, I'd think people alive would winning strategy, 2020 surprised many ways. It’s really hard teens area. They’re seeing bunch friends following guidelines getting together large groups. Swimming local lake etc. kids right thing, it’s really, really difficult. Snake oil Alternate title, ""coronavirus spreads people caring stupid."" Reading always came easy ..but math I'm legitimately 5th grade level.. sucks blame nursing homes prepared, blame Cuomo pretty much forcing take covid patients. previous nursing home could say, ‘I can’t handle COVID person facility,'” said, although **March 25 order didn’t specify homes could refuse, saying “no resident shall denied re-admission admission (nursing home) solely based” confirmed suspected homes vulnerable community transmission, too.

Good point, thanks Cuomo accelerating process. again, I've already pointed you, New York ""the lowest rate [of nursing home deaths] state country"".

Why post next could staggering number people — 31,911 — died New York, far outpacing state second-highest death toll, New Jersey, 15,229 people died.

They may lowest rate, highest number. Worked well lol. kid would love it. would pretend buzz lightyear face shield. taking mask drink coffee. someone snapped pic. left become party Karens. able grasp concept change time hard you? NY literally reported deaths states keep climbing. people category usually need interact public quite often, means interacting millennials young people could infected

You can't expect 65+ crowd isolate. dependent younger generations always likely hospitalization rate infections less 10%.

You can't know enough certainty state fact, yet act like conspiracy theorist who's favorite tinfoil hattery confirmed.

The one data point article provides another strong indication COVID-19 affects heart serious way, potentially causing damage require lifelong care (based know viruses damaging heart), important information shared. article badly written, like we've never questionable title Reddit before.

All trying maintain narrative virus serious people die people get permanent health issues.  That's dangerous, pointless stage US. Bullshit really need conduct study all, done, since beginning months ago. using UV sterilize N95 country long... long time. said done 8 times mask become unusable, recommend sterilize 3 times. So, 4 uses 1 mask. wearing mask he’s recognized. Unless airborne, shield nearly nothing. Human Ted Cruz wear mask skull crushing mandibles formed connect form face human, unlike mask. Yeah, Early April terrifying! They’re fucking plane. Mask not, you’re getting virus. circulates air. always tatters took exact preventative actions population little immunity, would still see exponential spread.

That case countries successfully suppressed virus, e.g., New Zealand, Taiwan, Czechia, Slovakia, etc. They've succeeded public health interventions. reasonably called insane insanity malicious intent. Damn people Philly going get need beat people damage burn property? Yeah, hear you. That's decision people make, unfortunately. rare individual walk away job right now. Yeah highly allergic sight word ""INVESTIGATION"" 


Was wearing mask?


Was mandatory wear mask? Look ""deepfake"" video technology want good scare point. Could also every country couple rotten apples tend make news often ""Foreigner Beaten Harassed Wearing Mask"". Send test parents, identify quacks, revoke licences, done. really don’t see big issue virtual instruction. Yes school taught different medium. Bad teachers going obvious good teachers produce good grades. miss House Love I'm going bet trump, joe rogan, Tim pool. 


You work retail store going doctors. Lol let guess. think masks limit amount oxygen get? wasn’t Twitter Trump ship side continent? Social democratic separatist would go pretty well California. think plenty people New York died. Exactly! I've lived rural areas. think okay lax social distancing, too, risk less rural areas. Selfishness finest. Yeah, scary thing seeing deaths cases June. catch amount cases? going crazy federal government, entity capable supporting country nothing.

The dipshit charge spoonfed list cabinet members could damage respective departments order show electorate ""big government"" ineffective needs dismantled. saw teachers local elementary school wear masks ignore social distancing drive-by graduation ceremony. 

Some schools really showed students bad role models. read UV light contained chamber within mask expose skin UV. Phillys? Look Texas break record today too. Last week Abbott admitted week going bad. papers, they're calling higher taxes. record phone calls congressmen they're saying ""of course mean that"". may sincere, they're probably small fraction. true all. PEI beautiful. Would love go back listen people unloaded risks decision onto you? board education classrooms getting exposed. skin game. Teachers decide whether return. make Mexico pay it!!

..err wait. “such ignorant statements. embarrassing you.”

Keeping this, thank you! Chilling thought: even us keep healthcare might become unaffordable.
My work last 5 years increased fees 7% every year. bet everyone’s healthcare going going use covid excuse. Let’s hear 30% increase. country’s going hell. either know talking actively lying

""The people gather data relevant issue know they're talking lying, trust politicians businessmen.""

Why people like this? Looks like lack basic critical thinking skills. link article without actually reading it, anything support crazy agenda. Cool thanks. Interesting read however commentary around says simply testing great indicator. country responds tests. Also prayer... lots lots lots prayer. guess herd immunity. Yet completely forgot value American Dollar connected buy provide demand items. people around able buy, produce create demand currencies value plumits. end large portions population either sick dead therefore dollars worse less this.  1. Hospitals getting overwhelmed. Convalescing patients needed go *somewhere* free capacity.
2. Nursing homes could set COVID wings, dedicated staff wings interact staff wings. substantial culpability here.
3. states similarly high rates nursing home deaths, despite Cuomo's jurisdiction. ""About 21 percent coronavirus deaths New York occurred nursing home long-term care facility, **the lowest rate state country**, according Times analysis."" knew dumb &amp; blindly supportive Texans are. many people went high school &amp; work don’t believe virus real think ploy democrats get Trump out. Literally dumbest fucking people Earth. Sure wouldn’t want oppress mom pop airlines... think shines light directly face. &amp;#x200B;

hand washing seems ""go to"" across board.

&amp;#x200B;

**How Fauci, 5 health specialists deal covid-19 risks everyday physically go grocery store, wear mask keep distance. usually go odd times. spend half day alone office, I’m part-time White House. late afternoon evening, I’m finished White House, go shopping groceries, drugstores. don’t disinfect bags. general, take materials bags, wash hands soap water, use Purell, let everything sit day. hate NY August 17 Montana!! Thats happened. Upper Crust (read 'important person') wanted last minute seat full plane asked volunteers first, nobody budged. offered discounts, free hotel room overnight. Still nobody budged, picked someone make get picked wrong dude. Way. Too. Many. Footnote: new government then, maybe. That's Florida, happen (insert next state). American worst. rate even worse spirit. vast majority bad experiences flying American. Huh. can't algebra, accounting. TIL. think us heart pandemic April/May time even sure position masks was. I'm sure has, quality life matters. subjective course. doctors humans can't sure - criterias admission ICU. Even normal circumstances beds resources limited also considered choosing. According read contained way expose skin UV. That's bit rich. People whatever want masks they're using it. usually take mine stretch elastic. Legitimately Ah see, guess I'm little used people dumbasses.

I'm Florida many people around taken seriously yet. Even ""shut down"" people anti shutdown protests masks distancing.

I part try ignore idiots since can't anything them. Going start using ‘the Fanta menace.’ It’s perfect. really tough determine many actual cases based detected cases, since testing inconsistent across country. CDC put number 10x nationwide average, better way calculate based IFR estimates, hovering around 0.4% (based serology), even lower. MI 6321 deaths, would indicate 1.58M infections (more really, since deaths lag infections), 16% population. College expensive afford it. There’s something called EFC, much family afford pay based income. many Ivys top private institutions, many people go full near full need-based scholarships. Public schools already cheap long go in-state school. example “paper packets homework”... don’t see reputable school that. experience education college far nothing insanely rigorous. Yesterday low one labs get numbers time. numbers got combined today's numbers reported today.  super frustrating knowing could better, even micro level work, position voice heard, making anxiety worse. level, knowing say control releases that. case, think small percent us see truth can’t quite let go trying convince others. finally reached point week feel like might jeopardize job, seems they’re choosing blind (or really aren’t able understand, otherwise smart people), screaming never help. hate probably going either see employees die, many sick can’t carry business make changes direction.

As city, county, state live in? feel like there’s hope there. I’d say people work making decisions far smarter average member community. one feel control, I’ve accepted it. simply don’t go anywhere. (But forced go work.) 

Anyway, I’ve decided prioritize keeping job saving lives long-term health, including own. figure I’m without job, I’ll trouble long-term, feels certain MAYBE avoiding least MAYBE recovering fully get sick. many nuts box world? Ah, must Texas ten k recently thats assuming trump get went his, ""i'm taking HCQ every day."" phase. Lmao seeing reply think I'm even going bother. good night, redditor. Thank fascinating conversation. Lizard people exempt Yeah that's true, would good thing. I'm jaded experiences. Taken headline misleading details worrisome. **The number people tested 67% lower cases fell 32%.** deaths also record median age multi-week high 41 second day row.

If true truly frightening. get faith-based world view. Imo, lockdowns work shit hits fan. people take seriously.

Yes cost lives would ideally saved closing shit hits fan cause people take seriously. Thus lives lost long run.

You notice states/areas US taking seriously places already hit hard. 3.5 million cases, 467 millions go.


This pandemic never end. position police unions protecting bad cops? That’s thought trend going upwards average past days that’s article says  🏅 think so. need careful returning citizens bringing back virus. Many snowbirds refused self-isolate. wondering that's many died today, average heart disease, cancer, accidents, flu / pneumonia, alzheimers combined.

Yes, covid leading killer beats entire top five combined. Mental gymnastics: post. saying was, noting common denominator Republican Hotspot CA US. used live OC live south. *sigh* suspending interstate domestic travel states get shit together. Sorry dude. came conclusions. know thats hard imagine.

What politicans following? 'experts'? politicians science people call masks? Accepting facts without actually questioning them? 

Oh guess know everything cause incompetent make decisions myself. Better follow along say know anything else. 

You textbook sheep dude. even realize much need told think.

Ps: like said, see merits wearing sick. dont think idea everyone needs wear everywhere good idea, generally people want wear incapable questioning things. hard see downsides mask wearing oblivious advanced ways people control think control. flown American probably decade. total garbage long time. Southwest Delta way. Imma go grocery shopping muh dick (and mask **ON**) cuz muh freedoms! Seriously, get act together Wisconsin. Still mask mandate? Schools closed currently right? 

In country mask mandate too, primary schools open since may, high schools since June. worked out, full 2/3 months peak (which end march). 

It's closing quickly, opening slowly. country messed closing (we already fucked moment found first case, 27th February), resulting massive death spike. luckily opening went slowly. Almost everything open now, almost 4 months initial peak. we're still seeing extremely low numbers (&lt;100 pos cases, &lt;0.5 pos % test, &lt; 2 deaths &lt; 3 hospital admissions day).

Rush opening state, expect lockdown month later. easy find out, read studies year metas compare list. so, share result here. Get it, guys.

You business customers dead. Im trolling dont know think time read that. clearly disagree abundance supplimentary data points around world supporting papers claims, theres nowhere really go there. good day. point smaller pool \[with potential become infected\] fact way 3 mil pple infected US Imagine tens thousands feet air, look face, nowhere run. They've really cornered masochist labor market US need pandemic take advantage situation. make false accusations invade. long administration charge, never prepared crisis...  submit America enough people/ money/ global effect America unable to, say, pick slack climate change, world doomed.

It’s like climate effects isolated country. echo across globe one way another. problem cheering NY Gov Cuomo forced nursing homes take covid patient

Yes know, information constantly used talking point NYC, tell get news using talking point.

Isn't GOOD epicenter pandemic US reported zero deaths 24 hours? seem upset news. Put fly list  oh no, do. else gonna learn anything? making stupid decisions without facing tangible consequences exactly gone wrong here.   question regards covid testing. wife shown symptoms all, underwent surgery two weeks ago. part protocol requires get tested one week surgery check covid. got tested (PCR) exactly one week ago, result came positive yesterday. However, got tested today antibodies (IGG IGM) negative.

Looking known antibody curves, one would say COVID, least one antibodies tests positive. gap virus production antibodies. interpret results? right bet would PCR gave false positive, prefer play safe assume scenarios  Think it...capitalism finest. pediatricians....they supporting schools reopening bill hours seeing sick patients...They choosing make money health safety children.

If kids home public getting sick...therefore making much money seeing sick kids...this money. Sugarcoating riots again. “Birthday parties”. Rigghhhttt Yup, everyone returning thanksgiving finishes giving everyone else hasn’t already office. Except whole forcing nursing homes accept covid positive patients thing. logical. hope joking....I'm black hip knee. would assume vet would know that. cited recent study showing coronavirus immunity lasts 90 days; could work vaccine?Honestly, I’d like know. New Yorker, take driving trip Cedar Point Ohio without 14 day quarantine way back. People need get educated this. many HR departments running risk management trying appease libelous company. Honestly people need re-educated, believe education, olden faith simply sit Karen's screech 2 hours. Ah, virus go area? silly me... got people listening type stuff, don’t surprised
 Good, stay tf city, tourist plague rats. According Fauci March, people walking around masks. think drinking coffee. matter terminology, think mean *contagious.* Virulence refers severe harmful effects disease caused pathogen are. I.e. MERS-CoV much virulent SARS-CoV-2 (case fatality rate \~30% compared likely less 1%). sentence ""how viruses often extremely virulent *because* they're mostly harmless."" really make sense. think leaders telling country wear masks would change much, unfortunately. Like said, American culture anti-authoritarian nature, lot people jump ""you can't make me"" regardless who's charge. Oh goodness.  Again: Swedish friends, talk weather sometimes. hard understand. 

The Nordics also showing decline cases deaths, EU   What's likelihood tx/arizona folks freak point go close towns guns mode? border closed AMerica get's shit together. Anyone else find interesting since reopening Louisiana death totals top 25 day? 

They hit 25 4 times (June 20, June 23, June 26, July 10).

I noticed similar trend Florida early on, hit 47 deaths 6 times 3 weeks, 5 times 1 week. (April 29, May 9, May 12, May 13, May 14, May 16).

Definitely could statistical anomaly, found interesting. husband going work since shutdown somehow considered essential employee wash hands wear face masks sick.

I'm saying sanitize groceries that's feel please know getting curbside going grocery shopping whole time actually tested negative COVID. mean governor sent positive cases back nursing homes? 6,000 nursing home deaths, that's almost quarter deaths state. Also Cuomo's slow response cost countless lives NYC. 

Cuomo murdered people same. think Lopez seeking console daughter man died home Friday told mother died COVID-19 local hospital day before. Lopez realized already transported daughter’s daughter, appeared 20s, told Lopez father applied loan pay mother’s interment. father waiting approval abruptly “She told me, ‘We getting money mother’s burial don’t money dad,’” Lopez recalled.

This poor guy seeing every day. 22 transports day right now, transported friends' bodies killed ambush gunman. combine high temps cities reopening *this happens.* schools resume fall fucked. Plus pissing match Deblasio right shut NYC cost valuable time.  Temperature main factor. People outside sunny. 19 now, entire sky covered clouds. find single person beach days like existence.... Herd immunity never going happen naturally without massive amount deaths, need give supposed strategy. least got Rohrabacher out. Hate guy. Orange County still pretty awful, politically among things. Like clockwork, coworker’s kids start school aug/sept. kid gets sick oct/nov everyone office sick. Right line [the predictions movie almost like listen facts, reason, experts

...except whole forcing nursing homes take Covid-positive patients thing. I’ve making, giving away wearing masks since late April. back shops.. 11 days long time people sort out. guidelines next useless tbh I’m sure I’m still surprised. Great read! Thanks passing knowledge. gdp drops 41% think beyond recession. Also news:

_Texas hospitals running [everything related Covid-19 treatment]_

|  Guess time thankful dont live area gets much tourism. sayin' average racist? want scba. no, let get it, unfortunately. Also, run dry unless rebreather rig shortest flights.  probably Floridians visiting NYC daily basis happened NYers fled Florida. Hell, amount Florida plates still see daily basis NY absurd. That’s pretty much I’ve doing. kicked off, 2 N95 masks garage DIY project last year. Since it’s impossible get N95 masks right now, I’ve reusing past 4 months every time need go grocery store. tuck away minimum 4 days uses.

I’m sure they’re still peak effectiveness, feel like they’re probably still better standard cloth mask. link doesn’t provide value danger children, transmit disease. Try one - 18 total deaths end June elementary middle school age kids, almost major health issues. drive school significantly dangerous that. I’m sure does. considering relationship many countries fact it’s coming soon suspicious. Saying we’d get anything year stretching it. Let alone 8 months. since left comment I’ve seen sources claim skipping phase 3 entirely it’s getting mass produced. There’s telling what’s right we’ll wait see. I’m putting faith Oxford vaccine one seemingly came nowhere. concern rapid antibody tests actually test antibodies determine they're reactive SARS-CoV-2, rather they're composed similar coronavirus antibodies.

The consequence someone cold caused coronavirus (as 15% colds), may provide false positive types tests.

While they're ""accurate"" determining presence absence antibodies 97%-99% rate, lack ""specificity"" they'll also test positive antibodies.

edit: inflated numbers sometimes added ""positive case count"" states, knowing they're correct. aim bolster belief virus dangerous justify ""re-opening"" economy schools. may worsen pandemic people incorrectly believe immunity virus alter behavior less cautious one, leading infections spread. exactly, statement came county board education binding districts within OC something else suspect American won’t want piss Senator. probably issue warning. Let get miles though I've American times past weeks, flights start announcement wearing masks compulsory anyone refuses asked put one would face permanent ban future flights American. Prior banning him, imagine would ascertain employees actually instructed put on, refused disobeyed subsequently, ignored transgression. Llamathrust win!  Republican Senator grifted way private jet yet... newb. remember: facts logic work people. Guilt social pressure better strategies. sure New York State? need Florida's doctors. guys figured out. would think would share info. Dunno. little flu, bro. ^/s Good bot Seems like arguments driven political spite sound science get it, labeled one side evil and, appears racist.

You listened reasoning, made assumptions.

You preach empathy show zero empathy towards anyone different point view yours.

You make effort understand anti mask crowd, care think, mind closed reasoning.

People like country divided.

You see Confederate flag scream racist instead asking fly it. assumptions facts you. ignore raised see flag weak standing man. (ie General Lee Dukes Hazard).

But fuck feel better screaming racist, response big middle finger discussion takes place flag makes feel.

You ilk, ilk, keep screaming shit never listening.

**Sorry opinion, people like much blame people wearing masks people wearing masks.**

Just white people blame black people committing disproportionate amount violent crime. creating environment leads behaviors

PS, link backed point idk man downvoted, probably means wrong.

I one would really go piece bread right now, would go great breakfast. Texas also can’t grasp idea taking poor habits places like Colorado flouting rules hard work past several months. amount Texas pickups ornery maskless drivers state makes irate get it. cannot open economy without solving childcare. Poor parents work need safe place send children. ever complained ism begins commune, partly fault situation.

Your mind open all. rotted like smokers lung. Yea even 90% trustworthy, shouldn’t taking risk 10%. don’t right enter country shouldn’t risk health nice them. Sounds like want microchip us all, we're you, Mr Bill Gates

/s last Republican mayor Philadelphia left office 1952. Fuck. gonna do, send airplane jail? He's fucking Senator. fuck wants. system totally corrupt. Talk her, let know want see afraid endangering her, respect ever decision makes. needs family desire stay safe, figure accept that, understandable comfortable feelings needs matter matter. I'm sorry loss. Milk Khorne flakes! solid point. do. dm'ed said ""keep up"" talking nation's highest death rate. 

Even deaths grinding halt they'll likely lose thier 1 2 spots. states even half high death rate nearby neighbors (RI, CT, MA) also slowing down.  seems immune strange reason.... like one traits.  virus wouldnt dangerous summer live outside. Problem time inside air conditioning. 
Like watching freight train barreling tracks instead moving way decide close eyes put hands ears. 

You violently swing arms ears, knocking passing nurse onto tracks let Mel-Gibson-in-Braveheart FREEEEEEDOM!

The last thing see blood carnage still sticking train Bergamo New York last thing hear global chorus “jump it’s late!” Oregon checking in. short list business forced shut down. rest basically wanted to. Things recommended never enforced. Even right now, mask policy day unenforceable. *Democratic* Governor, Kate Brown even said won’t prosecute people don’t wear mask. It’s fucking insane here. Everywhere go, people ignore mask requirements don’t give fuck. Social distancing seems like afterthought people. Meanwhile Salem PD full bunch racists cops protecting one another. It’s fucking dumb. Thats post articles Swedes breaking social distance beaches? bit incoherent Maybe that's they're counting on? Sell tickets random online people &amp; angry parents, nobody shows up. Win:win? Agreed. Stay safe sane well, friend. Small correction, Wuhan capital Hubei province. large city 20 million residents, province get point. live area study flawed test everybody. people wanted to. like 20%.

They mandatory tested everybody actual results Yeah, honestly, much complicated that. leaders like money yelled act accordingly instead showing, well, leadership forced. want participate society, one ground rules vaccination. Don’t vaccinate, don’t get part community. want benefits society, contribute society herd immunity host horrible communicable diseases reasonable requirement. always free find different community doesn’t mandate vaccines live grid. Oh go sod off. go expert administration let know goes Rhoad Island got shit together. goes always mask. goes park. socially distances friends. visits sister baby grandson. husband nice home beautiful backyard. sure hell need go mall. *doomed country. Lead GOP conspiracy theorists. 
 
Check nightmare stat
  [Governor Cuomo weekly, ""Who worthy coming New York"" What's wrong whiskey pot 1pm? really drink much either that's bit silly thing say. 

Pot cigars definitely consumed frequently though. clicks = $$$ going visit family NY weekend I’m basically allowed, right? I’ve quarantining planning getting COVID test went..

Or mean long stay house don’t go public it’s ok? trying understand. hear different story critical Swedish people contradicts yours. That's fair, it? rest world Homo sapiens, ""thinking man"" Betsy cares *right* kind children. everything make sure tax dollars funneled them. keep safe.

She care children. actually got pay cut back April.

And business 20%. Best thing get UBI going! Florida too. Hard invest damn stock price keeps going up. bubble, I’m sorry let’s real - many actually afford Tesla? gonna real Snow Storm, mean Virus Storm. That's exactly true, apparently. saw earlier today: Shhh. people want admit developing countries handled better country ever did. Actually... ran XL body bags ICU March. I'm sure Texas too. supplies finite. Insurance shouldn’t tied ability work one. Basically exact reason. think it’s time revisit idea. constitution intended modified. certainly wasn’t designed original form national global pandemics. Let’s make sure it’s strength weakness. Obama built cages

Obama put kids cages

But let's pretend that's ok Trump's policy put kids cages.

Yes get it, partisan push propaganda.

 team bad, team muh fre, cough cough point US regions hit first hit hard (also advanced warnings way - Italy, China, etc). it’s someone else’s turn barrel folks perverse superiority complex. find appalling. That’s all. Better late never. Even now, three examples give, WANT believe mainstream media know research shit three make sure they're true. process exhausting. ZERO faith ""news"" outlets like FOX OAN, moderate faith others like CNN MSNBC. Al Jazeera seems believable days (not surprising since they're child BBC); BBC keeps trying stay centered leans right. Guardian way left still better U.S. news. Radio, flip NPR conservative talk (can barely stand Rush Co. everyone listen opposing side). STAT Lancet good medical news. days hard tell studies pumped pharmaceutical companies politically moved (like new chloroquine study Henry Ford pure SHIT fail attribute lowered covid mortality rate corticosteroids! Argh!). New York Times left leaning always good investigating thoroughly printing retractions wrong. 

Anyway, RANT ad nauseam. spent good part life working journalist later teaching writing critical thinking classes. Watching cry ""fake news"" used destroy mainstream media (sometimes justified, often not... news agency disagrees catches lie mean story fake... Duh) disturbing. I've lived Eastern Europe seen firsthand remnants state controlled propaganda jailing dissidents... scary. Bulgaria's fragile democracy falling apart speak journalists jailed.

As much like good gotcha story too, harmful long term. Legitimacy news sources absolutely essential thriving democracy.

ETA: Recent documentary exploring fake news conspiracy definitely worth watching. pure made BS. Please stop spreading disinformation. Labs misreporting negatives meaningful rate. Look state report lab results. release new one every day every lab listed out. link posted someone misinterpreting cumulative results daily results. low-count labs 100%, total makes almost difference exclude them. happening long time, new. good researching problem solving. 
1. Even meant COVID patients, means regular patients shouldve sent free room COVID ones. happen, need. 
2. per article took 2 seconds find, ship converted able take COVID patients. 
If going argue point find current articles. way blatantly wrong. complaining nursing homes appropriate spot send convalescing elderly, proposal put hotels? oxygen, call bells, nurses' stations, etc.

All things way easier set change entire section already packed nursing home find way block entire section. place set solely COVID patients limit spread. common sense. 

Ironic? Well, already established can't research, can't formulate logical opinion solution, even understand words mean? Logically explain possible. Let's honest, can't. Alcohol sanitizer drys quickly, maybe don’t lick fingers clean pandemic? thoughts CA’s dam broke? Newsom top things early. protests public daily threats Elon Musk etc? hell happened hospitalizations yesterday, change reported? anything western states shut early.  Idaho Arizona others quarantining virus barely there.

When look national numbers, looks like went up, down, back again.  that's reality regionally.  We're still initial upswing west south.  opened fast mis-timed restrictions, I'm positive there's mask usage Boise New York City late March.  even though cases ""booming"" were, there's still 100 deaths state-wide 57 per million v. 1,669 per million New York.

Mask usage be, increasing time.  I'm pretty confident reach northeast's per capita death numbers.  learn enough, like NYC learn enough Europe, least learned some. Wooooooo articles related talk Abigail Disney worth $120 million Jerry Greenfield worth $150 million 

I realize lot money, it’s multi-billionaires need board one, guess.. feels like essential sacrifice anything really chronic underfunding healthcare though? Research aside, trying treat ill. Mayhaps due underfunding education tolerating shit people pull full knowledge might endanger someone else, give damn.

The numbers going hospitals cannot handle incoming sick fast enough. selfish, lazy, dumbass motherfuckers. surprising also increase normal pneumonia rates. Source God remember people saying worse swine flu oh wrong  feel way. family cancel plans april travel meet newborn. straight tell continued travel plans would see matter far came meet her. still try make plans us fly home later summer/early fall tell wont make plans fly COMPLETELY control even means dont meet grand daughter 2 3 years old. keep telling better meet 2 risk losing (or long term health problems) even gets old.

I live hotspot city state trying ignore pandemic altogether. left house since March 17th spent day damn baby. boyfriend one grocery shopping aside go out. wash hands groceries packages day. I'm pretty confident everything right long stay diligent avoid getting it. need go back work soon, means comfy little bubble going pop sooner later. happens hope three us come without long lasting side affects. 

It's scary enough think could catching covid, think watch daughter grow health problems getting sick baby, know could never forgive myself. take seriously her. rest world ignore directly hurts loved ones??? point late. takes little bit common sense see it! 

Sorry, really needed vent apparently lol lost climate change fight decades ago. Seriously, like forty years ago. We've borrowed time ever since.

We've known climate change [for fossil fuel industry [obfuscating issue we've chosen short-term gain long term solutions every time. We've chosen denial.

We deserve what's coming. One city. Must true whole country. 

No one ever write article saying anything negative black lives matter. guys get immense pension make mediocre salary? mean know you’re trolling here, least try stick reality: West Virginia’s first case confirmed 17 March, even Montana’s first case day Idaho’s first case. enough actual failures, don’t make facts. know, I'm seriously getting vibes need go live different country actually cares citizens. *drops mic* comedian? *that* hilarious. Yea first solution ventilators, still important think using lot steroids antivirals shown effective now. Thank you! Cut head correct. Thanks spell check! like victim blame, Brits Spain since forever. threat death going force sorts people tone down. doesn’t actually say weren’t Canadian. Could called “Florida couple” also Canadian citizenship? neither... reputable studies articles concerning safety playing outside sports like soccer Frisbee? page suggests maintaining meter people mask, would still feel informed something concrete one way other. one recommend (that well) take 5 deep breaths in/out ~10 second holds #5, breathe extra deep cough hard can. Repeat 2x. Then, lay stomach 15 minutes breathe deeply, without holding. multiple times per day. 15 minutes part takes lot time (who cares Covid), coughing part painful (during Covid), easy post-Covid.

In addition, also hold breath long can. bother taking deep breath point deprive body oxygen force body make red blood cells. hold long enough I'm taking involuntary breaths, start clenching hands distract myself, feel lightheaded afterwards, driving.  breathe deeply afterwards really open lungs. throw cough well. mainly walks. That’s really main question. sounds great two year rule going impact us actually getting access works. places take cash-only payments. handful lot. Nobody ever traced back cash-only stores. sorry. go restaurants always try tip least twice much delivery need compensated fact want stay house safe.

I'm getting groceries pizza delivered want stay safe, I'm still causing number social interactions community shopping myself. Instead I'm offloading risk onto essential workers. acknowledge that's we're doing, try compensate much we're willing.

Good thing never US... GA here. Shit sucks. Good. Lazy fucks go Walmart McDonald's that. many additional deaths masks caused far? Whenever enough doses mass produced public consumption. I’m sure - possibly end year. Maybe someone knowledgeable vaccine production clarify. immoral put others danger. even arguing it. evil. covid still needs way research far lasting effects. normal. unfortunately adjusting denial. Good thing monster shot. universities this. ain't party like pan-demic party cuz people might drop! [dead]  :( finally understand. Americans scared hospital bed experience relate to. 

Anyone who's laid gurney wondering what's wrong surely would take extra measures return. simple, that's what's frustrating this. like masks. think Hillary would done better job containing COVID. 2 cents. I'm gonna guess massive crowds young people filling bar district liberal city arent part political association referring to.

There idiots sides. pandemic hasnt made people realize that, nothing will.

This fall winter going crazy cold flu covid season. didn’t see “Europe” tag, thought referring American deaths. think wanted they'd lot better PR spin.

They're complete fucking morons around.  Good thing invested company september! welcome. That's what's going Florida right now, perfectly explains low Covid-19 death rate spike pneumonia deaths flu season appears full swing South Florida districts Cali Texas going online only. Others opening late depending situations. bypassed asshole effectively told pres. kiss ass shove money. Double death.

It depends number, jumps 100-200 no

Even wanted call spike would silly. Texas winning bigly! ridiculous, something would expect see happening countries. really hope hospitals continue reporting CDC, like they've always done. imagine administration numbers receive them. 8/15 month away. I'm starting think Elon pure sunshine... people Florida NE told go away own...just one day dissapear Keep wearing mask you’ll meet god soon enough Excess deaths.

Source 2017 claim vs Covid: 1993/2000 claim Sweden:
Press release Statistics Sweden (state  clear solution problem write inevitable demise, answer one teacher show opening day.   NJ saw fb someone went high school went resort Mexico week....im just...im exhausted..... face mask would make respiratory issue worse, god imagine corona would do. 

We refuse making lungs little bad prevent literal death. Obey COLLECTIVE!

Don't question authority!

JOIN BORG!

Trust ""experts"" judgement!

Surrender rights!

Burn heretic!

Bow hivemind!

Or not. Personally, think vaccines good. frankly people uppety ""anti vaxxers"" kiss ass. I'd prefer spend time unvaccinated person demands freedom collectivist simp spending time trying control people's behavior. contract virus via cannibalism... I'm glad well-spoken, mature **adults** positions power.

/s afford lose check. Yeah, bullshit occurring since first acknowledged infections Washington State. Americans busy preparing infect kids; old people go fuck themselves. ask Dan Patrick. Rats basically walking cancers. thing really need treat live long actually supposed get cancer die it. like part lifecycle. Well administration gutting institutions protect Americans day one. Consumer protection first. health safety Americans. treason, don’t know is. literally puts people’s lives path higher death tolls. working CDC, fucked. something shouldn’t put with. bunch bombs would less damage. Al Qaeda bunch cruise missiles would less harm sort move executive branch. certainly achieve herd immunity full-fledged alcoholics go completely cold turkey, bodies shut kill without medical attention. Actual physiological addiction means body adapted system, panic disappears thinks gland stopped working.

There's plenty addictions going cold turkey awful, actually dangerous. Alcohol ain't one 'em. question travelling COVID: 


Me gf's lease apartment ends 31st new place ready August 5th. originally going spend days one parents' places, 60s couple high-risk. I'm also going training dates job end month, assurances it'll follow social distancing guidelines I'm worried going bringing parents. we're kind left choice get hotel 5 nights apartment ready. 


My thinking we're going get room somewhere, might well somewhere new explore bit (by car, mean - go drives around area daily we're running places go). We'd essentially thing we've since Quarantine started - taking precautions, limiting exposure, prepping cooked meals trip go restaurants every meal - another city. terrible idea? something I'm considering? need really gruesome videos links dead bodies freezers hallways lined bodies death, doom gloom

In country that’s obsessed violence shock murder sex drugs rock ‘n’ roll… 

Everyone’s taking cup tea there’s nothing bad see Dr. Birx sycophant    Beat it. graduate student, I'm relieved go longer. Several friends international students facing possible deportation result this. Yeah thats kinda culture indoctrination bEsT cOuNtRy saluting flag long meaningless symbol norhing really. tell corrupt ineffective government be, elect prove you. Ah, yes. barely money buy food fined ""10000"" can't afford face mask.

Also, source, apparently Fines €25 €10,000 imposed fail wear mask, rates differing widely across country, **some states, Berlin Brandenburg, insisting would levy fines all, would rely instead people showing mutual respect wearing them.** states said would allow days grace people get used new rule.

Also, find tension mass surveillance corona authoritarianism Germans sought understand rules – could radically alter social interactions hiding facial expressions – confusing twist car drivers warned wear coverings completely disguised faces risk €60 fine. largely still recognised speed cameras police surveillance. Since October 2017 illegal people cover face driving, veils, burqas niqabs specifically singled out. Passengers affected. sub going tell want hear.

But reality is, 99% country diagnosed Covid 99.6% survival rate (per CDC).

The country isnt going sit inside wait miracle cure may may come.

If wish stay quarantined, feel free expecting everyone want going get far life.

There always dangers world. Telling people way rarely works 

Showing way letting choose best bet Easier opportunity total fascist takeover guess. sick poor fight back. two parallel worlds. One inside hospital one outside. 

It's true. hit hardest (NJ) that's exactly felt like. 

Then there's sureality entire everything became COVID. Everyone says take break it. ""Shut news go home!"" matter though. friends family want know. Everyone discussing it. watch TV commercials reaching ""contactless deliveries."" also want know affects colleagues. affects patients. Everyday becomes something new every day. 

We're learning go along. Texas, Florida, California, etc... benefit hindsight still failed.

If country step up, wear masks, act prudence it'll become *everyone's* everyday life.

Edit: Sorry potential grammatical/punctuational errors. I'm tired. Problem problem wearing mask, probably problem type social distancing lockdown Florida 15k deaths per day? Tommorrow? NYC populated city double second place. might want mention preteens... could attract republican politicians. enforceable. college students traveling home Labor Day weekend? People visiting relatives? nowhere else stay family, US level contact tracing would prevent family members recent travelers going work, etc. think national shutdown going happen, needs come without warning, prior everyone panic-buying everything, possibly getting even people infected. Trump announced EU flight ban march, everyone scrambled onto planes fast could, flooding US cases thanks 48h notice. Wow words! Lol  10% fatal even antibiotic treatment? What’s musk throwing manbaby tantrum like Trump past months. Dude seriously harmed rep soon livelihood became threatened like everyone else’s. Plague concern since antibiotics discovered almost 100 years ago.

It endemic rodents west coast, particularly Sierra Nevada Rocky mountains.

There's dozen cases humans year.  big Todd Alaska western name chosen Boris St Petersburg? Even Fauci takes mask talk briefings TV, talking worst time take off. wearing speaking, think wrong either situation. CDC cut off. They're spending much time looking public health enough getting Donald Trump reelected. government close country, much pride first statements Yeah well I've sheltering place 4 months. got email saying I'm expected continue least January. underestimate greed corruption non-profit organizations well... Oh please. one lib student know? went Georgia vast majority smart logical people. Class even started yet.

There’s lot medical school training many people idea wouldn’t deal with. engineer 4 years job experience make money doctor finished 7 years schooling thousands dollars debt. Don’t worry I’m sure federal government solve problem. he's insult John Kennedys world handle something like though beyond me... scale huge. bankrupt thousands companies taken seriously. Anything less bother, pay fine. That's already Standard operating procedure many companies.

Criminal charges CEOs / managers / directors?

""trump said bad thought okay"" That's start, still lot loopholes there. What’s reasoning Hold Disney then... republicans every age, color walk life though. lot republicans Medicaid food stamps. disaster making, rich siphoning wealth away investing people infrastructures. mean cops holding riots people mentioned holding accountable murder? talking about, cop riots? Time slow testing.  Come back 8/15, noticeable spike, admit I'm wrong.

I'm going define spike one following states 7 day rolling average daily deaths exceeds 2x previous peak March - June: CA, FL, AZ, GA, TX. agree 7 day average doubling previous high ""spike""? Back 2001, awful strain influenza swept college campus. friends coughed blood broke ribs coughing. booked infirmary got reported CDC. day, still vividly remember sample taken CDC rep utmost trust public health system.

Drone deliveries possibility? put outside, Alaska freezer Friend husband set get married Atlanta February 2021. likelihood large gathering safe then? month ago two retail workers shot telling people wear masks. $1000? deported? also take account lack reliability antibody tests. Perhaps back April 20% inaccurate. Hell 25% might inaccurate right now. Difficult take numbers back April conviction. Sorry hear institution deeply entrenched. different. Tell virus selects target based age? We're collections billions cells COVID currently loves live of. Talking ""risks ages"" dumb vector base deciscions of. 

Funny deadly infammatory syndrome killed 100 kids isnt even part equation determing schools open anymore defend Elon Musk reopening handled Tesla, don’t think it’s right sensational either. article says 130 10,000. That’s 1.3%, par lot places. much hope videos like pop anti-maskers angry defiant.  also worked Best Buy confirm don’t care customers employees, margins bottom lines. It’s finally quit, made demoralized. Science, b*tch   alpacas, picture mean. might want look Canada's numbers.

While thumbing nose US, cases increasing Canada

And deaths California Texas despite similar population sizes  swine flu also handled ALOT better Please help. children's future ruined incompetent leadership collective inaction.   heard seven patients trial? Don’t know data anywhere.

Edit - oops! See - 45. Least guys mask mandate. work retail I'm seeing 2 types.. wearing masks taking seriously come groceries essentials mainly etc. act like hoax wearing mask buying stuff throwing parties grilling, Tvs family outings. I'd say decent chunk coming river exercise right wear mask. (we types come due lower taxes think club nicer local one)

I grew mainly NOCO til age 14 i'm technically native rarely cross river anymore. enough cases doctors, investigate every possibility. Maybe one work. 

I expect someone access prescription database major medical center, preliminary search tonight. search database people prescription, see under-represented among covid patients.  Or, search prior prescriptions covid patients, see drug uncommon.

A retrospective study, could useful. quick data-search, would make publishable paper, least.  Please no, got shit control NYC, need stupid motherfuckers coming ruining us again. Christianity — can’t forget that. believe there's good portion US take seriously they're directly effected virus. time think we'll deep. see Jobs!!! /s could make argument breakfast place. 2 eggs bacon toast like $1.25 home. breakfast joint like $10 patients are, likely healthcare workers get severely ill/die too. We've seen China Italy. Good luck getting experienced doctors nurses require years training work, sick dying too. NY blew begin deserve backlash that. also deserve praise correcting issue. One question exclaim stupid argument is...

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Do WANT social distancing necessity? honestly doubt this. Even could get everyone it, masks reduce spread ~60%, need reduce spread ~80% effective herd immunity. No, he's probably still ""pickled"". glad? 3 states account 60,000 total US deaths. remember horrified read needing New York,

I surprised werent pictures New York.

There bunch photos right appeared. almost nothing afterwards. would think big famous things parked outside hospitals around New York loaded corpses, would curious citizens taking photos videos balconies nearby workplaces.

But managed pretty much stay invisible first arrival end March. Chad Ted AirPods beard doesn’t weakness regulations infections Habe seen names list? Elber Galarga Argentina (That's version Seymour Butts means one long dick), Leitor Registrado Portugal, Bob Minion Spain? joke now, massive uncontrolled chaotic governance elected officials time emergency Yep. friend's school hired medical staff bought COVID tests run testing operation. mean like better health care plan?

Edit - English teacher mom would pleased substituted “there” “their.” it’s not, Wuhan shut less half number infections flattened curve reduced number active infections carefully, incrementally reopened without additional surge cases. Seems unfair compare. Yes agree. I'm pretty sure pro anti incapable critical thinking skills. vaccines work? Usually. many accidents however. Dr. Alton Ashner killed one granddaughter gave polio Dr. Salks vaccine rushed it. Let alone sv 40 virus comes monkey tissue proven cause cancer, given 50 million Americans kidneys polio vaccine grown on. make vaccine SARS 10 years think pull safely 10 months? Alright, since we're getting tenuous territory think we'll able agree specific marker ""spike"" is. set reminder 8/15 discuss happens then, without objective benchmark difficult either us definitively say ""I right"". would Americans country outbreak control? They'd probably talking execution time Guantanamo. ""this fine."" Funniest shit read day. Jfc funny Ok good. thought could Suffolk near not! ""other countries"" lol. smart move would keep economy open allow majority healthy people develop herd immunity, mandating lockdown rules small percentage high risk category. idea economy must shut slow spread ludacris. medical facilities point getting overwhelmed like previously thought.

You going force entirety America wear masks go along lockdowns. Well, would get new job type instead going school kill myself. mystery. Asymptomatic someone else.

The anti-mask push strong comical people consider teachers nothing glorified babysitters “liberal indoctrinators” sudden find essential. reinfection possible masks aren’t going cut tbh nice family side re: wanting take unnecessary risks! Fortunately parents (even Fox News watching dad) great wearing masks avoiding unnecessary outings, extended family seem get parents let come 4th. relish seeing others suffer die? tolerant peaceful loving. really, *really* want believe ""/s"" everything happening lately taught people actual thoughts like head. 

But joined Reddit 8 days ago likely troll. fair.. means many many deaths covid 136k. Even many convinced might sound silly genuinely think possibility (however remote) school children follow PPE orders better American population. minds warped yet. Thank you, I’m wishing wife good luck mess. 

Honestly, really proud teacher product public education. absolutely would opportunities afforded without teachers growing poverty abusive home. illusion teachers amazing, good lord... far would say important work.

How libtards cant see beyond (/s) Seriously. time avocado toast expensive dumb enough pay someone 12 dollars toast bread slice avocado. Obviously anything smoke weed play video games. Everyone months, right? 

/s laugh stupid are. Thinking win something short term fact creating nasty problem long term bypassing reports. like put piece paper unpinned grenade pretend there. Here, two free bags vent! 1992, Defense Department investigated Redfield accused misrepresenting effects experimental HIV vaccine, study overseen.

History fumbling ball.  ever worked minimum wage job? lot things OSHA says can't do. Finally something agree on. agree. left responsible complete loss trust media, whole coronavirus crisis. similar thing happened Israel. media managed take nation succeeded bringing case counts single digit numbers, gas light everyone believing fake nothing political agenda fit narrative virus fake, administration overreacted. we're facing even bigger crisis. 

This crisis proves media literally kill harm thousands people interests politicizing issues dividing people get ratings. Well voted 4 1 reopen guess must anything worry about. masks needed distancing needed? Cool! Thank goodness covid 19 situation finally over! Brought knife COVID fight I've wearing mine outset, assure you. that, Trump constantly critical New York response, saying overreacted.

It's absolutely terrifying think may even kind actual federal response January earliest. Short answer is: actual wearing mask itself. Instead, become matter identity.  like kneeling anthem really act kneeling.  using/not using LED light bulbs never saving energy. 

The mask become visible sign identity. someone steadfastly denied suddenly start wearing one now, would rejection values. could never that. make excuses reasons. are. Americans Canada? Canadians Florida broke quarantine recently? jury whether it’s truly airborne agree rest. Masks aren’t close 100% prevent spread crowded room Yup. Borders Mexico Arizona, seeing big surge Covid cases, makes South? Nope Hey, they're trying times something us ever experienced. easy get bogged we're together. Stay safe, stay healthy. agree that, come stop Tiki Torch land. city work (thank God lie here) extremely economically depressed large outbreak. HUGE portion population still certain worse flu ICU's full media narrative. Wearing mask social distancing seem like easy things comprehend. whole experience revealed level stupidity, en masse, think occurred country. half heartedly wish virus would cull heard dummies. Looking forward even excluding antivaxxers society Going sold highest bidder cost passed Americans need most. makes feel better, city/county US, school board voted keep schools closed move everything online learning instead. Sanity reason still function somewhat still. time, that's great news! IFR estimates probably provide better way calculate total cases. put NYC 40% so. stoner anti-vaxxer roommate claims Bill Gate's COVID vaccine kill 10 million people.  US, lasted 4 months. December even 8 months ago.  true. Hyperbole makes bad people dislike like police unions allow crimes continue boycott jobs people tired murdering people streets teachers want risk lives children somehow they're bad guys need /s days. Aye, Dems can't fix majority fucked up.

but become real fucking quiet fiscal responsibility republican office, war going on.  Easy solution (wear mask) complex problem (pandemic). Except serious problem America- Stupidity king. 

&amp;#x200B;

 “I believe life - also John Kennedy states 3rd world status decades now. Yall US-enviers starting accept reality instead US propaganda. better message would masks protect Bill Gates' 5G death rays. Fair enough. That's meant though. Haha much faith society. worry five years now, COVID-19 firmly past economy appears back track we'll basically forgotten everything. We'll still treating essential workers like crap. We'll still downplaying science favor people's personal feelings. We'll still politicizing concept providing someone healthcare. _mY boDY, cHoIcE. dErPA SheRp_ Ok I'm done thread, let's get back thread talking science immunity. 

I expert, rely experts tell believe stuff. 

Studies UK Spain found antibodies disease disappear within months. consistent react coronaviruses. get common cold months immunity goes away get again. 

BuT aNtIbOdIeS iMmUnItY

Yeah, except relying T-Cell immunity get infected fight quickly antibodies made fight disease. critical period spread virus people vulnerable.

Here seems either 

1. understand argument, or

2. sociopath,

because disease spreading COVID-19, proven kill fuck tons people *vulnerable dying COVID-19, common cold.*

That worried COVID-19, common cold. common cold murder tons people. 

This get mixed guy thread, really made person head exists demographic reality. 

Any vaccine develop would confer immunity beyond natural infection seems result pass virus people could die it.

I sure actually agree there, typed **other thread I'm even ten hours ago** seems imply believe getting vaccine created getting life responsibly.

So I'm glad cleared colossal waste space. criteria big deal someone forced resign someone forced office, that’s waiting it’s far late. 

Please don’t underestimate seriousness waiting happen. you’re worried echo chamber, seek sources outside usual lanes, subreddit great place that, also, look scientific studies findings too. Even espousing “herd immunity” type measures still advocating social distancing measures, like Sweden.  Hindsight show us Sweden’s approach works—right they’re issues it.

If you’re like me, turned TV long time ago, getting news variety sources (reading articles, skimming headlines, headlines days suck), supplementing reading primary sources. everything shut, it’s like don’t time. ""nothing see move along democratic hoax elect biden"" ........... seriously though truly sucks im distraught whole pandemic response. New York took weeks inspect retirement homes elder care facilities. got one too! Text people- STOP BUYING MASKS! effective preventing general public catching healthcare providers can’t get care sick patients, puts communities risk! Probably mostly bots. ones buy shit, Fuck 'em. 5 days Director Says Agency Won’t Revise School Reopening Guidelines — Despite Trump CDC changes estimated Infection Fatality Ratio 0.26% 0.65% latest 'Pandemic Planning Scenarios' CDC eliminated first recipient local coronavirus data


Basically, CDC stopped Trump wants, sidelining CDC, accelerating pandemic. Deport back Florida. They're embarrassment.  waiting inheritance. believe crocodile tears. I’m integrating well among Danes. don’t even beer way work morning. 😜 ever said think head would implode disbelief. would quite entertaining. I’m still trying find single thing could lose followers. point I’m even sure taking dump baby Jesus would enough. Yeh thats I'm hearing friends work public facing positions well. 

I know... actually anywhere since mid March. wife work home; ability remain quarantined (it helps actually like other) opted go route given irresponsible people general area. I've talked exactly 4 people since March person, ~ 15ft apart &amp; masked, minutes each.

We using Shipt Amazon everything; curbside stuff loaded trunk (like Max's Meats orders, etc). Everything coming house either gets cleaned clorox wipes, bleach peroxide mix , sets quarantine 4 days goes UVC Sterilization Cabinet. got routines onerous sounds really. mild inconvenience point. 

We planned loosening bit summer; given seeing locally case wise - wait reassess September instead. people need party? must people college partied nightly people like toiled young lives away library studying instead went 2/week instead. There’s zero discipline self control going here.   somebody please think children?! still bullshit excuse WHO, CDC, whatever.

You mean actual all, noticed every country that's multiple waves, second wave smaller first?

No one actual second wave yet. parts US currently experience outbreaks never first course, ""experts"" say people develop immunity virus. Sure, thousand people gotten twice more

Now making shit think people tried before?

Do know anything history pandemics? yes, tried. [And yes, works.] Capitalism babayyyy yell fiscal responsibility Honestly, way make go 2 years many stubborn donkeys afraid take vaccine kind hypnotizing microchip thingy. Keep thinking that...


Had prostate cancer 2 years ago, major surgery, believe me, tested system.


Perfect care, accounts. 


Two months get biopsy, 3 get surgery. 


Anyway thought last 4 months would proven something Americans thought system superior, ok...


Keep thinking that... governor state 25k deaths worshipped media hero role model... FWIW Mark Cuban thinks vaccine widely available US Thanksgiving. Nothing worse ""outsider"" candidate becoming known quantity. remember little boy came saved money buy videogame wanted, figure tax, cashier chick adjusted price kid. immediately fired. countries prioritized social distracting. That's best way catch it. reducing social distancing introducing masks mitigation. Masks impact prevention, let's pretend silver bullet. Scotland got single figure cases zero death days, without masks. bringing socially distant. clamour masks America hilarious weak barrier compared hygiene keeping 2m apart lockdown. experience, ever since started wearing masks social distancing gone window, think government right hold mandating risk low enough social distancing could reduced anyway. want mention exactly kind people give us bad individuals Canadian citizen, U.S. citizen.*

It’s quite likely **neither** all. It’s annoying reputation tarnished consistently ill-behaved transplants don’t want anyway. Man, really wish Texas picked Skateboard Jones schmuck . thrown jail. consequences following law. Deaths probably end around half mil time get vaccine. I’m you. highly resent isolated months, wear masks, sanitize anything buy yet negated assholes think wearing mask means they’re real American patriots instead naive asshats really are. job almost 10 new cases pop last 2 months**

It large pop place. 30 people working one shift probably. really want get sick. chance literally die, two animals need taking care of. friends close family close dont really know anyone take care go hospital definitely dont money apply daycare place knows long.

I want quit job all, enjoy it, really really wish step away time things figured cases drop. state exploding cases (Florida) tbh, im really worried.

Is anyway get form unemployment rent responsibilities either stepping away job quitting? know cant get unemployment quit job new environment, prove influx cases almost week coming even companies solutions ""clean place"", could accepted form unemployment?

Thanks answers ideas.  “If don’t announce official Covid-19 deaths, Covid-19 deaths.” -Trump, tapping forehead stupid, childish grin face. Yeah thought getting sore arm quite common getting shots. Monday much last Monday it? we're actually managing better now. :) make vaccines sexy, everyone's it. They're cool delicious.  Also cops hate vaccines. Done. Sometimes amoxicillin rash takes several treatments happens injected placebo injection irritation muscle tissues anything placebo. also tried publicly execute Sure Working food industry, there’s still many customers refuse wear mask even though it’s governor’s orders. doubt they’ll make happen. January 2021.  Meh.

It's fine.

Everything fine.

How are? Original instagram post: name Matt Palardy I'm owner Self Made Training Facility Mission Bay San Diego want message get San Diego specifically gym owners San Diego know another gym owner, uh, please share them. Uh, King Newsom decided shut kinds stuff including indoor fitness centers again, based on, know, dont know facts exactly, but, uh, let San Diego everyone know closing doors would love see gym owners take stand. Stay open, um, I'm sure got hit really f*cking hard last time, uh, like pretty much every business owner dewfintely gyms so, know, cant afford again, cant let guy tell us anymore, need think right, so, we're staying open. hope too.""

Key takeaways:

1.""King Newsom decided shut kinds stuff including indoor fitness centers again, based on, know, dont know facts exactly, but,""
 
*Denialism: position reject propositions strongly supported scientific historical evidence seek influence policy processes outcomes accordingly. afraid fake news, conduct research, without bias.*

2.”this let San Diego everyone know closing doors would love see gym owners take stand.""

*Encouraging others take blind stance.*

3.""we cant afford again,""

*Profits Health &amp; Safety.  Adapt, find better solution business offer services healthy safe way.*

4.”we need think right, so, we're staying open.""

*Naturally, gravitate towards solutions fit perspective; decisions strongly influenced cognitive bias, even though may right thing do.* fact think America way better shows don’t understand issue. places great Northeast (and apparently Minnesota) far public education goes. norm especially states highest populations I'm shooting blanks, must joke somewhere... No. completely gambling long-term immunity thing, complete unknown. gamble may pay off, good since give us information need fastest, objectively good gamble.

Regardless, end China Taiwan end looking best. Bless first generation able think form opinion well.

Also give idea always think democrats/liberals people side want things communism/socialism?

Also think it’s education thing even educated Cuban Americans think way? Well first off, don’t know “necessity” requirement controls foreign canadian land owners may permitted country. 

However, assuming requirement/standard, maybe year prior, knew roof year left life expectancy (shingles typically referred life expectancy, I.e. 20 year, 30 year etc.) therefore know roof must replaced. Take fo sho! #bossbabe #blessed You’re something else lol

This adequately explain rule broke post ""high quality."" receive response?

I would like point deleted message, another user stated providing productive discussion thread. appears definition ""high quality"" minority one, agree? Thank thoughtful response. Best luck you. point give minutes give everything.

Same people claim they'd give lives country, willing wear mask Walmart, sure heck make basic training this. peer reviewed. Fuck supreme court fuck residents Wisconsin crying things closed Milwaukee problem everybody else free live life. else people expect waste dealt sedated? Another thing I'd add this, general health differences average American average Swede. want go quoting numbers here, remember correctly, obesity rate/general health average American significantly worse average American.

As someone who's recently tested positive bounced back within days, accredit workout regime (somewhat) decent diet. smoked 10 years quit circa February year shit started hot fan, think didn't, even active lifestyle could helped best quickly.

US nurses doctors highest paid world average. De Blasio consistently denying seriousness virus even March. Sorry one going take lower paying position replace someone making especially part time sure hell working conditions potentially put life risk.  really seem touch reality.

I’m seeing advice UK can’t get virus food food packaging. don’t get is, can’t putting contaminated food mouth, get hands? would know that? far know causes organ damage like 7 months high demands, remember talking people voted Trump president Theres big difference making mistakes criminal negligence resulting quite literally thousands deaths due direct order gave... think that's pretty optimistic believe that. think would continue spread. going rigged, yes. I’m hoping larger unions states willing step people can’t legally strike... insane.

Unless teachers Texas say fuck strike anyway ideally get union deserve. 

If cop union teacher. saying U.S. can't get coronavirus control? person culture! Wait hospitals get overrun get triage system factors wealth lives dies. 95 year old terminal republican donor ventilator 55 year old black man stops breathing park outside hospital. like alling something hoax nothing done. rest world stopped laughing us watch us like train wreck fascination disbelief even could dense.

Already there, man. Already there. What’s motivates spread nonsense? Honest question. Why? improvement! Teacher ridiculous. Yeah, americans talking about, live free chart doesn’t include today, Airborne SERIOUS. need max protection catch it. don’t think Covid airborne way tuberculosis measles are. Protests caused net negative social distancing protesting likely remain home time.

Also hard factor spread virus group people mostly asymptomatic infected.

From research article everyone using, study social distancing infection rates May 25 - June 20th.

*Event-study analyses provide strong evidence net stay-at-home behavior increased following protest onset, consistent hypothesis nonprotesters’ behavior substantially affected urban protests.*


*The attendees may selected sub-population younger individuals infected less severe symptoms (Liao et al. 2020) thus may never get tested show official COVID-19 No, obtuse sake obtuse. 
I'm aware 12 months ago one would think we'd knee-deep global pandemic killed hundreds thousands figuratively crippled hundreds thousands more. 
But know what? Tough fucking luck. Sometimes life pan intended, happens everyone us (I'm sure majority us seen plans evaporate last months). that's excuse risk health wellbeing others. Especially things taken care remotely: live digital age Christ's sake - communicating people, arranging overseeing things online thing now, believe not. anti-vaxxer holy shit strawmanning roof New York City largest city United States wealthy city world. annual budget larger US states. local leadership failed people, especially Cuomo started sending infected patients back nursing home. think texture.

The taste.

Mmmmm may put afternoon. I’m virus furlough, could use laugh. “Water, like toilet? for?” Never funny. Surely can't rule outside influences. middle fucking pandemic completely control. rulebook thrown window point government certainly playing old rules. anyone else?  read whole thread still write this?

Incredible, really. something think particularly worrying posted? totally get wholly appreciate it. making wry joke. Sorry offend

Edit: child completely opposed schools reopening right now. Honestly, would regardless risk obscene. one get sick die stubbornness. believe (legally) go school's throat daughter gets sick I’m not. Please send germans Japanese help us. We're upset nonexistent ""Covid parties"" concerned masses people protesting streets.  You’re killin smalls Oh, thank FSM, thought prayers would never get restaurant goers. weren’t them, cheesy bread wouldn’t get appetizer. mean. Wed whole lot governors prison route went people make mistakes rulings covid. might there. Haha right, gotta love it. checking in, Facebook, phones. government trying track vaccine microchip. 🤦‍♀️ help...

But kinda feel many people see mask wearing sort magical bullet.

Even mask laws would lower R0 .5 take 3 4 months US reaches low infection numbers current hotspots. reality even countries far measures (like quarantines, strong contact tracing, enforced social distancing) mask laws r0 pretty close 1. means active number infections substantially drop. Texas 80% confirmed cases around 10% deaths New York had. Florida extremely similar.

I don’t understand logic this.

When said done wasn’t flattening curve?

The curve New York looks like worst case predicative modeling early on.

Texas Florida look like best case.

Please explain. University Minnesota study also discovers water wet! state isthis? state go 6k semester entire region US I'm in. people infected coronavirus don’t understand question? Yes city New York New York State Becoming reality tbh I'm glad read well. done? NYC got wrecked Covid. looks pandemic simply played out. That's it, rename ""Freedom Cough"" we're good! Agreed. send votes try get competent people office. Either way don’t much hope lol :/   mean team went playoffs 3 years straight superb owl 2018? fuck talking about? assume we'll go Llaman? Mnuchin said open basically giving unemployment amounts 100% recipient’s respective wages.

The problem workers probably weren’t receiving livable wage begin with, it’s hard see good. Something else haven’t seen lot people mention “normal” school illnesses add already strained medical systems. Even *if* kids don’t spread Covid-19 severely fear, flus, colds, etc. *do* spread like wildfire. 

For example, last year son terrible cold/flu lasted week. Thankfully, didn’t become life threatening can’t help think would happen got one serious school year (AZ) medical systems already overrun. many elderly young children die able get best care colds/flu take turn worst? know. Maybe part epidemiologists CDC said fully reopening schools high risk.

I'll trust epidemiologists pediatricians expertise virology. daughter nurse NC working covid patients, shit scares me. that’s sad. know kids inconvenient times it’s need do. everyone except landlords. Well barely even get hospital work so.... F’s chat healthcare workers. I'm Canadian. Studied abroad bunch Americans though. European system much easier game. Y'all infantalize students much can't pass course miss attendance certain number times? there's constant HW midterms meaning top game every single class almost times.

In Europe get test end year. skip every lecture, single HW assignment, cram like mad last two weeks year make 4.0 average.

Easiest year life.

Maybe spend time reading world works instead making things head. agree. Rochester city announced last week mandate masks indoor locations. went Walmart last night go grocery shopping pleasantly surprised amount people wearing masks. early days this, going Walmart gave much anxiety ONE wearing masks. hope places across state implement They'll say deaths extremely slim chance dying virus unless 60+ years old. keep seeing ads amazon they’re great policies leadership, still see something amazon often muh unrelenting doom gloom sentiment Canada wants keep border Alot state schools middle America parts west coast run around 3600 semester state. I'm state scholarship paying bit 5k You’re cool misleading titles confirms beliefs. 

No, I'm cool title understand necessarily mean anything - grab 10% figure high. know hospitalization rates 11% people 60, less 1% people 20s, general population infected people much lower.

We ""know"" this, statistics like fully confirmed reviewed accuracy epidemic over. new virus, know, picking numbers agree news headlines equal also ignoring questions study. important many people undiagnosed heart rhythm issues precovid.

If (100+) people issues post-covid undiagnosed issues (which study limit rhythm issues) prior disease, would insanely rare occurrence, especially since doctors created study stupid enough try publish data study obvious flaw process.

It's likely least one person study develop heart issues result COVID-19, that's enough data point - article prove anything make statements numbers, says ""this happened"".

Your attempts minimize seriousness pointless, can't change facts disease matter much want believe.

Even article totally misleading fabricated, many, many reports similar problems post COVID, including first hand accounts problems, point certain SARS-CoV-2 virus damage body systems far beyond lungs.

  Scotland hit fairly hard early on, especially care sector, got handle we've made really good progress.

Couple important notes - Scotland's actually pretty densely populated, something like 80% live Edinburgh, Glasgow surrounding cities one densely popular areas Europe.

Also Scottish Gov't aimed zero COVID outcome successful New Zealand, UK whole still aiming snuff outbreaks occur. Oh, sure do. aren’t overtly anti science conservative shocking percentage slowly shifted thinking pandemic overblown. go back office next month supervisor saying isn’t going wear mask office it’s uncomfortable I’m sure others - I’m frustrated. hate even there. think CDC much room talk, They've become near mythical figures throughout pandemic. Although government Arkansas needs stop political B.S. either deal intelligent fact based manner move way let Doctors handle it. fucking hate leave house much always wear mask still suffer people's actions.

I wish people responsible ones suffer. Everyone voted r u p paycheck social security check whatever assets seized distributed everyone lost job failed school this.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Yeah thing that's gonna fix strike. Exactly thoughts Show that! one anecdote keeps circulating. want people listen, give serious evidence. Unrelated, young Ted Cruz kinda looks like Joji. paper nothing headline. sure right one?

They hypothesize March infections higher mortality existing ""common cold"" antibodies present people, causing immune system try make new targeted ones. hypothesis, claim Lombardy higher IFR areas really backing. importantly nothing reinfection COVID.

I say extremely worrying concerned Lombardy Bergamo doctors disease, since seen longer anyone else. Amazing took Chest Scan diagnose Covid. get feeling know little virus. Even think know, well could wrong. say that. asked question called jackass that's exactly see reading shallow perspective.

But since asked questions, here's another perspective consider.

You got small glimpse teachers around country deal every day, realized life gets real difficult real fast without them. That's reason upset.

You idea child's teacher actually dealing time, projecting upset onto them.

Generally speaking, teachers empathetic hard working people. That's assume child's teacher. 

I'm sorry life experience somehow can't see clearly instead believe believe.

Your perspective childish, word choice... 

Good luck you. look comments defending him. 

The cult mentality strong among people worshiping politicians general population safety well even come close mind.  narrative lower death numbers going fade really quickly, 60-70k new cases day going yield pretty numbers line chance get one. People pent time! No, perfect analogy politically geographically, rings pretty true. like New York France, California Italy, Alabama Hungary.

Some states close eachother idealogically others much apart.

We share leadership real differences. Someone New England likely common someone Ontario (Canada) common someone Deep South.  kind get impression too! Republic Acela brains! Facts go fear mongering narrative? Take downvotes! Tourism, massive amount money NYC, blip overall economy city going fine. There's also quite lot here, just, people want post since entices even state morons come fuck things again.  YES exactly! Yeah didnt even mention days LA/FLA near 25/47 mark discussed comment above. LOT 20-25/43-49 days well lazy. looks incredibly suspicious without evidence could also statistical anomaly. fact is, still spreading. Flattening curve lengthening curve. total area underneath (the total population) always same. New Zealand cases last couple days, check john hopkins. virus ""disappear"" everyone isolates 14 days world... LOL

There true ETA vaccine people truly ""return normal"". 

As right now, virus needs run course get done with, like flu does. Early WANTED WAITED people start dying left right. still want die left right say right. want people die accept might wrong.

Life return ""normal"" herd immunity. people want face head live that. want scared never socialize vaccine ready... that. thought self isolation would magically allow ""return normal"" well... countries listed proving happen. would different you. Yes years shame tactics liberal media Pretty good story statistic backup. get paper is

1. Exposure time important
2. face masks must disease. 

So far heard much story outbreak grocery stores shopping places people spend much time heard bars/restaurants people spend like 1-3 hours inside together.

It makes feel bit better going grocery shopping get cup coffee. since two common. would certainly trouble relating someone South Midwest. love partly fault lol venturing much westside amount people see wearing masks heavy favor mask wearers. i've heard similarly Silverlake Echo Park. However I've heard Malibu OC nobody wearing masks. That's true, 50% false negative rate 3% false positive rate average public school America gets 8% funding federal sources. possible old crazy man charge could withhold additional funding new COVID legislation, little power majority funding. antibody test never used make diagnosis, FDA specifically warns this.

But even testing virus full proof, instance, PCR testing roughly 1 5 chance false Nobody sane wants people die shit. Wtf saying? Also professor Anders Bjorkmanin march 31 ""We could maximum 1,000 reach flock immunity"". (paywall)    
       
Also professor Anders Bjorkman, march 31 ""Sweden disadvantaged horror forecasts, [we ultimately **fewer deaths** happier ""We could maximum 1,000 reach flock immunity"". ( (paywall) )                      
                   
Also professor Anders Bjorkman [""People age 80 3,000 times higher risk dying covid-19 age 20."" ( little [real /s... )

Also professor Anders Bjorkman march 23 [""herd immunity cornerstone infection epidemiology (a cornerstone strategy, never strategy, source saying strategy?! /s) ""Infected children become slightly ill all, transmit infection even less infectious symptoms. **On hand, many children become infected immune, creates flock immunity**, total makes difficult virus continue spreading risk groups."" "" If, hand, allow infection continue population group infection significant threat, school children (who probably sooner later encounter virus anyway), build herd immunity time makes less risky 70 years.""

Now quick, downvote!! Actually lizard people running show behind scenes. Trigeminal neuralgia real health condition would problematic. article: *The two stylists worked 139 clients eight-day period, researchers wrote, follow-up testing interviewing, none tested positive Covid-19 reported respiratory symptoms.*

What mentioned article: 46 customers tested, even though offered free tests. rest declined.

It’s always possible non-neutralizing antibodies could drive ADE fringe cases based animal models data far it’s looking like they’re super concerned ADE. vaccines elicit strong neutralizing response like we’ve seen far expectation they’ll work. Agreed. Downright embarrassing. people liberal friend group feel way I'm loss words. Pediatricians understand child development important virus statistically poses little risk child. keeping school directly hurts development.

This subreddit talks listen experts ignores conflicts beliefs. It’s rural vs urban :( Republican vs Democrat.... [Cruella DeVos](http://imgur.com/gallery/UCeAD9G) There's bunch shills Michigan subs stating misinformation like ""children can't get spread COVID-19, kids need go in-person school!""

Sucks ~~Meanwhile [Trump worn Thank posting article - It’s complicated issue! Second rate game show host retweeted third rate reality show character. It’s they’ve achieved herd immunity. There’s deaths everyone going die already gotten it. Don’t praise New York. They’ve deaths covid states combined. Coronavirus would even terrifying... Fascism, broadly speaking, far-right policies wrapped language left-wing populism. really captures zeitgeist modern American politics. Counties countries can’t even try speed-run herd immunity. Look Sweden / doing. 

It’s crazy hear people mention agreeing let rip community speeds process. still takes 2-4 weeks symptoms death, still spreading even people mutating along way. Natural herd-immunity doesn’t work one, people saying that. south stubborn it’s mostly business owners heeding health Department advice accord. thing would question fight closing houses worship even restrictions easing here, I’d upset lived California recently banned singing churches. NYC did. did. Govt stand LEAD people give $hit something bigger themselves. 

[New Yes, that's thought, idea New York relative rest country besides anecdotal crap. Brooklyn Manhattan plenty idiots running around without masks, travelling different states weeks coming back, practicing social distancing. would time would wish tornado Florida It’s hoax guys. knows covid deaths even real. /s ok dust VHS tapes Dallas SB years 

Again. mean, fatties old people die already Ok yelling though

edit: lot milder nvm prob trying see already asymptomatic case Covid 19. know healthcare workers done same, found antibodies never symptoms. Wish could say Tazewell/Peoria. Still asking customers put mask door 1/5 complain, leave store. prevent completely.

You need prevent completely. Even masks reduce transmission 50% still huge improvement 100% transmission. Odds combination masks social distancing mitigation tactics bring transmission drastically.

Once transmission rate manageable number contact tracing work slow spread even further. Eventually number infected drops low virus dies out. Right spread control states contact tracing feasible virus chance dying own. data started collected March. actually look chart, see last data point Jul 12. Look report, starting page 25. 
The labs sorted high low number tests reported. top 10 labs TWO MILLION tests reported. first lab reporting 100% 457 tests. bunch small labs follow instructions numbers would change total even reported 0%.

Again, there's nothing wrong reporting per se EXCEPT media either stupid dishonest report deaths caused COVID. areas report detailed data, among (Cook County, example) even casual perusal data indicates many deaths clearly caused COVID.

I'm getting vaccine want autism. completely ridiculous, can't even comprehend fact heed international examples warnings, NY went 3-4 months hell states still heed warnings states see cases...now they're hell. national response northeast exploded, we'd nowhere near bad nation. original /r/hapas success stories appealing idea, [it's actually Typical dad ever listen doctors scientists, CEOs? Unless Marc Benioff medical doctor PhD scientist public health expert, cares thinks? take ferry Seattle Disney 25% capacity 80,000 people day open Epcot &amp; Hollywood studios well... Previous presidents ""make"" states anything. True leaders especially presidents able least try make difficult situations like work get people cooperate regardless politics situation would easy nothing political pandemic public health.  Trump done opposite country paying price it.

Just simple act leading example wearing mask would saved lives thousands people week Trump even that. use support masks would meant force states require mask use public would willingly done so. fact Trump repeatedly threatened governors try enforce mask mandate.  Trump wrong every conceivable way.  People general idiots. matter political beliefs. Nope, judge need issue order. State needs demonstrate person danger others came particular state every single response get deaths. point all, even question. understand things. im wondering long term effects death. reading whole post? true. I’m help transition things back sense normal moving forward. long goes proper channels make sure it’s safe effective objections end. Lee county. I'd say see maybe....maybeeee 20% usage around me. Nah, people still it. Money. DeVos, current Secretary Ed, said schools open, don’t get federal fundings...meaning paychecks people board. Oh. my. gosh.  waiting hear epidemiological opinion someone shills marketing software.  fair, people listened public health advice second closures wouldn’t necessary. It’s fault state, it’s fault people ignoring virus social distancing and/or wearing masks. could collectively work towards goal containment good health everyone. applies businesses ignored orders safety measures. wrong. Reported death numbers fluctuate pretty drastically day week due way states report death numbers. look historically, Saturdays, Sundays, Mondays lowest reported numbers due weekend lag (less people working reporting). correct way look 'death trend' 7-day moving average basis since smooth inter-week fluctuations.

The 7-day increased 7 days consecutively. even seen three days consecutive increases since peaked back April. 

To prove this, expect see 1,000+ new deaths tomorrow. hope wrong. Meanwhile, even people actual medical issues, like autism's issues overstimulation, masking up. every single response get deaths. point all, even question. understand things. im wondering long term effects death. read whole post start responding minute saw ""lower deaths""? thing even selfish. stupid. Selfish would wearing mask safety... Well according weren't, course would say that. guess we’re going herd immunity US. Inmate not, confined mismanaged virus would make weep. Openly. Endlessly. scary. city lost one running 37 years, figure probably decided good time retire. 

We also going near panic several local institutions around 10+ sending warning flags need help ASAP may make it. Duh Take yes. Never going back either. didn’t company coming wouldn’t paid. That’s “Dr. Doom Gloom” you. work Surgeons office wish docs would take bit seriously. commute work mail box, family stayed home since beginning this. maskholes like others! Texas A&amp;M Public University way state let public university go bankrupt

Here's tracks private public nonprofit closures US. far looks like Texas A&amp;M safe! Arizona reported extremely low amount tests today well  I’m 18 I’m embrace wonderful business practice selling overpriced education. Can’t wait. /s Herd immunity plus fact Cuomo killed vulnerable nursing home patients reason decline cases/fatalities New York. grandpa’s funeral next week I’m traveling sadly. wish could it’s pandemic much risk entire family together. I’m watching home Zoom. sucks make sacrifices keep family safe pandemic. (Also I’m sure exactly it’s called next week sort service thing body actual funeral burry might end year don’t know). It’s excuse put family like risk like go wedding funeral. Like small funeral social distancing that’s fine don’t go! watch home visit grave later date alone.  know customer base. Wow. everyday discover dumbest thing ever seen.. what.. everyday. Memes circulated widely social media, the false claim that wearing mask “removes concealed carry ability.”
There federal law bans someone from wearing mask legally carrying concealed weapon. concealed carry laws vary, law enforcement officials many states debunked claims, according multiple fact checking organizations.

I realize agenda push, maybe read opening mouth might sound goddamned stupid. I've seen lot people tossing around statements like this. think bit fallacy. much hate guy, he's dumb means. think calling dumb actually lets hook bit, actually much worse that. knows fuck he's fucking care. Fuck Ron DeStantis. miss 0 price? community college price? Around community college like 5k, public college 10k -20k private 30k semester. One social distance bat-hug Wisconsin friend. Wishing peace good things. learned southern middle TN schools opening schedule without mask rules August 3. credible evidence either link. food thought. Obviously enforce want to. likely won't, long enough people obey keep cases check.  Ive never seen slavish devotion stupid man. fucking fly FLAGS dunce. fucking CULT. people I’ve known took gap year (or six) could work full time save money college. Many people see going straight HS 4 year college rich kid thing. I'd taking year long Lowe's Home Depot open many protests too? Almost every one I’ve downtown Denver seen almost universal masking. 1% Americans CONFIRMED infected coronavirus. real number least 10x that. also sounds like capacity maxed out. friend went salon today stylist said going try get tent things outside.....including bikini waces!🤯  Second amendment supporters cult members think every respiratory virus known mankind known transmitted children adults.

I don’t care poorly designed study says. every one those, respond school camp outbreak involving 50-100 cases. it’s safe assume children going school lead larger outbreaks bitchinest! going even complicated China right? want total China number include Taiwan not?

Which ever way go decision someone going unhappy, separate category best compromise solution case. special category exists makes sense put SARs well given special circumstances. can't read comprehend?

I specifically said *reasons* behind protests criticized. expect *current* stay home protests effect spread virus first round *stay home* protests did. 

You anxious blame BLM protests everything see fight had. agenda showing. mean information. rather someone admits fucked tried better salvage someone constantly tries hide facts denies situation saying everything's okay things burning up.

No one's perfect. Okay keep telling buddy 😂  argument parents can't keep children home work particular case also means higher chance abuse due presence around abusive parents. dumb thing , argument reopening schools, argument shitty childcare US. Manhattan Beach Fourth July, people (including family) wearing mask. Strong language, absolutely true. anti-maskers' discussion efficacy, unhealthiness discomfort BS rationalization. told wearing mask protection others, many people can't stand idea something others, good country. That's like socialism. can't stand told something. freedom. They're stupid stubborn, they're self righteous it, like cherished American values. wasn’t Rand Paul Cruz? That’s actually great idea.  Everyone treating like scoreboard watching.  data messed up, incomplete place.  countries barely even testing. Tests inaccurate.  Many US tests results people tested multiple times. 

That said, not, ever said virus isn’t serious.  simply agree lockdown strategies they’ve employed, politicization virus fearmongering sub. Disney rat. care green drug people’s life. CCP probably forced hands HK. Pure Missouri

EDIT: Yes, took 50/50 shot missed, actually Pure Kansas, even apropos. 
But honesty, anyone .....**IS DIFFERENCE??** report end March, Tennessee issued safer home orders, residents managed experts thought would take least month 2 weeks (dropping R (forget which) 1). 

Then opened back up, wide ass open, took shit progress made one worse states far increasing daily cases less 400 ICU beds open whole state. 

At point, rights care anti-maskers corona deniers rights stay far fuck away I'm trying die yet. day buys us little understanding information prevent treat it. Never change, Florida!

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kidding, please change, Florida. Yes. waiting someone balls confirm it. require anything want can't enforce quarantine Let's peel bandaid slooowwwly can. Worked Georgia.

What shitshow was. Democrat nominee contested instead conceding. Great. anyone avoid virus forever. even absent long-term immunity, first ""wash"" cause present emergency subside because:

1) survived first infection expected survive second, and;

2) survive first infection absolute immunity.

The phenomenon analogous shaking tree full ripe fruit first time wildfire consuming hillside first time long time.

Surely, successive washings first. But, magnitude emergency shall diminished. Eventually, covid-19 fade background. 

Remember, Covid-19 mild disease people. Thanks help! want go, take one class? actually take one see like? anyone know boating friends considered “low risk?” I’m trying plan something spouses bday thought outdoor activity like 5 friends may good (renting pontoon boat).

We hella safe throughout whole thing obviously 100% sure everyone else. dumb idea fairly safe since it’s outside? Thanks!

Edit: reason asking bc I’m cautious paranoid idea lol. Probably answering question like gather opinions too! harm religion cause compared virus? It’s pretty successful strategy state local pensions decades now. dont see complicated asess danger schools public health:
If pool children one place, inevitable children asymtomatic spreader parents carried virus pool.
Kids can't separated keep quiet eight hours. infect other.
Then parents anyone else home.

Society totally broken. Public transportation broken. Office buildings, restaurants, subways, working pandemic without endangering others.  Yes I'm sure that's things happened anyone, either died flu war. /s yall drama queens real. Maximizing shareholder value. Yep! Douglas County. family wear masks everywhere. Even outdoors crowded trails. lot people don’t wear masks. get funny looks wearing mask busy neighborhood. makes angry arrogant people are. ...yes. Like majority first world countries. God forbid allow people without jobs basic human rights. appreciate it, we’re jobs. didn’t ask world tell us we’re heroes. wear mask safe thank us don’t need treat you. Seriously? moved February. option work anywhere next year least, moving back home ASAP better leadership. Holding person convention Texas right special kind stupid. Excellent, hopefully people wear them. Opening schools still using kids guinea pigs. safe way open schools, become new hotspots. Exactly, like indoor dining dangerous, indoor relaxation zones dangerous.  

The one pictured outdoors, Disney also indoor relaxation zones. indoor dining indoor relaxation (masks off) zones Disney wants open Florida highest numbers behind 3 countries.

(the outdoor relaxation zones fine socially distanced limit number people able Disney open Florida's current numbers. going close, need least close anything indoor masks off).

So... conservative military bloc draw line response lack thereof Trump Abbott? anyone else especially interested virus study health related major?? Deadass virus taught much  Thanks. I'm relieved. job endanger lives complete dogshit statistic. live AZ exposed virus, yet one know age 60 even week long flu it. Bullshit statistic. Yes, would require least 1 adult stay home day. Many families US option. article literally American politics. someone posted article talking policies Australia Germany people responded content would lashed ever think countries? Don’t say American. Overall, Americans adopted masks higher Western Average, even though leadership didn’t promote it. Certain states though, not.  Show Natural Causes graph. friend pay private autopsy mom learn Covid death (in hospital) Natural cause. hope NY remains way. high faith though.  ***might*** get long term and/or permanent damage catching recovering.

There's need exaggerate risk either. Yes, risk, appear high percentage. would nice *both* sides stopped exaggerating. guy gets it. Jersey: ""we"" definitely paid CCP. Lizard people remains undetermined time. article story, even honest mistake, allows people continue discredit threat. point DeSantis's actions considered criminal forcibly removed post? Impeach motherfucker. TIL:-

First - Ice Hockey indoor location Arizona COVID breeding ground. Probably virus likes cold. Wonder many others caught 2 tested positive, 2 quarantine? ... muh ice hockey?

Second - took getting sick irresponsible kid's mom jumped mask mother Lili added, ""the kids like, ‘This going hurt me.’ Well, bringing home somebody else? could hurt you. know long-term effects lungs. put damn mask on. hard. Put damn mask on.""

Third - lucky parents recovering. one died, would never forgive himself. Plus, could lost breadwinners forced deal wills, probate possibility may need quit school find job support himself, since parents gone. Pretty awesome news

I used think found treatments like could go normal forgot potential hospital overflowing

A really cool breakthrough would finding over-the-counter drug Easier look back look forward quick, downvote!!

I mean, that's what's asked... July, really still think? 

People flood bars thousands people groups disperse apartment common areas/grocery stores/gas stations/clinics grandmas infected... Uh, I'm paying $50/month, getting $10/month per insurance? Thank God Philadelphia smart acting like virus big deal. retweeting people saying everyone lying virus. reason probably never understand people look him, listen says. bad situation, going go away want deal it. could take seriously might help followers take seriously. would better place everyone take seriously. Europe pharmacies lost business: less people around spreading common cold flu, allergies boom spring due lockdown. Hard see GP essential XR. Etc etc guess USA opposite though  L visor mostly protection eyes projectile droplets. *complementary* mask, substitute.

Of course, also seen many people uses visor comfortable, clear makes really poor job protecting wearer others around, compared mask. Exactly! baffled everyone shrugs off. talked parents, incase I'd heard wrong shrugged agreed harsh. Maybe child high energy average, maybe ADD, hes different students. way would send child place going fail every single day. Maybe could voluntarily anex northern states? guys could vote Northernexit America join Canada get health care. think anyone actually believes this.

What \_did\_ provide talking point people arguing bad faith wear mask even government initially said worthless. say secret. ""Caught him"" context means saw unexpectedly place practically (out state). 

I try imply secret. Sorry took way. still Danish happy Swedish coming back... Hmm, hoisting Swedish flags opened border LOL get dirty broken fast, even waste money it. 

*oh wait....someone's brother cousin getting funds, that's why* Praying Panama! proud NYC, beat  agree saying start Meh. want list. Yes, everyone praising New York handled virus worse anyone worldwide. Country Brasil, handled horrible - deaths Covid - - 4,408 3,328 

New York disaster gaslighting say others follow example. Cuomo sucks absolute ass threatened sue states quarantine Ny Travelers, he's exact thing. people without jobs, starve? Ah, yeah that's distinction made commonly things like alcohol sales licenses many years. Hot food alcohol. happened neck? really, conservative problem USA inviting adult conversations Deaths record levels states going exponentially. fucking retarded? live pretty weird hollywood reality TV bubble. again, media stirring shit vs real reporting.  guy even cup coffee hand one photo, photo even full photo showing he's doing.  Another d-bag camera strikes media eats up. 

Wonder person behind camera drink &amp; wearing mask. Anyone else flight? defending Cruz, gotta treat politicians we'd want treated right? Excuse you, jobs gets way rioting. CDC, well leaders parties given mixed signals masks different stages. credibility (as issue separate actual fact masks preventing spread) already compromised. Instead focusing ""on science"" defending point, say, name-calling. point behavior going result compliance, matter loud yells it, often repeats it, insulting name-calling becomes. leaders need put energy convincing evidence data less incindiary remarks. actually lose money overall report Covid cases stuff postpone cancel. Yeah keep there. less Florida gets out, better. shithole. Funny comment. Intolerant people complain. Yep, every 25 minutes so. I'm normally particular huge brand loyalty thing, things equal, I'll always choose Delta. 

My favorite incident planes ATL got delayed due ice..... hour.... HJIA 3 plane de-icers. takes 5 minutes run big jet one those. HJIA normally launches plane every minute. two minute delay every 4th 5th plane snowballed flights started getting later... later....

Anyway, plane left hour late. supposed 1:15 next airport catch connection. got reduced 15 minutes. Delta hold plane 5 passengers connecting flight, main stewardess greeted us bottles water big smile. ""You made it!"" said, runners arrived plane gasped air.

Yes, did. Thanks again, Delta. really good science efficacy masks, surprised still peddling anecdote still since May. pretty good idea effective are, pushing anecdotes makes sound like CDC still don’t good science  don’t slump body ground.. they’ll sealed bag. helped.

But become woefully apparant jumped first opportunity piss fuck economy. save lives, make money... bread come from? mere practical difficulty. comes bakeries, course.

Where ovens grain come from? mere practical difficulty. stones come quarries, fuel comes forest, grain comes farmers.

Where farmers get plows seeds? mere practical difficulty. plows come blacksmiths, seeds storage.

How blacksmiths make plows? mere practical difficulty. fashion metal using tools.

Where metal come from? mere practical difficulty. mines, course. carried earth workers.

What workers eat mines? mere practical difficulty. eat government mandated bread, course.

Really, enough childish questions. worked revolution. matters injustices front eyes - world bread be. fucking joke system is.

Complete disgrace allowed first place.

Good luck there, geniuses like case, I'm sure US fine USA can't homeschool kids? actually kind remarkable amount people said protests wearing masks. almost everyone, undoubtedly made difference.

Agree--I notice lot masks protest coverage see. Kansas, fuck would thought? yep much needed step.  Thank information! hope family stay safe. Abbott makes Xi China seem like reasonable person (with respect pandemic control). really sucks Texan right now, especially city. don’t want die, want protect neighbors, aren’t average conservative bumpkin suburbs. Abbott stripped away power democratic elected officials want enforce social distancing masks roll back opening plans he’s literally taken power away people dying it. fucking sucks. 100k dead Americans protests. think safe say leaders fucked long that. Narrator: vain. 

Cause suck, collectively. funny response disastrous even guys know one guy talking sense reason suffer serious respiratory condition - pulmonary fibrosis, severe COPD, cystic fibrosis etc

Fuck, they'll magically cystic fibrosis Snowflake. air traffic controllers striked, Reagan fired banned federal jobs life. immediately replaced military ATC new controllers hired. Counties cities typically taking seriously, everywhere else crapshoot though.  guess close grocery stores too.   never said “they might well eating inside”. I’m pointing according newest data virus airborne. you’re sitting sane spot, foot two strangers whole strangers pass without masks you’re potentially going catch spread virus rather wearing mask staying 6 feet away others. noticed lines drawn sidewalk outside stores every block? needs space. Even mask you’re right next someone there’s potential get infected. germs go sides surrounding air. It’s worse inside, still happen outside. mask worst case scenario. saying. simply pointing New York reaching daily lows since beginning “Baudo said elementary-age students staying classroom entire day lunch served students ages classroom homeroom”

Yikes even imagine child new ‘learning environment’? absurd. isn’t school it’s detention. TL;DR: YES!!!! wish could cut step family members lol didn’t age well Back November, wearing mask time? not, admission, heartless human being!! basically putting words mouth. ""Sacrificing lives.""

   June 6, though, Ducey preached benefits staying least six feet away others nearly three months. He'd also recommended wearing mask cases Arizonans physically distance.   
  lThe governor specifically mentioned graduation parties June 17 explaining contact tracing process, involves identifying people might've exposed positive COVID-19 case — often group setting — encouraging self-isolate. months months, know anyone personally contracted COVID-19,"" Ducey saidat news briefing. ""But recently, know lot people contracted this. want tell contracted it: graduation parties, private gatherings homes."" drone surveillance private house looks like something Pyongyang matter people think. talking virus transmission. protests dangerous spreading covid, picture can't dangerous spreading covid. picture dangerous potentially spreading covid, protests spread covid. called context concerns. apologize expressing correct order reading preferences. start responding posts reading it? seems like bigger issue. imho. work mine. ONE enforcing it. I'd say 1/5 wear masks gas station. Yeah bad pretending like going back campus, none us able put together classes online format. You’re missing he’s saying. held mask thing, talking social distancing. really think social distancing sustainable life? know it’s absolutely not.

No, said spread COVID too. Learn record think spread pandemic too

I said spread virus pandemic, that's fact. keep mental gymnastics try convince BLM protests didn't, though. Make August 2021. America deserve suspended rest world ignorance we've shown. **Marc Benioff** : since Benioff epidemiologist?

Let say guy one circles egocentric idiot. seems unfair blame traditional religion. However blaming REAL religion: money, perfectly fair. America *used* exceptional country ‘80s rolled around decided stop caring Ok. disinformation you. Atlantic article may fact correct, however, epidemiologists sounding alarms natural herd immunity may answer immune response well understood may exist all.

What you’re confirming bias. models *may* correct. confirmed peer review, remain skeptical.

I posted medical journals well news articles. keep ignoring evidence provided justify selfishness. I’m one mentioned post.

There’s another element you’re forgetting natural herd immunity: hospital capacity. many beds, vents, staff, etc fight thing. Italy state overwhelm many needless deaths.

Here articles questioning herd trying “understand liberal mind”, try understand science. It’s tragic bad republicans it. spread family, children, parents, friends, coworkers, random people street. Sadly lot workers luxury. get spike NYC protests everywhere, like ~350 cases city quite, quite low pop 8 mil. spreading rate 0.9something though, means spreading still, slowly. delayed parts phase 3 reel back. is, seems, consistent phase 2 reopenings returns work, slow spread someone messes up. Early read article 1 person symptoms traced infecting 70 people (not here, somewhere else), possible small slip got us 350 cases. Nothing foolproof. long way were. everyone, absolutely everyone, wears masks.  Eh. I'm taking one day time.

I name purpose, way say something Reddit someone goes ""What, that's crazy!"" look name like, ""NVM, Florida gonna Florida.""

AND yes, considered moving. Unfortunately family here- though, latest situation, perhaps finally convinced move literally anywhere else. Bangladesh? No. Cases rising rising. first day ‘lockdown’ many families decided travel around Bangladesh holiday 10,000 people gathered mosque ‘pray away virus’. Arizonan, knew picture last month. don’t graduation parties July that’s schools begin start next year. 

That said, shouldn’t BS last month either. concerned long-term effects, lead that? Instead led misinformation ""deaths staying down"" boss still tell work crowded office remotely, lockdown. half-assed it, lockdown indoor dining haircuts.   Snowflake? Triggered? Woke? behind lowest common denominator propaganda made stupidest people.

Trump lied. People died. 

“Looks like April, know, theory, gets little warmer, miraculously goes away.”

“We pretty much shut coming China.”

“The Coronavirus much control USA. contact everyone relevant countries. CDC &amp; World Health working hard smart. Stock Market starting look good me!”

“When 15 people, 15 within couple days going close zero, that’s pretty good job we’ve done.”

“Gallup gave us highest rating ever way handling CoronaVirus situation. April 2009-10 Swine Flu, nearly 13,000 people died U.S., poorly handled.”

“This unexpected. … hit world. we’re prepared, we’re great job it. go away. stay calm. go away.”

“America again, soon, open business — soon — lot sooner three four months somebody suggesting. lot sooner. cannot let cure worse problem itself. We’re going let cure worse problem.”

“Easter special day me. see sort timeline I’m thinking about. say, wouldn’t great churches full?”

“It’s going be, really, voluntary thing. it. don’t it. I’m choosing it, people may want it, that’s OK. may good. Probably will. They’re making recommendation. It’s recommendation.” — Trump, task force briefing announced face mask recommendation

“We think states actually open deadline May 1. think exciting time indeed.”

“LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” — Trump tweets “liberate” Michigan two states Democratic governors, offering support protesters crowding capitals opposed states’ restrictions closures. really tell fox news watcher, always pull kind stupidity out, seeing financial disclosures explain got money.

Checking hard average fox watcher though, check they'd need know add. Yes, now. February though. work small town restaurant feel like would ridiculed wear mask. feel much guilt fear whole thing, one around gives shit easy pretend nothing different day day life one around seems care (though wear mask go otherwise- store, appt., etc.) 
People would rather get normal every-day takeout dine-in service actually give shit stay home cook couple weeks.
But instead, people work types jobs feel pressured socially irresponsible (working without mask, practicing social distancing, etc.) rely paying bills. 
Something needs change. HAHAHAHA! think courts uphold eighth amendment days...

Sadly, little faith country courts upholding Constitution.

Speaking 8th, veteran found across state lines medical marijuana, got 60 months prison. ruined veteran's fucking life medical marijuana purchased legally wrong state. Yes, laws, get that, 60 fucking months? already ruining life giving felony charge. Drop duce letting rona loose! Yup, pretty much.

Thank Colorado Governor completely fucked. district plans open like normal, masks “strongly encouraged” students staff. Already multiple parents commenting post don’t want kids wear masks, full stop. Yee haw teaching Texas one making students pay anything. don’t go. *making* professors go back campus. That’s real crookedness. governor sends covid positive patients nursing homes kills thousands process one emulated?  actually got updated email. emergency meeting based county today. School staggered, 1 day one day distance, masks, water fountain turned hand washing stations water bottle fill stations, pick lunch only, face sheilds, gloves, increased cleaning, smaller class sizes, altered bell schedule limit interaction, things. Big turn around original plan governors briefing today. Glad they're getting together, kid still staying home area keeps getting worse. California lowest unemployment payment dude.its even less Oklahoma! lol originally decided health insurance tied employment? system fucked up. Expect high quality /r/publicfreakout footage Texas Karens refusing wear masks. 



Abbott drag state thru hell without compunction.  my, resist ya?! Ladies Gentlemen, got Covid remember too, said something like ""for every confirmed case 5-10"" unconfirmed could throw federal money down. Put sin tax 2% go state level. Point crazy unknown times would giant resource cash. Maybe states could feds customer mark pass us. way. need someone smarter work out. 
Not school problem. You’re talking mountains cash spent it’s illegal. Los Angelino here, county.

 responsible, takes one irresponsible asshole fuck one restaurant. 

One jerkoff per establishment takes.

Seriously , fuck *morons*. really makes sense trying deport illegals time.  Good deliberately killing constituents hear you! much without WWIII home. one place really need peace effective laughed infection/death estimates scientists released back around March high. zero help federal government. 

With different president numbers would fraction were. (Except protests.) Right 'cause football totes spread virus. Oh yeah? know much virology maybe take fauci? get doctorate? Yep. Half us part. half dumbass republicans. shittoheads first, asshole. summed data outbreak excess deaths back normal. know time differences are. Maybe it’s hot enough? /s Don’t act like 6th grade girl deflecting question. schools re-open classes person teachers students? Yes no? 

If cannot answer question straight up, zero credibility. Hah, there's way said that...

*Clicks link*

Holy shit he's stupid... looks like someone’s oxycontin  Heh Rush Limbaugh idiot.

I know we're well confounds one reasons I'm thinking taking family's offer leave country. People cavalier they're buying good smells, staples, useful stuff, investing pragmatic things/purchases/food.

&amp;#x200B;

They're buying candles. Incense hear killing fucking game. They're buying oils. USELESS dog shit. THIS. Huh - thought health care professionals others deemed important government. project boss UK, needed special letter come back Canada (was visiting mom due illness covid struck). That's bunch bullshit. one South wears facial coverings since end April people living lives like contagious illness going around. know surging. schools going partial reopen August 17. crazy sure. don’t see expect kindergartner wear mask day Perfect, I'll watching tonight then. Thank you! :-D  everyone federal government...  Okay guy stabbed elderly guy tried attack cop knife well? think mask issue, guy wanted I’m sure kid socialize school forced social distancing touching. equal kid sit outside friends window “play” together. like; ""What Schools?"". 

Most closed early late March, early April, going online could. recently re-opened final year students could finish exams, yes ""with masks social distancing"" class rooms.

At point resuming rest patchwork process state responsible education system, even University level still unclear exactly what's going happen.

Some said courses need hands education lab work fully online.  I’m Packer’s fan, go right? fucking care floated away. Keep fuck country. borders closed reason. pandemic important self entitled prick checking camp. bad bot Absolutely. could tazed pepper sprayed distance risk officer.

This summary execution. deserve executed? free society, that's judge jury decide weighing evidence. police play role judge, jury, executioner. teacher advocacy group, better nothing, much. float tank! I’m 24 here. friends work service industry expect hangout long don’t temperature. I’m cool. wish people age would actually give shit take action things aren’t necessarily glamorous social media. I’m like 80% sure protests good seen zoomers millennials could post timelines. comes corona, people ages seem largely ignorant America. Sadly that's true. live resource limited world.

It would pretty sweet could apply labor create wealth though. 

It sucks know apply labor order create value. Good thing society values people knowledge.

It also sucks take risks order create value. Again, good thing society values people take risks patient enough wait risks bear fruit.

It sucks use limited natural resources, like land energy, order produce goods. good thing society evolved mechanisms distribute resources people proven capable efficiently extracting value resources. hope mechanisms continue improve. Yes. Even CGI, ridiculously fun watch. highly recommend looking good time, much looking high quality cinema. Good. governors re-open hair salons condition masks required. Can’t imagine it’d help..... Yeah, usually pretty full summer short road trips, usually in-state Chicago Minneapolis, aren’t anything now. Lots walks occasional drive bigger park hiking, it’s crowded. excitement we’ve taking care friend’s farm town 4th-and blast. whole farm full goats chickens people. Pretty blissful, tbh. Money.

So many southern states don’t income taxes revenue coming in. also went Covid budgets deep deep red. 

Without federal help option. Whatever said March soft recommendations. prime minister brought May much dire serious tone. hard recommendations.

The elderly care visitation restrictions effectuated 1st April btw, long virus got foothold there.

And PPE elderly care homes? Yeah understand, everyone keeps making point NE states currently highest numbers despite making huge improvements. awfully convenient forget first US epicenter, pretty much flying blind, figure things own. states hit we're pointing fingers NY/NJ back March April.

Now tides turned, pretty awful see southern states struggling learned anything north. finger pointed south info evidence COVID, still stalling making major changes. rate matter time death numbers surpass northern states unless something drastic changes. isn’t really room science statistics assumptions regarding motives. respectfully disagree assertion. sample sample, frankly, sample size 30% possible participants HUGE. Wear mask. work. Damnit rush fell wagon. better get ass meeting buddy. Nice outdoor convention got planned there. would shame hurricane happened it.

With plenty warning evacuations prevent anyone getting hurt storm - course. 2 vaccines currently phase 2 &amp; 3 testing. also rna vaccines. Oxford one already starting mass produced (though know works) know hopefully week 2 one, wether produced antibodies safe phase one participants. Won’t know probably September actually effective stoping person getting COVID.

More info vaccines good thing people power cant see true everyone federal government using Time magazine source? Good god.

Remember beginning pandemic told masks help prevent viris? changed minds sudden. Hmm

The media bunch liars. government corrupt. wear fucking mask do. We're fucked. one wants take responsibility. end. would say “our country”? Jack coke last idiots. Stay home, wear mask public. Great, exactly need, another way divide people.  union despite call themselves. Teacher advocacy group.

We can't strike, can't collectively bargain, PR stunts hope request heard, rarely are. lol... wife's Australia. hit major talking points big differences there.

But waited long move. Yeah pretty much *had* care, especially metropolitan area probably knew someone personally got and/or died Honestly, stuff like drives crazy anti-maskers/anti-vaxxers. experts twist science, gives easy justification people ignore go gut. Normal people rightfully dismiss advice play safe, skeptical start question trust whole system. think community transmission way high open schools states. However, time right, kids wear masks and/or face shields. Sure, 100% they'll fidget fall off, kids learn use them. 80% even 50+% effectiveness blocking transmission helpful. proof natural immunity exists beyond couple months. really want ban him, would kicked done it. pub stunt. check 4 8 still wear mask everywhere go Wishful thinking. thank loud unintelligent anti-mask minority. going respond?

Im waiting tell wear mask infringes rights next. regions phase four New York’s reopening plan eligible hold in-person classes fall, area maintain daily infection rate 5%, based 14-day average sustained period, said. regions New York currently phase four reopening except New York City, remains phase three, according state.

I think reasonable. also means likely local outbreaks require shutting schools again. balance public health vs. strain families made school reopenings first week August, Democratic governor said. added regional infection rate rises 9%, based 7-day average, first week August, schools allowed reopen. 

New York schools generally start Labor Day, time play with. Honestly, understand states trying delay start school year see get things control. good job swooping granny! PREACH! think Korea something like that?? look mod told part sub would probably get 2nd opinion know could make asthma flare lot worse mask?

What get wearing one. Yes, Biden said call right back in. way, thats reasonable Yea I’m thinkin’ like Big Gulp money brother trainer helped make setup schedule. leg day ride bike extended time okay.

But push pull day need weights everywhere near sold out. Amazon either month half waiting time straight available.

And like said, mentally going gym improved mood allot time, 3 months gym February mayish way less fun motivated workout home ghetto setup. 500 daily new cases statewide schools relatively safe.

Based what?   Finally Governor solid pair. Wear mask.   selfishness they'd concerned health. yet encounter adequate explanation phenomenon. Exactly. Setting aside asymptotic issue, parents generally need send kids school need go work. “Eh, it’s allergies...” Ok, fair enough. unaware of. Personally, never took vaccine might explain why. I’ll keep mind whenever announce Covid-19 vaccine market perhaps ease people close with. Well, end first wave...before there's second wave.

I'm choosing wear mask we're middle pandemic responsible thing do.

If wanted selfish cunt, could chose wear mask. like putting one go big deal lol. mask Uh. Dude reading comprehension.

 Wet: **consisting of** 

Lemme know plan create single water molecule consist water... school nothing on-campus housing comes leases, maintenance, etc. on-campus apartment complex management company would need take company. SDSU say what's lease.

Hopefully, someone right best response ""suck deal it."" Basically yes, idk we're still using ""First World vs. Third World"" considering Second World longer exists. outdated concept NATO vs. Soviet alignment wealth, living standards, etc. ""consequences damned"" long. Wear mask. Mass orgies Cases people. 

This reason number positive tests number new cases Ohio reports day usually different numbers. people live big cities states cost living high, $600 maybe half month's rent. live?  ""You cancer."" 
""Well Dr Gloom Doom, what's upside?"" commentary angered anti-mask advocates, accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask.

I asthmatic cough wearing one pretty uncomfortable. 2 things:

1. cope wear mask
2. go much games friendly 2 year old teenager willing go it. That's it. LOL.

Our daughter typical teenager times actually really great him. thinks wife honestly lamest people ever loves us loves him. good thing theater drama like nobody's business. Well they're using immunosuppressants reason. Also, seems culture simply compatible socialist culture... Good them!  It’s good hear. 

Thanks filling in. Along church protests grandparents late 80's, fat cyborgs(every joint replaced). 😂 I'm 30. want part society. want live wild west. think US ever flatten curve mass distribution vaccine, gonna one big, long first (and only) wave Americans suffer through? choice care parent completely valid, whatever reason. **not** beholden parents. 

my sibs said would help going this, though. didn’t really spell out, did. coming way. Miami Virus

Get it? Yes. Forgot him. knucklehead. Wear mask. sees way save pensions long term...

Oh wow went little darker intended... Stay fuck are. don’t want you! funny major crisis. People said Harvey killed hundreds ruined lives many houstonians don’t quite assume that’s case. Ohio talking about. High school football apex men’s lives there. tests take week... School going work. feel like live backwater shit hole country. Trump disaster. federal response. failed leadership clear Trump couldnt profit disease ignored like Russian bounty. You’ve adjusted it? Obviously fight combat working home, hope it’s long-term post Covid thing me. tips? feel depressed going dining room table couch 5pm I’m done. work pretty much every day, lack socialization / commute break day hard me. know soft lucky job / healthy right now. Nothing Constitution prevents mandatory masks edicts. Hell, anything Constitution demands part protecting general welfare country. Trump playing poker Fauci playing chess. Sure qualified teachers gluttons punishment inner city don’t stay long term... least experience Baltimore.

You zero fucks give qualified still chose teach inner city. Mad respect anyone experience level dedication far long term. dont wanna know cool man. worry it. I'm sure lot smarter know random ICU doctor. /s received job offer retail associate outlet mall. would second job. safe reconsider? I’m kind worried many people went interview today told store one busiest district.  narrative socialized medicine=communism=enemy/end society deeply rooted American psyche. Let's forget narrative originates medical industry serves inflate profits. Combine American Exceptionalism (which almost everyone mistakes patriotism), get system refuses change would mean admitting America best country Earth, sworn enemies things better do. Copy every area society. Education, Medicine, Military Spending, Civil Rights, etc. least conservative bend, things gotten nationalistic criticism American system seen unpatriotic. Lol illegal: refusing service customers following rules

Illegal: assualt Good him. Say George Bush, shoe dodging skills amazing. asking questions felt failing Arizona asking shutting high risk categorized businesses. more. Media definitely took time let know AZ okay handling situation. familiar one mandate come directly governor.

The governor state level official. Read link sent addresses controversy around decisions made hardly convinced they're effective sold.

Who selling masks?

I made mask anyone access google sewing supplies. 

If still don’t understand masks work, Read studies sent. Read discussions fiber count different materials, material type, virus laden droplet size, mask construction adherence use. little bit work. 

The best waffled likely deliberately lied first need masks likely short supply. Look people toilet paper. knew people would PPE. Look feds seized PPE states paid pocket “redistribute” less telling states manage are, mandating wont mandate covid thing past?

At point wonder deliberately wasting time.

Do mandate people remove cars side road it’s snowing there’s plows coming through? 

We’re middle pandemic. strain SARS-covid novel don’t yet know long term impacts. People minimal symptoms long term sequelae. virus keeps throwing medical curveballs. 

We don’t know long term strain healthcare might don’t know virus fuck around like viruses like Dengue fever Spanish flu, comes back kills people survived first time. 

Who says won’t mandate future another deadly outbreak something purely nonsensical belief, held moreso reddit probably anywhere else, outdoor behavior irresponsible beach boat irresponsible if, numbers 10,000x many, protesting/rioting woke cause much blame mask non-compliance anything else. least gives ammo people predisposed believing political move.


Don’t waste time trying get address people’s faulty logic. It’s deflection plain simple. 

Frankly pissing irresponsibility BLM protests pandemic reads disingenuous still nothing say anti mask stay home order protestors. want law, write one, legislatures held

And point is?

This lot pro mask people demanding. people demanding immediate action less due process it’s urgency viral pandemic. seem missed fact we’re pandemic I’ll let one even ask ask question? many years opted personal comfort forgoing mask respiratorily communicated diseases existed?

A) illness prematurely classified solely mainly respiratory illness fact it’s systemic disease acutely attacks cardiopulmonary system respiratory system. Diseases like don’t go around time like flu. 

B) wear mask visit sick people know illnesses going around ie flu season. feel recently exposed virus might spread someone who’s vulnerable take precautions visiting avoid coming space somewhere neutral. 

C) Pull head sand. “just flu” numbers don’t remotely reflect myth. associated medical phenomena. 

Yet evade moral question.  Hey, I'm bastard, wear mask. always happens run tests. solution either let 0.5% non-nursing-home population die many months, stay home weeks get things control. live Chicago family sure doesn’t come February lol. really insane think political party would even spend dollar convention pandemic. Every single ounce energy going toward fighting crisis. &amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Full disclosure: I’m portion sub you’re describing. actual argument COVID happen anyone, obesity greatly increases odds severe complications death

Those ICU statistics actually make sense theory, even though obese patients underrepresented ICU relative general population.

The people vulnerable severe complications/death elderly. Elderly people likely ICU. Obesity reduces life expectancy regardless virus, aren’t many obese elderly people end ICU.

Among younger people, severe complications common among many comorbidities. Obesity huge risk factor severe Covid complications, it’s often comorbid risk factors like hypertension diabetes. drill ICU demographics younger people, you’d probably find much higher obesity 20%.

Doesn’t mean young healthy person can’t wind ICU die. means they’re less likely so. Tim Cook probably lost much couch last week. crazy sister links crazy conspiracy theorist YouTube videos asked evidence.

I get it. goal threat fine convince ppl comply. threat work. Little context: two parties arguing strategy China: one going ZERO domestic case, single case pop up, want local government take action deal woth it.

Another one going LOW case, supportted scientist, suggests people need go back normal life style, use US example (but think Korea would br better one)

If large masses 10k+ people grouped together hours spread covid lot potential options open keep things running country. US Nothing learn US regarding healthcare.

I think interested high density specialists per capita pretty evenly distributed nationwide. example, even bumfuck state like Alabama possesses pretty high ICU capacity, equivalent province PRC would looking pretty grim.

--Dennis Prager alternative literally shredding constitution, forcing compliance end experiment US “democracy”, one way other, even it’s common good. Even works. Basically he's saying whole system must taken holistically. Even though US citizens still giving government shit enough test truth told really conducting amazing amount test day. problem focus testing means they've forgotten test means end. test suppose something result. China's policy isolate every positive case (including asymptomatic carriers) cut transmission chain.

If test let positive cases recover home end infecting family others test nothing.

Wasn't similar situation ventilators back March? Like first there's talk useful treating patients suddenly every governor screaming ventilators huge deal. died one talking turns ventilator panacea.

I think problem one everyone already knows: **no overall plan** see herd immunity article thousands upvotes? ^Psst... we'd help win. 1 teacher going grade 1000 papers help close racial achievement gap either. month tested positive probably related Ah right, thanks buddy!

So actually put use skills learned school, wrong, even go back school?

This man done much COVID-19! man gives hope humanity government officials. would marry hours went ""lockdown"" started. agree this. Obviously hoping deaths don’t go much, could mean treating better early on. Also, yes, could younger, healthier people testing positive (less severe outcomes). Based trend NY late March early April, think kind death spike would occurred least hot spot states, so, me, good news state notable death jump yet. infection numbers states rival NY numbers peak, deaths significantly lower NYs were.

Maybe TN handling Rona well??? sources say millenials end 96, idea. i'm pretty much interview one frustrating things ever witnessed. may personally responsible thousands deaths.  Finally, they're something good change. Hmm, flu cases 95% average year peak Australia flu season? That's pretty fucking astounding. 

I'd interested see cause really bad flu season future.  Work shall set free! Capitalist edition. Socializing outdoors masks drastically decreases transmission risks.  
That said, protests likely contributed least *somewhat*, even little, headline kinda ridiculous. sources say millenials end 96, idea. i'm pretty much worst. NOTHING knew shouldn’t gone yet anyway. People mind numbingly dumb. guy belongs mental hospital. 
That behavior insane.  
If people aren’t going get shit together, truly going darkest winter.  
Ravaged economy, overwhelmed hospitals (*influenza entered chat*), probably least one natural disaster millions upon millions angry people sure disputed election November 3rd.

That's strange, thought would know people now, actually governor kicking ass (New Mexico). brother parents constantly trying get go back college I'm like.... Why? What's point? Pensacola here, it’s pretty split. lot people taking seriously still wearing masks. Karen MD went protests live large city generally 6 feet around us pretty much everyone mask.  thousand people streets.  

Obviously can’t speak mega DC NYC protests. First all, kids gotten really sick. died.

More importantly. parents grandparents? teachers? show symptoms? Cause rona party mandatory Ferguson pretty prominent back Feb/Mar China Italy getting hit hard, think faded public view. projections stats J-IDEA pretty spot though. long Trump tweets discovery? Hell, combine bleach injections like New Zealand time! Suuure.... Even Sweden, antibody testing shown they're still nowhere near herd immunity.

They're also facing worse economic consequences neighbors got control able open back up. fed thing.. Federal government quarantine Florida instead Med school actually raised tuition. It’s control  wearing gloves washing using sanitizers multiple times day causing dry cracked skin.  

I go shop shop gloves on, sanitize gloves shops help stop spread, drive home, take gloves, sanitize hands wash get home. 

That's far fewer washing sessions directly skin. Haven’t yet seen anything positive optimistic about... Actually good amount people Gainesville wearing masks! Especially employees many businesses. NY pretty good, things considered.

Numbers yesterday:

51,687 tests, 557 tests came back positive (1.08% total).

Total hospitalizations @ 792.

10 COVID fatalities.

Around April COVID peak, saw huge exodus state, many residents went vacation homes states hotspots, Florida.

The fear people coming back since situation states staying spiraling, NY well, may bring virus them. average age people testing positive Covid 31. like average age Antifa card-carrying members. Hmmm...wonder is? I'm one getting tested. person developed symptoms is. Sorry hear that. Hopefully things work out. Oh actually much higher that. poll full 30% people said would either refuse vaccine least wait take it. Came say resident one hardest hit zip codes Queens really though Elmhurst Hospital + overcapacity hospitals + morgues going enough warning rest country - heartbroken many states chose go route experiencing uncontrolled spread instead... read article makes lot sense. Basically, protests, non protestors stayed inside. increased cases protests basically washed decreased cases everyone else staying home more.

This commentary one whether protests justified covid. Thanks elaboration. Helpful someone know history particular user. try see way. new norm. try search end tunnel. even tunnel. walked new era find fresh perspectives. Vaccine probably bring end degree, we've through, thing return completely normal. 

It sounds depressing, depressing compare 'the good old times'. Every generation kind good old time look back to, something happens, change view adapt. part human progress, strive move on. Tbh, virus really highlights easily spread, bad hygiene better already, also strangely due political issues.

We part historical turning point, it. part, keep strong adapt. That's makes humans awesome. However drastic changes, course take care mental health too. Know careful ease off. equally tired this, try see happening, degree, feel strangely proud part history responsible human being, silently wait vaccine, return life before, move holding us back.

If ever want talk it, send DM. also friend usually contact rarely, became covid friend. talk least bi daily check remind alright. Also urge people around basic caution, without insulting, low number, forget wash hands once, probably big deal. noticed always works tell condition use excuse important (which true actually). course can. require address, checks, lock hotel room. number things.

We've noticing way normal Summer too. friend works beach shop Daytona Beach said every person coming New York Massachusetts. parts Colorado like mountain towns tourism main source income. Governor Polis tough spot shutting movement would quite literally destroy family's lives. People's lives also destroyed virus, supposed do?

Polis offered mask ordinance unenforceable. think Colorado purple state mandated them. **No Good see deaths trending back down. tells us increase new cases largely due testing, otherwise we'd seeing deaths yesterday today. Yeah, drove Chiefland one time errand -no one wearing mask-, even employees. Whereas Gainesville, businesses require mask employees customers. One reasons might they're even keeping stats states!

Vietnam fishing fields already claimed China. also turned towards US Vietnam War. emerging economy corporations start move stead China. China would compelled take land well reasons.


South Korea thorn side China long time. would rather unified Korea loyal China. North Korea would love involve war well. terrain China South Korea, South Korea able stand alone North Korean Chinese militaries.


Philippines weak target. navy speak crippled army can't really go anywhere many small islands. reason Philippines would targeted simple. fishing grounds would disputed more. many natural resources Philippines like oil metals. importantly, reason Taiwan would targeted. Unlimited access pacific. US bases Philippines target Chinese navy warships suppliers way pacific, like Taiwan Japan can. Invading Philippines made easy artificial islands China already made south China sea. 


The reason include Japan pretty simple. Japan large self defense navy airforce. also well trained technologically advanced. Japanese islands difficult take due topography. Also, Japan gets attacked I'm pretty sure South Korea would probably also join war. South Korea Japan friends, everything better North Korea north China east, west south. sure Japan would come South Korea assistance since constitution Japan military self defense only.

I've slowly come realization past days. yes two children. Explain Yes! see many people still aren’t taking seriously? view actually consistent Chinese people view American social issues. example, US huge problems mass shooting. many Chinese friends see ""Well US guns world yet still functioning society. China many guns we'd control"" ballpark hundreds millions doses per year still need distributed. That's enough everyone. bummer, supposed school shootings now? Sigh. Really? cause good that's BS. headline sounds like excuse truth opposite. I've seen third grade kids lie better that. I'm saying wearing them. government said president wearing one everyone's safety. get saying end day people it. 

But stupidity, ignorance lack caring fellow countrymen really blame. feds everything ensure Tom Brady’s supplement company gets another $1 million. Oh yeah, definitely. Like choose wear mask stay away others. demand allow entry without one bullshit part.

Like, “respect rights! don’t respect yours!” pretty freaking hot Iran then. This. plan hit disability stick. point, going great. likely attend Emory U scholarship assuming didn’t fuck summer shadowing. Already major lines based abilities jobs high paying needed. forget sites used, nerdy high school career counseling put best subjects/your extracurricular activities shot suggestions based high demand majors. Oh man - heart pinched you. wow. Hang visitors stayed en route one-day trip China, **unexplained military business**, way back.

So government basically found secret deal foreign nations?

Well, gonna complain since Covid got found major outbreak, that's amusingly unlucky mission lucky people.

So far, virus seems contained. Wait go upper division classes. Orgo hardest easiest courses. living Maui January two days ago. living San Francisco prior moved Maui January right news Coronavirus first broke majorly United States.

I moved bartend best friend Kihei. bar shut St. Patrick’s Day moved upcountry work farm. Two days ago, moved back San Francisco terrified tourism wouldn’t return Hawaii years experienced 36% unemployment lockdowns. entire Hawaiian economy relies tourism. regulars worked tourism industry, tourists disappeared, would regulars wouldn’t working either. It’s quite pickle, hoped farming would sustainable work there, necessary work community, even farms hurting majorly. Food security island serious issue unemployment high.  What’s wrong article? Many scientists think [this virus unfortunately.

From rooms dry, stale air, Tsubokura said research showed people coughing, sneezing, even talking singing, emit tiny particles defy gravity — able hang air many hours even days, travel length room. Quality education definitely gets reduced online comes play. took summer course required observations sorts. Obviously, didn’t happen. said, things like constitute decrease tuition rate.

Furthermore, however, charges super unacceptable recreational facility fees, among several things. believe someone actually mentioned another comment.

Anyway, I’m tuition decreasing. right now, it’s next impossible get job help pay high costs. competent federal government, may needed lock states other... Imagine commander chief spoke America urged keep calm. Explained serious situation layed plan. strongly urged Americans avoid traveling.
I think general rule country would listen. many Republican politicians would support even democratic president least beginning.
But leadership absolutely trust government, 
were talking banning states.
Coumo's first instinct right.. ban New Yorkers... one country...
Sadly look ways to. market turn little, that's fine. I'm perfectly comfortable am. nice ready something come along. absolutely ridiculous hyperbole. Honestly would love see ICU doctor saying it’s big deal actually backhand compliment, surely! LOL! people can, cant. previous governor Florida guilty commiting largest Medicare fraud US history. became governor fact currently one Florida's Senators. guess point is......... good luck that. Republican voters stupid live. doesn’t test anyone contact him. work around tested daily.

That way look like Mr. Macho, walk around without mask, secretly protected time. set example photographed many times beginning mask. ahh yes! telling pretty please cherry top would make suddenly start believing science? teachers I'm talking anti mask protests. BLM protestors idiots Completely fair though! get wrong, loved time think back fondly many things. Others much, that's part city... also late twenties left felt getting close ""that time"" wanted slow things bit. indeed die pneumonia/heart attack/stoke whatever, confirmed infection. numbers aggregate lie, clearly SOMETHING causing event happen much often. example we've done 45 million tests. half number, half numbers, probably, another half half numbers everyone would saying ""oh well also best test._

Trump, formatting vote Abbot. personally think deserve die ok. could well true. I'm fortunate position buy anything. I'm comfortable am, I'll buy good opportunity Well let’s honest early. might actually true then. It’s certainly opposite now. Make possible. Close streets. business forced close without alternative provided them. government literally choosing businesses live die. Larimer county masks required enter business. fine place along misdemeanor ticket disobedience mandate. Catch who? Everyone behind. Yes, rather odd live global pandemic. Certainly nobody used this. mistrust feel experienced people 1918 too. Turns masks effective though Thank you. I’m trying get dad better wearing mask. I’m sure majority know lot local families get infected many families especially high density areas locked weeks test everyone. wouldn’t say workers live bad conditions (relative home countries) tested one person accommodations test positive. He’s wrong. Fuck anyone wearing mask, fuck anyone wearing one properly matter. nose, you’re fucking idiot also fuck off. shut fuk kunt. disease spreading pig. Watch hospitalizations. They’re soaring well big 4 well many others. People going die. lot them. Lower density. Easier social distance. Texas vast wasteland egoism delusion, people perfectly conditioned politically apathetic detrimentally invested false idea freedom sovereignty. Anyways, ya’ll know Texas comes Tejas, means “Friend”, Abbott friend. Republicans 50+ year war public education good reason.  ignorant society easily controlled. it. short breath six weeks after. seem completely recovered. Billionaires got $565 billion richer coronavirus. words Kendrick Lamar: “uh uh, fuck dat.” political theater Cuomo. Travelers Florida fly Newark catch train NY. drive. Uber. cab. think bus too. difficult circumvent. aren’t functioning normally huge percentage us effectively circulation isn’t 250k cases per day. sad say Florida hero friend thank service. Fucking troglodytes thinking constitutional right wear mask... One thing flavor: pretty involved local government Austin part South Austin Democrats group. We've received non-trivial amount feedback recently former (and current) members plan voting Democrat (Biden specifically) Nov election result last 4 months. feeling personal example makes little less confident position seem be. Two things. 1) hk gov authoritarian power
2) response hk driven people government. government always lagging behind. DeSantis waste space time now. Bring someone save lives better. Mayors join force bring idiot countries made work. ridiculous argument. "" Around 60 percent new restaurants fail within first year. nearly 80 percent shutter fifth putting life savings industry odds, financially savvy expect lose ass pandemic not, regardless, stupid restaurant worth people dying.

What happen new places open always done. would think entire industry would completely stop due economic setback setback over? Home values around still rising also. think decline going start reality many layoffs permanent starts set lot private schools near (k-12) planning person seeing parents go private full person option. suppose advertising smaller class sizes compared public safely, don’t know, sounds crazy me. can’t imagine spending money likely result still virtual.

[The Streets - Edge NWSL playing tournament speak. People wear mask vs people public. wear mask okay, dont wear mask catch much easier. 

Unless I'm misunderstanding whats big hype? non wear mask people gamble health non wear mask people. 
Shouldn't mask wear people generally okay? 

Also use Walmart example - cough stuff store spreading duh. goverment really cared would close big box stores let small mom pop buisness open limited capacity stricter cleaning rules.   Like seriously walmart like 500 plus time. spraying disinfectant stuff, register. 
The local bagel breakfast shop near let's 6 time cleans everything constantly Makes sense I'm angry well, needed literally 10 minutes damn good news I'm happy watched it.. chronic pain since started I'm still trying get figured out. Stayed home weeks (still except parks grocery store) watching country basically fall apart take action staying home wearing mask go out. 10 minutes something good really helped me. Ok online learning K-12 basically nonsense. seems want reopen everything else except schools. time giving solutions parents need work put food table. going take care children going pay it? 
Anyone thinks teenagers going socially distance schools closed fool. Even complete lockdown, teenagers roaming groups. also get drugs crime. 
And seems put eggs vaccine basket. safe effective vaccine even next year? People get actual infection getting reinfected months. seems one like cold coronavirus. anyone made vaccine cold yet?... Stroke great example here, Covid cause stroke (as per recent UK paper neurological effects). That’s serious schadenfreude Ok Dr. Doom. 

**/s** Yep. closures starting ramp up. initial industry prediction back March 75% independent restaurants would close permanently. Kids get sick too? would've thought. whole time there's confusion think kids rarely die, can't get symptoms disease even though less often. Plus like article says, we're healthy is. Plus let's pack classes even tighter!! already is.

That’s say everything great. strive accurate tell people go beach praising Black lies matter protests. think it’s sad they’re likely getting sick prison guards. really could’ve bubble government wasn’t shit show. ""functioning"" Wtf wrong   ""You want adopt ~~religious system (doesnt matter)~~ temporary measure reduces odds ~~me going hell idea exists not~~ able go back normal near future. selfish you."" I've heard name he's like ubiquitous way fauci is. person showing gun threatening manner they're dangerous individual. get semantics ""maniac"", person allowed carry more. first study looking effects masks preventing medical workers getting sick. point masks prevent others getting sick. getting sick, still doesnt work argument wear masks.

The second study even states ""While influenza virus
could detected RT–PCR nine volunteers
without mask, influenza virus could detected
on Petri dish specimens participants wore
either type face mask"" Proving masks work lol.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* went looked history. posted least 5 articles China! Ha. see, people realize actually allergic coronavirus flying blind... toward high ground.  

I really really hope fatality rate 0.5% end. 

But I'm super worried August 21, 2021? People liberty wear masks

No. don't. Stop bullshit. Oof, clearly seen reports antibodies covid may last couple months. means US keeps endless cycle semi lockdowns virus continue ravage country endlessly effective vaccine produces memory cells long would take US bring case count controlled level shutdown happen? Im thinking going get bad Trump forced it. people scream “Don’t like it? Leave.” someone criticizes America Bro, could def annoying screecher always thinks right listen reason. made website sexually harrass ex bf. could easily nuts people absolutely ostracized society.  Nothing beliefs anything value deserve legitimization given platform support it.  beliefs actions exactly needs made clear allowed ever happen again. Fuck guys. get nothing using violence ! That's credible evidence, that's speculation. widely accepted originated Wuhan, knows, country going open bioweapons lab investigation anyways. seems stupid treat rural Montana NYC.
And know Trump ordered national lockdown media would cry he's taking control like dictator generation lower average IQ, boomers Gen Z? killed risk people!!!!  Go check deaths per million NY NJ compare rest country.  It’s disgraceful happened here.  

The cases decreasing blew population here.  

http://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/nyregion/nyc-coronavirus-antibodies.amp.html

26% positive antibodies NYC.  That’s 2 million infections NYC.  Lot good lockdown did. asthma... fine masks... Yeah I’m really sure it’s allowed anymore anyway tbh.

Like entire thing politicized. 

We pretend hasn’t we’d ignoring reality.  thought idiots protesting wearing masks? contact unemployment offices ask new EDD debit card (they lost mine mail) 

I think contact Bank America, EDD that. order new card 1.5 years ago, that's contacted. hope helps. exponentially growing. Perfect Covid info page loops back click “more taken enhanced health safety measures. Follow posted instructions visiting Walt Disney World Resort. inherent risk exposure COVID-19 exists public place people present. View important details.

When click View important details loops back place take decisions, negligent causing deaths good reason go jail least charged. economy.

It's election. Period.   issue grain truth, good conspiracy.

There deaths clearly COVID, deaths clearly COVID (maybe cop choke death something?)... gray area.

Let's say cancer... fucking get COVID. Great. Except survive COVID, exhausted. zero COVID system. week later die.

Are COVID death? sense, no. mean COVID gone killed cancer. way look would ""would lived gotten COVID?"". creates blurry area. reasonable case say death happens caught COVID could blamed it, stating cancer cause death seems decidedly false too.

This excess deaths far important hospitals call stuff. pneumonias certainly COVID, people called COVID deaths maximum week left underlying condition. completely impossible clear coherent line going gray area cases.

It's fine admit that. However, excess deaths good metric, natural mortality ignored estimate earlier years maintaining proper social distancing?  fire? said international air travel stop inter-EU travel halted. depends bad alternative  ""We"" warned ""them"" multiple open shut orders would worse one major shutdown. Evidence shows children rarely spread virus children adults. Try again. level stupidity would unimaginable point (and still world). r/unexpectedtoddakin absolutely believe that's true. ""12. start cleaning bathrooms."" Put Ayn Rand. Atlas isn’t going shrug. There’s comparative advantage local taxes can’t overcome  read article? Several indoor spaces A/C backdoor reasoning reduce number tests turn around faster? Otherwise I'm baffled he's thinking based history. Believe algorithm area would say quarantine test results, return work negative, develop symptoms. positive, get tested quarantine. hate DeSantis. really hope gets indicted point. He’s fucking criminal struggle *lot* understand people masked, especially common ones made thick fabric. already auditory processing issues voices sound like mush helping.

So ask talk slower louder I'm gonna risk lives trying hear, lol.  Thanks advice. leadership change, four years millions dead. Damn right, shouldn't. Teachers' lives worth economic impact parents. say parent, conscious privilege, yes. Lol athletes health conditions, that's rich Yeah. kids one year apart. never sick life going pre-K 2nd grade... sort cold bug every damn week seemed. Interesting. 

However, effect nuanced looks slightly different usual seasonal drop.

In Australia's case, we're entering peak flu season getting mid-summer numbers. effect much less nuanced. co-sign this? Ah, dude. someone sneezes you, that's far less 10 minutes. 

This pseudoscientific horsecrap. complete BS wish would stop articles complete nonsense. wonder mods Disney sub removing posts commenting virus again. removing ""ruining Disney magic"". live Houston, I've gotten back touch old high school friends nurses within hospital system here. 

I've gotten collective answer; really, really......really bad. They're already transfer patients parts state hospitals filling quick. 

Not mention testing kind crapshoot here, many people STILL refuse wear masks, hot (102⁰ 3PM today) everyone rushes A/C A/C, oh EVERYTHING STILL FUCKING OPEN!!! Well think it’s sufficient say saw massive protests locations X Z Q. Locations X saw huge upswings weeks locations Z Q saw things declining still ergo protests clearly driving main factor Ed Yong: ""A country that, 7 months pandemic, still ensure healthcare workers enough gowns gloves protective equipment going able distribute vaccine efficient way. simply isn't""

Thoughts? also get tested.  learned that~~ Trump care ~~about white southern Republican voters.~~

He'd probably sell child slavery feed complusions broken brain (apparently) cannot feel empathy. hyperbole.

And makes challenging effective Coronavirus response president's brain (apparently) broken. UK alum here. What's Lol, makes think would wear helmets masks? would call fake news. placed source deniers FB comment “its flu”. Approximately 34200 died US 2018-19 flu season (usually October-May). lost 132,000+ countless died home undiagnosed since late February. paperwork &amp; organizational disaster tried early flights China? Info incomplete, different formats, software fucking ancient software, stuff still faxed. People got calls asking quarantining last trip years prior. feds-- likely think states existing system place?

I think simple ""have airlines send over"". kind software project (tying airline records state records contact info) take years complete. know mean way, that's lot like saying ""we need violent crackdown protests black people accepted 2nd-class citizens"".

But yeah, opportunity Trump handle well. completely blew it. that's he's Trump, that's supporters love him. non-american, beggars belief see time, Fauci stating pretty much obvious repercussions effects virus government always reacting like he's alarmist doomsday-lover.

That man right throughout, guess still enough wake moronic excuse government up. Good old Chinese shade. Love it. That's horror story wrote there. Actually, bit optimistic that. Remember initial outbreak Wuhan? people China live highrises. still managed contain that. feared/speculated sewer system may spread Covid. least, recirculated air air conditioning definitely spread virus. Still, stop Wuhan crushing curve. High population density highrise living definitely mean virus spreads uncontrolled. course, huge difference China dealt Coronavirus, governors certain states dealing same. guy sucks agree. taken two tests NYC CityMD. times told 3-5 business days. times 4 days. free tests, maybe reason lag vs something I’d pay would get quicker results hate say it, kinda agree. Everyone can’t work home, work educate young child. half going daycares, what’s point. Take precautions, substitutes lined up, keep kids isolated class. Sure area outbreak, maybe school go virtual needed. Remember happened people *thought* toilet paper shortage?


What think would happened Fauci said wear homemade face masks, *do not* buy surgical masks n95 masks shortage? Holy fuck can’t stop laughing. I’ve given lifetime opportunity I’m gonna waste degree leads personal trainer getting PT school. Live life guess many better degrees pursue. One hope.... wish pessimistic much lately left room optimism good news one guts address issue... think start calling ""stupid zombies"" joined sometime January great back mostly US wasnt hit yet much discuss random stories happen somewhere US US politics, barely see posts countries anymore news virus also gone down. Depressing see international sub turn chatroom Americans. Land fees. Home broke. I'd say that's *slightly* harsh considering enormous pressure lot Asian students especially go mimic, pretty dot overall.

There's reason programming classes can't online, though. Luckily county commissioners commissioners county next mine made decision make masks mandatory public places.

What need see next distance learning least first half school year get cleared up. last place need spreading coronavirus school system get teachers, parents grandparents.

Being government employees Florida right work state laws place make illegal teachers strike. second-degree misdemeanor also lose license teach, job get unemployment top fired. happens rarely. every feel good story like millions cases fired ruined. Bullshit. course did. social distancing sporadic mask protection. idiots Michigan protested quarantine. C19 discriminate based political affiliation ethnicity. Serial killer 🩸🩸 Stay heck home (I realize that's possible everyone). 

You weather storm. storm right now. Here's say world going able control new cases extremely low levels, tolerate flaring again. East Asian countries like South Korea Japan eradicated virus, what? Tens, hundreds cases day. far situation China. feel China alone situation. Looking forward long period world divided two halves. recall use divide countries first world second world on. Well divide world similarly according COVID-19. globalise world challenge mankind maintain communication two worlds. Today EU said resume flights within member states, extended invite China, long also open door them. Right hesitating, despite excellent relationship terms diplomatic economic relationship still recovering wounds Beijing's Xinfadi Market outbreak timid state.

And finishing remark US ""we learn them"" US 70,000 cases day still maintain normal operations? That's something learn them. learn world, world learn us. learning ultimately overcome virus. world must unified response order solve problem. learn us managed eradicate virus; learn nation 70,000 cases day, NYC total 300,000 cases yet still retain enough resilience could maintain basic level economic activity. Learning nations individual essential. Decoupling sealing solution. bunch friends dont wear seatbelts. One person know bad accident wearing one saved life hell never wear one. dont know others thinking said sounds right. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know couple dont like airbags either. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people wear masks. Already MN... Feeling need fly NORTH pandemic stop even measures? end 2024? 

Would still comfortable paying entire 4 years degree even got one semester in-person classes? confirmed negative day before, day departure, stop non essentials, wear masks limited stops, practice hand hygiene ge ok. Without knowing anyone recently exposed hard really give reliable info. Hope able hook big ones. Idk man...the world views persisted long time. comes back making working classes hate one another. article indicate many cases Florida Europe. ‘young adults’ Europe social distancing? 


“Florida Governor Ron DeSantis attributed spike cases increased testing outbreaks among young adults social distancing.” possible middle kind Darwinian event? maybe imbeciles eradicated gene pool?  Maybe?  Please.... maybe. never said people deserved die responding post above. live ""rich"" area. one hardest hit places Michigan. Many days, numbers bad worse Detroit. Worked actual Nazis, maybe impact new batch fascists. 🤷‍♂️ confirmation merchants stationary device phone aunt virus mid March took antibody test early June. neg. took one last week pos. Americans learn phenomenon? 🤔 

Americans superior. Bad stuff happens countries. Therefore ""other"" people need go home country bad stuff doesnt rub rest us.

Well, that, washing hands wearing mask. 

Take pick. Wow. live NorCal still haven’t made decision. this, pulling son enrolling homeschool program. Well it’s technically true don’t specify year. Saw coming mile away Meh freedoms desires oppose everything govt says. Turks &amp; Caicos lol die DeSatan think communities get American tourists right know. Small towns hamlets tucked away could exposed many us bigger cities.  Ben zona, know history well. guess never heard Zionist movement Jewish homeland Palestine. Palestinians early Jewish immigrants called Palestinians? say Palestine old passports? would call indigenous population region called Palestine prior Jewish immigration land? Palestinians. ;) 7 day average highest month conclusion NBER came fair, issues done. think outlets taking conclusion NBER's working paper arrived running technically correct misleading stories. Ah, yes, homicidal indecision governor. think people going want rent owe thousands dollars current land lord happened me! flu, like mentioned, rapidly deteriorated. first onset symptoms right-sided heart failure 17 days. 24 years old, healthy otherwise aside fainting disorder, great physical shape. took months able walk one block hill one flight stairs.

Edit add: little guy. love Probably it’s rooted Presidential recommendation. worse... may sound crazy, firmly believe they're trying get states herd immunity, insane strategy (crazy numbers people die way unattainable goal). That's thing think explain ""strategy"". sounds awfully similar racists saying Islamic culture mix American culture. I'm sure would one first criticize line thinking however. He’s done harm mask issue anyone else state. City officials wanted enforce masks coming lockdown May. Abbott torpedoed rules weeks later San Antonio figured mask “riddle” called allowed businesses require them. month dipshittery didn’t need. it’s local officials party won’t enforce mask mandate last ditch effort came far late. 

Now least two weeks row he’s threatened lockdown late week things don’t improve. Monday comes back says lockdown coming. Making sure never happens again? That's cute.

There plagues hundreds years. pandemic barely decade one. ready time, ready time. horrible, reality humans change drastically without centuries time Maybe cross river Mexico? See they’ll let u guys lol Generally either. asymptomatic people. preexisting conditions exceptions made. Hospitals enough capacity. going live alone isolated forever there's vaccine. going take calculated risks like society since forever. Driving cars perfect example. Anytime someone gets car risk death injury. Yet get every single day. Welcome hypochondriac world, know odds contracting dying kinds stupid illnesses. It’s good place. Turn around go back came from. Spanish Flu coming belt. isnt trumps fault isnt helping modelling good behavior Yes, was. ""Everything essential businesses carry-out restaurants!"" shutdown countries did.

The problem reopening backwaters flyovers (cough... Florida) opened quickly opened things like clubs dine-in restaurants stayed shut vaccine nearly cases CoVid-19. need keep mind comes out,it average person get it. government prints money bro. socialism rich. tf downvoted? Trump idiot people argue police qualified (partial) immunity, like remind politicians judges full immunity. politicians ones kill many one decision.  Hope haircut worth hell going community college pay 5k?

For time I've attending community college, never pay $10 class. whole year, (spring, summer, fall) cost $63, that's 2.53 gpa 4+ years attendance. time ever pay full tuition academic probation, grades picked went right back waivering tuition.

Maybe different places I'm shocked anyone would pay 5k 1 semester community college. plan even pay much one semester eventual master's. However I'm also California resident going school locally offers incentives stay attend college another state/country. someone charge could make happen *they couldn't* definitely see you’re saying. thinking along lines school summer hence time plan actually execute family vacation. bet March hellish spring break schools give huge winter break there’s still time months like said us Michiganders can’t take heat y’all supply come July🥵 least one dead teacher St. Louis, too, early schools closed. think that's idea that's standard way, buddy safe going bar? worse. ""It’s always comedies get right. much much better spot. NY done much can’t bad right now, sheer volume americans needing aid there's many even one Governor’s announcements last week mentioned running low testing supplies would pool tests... isn’t stupid, he’s mentality denial. irony think act weakness facing music. Another 6 weeks, probably 8 weeks, incoming SAF/SAH. We'll practically back April next week.  already lot worse Wuhan. already 282K confirmed cases Florida, compared 86K confirmed cases across China.

Inb4 ""but China lied!"" - DeSantis deliberately hiding numbers Florida freedumb American news see posted, post left many open questions. HQC standard care NY. discontinued citing benefit increased risk. reasons FDA discontinued. still arguing this? kooks come from? Facebook/YouTube quacks really held responsible false claims practicing med without license. pretty convincing. actually slightly less people Australia (they’re 20-30million). mean say 7x less cases? almost jobs, manufactures services suspended stopped, stock market goes high rocket. Generally speaking, stock market something reflect current economic activities, blooming economy real life decay, that's excatly really concerned about. Really? them? Fear natural response kept humans alive thousands years.  Lack fear 135k dead quickly getting 100k new infections daily.  deaths infections 100% preventable idiots like keep standing way. forget Trumpy Bears! 

(Yes there's teddy bear looks like Trump. like 40 bones) Look well China! Nearly cases there! fact impossible number people ran around without masks.  Testing tracing isolation government measures.  easy task fuck America, he’s sure trying! Wow mean protest anywhere else? must sooo smart. protest NYC might zero cases now. think 700-800 cases daily STILL good must joke.  thought herd immunity need least 60%. That’s 180 million people US need carry antibodies time. Exactly! pretends everything okay mind reality it’s not. Agreed. He’s psychopath doesn’t respect intelligence anyone think he’s billion times smarter everyone else. such, doesn’t see anyone else people level him. never got 20k cases, problem. top reopened without ability catch trace new cases. look EU, need copy ironic travel Europe quite frequently like bread more. Probably often fresh (I eat hotels). US disguise lot things. swear looks like healthy bread, usually look back every package see much bullshit put there, never thought look bread.  oh shit, true. except... already control Taiwan? invade Vietnam, they're already Communist economy mainly rice ~~cheap~~ affordably priced shirts?

South Korea strong economy would make tempting target. Also relatively close by. they'd would hellish invade, battle-hardened staring NoKo decades. mention peeps run zillions anti-Zerg missions StarCraft ;-)

The Philippines might bit easier. weaker economy &amp; hence less tempting target. Plus they're furthest away targets, lotta ocean clear China's shore theirs. 

At rate might well go Japan -- closer Phils, stronger economy, plus pretty much demilitarized WW II left Uncle Sam see defense got notice classes online fall break October. two weeks prepare all-online curriculum. *""Everyone's health care decisions own""*

\- woman who's never made health care decision spent trillions it, shit.  police called, kick guy threatened staff gun. harm foul, right?

The trick white. Disney capping capacity. Still dumb idea go, it’s nearly easy gain entry normal circumstances.  Jeezus America, why!?! know! given virus airborne droplets, seems reasonable assume could settle food get inside way. I'd love someone tell I'm wrong back science, would love one less thing worry about. AZ screwed. claim ""smear attack"", exactly looks like he's doing. Among college athletes possible. Way wider range health ,(especially divisions). see pros issues amount medical attention already receive. fact is, he's straight playing politics. Republicans foolishly (yet again) allowed Trump get wrong side issue, admit total collective failure double down. knew they'd double down, right?

Stay safe, friend. we’re getting reduction utility costs. We’re spending MORE, less; al costs tons costs associated setting people work teach online, etc. buildings things going besides classes. one example, research going many campus buildings, vital research cannot stopped — cell lines, animal breeding, etc. buildings kept don’t spend even get back line everyone back. isn’t like turning lights shutting door extra bedroom you’re using. don’t buy it, everyome fucking death count.  donkeys top make bread somehow. brought money him, metal briefcase all. That's nuts  talking about?

Did forget Trump pondered can't inject household snowflake. triggered truth fit narrative.

Fuck son - that's quality lied. people died. get woke.

Fauci never lied people dying Trump's lack leadership Trump's lies. Lolololol thems mettul wires! Never trust em. Hope latter happens already happened me. think sadly mistaken. matter millions kids get grandma dies. Trump voters still blame 1) Democrats, 2) ""it's flu"", 3) 5G towers. making classic mistake Democratic politicians make: voters rational. .. swiped right... NASCAR literally willing kill people make money. happened three weeks ago get manhattan Ithaca. Felt like eyes entire trip. know is, thank God Sweden study now. think great job overall, pointing Canada great masks. said, definitely going enforce mandatory masks quicker places US will. That’s exactly science works. assume whatever makes sense true, need question think matters more. economies stronger they've followed virus prevention measures they've responded accordingly shitty trade deals sanctions. They've got upper hand global market America remains shut largest GDP states need constantly cycle opened/closed bullshit piss poor federal guidance. Mondays usually wee day Sunday, number cases lower.
This serious shit. they're discovering Myspace illegally downloading new joint Lil' Jon Kazaa? hipsters happy find new band Canada called Arcade Fire. Basically saying "" rules apply gun "" 

Murica' Why? First release country people cured vaccine safe use  We’re well here. case count high today, 543 whole country. Yesterday 243. I'll pay it, culture habit pissing head telling raining. supposed free environment? generation told chase dreams raised, supposed pursue dreams bankrupted useless education system, can't afford healthcare develop skills make career shift? people wonder anxiety high society? whole insurance BS serves reduce turnover companies enrich healthcare industry time. serve average people. limits options, makes career shift harder. *reducing* freedom move new career. 


It's simple ""healthcare working"". want pursue dreams without fear trip hospital going kill us literally financially. COVID right now, unemployment rising, dystopian joke trapped jobs, health crisis, need healthcare, need risk lives go work, leadership want fix problem. Let's forget that, since people rely companies insurance, they're still getting laid off? crime humanity? like, everywhere turn, much joy room maneuver removed world, supposed it? sound like freedom you? won’t. 

America made clear care. 

We stop pretending “staying open worse economy” it’s quite clear true. 

Americans pack businesses every single person country infected. 

If people want government lockdown again, think need start honest. then, you’ll never convince others trustworthy, they’ll never listen recommendations. It’s largely irresponsible publish articles like this.  comments showing people say “I guess it’s cool gather large groups disregard social distancing “. It’s hard believe blame entire surge Memorial Day weekend say nothing came protests. seen ot mutated infrctious strain.. several articles already posted here.

So gives? mask distancing help people give credit sheer dumb fucking luck?  Disney best plan US deal Covid. Literally spent millions dollars months planning opening. Now, don’t agree open given circumstances, Disney running Florida, would next community spread.

At point, would rather Mickey Mouse running Us pandemic. fine stock market record highs. MeRiCa great again. USA care plebs. Third World countries cares citizens part world. wear mask work going grocery shopping. know horror movies monster sneaks someone doomed victim empties mag vain getting eaten? That’s technically guns blazing, too.  tourist spot avoided. Given Kansas City's proximity extension states, positively rule possibility individual may visiting different state.

Again, agreeing methods trying say fact meant. merely offering another interpretation. people enjoy different things become CPA? Proving fiction. Jack Ryan competency real. Donald Trump competency is. never reach herd immunity reasonable amount time. 10m people Sweden, 320+m America. paper 1% right now, reality maybe 8-10%. research antibody resilience shaky point. virus could mutate like 1918 flu. viable option herd immunity fucked. Hospitalizations real big number watch. lot people dying home, continue hospitals get full, even tell whole picture.  Almost everyone knew thought summer heat would kill reason. That’s nobody (regular people, live southern AZ) cared opened early, heat gonna kill off. Boy wrong. It’s already happening extent — CA rolled back lot activities Texas closed bars. Texas Gov Abbott threatening lockdown last resort. 

I think people don’t care shit gets real area panic. problem waiting hospitals overflowing shutdown they’ll probably end lockdown second free bed. $50k year fucking high school? Holy hell.  thing happened Albuquerque. believe majority US responsible 

  Berlin, steady decline 400 confirmed case 3.7mil population, even people hanging bars outdoors open windows, though think time bomb waiting happen.

I currently going paranoid meeting friends beers outdoors, caught forgetting keep distance. really hammer repeat mistake, know chance super slim, yet really try keep mind it.

To read shit like I'm going nuts slim chance really drives nuts. fuck still question? love fucking God, even allowed happen? I'm even religious, pray US American friends desperation.  *warmer* Unlikely. 

Anyway, even official Chinese news sources report Hong Kong separately giving numbers. I'll believe see it. 2016 election, seeing normal, everyday Americans handling pandemic, way hell would bet even $5 Biden going win. I’m tired guys hard believe official numbers, tho. hand millions sick China would probably come whistleblowers. Unless fake tests population Would using masks helped Fauci told us ineffective.

Wow - almost learn things brand new told us effective everybody listened first time.

No I'm sorry wrong. $129 day-look rich school district! subs make $80 day. Calls like sees People initially told need shut allow hospital’s get ready surge. Instead opening economy locked even tighter. shamed people going beach kind gathering people listened continued hide house. BLM protests started sudden everybody shut COVID made lot people look around confused. BLM protests calmed media experts went back COVID going infect everybody simplest interactions. 

People go back house like initial shutdown officials accept this. No, never got one Kansas. kept eye news find orders, alert would helpful. Huge surprise. /s 

LV casinos want discourage anyone coming throwing money them. goes making non-smoking. Think might reason anti makers? People trust government/media good reason seems. Youre piece shit. goodbye. simply say, “Put fucking mask LOSER.”

They don’t like that, fuck would used worse language. put politely could. Population 1.35m spread area 1.5x size California. 

Makes easy social distancing. Also hurt tourist destination Canadians smart listen scientists recently watched presidential candidate debate Kennedy Nixon. nearly teared thinking seriously talking improving education think going now. Keep scrolling 11 am- long list updates day, covers lot topics. diagram clearly shows deaths going steadily three months. sure, probably manipulating numbers. /s

I guess SCB must manipulating all-cause mortality then. need California.

As go lockdown again, going pointless continue allow infected people Florida, Texas, Arizona Nevada come undo work.

I would absolutely snitch Arizonan coming infecting people think keeping locked without safeguards cruel unusual punishment. everyone follow suit, TBH. 2400 benefit American Holocaust 2020 brought GOP stock price rose today due two analyst reports. Things looking Mouse! OMG please making us lose faith sanity smarts Florida voters! Poignant response. sure crushed one. Sounds like completed phase two ramping production. So, place moderns Oxford vaccines. missing something? Middle manager industry accounting here! live economically depressed state low cost living low median salary. None accountants CPAs. 

You getting ROYALLY screwed.  “Modified operate outside”

I think they’re already good operating outside. Nobody wants move South Dakota lmao third world country lot rich people. sources, related coronavirus, fuck talking about, we’re talking coronavirus, it’s management Lol sides absolutely refuse give us universal healthcare. JB said M4A ever made desk, would veto it. told guy ALS face hes universal healthcare. establishment made one guy trying give us universal healthcare- pariah spread tons lies, mischaraterization, omission facts. said trying take away peoples choice work-provided healthcare, even union leaders (not regular members) saying trying take away healthcare fought get. Also narrative purported Burn Knee basically saying people dumb make decision. late, debate pushed m4a deemed trying use Covid push political agenda benefit. said “HOW GOING PAY IT” spend trillions prop stock market instead helping needy, even using money giving loans business donors. Us citizens might take things hands force *blue* establishment force Jb drop actually save humanity doomed 😞 Maybe figured like US large number cases problem... I'm sure win they're offering fully online option well. nature

Hmm start rap group got Minnesota. give shitty looks, refuse talk them, walk well way around them.

If intentionally crowd me, softly cough mask. usually sends scurrying. brave. 🙄 Pretty much since shit. Glad got 4 year degree master’s degree Locked shitty government job. Yeah, considering educate everyone unlike foreign nations schools, well.

That little 'secret secret secret' foreign nations like admit: child learning disabilities even intelligent? bother try educate them.

The United States? least try even comes great expense. yep even everyone family doesn’t wear mask quarantine, literally one person know actually following rules universities infrastructure pay go away they're temporarily online. universities also projecting massive losses year. That's they're lowering tuition. worth, professors learn teach online first time, much work they've always done like semester. unfortunate part despite possibly everything well possible (countries recently Ebola epidemics practice), poorest countries world going get absolutely hammered this. commentary angered anti-mask advocates, accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask.

Hold on... *anti-mask advocates*?? America go home, drunk, probably superspreading covid  Says you. hk people wanted ml border closed immediately. gov agenda COULD ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY GOSH DANG SET KILLING US 1% CHANCE STAYING POWER LONGER.

&amp;#x200B;

No really, I'm NJ shut 3 months country would trajectory line EU nations. rest states followed like would FINE right now, worry fucker Arizona come vacation drive us lockdown again. Blind Optimism never government policy.

That's funny. policies last 4 years? Exactly. going shitshow we're going throwing together exactly way threw together Spring. Except time admin going like, ""Why shit work, summer plan?"" sad mistake? killed tens thousands people. governors make Cuomo’s decision. It’s travesty proves Cuomo isn’t fit office. want 50 cents everyone sub community college 1k-ish/semester, public university 3.7k semester well. unusual see prices like that. Chinese people incredibly humble. horrendous US's responses are, still give US credit things they've done well. Can't imagine US leaders China. plan. open--close--open--close--open beginning. state large implement useful track trace. hopefully plan cause many unneeded deaths. excited see market goes month, end year. Today’s sell “legitimate” market I’ve seen while. good reason Tesla trade 1700 w/o ever making profit. NQ hitting ATH’s. It’s healthy doubt it’ll end well. 19 months swine flu pandemic. 

7 months COVID19 

Also: swine flu apparently 18k confirmed deaths. locked states non essential travel hotspots. still locked, rightly so. state leaders see fit. 

You're federalism bit different certainly help control virus currently available academic research suggest almost stopped stopped community transmission them,

What factors control making statement. words percentage decline function closed boarders percentage decline function factors controlled for. There’s contact tracing. Protest minimal cases. Big spreading events bars, restaurants private / family gatherings / parties. Shouldn’t headline /s end?  This. Let's say somehow manage EVERYBODY earth self isolate month. virus pretty much die off. get people could possibly think vaccine way. impossible enforce thing, mitigated solution caution basically gone. NZ showed works.  Fair enough. Even that's case, though, reason listen expertise put forward. seems contrarian. forgot inequality weakens us all. Shave belly rusty razor  Could individuals sue DeSantis negligence? positions government funding butchered year year Trump apparently environment fucking matter. Government positions become competitive, friends lets say morale poor. Sure! Look Florida's [daily state linelist](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_linelist_latest.pdf) lists every individual (minus personally identifiable information) tested positive state Florida. PDF almost 5.000 pages first 70 pages people died.  economy else think grew beard cut short? It’s classic fat dude “jaw line” Also safety, extra surcharge $99 Umm...You know overall death rate Florida running 5000+ deaths average year deaths attributed COVID-19? Could somebody cooking books? number kids traumatized result pandemic seem big concern. know is. It’s pretty awesome here...except -35C winters amazing amount mosquitoes summer already behind long pandemic started. time suddenly care that. fact basically experts really horrifying specifics beyond troubling. 

Not implying laypeople know shit ins outs disease, effects timeline bits.  must need reading glasses. read gums blazing. devout republican. tired scientists phds telling believe in. alternative facts, besides death rate less 1% know one guy Facebook lives Texas wife's best friend's neighbor nurse told friend guy's facebook wife hours cut one coming hospital. refrigeration trucks standing AC hospital malfunctioning. So, know better... /s case.  Fuck Rogan meathead douchebag wanna-be Rogans think questioning everything makes intellectual interesting. shit fucking rocket science. honestly believes COVID kill incapacitate enough Democrats hand state trump November. 

It reason makes sense. 

COVID=Voter supression 2020 sad tried follow guidelines many refused take seriously there. doubt poor leadership Trump GOP. Border controls necessary Europe blow up. Testing tracing isolation enough. wasn't. Australia Canada inter provincial travel allowed. truly sympathize parents situation. sending kids back school endanger them, families, teachers, aids, school workers, bus drivers community large - extra precautions funding, regular testing, guarantee pay sick days teachers, real plan - insanity. months get situation control come plan done neither. responsibility educators find way make work. true, individually applied states selective incorporation. Same. cautiously happy closed dedicated covid ICU went back regular ICU handful covids cycling out. think would last long numbers kept going down.

But last couple weeks started reconverting rooms back covid ready. Im ready watch 3-5 people die every single shift. think we're worse today march/April. gotten ppe in, even enough reuse. Rubio doesn’t much going least said wear mask.   That's going nearly impossible pinpoint, given many ways contract it. would likely multiple employees cases deaths proof negligence Thanks well wishes! Europe, I've seen Paris, France, Ireland, Munich London. wonderful there's much left Europe explore! Americans much vacation seeing rest Europe take long time. worth going 2 weeks flights/jetlag take 2-4 days time, 3+ weeks worth it. shorter list Greece, also want see Spain, Slovakia, rest England, Germany, Belgium Slavic Baltic countries.

Hopefully international co-operation vaccine available soon put covid stuff behind us. hang catch then. wonder ""certificate COVID vaccination"" become extra travel requirement (after Visas) countries future? Fucking duh. economy fucked shortterm shut down, fucked longterm sizable chunk population *dead*. Unfortunately women’s sports don’t count lot people. 

I however looking forward watching Thorns get smacked NC knockouts Friday. Europe still welcoming refugees heard... When? America founded LOL. idea the”American Dream” could anything wanted Americans still hold today. I’m it. Florida: ""hold beer!"" Try go Germany, worth every 2,000 pennies less Hoping sooner rather later. Teachers go back 2-3 weeks ""Total shutdown?"" What, like before? LOL take opportunity remind register vote yet. live see November ACTUALLY GO VOTE. Biden get president polls say so, make happen. I’m curious people seem believe protest heavily masked. left early many individuals weren’t wearing them.  Covid-19 16-Bit Virus, yes. let's imagine vaccine impossible virus ends like flu coming back every year (which I've seen mentioned possibility). would happen then? Would stay like forever would people say ""fuck it"", live let natural selection run course? Death inevitable, really good position. mention free loot taking. get pay wall rated US' ability contain pandemic pretty highly hit you.

I didn't, think worth recognizing covid like pandemic. moves slowly frustratingly difficult deal with, yet also contagious lethal enough serious problem left unchecked. 

The US also massive territory without strong leadership, states fend themselves. completely uncommon. Shooting necessarily mean people get hit/killed, car shot at. Maybe broken window. report cops go ""well get plate? No? Nothing it."" sure there's actually nothing could traffic cameras around actual investigative stuff like that. Sometimes even *with* plate nothing seems happen can't prove person actually shot you. dashcam might better case they'll look footage. Based court rulings constitution can't discriminate based state origin. treat everyone same. get face shields amazon, dont know hospital would let use get Actually lot states second list vastly improved. Louisiana still fucked almost little reassuring see worst states improved. Chill dude. Nobody moving anywhere. blowing steam nobody takes seriously. like saying moving Canada election. Nobody that. Lmao virus woke. I’ve heard doesn’t spread protests woke causes, yeah virus definitely unlike other! Yes, many states take seriously take appropriate action timely manner. federal response late continues reluctance unanimously see truth impossible discredit it.. late. 

Density matter sure, really comes social responsibility treasured value along individual rights. Sue ground.. earth vegan. mean, ain't wrong. morbidly obese women better hope catch it, die. talking here? Question: can’t they? I’m genuinely curious. Australia several states closed borders it’s done really well eliminating community transmission states. keep wondering virus going tear whiney snowflake anti-maskers leave us safe mask wearing social distancing stay homing good people power. Paywall, could tldr? Vancouver thought? Idk stopped paying attention  Fuck pay wall many protests observed mask use? 0 people, see. ""I tell bitten not! That's right American! can't stop going Zombie infested grocery store! AMERICA!"" certainly boring year far I’m sure voted missing something? US able get cases considerably social distancing policies first 2 months without violating people’s basic rights complete shut down. problem didn’t stick long enough convince people basic things like wear masks. family too! 4 kids insurance September 1st due job loss starting new job Still waiting miracle disappear overnight it’s 1 single particle get sick.  It’s total viral load get.  10 minutes build concentration need Yeah, I'm feeling one. lax precautions, fine - drag court that.. civil rights/racism? Uh, no.  need sports. Keep out. need anyone coming non essential reasons. full price? 

No offense online classes close worth state tuition schools. college experience big reason people willing pay that. think we’ll see big rise CCs universities really think industry won’t cut prices corona No, bullshit. honestly believe children cannot spread one particular virus happily spread every virus existence, incredibly naive.

If want live happy bubble pretend going away day now, go ahead. I'll protect family.  Flairs friend.

You filter flairs entering ""-flair:USA"" search bar. filter flairs entering ""flair:Europe"".

Alternatively, head /r/Europe filter submissions flair Covid-19. That's fair point, although Marc Benioff actually saying mirrors epidemiologists saying. He's extremely successful CEO/Founder who's bringing word business/finance audience. people say across audiences, better. case, wear masks make money, works.

Marc Benioff also pretty good guy. I've met several times he's heavily sponsored lot charity events donated heavily combat Lyme disease.

More point though, reason post exists he's co-sponsoring $1 million dollar prize designer mask adoptable public.

I'm saying he's Gates Foundation, he's delivering COVID-19 vaccines next weekend, one initiative lot may make difference, that's here.

France: 17.4%

Italy: 14%.

These countries reporting new cases pretty strict lockdowns, numbers fairly accurate. virus exploded, healthcare systems overwhelmed. demand medical attention could met short amount time, mortality went significantly.

With 3.3 million cases rising, healthcare system becomes overwhelmed, risk experiencing mortality rate akin Spain Italy.  sex worker, Antonieta, showed Reuters late last week how, addition donning thong, sequined eye-mask sheer, crotch-height dress work, could layer top paper face mask, plastic visor, gloves gave demonstration sprays bleach solution pole uses dance clients brothel operates several biosecurity suit allow us work protect ourselves,” said.

LOL really dumb ? love state entire fucking country shut right now, Texas especially. dumpster fire. took screenshot posterity. 

So look back decade now, wonder city fought Harvey managed fuck so, badly. Well fucking shit. daily “new record!” covid headlines getting repetitive wire helps mask adhere nose. conspiracy theories already developed claiming 5G antenna for...reasons. AP put fact check days ago Gotta learn smize. Finally seasons America's Next Model paying off! United States worse Wuhan ever was. Miami new Miami. starting career one economic disaster starting family another one. way worse 9/11. get it. fuck. portion US population either care actively anarchist spreading COVID?

CAN SOMEBODY FUCKING HELP US PLEASE? COUNTRY EMBARRASS FUCK WH POINT FORCED CORRECT GODDAMN CALL DIRECTLY LIKE BLUNT ASSHOLE PLEASE FUCK know owners quite well, used live block away (bison empenadas dream)

Knowing owner, guy probably could mildly complained allowed carry order. I'm sure Bob throwing fits mask mandates. bbq thrives evening dine live music That, Trump Shut-Up! You’re proving point. care lot. Several friends close losing business. lose businesses can’t get things control. means case numbers come down. needs enough testing employees screened. need chance small business loans seem gone churches Trump cronies. selfish pricks refusing wear masks need get head ass right thing fix this. I’m angry. shutdowns solution, problem let virus get control. Yeah, people trying sell idea one particular virus somehow incapable spread infected children. makes sense believable.

Someone started cherry-picking data present theory, course Facebook anti-mask ""it's hoax"" idiots jumping it, pretending science. really want schools open keep home year. might easier said done perspective but... go back. whatever fuck do. People awful parents afford return kids, either. 

I'm professor, love nothing teaching, FFS please know y'all heroes pandemic. become martyr batshit politics. Please. AZ? No? actually didn’t need them. fact don’t need bad, going send hospital staff. would replace with. older brother, he’s done using big wheel? guy finally says something makes sense? Wow! Listing symptoms like trying list Superman's powers I’ve seen, Tampa’s great wearing masks. time I’m publix get groceries though. us - - rated US' ability contain pandemic pretty highly hit you. Lol. Onion worthy news title. American people dying painful death. unnecessarily harsh response. exactly questions. lot bad science going past several months can't trust whatever written articles pre-print studies. dive deeper far tell link actual study.

Case point, headline opening paragraphi wrong. says ""half covid-19 patients"", mean ""half hospitalized patients"". shows loose journalists terminology difference drastic. Half hospitalized patients could mean half 20%. 10% patients vs 50% patients huge difference explicit. usual response. meaningless ""you need screaming congressman"" ""can't work dead""

What done instead offering solution, turned around make asshole. Like, piece shit going work also putting kid school. schools daycare thing. people nothing say turn around like I'm problem would say probably hover 90s%, maybe even 70s% would argue opposite. Giving kid much/too easy life much sure way ruin giving life challenges. 

I actually worry lot that. kids much easier life worry grow frat boy douches outworked throughout life. Germany maybe I've seen couple posts last days, they're long way down.

The KFC house party got cumulative $26,000 fines across 18 people also got posted sub. (family 6) August. I’m petrified. Evil company hiring persons color. dare they. Thank much link appreciate it! could better job? Well then, whole lives. Tell us more, professor. cases went forestry conservation approach quickly realized labor market wanted slim reliant politics. Conservation jobs park management super bare bones compared timber surveying work wrong guys office funding bled dry. really sucks. hate line talk certain religious people use. article ends “When weighing responsibility faith leader, Mr. Satterwhite said, returned beliefs. “My personal belief is, faith God,” said. “If God wants get Covid, I’ll get Covid. God doesn’t want get Covid, won’t.”” 

Well shoot. that’s you’re excuse behavior others object to, come doesn’t apply everything else? Say... abortion extreme example? more, hypocrisy shows. Chicagoan here. Covid compliance #1 criterion establishments I’ll frequent. Thankfully rate still low. hired support public education, hired dismantle it. Stop shocked give shit. Fuck Betsy. CCPG waiver it’s called think. Every year apply that, plus FASFA, many scholarships can, semester time limit run pay$500 semester.

I wrote financial aid offices SAP appeal said coronavirus made impossible finish trigonometry statistics.

I’m probably outlier exception unfortunately usual results aspiring college graduates.

They say equal opportunity basic principle god never fair. mayor Los Angeles waiting OC Karens? US freaking screwed. kids serious danger along teachers. It’s like sick SoCal experiment. thanks , kid apart this. Serious question, would take request recall election him? can’t wait two years turd. See hell Abbott. flu season killed estimated (not lab confirmed) 62,000 people US alone. 18,000 lab confirmed deaths swine flu pandemic across world, although number known badly underestimated due limited testing. 

Still, I’ve said find hard believe high end 575,000 deaths pandemic could accurate considering level chaos current pandemic caused healthcare systems, burial services, etc. observed 2009. Sure one hit quicker unevenly countries done great job suppressing transmission, also lockdowns prevent virus becoming overwhelming certain areas. passed outdoor restaurant day red-light looked saw lady's kid running back forth tables mask breathing around everyone's food. Noone seemed care. know even possible really create safe restaurant environment. Probably, they'll drop symptomatic start charging excessive fee. system completely swamped right now. Bc people dumb don’t mind heat.
The heat reason won’t make hour trip there. FTA: board's recommendations binding Vancouver way get changed. take refugee status immediately. Amazing possible?  guess.  likely? No.  still spend lot time indoors tho.  thing spread quickly.  

I’m saying danger, I’m also surprised wasn’t huge exponential growth it. agree. support Donald needs delete Twitter focus COVID  Reduce salaries offices top-heavy senior admin positions - chancellors, vice chancellors, provosts, deans, etc. Academic administration chronically bloated years many institutions. madness lies there.

And say gun owner. What’re saying exactly? sure understand point. mexico try do?

Even include death causes, CDC chart first source provided, death toll still heavily decline.  get downvoted feel same. Losing job something can't afford happen child way. Good, pansy states someone else 1st. Except, children really abandoned hope. Gavin right. asked county officials make call, right thing do. I’m tired winning. I’m tired GOP. I’m tired “MY FREEDOM!

Shit happens sign rights away worded poorly. meant public schools need attendance receive money. private wholly funded parents, flexible, though adamant attendance, right reasons. 

I went public school, know it’s like. want present, don’t give shit try. Individual teachers do, I’ve great ones, I’ve also shitty ones. private school, it’s teachers care. administration cares.

Wuhan, Chinese govt fought tooth nail stop spread! beginning evident pandemic flooded tests, contact traced art put sick critically fever houses spread families, importantly locked down!! ! Florida NONE besides testing. March! feel optimistic take good look governor you. Nothing! Florida may virus, virus done Florida! DeSantis class own

Don’t say that. governor Georgia wants sit him. 20 years 21st century...  true! Ontario really looking forward road trip maritimes summer :(  US able get people voluntarily 90% compliant social distancing without use force violation basic rights. impressive I’m guessing China could learn this. 

Our problem didn’t stick long enough really hit home importance achieving. reopening process that’s problem getting people understand ongoing threat. getting people wear masks. People thought done could go back “normal” people charge sending message economy’s sake evidence pointed necessary continuation social distancing measures least degree. DeSantis needs resign, Trump needs removed office. need people listen science, doctors, professionals know better!  Seems like economic cost would going control versus allow virus run course.

The initial shock losing 5% population massive mostly old unproductive economic citizens.

So end, cut economic costs old? make plague world end overtaking non-plague world?

That’s happened americas. Europe entire history one plague another came America, diseases carried killed local population.

Damn, RPG choices getting tougher. YOURE BOT ADVERTISES SUBREDDIT.  agree ""it call make"" wrong. he'd made call, think would've good choice. also see million reasons 18yo would pass chain instead-- boss call 911, makes even harder kid it. wasnt really open threat. point moron trying make gun plus face mask illegal. wrong, however showing gun threat. lifted shirt showed it, didnt pull it. said anything along lines ""id like see make me"" showing it, yes threat. wiener feeling threatened make threat. make clear verbal statement physical action. places may try charge brandishing, however depend lot individual states laws regarding open carry concealed carry.

Prime example TN this. carry permit, state allows either concealed open carry. feel go physical, lift shirt place behind pistol. statement willing shoot you? Sure is, doesnt really matter. would legally argue merely switching open carry, legal do. threat makes clear legally would result clean shoot, even play switching carry method card, shooting someone illegal itself. illegal shoot someone one could carry need exists. context situation.

That said, MAGA man learn exact laws regarding can't do. Maybe knows them, them. line want walk carelessly, eventually catch charges. Almost dumb told us masks increase chance infection.

Damage course, usurp yet seen. Europe continent long history countries able agree things long enough flex collective might. Culturally EU member countries diverse it’s hard see changing future. UK already out, Germany always fill reluctant central bank leadership role, southern countries always drain resources produce much economic value comparison. Western Europe also virtually ability project power becoming important militarization CCP. see inability Russia able bully rest continent around even though nowhere near model productivity.

Ultimately it’s choice US China superpower back given differing ideologies, world interconnected truly pick sides anymore however. may current anti-Americanism due Trump nationalism, think overtakes European authority’s dislike China stretch. No. virus brutal consequences everyone, even younger population likely survive.

It always way. information since March, people chose care United States, research Centres Disease Control Prevention found 705 first 2,500 coronavirus patients country aged 20 44.

Of 705 cases, 15% needed hospital treatment 4% ended needing intensive care.

...

Even children end severe cases virus, revealed study carried Chinese doctors published Pediatrics journal.

Their study 2,000 young children COVID-19 found 11% cases infants classed severe critical.

This lower rate severe illness adults, shows children still made seriously ill disease."" Several papers released claiming children vectors. I'm pretty sceptical findings. age draw line true? Indiana county 27 cases confirmed (so far). wear mask go social distance possible. Buuut 331 million people living country, 3 million confirmed cases. math right (i suck math, please, correct I'm mistaken) confirmed case rate vs total population little 1% mean barely 1%

Granted, % deaths cases HELLUVA lot higher confirmed cases vs total population count something? broad governmental powers could brought bear. still be. Right playing game ""whack-a-mole"" i'ts working. Lol it’s funny every citizen every country willing talk critical country guys suck government much.

Than breath get mad every country’s citizens post one pro thing country. It’s funny hypocritical hey keep bootlicking means won’t killed lol live Manitoba. Lots people still wear masks public. university resuming classes online fall despite low case count. We’ve done lost things right here, also got really lucky. 

(Also Premier fucking idiot) bad feeling record get shattered every week Fuck off. dude's stance pretty much sums world view. Anti-masking epitome selfish libertarianism. wear one feel they're apex food chain virus ravages poor, feeble, aged, minorities. fact, many anti-maskers believe social darwinism taken rightful conclusion.  Ditto. Got first one one 😲   People like love joke putting protestors “in line” act surprised outraged protestors come armed self-defense. too. he’s President country.... Yeah. phenomenon old humanity. reason can't nice things. woke.

Can complete caricature fucking goof. two beautiful! Stay safe. Czech :)) Clue; Mrs. White! health insurance 10 years, can't even remember last time checkup. feel like literally can't afford it. morbid sense, certainly helped stay healthy, can't afford be. I'm living life like 1820 barber may well doctor. Meanwhile Florida. Downvote want wont anything. live ca gonna stop people going shopping. beginning thought bullshit saying children weren’t effected. Bullshit. ever walked kindergarten? It’s one big cough. one communicable disease children high risk for? None! released studies knew fuck even talking about. It’s even respiratory disease. It’s type inflammatory disease. unknown repurcussions. virus outsmarted every turn children guinea pigs. Really. NC Shutdown regarding businesses &amp; mandatory mask order? know you, spend 7 hours per day, 5 days per week Walmart. Neither kids (they stay home one parent shopping).  thing stop death. knew... Fuck that. need Cuomo President United States. 2 weeks whole “not reporting certain days” stupid opinion. I'm Boomer. really affected much. Sure are, true every age group.

Having isolate certainly something I'd choose, forever. People wondering able eat pay rent, staying home seem like horrible sacrifice. feel workers especially healthcare workers facing danger going jobs. Staying home certainly weight nothing.

I know Boomer whining tough it. conversations boomers bad children grandchildren future holds them. Frankly Boomers badly things considered. recognizing territory controlled country playing ""political"" card? Tards: We're really well. 

Covid: 👍 Plenty flight crews staying night too. Oh JFC. I'm saying he's wrong Monday morning QB'ing entire ordeal fucking ridiculous. 

More people also died medical community told us wear masks beginning since done complete 180 stance. Trump wrong medical community...all done fucking terrible job this.  much could 1 avocado toast coast Michael? $1200? talking doctor last virtual visit. said there’s mutation one spike proteins Covid-19 made even communicable, they’re looking labeling wave airborne. believe news sources beginning report hasn’t “top” story far I’ve seen...yet.

I talked couple friends mine — one published works virus, r&amp;d pharmaceutical company. said (and sorry I’m hopefully isn’t botched sounding anyone) changes two fold:

1. receptors 

2. flexible spike doesn’t break easily. 

They far determined mortality impact far know. Also doesn’t appear like it’s effecting current vaccine research 5-6 months line knows. Disney suck big D! Bunch idiots. That’s happening Florida, Arizona, Texas California right except inside hot. Doesn’t bode well snowy states winter. whether Taiwan country. fucking spread political views every time get chance. Man idea. That's horrible :( welcome midwest. Please go swing state make difference. fucking stupid Americans?

All products vandalized public education system apparently trying finish off. REAL shutdown, even close happend China even Italy Spain! Ironically enough, ones risk severe complications virus ones likely vote *and* masking up. define “normal functioning society” Holy cow love Canadian right now. city 25,000 hasn’t seen case 2 months. Canadian support keeping border closed Thai's internet news channels aflame. people utterly pissed treated like 2nd class peasant country moron regime allowed privileged people (Egyptian soldiers family Sudanese diplomat) entered Thailand without mandatory 14 days state quarantine imposed returned Thai citizen. America sends people, sending best. Wynning! Dunno you, I'm Vlad made vaccine record time. deaths rising probable cases even know hospitals many areas swamped COVID cases, they’re lab confirmed, there’s real surge deaths aren’t coming, even though already are.

Yeah, makes lot sense. individual state level may add Ya mean like majority last general election? 

We're democracy, we're democratic republic best honestly late, oligarch. true mean ""even""? literally title article. ‘Asked model ""reasonable"" worst-case scenario, suggest range 24,500 251,000 virus-related deaths hospitals alone, peaking January February.‘

So maybe summer help stop virus all... can't hear you. Take mental illness reddit survive I’m leaving Texas never coming back. Fuck states government doctor gives mom wrong medication dies, blame doctor ceo parent company owns, among many things, hospital doctor works at? Besides, wasn’t point. It’s worshipping doctor utterly failed flip-flopped simultaneously incessantly bitching another guy arguably better job despite experience. know sure, I'd hoping automatically flu test covid test confirm symptomatic actually had. Watch they'll call racist  don’t think that’s true Austin. Epically stupid! course not.  majority people wearing masks. 

Does one use critical thinking anymore.  course count every single person. Jesus Christ guys children? fault, rarity. enough good science educators go around. Math science teachers highly demand, there's glut literature/humanities teachers. high school, science teachers particularly specialized educated science. school rule athletic coaches come teaching staff (so budget would go teachers, coaches) school ended hiring coaches assigning classes teach. went history science, since classes filled. ""taught"" biology creationist/swim coach. I've done best educate I'll always wonder could I'd better education. whiz chemistry, geometry algebra, poor STEM subjects dare pursue past high school. Wow Biological mechanism explains child immunity happen, doofus. Well yeah, end ACA, think benefit struggling millionaires/billionaires! ""Fuck me? What's wrong even anything?"" ""EXACTLY!"" Lol God damn. r/jesuschristreddit free willfully ignorant, turn takes freedoms away... missing freedom works? reality government balls admit virus officially control. hope contain virus anymore USA. chance late February / early March. would required coordinated effort across entire country. United States proven divisive coordinate unified effort required control virus find countries like Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, etc.

Once accept fact, must must reexamine goals closing things like schools, businesses, like. must also acknowledge fact virus tends fatal people low number healthy years remaining life. overwhelmingly impacts elderly existing medical issues.

At point tradeoff protecting risk freezing lives / development / livelihoods everybody longer makes sense. longer relevant point success Germany, Italy, Taiwan containing virus. US never able implement strategies successfully.

The fact people major risk death virus putting lives hold are. 10 year old miss entire year school protect 90 year old dying Coronavirus? even protecting 90 year old going? virus widespread seems inevitable. Herd immunity likely way out.

These questions easy answers. suffering either way. Trying ignore cost people's lives either side equation wrong. Including kids, teenagers, young adults losing important years life, virus statistically impact lifespan. Also rotisserie chicken Costco, yep, added sugar.

the fuck? Coronavirus positivity rate hovering around 15% OC. move best part country. Lived Canada entire life, snows twice winter (and years all) melts immediately. Way back 90s, even avocados! hard tack water, TAP!!!! Lol wishful thinking, try harder They’re mostly insane *redacted* boomers. board President keeps husband come expert he’s doctor. comes dressed scrubs, never wears masks said masks may cause developmental disabilities kids also might operating rightwing troll account twitter called “leftedexposed” dumbass prager u video talking terrible idea shutdown economy. can’t make shit up: chronic hives due anxiety really help hypochindria now. Karenavirus Mutations go direction. TIL they’re called Utahns  whole country shutdown 3 weeks let county decide. dance state decides folks crossing state line bringing virus. never ending game.
Having moron president fucked up. want Gavin force shutdown would make moron president go even 180 degree opposite. Huh? No, Orange County going get screwed. people state California four largest areas (Bay Area, San Diego, Los Angeles, Sacramento) taking seriously masking up. incoming wave retirements teaching staff refusing come back work environment, school system going stressed limit. smart ones actually live Orange County (provided live there) going home schooling online courses instead. Lived Germany 6 years. confirm. almost like society never meant two full-time working parents... capitalism anyway. worst Johnny Depp movie. Yes someone sneezes you...of course.  It’s called viral load.  Sneezing someone significantly worse walking outdoors masks on. related coronavirus. spam here.  far know, phase 3 lasts 1 year Yeah fat chic dead gets Covid, probably stay home without mask fine. Stabilize upward direction. terrible patient...a terrible president. would surprised. There's lot people fat muscle even though *look* overweight they're actually super fucking fit. Hospitals run short ICU beds &amp; ventilators.. 2014 hate hyperpoliticized country (and website) become comment downvoted buried Controversial.

Your comment without question true - fully agree support message behind BLM protests, people ignore impact coronavirus suddenly spiraled control within couple weeks disingenuous best.

I hate Trump want office, protests literally anything even slightly red media website would screaming bloody murder repeated country-wide mass gatherings royally fucked us.

The blindspotting people sides political war incredibly dangerous. 1. Wearing mask slows spread infection, something agree good. 

2. Certain groups like minorities people less income affected public health issues face negative outcomes (more poor people per capita die covid, cases means survivors may long term affects well)

3. governor colorado refused order mask mandate recently [last despite evidence would save lives poor people minorities lives period. acknowledged people wearing masks time GOP silent Baby Boomers doomed us all. He's gotdamn correct saying too. absolutely excuse USA's citizens' collective behavior current pandemic. Ignoring enabling virus selfish, reprehensible, unpatriotic, that's say Suddenly seem worth without sex parties. Shame. really sucks enforcement orders falls employees often paid worked. Law Enforcement really even legal order states. Sheriff's still openly refuse enforce mask wearing Michigan dumb get away enforcing helping.  women eh I'd wager proximity hotspots. Pushing better world isn’t politics. Seems fucked job. 

Admittedly, live Bay Area cost living high, entry level service jobs industry (wine) pay around $19/hour don’t require college degree. 

I can’t imagine surviving $19 hour, let alone $13. Politics always part science, bet many people who's research position agree He's terrible president remembered such. Fauci served 6 different administrations honors entire bloodline get 1000 years. Go back twitter paraphrased last name DeSantis looks like spawn Kenneth Copeland.  Social gatherings culprit 

We BLM protests Australia too, recent explosion new cases (we around 250/day one state gone full lockdown). government specifically announced indeed social gatherings causing spread (as per comprehensive contact tracing), specifically protests.

It 'large family gatherings' mostly contributing spread here. I'm French Gen Xer born 1980. end lockdown late May, wife decided split, together 16 years, kids.

Since I'm child parents (living 800km away) getting old, moving closer soon going necessary, help need it.

So nearly 40 years old, move back quiting job nurse previously lived. First time living parents since 2003. plan getting another nursing job ASAP get there, thankfully profession jobs available, even pay pretty bad. month line move appartment close them, still visit twice week more. get means 2/3 people get asymptomatic, right?

How many people family? two? Always wanted ask conspiracy nut this. believe sources internet others. see one links Bulgarian dude, believe others? life mundane order spice life live world believing one source, believing contrary source? asking. EU based huge redistribution resources warping market subsidies. That's exactly free capitalist.

Also approach freedom dubious best, dictatorship ""greater good"" freedom.

As fighting tooth nail retain rights bear arms actual ammo shoot with. point steps away enshrining 2nd amendment constitution. time. held line longer first place stayed top contact tracing mandatory mask wearing. everywhere else world managed figure out. give political pressure. Run response medical perspective minimize economic impact we're going again. wanted forced something thought threat (to political indentity), threatened cashier force. Maybe start lockdowns flu couple grocery stores Hernando (DeSoto County) Saturday. Maybe 25% people wearing masks. workers weren’t wearing masks. hasn’t taken seriously all. Chinese 50 cent army web censors. Anything remotely critical Chinese communist party gets downvoted reddit.   take dirty bomb nuclear cleanup....it's good :$  Dont hold back man... get can! Children low risk death know, though children young 6 weeks died, would worry catching it. might long term complications too, far people months lingering issues, know yet. can, yall younger probably fine either way, definitely make plan happens one gets infected laid out, someone take care baby. catch plan probably put baby monitor upstairs quarantine something. I’m PC family go out, usually ones wearing masks. America full idiots?!?

It's OC. They're fucking idiots. Norwegian friend I've jealous following life social media. like lives different planet me.  without gun, even. don’t think herd immunity possible. Remember large percentage people don’t symptoms all. Nothing.

They live like wear parish.

The entire genetic pool change, probably like 2 generations. might much choice, Texas teachers aren’t allowed strike risk losing pensions certifications do. It’s absolutely fucked up. :(  crazy part one basic aspects Keynesian economics US almost never it.

You spend cut taxes recession keep economy moving even deficit goes up. cut spending raise taxes economy recovers make gap, make rainy day fund lessen next drop.

As country addicted spending never willing set cut temporary programs. Cool, good luck “putting line” reference.. 2017-2018 flu season, 959,000 people hospitalized 19 nowhere near many hospitalized COVID-19. Follow reading: words... prepare winter. lol reason ithought wrote ""masochist"" instead machinist. need go sleep Seems like guy lose license, least. opinion Ioannidis remains Can't understand anyone would think that. Oh wait. America... 

Seriously, plenty places hot climates continue outbreaks. Absolutely nothing pointed summer slowdown, US, anywhere else. Except know pretty well viruses live wild. virus like came meat market infected bat somewhere South-East Asia.

Just China deliberately mean holding country wealth China responsible crappy food safety measures resulted viral outbreak likely kill millions.

I'm hands-on learner. 

For college, went expensive $45k-year private liberal arts college. still college, say confidently there's way hell I'd spend much education quality could get University Phoenix fraction cost. mention...college best four years life. I'd willing sacrifice even year distance learning, would rather taken break school things back normal. found unconstitutional. surprised tiny weenie protesters all. Insisting following mask mandate showing gun. wanted pressure business pouting employee duress.

What purpose could man intended showing gun threat? Aw dang, must switched numbers head. bad. Get man bootstraps got bad lymph gland infection rashes week ago. likely got MIS, too. 39, way. Seriously, way Americans act, would really trust Americans snatch masks? would happened nurses doctors initial surge states? Look happened toilet paper hand sanitizer. still short. mention, put place thrown orange shit gibbon. think Fauci pretty justified. So, yeah. GTFO. It’s like could fucking tell people do. convince people necessary things deal pandemic. You’re pushing right wing talking point undermine trust man served country since Reagan. think would done better orange-skinned dufus breathing neck?  harping Fauci fucking President*? Huh? Holy shit. hell still alive right now?? going set us back many months trying get pandemic. never learned listen science facts? Mind-boggled 9 non-household members huge risk hotzone like Texas. like flipping coin betting least one asymptomatic carrier. Given escalating positivity rate really want socialize one person outside immediate household time being.  Whyyyyyyy would yo push fuckin hard open right gonna massively fuck next season? 

There personal income tax Florida, make money sales tax. everything closes down, Florida money. easier shut state gets tax revenue even people stay home.

It's fucked up, think that's reason. would good time federal government step in. That's what's curious, see coming. Maybe civil unrest want current environment. crazier shit leading November, ammo attempting cancel postpone (or whatever) election. I’m panhandle live TN. Lots non believers &amp; non maskers traveling home town family is, PCB. haven’t seen mother, grandmother etc. since January. Neither spouse family course 1 year old hasn’t seen family this. It’s heartbreaking see everyone around go vacation knowing could infect anyone family members especially 93 year old grandmother. everything safe keep others safe, sacrificing time important people life don’t much longer earth. one around us cares though. It’s moms birthday month I’d give anything go back home, thanks fools, don’t think that’ll happen. Hong Kong independent territory then?

That would breaking news. mean new New York? 

Wuhan grouped city. Lets forget China one responsible trying hide thing. think misread. Florida vs. Arizona, Australia. Imagine people getting coronavirus watch rush hour traffic Take politics away public forum. bad governor douche bag. Can't agree nothing. everything could make worse. someone routinely loses money /r/WSB incredibly accurate  Everyone avoid enclosed areas strangers. matter wearing masks. &amp;#x200B;

**Los Angeles San Diego Schools Go Online-Only Fall**

California’s two largest districts made joint call amid White House push get children back Area faring much better (so far) statewide rule make sense.

OC School Board Votes Re-Start Classes Los Angeles San Diego school districts announced campuses reopen next month, Orange County's Board Education ***recommending students return classrooms without masks social distancing requirements.*** Oregon also wear face mask outside can’t maintain 6ft.  basically time people still jackasses intentionally try get near “lol” come many states able enforce quarantine, even least tell people wear goddamned mask? wants open schools even know we're gonna peak. man absolutely people economy. Virus can't get blood mosquitoes get first. Smart thinking Manitoba! People diabetes already compromised vascular systems, irritation blood vessels would certainly promote clotting issues and/or blood pressure issues We'll either find cure (so long term cases managed, think antibiotics plague) it'll go away (we make vaccine, combination mass lockdowns immunity tamps down), seriously deadly disease gone indefinitely else human race would died it. might years forever, use time improve way. Yes, tolerate morons. take political shit stay everyone's face. Careful, promoting factual narrative may get called racist and/or names end -ist -istic. I’m saying herd immunity achieve distinct advantages Europe 1600s. case achieved losing significant portion population several generations. mass death occurred centuries new populations became exposed experienced much greater population loss. happening everywhere time. Even one place gains herd immunity sooner, many places probably much behind. assuming herd immunity even possible.

Also, virus talking about? Smallpox? viruses course human history died due herd immunity able spread (or killing everybody exposed whole tribe dying). Smallpox first able eradicate human manipulation couple decades ago. case likely live constantly mutating form virus similar flu never achieving herd immunity.  Florida man gonna Florida man Fuck guy. made lose job still eligible unemployment reason. I’ve suffered months without work teased it. Bars shut Disney open. Wtf? I’ve never felt singled life. says 1 20 peopel w covid 19 dies. accurate? San Diego here, I'm ready. self isolation since March. 

Let's done it. Ideology hell drug. happened April. Damn. considered angle..... going want look state's self quarantine process. NY get one state they'll let take paid sick leave. business owners. This. parents kids ten &amp; younger supposed do?

IMO online classes right thing do, need providing SOMETHING families situation. 

We also need consider abusive home environments. need check ins, etc. Haha would make money YouTube gov't pays him. know Dr. Bilbo Lee caught virus here? recently died it.  money important lives we're losing this. pandamic really brings light selfish actually cares well-being others. think corporations/the govt taken granted ability endlessly fleece swindle public cant comprehend existence line sand. ridiculous contemplate somebody pausing cheeseburger wondering, “what push cows far rise up?”.

I’m one crazies. Fully board masks, lockdown, it. Thought opening way horrific idea. also come lot we’ve saying “look two weeks” multiple weeks now. Cases going awhile haven’t accompanied type death count you’d expect based first peak. I’m sure it’s fewer nursing homes, better treatment, weaker virus younger infection group something else don’t know. I’m genius. Maybe time true regular 60-70k days new cases deaths start following soon. hope not. I’m still concerned lasting effects death contract virus bet government started use money set aside people collecting social security people would care schools funding getting cut kids. ruling class could give damn future, yolo ammirite? find weird lung cells cats lung cells similar enough affected virus way blend scissors? live someone trust blend top/sides scissors, (get hair cutting scissors, Fiskars) get pretty decent look. means professional, watched maybe 5-6 videos YouTube felt comfortable cutting boyfriend's hair first time. Lack consequences empathy. literally change behavior personally feel negative consequence. also stupid. Yeah. gotta rational everything going keep making beneficial decisions. can't let numbers Florida large influence 800 miles north. High school teacher chiming here. us zero notice (not even grab crap Friday case). us classrooms set online. Several us infrastructure home accommodate. ironed issues, districts told kids none counted. 

I believe firmly things ironed weeks advance, whole thing would go smoother. did. tried keep fuckers traveled here. ignored us, DeSantis criticized checks highways. guess choose ignore that. 

Oh, Cuomo fucking buffoon. New York STILL leads death count wide margin, despite lower population. “leadership” want? so, MOVE THERE. Irritating, it? must needs done. described US.

Florida consistently fucks everything us lmao idk fucking spaz think reasons behind protest incentive one allowed other.

BLM reopening protests still protests hundreds thousands people social distancing. unbelievable think could spit mouth allow protest another protest due societal political affiliation. 

Use brain instead feelings. Separate issues ass, dimwit. Trump cut blank check nothing. White House. Every single Republican enemy America. Good move. well. Pew 2017 report US vs world. Child Left Behind caused lot problems. would anyone empathy something feelings? Especially evolve feelings people say ""hands let 'em starve"". Sweden dipping toe ""immunity passports"" (Germany first introduced idea back April btw). repeatedly stated briefings since certain knowledge long antibodies last, nothing made larger policy. However, even pessimistic results currently show antibodies last least 2 months. end summer, tested positive antibodies still follow recommendations hygiene measures, yes, visit grandma. rich folks here, matter public schools function, kids go schools.

Your example making sense. came well neighborhood. Kids still went public schools. them, many them. 

My point boast amount money desirable live public schools shit. clearly demonstrated bad case sour grapes. 

I believe you. trustworthy. 

Btw- good schools one things keeps property values high. Right, Texas. taxed Applebee’s (or Amazons. Apples. Facebooks. huge corporations whose profits increased dramatically pandemic), really, anywhere near amount paying, could probably subsidize small business owners. 

People don’t die don’t go bankrupt. could take $434 billion dollars richer America’s billionaires grown pandemic provide subsidy small business owners. 

Don’t blame people don’t want literally risk death (including many cases employees small businesses, also customers) keep government tax ridiculously wealthy profiting lockdown. friend Arizona. said allowed groups 10 people. neighbor joint 4th July party could invite 20 people. said everyone either someones coworker significant exposed everyone anyway. New Jersey resident works ‘theoretically’ NYC (haven’t actually worked day office since March 13th) unequivocally say go work.

Tell boss guy Jersey said it. authority make call state brought numbers down. boss knucklehead. He’s reddit! u/jaredpolis Cuomo NY throw everyone bus. watch -- really gave damn, open schools *at all*. way late testing tracing -- already need 100K+ tracers even get good sense true numbers nationwide. mention little inconvenient fact New Yorkers Californians quietly leaving state ""greener pastures"" Rockies Pacific Northwest, thus contributing skyrocketing numbers states. 

Make mistake -- 1% care *at all*. long they're making money, could care less worker bees (or families) getting sick. success story. Singapore South Korea also done well. WTF, older me! 

This country *beyond* fucked. Universities need taken pegs. super-universities unneeded horseshit amenities, $600 textbooks, Starbucks (yes exist) larger student halls, exorbitant grossly bloated tenure professor/dean salaries. Even courses bad watered down.  500-level English course professor talking seemed person course fucking around laptop class taking advantage social media technology bullshit learn from. told seemed use ""antiquated outdated 'deposit theory' learning"". asked told that's lectures memorize things learn.

JULY 12, 20205:40 PM

SAN DIEGO — brought money silver metal briefcase placed picnic table Miramar Reservoir. came lid: $100,000 paper-strapped stacks $50 bills.
All greenbacks beside blue water — wonder Lenin Gutierrez’s eyes got big.

“I [have] never seen anything like except movies,” said.

Three weeks ago, 24-year-old college student working Starbucks Clairemont customer came without wearing face mask. pointed coronavirus rules, left, criticized Facebook refusing serve her.

That caught eye Matt Cowan, Irvine marketing brand strategist, thinks masks good idea internet bullying bad one. started “Tips Lenin Standing San Diego Karen,” using social media label overly entitled people boil public.

He hoping $1,000.

The campaign reached within hours, hit $5,000 kept growing. Something struck nerve, vibrating along political cultural fault lines rupture much American life days, even public health crisis.

Newspapers TV stations San Diego elsewhere spread word brought interest donors far Australia.

Most people gave small sums, $10 $20, lot — almost 8,000 — cash poured in, Cowan said realized virtual tip jar wasn’t making statement. changing life.

Gutierrez grew Chula Vista family without much money. said ate lot rice beans. Christmas, boxes tree prettily wrapped, mostly empty.

So GoFundMe drive hit $10,000, ecstatic. hit $50,000, stunned. One hundred thousand? doesn’t words.

“It’s money anyone family ever had,” said.

Now, seemed like dreams goals — attainable. plans move community college Cal State Fullerton study kinesiology, mechanics human movement. passion hip-hop-infused dancing, wants apply learns art form, share others athletic trainer.

“I feel like I’ve given incredible opportunity never saw coming,” said, “and don’t want waste it.”

This wasn’t first time customer came Starbucks without mask, Gutierrez said. wasn’t last time, either.

Even boyfriend dad want go barber, good luck getting appointment time works them, especially since back work now. think boyfriend dad's barber on. world thanks valiant efforts assisting research regarding whether reinfection possible.


Truly, sacrifice benefit noble cause. evidence real world applications, considering variables, cloth masks provide protection infection. N95 N100. piece cloth gets dirty quickly, causes people constantly touch faces scratch adjust it...... starting get now? Hence question scientific study evaluate infection rates groups. types cloth masks offer protection vital infection, something politicians push ignorant plebs show taking actions. masks worked, California would closing indoor activities again, guess cloth masks job lol. 
Not looking reaffirm beliefs, subreddit giant circle jerk mask cult. 

How come mask studies done show reduction infection rates seasonal influenza? Mr Flip Flop Fauci recommending masks March. CDC EU Health Ministries requiring masks seasonal influenza. 

This 'Advice use masks

than reduce it. masks used, measure combined 
general measures help prevent human-to-human transmission influenza, training 
on correct use masks consideration cultural personal values.


Lancet published garbage retracted got caught. People need start saying Christians wear masks asking folks without masks serve Satan.

From Genisis (""Am brother's keeper?"") new testament bible filled statements taking care fellow man (the good Samaritan). Start pointing true Christian would go without mask make choose masks pretend christianity. 5000th time. He'd start cops. I'm suggesting *accept* it. find funny many people *cared* shit now.

That’s said, I’m calling it, it’s utter callous bullshit gives impression care inform far benefits argument cherry picked guess NY definitely stop people coming high risk states know, stuff.

Stop people what? Nobody stopping anyone entering, enforcing quarantine, like Rhode Island back March. Rhode Island gets called proposed enforcement quarantine selectively toward New Yorkers, rightly - governor realized amended states next day, appropriate direction go first you’re right RI shouldn’t stopped...

I would hope point abundantly clear disagree way RI’s decision direct travelers arriving state self-quarantine 14 days enforce quarantine. think extra step NY taken adding specific criteria state determine travelers require quarantine positive refinement policy, blanket quarantine order obviously going cover bases. bunch selfish turds! Me! ME! MEEE! Cause rights matter! one else's.... sick selfish shit bags like this. Makes hard take 20% seriously experts article calling bs number. Rude unnecessary income tax??

Phases dumb looking goal permanently reopening, Phases implies. Get reopening people's heads, stop mentioning it. gonna happen till there's vaccine. 

Yea, sucks businesses open close time, dying dehabilitated life worse. guess? Trump fire him, he'll become free agent able say anything wants Trump much micromanager allow deliberately. whether Fauci quit, yes opinion. cannot imagine able much good now. yes absolutely selfish; since selfishness lack consideration others. wearing mask helps people helps you.

That’s good, right? I'm 25 it, basically pretty bad flu me, never felt like going die. read comments article. big mistake. dumb like days earlier june like ""we proceed based data feelings slowly reopen safe"" felt safe knowing short time end week PHASE 2 EVERYBODY ENDGAME KNOW F*CK PHASE 2.5 PHASE 3 MONDAY :^) owners millionaires use money first. still need money that, talk, heavy reform conditions. Trimp already tarnished damaged vision US, handling virus governors Karens screaming wearing masks basically lost *social* status ‘super power’.

From outside, you’re country idiots wielding alot guns brutal sounds.

Heart goes guys actually care stopping virus. ZERO leadership..... Raise hands guys reschedule Hawaii trip every month like did. Hoping month choose month finally get say Aloha! July numbers btw. We're half way though, there's probably lag, referred June's. least Bory learned lesson positive test important things global survey, cardiac abnormalities observed half COVID-19 patients **undergoing Additionally, survey subject substantial case selection bias. example, **we know prevalence abnormalities undergo scanning**. view complex logistics around scanning, echocardiography probably limited clear clinical indications increased disease severity.  pay taxes schools aren’t operating intended? scary thing someone living US problems egoism spilling rest world terms climate change. guys still deniers famine start.

With Corona problems outsider, let US citizens countries. climate change fought globally right US acting like cancer.  Bulk supplements Amazon much better order there. Unless boycotting Amazon. You’re making flawed assumption children currently infected rates groups.

Schools nationally shut virus control. Reopening dangerous experiment.

IFR cohort based cases cohort, share total deaths cohort represents. Except poor folks work put food table taking worst risks necessity. Since that’s mostly Blacks Latinx give shit either. Fine, let's thin herd weaklings can't stand mask. Hey USA, I'm curious, reports long term consequences, COVID-19 going affect health insurance premiums? Feel free die COVID then. reason think coronavirus similar rate antigen drift shift influenza. bring influenza proving something? states decided yet Florida becomes horrormovie setting? different people, take serious long term damage even symptoms mild, know anyone long term damage. 

For reference, 3 months ago, classic flu like symptoms muscle pain nausea 2 weeks total, symptoms ceased still breath quite quickly month two returned normal. 

I know 7 people contracted it, one pretty severe case (40°C fever, really get bed 2 weeks, he's sure might've also mild pneumonia), he's fine well, another person know tested positive literally coughing even day symptoms. Hey idea. Let's let people wear mask. instead get spray face disinfectant every time breathe out. That's 20 sprays minute, keep talking. would feel safe comfortable that. courts mandate people lose fight mask rules. know may come sarcasm people go extremes fight point belief. Also goes through, someone invent spray mechanism lol. 

Oh btw work hospital, want say thanks. Thanks maskless shoppers making sure patients take care watch slowly die wither away. Maybe focus little energy actually providing resources parents learn best care teach children, provide consistency home, anytime take vacation (or pandemic hits) mean there's full regression. might necessitate shorter work weeks parents. Access therapy. staffing schools smaller class sizes teachers could accommodate meetings parents. 

I know sounds like pipe dream, someone working ""emergency guidelines"" preschool right now, can't honestly say envision happening, I'm realistic. point pandemic exposed many weaknesses, one expect educators sole providers many different types knowledge children many different abilities, expect parents exhaust jobs point can't expected understand best raise children none us coming top here.

I honestly feel defeated. Sorry, conversation UK here. mind awfully, leaving grown ups talk moment? Imagine brain-dead still blindly trust ""anonymous intelligence sources"" Iraq, Syria, Libya, Russiagate 1.0... ""The fundamental rule freedom America can't use harm others""

It really isn't. freedom cost greater risk. think second amendment stand ground laws about? posts getting deleted anyway. I'm getting karma tanked bunch salty karens. Yes billionaires laughing. think see climate liability right now, want us dead. Frankly. facr brainwashed best world therefore want get creative look countries dealing issues.

USA!!!!!!!!! USA!!!!!!!!! USA!!!!!!!!! USA!!!!!!!!! USA!!!!!!!!! missing? Article says “almost half”, yet sites 1 8 people severe cases hospital? anyone idea, please post here. one. Probably besides starting petition, see helping any. .... spez? Lol Yes think people, even people agree masks understand Covid real threat.

There rational people sides. virus going away people put masks. mutate come back. going anywhere. 

The question becomes going spend rest life wearing mask social distancing? people masks see things taken far rights taken away, slowly losing liberties. 

You believe Covid serious believe government watched closely regarding force us do. slippery slope cattle carts.

Some us understand risks value freedom security. see anything wrong people philosophy. mindset benefit people long term mindset puts blind trust government what's best us. 

Once again, government give shit health. Look healthcare system see much government cares. 

Peace good health all!! Swine flu mild though, 2017 flu actually quite bad Covid even caught globally yet.  Sunday 12.000, right? Somebody dumped soda (ordered without ice) crushed bag lays head. sort non-lethal tar-and-feathering. would great video huffing cabin cheered “maskhole! Maskhole!” chant caught on. would try play victim insinuate passengers liberal actors funded clintons, wouldnt again. people would probably try recreate video time rest life. Maybe he’d become agoraphobic. Replace anti maskers “gun owners” comment still stands. difference America like, 230 years old. new shop, know better 😂 Whoever goes idiot. working taking everyone anti-maskers. 70 year old surgeons wear masks 4-5 hours time. 

FFS, people 40% lung capacity wear masks. UK two months lockdown, empty cities, stay home etc followed slow reopening still going four months lockdown. 3 weeks done it. person wearing mask??? One never know may also mean covid deaths unederestimated kind chaos see takes lot death lot shorter time whole swine flu. would pay exactly? take several thousand refugees countries it’s taxpayers do, lol. fucking hate it. It’s unfortunate catalyst xenophobia. Yes enforced earlier we’re pretty much end lockdown phases told wear little mask hardly “worse restriction” remember old days waited decade rewrite history, month. Fuck you, OC. Well racial achievement gap get even worse shut schools. Inner city teachers school systems way lot kids. saying antibodies may leave body pretty soon recovery, think there's much immunity virus. anyone else find odd American flags draped every single table ""totally July 4th"" gathering? 

This study pretty good job outlining impact death rate across age groups. found excess deaths people aged &lt;45. Moderate increase deaths across ages 45-74. Large increase deaths people aged 75+. Advice germany people infected COVID-19 wait 24h Symptoms ceased, longer contagious allowed leave self-isolation. know moderna. Source? Obama greatest Republican president still checks out. Definitely. one ig models went home person...  suppose cleanse genes? round decide wear masks? Sterilize them? Put train cars ship manual labor camps? mean confined spaces global pandemic? take care ones provide little economic value. mean, methods US countries done past ""genetic garbage"".

I'm absolutely wearing masks extremely important, man, fell eugenics super quickly there. Gross. I'm homebody, pandemic really changed much me. I've worked home since 2014 rarely go out. need find suitable home hobbies rotate through. Humans used great adapting, people need put little effort.

Since March I've gone cat's cancer treatments. lost fight last month though, month. Honestly cannot wait forced furlough next week. literally many things like home I'll fill week easily. feel bad people need ""be out"" occupy themselves. age jackass Now? sorry parents go Anyone catch it. Kids less. far 171 kids 0-24 years old died US Covid-19. 440 died pneumonia related to
Covid. one wants see child die, fact kids far likely die accident illness. Approximately 15,000 kids die accidents every year. covid mortality rate children would increase 85 times even get close numbers. Yea rape super funny /s Lol we're fucking doomed man, think every Disney villain combined could think scheme evil lot did, Paycheck Protection Program. flattening curve vertical line. doctor, shhh. definitely, definitely, *not* Zodiac killer.  Yep. States/Counties/Cities honestly keep mask mandates place *permanently* &amp; keep fine-tuning pandemic plans ready deploy drop hat, that's *only* way we're getting crushed bioterrorism now. :( live side world, that's way say Desantis given chance. ""You blood hands. pray never another restful night sleep life."" would like see source massive Trump coordinated response Fauci, Cuomo DiBlasio, think New Yorkers would listened. 3/15 became obvious getting really bad, New Yorkers started listening Fauci. think would listened earlier too. market yesterday people wear masks even though they're mandatory public indoor places. old couple people wearing them. Even cashiers wearing nose city hit Covid. 3 cases March-May June 12 cases far July 9. local night clubs started working that's really good. elections tomorrow hopefully restrictions lot people speculate even quarantine curfews kind doubt it. remember back March everybody scared. walking usually crowded places empty. number cases small conspiracy nuts spread fake news hoax numbers pumped scare people lol. june country started hitting 100+ cases everyday since days around 70-90.
My wish catch vaccine comes out. defeatist say stock market built rich poor. Anyone buy stocks, commission-free - apps/brokerages Robinhood make dead easy. brokerages support fractional shares, even buy expensive stocks/funds Amazon Berkshire Hathaway. poor pay 0 taxes capital gains well. Great question. good answer, know lot users wouldn't. 

Sub tends pretty choosy dislikes. offering stats downplay virus, bad. offering stats make look worse, good. 

Just hoping one them. Texas might perfect storm costs Trump election. suspect final death toll skew heavily toward older ""muh freedom"" anti-facemask voters. even conservatives turn sour Abbott, might bother going polls. Texas's electoral candidates would seal election Biden. store MI everyone got alert mandatory mask today. Made jump Nope. He'd NFL team kind money. NFL still let anywhere near trying kind money. Floor Duh.

Do like debt? no, since post-Pres. Clinton, bets regards maintaining balanced budget. Golf War + II, financial crisis corona. Krugman even received Nobel prize economics one main voices increased debt spending. Obama nearly doubled debt 8 years, Trump built personal empire debt. loves stuff. quantative easing QE, ZIRP zero % interest rate, financial cost debt minimum, entices everyone dog spend have. corner painted can't escape. destroys interest rate pivotal monetarist tool destroys interest rate market tool correctly price risk. We're building GDP growth wobbly foundation. Disney knows. probably financial trouble acquisition Fox. reeks desperation. I'm saying disagree. see news showing cops Preside, mean, people wearing masks.

It might actually taken seriously rest US months issues really bad. pity idiots spread vulnerable non-idiots, perhaps without even suffering serious illness themselves. know he's poor allowed even look buying NFL team, gives us upper limit $1 billion most, that's extremely generous. wouldn’t say that. reduced spread significantly allowing health care facilities catch necessary equipment discover techniques improve patient outcomes.  ah finally, beginning think i'm person internet given life reckon heating evaporates water droplets making harder virus survive longer.

That's like ridiculous notion since Jeff Bezos able become self-made billionaire anyone can! worked little harder stopped eating avocado toast they'd like Jeff Bezos! Wear face shields. Easier breathe. really sad, sure ask many covid deaths we'd without lockdowns

It hypothetical pretty soon. precious little literature effects Spanish flu. tells us generally non-event contemporaries.

I suspect that, massive social unrest, massive unemployment sudden disappearance large swaths retail, one remembered quite while. Although much hope wrong. cynic might conclude charge much get away with. went house party tied one 3 cases Corona, once. 40 lot. party Michigan. guy looks miserable. Nice sources. No, old image.

You also forgetting Assholes Orange County directly south Los Angeles County, *those* tests Los Angeles County could actually Orange County residents. would surprised fucksticks charge county keeping numbers artificially low, reduced testing area, making desperate people Orange County go towards neighboring counties get tests. \*did  don’t see civility. cautious prediction.

Disney World why? 
Gyms why?
No mask why? Well wants live. 1) Incompetent people charge

2) Giving conflicting advice idiots meant united states, seperate states state.

got it. Obviously education suffer. US' education system rocky already. Fair play. mean, he’s exactly wrong. Within 21st Century _so far_. climate keeps heating up, disease gets worse. US unemployment system designed support pandemic shutdown. bailout “small businesses” managed bit better. Guess keep doors open! source called asymptomatic spread? disagrees.

http://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/corona-virus/transmission-of-covid-19-by-asymptomatic-cases.html Except Justin Trudeau Everything Ted Cruz is, done, wayyyy worse throwing there. What's sad Orange County's uptick positive cases happening wealthy Karen cities. happening low-income communities multi-generational families living one roof get by. Meanwhile, Karen republicans shriek hoax put communities danger they're oblivious conditions hardest hit cities. look noted relationship lingering loss smell/taste continuing test positive. Liberalism white working class scam. crooks sell hope minorities, voila, elevate middle class. Get smart education become even elitist. would rather Trump capitalism leveled everyone bar capitalist. would like see white middle class back working class competing even playing field. see white guilt goes.Obama may understood capitalism one. manager. well paid manager. cynicism. sneering. blatant elitism. people need free markets fund blood curdling free market parties West.

Also, ""superspreaders"" probably immune longer spreading. triggered importance community clearly ? sounds like men thing. karens white women experience, ill first admit limited may fair picture, thats sure see it. agree point, it’s reasonable. 

Unlike early days lockdown, , least state, furloughing doctors left right, keeping hospitals empty. Wish President, would 100× better off. Deaths suspected COVID cases tested, otherwise everyone coroners funeral directors could risk contracting disease. stop sports bubbles use labs general public thought safe. Oh, going do? end day, internal issues aren’t problem. Burdening us makes worse Republicans doing. That’s internal issue. side politics can’t figure — that’s Canada. 

By measure, leader isn’t even supported elite now. Likely won’t remain 6 months. then, it’ll likely late US.

65,000 cases day climbing. country cannot handle numbers. That’s reason got control ASAP. know, work largest hospital nation’s capital.

Killing us illegal intrusion seems extreme. KAREN WOULD LIKE SPEAK MANAGER floridian completely agree. safety honest ours. flooded northerners. kind person willing travel right really give shit keeping spreading. 

I'm kissimmee vacation rentals around house filling up. rental ban place actually nice here. People wore masks generally stayed away other. far enough south really southern state anymore. like north Florida protesting masks. barely tourists wearing masks. go grocery shopping always family 5 ass. It’s almost don’t read.

That think won’t cross 200k baffling, especially since we’re track lockdown.

And unlike you, hope I’m wrong. evidence thus far illustrates otherwise.

p.s. Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. Buttercup.  Ha ha! term now? *being Epsteined* Hong Kong... 50 new cases, closes Disneyland Hong Kong.

Florida... 15,000 new cases reported, opens Disney World day. Walking around nude public law, hear people complaining restricting freedom, people need climb back whatever bridge live shut F hard retain knowledge full year off.

It's commentary peer reviewed article. scholarly equivalent letter editor newspaper.

Further, coming months years many studies done, likely conflicting results. long time solid facts regarding this, cannot rule child-to-child spread disease vector prevailing consensus absent concrete evidence contrary foolhardy open schools juncture.

Some additional information:

From opinion piece Another possibility because
school closures occurred most
locations along before
widespread physical distancing
orders, close contacts became
limited households, reducing
opportunities children become
infected community and
present index cases.

This borne fact [Geneva ordered schools closed March according March 10 April 10, 2020, all
patients ,16 years old SARS-CoV2 infection identified means of
the Geneva University Hospital’s
surveillance network (Switzerland). seems hypocritical praise Gavin right now. Trump explicitly gave power handle pandemic governors, and, like Trump, Gavin threw away local leaders, furthering chain disharmony pandemic response regions people. 

That's called weak leadership top (President) leaves states coming many different uncoordinated plans effectively never suppresses Covid-19 country. Gavin one governors actually took serious steps suppress virus shutting issuing stay home orders. Last week, bars neighboring Placer county closed. county stayed open. Obviously, got flocked members neighboring county. thing happened 4th--coastal beaches closed, people flocked Lake Tahoe beaches. diffusing power obviously work.

You say thing State state movement infected Americans. Weak leadership top. Remember study said dumb people least likely think dumb? even thinking average intelligence? hoax guy primary example that. don’t hate it. expected better. know of. won’t survive long enough spread caught. fight society. leave alone hope getting favor back.

Also life fine, friends, family, eager help those. care society whole. Thanks nice know. Spread increase winter social distancing naturally reduces cold weather. 
In long term USA looks it’s eggs vaccination basket, problem enough American’s willing eat eggs. Tax hell rich. do. Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders right. Texas laws protecting employees? wear masks outdoors normalize it. figure people likely wear masks see people wearing masks. mean, new case numbers decreasing. second-highest day record, probably said. let jabronies get down. recently read study said takes 7 minutes close contact contract Covid. article correlates exactly Still sent bad social modeling signal - protestors approving media - even single person got infected. ""There's thousands people protesting streets can't birthday party?"" ""County Board Education"" - kind ironic guys represent Education consider retarded decision is. see he's got Merkel's finger glue. thanks. really desire go there.  Real life Dolores umbridge. Sad. protestors crammed together tight quarters weeks. Hundreds thousands time places. spikes perfectly align protests, isn’t getting attention reason Word mamacitas, Brochacho They'll used shoot people try enforce mask policies. Wow, like villain straight comic book. Call Trump Virus make eat it. There's sugar tomato soup, fries, milk, salad dressing. Try looking ingredients things. Salt sugar everything even need be. Recommend find transfer another school district ASAP, preferably one take virus seriously make sure safety maximized much possible, preferably nearby San Diego Los Angeles. 

She available get tenure taught two years. I’ve read thoughts virus, let share experience people around me:

I work warehouse supply side construction, Texas means work wonkiest wonky fucking batshit conspiracy theorists think entire thing plandemic, think 19 strains shit already (why it’s called COVID-19), think whole thing made up. Construction os essential business. never stopped working even shut down. counter regular retail. wasn’t mandated way building mask people started wearing mask. lots possibility exposed people’s idiocy; even though try take necessary precautions.

I girlfriend immunocompromised. far, she’s done decent job staying relatively isolated kept vitamins supplements everything possible boost immune system. said, there’s still possibility people don’t want fucking listen.

My girlfriend’s mother tested positive Covid weekend. started diarrhea fever turned diarrhea, high fever, body aches, splitting headache, inability taste smell, inability catch breath. She’s 55. husband, girlfriend’s father, thought bullshit fucking leveled wife.

My doctor cardiologist, pulled back treating patients Covid. seeing people 30s come leveled thing. Based patients she’s seen conversations she’s doctors working almost capacity hospitals (and many), rise San Antonio people aged 28-41. people age range dying, problem getting worse. San Antonio isn’t bad Houston Dallas/Fort Worth. hasn’t stopped mayor San Antonio turning Freeman Coliseum makeshift hospital.

It affected work too. driver’s brother lives Dallas died Covid. It’s affected friend group. old roommate’s aunt 40s died Covid. It’s church, yet people still show without masks.

So no, I’m going pretend like it, don’t. I’ll continue taking necessary precautions encouraging others same. isn’t something sarcastically write off. Belittling Covid doesn’t make less serious damaging. hope one else near affected this, stupid fucksticks still want downplay severity highly contagious virus is, continue spread, can’t guarantee that. tuition was... free... mhmmmm smoking? DeSantis good job. work San Marcos? One year need every true American help pitch rebuild country.

Because sure fuck going get help 60 million sore loser racist assholes busily crawling back rocks. fucking start arresting people violate orders I'm one saying vaccine (once developed) takes year distribute? doubt that. Gyms breeding ground Covid. worst thing could doing. IMO Teachers parents across U.S. going strike. go first path forward allowed businesses stay open masks, data driven opening decisions, massive amounts testing contact tracing.

We decided that. Introduction

A BLM protest? giving shit. probably died old age. Clickbait ""doom gloom"", sheesh... C'mon white house... midst European asian countries already wearing masks seeing results.

The man lied us. Oh - reddit comments killing anybody... doin ok buddy? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* remember telling people already hot Florida going away. got called sorts stuff. Well suppose could argue that’s possibly case. may well lack evidence effective preventing transmission however. think probably balance, advising people wear masks start allowed hospitals able keep supply’s coming probably greater good. Although great credibility CDC unprecedented times, it’s difficult get everything right. Needs /s close reality Look also Obama handled H1N1 lol, good thing deadly contagious Yeah cases rates countries great. also seem take much seriously. 

Meanwhile England... absolutely correct remember watch press conference Coronavirus Florida going see State officials wearing masks.  guess it’s stabilizing.. imagination. Cause sure hell can’t see stabilizing going down. reconcile number Japans wildly successful 40% reduction almost full mask compliance? basis make claim ? Ofc, heat humidity extent beneficial curbing spread lack ACs ? mean India doesnt air conditioning, cases still rising. dad refused wear one accident. refuses wear masks.

lol Jesus christ.  Yes hundreds thousands Americans cant die second wave let first one kill million two. Galaxy brain pandemic response honestly USA #1 Florida entered chat know shit serious put restrictions religious people really wants call ‘fucking idiots’. “think”. know lot people went small private colleges, place lot people. Lots small schools going destroyed financial networks ride out. pony too. Oh common, independent trump. Trump doesn’t know fuck going Thank gods state run morons. Mostly. Awesome. guy wait times bad.

He suspected case nursing home outbreak. Yup. really question? Europe sure waves handle first one well enough Please don’t, you’re giving flashbacks Brad Pitt Inglorious Basterds. Dude completely cloud fog....

you said person dies heart attack obesity killed them

yet catch Covid, cannot clear obesity, Covid killed obesity...you making sense

if young girl 120 lbs would alive day, Covid kill her, obesity did....

that saying, Covid deadly, health individual kills Covid enters equation

Do really Obese, severely Obese people, really think normal healthy? 

enough said tired trying make point Yeah 'Rump lackeys seem law point. ""Today Krogers grocery store, man stomped feet, threw tantrum cursed employees, asked ~~donate kidney~~ wear mask."" First all, panic attack ""minor inconvenience"". ever one, know that.

Secondly, study describes ineffectiveness wearing face masks British Medical Journal. doubt read it, news headline, I'll post say wear one asymptomatic, link article talks exceedingly rare asymptomatic transmission really is.

http://www.emro.who.int/health-topics/corona-virus/transmission-of-covid-19-by-asymptomatic-cases.html

And another study acknowledges outside people working close proximity patients, masks basically really think everyone can't wear mask one reason another selfish prick can't handle stay inside? people jobs? people depend them? kidding, obviously even understand much damage lockdown causing, otherwise favour it. favour measures literally causing children die hunger, mental health rapidly deteriorate, people life threatening illnesses like cancer put hold, yet I'm selfish prick. say quarantine got sick? people literally make shit argument. hilarious.

Keep living fantasy land want, lockdown criminal, favour absolutely position judge anyone's Enough nonsense.

 could understand, statistically, mean. 

That aside, operation warp speed 300 million doses end 2021. means it’s true, America enough vaccines population 17 months now. 

If it’s true. Government incompetence personal ignorance encourage pull 60 minutes interview right context - look better. Many, many, many nations already wearing masks seeing positive effects like Dr. Reality. America need cheerleaders.

Brandish - wave flourish (something, especially weapon) threat anger excitement.

Flourish - (of person) wave (something) around attract attention others.

According actual definitions word brandishing. kept holstered never initiated draw stroke, never waved it. articulate hostile action/hostile intent. article never even mentions touching weapon using hand positive control it. open carry state, visible weapon default crime.

In states like Florida, yes crime, visible print legally concealing it. scenarioa exceptions hunting fishing, traveling from.

that's faulty logic. can't understand saying.

regardless, Palestinians single origin historic connection country (vast majority, all), fine. Israel still willing conduct peace talks hand homeland silver platter. say yes.

i know many Palestinians personally. better people, less. many kind intelligent, not. thing common wanting raise families peace, make living worry much politics. Palestinian leadership failed provide people. Gaza, ended Hamas revolution. 

why can't Palestinians Rabin Begin? must stuck likes Arafat Abu Mazen? sucks. can’t find statistics people one year less, based death rates people 0-17 chances death less 0.1%. absolutely take precautions one awful people go time without mask, present reaction sounds extremely unhealthy mental health perspective.

One gem meeting last week ended debate we'd allow students use restrooms keeping everyone safe. it, ask safety US, based poor Covid response. Somebody first case....

Hence cops verbally state things like ""stop resisting"" ""dont reach weapon"". absolutely difference officer catching assault murder charges vs something ruled justifiable violence. 

The cops work city directed city tend things open massive lawsuit violation protected rights. arrested charged prosecuted resulting guilty verdict. man brain would file lawsuit false imprisonment, well weapon stripped force, would win likely lesser amount settlement. win situation.

Increased hospitalizations equal increased deaths. half new cases concentrated three states hospitals getting overwhelmed. I’m saying increase cases isn’t bad, is, severity clearly decreased good thing.

...Also doctors sneakily adding covid death certificates, would increase confirmed death toll go completely argument, clearly that’s I’m saying. Like stocking books, financials. people got English degrees would fail sixth grade math. DeSantis goes: nooooooooooormal think everyone's moving back home? anti-maskers too? guess difficult social distance job properly hooker ""That would breaking news""

Ok, Putin’s interest Trump becoming president based self-interest many reasons don’t think need discuss here. But, Trump’s end, likely ignorant facilitator (puppet) rather actively soliciting Putin’s help granted already.

As accomplishments, wasn’t 10s millions started with.  well 400m, memory serves, got father. shown simply stuffed 400m index funds, would made money actually did. Instead, he’s managed fail every single business venture he’s touched, including casinos, extremely hard do.

US banks business all. go banks outside US secure kind financing. failed *that* much, younger years, mental decline, actual wealth still much question (let’s see tax returns).

Now, *in thick mental decline,* you’re trying say he’s smart enough actually plan long-term strategy remove pension recipients. strategy would require understanding things like actuarial tables, morbidity mortality statistics, logistics, education facilities probability analyses, financial market fund analyses forecasts, etc., tying together create actionable policy strategy across multiple sectors industry society.

You think guy capable now, even ever? One professors Wharton undergrad said dumbest students he’s ever had.

During presidency, repeatedly shown he’s capable anything concerned immediate gratification. thinks way highly doesn’t believe people see idiot actually is.

That’s trying strong arm Democrats budgetary concessions 2018, thinking amazing it’s going forces Pelosi Schumer capitulate front national TV. wanted embarrass them, tried paint children, saying he’ll take blame government shutdown, it’ll (and Republicans’) fault. national TV.

Maybe stop prolonging inevitable get naturally immune economy completely ruined? Thank curve flattened... Upwards. Considering insane spikes ""pneumonia"" deaths shown states, id willing bet there's undercounting overcounting It’s testing. testing causing ICUs overflow.  math, using data reported, precent death going 3% 6%.

There’s strong correlation biggest protest cities (Seattle, NYC, DC, Chicago, etc) cities biggest spikes month (Dallas, Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix, etc)

I don’t know (maybe outdoor gatherings wearing masks aren’t high risk?) it’s pretty clear protests didn’t cause significant spike. pubs round make sit order drinks app, actually pretty compliant fucking dumb be. people arguing? ❤️ Cuomo *looks username*

Agreed Politicizing public health. Sickening. agree, go down. example, Vietnamese illegal alien, visited one Itaewon clubs, took anonymous test leave phone number. test result turned positive later health authority tried contact turned phone submerged.

A policewoman, born Vietnam naturalized Korea, tried call text repeatedly, persuading promising amnesty finally responded.

The health authority managed identify roommates, tested negative fortunately. also turned visited another nightclub He's stupid. went Harvard Law.

The man psychopath. Gov. Ron DeathSentence ready sacrifice many floridians takes restart economy many Trump lovers want ""Freedom die"".. Taxing Spending clause means dictate people states must must wear. 

Edit: Apparently also appears preamble, held legislative power. saying could brought Larry around time instead wearing mask? Oh man, spooky controlling ""They"".

I think probably stop responding people, making case better lmao mask mandate state legal. Case precedent miles long hundred plus years old.

By feds? unconstitutional open shut. worth mentioning. 10th amendment.

Yes... piece paper matters. didn’t would cascade far larger problems virus.

It sounds good people suggest things unless it’s possible it’s big waste time think about. People sound legally illiterate it’s bad look anti mask crowd, different way.

Give downvotes want. answer is: we’re guessing. many us doomed. 

Meanwhile New Zealand ended quarantined island ZERO cases. Anyone want guess many years it’ll take us get there? Oh it’s survey. see don’t really understand scientific research works. It’s meta-analysis, largely considered strongest form scientific evidence. it’s quite reliable information. Within article access individual study thorough scrutiny evidence wish so. studies actual analyse effectiveness single layer cloth masks less effective multi-layer but, again, better mask. 

And it’s Lancet, course peer reviewed. hate guy, man. saw tweet shared separate thread too. Unreal! Here’s Move 150k+ dead American caskets room Trump followers, watch cheer. That's great - sacrifice children three hours entertainment every Friday night expense. 

Ohio cradle idiocy. need use larger round. ++P helps too. stupid *and* stubborn. Good know. make great republican. Less testing!! there's stay home, close entertainment, people gonna private parties. would recommend travel right now. Corona defeated yet. Americans used fight die countrymen. people pass paranoia selfishness ‘freedom’. SMH. starters, would expect anything less US?

Also, AFAIK death counted 'covid' death Florida, patient tested positive covid first. Flordia hit testing limit days people wait weeks. Go figure. Given current status, anyone feels like might infected stay home 2-3 weeks--not US employers would generally support decision, test positivity rate 25%+, least people could try fix this. fucking crazy much easier sphere-shaped aunt shop decent clothes in-person tall, healthy-weight older brother, still order much clothing online. Fake beard less reliable data all. Died stroke covid? died covid then. remember report Italy death toll inflated Take look around you. already is. getting data? CDC predicting 0.2-1%.

Source: CAN'T FATHER GET INTERVIEW ALREADY MOVE COLORADO family viruses. flu sense least 10 times deadlier. one believes 1% population die though. Yep, people say learn youtube videos, encounter something actually need learn degree, complicated fuck boring hell. 

Like this, 

 Let's guess 20 under? Sugar preservative well. can't fill hospital COVID-19 cases, require much care. Usually cases looking 1:4 best (1 nurse 4 patients). There's way could hospital full 1:4 cases -- would completely collapse. that's generous, severe COVID cases 1:2. Haha shade doe Love story. Never thought would relevant. Scary omen US collapses. 

China, Russia, scary. Many classes solely online years. Online learning college new Spanish Flu: ""I'm GOAT""
COVID-19: ""Hold beer"" point say incompetence malfeasance government breached side social compact? it? fine place people without mask. governor stripped power. Masks mandatory Canada closed damn country next year. Many Americans can't follow damn rules give options.. ""come contact someone covid"" self-quarantine due symptoms 2 weeks, keep repeating that, what's going happen? like guy keep saying increase deaths US even spike cases. new cases mainly lower age group? 3,200,000 full-time teachers U S. 2020. Accepting CFR of.4%, 12,800 teachers would die. number take account staff school-custodians, cafeteria staff, counselors, administrators, resource officers, paraeducators, etc. Lol. thousands people close contact street problem. 

But dozen hundred bar problem?

What kind logic that? guess that's true. Brazil seems ""main"" outlier though know enough comment American mindset Brazilian mindset may may similar regard.

Does anyone know got Bolsonaro elected presumably still somewhat popular? Canada used ""look up"" US? mean said this? going ticket shit outta guy throwing house party. Yup, substantial containment efforts place countries. we'd treating like normal flu whole time... oof. Going yet? Congratulations wife! Exactly. I’m Michigan everyone area gets results back 24 hours less. Hard good testing tracing let virus run wild. That's never intended two party system. Framers modeled Confederate system British Parliament, several parties time. majority rule voting/ veto / impeachment system assumed political division would negligible three participant parties.

Unfortunately, drafting Articles Confederation failed provide U.S. government powers needed sustain Union. subsequent redrafting current Constitution created divide Federalists Anti-Federalists. simplify, two main factions developed evolved time shitstick we're holding now.

Athletics nothing higher education learning. countries university education sports all. Instead, people join club leagues. Tuition much affordable too. Pretty fucked up, university free get student benefits 0% interest loans cover living costs. There's student apartments subsidized, completely separate university. think rent one need like 1 course per semester, apply random course finish want stay student apartment. Actually, continuing pay private schooling zoom lessons 5 kids per class. can't imagine teachers public schools handle 25 kids per class zoom session. That's dumb get: Italy barely seen numbers last month cases still rising. Yup.

That’s real shocker might guns blazing clearly haven’t chosen right guns. right wing talking points. Hospitalizations way way up, deaths ticking up, deaths already said she’s going get house parents. know she’s going.  Exactly. “Meh. 99% survival rate” see sometimes. Truth fighting infectious disease. virus showed US incapable organizing basically anything people incapable acting selflessly / one, even means mass death inside country threatens everyone's life. likely downfall US bio-warfare. Absolute insanity. I'm sorry countrymen leaders letting good people right thing. restrictions two states due less 300 cases, 96% one state (outbreak) tighter restrictions part, one wants end position US. Horrifying. point it’s well deserved. little respect don’t wear mask it’s another two weeks record infections hope get virus. It’s way going learn. sounds cold I’m fucking done. Yep.

Also, still understand immunity COVID works even tests theory 100% accurate I'd place safe continue calling vulnerable loved ones instead visiting play safe. went grocery store Lakewood yesterday saw two people without masks. whelming majority people masking seems around here. wrong protesters sides going big crowds. now. first shop recently shut voluntarily avoid dealing garbage people preponderence current scientific evidence medical research clearly shows dietary fat cholesterol consumed non-processed (industrially) sources (i.e. plants, meats, etc.) harmful fact, healthy eaten moderation context balanced diet.

We retarded society incapable research think fear virtue. read tested negative meth escort one using meth. 

Well can't find articles saying tested negative idk maybe I'm wrong. even mean? want call fight war COVID, take money military/defense budget pay people stay home. pay taxes government protect us, far they're interested protecting wallets. person illiterate can’t comprehend data. He’s sub spewing nonsense. Best ignore agree, right. always call FM/Peds physician confirm. Get tested quarantined. want spreading whatever around. 

Good cautious level-headed. Devos wants replace public schools private. gets infect teachers students virus icing cake her. add protests list??? Experts told us protests cause COVID infections. correct statement - determined protective factor is.  for...three first responders? Probably sustainable without eventually collapsing economy? Exactly. honest, doubt market ever truly free. Every single add one sees manipulation attempt.

Public healthcare's interest get rid patients. really is, budget. Public healthcare says customer ""it nice visited us, please never come again"". profit healthcare's interest get rid patients. says customer ""thank choosing us, please come again"". Personally favor alcohol ban seems miss timed actually gonna make 2nd wave? That’s idiotic. Anything specified federal power Constitution authority states - way around. don’t king, President cannot it. 

Any state wanted could tell President pound sand, wouldn’t shocked others might agree still would choice words President trying thing. fact people allowed fly without mask flying probably many years. would interested Trump's plan. would like hear details area. done prevent transmission, much testing. hear Jan Hammer soundtrack already! ability reserved Steven Stamkos Nikita Kucherov thought said last week, week that, week that...

Meanwhile Florida went straight tourism dollars instead something reliable. Crazy. Reopening Disney... I’ll honest, didn’t actually know protests about. assumed (perhaps wrongly) something mask mandates given context response. What's point shutting down? goal create safe environment inside bubble, thus far successful. think uber social popular basketball players worse effect world they're roaming around outside way protected bubble? Proven kill virus patients

proven read news lately. every single outlet came hydroxychloroquine recant studies said killed people falsified

so yeah, maybe keep current yaketty yak seem like Dr. Fauci pushing back Trump lately? think see things becoming desperate desperate measures need taken taken Trump. think he's pushing Trump fire him, he'll without constraint.

I sure hope Dr. Fauci careful, know, going near windows upper floors. Instructions unclear. 2 half masks 100% reduction. Two. One point hole exposed. 1 3 Americans make rent mortgage payment July 1 federal unemployment add-on ending. Homelessness may skyrocket September/October nothing changes.

Hysteria finest. you’re born January 1st 1997, 4 years old 9/11 happened there’s difference kind memory event able cognitively process magnitude. oldest gen z’s may possibly memories would able realise independent going on, whereas 14 year old millennial would have. 

For me, that’s big difference gen z millennials events like that. Similarly 2008 economic recession. Millennials directly affected many finishing high school/college whereas gen z still elementary school result also couldn’t process magnitude. Like I’m born 1997 (albeit almost 1998) analyse upbringing versus siblings (peak millennials), can’t relate all. remember time google YouTube, don’t. recognise monumental iPhone released, didn’t. remember pre-9/11 world, don’t. used MySpace Netscape remember dial up. still don’t even know dial works. 

Similarly touch smartphone thing, don’t remember time smartphones, it’s smartphone know changed forever iPhone. mum sony ericsson smartphone 2003 (the P900) touch screen internet Bluetooth cameras. smartphone first real exposure mobile technology back 5. Also many millennials using flip slide phones high school school, people literally iPhones since 6th grade wasn’t iPhone blackberry. experts say 0 cases Covid-19 spread protest. Everyone wore mask stayed least 6 feet away Protest perfectly safe, Experts say... Except Nerf Air Guns. Absolutely agreed Start arrest ppl.

Send report admin, contact reddits advertisers explain site allows users abused less people see ADs. enough people contact advertisers stuff like see mods get banned. Lebron dialed in, Mickey locked loaded, hasn’t shark attack week. guns blazing! said.

But also think super naive even experts assume would act like Spanish Flu Covid shaping airborne aids talk like this. anti maskers stopping listening medical scientific advice ignoring worst medical crisis lives? Generally curious. failure education system believing every stupid fucking idiotic conspiracy read Facebook? federal state governments taking care citizens can't work due deadly global pandemic like countries developed world. fact crazed madman diametrically opposed helping Americans deadliest natural disaster history nation separate issue restaurants dangerous unnecessary place open deadly pandemic. hard understand.

Source: American math science Facebook discussions Complete fantasy lmao read errors were? Multiple labs reported 100% positive rates. sub, anything even slightly promoting idea normality bashed hell of. Thank this. I’ll definitely try make college experience using resources I’m given. ask coming from. assume state coming adjacent state, might ask visited states list. think robot. So, that's roughly 100 human lives we're counting adult employees Orange County School District. considering family members children get infected, children themselves. that's current infection numbers, inevitably spike schools reopen. yeah, pretty terrible decision around. Sorry downvotes. hear you. Democrats easily win many elections batshit crazy ideas generally disruptive economy. Bill Clinton even Obama pretty solid understanding economics capitalism. 

The next gen, AOC Squad, royally fucked WEARING MASKS. correct. Birx one said this, DeVos. think Vice President covered incredibly well. know mortality rate 25 CDC data less 0.1 percent. know many infected, evidence significant mortality children without coexisting diseases. that’s we’re looking right now, really make sure we’ve unturn- — overturned every rock understand deep detail.

This mean though 100% willing reopen knowing children potentially going die. care, affect them. SERIOUSLY, crazy. STOP killing people money. best news weeks right Like what? Haha. Surprise surprise. wasn’t fucking smart pop bunch crotch goblins all. Imagine surprise

/s new, sounds like opposite definitely agree. I'm salesman homebuilder Texas. Despite shutdown, still wanted us model homes. matter fact made us put sign front model home call schedule instant appointment, since Texas state realtors work appointment. thought sleezy company this, realtors definitely essential, behavior caused spread Covid actually shutting businesses said aware this. tried stupid saying ""thanks public school!"" 

Honestly pointless comment figured someone offended might well remove it. Don’t worry. UofT sucks. 

It’s call UofTears. Yup. That's pretty republican thing important message Nov. Thank you! ""As mentioned before, exposure true information matter anymore. person demoralised unable assess true information. facts tell nothing, even shower information, authentic proof, documents pictures. ...he refuse believe it... That's tragedy situation demoralisation.""
–Yuri Bezmenov [1983 lockdowns Nah fuck that. Rubio capitulated allowed trump shit Constitution. He's bad rest them. Maybe worse tries act like he's better he's another lap dog. Yeah, wonder, back row rollercoaster, likely airborne particles riders front going hit face? 

It one reason go jogging trails. People wear masks run they're running right breaths everyone six feet directly front them. know Fauci said goes jogging without mask. course, mutation fully airborne. something like 10 feet recommended distancing now. doubt cloth/paper masks much crowded room anymore. 

The comparison think BLM protests. positive testing something like 1%. real danger seems everyone went indoor bars, restaurants, churches, night clubs, movie theaters. Especially Arizona, indoors heat intense. 

I want clarify **NOT** going amusement parks. I've rarely gone outside. watch lot videos formally industry. I'd interested know outdoor amusement park transmission going like BLM bars? quarantine 14 days. 

Masks mandatory. Please close job. don’t enforce shit we’re danger. shitheads like deserve covid fucking die. garbage like endangering people actual brain common sense. symptoms occur 2 10 days infected. average 5 days. infectious 2 days symptoms appear 14 days after. He's day 6 so. r/sino shambles one simple trick! I’m Canadian personally keep tabs America want shit. 

I want fulfill life long dream moving warm city fuckers keep up, I’ll never get move California vetoed extremely unaffordable. Medicare would cost projected $3.2 **trillion** dollars year *on top existing healthcare expenditures.* going need something nearly double govenrment expenditure. Bernie needs come realistic public insurance scheme.  ramping fast point time. would sure 400k ceiling anymore. general immunity last 9 12 weeks, I'd say functional vaccine unlikely.

I think confusing immunity detectable antibody levels. Antibody levels drop infections they've gone away. immunity lasted 9–12 weeks, see way grand total zero symptomatic reinfections 13 million cases worldwide. hi colorado resident i’m Texas wanted travel trinidad pick weed come back day. still allowed? We're calling stupid, saying statistically likely. Mitch McConnell competition big box utterly destroyed. massive corporations remaining this. Amazon Nestle rule world. They'd ignorant fuckwits then, Hunduism polytheistic. BBQ place KC. guarantee wasn’t one gun there. must one lifetime recessions. Can’t wait next one :’) Disney Resort opened yesterday? infections coming weeks... Yo, earth red hat crowd think Dr's take economy really valuable near total consensus entire medial scientific community *science* bullshit? special kind crazy. Hmm. wonder would done cashier immediately opens cash register starts emptying cash bag tosses counter. I’m allowed enforce mask rule store work at. county wide mandatory mask policy. also don’t capacity limit. 

The thing allowed put sign door. 

It’s children’s clothing store therefore cesspool times. I'm going learn click...thank you!  every state expanded Medicaid, absolutely help unemployed. Kentucky Medicaid open people lose jobs covid emergency (was last time heard talked about, anyway). love prominent people highest positions power United States effectively saying:

“Woopsie” I'm glad know names inevitable happens know. US Wuhan day, let sink in. Florida man thought chosen local level voting? wish power CCP daddy. definitely good idea.



Theres chance good idea. Duuuh, statistics never 100% accurate always error factor taken account numbers predetermined percentage. Statistic definition educated estimate based input data situation. Feel like I’ve read comment 7000 times 300 deaths per 1M population CO 115 deaths per 1M population TX. Weird logic works. needs stay home... everyone! Yeah, op wtf. Yin yang twins LYFE Canadian here. Living Texas, America wife &amp; kid.
If Trump wins November, we’re selling house moving Toronto. Wonder healthcare investments look like fact medical community get behind Fauci even issue statement indication far wrong direction country leaning. like lame brains decided believe science expense possibly destroying health, putting jeopardy health lives innocent people around them. know what's worse, selfishness sheer stupidity. Y'all got rona? Lmao post gross over-exaggeration state United States. Like Daario Naharis guns hope enjoy dirty bomb. like pissed get lol wanted to. useless* governor forced reopen let close.

*A colorful word used automod like Site accessible Europe...why this? happens often reddit 😥 got marooned Japan Covid hit. I'm actively working making situation rather permanent. Yeah, real justice world. vaccine give longer protection overcoming disease. could potentially provide protection multiple stains. That's fact biology. Given flu strain mutation rate annual vaccination schedule, reason believe another coronavirus vaccine would effective. outsourced Canada 80's... Hi Florida Maybe owner wake looney tunes agent orange is. Doubtful, one hope. love you, guy. bromo. basically murder children families “probable” deaths rising. confirmed deaths. That’s don’t think second spike anywhere near bad. kind whole point worst over. know sure weeks, I’m optimistic. think point trying illustrate posting story. precisely he’s guilty mass murder, criminal negligence, whatever term appropriate describe somebody whose actions resulted death hundreds thousands human beings.

I sure fuck hope somebody position power preparing take trial this. 

I haven’t heard thing news it. sure hell hope it’s coming. intelligent take. Reminds article read 9/11 conspiracy theories believing wild stories way easier confronting fact foreign terrorist attack government essentially knew going happen nothing it, also communication government, FBI CIA complete shitshow. Basically giant communication failure spearheaded George Dumbya Bush. sub got rock hard. Everytime get close ending someone sub cums  Nope, Florida allow that, looked weeks ago. think virus always slightly airborne.

I think data know true, viruses mutate slowly, mutation parents, scientists correlating finding mutation evidence virus airborne.

This respiratory virus evolutionary means found way transmit respiration. might effect blood etc... it’s primary means infection inhalation virus.

Need remind bats don’t hands. California surpassed peak hospitalization earlier year. 

Not good. Nobody claimed able return normality. vaccine found, restrictions personal freedom new normal. least able reopen restaurants, bars, cinemas risk economic disaster hundreds thousands millions without risking health millions people. Hoo boy... if, miracle, works, fucking awesome, I'm pleasantly proven wrong. not, damn, unsurprising. then, I'm hoping get jabbed Christmas Oxford one. would convey them? I'm lost hypocrisy unreal. spend billions TSA avert billion chance terrorist attack occuring yet openly allow idiots spread deadly virus almost certainly kill people. public school teacher trying best give students best education can, exhausting see people constantly complaining taught. interested topic, pick book 🤷 

Honestly, might little sensitive sacrifices we're asked make right returning classroom amid pandemic. hard feel valued professional, simultaneously blamed things students wish learned. Well, facts. ridicolous claim science standards Russia inferior to, example, chinese ones.  nothing capitalist, since subsidies restrictions everywhere. There’s chance might survive this? knew bullshit fear mongering /s  would grow pair make decision, decision own, best people what’s best Trump wouldn’t bad. Yeah perform Covid swabs. contamination stay surgical mask makes us feel better re-using N95s. well sealed N95 require additional protection, extra layer hurt, especially half us fail mask fitting test even knows sealing N95s properly. can't really tell without professional seal test. Yet anything changed far? (Except damage done brick mortar stores) watching Fox News. Never has. 
The amount infected much much higher reported cases. fatality rate way lower think. 

Future debt, man made economic crisis fear kill take lives prematurely virus will. Average age deaths Sweden 82, virus. Sweden countries barely excess deaths year, meaning, died would died anyway year. know downvoted. There's reason selected ECG first place, article addresses actual point.

But yeah, neither know patients already ill (or getting there) otherwise actually healthy (as opposed knowing ill were). Doubt there's way controlling unless mass study see gets ill future. really correct. issued closures, lock downs, mask orders. state-wide. 

I'm supporting guy read executive orders also live PBC I've living it.

I say mask orders federal level issued back March. mean 5 weeks long enough see start really spike surely? Unless they're put deaths like pneaumonia? People downvoted saying looks quite possible majority U.S. citizens would infected/recovered/removed August. take number deaths apply assumed case fatality rate (1 thousand), looks like 100M total infections happened already. I'm inclined agree you, empathetic part still want mass death happening. Even though god left us hot car die, still need shakily keep *some* principles, y'know. 😜 ""The customer always right."" &lt;--This shite needs die right effen now. created mentality able get away anything. customer always right toxic customer bad business. worked specialty grocer one customer used come in. gross, wiping snot produce dry goods, eating wings wing bar leaving bones around store. Staring kids. Standing deli counter getting free samples everything. Anything bought returned next day bs reasons, short, guy lost us money customer. got banned store level appealed corporate won. know 100 instances long term customers first time potential customers complained said taking business elsewhere. customers spent average $250 week store keep one guy pain ass lost $25,000 potential sales EVERY WEEK companies wonder sales going shitter online taking over. create movement vote third party? thing really could change U.S. IMO. point breaking everything select next meme president.  -3.3% cuz Soros picks bill. They’ll get silenced country “Freedom Speech” almost like microbial resistance catching something believe young voters causing issues. Interesting hypothesis. really say ‘tatters’ Yup. Perfect example Trump gave jobs rich friends fall line say whatever wants. don't, we've seen, replaces them. Flu. Dissappear. Hoax. Bla bla. Fuck. Yeah setup Newsom timeshare?

You guys 2 weeks, need Florida.

Hurricanes coming... XD military useful here? Need send medical professional instead Difference rate overall low Europe. Florida different matter. vulnerable bio-warfare. 

I thinking - every country know easy would destroy us something far sinister COVID-19. Haha, that's kind funny could keep going shutdown started problems reopening. Although, infection rate hospital staff lower community, maybe makes little sense. :D they're going wear masks they're certainly going wear face shields America anti-facist?

Have told veterans? \*Sigh vaccine that's available PLA use, Ad5-nCoV start phase 3 trial Brazil 6 days 9000 volunteers.

So see there's legit phase 3, emergency military use thing that, emergency limited scope. Yep, long people actually get tests aren’t getting drowned scared people using testing. Like miracle. crucial right first time. severe within 21st century.. far! I’m lucky graduated June 2019. Run distrust Russian.

I distrust radar all, suddenly, definitely going here, going great despite getting single-stage, small-scale trial only.

They also say they're going ""launch"" one seems clarified suggested scale it'll launched.

Obviously hope successful sounds like Oxford could put release May restricted trivial things like clinical testing.  20? teach high school, try least 120. I've years 200 students. Well fear. rT value 1 states, think eight states reported increase 150% positive tests last week. Whatever combined weekly total was, least many next two weeks.

Only measures taken California Texas start mitigating effect. Plus one poster; tap water Western Europe good Idiots like come reddit echo chamber confirm biases attack people dare question whole covid thing. Chances work bubble, people like work outside realize shit going away chances many millions  know there’s PLENTY people flying non-essentials. needs tightened like vice grip. Whoever elected Trump. got wanted wish, hermit! ;) extra boost general immune function illnesses lasts around year vaccines explains people protected life illness yet notice kids less likely die infection year TB vaccine. Also TB vaccines vary potency 1,000 x potency depending made country.

Here's hoping something works even coronavirus vaccine tomorrow enough everyone would least vaccines could given risk folks proven protective least reduces severity lasting damage covid. video ventilators beeping full COVID ICU enough freaked Italy back March. bodies loaded back moving truck Brooklyn mass graves dead poor afford burials. Research still one. yet enough time pick results wonder happen teachers quit. 

There's already huge teacher shortage since get underpaid AF. saw anti masker online say people tell that, doesn’t believe people scrunch eyes. conspiracy goes far. Winter coming. CPA really matter go public accounting. would never hire someone CPA. hire CPAs almost always come public accounting, much effective someone came staff position private company. us sociopaths feel bad them. flu mild though, 2017 flu actually quite bad Covid even caught globally yet.

You're comparing confirmed deaths covid estimated total flu deaths. Also, deaths covid happened shorter period containment efforts place.

In US, around 61k flu deaths 2017-18 season. 138k deaths covid US far. done good job containment gives us idea much worse even bad flu season, even they've done way ever flu. NYC gotten control death toll would way, way look excess mortality less dependent testing, least Sweden 1993 2000 influenza years worse Covid.

Covid still ongoing final figures compare yet. Source: Facebook post also says bill gates devil bottom. Expected graph showing many times Europe fits Florida response. 


Was dissapoint.  took intro ocean sciences class college, gen ed credits. book required buy class actually professor’s book. Cost $100 something clearly printed home computer put together one plastic spiral binders used elementary school art projects. People need start asking people power many deaths need hands/conscience actually act take seriously.

Their actions directly responsible huge outbreaks states, fuck civil they're trying kill people. shit looks like funny game, Plague INC... looks fucking rigged.... show lose job ended able pay bills. understand position would screwed sign thumbnail mention mayor? took away ""iffy"" ""death Covid"" deaths, seniors killed sending Covid homes, wonder death toll would be? 100,000? 80,000? Abbott test Quest, currently accurate nearly 100% sensitivity 99.6% specificity, contrary media sensationalism reporting, decent evidence antibodies last. good test says antibodies, chances immunity. understand frustration would worse gives false positive. cell tests used research right now. really, he's blaming others failing.  one, serology antibody tests known produce 50% false positives. CDC instructing policy makers make policy based results serology labs.

For two, generating IFR based estimates infection rate using prevalence antibodies donating blood transfusions. Extrapolating infection rates healthy adults venturing public donate applying cohort children ostensibly isolated since schools shut since March isn’t going result best data set either.

However it’s worth repeating CFR China folks younger 10 actually *0%*. seems everyone, even party, ignoring now. He's treated like lame duck pres already. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m curious well. 

I also wonder fauci doesn’t resign make appearances news outlet chooses? saying wants say wants say it. Definitely coz 
1. can’t go back words
2. can’t look foolish front people
3. can’t antagonize Trump
4. doesn’t know do
5. doesn’t know covid is
6. doesn’t know fuck becomes 
7. Forever loop ! Yeah, riots tens thousands people streets cities around country month ago pro-Trump... I'm defending ""jackasses"" talking about, though. I'm saying, none shit helped. older 60%, generally   recently upped requirements become dietician well. Noe must master's degree. Instead US Treasury Department sent dead grandpa letter bragging would get one time check $1200 giant shitty Trump signature bottom. 

That priority. Reminds lot Brain, Pinky Brain, ran John Brain. know, feel dude. I'm Spain supposed celebrating birthday today Florida. I'm watching US horror tbh. Depends country Florida reporting pneumonia deaths, numbers pneumonia deaths way way higher Past years, many speculate covered up. wanted president precisely undo Obama era policies fine contact information? Testing bottle-necking too, there's real guarantee data up-to-date, even consistent. lot people work home financial aid easily want sacrifice family.. wish give up. Give help easier cheaper way giving up. Even giving costs.. Anyone know ran challenge trials? Otherwise seems highly unlikely enough time study effiecy. spent fraction giant $2T bailout mass testing masks, say, $100B, ""mere"" 5%, we'd much better off.

Yes, trivial quickly ramp production complicated materials like testing reagents meltblown fiber, but, holy crap, $100B buy lot. American liberals: stop police violence, defund police!

Also American liberals: want government shut entire economy forcefully keep people home, would course require use robust policing stop parties mass gatherings! Many people wear masks stay home, voluntarily.  enough not, epidemic still raging.  fraction people wear masks, small. convince people wear masks, require order government. couple months ago Florida should’ve closed, period, closed NY travelers.  I’ve taken online teaching class I’m GTA fall. newborn I’d online class. whatever reason decided main prof lectures would recorded GTAs lead 4 sessions 50 min long discussion sections (on someone else’s material/not even discipline) one day week. 

It’s stupidest thing I’ve ever heard. can’t even get kids talk 50 min person I’m supposed get involved zoom? can’t even groups anything either?? waste. They’re going come. makes feel better, applied march 15th get first payments last week April.

They backdated payments though made whole. Hopefully happens well mean... Health workers fucked used abused years France, covid arrived midst several year long fight protest pay rise hire government, one firing freezing salaries offering poor excuses compensation like "" organise overtime better...""

So know, saying vive la France applauding without reserve giving credit government France.... quite right either... Thank you, people taking vacation like pandemic really need called out. MT great solid month tourists came; bad wear mask home (my parents immunocompromised &amp; dad stage 3 COPD, take care &amp; husband &amp; help mortgage, utilities etc).

Stories like make angry, vacationing pandemic really feels like ""fuck you"" locals. I've part &amp; staying home months, husband &amp; can't afford stay home, work. Nobody NEEDS vacation right now. Sorry chose confusing wording. I’m talking anti mask protests, protestors wearing masks. word now

It talked Russian media though. call volunteers back May phase 1 started June.

By way, particular article mention it, release August imply mass-availability, provided phase 2 successful emergency authorization de facto phase 3 trials - little amount vaccine produced distributed (it's like research institution large-scale manufacturing capabilities produce couple tank wagons drug). Paid sick leave needs mandatory.

Universal healthcare needs implemented.

No obvious now. Oh, absolutely agree nothing proven way research needed. saying dangerous wait herd immunity happen; might never get there... charge that, hide it. /s would nice least closed indoor rides areas dedicated people take masks off. mask social distancing requirements, best enforced. washing surfaces nearly enough, offering plenty hand sanitizer hand washing stations. 

The thermal scanners really security theater. 100.3°F outer skin means internal temperature several degrees hotter. doubt going catch many infected. 


I mean, least they're *something*. still bad idea go many people, even though allowing fewer people parks. I'd consider Dr. Fauci goes. Fauci lie tho, literally say started masks work, hospitals would run Tbh Disney isn’t closing Hong Kong Disneyland. park majority owned government Disney company, government Hong Kong say whether open not. Hopefully like Trump rally everyone worried people show up. organizers dumb enough plan mean kids dumb enough arrive. shutdown social distancing contact tracing.

[citation needed] Yeah people really understand much party is. sport brings everyone together. I’d rather breathe mask ventilator personally. Looks like add another issue list things livable wage could help mitigate. Talk louder. I'm serious here, single disease trigger antibodies development memory cells? Well, least lets New Years Eve party end 2020 little early. 😂👍 Manitoba Canada 0 new cases awhile 1 active case whole province. Compare USA.... realistic outlook lives. think ever get back living normal life. whole situation devastating Thing expect children act like adults wear mask adults acting like kids refusing to.

I saw interview DeVos CNN didn’t clue resemblance plan.

There’s school districts everywhere saying enough space resources social distance children answer Miami well. 

Asked would best solution school open hotspot area kept towing party line “kids need schools” painful.

Children less likely get less likely get sick. two things fails address continently leaves out.

1. Teachers aren’t. Teachers interact parents children day. people interact always going wearing mask, think young kids parents don’t want rights infringed.

2. Less likely immune. believe stat saw estimated 12,000 children dying schools opened right now. Y'all Karen wonder you’re panic that’s you’re spreading amongst yourselves. 

Covid 0.26% without vaccine. 

Flu 0.1% vaccine. saw that, isn’t bit misleading? Although it’s proven yet double blind studies don’t cells still protect people? millions cases around globe yet handful suspected reinfections. fuck think bored-yo whitelivesmatter way similar? Wasnt lagging spain, Italy NYC. Im sure lagging narrative came from. Ah yes. always carry measuring tape wherever go. virus going months still officials refuse take serious large majority demanding actions either. feel bad Texans functioning brain, give 2 fucks rest loses lung 2 stupidity. say traveled Canada I? plan to. lax precautions, fine

Certainly seems like were: complaint alleges companies’ failure follow Centers Disease Control Prevention guidance processing facilities — social distancing meat processing lines, use personal protective equipment

And they're saying racist workers slaughterhouse floors (predominantly POC) ones contracting dying covid-19 due plants' failure keep safe, management (predominantly white) less impacted. stay home curbside pickup illegal follow airline rules instructions plane?  right. novel virus people learning something new everyday. least relaying WHO(whether right wrong another topic) healthcare bodies assessing point. making honest attempt update educate changing narrative try best job. 

And that, government trying malign him. unbelievable. video packed wedding Arkansas week old people singing “celebrate good times.” don’t know rip Facebook. video won’t age well. Comancho least listened experts. lucky. I'm super excited Trump know half half quarter. 4 every 3 people bad math..... 3 4? well imagine tremendous sorrow loved ones can't even must wait months able grieve properly funeral. Teaching different. less connected get less real-time feedback students. requires adjustment. I've taught graduate school many online webinars. Techniques different see resources made available instructors make transition. 

Further, children, opinion needs presence attention monitoring. privacy concerns trying automate teachers build opportunities presentation methodology. 

Schools GOT get Zoom. “Nobody knew healthcare could complicated.”

\- guy swear never said They’ll come back want job. Sounds cold right? “you’ll pay want degree”. There's way it'll come close black death even WITHOUT adjusting population growth. thing *literally* killed half Europe (30-60%). point cut Florida like gangrenous limb is? one teachers doesnt feel safe going back work organized it. wanted everyone get covid pool party need go back work 2 weeks later. im joking, but, can't think another explanation....  covid-19 getting long thought beginning... hope keep safe end Looks like hospitalized.

See mention, year, count actual deaths, millions. completely inaccurate describe Florida whole - entire Tampa Bay Area extremely diligent wearing masks. honestly don’t think I’ve seen one person wearing one out. fact, mandatory pinellas hillsborough county enforced teachers people people want money. Private schools draw best teachers. turn makes rich parents willing pay metric fuck-tonnes twerps attend.

It way unless government takes education pays teachers much higher wage stay.

Then maybe top 10% leaves country moves universities paid again. Yes, good point. surface level, vaccine actually effective, think western media surprised like surprised Sputnik launched. Whoops quick delete we’ve made! Dude got quick lol Serious question, Trump administrations angle ensuring kids back school? see couple possibilities, one these?

1. kids school parents theoretically able work thus think make economy approval ratings look better.

2. Schools inevitably outbreaks they're unable handle due forced open fed without support fed. Thus trying 'starve beast' make private schools somehow look better receive tax payer funding.

3. Something else?? work living = sociopath. Got it. Public schools part capitalist system. Nice try, though. Yeah was. nothing people like car races. would paid 45k/year decade ago Bachelors. going give back Masters, quoted $55k/year 2 years. ended online year $8k accredited non-profit online college. new job didnt rack debt! Frankly, much better interactive learning experience too, opposed traditional school basically commuted sat large class room along ton people, yet barely spoke soul there. Hi White, curious Cells cells mean immunity. link use info
 Thx Yes, good sign consistent evidence kids transmit frequently rarely get sick. course, Americans incessant doomers -- really annoying live attitude countrymen! -- and, single child gets sick, act like schools must remain closed forever. “False promises”. I’m sorry, respect, media-softened language much. They’re *lies*. Republican scum deeply evil, duplicitous liars, core. know ex-FSB dude. part ""retirement package"" gets use hospital elite. said vaccinated already, including him. that's true, kinda believe based personal knowledge fo guy, means actually faith product. make sense - really know cases vaccines, even botched lead significant number fatalities disabilities. part wealthy elite, still take chances vaccine.

Another thing - vaccine candidates report good results. Like strong immune responses, adverse effects, etc. reason one different. Even we're think Russian science garbage, intelligence undoubtely top-notch. hack elections every single country world, definitely steal shitty vaccine. Although returned Canada pandemic, I'm Kettle sunning Florida. family work US, healthcare serving Americans; many think COVID-19 joke. educated science taking every precaution disease. However, family members Canada need us, die pandemic, return. test , create cases. That’s president says. don’t understand science. 

At all. 

Which fine. can’t expected educated everything. 

But wtf debating something know don’t understand. opinion something know don’t understand? 

Please educate yourself! 6 highlights 3 minutes window enough me. I'm done today. right, much easier pay bills they're crippled dead. There's logic it. digits screen (money) good standing faceless strangers (bills) become important living? modern world really messed humans up. Awake slumber people guess 20 cases day bad.

*cough cough* murica usernames strange taste.... pretty sure person switching accounts. seem popular thing days... well, wrong, even different people. wish we're fb twitter. really need see photos reading posts. wonder got strategy? Double that, double Biggest scam running. new study analyzed data Centers Disease Control Prevention deaths related Covid-19 February 1, 2020, May 23, 2020, found 68.7% patients die Covid-19 died medical facilities, 22.7% nursing homes, 5.2% home 1.9% hospice facilities. compared 2018 deaths due causes similar time period, 35.7% deaths took place medical facilities, 19.1% nursing homes, 31.1% home, 7.9% hospice facilities.

Math? 68.7% compared 35.7% difference twelve hundred percent We're pretty damn covid thing.

It however, started us.... Surface transmission rare -- never even proven -- so, long plan sleep infected motel employee cuddling bed, fine. extra cautious, could open door room outside 10 minutes upon arrival set a/c unit pull fresh air. Really, though, hotel motel rooms safe. think risk illness slept car, get good sleep hygiene, got bad cold lack sleep. went private college got degree stage production, specifically stage lighting. way could learned everything via online. Making students pay price half learning experience absolutely criminal. 

Also, would like refund degree. It’s going long time anyone profession needed back 🙃 people give shit stay home much possible go daily virus-spreading lives. words nothing change. Enforce already ffs! get fucking GED late  God interviewer gentle Neanderthal Cruella.

Things said:

“So don’t plan.”
“No, ‘Reopen schools’ plan.”
“So happy children continue spreading virus.”
“Who telling make calls?” bring spooky countries like China Russia we've almost certainly intentional miscounts US? Catering Karens ALWAYS loses money.  Lmfao yea right. honestly think we're gonna lose many people covid Spanish flu, delusional fuck. elections must coming soon *does apply police America wonderful?  Mask mandate Sarasota isn’t enforced- many Trump/anti-maskers even told city commissioners vote gladly pay fine refuse wear masks- proves also afford fine, financially torn like rest us. isn’t one lose jobs try form one use official numbers 3,400,000 cases 140,000 deaths, that's 4% news yesterday Norway corona patients respirators. Hopefully trend continue.  Going vacation pandemic put locals serious risk &amp; totally unnecessary. Please stay home on, tourism absolutely ravaging rural state &amp; husband can't afford stay home. think tourists even think us real people they're putting risk... Fuck fuck fuck. guess every person gonna know someone that’s died something . Fuck picture everyone outdoors little info box link (lab-confirmed deaths reported patients generally (range worldwide count read it, seems generally due lack testing. see Brexit? 

Social Media disinformation every country, America. Eventually realize panic isn’t necessary. aren’t ready yet. every aspect, we're superior covid nation.  bit chubby preteen / early teen parents super controlling food. thing. probably ate junk food food-monitoring.

It turns chubbiness due PCOS, diagnosed mid-30s. Turns made feel like crap something completely control. (I eat differently thin older sister, actually much active).  even really address point. players less risk ""doing things right now"" would I'm right. 8% players already got virus outside bubble. got fired?! Getting dangerous, full stop.

We definitely need evidence reinfections also account exceptional cases false positives could make general statement (or materially reduced) immunity.

Herd immunity might put end Covid hardly way problem — means we've brought forward consequences. like idea too. people visual seeing someones full face makes everyone happy. think would acceptabled manner mask is? Fuck USA selfish bastards. Yes, one worse great. Cup coffee 50 cents? That's good deal. severe within 21st century **yet...** India's population 1.3 billion though Damn downvotes?? Seems like win-win everybody lol Interesting theory... scary interesting... *""We gonna win, win, win. We're going win military, we're going win borders, we're going win trade, we're going win everything. friends going call, going say, 'Mr. President, please, can't take anymore, can't win anymore like this, Mr. President, driving us crazy, winning much, please Mr. President, much, I'm going say I'm sorry, we're going keep winning going make America great again.""* heavy debate starting Australia Supression vs Elimination exact reason. wipe virus, keeps coming back. got many nations unlikely option. “It’s mask”

“It’s vaccine”

“It’s chip implant”

It’s slippery slope get started path giving freedom “security”. Univ Illinois top 20 nationally ranked MBA program 25k state out. 2 years top quality learning best professors country 25k. Entirely online 80% program professor driven. balance budget. 

One semester private college one semester state students colleges far lesser quality. Lot kids getting screwed right angry. Last week state New York recorded **2 days** **no deaths**. regulations suggested (masks, social distancing, etc) work...they fucking work. 

It's anti-mask wahoos ruining us. look rest civilized world, cases cascading similar regulations. Also same, still semesters took dumb classes enough decent elective options. Came lolz. I'm Pensacola probably little half people see wearing mask. It’s good thing none us said that, Cause can't buy food also die?  doubt either, people resistant hearing it. word post carefully discount idea could factor intention, though believe large country really able get fully accurate count even they're genuinely trying.  People need protest kid’s school. mean doesn’t care really best advice. credits transfer afford switch majors discover like current one. Lol holy shit can’t believe people still make posts. Wouldn’t angry mob also pass virus around?  wear mask every day part. frustrates end probably able travel internationally end next year, soon. selfishness fellow Americans enough make move countries change citizenship.

Oh wait. Can't I? Karen's allowed stats dead. Average age, weight, height, healthy, etc. Yikes, that's insane! Pretty much reason refused move L.A. wife wanted to. wanted home, never happening there. wish luck finding makes happy allows live best life. earth getting 1 1000? Disney also closed anyone told states (including Northeast) did.

Give credit due.

They also pretty solid plan preventing community spread.

I say someone who:

A) Lives Northeast fully supports policies made us safest nation aginast virus.

B) family vacation axed Disney one week left.

I trust WDW smarter opening DeSantis.  think safely, I'm willing give shot. They've proven deserve much. government even taking away free parking doctors/nurses pandemic.
Maybe clap hard enough. Actually, bad behavior expected one three things listed. However, actually talking regular person. Yes, 1 4 people meet job rude jerks treat like dirt. teacher unions leverage schools deal bullshit vote? guy beat Stacey Abrams? f**k wrong people? CNN &amp; rest cable news really journalists staff anymore. troll twitter &amp; report ""breaking news"" find there, wall pundits comment it. They're really amplifing bullshit rises top social media. Delta way, way better. Everyone aware poster defends burning cell phone towers. left bias mean supporting scientific method? pro Vox context? Normally 3% harder breathe mask read. trouble breathe mask bad mask serious health condition stay home. 

If use filter mask, change filter. minutes Cloth mask change mask (maybe wrong fabric use, maybe wet something like that). still trouble use surgical mask read best chance breathe without trouble. Still hard breathe? Seek soon possible help normal - Keep mind breathing problems sign covid. Feels reals Welp, guess ask got degrees epidemiology. Maybe tell us US gotten rising hospital numbers control since killing old people younger people fine. secret fixing max occupancy ICU problem I'd like hear it. involve turning people away couple boxes zicam? thought cold. people going ICU colds? safe sleeping car outside? know many people used motel room, well cannot trust cleaned throughroughly, maybe could look auto-hotel/motel? Depending degree also learn material relevant work may eventually end ... yea studied liberal arts sure.. purchased toilet paper. Ducey? Given police officers, think would counter productive. Hahahahahahahahaha. Provide proof please. Damn, Ted Cruz gotten fat. Surely he's high risk category. studies, got it. matter response triggers.  matters works, proven.

Many diseases disguise live body die, dormant want attacking want.

I'm saying case here. I'm saying early drop mic.  know. guy voted governor? Ahh maybe rebrand Florida Flu? Sarasota passed 60 day mask ‘mandate’ enforcement weak many exceptions basically cancel fact trying require masks ‘ social distancing possible.’ Also full yuppie anti-maskers would pay fine ‘right.’ like everywhere else- mask become political. COVID-19 positive test numbers tossed Manatee County, again, don’t want alarm wealthy idiots decided organize protest masks million dollars yachts, rain. joe rogan told nothing. Ah yes, police, known killing people... Except hockey [Homer Renaissance courts politically aligned US, results may vary... Don’t remind us. Syladebussey, one favorite composers wife's nurse maybe I'm hearing fb posts stories pr primarily, know saw reporting subject UK too. man spat nurse's face told gonna get anyway. Step 2: listen China welcome. I'd say coughs, sneezes spittle would still mostly contained cloth. Ionized liquid really act way gas go valve. Like sneezing elbow, air escapes sneeze contained. might less efficiency. sure much. think positive news, I'm curious see others think. I've calling shot somehow Trump force early release. I'm sure power strong arm company it, I'm sure he'll give try. 
I also sure people even get sore throat. referencing stage 1 trials, monkey got infected virus vaccination pumped 100x normal level virus directly monkeys lungs, monkey cough that. 20s 30s skills education, absolutely best time emigrate US.

If older, going need million bucks bank unless status.

For example, direct descendant Germans stripped citizenship Nazis, apply German citizenship. would exactly? much much much likely die car wreck killed via murder, form, combined large exponential factor, know what's heavily engineered incredibly safe laws regulations? sure hell isnt surveillance murder. first kid child dies needlessly sitting desk... thought breaks heart. sad. imagine class 8 year olds told teacher love dead. suppose, really bad, could try route.

So current handling pandemic ""really bad""? Unless people willing recall impeachment, means politicians badly. HIV literally officially designated pandemic. one seems issue throwing Black Death comparisons despite flea-borne illness. Liars em biological attack country, conducted 5th column. Thanks 😁 parents also infiltrated Karens. stubborn stupid prasident people don’t value lives even. People REALLY resistant seeing HIV severe pandemic despite unimaginable death suffering caused. wonder feel removed it--it mostly used kill gay men, mostly kills people Africa, *obviously* bad thing affects loved ones right here. Maybe sexual element transmission allows people add moralistic level, even subconsciously thinking sufferers ""deserved it"" level.

690,000 people died 2019, mid-level estimate. Yet think something that's gone. voted suggesting overtaking swine flu make covid current 21st century pandemic frontrunner even though absolutely correct. that's sad. excuse take covid less seriously all--on contrary, perhaps covid could make us take global impact HIV *more* seriously. half million lives lost covid far disaster. Imagine happening EVERY YEAR, years without end. link?  doable. actually banning who?

Are supposed believe US reason ban Canadians? Covid lockdowns seem work eradicate it. Politicians subscribe end it. solutions politicians eradicate things listed? South Wales open borders small spot fires need put out.

NSW looks like precipice second wave sadly. there’s idea.... is, point chance, blew it. sons didn’t retweet conspiracy theories, came support Fauci beginning, wore masks, could much different position are. ""You cannot reason someone position reason into.""  ? Certainly deaths. agree, feel lose lives, also shake head idiots fucked Could explain more? don’t get haven’t prioritized yet. can’t least get ball rolling this? Isn’t illegal United States? Sending politicians jail? would guess since SARS insurance policies country would clause policy payout death caused virus declared global pandemic. meant I've deleted moronic post favor keeping non-scientists dark.

Because best antidote laypeople struggling difficult issues accuse making shit up, citing qualifications assert superiority, pick tiny technicality that's relevant question hand, way provide constructive response original question.

TIL. military adores Alaska proximity so, sure would happen. Canada polite anyways. dont want get mixed US bullshit sure. Yeah deaths decling T-cell immunity... Agreed. 2 little ones, school session, sick time. can’t even imagine teachers. Economic experts said since beginning short harsh lockdown better economy half-assed lockdown keeps flipping back forth, even care lives all. think current situation proves correct, unfortunately, leadership seem short-sighted bad listening economic experts listening health experts. find problem, two ways acting:

1. start thinking solution, work solve it. done this, find culprit make pay case.

2. American, make political issue, ignore possible way solve situation, ignore raising numbers, make humanitarian catastrophe become epicenter world. meanwhile, blame anyone things got hand keep helping grow becomes well... now. MAGA cult. 

That's it. Next.   Jesus. baby made recovery way, still, that's scary surprising anybody? viruses transmitted mother child stage. seems like everyone made optimistic assumption possible virus (i.e. droplet only, spread kids, etc) based plans assumptions. That's really stupid. understand day person died, one articles Friday Saturday Yeah, I'm boat. think means travel like used to. think time things bad enough anyone who's ever going take seriously circumstances fast approaching. need lose little ground gained see things get real, real shitty. Jesus Christ! dangerous extra testing??? God, anybody there, life, universe, whoever there....help us. way much misery. get rid crap state wants shut open different schedules??
The whole U.S. needs shut quarantine period time go there.
Thought ""United"" States... did, lot people want believe them.  Thanks Donald. Pos terrifying South's numbers including deaths days weeks old. Saying nothing infection occurred. wait... TIL
Thanks! dangerous,vaccines created within weeks spanish flu sure didnt work people couldt see viruses time dangerous!
Vaccines safe issue work not.

also pro vax!
I studied biology never seen anything dangerous vaccines “Less 1% infected die.”

“So?! 1% didn’t expect them!”

That’s statistics mean nothing hypo lmao. say cloth masks offer protection absolutely zero evidence back up. However provided evidence contrary also disprove point. Unless plan trying discredit University Oxford too?


From link provided RCTs heterogeneous across community settings ranging Hajj pilgrims, university households settings. pooled meta-analysis, authors conclude significant reduction influenza transmission use face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51-1.20, p=0.25).

Lol Yup, &amp; don’t forget ‘relaxation station’ areas guests take masks off! HIV doesn’t spread air. need fuck you, share needles order get it. There’s remarkable difference quickly spiral control. Hope Xi sees bro. push Orange County ocean? better yet LA SD counties eat OC? split it. least governed sane people crazies might calm bit stop running amok goddamn much nothing US? Nascar great motif introduce scene occurs near race track. Yes bad news - two chances push north again. Right heat waves spread across country, September/October weather cools schools go back. guaranteed high rates infection New Year. hope Lockdown 2.0 change administration. Guy man hate Online classes bullshit show college isn’t learning all. Distribution administration know manufacturing vaccines something speak confidence. Currently US, manufacturing vaccines running flat out. call sort manufacturing ""at risk"" means product get license, trash. could upwards hundred million doses combined vaccines US year's end.

Not enough vaccine everyone day one get there. BARDA spending tax dollars support buy products us. Even rest federal government bunch buffoons. ""deep state"" quietly working save asses.

I'm much interested force people take it. taken severe measures past vaccines, wonder things again. would fully support barring unvaccinated kids public schools, business barring unvaccinated adults working public events checking vax papers door. alas, worry America weak place let worst us win again. Even regular flu joke. That’s problem anecdotal stories, level infection you’re bound hear extremely bad. recently worked flu OTC product heard stories parents lost child flu, horrifying. people say “it’s really bad flu” they’re entirely wrong even though use trivialize COVID. it’s flu worse patterns, issue don’t realize bad flu already - flu cold. We’ve accepted reality, it’s normal, comes back every year, yet kills hundreds thousands really bad you. really bad flu unfortunately terrible disease. Yeah they’ve already caught fudging numbers. Don’t buy death toll bullshit. Trump's same. People begging part electorate tends skew older, less educated, less shape, unhealthy, risk dying this, simply wear mask keep us getting it.

When refuse, get sick, eventually die, really hard feel sympathy them, they're still humans, still sad see happen. Plus ones refuse wear masks making things dangerous us trying keep us healthy.

At point, wonder way get Darwinism take effect.

These people betting followers last long enough pull lever November. that, they'll figure strategy. HIV doesn’t spread air. need fuck you, share needles order get it. wondered person too. know knows now, small town party, bar rally... KILLED HIM. US still reviewing works work countries. Americans made mind masks help, even though countless countries shown measures effective.

And constant blaming others. cares says average Joe can't take responsibility lazy social distancing? says say means nothing average american give shit follows whatever hype popular. honest forget higher chances child abuse mentioned. also expose shitty childcare US, school shouldn’t treated daycare teachers aren’t even paid well. daycare options Americans wouldn’t issue would think. think still deciding Toronto, Buffalo, Dunedin/St. Petersburg. That’s US. Estimated global cases 700 million 1.4 billion. Wrong. inwas right masks...and blood type.... I'm right also.

You say I'm using preliminary data instead 5 double blind peer reviewed studies... can't say happened (because has,).

During pandemic work think feet, sadly people incapable ruin joke. really giving Don-Don run ""Shit Head Year"". 💩4🧠z know problem is? **Obviously it’s drone!!** 😂 You’re completely misunderstanding... basically everything. 

The deaths current pandemic caused much problems outbreaks places. 

The swine flu truly went global. global death toll spread across world. 

If spread hospital death rates pandemic across world, average person would never notice it. study France/Spain show results? didn’t fucking say anything though Where? someone worked university going attending grad school fall university charging full $50k tuition: 

1: understand universities coming it’s like operating costs changed. think cost students expected pay scam disagree big paychecks university execs get. also think commodifying education pushed universities invest campus amenities still cost money maintain. still doesn’t change universities still pay professors, support staff maintain pay buildings even one use them. 

2: don’t mind online learning alternative would taking public transportation everyday get class sitting classroom bunch people may may social distancing/wearing masks free time think terribly unsafe. don’t want get sick. I’m also confident program I’m going effectively taught online. thing feel concerned missed networking opportunities, plan applying internships, etc hopefully make it. 

3: chose school gave lot financial aid. primary costs living expenses. opinion still remains isn’t sound financial decision go $50k/yr university pay full tuition unless rich parents trust fund cover that. US surpassed Brazil  'MURICA! Mask mandates preclude tourism shut movement, fact make tourism **much** safer, towns open tourists without taking big risk they'll outbreak cripples tiny health infrastructure. CDPHE tweeted [this - red areas mandatory mask ordinances place. That's lot blank space, including county, rely heavily tourism. mountain-town-heavy counties done it, pointing reason can't statewide make much sense me. 

In weird way, think fact mask ordinance difficult enforce good argument it. level people know symbolic gesture, important. messaging coming Polis right strong, simultaneously weak, he's willing put consequences behind lack mask use. mandating masks statewide, cripples efforts local governments businesses get mask use higher proportion communities, opposition face point governor. would take political hit (I understand hit purple state), empowers leaders Republican counties/districts say ""sorry, gotta do"" fear *their* political fallout much. We're letting fear elected permeate levels leadership right now, thereby letting unnecessary politicization mask use dictate society. exaggeration? part? Yeah Russian lizard Agents paid chinese Government cyborg pretend bill gates implant microchip author control via 5g. control flat Earth harvest Adrenochrome babys Pizza connection... /s Sports general intelligence test. People like visceral thrill witnessing competition. get thrill possess higher abstract reasoning ability, can't watch sports without realizing none matters. spectacle every year resets try again. 

In life I've hyped one two times became fan local team moderately well thrill thinking could win. didn't, reset, thing, stopped caring. 

I could see attention span lasts lap two could get excited one two position changes. Like, meaningful excitement feels good enough return more. people value lives people disagree with. Shut up, Karen H1N1 bad? remember thousands infected it. probably meant keep antibodies every single antigen ever encountered circulating. paid opportunity get degree. state you’d literally go straight dictator shut everything people simply taking anything seriously. They’re still partying, wearing masks, maintaining distance 6 ft, etc. Americans selfish, regardless race political affiliation  One Redditor Canada make. Agreed case want know (EU):

Get grip.  0.26% death rate. say ""There evidence lung damage permanent, follow imaging showed good recovery even severe cases,"" study cite severe cases nonetheless well enough discharged hospital.

I'm point making decision, near future unpredictable. might elect new president transition back sense stability. may decend civil war. latter, uprooting family becoming Canadian seems like logical choice option. Man, I've flown American almost exclusively whole adult life. miles saved up, going use go somewhere fun pandemic hit.

Now, seeing kind behavior airline, doubt I'll flying American anymore. Usually critics Europeans Americans. Maybe less arrogant dickhead Americans see 😂

I'm kidding true surprised America would much problem virus. hope manage stay safe It’s pretty early, no? It’s week. He’s got lot time get aneurysm. worst human being. Asymptomatic people like main spreaders COVID-19 likely contributed easily preventable deaths. “There's two things hate world. People intolerant people's cultures Dutch.” Haha convince, ty I'm flattered. Yes juat acknowlwdged teuth makes ignorant. balancing ignorance deniabilty.may china business vhina fact matter stays. Tom Hanks got look Indeed. Deaths UK likely nearer 65k 45k fact. They're suppressing cases testing community too. die without test may counted. point start physically removing people. I’ve noticing states combating virus longer high new case death ratio. example yesterday NY 665 new cases 42 deaths (NJ 451/30). Whereas relative newcomer states like Florida Texas ratios like 12624/35 9156/80. There’s probably lot factors going death rate dropping imagine new comer states going reporting deaths months cases added right now. death rate going climb even manage get new cases down. idiot highly functioning sociopath? $$$

I’m pissed even conversation elected officials having.

Let’s close schools 200k cases open 3M cases. Fucking STONKS close 1k deaths per day since May, I'm still sure fact would matter. Always appreciate snark professional redditor though. would prefer rode bridge knocked horse. made sign waiver upon entering place believe hoax therefore don’t need treatment contract it.... Stupid Normally, sympathize argument long term systemic issues, even disagree main premise. Issue is, put kids coworkers situation could easily die quickly, there's literally nothing lose. Nothing. Teaching certificates income literally matter anymore actions could result short term death, deaths coworkers students teachers swear protect topic automobile thousands deaths, related lack seat belts worn, administration publicly stating seat belts good ""I wear them"", complete lack speed limit laws regulating safety automobiles. think done?

Cars go fast. need get places - people dying, hurry. Studies show speed limits seat belts save lives. support either options?

Cars go fast. Slowing fast. Safety handled case case saying areas dangerous others different approach safety? plan address automobile accidents? 

Accidents happen. approach driving flexible. Cars go fast. NHTSA clearly shows driving fast main contributor automobile accidents. follow NHTSA guidelines approach driving fast? 

The NHTSA never said slow down. guidelines flexible. Cars need go fast. end world already :( Still many infections really traced protesting masks No, didn’t call Gen Z kids neo-boomers yet.

I hope helps. really like argument, thank you.

But they've said normal 80 year olds die colds, they're saying part old age

Because I'm highest earning family love throwing fact saying I'm talking ivory tower... :/  Work TN confirm. boss got back two weeks FL. Pretty sure heard -all- coworkers talking vacation plans... take online assessment allowed work, temps checked, wearing masks gloves, talking vacation like random work specific change policy akin dress code something. selfish shortsighted suffice say yes, TN people set FL SC vacations, pandemic damned.

ps work department store. also mention several stores around, mask-mandated areas, -none- workers masks. Even grocery stores. stay safe people. fact *Texas Medical Center* filling people still act though normal blows fucking mind. 1. thing since March.
2. doesn’t, 3M+ confirmed cases probably many millions unconfirmed. go work. limit trips store. grocery store many people, go another one. hand sanitizer truck. wear mask. I've working house cars home. last part unchanged me. Since many things closed, I've lot biking. would risk simply time spare. people recovered without realizing. 0.004% death rate iirc. ""
""Although hope regarding cellular immunity (including T-cell responses) absence durable antibody response, early evidence reinfections puts effectiveness immune responses question reddit require hard double blind peer reviewed data thing disagree opinions promoting others untested."" TIL man actual place called “Murica” isn’t America 😂 think main problem contract covid meantime still infected seasonal influenza virus. covid alone 1% mortality rate, another infection going really make immune system crazy things completely deplete body. I'm trying say think like 1%+0,2%... Basic emoji reading skills guess. sorely lack emoji reading skills idea face ment. irrelevance. swine flu figures multi year totals. 8k people died 2009. really flu. 😂 🙄 🙄 might well robot repeatedly saying sentence. Can’t answer simple question. like answer honestly ground would open take them. don’t get look mirror.To say Dayton Florida everyday thousands Corina virus positive results 4,000 deaths already... Cut oxygen 130,000 deaths countries told seeing huge declines since month ago, would suddenly get faster stop point increased death toll nearly 500x?
Edit: realised made mistake using us death toll worldwide, still leaves us around 1% Spanish flu death toll.  URSS, current Russia. could argue resources centralization remains communist days, don’t know. Seems sketchy. expect deaths spike? We've seen massive increase cases comparatively low increase deaths. I’m sure professors exist I’ve never one. also think online learning bullshit. ""Although hope regarding cellular immunity (including T-cell responses) absence durable antibody response, early evidence reinfections puts effectiveness immune responses question reddit require hard double blind peer reviewed data thing disagree opinions promoting others untested. Well shit captain obvious. opening labs college campuses? issue back March, FDA certified labs process tests - well need call best bud open shit process faster.

How prioritizing test results? NBA test players every couple days get results 24 hours - can't average person? prioritize RESIDENTS state first. RIP Texas. Well main one find traces system weeks months. buddy works naviant indiana. facilities skw5leton crews right now, outbreak one them. refusing close building, saying best job.

They also apparently play fox news tvs break room day Cuomo asking trump March DPA activation. [pushes glasses up], Umm, that's EXECUTE ORDER 66! Sucks CO border TX.

Apparently mountains summer. Gotta weird communities, there's desperately needed tourism money ski season cut short, they'll also almost definitely get coronavirus communities. many homeschool kids.

Unfortunately group pretty ignorant, often anti-vaxxers, even set play groups show things like measles coronavirus secular hoaxes... Even bigger: Deaths caused meteor 65mil years ago, coming belt! Idaho, fucking idiots. defended yesterday. problem Trump can’t order National shutdown/quarantine. do/should highly suggest parents ever considered ""not living Florida""?  Minnesota opening nursing homes family members now. BIG mistake. lost job ALF, got building, never left, spread like wildfire. Everyone get exposed doubt. would 100% trust Chinese vaccine due long history experience SARS. Chinese government isn’t even currently claiming vaccine option next months. fail see Russia suddenly resources knowledge beyond create vaccine faster. anything, tells Putin willingly play vaccine politics endangering country’s population a, ahem, Russia Roulette approach vaccination.


I personally kind worried 100% vaccine Mexico get cheapest, fastest one. president already talks Putin therapeutics, sure push hard vaccine standard here. Ugh. People vanish, die homes pneumonia heart attacks. die care homes make record while. comment pointed out, even prosperous nations undercounting least 30%. intentional, hard thing count. places may ALSO intentional (China, Russia). 

If government says 300, 500, 1000 people died covid today, know family member list? suspect million overstating it, 800k absolutely would expect accurate number. SHOCKED million.

Remember, death count swine flu pandemic subject thread massive range 151,700–575,400, CONFIRMED toll 18k. numbers far precise. got nothing culture, lack social responsibility quality education... drone!


Murikans never fail meet standards. protests""

French government giving protests again, wonder around 4-5 times unemployment western nation.

The decision doubly shocking consider fact France carried *fewest tests per capita entire developed world least factor two*  Orgy! actually thing Disney financial trouble. well diversified. shaping way. insane. Best thing people get tip top shape give bodies best chance fight invasion. Vitamins a,c,d,k zinc. I've waiting see studies effects healthy vs healthy. skinny healthy. could require masks give verbal warnings days. doubt country started issuing widescale fines first day masks required.

And good luck guys. Seriously. New York City, city biggest protests, hasn’t seen crazy uptick cases like Florida California. fact, continue reopen. Unless think sort magical vaccine here, protests really increase transmissions rates. might standing sue American airlines enforcing mask policy. Except course USA coronavirus real. real everywhere else world Americans badass virus stand chance.

/s first LOL day - thanks. (-: punishable death penalty Floridian thought hope one day wealthy corrupt ‘alter’ vote favor candidate- case Ron barely eeked win Governor. live constant exhaustion anxiety knowing Florida much control election- ‘conveniently’ ( Trump’s favor) disorganized chaos Florida votes likely major deciding factor election. Jeez really let go that's worst angle ever. heroes wear masks... I’ve heard, Disney limited total guest numbers much don’t know they’re even profiting. thought they’d cancel reopening now, though. NBA might able make work. NHL pretty god chance, think, given thing NBA, Canada rather Florida.

I idea MLB thinks pull teams traveling cities. That's nuts. That's right way go it, instead reopening cancelling preventive measures whenever infection rates deemed ""acceptable"".  So... Let people get infected infect millions reasonable family/friends, everyone learn lesson, might anyway considering people get virus survive, killing 100s 1000s instead. Great idea! one Canadians mail mr big tho? Agree.  vaccine fantasy. Nothing like horizon 2022 best. We're going live this. Pointless shut now; shutting meant authorities shape use precious time gained implement effective measures combat virus reopening later. see, that’s gonna happen, might well “live it” lol... think things already:

1. less virus air
2. pack everyone AC'ed rooms
3. plan know doing.  also titles effectively saying ""human-to-human transmission Covid ***might*** possible."" 

People report conclusions based specific, plausible assumptions within study's boundaries, degree fidelity credibility conclusions based nothing journalist introducing massive unfounded assumptions nothing study. saw that. Absolutely reprehensible. Transparency? We’re here. Yes, many students used someone teaching. suppose, it’s less 40 week yeah probably helps 'Might' leaves open possibilities. mean, trump isn’t saying whoopsie. requires taking fraction responsibility. numbers won’t known years. mean, trump isn’t saying whoopsie. requires taking fraction responsibility.  panicking, death rate rarely brought days, nothing celebrate. Romania, country population Florida less half many Covid related deaths. know sounds simplistic, demonstrate understand values, convince least protestors wear masks. that, need really work hard, things say sound silly. need get underneath rationales see really driving behavior. Here's youtube video analysis behind one silly sounding non-mask wearer.

 I'm sorry. forgot Covid-19 can't survive within US' borders thus making comparisons US' UK's precautions irrelevant.  Guys chill. Reptiles can’t catch spread COVID-19 He's either reading impaired intentionally picked something knew correct maybe worded slightly wrong shit you, nice guy. Yup, reason bought better mask... Good luck. I'll balcony contemplating bonsai trees. less virus deadly, America fucking stupid. short: Americans fat unhealthy please tell legal protection have? Oh dear can't, add countries back selectively removed statement becomes false. matter though topic going bye bye since breaks sub rules. think whack-a-mole approach going norm large densely populated countries vaccine emerges. Smaller countries really dense urban areas might able eliminate, England/Spain/France/Italy going struggle.

England, example, four cities populations big Wales. I'm suddenly curious whether deaths tend go years event like many people who'd naturally died next years carried within shorter span time one disease. maybe it'll offset increased death toll survivors covid chronic organ damage. guess we'll find out. 😕 apologize. would like smack upside head things sometimes he'd probably hit back natural reaction would accidently way damage would him. feel little hope said he'd never go store required mask has. Also, big city thstsbless 5 minutes mandated masks I'm hoping little town follows suit. 

Now js inappropriate say, I'm glad America place sunglasses. opinions country operate, I, everybody else. make tyrannical oppressive, expressing free speech. Oh sorry, understand. Something like r/worldnews virus. r/covid19 might step direction. need another economic impact payment fast! According IRS, I'm going receive first one 4-6 months. 

File taxes tomorrow, people! changed 2009/2010 2020 US.

I believe multi decadal anti-intellectualist movement going US. Evident everything media military. combat idea, become rampant like monster. Give kids free gigabit internet they'll play games day. taking precautions since January. new york seeing 30% population antibodies like 2 months ago? focus conversation? terms %age pop right What's reference mention Trump, dumbass. Man wish they'd start specifying Orange County titles. live Orange County central Florida get memed lot thinking us r/nationalteacherstrike Good you, keep kids safe. Yes. think we'll see shift towards health. Similar happened 9/11 massive funding spent terrorism.  cold gets sick 6 months shouldn’t going anyways, you’re hardly hindered anti maskers. oh god gonna die growing trend people refusing wear masks US? family members also falling suit, including father purposely going without mask break rules get confrontations. I'm originally US currently living Germany, things relatively back normal followed guidance wearing mask. 

I'm getting can't understand reluctance wear mask can't practice social distancing. fairness, people equally distributed across province. nowhere near Hong Kong, got quite bit density Winnipeg middle nowhere north province. Please give us hope. tourism industry Common sense actually common back does, prompt effective response contain virus important. Countries took effective measures early able move US floundering getting worse every day. paying long term poverty job loss afraid short term poverty job loss. NY followed European way - full shutdown majority New Yorkers behaved like adults. daily new cases, active cases, daily new deaths. New York HUGE protests. even blip. pretty consistent states opened responsibly way New York did. Nobody saying protests *nothing* transmission, data says effect negligible. Again, facts feelings.

Whatever media you’re consuming manipulating you. anyone good idea safe flying right now? Even masks distancing still seems sort risky many people encounter airport. ok fly right avoided? I'm fan war idea, global pandemic. America keeps going way is, odds increase significantly.  

Think trophy widows over! Tons old dudes gonna bite dust sometimes forgot prenup! Shoot shot buddy! importantly parents work time projects. Online schooling basically outsourcing teachers job parents. that's route we're going teachers laid off.  White House doesn’t credibility itself. aborhent human Yup thats logic talking. bravo.
I didnt know hatred trump trumps logical reasoning. many children get sick close schools?  Ahh understand. Damn 19th century cancel culture. wonder mom butt many jokes. talking about?  Brazil's hospitals overflowing yet?  thought week 2 ago everyone said full things get crazy? likely trolling absolutely idea talking comes French politics reply strikes part since think replying tests based (I'd guess) worldometers infos state (once again) numbers plain false. 1.4m number tests paid attention move since months never updated.

We total free easy access tests France queue every labs Paris get tested updated worldometers . (just example, know people got somes issues) got tested got results less 12 hours. (both pcr blood test)

I'm saying French response number tests done perfect (I'm quite opposite side lost co-worker covid) test numbers see often based false information.

Edit :

I edit message realised actually updated numbers yesterday 2.4M tests, seems enough include data specified [this official data report ""Santé public fichier mis à disposition contient uniquement les tests réalisés par les laboratoires de ville. Il ne recense pas l’ensemble des tests réalisés en France.

Actually, like crows, proper plural ‘a murder’. top guy said, forget orange fans seem insistent upon killing moment! maybe shift things little bit Another prof here, I’ve seen finances behind scenes unis don’t much choice. Though students think tuition paying on-campus experience, truth 90% budget goes salaries salaries locked job contracts. #students enrolled, drop enrollment dramatic even firing large % staff partial furloughs remainder, universities still going ~$100-200 million red year. everybody already cut/furloughed much possible (as much possible w/o crippling ability teach), there’s basically way offer classes *at all* w/o full tuition *partially* pay remaining profs (who cases already hit w partial furloughs). 

For lot schools choice is, either ask full tuition declare bankruptcy right now. state schools, that’s often possible unless state declares bankruptcy, law state unis stumble somehow, asking full tuition bad experience one side, firing/furloughing employees hand, *still* able balance budget. make sense numbers need know normal year, even random 5% drop enrollment given year financial crisis. It’s always house cards freakishly dependent # students enroll. lot schools going shut. Maybe it’s time.

The last I've heard anything Dr. Fauci's claim yet happened [as week documented cases people got better actually got sick sense virus replicating,” said. “I wouldn’t surprised there’s rare case individual went remission relapsed. ... But Francis, say confidence, unlikely it’s common phenomenon.”

Aside person article, also woman Dallas weeks back returned hospital felt sick again, never follow story confirming it. South Korea also said cases thought reinfections actually not. That's ask. seems bit incomplete information there.  Perhaps.

It would interesting sit outside store tally ages, genders, etc.of mask. Possibly ask WTF? listen. Pfizer timeline now, well seems like mixed bag. NYTimes article touching this. 
  
 colleague Knvul Sheikh wrote use face shields, easily wiped reused. Face shields also benefit stopping people touching faces, easier comfortable However, experts say face shields limits amount protection offer. seem effective protecting cough droplets people close range one another. droplets seep back sides face shield, draping piece cloth along bottom recommended. efficacy yet widely studied. now, face masks better option people.
 
I agree mask preferable. would rather see unmasked people wear shields nothing. I've lost half lung capacity fibrosis breathe fine mask. probably due fact I'm weeny. claimed weren’t filling middle seat middle seat.

In order survive, virus could become contagious less deadly.... eventually becoming one common colds....

There lots things might happen.  think early say. 

Lots cases show either reinfection dormant behavior. (I think unlikely, could faulty testing...)

Either way, stage mostly presumptive data. view, that's one thing stressed most. Oh well guy internet told wanted hear.

So, go ahead follow CDC guidelines makes feel better, Reddit stranger. makes anyone feel better, strongly advocate someone following long within guidelines it’s safe. sharing personal anecdote.

Guidelines merely that... guidelines. rules treatment. Nobody report Honestly would rather listen salesforce.com guy Gates foundation. 

Not fan mass sterilizations vaccinations. would need mortality rate children 18. It’s almost certainly higher 18-25 group. would shocked hundreds children died total course entire pandemic. Almost ""headlines"" keep seeing forum ""Captain obvious"" headlines lol oh want going back ""old normal"" soon? Geez thought sure end August everything would normal again. 

Fauci says ""we situation US didnt lock down"" again, that's another captain obvious headline. course everything closed everybody stayed home virus spread started random population testing back April/May. would go city (NYC) go random store shops test people. (I live here) Well right. High touch points (the rides, queue rails..), kids following social distancing due age, people willing go sick waited long/spent money/don’t want disappoint kids, young people attend likely asymptomatic spreaders, extensive indoor areas....

You’re also going interact far far people usual day people. dramatically increases chance exposure inability contact trace (not problem Florida complete breakdown contact tracing). Oh yeah absolutely, I’m undermining that: salaries low-ish scale compared to, say, US, much that’s taken care (schools, even higher education, health, retirement, unemployment, elderly care, housing benefits...)

Also yeah, 70% health related acts covered social security, gets 100% many cases; also mandatory private insurance provided company, rarely anything taken pocket comes health. Oooooh thanks explaining. share yuge, best numbers seen lately, best, tremendous really. dumped stock did. Guess need investigated too.

What talking about? like happening one city continent, spread throughout continents. Pretty intelligent. Good critical thought sure. went fiancee knew really wanted go. pushed going absolute blast. 
Really fun place. I'd happily go back again. many children died far? 1,400? it’s not, 14,000 total seems impossible reach, even kids became infected (since 10% population already). I'm Newfie too, Mount Pearl, sure live nobody around wearing masks, never even really...I've seen MAYBE 1 every 1000 people wear mask

doesn't change things, still extremely safe everything else said true, felt needed clarify people ""mostly wearing masks"" put I've noticed lately subject. coordinated push discredit possibilty re-infection. thought want proceed caution? want throw caution wind, whats point masks? true.

Wake up. I‘m German. following rules bad?

Jesus that’s 0.02% population!!! ever seen 28 days later? Contagion! planet apes? We’re headed towards that! OMG! WTF gonna do?!? AAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!! NOOOOO!!! Oh humanity!!! Oh wearing masks. problem, say something find evidence says real efficacy masks community settings, people assume anti-masker. No, things harm, over-estimating effectiveness, refusing wear one. wearing masks realistic efficacy. best way. real harm assuming effective are. lead people using substitute effective measures like social distancing. see happening real world.

And yes, countries got control masks US. also got control far less mask wearing well. Canada, Finland, Denmark, Norway, example. don’t see thing makes breaks country’s response.

My hunch really matters use masks. read Denmark’s official literature this, really caution community using UNLESS practical follow proper mask protocol, lot protocol. can’t, still can’t avoid close contact, recommend shields instead. much less nuanced message masks basically cloth face, good, not, murderer. don’t feel right approach. Denmark’s nuanced mask message really worked. Mask usage stayed pretty steady 2-3 percent crushed virus. Yep! add that! High temps average around 60 July, nobody’s running AC indoors. There's 1-2 week delay reporting deaths, 2-3 weeks takes confirmation death. Gov Texas said expect reported deaths rise week, current deaths transmitted late May. Refrigerated trucks already seen outside Texas hospitals indicating overload morgues.

I wish could share optimism.  understand trumpy bear wants win election don’t understand killing teachers kids helps point... ironically thing could help would extreme stay home mask ordinances get control.

New York one states count deaths someone infected long-term care facility transferred hospital died. 

The state's death rate long-term care facilities under-reported, likely large margin.

Per state Health Department counts residents physically died within nursing home, omits contracted virus went die hospital facility. Would work Canada...


We talk opportunity, allow them... Unpopular opinion: 90% paying degree, 90% learn us curriculum. Yeah, gonna bad time went college frats parties, comes education still getting 99% paid for.

I think people angry they're missing ""the frats parties"". Rather, they're angry they're smart enough see middle-class job market died probably (barring revolution) never come back.

Our society cruel thing expects smartest 35–50% people spend 4 years loads money get leadership education, even though 1% (if that) actually get job uses it.

What's use studying machine learning going working Jira tickets? students think colleges hemorrhaging money this? overhead traditional education need invest ton new infrastructure, equipment training.

Initially, glad live alone since gets rid lot complications I'm bored lonely punished alongside people fucking stupid wear mask. you’re mistaken. 

My family Texas. One mom’s schoolteacher friends posted comment Facebook saying fearful returning work. absolutely torn apart. “Go back work!!” “It’s flu!” “I bet voted Hillary!” “If don’t like it, quit!” “Don’t baby!” “My kids gotta get back classroom!” guess everyone wore masks would work.

Yes. That's point. well established masks better job preventing asymptomatic presymptomatic people infecting others, rather protecting wearer. Nothing like blaming administration calling unfair position choice (which zero tangible value, hence need grants) getting shafted. 

Good luck dude, going go anything environmental better make sure engineering dual major, make sure second major something real. Good retail associates try enforce rules retail managers take knees trying appease customer won’t write shitty email company.

I doubt that’ll ever change. current pandemic severe within 21st century**

Yeah, forget we're \~ 20 years 21st century. Far worse stuff still come. I'm teacher, care policies day, I'm going ask kids wear masks. parent complains it, it. advocate safety, I'm going roll that. guess cdc idea it’s talking *should* do. pandemic, State Texas get replacements fast enough, even non-union state. However, Americans would refuse support them. Simply put, Americans incredibly anti-education collectively give single hoot teachers' lives. see latter cheap, expendable babysitters. Hence states like Florida, Texas, New York, Arizona, Colorado opening fall. 1% needs worker bees work, need teachers ready daycare. it’s complicated states working together. biggest barrier insurance. Lots insurance companies don’t pay treatment outside state. Medicaid state specific, almost never pays outside state receive in. Hospitals aren’t going take patients aren’t going get paid. example, work biggest employer state. count spouses children, covers 300,000 people. works 1 10 hospitals state, provides coverage 30%, deductibles co-pay. doesn’t count out-of-pocket max, bills unlimited. start moving people state, thousands people staring bankruptcy get hospital. Insurance already screaming virus horrible bottom line, aren’t going waive out-of-network coverage cover millions hospital bills legally don’t pay. true schools all. university, athletics department bring lot students supports narrative supporting school largely funded tuition, endowments. universities, endowments given sports. say get rid sports completely would mean give millions dollars endowments. Getting rid unnecessary administrative positions would make sense long haul. Thank White providing magazine material, interesting read. comment one study commented findings. second hand thoughts. One reasons good measure gives idea many new cases (probably asymptomatic) missing. Back % positive 50%, pretty clear NY missing tens thousands cases. Yup, keyword children. want know many people school aged children, many attending public schools. people I've seen arguing fiercely reopening schools either kids means either homeschool supervised remote learning without worrying working. Working parents rely public schools childcare much cautious, know they're ones actually risk stupid system. It’s difficult quantify.

I absolutely buy children less likely become seriously sick subsequently shedding fewer viral particles. paper, makes “less infectious”.

But factor children, especially young children, like touch everything, don’t wash hands properly, might fidget get uncomfortable masks, likely eat hands, whole host behavior, it’s different story. 

If I’m store kid wearing mask, I’d believe pose serious threat infection. babysit kid going school... That’s reality. Probably fewer super spreader events children every child may expose parents grand parents it. people may go spread further. “Look Idahotspot now” napoleon pedro must hell rager  That’s US. It’s estimated around 25% world’s population infected. arizona, texas, florida already rationing remdesivir  Sadly blue collar jobs best paid jobs part now...which gigantic joke. bad. difference culture people realize there. Like talking tube England, respecting queue etc. stores go St. John's 80% wearing masks, live near downtown might different population. 

I've heard many people say wearing masks. soon kicks hope they'll put on.  Underrated comment. already going up. link shows death rate case rate shifted 19 days (the average time takes testing death, end dying). Oh, correct. Despite high numbers, even remember H1N1 well anymore. be- bro wouldn’t surprised eye terror opened Big E reveals himself.

Coronavirus death poll official individually known real death pandemic

No way hell believe COVID-19 bad Spanish Flu numbers less far apart think. 

Living India, doubts actual death count would already higher US' official count poor people can't go hospitals let alone record deaths lot counted reasons absolutely can, courts ruled numerous times already. boomer sentiment. overwhelming majority canadians (regardless age) want border stay closed obvious reason.  Confirmed deaths 576,432, states. good checklist baby. actually sex pregnant man virus. wearing masks mandated county catch droplets.

A History State Authority Restrict Travel
COVID-19 first pandemic affecting America, last. circumstances, states well-recognized authority limit travel within across borders.
Over 100 years ago, smallpox era, U.S. Supreme Court issued two decisions limiting “right” interstate travel—which, way, appear U.S. Constitution. First, 1902’s Compagnie Francaise de Navigation Vapeur v. Board Health State Louisiana, Court stated:

That early day power states enact enforce quarantine laws safety protection health inhabitants recognized Congress, beyond question. Congress exercised power subject, state quarantine laws state laws purpose preventing, eradicating, controlling spread contagious infectious diseases, repugnant Constitution United States, although operation affects interstate foreign commerce, open question.

In words, Congress (not president, cannot enact law himself) says otherwise, states may act protect citizens pandemic harms.
Likewise, 1905, in Jacobson v. Massachusetts the Supreme Court held:

Upon principle self-defense, paramount necessity, community right protect epidemic disease threatens safety members … every well-ordered society charged duty conserving safety members rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand.

Although Jacobson involved vaccinations smallpox, Court’s confirmation state enact compulsory laws regulations protect residents epidemic still good law.
Good law recently applied travel case 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote Supreme Court in Zemel v. Rusk:

The right travel within United States course also constitutionally protected … freedom mean areas ravaged flood, fire pestilence cannot quarantined demonstrated unlimited travel area would directly materially interfere safety welfare area Nation whole.

By time decision, notion restrictions interstate travel warranted circumstances secure Warren could use basis analogy international travel.
Federal Inaction Interstate Travel
Thus, following Court decisions, must ask: Congress said ability restrict interstate movement time public health threats, limit states’ authority? answer Congress, past, has delegated power to Secretary Health Human Services authorize Surgeon General make regulations

necessary prevent introduction, transmission, spread communicable diseases foreign countries States possessions, or one State possession State possession.

In response Ebola earlier threats, regulations exist. One authorizes director Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC)

determines measures taken health authorities State possession (including political subdivisions thereof) insufficient prevent spread communicable diseases State possession State possession, he/she may take measures prevent spread diseases he/she deems reasonably necessary.

Indeed, March 14, CDC issued a “No Sail” Order, renewed April 9, banning cruise ships disembarking passengers (many Americans) American port. Why? achieve the priorities of

Preservation human life; preventing introduction, transmission, spread COVID-19 throughout United States; preserving public health critical resources federal, state local governments; [and] preserving hospital, health care, emergency response resources within United States.

However, CDC director yet issued similar “No Non-Essential Travel” order, would restrict interstate travel essential commercial health needs.
The Important Role Travel Restrictions
In likely event allowed so, important remember happened Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918. Locations lifted social distancing mandates early experienced a second surge deaths. Moreover, currently U.S. continues shortages of personal protective equipment, testing kits, essential equipment needed anyone safely say someone coming – example – large cities smaller cities towns, far less health care resources, increasing risks Supreme Court CDC said legally addressed restrictions travel. experts say U.S. needs to triple current testing capacity before social distancing restrictions safely lifted.
The U.S. exceptional. April 17, have many more people – 750,000 confirmed infected coronavirus country, many Americans – over 40,000 – died it. daily totals still rising faster almost anywhere else world. COVID-19 largely spread well-meaning, asymptomatic people – including so-called super-spreaders – put innocent lives risk 50 states.
Conclusion
Now time partisan politics, among governors, Washington. state’s stay-at-home restrictions lawfully allowed continue long governor deems necessary. governors disagree state, CDC Congress mandate nation-wide protection everyone’s lives resources avoid second surge deaths, residents “lenient” states allowed travel states ongoing stay-home orders.  I’m sure anecdotes April found spun interesting ways minutes.. Yeah guess right. guess Mexico side border. Isn’t Orange County Silicon Valley county? Italy central government well, also forbidden regional governments keeping restrictions reopened. legal situation similar USA still movement regions almost two months. Problem Trump jackass. Interesting implying canada actually wants huge influx random americans. dude border closed reason. forgot big one, suck money out! like social security. Robbing poor line pockets rich. illegal, multiple courts already ruled dating back 100 years.

My friend, 100k opportunity. Spending kinesiology degree like hip-hop dance taking opportunity transmuting another Starbucks gig. think U.S. lot louder wearing masks gets media coverage, reality we're Western countries actual usage.

I could find great data it, [IPSOS survey late showed U.S. residents open wearing masks European countries. Another [smaller late May shows similar results.

An [Imperial College / Yougov global survey shows U.S. middle pack wearing masks, still bit higher Germany.

An IPSOS analysis internet conversations showed Americans much concerned opening commerce countries. think (the pressure open early) probably contributes Covid troubles mask usage. Masks easier see report on. Obviously selective makes clear point: almost 200 nations world pandemic around 6 months. last seven days US infections every country world three. showing bad US doing.  They've literally done children repeating garbage parents told them. Feels anything else people. hope gives americans insight immigrants move countries. 

Fuck nationalism even patriotism. takes handful assholes charge make environment unlivably toxic. well... us shut months stated need enact appropriate precautions. Sending back virus exist would moronic. Sweden really seems bringing disease control. things continue going well, maybe another 500-1000 deaths whole infection over, look like rate new infections shrinking, testing seems least decent. It’s dangerous reckless suggest pandemic could weeks months even, regardless measures implemented. dought tax rich not.

Hmmm... looking good right. Things zoom all. bet saying completely wrong. mask offers much protection airborne covid - 19 particles. numerous scientific articles published supporting claim.
Of course, matter much scientific evidence present you, gonna listen seem like one people get daily news Facebook groups run soccer moms. BLM protesters spread virus Help!! Send help!! There's good people common sense destroyed idiots!! sucks hasn’t updated days wasn’t aware county Ohio gone Public Health Advisory Level 4 (purple)? according this, look like there’s really much difference 3 4 alerts, though (And I’m 3 masks mandated it’s really enforced). don’t want either Biden Trump, Kanye. country choose another option write in. That’s saying. I’m comparing anyone anyone. I’m saying people don’t like options presented with, write another option. Don’t dick it. Obama Inside job. Wait... think mixed something /s (1) read article. Children absolutely get spread it.

(2) Teachers staff apparently matter less human beings.

This first time feel lucky introvert. KarenVid-19 ngl think he's kind hot DILF. 🙈🙈🙈 What’s going new swine flu though absolutely wearing masks extremely important, man, fell eugenics super quickly there. Gross.
  
I mention eugenics all. even hint anything done people. assumption part. important thing found imaginary way feel morally superior me. Gross. Absurd. Italy 169 cases per day. France 288.

Don’t know people meant locked inside hating like good redditors? feel way. like we're trapped bunch idiots charge, seem actively trying maximize spread virus airline actually allow this, BTW. responsible reopening.

We talking Florida here, millions tourists thrown picture. Go Food Wine festival! get expensive(most things around 5$) get try lot new foods. I'm genuinely curious though. Sweden never full lockdown, people wearing masks - yet going conventional wisdom, cases per day trending along curve rest EU. Contrast US places like Florida Arizona exploding hospitals overwhelmed - even governors implemented shutdowns May face masks mandatory many establishments. know Swedish strategy come cost though - people died numbers seen Nordic countries (although less per capita Italy, Spain, UK, etc), still situation stabilizing gradually. 


What secret - Swedish exceptionalism? Yes, bet does. NYC 1.6 million residents, additional 1.5million live tri state area commute city work, roughly 67 million tourists come annually. So, roughly 3.5 million people city given point time. 

It also one highest cost living country, unless suddenly people making living wage risking lives?

They also hit multiple terrorist attacks.

Edit: NYC schools annual budget 25Billion, comparison sake. Updating views new information comes along FHM’s strong suit, put mildly. Tuition: lung life... .. ""investigation "".... didn't.... rule not.

#Translation:

#The Swedish Public Health Agency sees reason reconsider recommendations following researchers' alarms coronavirus spread long distances air:


- happen unusual situations, basically infection spreads closely, says Public Health Agency's Director General Johan Carlson.

The question coronavirus spread became relevant 239 researchers last week issued open letter World Health Organization (WHO). According researchers, virus would spread via small droplets, so-called aerosols, thus able travel longer distances two meters many countries recommend safety distance people.

Droplet infection spread short distances relatively large drops sneeze, cough, speak loudly. Aerosol infection spread much smaller droplets accompany exhaled air passed many meters room.

If 239 researchers right, virus could linger longer room infected person been. case, high quality face mask would required protect completely. Simpler protection would provide less protection.
According Swedish Public Health Agency, unlikely type infection would entire explanation coronavirus' way infection:

- thought entirely unlikely certain odd situations certain spaces get type spreading effects. one thing theory another thing important driving force pandemic, says Public Health Agency's Director General Johan Carlson.

And according Carlson, aerosols drive spread infection:

- droplet infection main driving force. Purely epidemiologically, spread infection see. fact cases infection occur ways cause changes policy today. wait see comes with, access data many countries.

- small drops main route transmission, would bit everywhere. that.

Johan Carlson says clear aerosol infection overall society.

- Instead, see slightly random cluster spread. odd disease. Suddenly one two people cause spread infection, exactly clear. Whether lies individual situation.

If aerosol transmission driving force, countries would affected completely different way, according Johan Carlson.

- infection spread throughout countries, see certain places certain regions affected. example, ten major European cities outbreaks, more. virus gives odd pattern means compare Nordic countries countries next other. explanation see aerosol infection something else. 

**So aerosol-powered infection, spread evenly across countries?**

- Yes. would see clusters. cannot rule may occur certain situations. don’t understand people - maybe don’t give shit people, care lives? know masks don’t protect individual 100% (they help slow virus passed others) offer protection. idiots like Cruz care enough lives take even small easy step protect themselves?

How know buddy's gram died cancer COVID prematurely? 

Also, know counted among COVID stats? could indeed skew numbers, although agree disease spreads quickly. end implies aren’t forcing open aren’t stopping either largely based panel month ago opening schools general. Two districts aren’t group aren’t opening hopefully open close based disease levels forecast. think Newsome perfect whole ordeal (especially around masks) first shutdown state, first re-enter state wide lock down. deserve credit imho. people died flu covid. wonder people don’t wear mask. 
If politician’s don’t wear them... they're saying we're *over* reporting everything misattributing deaths covid deaths. 

Or that's I've seen lately. Wasn’t appointed... January 2021 remember getting one Illinois well. listening npr yesterday someone Jacksonville, fl's hospital system speaking. said hospital overflowing 20 - 35 year olds require treatment older generations first hospital wave. said younger people take twice much medicine raise blood pressure keep stable well. middle 50 hour drive quoting exactly, still scary shit generation right now.

Edit: also doctor said patients part healthy, underlying conditions dictating severe condition wasn't. immunity even permanent. might last year only. That's less lethal coronaviruses responsible flu, reason think different.

So vaccine within year, caught back vulnerable again. It’s like republicans competing see ignorant. fair, COVID-19 testing rated 91-95% accurate. look additional information here: last 4 years shown worse evil.

Vaccines add natural ability humans produce herd immunity. Many cases produce strong antibody response lasting one. cases numerous enough compared ones produce response capable granting immunity, herd immunity cannot achieved without assistance vaccine. Using vaccine artificially induce antibody response large portion population significantly reduces number ""natural"" immunities necessary, allowing herd immunity gain traction. Also, vaccines induce stronger antibody responses virus individuals. talk herd immunity flu, aid vaccines making large portion population limits virus.

Also, many kinds vaccines undergoing trials coronavirus, sure using antigen paradigm

Disclaimer: virologist, understanding There’s way becomes worse Black Plague. medical system sophisticated. order get another plague would need something spreads like covid much higher death rate. woman NEVER forget that. give schools though? *each county/city* decides, based crazy are? mean, much work, couldnt tell everyone contact ever confirmed go infected. Well live country people take less seriously. hardware store yesterday signs saying ""masks required"" really enforcing it. Upon checkout wife decided verbally call obvious social degenerate wearing mask. pretty embarrassing honest two got minute. said wear mask already gotten virus 😷🤯🤪😲 Lol, go back r/conspiracy dude. exactly medical science tries find out. immunity possible achieved.

I guess vaccines isn‘t thing don’t get. Science whole seems problem here...

The answer is: DON‘T KNOW YET! chicken pox slightly less lethal elderly relatives rona though Wish somewhere outcasts could run away impatient morons let disease run course...

Sorry hear husband. Solidarity. know lot shit going world really 0 empathy students? Online basically rules college me. I've always trouble focusing real bad experiences online I've done brick mortar classes. Guess I'll taking year off... Many dying sick many weeks even months. Hard times ahead US. bet get go back school hacked?  
 
edit: yes - 
 
I emailed let know Well significant fraction completely ""asymptomatic"", could call 'natually immune. sure anyone possibly ""immune infection"" tho, cause would mean virus incapable infecting cells, regardless initial load. 57 positive cases (out 61) sea 35 days. Well, wages frozen economy plans following 2008 *economic crisis* big rise, big 10 years without salary rise inflation. (extremely educated - one actual college professor) family thinks big joke. literally went camping family trip weekend. mother law keeps insisting distancing wearing masks watching clearly lying. know trauma dealing illness bluff way every time. yesterday sitting eating together porch acting like breaking social distance guidelines. course take mask eat, happened multiple times.

I genuinely understand educated people could fucking idiots. care outside STOP HANGING OTHER. fucks sake one heard Skype? you’re indigenous Brits Internet busy shitting Americans realize idiots country Border Oregon too.

Lol. mean ""fence around Portland"". Yes. think cases emerging. takes time well continued high infection rate reveal immunity fades 3 months. hate Wellcare too. Sec fraud, Medicare fraud Medicaid fraud. wealthiest nation Earth

It definitely is. Statistics confirm comes actual public health &amp; wealth, quality life, infrastructure? countries so-called Third World best it. 

Which exactly asking possible.

You contradict yourself. wealthiest nation, saying peculiar Third World countries besting areas - would expected. not. USA still wealthiest nation world. ""haha dumb, invent things"" Nothing changed.

We’ve wearing masks months. 

Mystery solved. Wife went would say biggest downer crowd size (pre Covid). Everything else get fun. Yes designed kids, yes food sort sucks everything overpriced. park designed people ages fun may come across videos reason millions people go there.  
All said, know crazy person wants go July, none less wear mask day, already gotten virus risk getting exposed it. also helps 40% population already immunity H1N1 outset due surviving many many flu seasons plus flu vaccines.

There also treatment form antiviral drugs help treat flu. friend Joe (his actual name) said it. think it’s general idea. Certainly don’t give credit. go start fundraising them. many entertainment venues open right now? None. indoor dining, bars, malls.

Other retail stores offices nothing open tourists would interest in. in-laws live exact opposite. feel like believe virus even real. bite tongue much speak bleed. satire? yes, might want think pointing out. borrowing this. I've looking succinct one word response ""Sheep!"" comments. Thank that. WOW. Just.... WOW! Apparently taking precautions thing acting like virus exist.

Why everything need turned something political? I'm even conservative, anywhere close. home depot Wal-Mart open schools. 
-desanitizer Better explanation horseshit tests junk. Yes thank you.

So saying possible bodies can't produce effectiveantibodies COVID-19 caught wild, produce effective COVID antibodies dead version COVID? would public option ever get better funds siphoned schools? list countries Americans banned right now? I’ve trying explain boyfriend “Everywhere else numbers really low here. cross borders?” can’t find link places won’t allow us in. take still haven’t read constitution eh? 60% boroughs believed think stat like 32% households pay mortgage/rent July (granted month over). Evictions allowed July, go up. Like...what, going allow 50% fucking Americans able pay HOUSING?  there's seemingly ever expanding list ways virus affect people we're focused respiratory symptoms. there's logic problems here, 2.5 trillion estimate (if correct) include money government get back taxes fica result money going back out. 3 million account national local security risk first responders (particularly armed forces) got sick simultaneously. million per life assumes lives equal value, clearly government don't. much worth change presidents odds 10% 1% 0.01% supreme court congress doctors, hell even lowering odds warren buffett steve jobs would worth quite bit more. 

as mentioned earlier, mosquito net wonders malaria problem, government mandated mask wearing would done wonders covid problem, even point government chose spend 2.5 trillion (your number) rather send masks every household require worn. want thank American neighbours running experiment there. really helps us understand beneficial measures taken really are. Thank taking bullet team. 

I think scientists would agree it’s important keep borders closed continue experiment without confounding factors. made up. anything Kushner would want pandemic end hurting bottom line. get hot New York? Yet impose masking public places. also opened open spaces, parks, ski resorts (March-May). 

Yeah, ok, Polis. corporate overlords must proud. True, people already lower guards. demanding keep vaccine proper cure available. indeed airborne, *that* airborne... mean, long active hotspots anywhere country, place really safe spikes. NE hit hardest locked longest. Good bringing infections down. Good luck keeping way. say x number cases hospital admissions tests?

Tests, would case number death numbers higher, lower same?

Mostly (nationally anyway), know deaths lag cases. think reasonable expect daily death count go up, I'm sure we'll see March/April levels again. Hopefully not, states making tough. fuck thing happen again? Rush song YYZ, Toronto. Also you: ""I learned decade"" fucking lol Chinese winning probably won’t fly over. sucks $1200 flight credit expires next spring. wear mask okay, dont wear mask catch much easier.

This getting tripped up. masks protect people, they're protect people you. That's get frustrated people say ""their body, choice"". 

It's kinda like someone saying drive without insurance ""their car, choice."" missing point bad, point missing big obvious, difficult ascribe malice. ignorance comments baffling, goes show people truly believe anything long someone else tells true, that's true downfall ""can't vectors"" less others - reports Finland, Norway, Denmark France lack effect increased transmission schools. Stupid.

50% country read 8th grade level. Nice username OP. Sad article. 
I’m torn looked post history real homie American people. I'd looking permanent status dual citizenship. almost started restaurant covid hit America even moved red st@te blue st@te start it, watching america's response entire global health crisis, interest starting business waned exponentially. think November telling stay start business move country gives shit population. people given extra $600 per week free give church that’s want do.

But yes, never cash injection church. Would pretty easy find out. even posted link exactly explains works still didn’t get it. 

We know vaccines work general decades now. don’t know works SARS-COV2 yet. don’t know immune forever lasts couple months years. develop immunity all. far close beliefs far many  Bruh, fucking FEEL THIS. What's worse people judge shit supposed doing! Like no, I'm going so-and-so's get together, give shit everyone swears fucking bible they're going social distance wear masks, know damn well can't drink beer swim pool wearing mask, WTF wrong you? studied origins public schooling purposes meant fulfill, vehemently disagree. purpose create informed voting populace free thinkers. teachers work truly work this. certain populations government severely undereducated folks keep trying hold us back real work calling “indoctrination”. thought (the polls), don’t think would persuaded anyone left come side, people middle right switched sides due actions. might tighter race, though. comes getting people vote matter what. Hopefully people don’t get complacent current numbers. It’s good see people shaming people positions power following laws rules especially time like this! Wear damn mask! It’s hard! pls share texas florida sub Honestly think combination people spoiled hearing want hear. ""Well, serious would close beaches must big deal"" seems general attitude. ""I'm young get sick anyway problem"". Yeah, thats completely true. Everything expensive here, salaries lower pay taxes. deal plus cold weather bad  opening border Swedish travelers abolishing quarantine rules. announced German Embassy Sweden website.  lifts travel restrictions Swedish travelers today thus abolishes requirement 14 days quarantine applies now.  thus free travel Germany Sweden travelers without valid travel reasons travel routes.  decision abolish travel restrictions made view fact spread infection Sweden falling, German embassy writes website. time, Sweden lifting restrictions travel Germany.

As German living Sweden, quite happy. Three states (NY, NJ MA) make 40% total COVID deaths country. great northeast seems past first wave really going turn around taunt rest country get hit this? That’s interesting since differs GREATLY doctor saying cnn folks hospitals ICUs ages 55 85”

Edit: I’m saying lying, would love could provide source. I’m skeptical you’re saying would differ hospital statistics established past 6 months across every affected region world. no. Don’t it. Don’t start spreading idea Americans start sneaking Canada or
Coming en masse. 

We’ve done solid job containing virus. border flooded Americans right lead massive resurgence
Of virus put everyone Canada back jeopardy. know guys pissed. Fleeing Canada isn’t answer. 

Sort shit out. Get organized. Work together. tools communication safely. Take country back you’ll support whole way. don’t start flooding right now. 

If covid weren’t happening maybe, put us immense risk right now. Ah, good old r/coronavirus. Don’t let facts data get way narrative. know Florida’s total deaths per million far par Germany Denmark, despite significantly older population? They’ll certainly end higher it’s hilarious watching people’s heads explode comparatively, small number deaths per day. way he's wrong? fox Cases = positive tests. typically find hospital admissions state's health department. love use numbers manipulate things. course .02% sounds like *nothing* conservatives go that. say actual number, 4,250, much bigger thing. 

I'm trying put anyone down, interesting happens every time (like Devoss .1% thing). interesting. Reporter : specific guidelines schools?

Betsy: I'm medical expert need open schools look guidelines like CDC.

Reporter: what, specifically?

Betsy: every school need guidelines places different.

Reporter: Yes, places different, contradicting first saying everyone needs open saying every place thing. *specifically* schools use guidelines?

Betsy: examples private sector. need open schools.

Reporter everyone else: *heads explode baffled rage* idea.. live Sweden people using masks here.. Besides, I've locking sick. So, sorry, can't help  Also bear mind you’re comparing proven COVID-19
deaths vs estimated flu deaths. Obviously covid-19 deaths proven. response always ""yeah, difference opinion. opinion wrong, mine right.""

""The U.S. Supreme Court also dealt right travel case Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489 (1999). case, Justice John Paul Stevens, writing majority, held United States Constitution protected three separate aspects right travel among states:

(2) right treated welcome visitor rather hostile stranger (protected ""Privileges Immunities"" clause Article IV, § 2), and

(3) (for become permanent residents state) right treated equally native-born citizens (this protected 14th Amendment's Privileges Immunities Clause; citing majority opinion Slaughter-House Cases, Justice Stevens said, ""the Privileges Immunities Clause Fourteenth Amendment . . . always common ground Clause protects third component right travel."")."" summon anyone court serve papers.

These death days could also suggest virus already hit significant amount vulnerable population first went through. believe case rates better barometer whether mitigation strategies effective.

I think bit exaggeration say ""If everyone United States wore mask 3 weeks — 3 weeks — would anymore coronavirus, would spread, people want wear masks"" would still spread, masks **significantly reduce spread virus**. remember huge deal either, maybe mostly concentrated Americas something? Reminds story Fort Myers, FL mother, nurse less, conspiracy theorist, purposely took daughter church sanctioned event. event included 100 children masks/ distancing optional. church publically made statements supporting anti mask stance defiance, labeled Covid party. intentionally get virus ""get with"". daughter immuno compromised. got it, mother gave hydroxy whatever gave oxygen grandfather's tank finally took hospital.

http://orange.floridahealth.gov/ kids get virus lol think point arguably it’s little better normal thats 'sickening' fragile substantial proportion patients suffer kidney Yes, actually, crux. Students unwilling put individual effort learn material. Ask professor -- even sympathetic ones tell same. 

It's also partly students' fault. indeed overcome insufficiency knowledge, (shocker) takes work. Neither students parents willing bare minimum. course! country almost single handedly keeping imperial system alive. happy simplify things. too. grateful parents taking seriously. think could handle virus deniers. course must. open back number daily cases have, one outcome. there’s permanent immunity disease makes confident vaccine work better you’re immune system?

Temporary immunity fine comes vaccine, since keep getting vaccinated every year whatever effective duration is.

Repeatedly getting disease another proposition entirely.

Nah, he’s busy sheltering mansion can’t bring kids field trips. Mandatory masks? look like anarchist scum? thing truly airborne transmitted respiratory droplets need wearing full MOP suits gas masks want perfectly safe. mask going squat virus microns across. mesh masks might well air scale. panacea worst means cover identities certain scum stage yet another cultural revolution. UK. I'd like thank United States contribution getting us thing Florida lottttttt hospitals already. Take fact density, lot lower NYC. cases much spread out. explains hospitals run yet. However, breaking point, matter many hospitals have. Oh get want sow distrust basically guy getting mostly right government. man trusted Reagan, HW Bush, Clinton, W Bush, Obama. Trump used like prop. 
From source: “I think there’s enough evidence say best benefit people COVID-19 protect giving COVID-19 people, **but you’re still going get benefit wearing mask don’t COVID-19,**” said Chin-Hong.

Knock off. Okay. help get streets? situations Denmark Sweden similar pandemic. Masks protect idiot , stop spreading misinformation propaganda bullshit That’s whole point. court. post-fine enforcement mechanism. don’t pay fine, penalty. would never end court Especially quite number patients reported either relapses reinfecfions. Happened Vancouver - city one know even knows anyone it, one woman twice. Sweden population ten million.

According Worldometers data, death rate per million 548, that's seventh highest world.

Ranked France, Italy, US.

They still stand chance catching UK Spain.

Their total deaths seem low, country small.

In comparison, live State Michigan US.

We huge problem COVID Spring.

Population, also 10 million.

In States, ranked 8th deaths per 1 million 633.

Sweden 548.

We one hardest hit states early on. shut 2.5 months get numbers middle exponential growth.

Sweden never seemed reach exponential spread virus, numbers still mirror hardest hit densely populated states US.

They achieved flattening curve maintained it. How? Why? know, seems Swedes least took pandemic seriously enough social distance properly follow government guidelines.

In US feels like minority many places understood seriousness situation. Mask wearing less important folks actually social distanced. point contention US many taking precautions unwittingly spreading virus.

Sweden's average age 41, US 38. Sweden much healthier country; 10% pop obese US 40%.

With last data set mind, Sweden actually seeing lower death rate now.

Even Health Director pushed current strategy said Mid June would liked see tighter lock down.

So yes, Swedes may exceptional, compared American counterparts. Upvote upvoting smooth brains. ""uh, excuse me. circle actually square."". can't. looks like might happen wont was

try 200.....thats guess. also endangered life sitting U.S. Senator. really dawned visiting local cemeteries seen... quite fresh graves, usual. crazy. glimpse politicians think since help write laws, they're them. I'm hoping Cruz gets virus, hope irresponsible inaction cause anyone get it. However think forced put isolation 14 days know he's spreading around DC. agree part. lockdown basically shut businesses, people still moved around decent bit. 

Things got control lifted people went back living like before. even added things like protests various reasons (mask, statues, BLM, anti-lockdown, etc.) went crazy holidays beaches. Kept Church services.

There never going point 100% eradicated US. things mentioned, would protests.

re: countries - wonder numbers look good test lot...or maybe people scared get tested authoritarian gov? Vietnam 92 million people. read they've performed 275,000 tests. That's WAY LOW amount people. test 3X day here. people around. It’s busy hike trails narrow. People also breathing hard less air 10,000 feet.

I go walks neighborhood don’t wear mask, cross street someone side. hate runners run breathing hard. Thanks dude...just thanks... test positive. Oh that's right, send wild spread more.

Testing bullshit unless actually something isolate people seriously dense don’t understand masks protect around you, yourself? impossible think others around you? DAMN. I, joke Yeah don’t know everyone’s downvoting true. exactly going pay rent suddenly quit job? people joke teacher pay, it’s broken hour make short $30/hour one lowest paid states first year level. second job (because figure contracts 196 days 37.5 hours/week), second job hourly pays barely half existing hourly rate. walk true minimum wage job it’s around $8/hour live. open schools already. Younger folks proven time time take seriously. give American essential workers fucking raise? least especially unemployment benefits non-essential workers pay bump many cases. would fully support essential worker strike point could get deserve real quick. stopped flying United back watched old man front pass exhaustion collapse floor waiting customer service line 6 hours (took 8 actually get front...).

He collapsed floor single employee damn thing even whole queue people hollering help. Took 15 minutes get man wheelchair help. ran found cop come help. United never damn thing, Newark airport staff terminal.

United care people sounds like neither American Airlines. don’t think that’s saying. took years air travel return normal 9/11; vaccine people reluctant return things seen high risk illness post pandemic. surprised. ""Fuck you, got mine"" American motto decades now. funny guy. needed that. bad enough way without misleading exactly bad is. don’t find comfortable all.  Clearly active duty lawyer active duty constitutional scholar says jack shit inability restrict interstate travel travel (not may, will, Americans *will* die) spread worst plague human history. really, buy necessary materials bulk able entire time. IMHO impossible buy materials masks government already bought all. takes village raise child... even child 30s Ugh, hear thing New Brunswick. here, great. want here? No? wear mask. Good luck getting 70% show government already gave number knows everything you. force wear seatbelt walk around nude.

Shove peace good health ass. Wear mask stop selfish moron. keep telling people go killed x.

Yes killed X shut fucking world it. Regarding contact tracing, far know, positive cases hospitalised matter severe symptoms are. Symptomatic suspected cases sent fever clinics set deal exclusively Covid cases (so aren’t infecting hospital patients). fever, that’s go. get contact traced (eg flight train positive case) taken government quarantine, apparently usually business hotel, two weeks. free charge. March still allowing foreigners country, home quarantine permitted. people come take temp twice day also bring deliveries ordered food/groceries etc. Motion sensors cameras installed make sure people didn’t try leave. pleasant perhaps effective. multiple testing sites around city (Shanghai), tests cost $17 nucleic acid test $6.50 antibody test. It’s impressive thorough system is. Shanghai low level cases throughout consequently never general lockdown people general allowed go outside. Update: Östergötland 2,78% positivity rate week 28. Way go! [Governor DeFarquaad](http://imgur.com/gallery/cjhZNNY) want prosecute that? There’s long line people block first. time “second wave” started hit, masking already stressed important component mitigating pandemic. AZ, FL, TX, rest spiking areas fucked own. You’re talking quote March you’re going blame confusion that, 3 months consistent messaging task force? I’m northeast it’s 80s 90s last several weeks. Try again. Show said virus would eliminated mean, anything better nothing, ideally want tightly woven material maximum effectiveness. 

That said, depending old toddlers are, either may need wear masks wear masks. believe current thinking they're actually harmful 2 group, lot places mandate exempted children younger around 4-5 years old. it. Schools germfests. I'm teacher. I’m OC. notified school yesterday we’re pulling kid fall. I’d surprised don’t reverse decision fall, we’re world hurt Carter Heavy Industries. Safe ignore  Frats disgusting.... accidentally caused norovirus outbreak one staying days college boyfriend frat classes let out. got really sick and, remember missing toilet cases, I'm sure communal bathroom area cleaned sufficiently (I weak get bed make sure happened right away). entire rest frat house ended getting sick. Norovirus crazy contagious, COVID-19 seems much so. Frat houses breeding grounds germs grossness perfect places uncontrollable outbreaks. kognitiv dissonans feeling going lot parents like choose start child school year. blame you. Local law enforcement (at least southern oregon) absolutely refuse enforce this. also refuse respond tresspass call due customer refusing wear mask. First ""kids susceptible"". ""kids less likely spread it"". Hmm.

Anyway, feel free link articles saying otherwise. wearing masks NYC since March. Basically everyone. understanding enders body threw mouth nose. absorbed body. leech threw skin. 
So wearing mask holes covered okay. wash hands food buy. 

How non mask person endangering mask wearers. how’s situation madrid? people distancing? facial covering mandated?  would highly suggest it. Considering things going right now, next weeks could crazy. I’m shamed American right now. unhinged shown significant portion Americans don’t give one flying fuck people. literally care since leaders saying big thing (70k new cases yesterday BTW) don’t want inconvenienced even slightest. “Let people die gonna die cause ain’t gonna me”

It’s horrendous. Americans suck. forget Trump pondered can't inject household cleaners.

what say *exactly* son - that's quality projection.

you doth project much. never woke son. GA here. Ever since virus got bad New York I've seen lot New Yorker's here. seems 1 every 10 cars there's NY plate. Wtf. many areas, total deaths though. people going less, driving less, etc. 
  
So difficult way account. Detected. Can't imagine government anything... Face shields reduce shedding asympto children. speed limits individual? Internal investigation doubt. Lmao literally said exact quote. Go read original comment. Here, copied you: ""Can confirm... Bay Ridge last night saw 20-30 people per block clusters crammed together eating outside. masks whatsoever. might well eating inside. number blocks? 10. People get sick again. People walking around? 20% wearing masks... :/""

No one disagreeing transmission possible outside careful. given lack spike protests, studies, vast majority transmission indoors. whole thing started fear mongering false comment ignores fact, general common sense air moves indoors vs outdoors. Even sitting feet someone talking holds far risk indoors vs outdoors Word! believe wearing masks drop r-value enough eliminate virus? never heard anyone believe possible point. remember seeing videos people literally chained apartment buildings quarantine, thinking fuck wrong country?

Now, looking back, looks like responded appropriately.  sound random.

Somewhat like picking random integer 1 3 (not including 1 3).

People retail environment (statisically) random sample people NYC. Photo clearly staged told smile 

In real world won’t easy. many constantly take off? investigation? arrest. letting infractions go without consequence encourage allow behavior endangers us all. That's worldwide number believe. US number around 400k someone works medical field Manitoba... post garbage.

The reason Manitoba faired well businesses schools shut quickly people stayed home. weather March/April miserable, wasn’t hard do.

There also culture caring Winnipeg. People actually show respect care communities, family coworkers. even one active case province, still see people physical distancing wearing masks. think know ""investigation"" ends tests shown might 3 weeks, thats guessing, changes depending people, strenght antibodies depends person healthy unhealthy lead basically useless someone HIV unhealthy case one thing also virus severe Yes, right, decrease numbers countries lockdowns luck. causality. Go on, dont question.  car accidents count well? another ""woe me"" article? You’re still going reach herd immunity, without unacceptable death toll. it’s possible immunity lasts couple months anyway. honestly seems like better idea masks kids age, good luck keeping either one them. realize 138k dead **because** social distancing lockdown. Estimates put deaths 2-3 million US alone end year prevent spread.

Who kidding, argue good faith. idea swine flu killed many, thought 5-10k range. Take scrap fabric want use exhale onto mirror. perfect test, give general idea much moisture getting through, may lot little depending tight weave is. Well fair, everyone regards. point post last seven days, new cases countries **TOTAL** (except three others). words, recorded cases *in last 7 days* Peru, Chile, Mexico, Spain, UK, South Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Italy etc. recorded *since pandemic began*. too! exactly I’ve worried RI too. doesn’t take many people mess us. Wow, really poor timing unrelated pneumonia deaths right now. got wrong Korea. think 10k upto date Unfortunate people couldn’t learn early lessons (Florida here) got links nation shutdown kept schools open? Dont go college! seriously. dont teach anything fundamentals developing real value. best, condition work hard meet deadlines, pretty much everything learn undergrad studies learn own. totally worth price tag way things going now, better setting goal create something that's valuable others. 

I never set foot film class make films money. never went business school I'm positioned make lot money trading I'm starting company.

All skills learned outside college. College gave depression, anxiety, whole bunch debt. Biggest sham U.S we're brainwashed believing path success. successful college grads ones continue learning figure leverage value maximize benefits. 

And dont teach that. Seriously. Waste time money. Oh sure! still pain 2.5 months later. breathing exercises really helped that.

I don’t know lungs ever get back 100%,. Even 5 months later, still breathing exercises occasion, considering, good enough. excellent Sure, missed point. Plus one this, tap water US good too... minus problem spots, typically safe, filtered good go. people backwards idea ""tap water bad"" bombed ads non stop buy bottled water. Good news Sweden? TenDaysTenPoops must devastated.  firearm something petty ignored.

waving gun guy trying help makes sense. mean talking high schooler barely making much trying best inform guy, guy threatened him? someone threatened workplace gun? mean, really? bad, stop shit.  chickenshit move. They've abandoned elected duty deny blame things go bad take full credit works out. Think upside: cause girlfriend worry morning breath! No, point there...it's spent. relief money printed stacked national debt. There's limit.  wearing gloves unceccesary? always worn mask disposable gloves. Making sure dispose gloves used washing hands. Avoiding touching face wearing them.

I’m wondering... top here? imagine wearing ensuring wash hands could work ""Texans [in constituency] comply..."" Yeah thinking must difficult... I'm sure there's. Lot high rise apartments Miami &amp; Phoenix... traveled ac effectively enough would basically impossible avoid. Counts high think entire complexes infected.

Thanks. would fly million dollars lol  There's way many labs astronomically high percent positive rates much stock put recent confirmed cases. Like labs seen positive rate 22 times higher positive test rate county located. sample sizes 100 labs really hard believe something weird going would largely explain it. pretty hard believe multiple labs processed 300 tests gotten single negative result due dumb luck. Someone answer somewhere something off. Florona. Go ahead don’t shutdown — virus doesn’t give shit, keep spreading. People get sick hospitals like war zone. Exactly right thought crown thumbnail. Appears lives sale governments. least know stand. Especially this:

“I speak Swedish well enough to, say, listen summer talks.”

Why leave obviously wrong translations you’d know it’s wrong? think either shows bad faith you’re cherry picking bad translations works (the purpose). reason CDC sidelined politicized make ineffective allow role privatized. part goal current regime.  make mistake Republicans 4 years ago, Biden racist old fuck dementia, saying whatever advisors tell to. Vote JoJo! study posted times.

The good news 55% hospitalized patients, skewed towards severe cases

The bad news fucking idea percentage mild moderate cases, permanent damage is. evidence lung damage mild cases, can't take heart damage table made claim kids less likely spread virus. haven’t supported claim. You’ve supported part less likely get seriously ill. part less likely spread it. 

With studies showing asymptotic spread main way virus spread, kids mild symptoms one would conclude kids likely spread less likely. project one labs live SARS-CoV-2 US they’re seeing 48-72 hours Petri dish, sure correlates plastic whatever else. thing scares think estimates refrigerated even frozen surfaces must figured good way ~~extract~~ raise donations church members offsite. cold... y'all Canadians come balance stupid states There's much do. Every restaurant open outdoor dining. drink streets. Rooftop bars open. Beaches Open. Central Park running. Mass Transit running fine.

Last weekend went wedding party backyard bar; weekend went 230 5th roof top bar, weekend took train NJ went hike. Make 30 weeks please... aren’t “relatively safe states”, that’s false narrative creates false sense belief hope. Covid doesn’t care state lines. Many states well statistically population already socially distanced. Rural areas groups hundreds people ever meet might success right now, put kids families back school? You’re bound spread would likely avoidable without person school. Opening schools rural areas end main source spread. world shut loud dumb leaders decided ego important lives citizens. completely safe children (or safe activity) go back school. issue staff, older folks home germy kids spread to.  shouldn’t.

If read link posted says clearly bold 

“testing programs scaled size epidemic, size population.”

And “Looking positivity rate (ie, tests conducted, many came back positive COVID-19) reliable way determine government testing enough”

So compare Brazil’s positivity rate 33.2, USA’s 6,28, note Brazil cases US despite testing nearly enough smaller population USA, see things bad indeed Brazil. Poor guy! Dickhead Finally country average! Yey us! I’d say maybe little misinformed, easy ridiculous climate. Speaking insurance, funny covid ran insurance companies dry, switched single payer? real fuck you. dream would be.  Yes yes, mean text said Sweden also lifted something surprised me. Newark airport staff

There's real problem. airport Newark like black hole anything good positive. can't imagine working Hellmouth still maintaining shred empathy joy. 

Seriously, travel desperately poor areas poorest countries world, single one airports ever depressing soul-sucking Newark's. I've even paid extra tickets layover anywhere else, avoid spending 3 hours Newark airport. sad thing school district Boise/Meridian, rural. Boise still gets lot influence rural crazies, though. current theoretical maximum 8 months - additional data next month could move 9 months. September may indicate 10 months whole month**, Board Education held meeting **experts** concluded white paper requiring students wear masks “is difficult may even harmful time.” 

1) ""Experts"". Yeah, right. mention supposed experts were.

2) Last month, shit got real Orange County. Herd immunity? Lol exactly. never celebrate Valentine's Day, mother's day, father's day. something special random days officials Monday finalized new data reporting protocol hospitals, eliminate Centers Disease Control Prevention data recipient, leaving health-care institutions report information covid-19 federal contractor state, would coordinate federal reporting.


It’s fascism disaster movie, one. Mask wearing protected class ADA necessariky apply medical crises. actually surprisingly small compared generally thought. left infect? Umm checked population rate. Yep. People toss “go work trades” way people told fuck go work mines. old man machinist worked till died beat cut up. Hot every day summer cold every day winter. Everyone worked told never did. Trades vital honorable treat like shit country. think get celebrate yet. know good NY, never charge virus, dealing it.

No one Upstate NY wearing masks anymore drinking cup coffee. picture cropped. Decently high, far lower cutoff threshold though, I've heard 40-50k instead last time's 75k Teachers TX union cannot strike risk losing employment, retirement pension. Teachers 401k. Teachers strike potentially throwing away degree/career, salary, retirement savings. Tired Wynning  except nobody ever incentivized over-report cases Swine flu love everyone thinks people somehow magically cured greed cognitive biases there's pandemic panic every news cycle 

wtf wrong everyone? called [Cobra well documented understood thinking \*ahem\* immune effects ""because reasons"" defies historical president 

but decide include /r/forwardsFromKlanDma post make mistake - im precautionary measures 

we need take measures protect vulnerable people (wear masks, maintain distancing i.e. flatten curve) effects clearly bad viral infection gone awry combined medical system clearly unable cope spike cases wont cause unnecessary deaths (especially vulnerable members communities)

a discussion part problem still pending probably fall cracks hysteria politically opposed blaming health insurance conglomerates continue laughing way bank; leaving us collectively unprepared next pandemic's infection surge, process

having said - simply believe numbers published people coming incentive schemes (and measured based success thereof) lacks bare minimum level skepticism differentiates sensible person hysterical one 

apropos, inflated mortality rates also serve narrative impossible prepare eventuality

a public perception towards advances agenda stand held accountable failure adequately prepare us eventualities 

however, doubt prepared. designated jobs precisely that, failed jobs 

how know possible prepared? countries were, fact, prepared

to wit 35k deaths 250k reported cases 5k deaths 75k reported cases

so keeping score 

Sweden reported 0.0075 infection rate infections 0.06 mortality rate 

Italy reported 0.0042 infection rate infections 0.14 mortality rate 

so infection rate roughly comparable (in fact Sweden reported per capita Italy) within margin error 

the mortality rate +100% Italy

why?

is Swedes genetically superior Italians die less? perhaps Sweden stricter lockdown rules get infected much (hint: cuz Sweden higher infection rate fewer restrictions)? maybe pickled herring superior immunity diet olives? 

these possibilities dont come near Occam's razor Swedish medical system cope surge patients spare capacity. budgeted prepared ADVANCE precaution 

in Italy shut country flatten curve tax payers paid extra new case reported (in process encouraging loved ones deceased patients sign cases death anything period ""Corona-related complication"" order collect coping bounty)

Sweden able cope surge infections cautiously went business minimal restrictions - critically discussion - incentivized report number deaths infections simply Sweden extra grants treating patients infected COVID-19 treated - continue treated - like patient condition won’t “occur” (appear data) another week least...the incubation period usually 4-10 days reporting delay tests another week. know hell earth don’t extend this...   save horrific pandemic lose job! parents pay college car, like mine did! takes little discipline hundred thousand dollars! need work survive, that's American way! Service guarantees citizenship! brother Erik Prince, blackwater fame? Police that, airline. Trump. Republicans. boyfriend sounds like idiot. pro wrestler huge improvement point? would want pay voters right election? Depends. find KN95s bought comfortable. Visitors? like residents. know plenty people homes NY also homes Florida Arizona. people going back forth that's shit going fry us all. good luck trying lock states. many ways out. need shutdown control virus. need stop pretending virus go away. think Nov-Jan (election season) go? game plan guess based we're seeing now? comments turn political, have. duty fellow reddit ruin everyone's fun report post, locked gone AWOL broken fundamental core values Coronavirus: Avoid Politics. I'm sorry guys, r/Coronavirus learning new safety measures effectively control virus. who's right wrong spectrum. 乁( •_• )ㄏ.

Again I'm sorry, due actions some, post detracted bigger picture defeating virus staying healthy. sold seat GTFO OK right screwed sorry.

They might also picked course action. thanks person pointed previous attempted submission article fact broken link. 

As is, first saw article posted Greg Dworkin Twitter, Dworkin excellent Twitter follow things related COVID19. - 14 16 *Bundesländer* - requirement 14 days quarantine coming high risk country (according RKI, Sweden, Luxemburg, WHO)
And Sweden warnings countries restrictions mistaken. Sweden shutdown kept primary schools open higher infection among teachers among general populace. children higher infection vector (as normal flu) see sick teacher numbers too. 

Do example country shutdown kept schools open?  right way better states whats point? got billions dollars 'congress' course going say anything Uh what? stock market economy. think people convinced federal reserve move heaven earth never let market drop much, long. Musical chairs. health crisis ADA exemptions apply. rules. airlines not? Same: Rhode Island, brags testing. 10-days 2 weeks behind now. 

My friend test last Tuesday, go hospital yesterday, got tested (has classic Covid symptoms, including pneumonia) *still* hasn’t gotten test results ... yet Governor’s making decisions reopening based test results 😣 Unfortunately, is. Hes making fun semantics. Hes making fun Swedish style...

In volvo? Volvos safe. 

The pollenfilter new volvos 100% Corona proof 40% time! 
- Volvo-fact-of-the-day. 👑  Promising, there’s reason researchers say “mice lie, monkeys exaggerate.” No, recording lectures actually good idea. need shorter concept based lessons rather exactly would taught person. student ask questions stuff discussion forums students prof. Even report shows important distinction Sweden kept schools open kids 15 think. total lockdown definitely protect society semi shutdown. 

We still understand health damage sustained even mild cases contained outbreak better. guys like you, Mickey... Recipe disaster! Even states trying take action I've seen.  madness.  collective apathy deadly disease. Unwillingness right thing slight inconvenience wear mask. re: countries - keep reading, country country great covid. They're great!

There LOT factors go this:

Lets look Vietnam - 92 million people. read they've performed somewhere around 275,000 tests. (Note: I'm sure number increased recently.) That's WAY LOW amount people. test 3X day 4X population. that's roughly equivalent us 1 days worth testing entire pandemic.

Then, look factors like country wear masks regularly? Well, US masks thing. But, lot parts world, common pandemic.

Then, listen country listens government. US, protest everything. We're country rebels. saw news yesterday Pittsburgh protestors stopping police reporting work.

Then, look country tourist destination. US many spots people vacation to. generally move around. countries that?

Then, look politics politicians. US, States rights. get 50 different responses. largely politicized US. TERRIBLE done. But, sides want use results bash side instead unifying peoples health well-being.

Then, look factors like air conditioning, electric, geography, temperature, etc. states getting hit huge way, generally hot people stay indoors AC...which blow around virus. likely contributes some. countries largely use AC?

re: Geography - country island? see lot people point well island that's hard get controls covid. Well default, island helps border control.

Also, time factor. Places bad look better several months new hotspots pop up. could US countries.

So overall point that, yes numbers bad US, LOT factors go evaluating well country responding covid.  think stretching definition NIMBY bit, usually means someone support something benefit long negatives impact them, like needing electricity wanting live near power plant. NIMBYs know something bad happening want happen someone else experience it. Oh, don’t disagree all. responding actual mission public schools, reasons behind push return person schooling. 

As teacher, want safest ways return coworkers especially students. working hard communicate actual solutions representatives parents area can. firmly believe teachers know work (and worked teachers around US) capable providing genuine learning experiences remotely given resources so. 

Will exactly great in-person? No, course not. adapt! know group people incredible flexible, educators. issue people educators making decisions without asking input! Actively ignoring pandemic nothing. requires great deal work ignorant. Upstate NY many people wear masks outside, seem social distance. Almost everyone wears inside.

Private gatherings concern. Ive seen people neglectful masks someones house. treat customers like shit. someone works customer service, tell without doubt, customer almost never right. What's investigate? There's picture lol Jesus imagine union rep room negotiated away ability strike. Except they're looking avoid like plague, they're wrong they're here. case, yes - one reason *only* - **this opened class-action lawsuit.** Paywall. Record low deaths Sweden also. issues driving takes long, time spent traveling could used destination. Germany?  Wow. level truthlessness truly depraved. describing *is* lag time symptoms mortal outcomes. accounting way poor outcomes infected medical systems overloaded at-risk demographics exposed. look NYC regular capacity saturated. young person, exposure overwhelmingly unlikely cause death hospital access guaranteed (there may long term effects, though) present who's spreading disease. may take several weeks even months transmissions virus penetrate community way vulnerable. time, hospitals fill *and* testing backlog increase *but* mortality appear stabilize. Cases US really ever go down, gone yet absence New York's explosive rise nationwide testing capacity increases. really, really important diminish danger something understand it. sign waiver COVID-19 well.

The argument players took risks many years ago first started playing.  Thank you, dear leaders. generous step father-in-law baggage handler AA. told flights always full now. That’s disaster waiting happen COVID. Masks save amazing (not really amazing) actual leaders leadership positions levels governments (local, state, federal). get sick school parties, see help, make worse... Certainly. Hopefully years time won’t still feel like start pandemic.   Karen: drove passed hospital....The parking lot empty. agree, think needs safety measures, definitely arguing that. see many posts simply don’t understand even misunderstand, like post I’m replying to, plight working class parents. knowing demographic Reddit guess can’t say I’m surprised. really overestimate much scientists get paid cost living DC area lol Positive cases gone restricting tests again. can't remember Austin area Texas. Honestly stats positive cases hospitalizations provide enough information. I'm concerned possibility mild cases organ damage can't find stats either. prevalent this? Depending whether rare, uncommon, common huge deal. b v e h e l w folks trying hardest downplay all. arrived craving ice cream awakened idea.

That personal highlight, sounds like Swedes following sort ice cream religion. wondering thing. many job/insurance losses, people dying, yet say economy great, beautiful, bigly, Dow goes up. 
How trading much money &amp; getting richer many Americans losing? Insane...I friends still cant breathe easily covid. would anyone gamble health? People want shit Florida.

Edit: realized said shit florida, which, mean guess do. sorry, making point here. multiple times dead Sweden yet 1 reported case teacher dying.

Denmark also says children increase infection. Norway Finland. Another coronavirus party?  mean EU drugs Agency approves says safe, government agencies also follow approvals, guess would risk taking vaccine.

Though granted bit fishy fast tested. german breads would probably taste even better grams sugar always ""disciplined spending"" finance nerds. truth corporations keeping wages shareholders owners get richer richer. original argument US may lose nukes loss trust

No one made argument. I'm sure Senator Cruz get stern letter airline. people already infected lockdown won’t work. Sooner later test treat them. That’s happened. Wish leaders could’ve acted sooner. It’s insane, looking numbers makes radical eyes. Well see:
""Biden Obama stopped testing,” Trump said. “They stopped it. probably know that. I’m sure don’t want report it. stopped testing. Right middle, went, ‘No testing.’”

This real quote. easiest buy from, also source directly manufacturers using purchasing agent like wegobuy cssbuy.

As various materials, bought small batches ebay, amazon etc. large orders use purchasing agents alibaba. personal use usually sample manufacturer give enough fabric needs. (Samples usually free expect 1-7$ meter non woven melt blown polypropylene)

Edit: purchasing agent usually necessary requesting samples. Many manufacturers sample forms directly website alibaba listings. definitely near high. I've concerns long-term impacts still big unknown. know COVID could difference carrying around oxygen tank 70 versus mostly healthy many people (i.e. effects could subtle short-term. I've read articles non-hospitalized divers 'mild' cases longer able dive appears rest lives). However, hospitalization rates severe symptoms young adults relatively **1.04**% hospitalized

30-39: **3.43%** hospitalized

40-49: **4.25%** hospitalized opposed ice cream scoop doesn’t reach bottom container due shambolic handling pandemic. much normally hate Cuomo kicking ass right now.   still paying insurance high taxes. get insurance expensive here, options choose from. Canada last resort. Karen: Wanna get brunch? know adorable place san Antonio bellinis die for! 
Caren: hear people actually dying covid there
Karen : bellinis! government care, right. want people go back wage slavery. people say true. news cycle cover well enough Fauci others express concerns.

I appreciate LA story. follow state much (new friends family west) right, everyone. want to, could always try months bail hate it. Yeah true. Trump enables fools. prob means idea what's really happening RIGHT NOW. means individuals looking make informed decisions carrying status, can't. four fucking months testing delays still issue. abject failure.  Nailed Ted Cruz tool. first link article learned second link looked myself. bit scrolling find labs testing data. NCF Diagnostics lab one 88% positivity rate cumulative positive rate county fair, least US *recommends* federal level right? places enforced laws. 

Sweden none that. looks like Big Ed First possible likely China hide 99% numbers. that's problem government, citizens.

Second, say Trump well. 

The infection small one. Currently treated easily, back time curing method yet found, people still businesses would like come even got infected here. even investigated curing method prevention methods. Even common nickname home city, treat us differently. That's reason agree even naming location, necessarily mean would treat people origin virus differently. Guys can, unplug get rest lay bad news while....maybe try countering good news Covid survivor stories make out. 

Im gonna lie whole doomy thing media shelling like free candy sells.... going push punishment Cuomo too? Don’t hypocrite. One 10,000 reasons never intend set foot American plane long live. According Sweden lower per million death count Italy, although Spain listed (but I'm confident deaths).


I think obesity stat relevant though, extent. surprised. still way many people thinking earth flat. meme played straight IRL. Schools, important enough open right now, important enough fund properly. Name-calling intelligent. proud yet another nasty internet person. 5G drone? America indeed entire world, America actually crashes EVERYTHING crashes. PM'd Sad. Idk position... advices could give would lead escalation.

Love purpose. able think right. 

Stay safe best. investigation? wore one didn’t! didn’t...boom! Consequences! Remove office immediately (I wish.) deaths alone Sweden multiple times neighbours. Per million Sweden five times amount deaths Denmark, importantly Denmark test rate almost four times Sweden. 

If death rate accurate Covid metric coming Sweden stretch surmise compared Denmark greater testing regime many Swedes sustained covid health damage neighbouring countries. 

Rather Herd Immunity Sweden may created Herd Disability. happened several places control it. It’s play book. Next preparing crazy number graves anticipation filling them. lock try get handle negative consequences trying avoid early. ""The important cold viruses, checked immune system, settle permanently cells. Afterwards, bout poor health infection flue may unchain old colds flare guise new diseases""

Is true? Depends long post infection “immunity” lasts, reinfection may possible number months. Vaccines could issue booster shot required little 3 months. boot Ted Cruz flying them. gotta disagree here. flew couple trips last year like American way due baggage policy. American gave two free bags Delta made pay we're homeschooling fall Go shop somewhere else. can’t believe people working full time away home didn’t see bump pay. 

Because know vote going.

You would think Trump would want help average joe time like this, no... chooses keep fucking people would potentially vote him

Instead pay “essential” sacrificial lambs, chose fuck instead lead directly slaughter. 

Like many said current administration keeps shooting selves foot We're going disagree think view world country differently. militarization police budget 6 billion. policing black brown areas budget 6 billion. want know what's enough? 25 billion schools. money going? teachers still paying materials teach students. many reasons need defund police. country mess keep things way continue mess. problem this: care *their* grandma. could care less *your* grandma. Canada take Michigan? done parts Michigan, cool, like maple syrup eventually learn love pizza McDonalds  source recommendation ""mask worn"". Thank much. mean translated ""mortalitet"" ""excess mortality"" needed proof.  think it’s less standoffishness, average level education (not necessarily intelligence, education). 

The understand something, trust it. trust dog bark, sun shine, yellow jacket sting. 

Most us understand general science, trust speak, exhale droplets spit carry virus. Science showed us spread virus week two leading showing symptoms, trust *we person we’re speaking could already it, transmitting without knowing it*.

Most us understand it’s jab personal hygiene, matter trusting persons word. accept can’t really know (without getting tested daily completely isolating). 

That said, in-laws live across town continue invite us out, really understood, they’d stop inviting us. 

I think education carries lot us, social peer pressure carry rest. 

I’ve seen one person wearing mask indoors, honestly eyes glazed look them; guy either heavily medicated, playing full deck. Good luck that. inevitable people feel safer accept crowds everybody wears mask. get advocate city government employee. That's strictly rules. also part culture suffocating times - stay lane, job, put 8 hours go home. Every time step outside best intentions get head bitten off.

If friend works city government likely nothing schools. School districts bureaucratic nightmare; report state, individuals given district heavily influenced City politics. towns dominant forces local politics land developers, big-name lawyers course wealthiest people town, elected officials usually want run afoul them. Everyone passing buck downwards - fed passing states, states passing locals. School district superintendents pretty much ones left make calls right now, public health expert guarantee superintendents often *not* public health experts staff. may school nurses somewhere sideline. Local town politics become driving force decision across nation recipe disaster.   Eeek! Wishing health safe travels! says everyone wore mask everywhere 3 weeks would done with. can't call come together this? Instead we're going drag years hundreds thousands deaths instead? Ok sounds like plan! They're 2.5 4.5 mean pretty big deal Asia parts Europe iirc. US worry much it. Care share found expert perspective sharing? 

Because consensus I've seen actual epidemiologists initial lockdown saved thousands lives across country. People saw nothing panic business closures stay home orders significantly slowed spread virus. 

I understand purpose second point. What's wrong shaming selfish, petulant children? shamed. doxxed. lose jobs. Fuck them. There’s ban masks. People free use them. do. there’s restrictions saying use them. [Sent one It’s getting absurd levels idiocy. way we're going get stimulus money whole bunch people get sick. say bring on. Lol think need know qualify essential company. cannot life figure swinging ... children life long consequences die.

... potentially kill mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, etc.

I words describe feel power/anti-maskers/people taking seriously demonstrating modicum caution..... Also, people tend get tested day notice symptoms. takes days gets bad enough people say, ""maybe get tested."" happened concept electing best people serve political leaders? Nowadays, best people elected office, many people elected office absolute worst people USA.

People like Ted Cruz bottom rung American society - yet somehow asshole senator actually viable presidential campaign? American politics terminally sick praise, Sole Survivor!! There's always extremely loud collective sigh relief heard across Canada every time new extension announced. 

We build wall. booked tickets 2 months flight last week good faith would least attempt social distance middle seats. Fuck AA fuck wrong Republicans? Christ almighty. think schools mostly online protect professors forced campus students worry affecting grandparents long smart. Yes are. Mission Accomplished! /s I'm always looking comment, perfect, still beats comparing previous day. sounds right. problem take it? #""Face masks needed ordinary situations society""

Which, again, says [FMH 

This really sounds like according FHM, well: face masks needed aka recommended. Something wholly disagree something goes current international scientific consensus.

And yeah, c&amp;p'd g translate. Anyone else getting bored filthy rich people getting platform voice opinions topics dont expertise theyre rich Yep, booked flight months ago weren’t booking middle seats week flight emailed us saying they’re booking seats. Also, American stated multiple times flight you’d BANNED future flights didn’t wear mask whole flight. Ted Cruz fat wolverine ass hat  Honestly system fucked, don’t even know I’d call anything US “electing” anymore.... probable. *recalls South Park episode*


:-) usually suicides? ridiculous. thought US response pandemic get worse we're gonna restrict semblance factual information even more. ""Slow testing!"" said. Liar Chief continues well... lie. I'm positive move damage already atrocious pandemic response.  Hah busted 😂 I'm agreement (hate /s shit), logistically unworkable completely cold blooded entirely. live cancer survivor amount times I've read sentiments saying people like us never leave house selfish goblins avoid mask wearing blood boiling.   ""don't wear"" ""advice against"" said here. recommended worn ""in ordinary situations society"" recommended wearing either. certainly see difference saying ""Don't this"" ""Do this"" right? Send 'em *Pits Misery!* Thank already put order today moved germany chance Cell phone Internet even cheaper say here. get unlimited calls, texts 150gb data 9€/month, gigabit fiber Internet 15€/month. August we’ll European. Yeah, lung trauma occur ventilator. drs using ECMO treatments, massive surplus machines. I’m Swedish didn’t know “face mask” become dirty word here. They’re common, people wear don’t know anybody objects look upon do. mask works well would matter?  Philly resident I’ve really impressed city leadership handled this. Even though state technically allowed indoor dining bars 50% capacity city quickly pushed became clear significant vectors south. know spike Pittsburgh seeing attributed mainly bars. People happy stick hanging outside I’m interested see happens things get cold. Mask wearing good general well. 'overdose' grams. exaggeration bothers anything. profits!!! There's mask hand, ear, lap. appears one all.

He photographed gate wearing mask.

The picutre wearing mask different flight. Third wave. Wow. Wondering get first wave like 5 weeks. Hell, two weeks deaths reported person actually dies. Florida Texas still adding deaths May. right, bad. Karin Tegmark Wisell. According post said 'you need face masks close someone's face long time'. quite critical theorist. $$$$$$
Don’t hate, appreciate
Those top alway’s alway’s play different rules.
Laws rules I, ordinary people. New York surrounding states huge global outlier. Something really uniquely bad took place March April Northeastern United States - bad nursing home policy almost certainly contributed that, likely included factors too. Yes, oxfords cov1 vaccine changed slightly. Moderna though afaik. based platform cytomegalovirus vaccine pipeline while.


At end day though, vaccines essentially based previous proven methods. (the mRNA ones real exceptions ""platform"" approved humans yet) think you’re mistaking Texas Alabama [It Texas Governor sent 4,300 covid patients nursing homes? Thanks correcting guys defense simply stated presume fact. gave opinion matter slammed downvotes? would've made scene, SURE. assure you, US Healthcare workers got $1.25 hour raise would laughing meager shitting American Healthcare system caring workers that's give. world lost kind soul day. Troy get pizza? gotta real careful direct slightly nuanced takes sub I've learned. People quick trigger downvotes something fit status quo. ...Things knew February Talk bad publicity airlines too. Unbelievable let get away this. one, plan fly anywhere quite time. could research 

Claims presented without evidence dismissed without evidence. time people stopped parading around 65% link started linking one; though flipside, abstract say masks cracks effectiveness cut much 60%... 

I'm going talk specifics want doxx myself, work job see LOT people wearing masks, air leaks kind. reason i'm adamant ""masks protect much"" lot people care get it. ""justtheflu"" types. realize they're asymptomatic, come wear mask infect whole bunch people. Covid tendency pretty infectious early, mild stages. literally happened job work: employees forced wear masks, none customers did, bunch us got sick even though refused entry people coughing looked sick. Additionally, spread limited employees wore masks. isolated cases different departments. second masks mandatory everybody *entering*, stopped new cases amongst employees, even though area all-time peak active cases. 

I want people stop selfish wear masks right reasons. spite varying mask quality, get impression masks effectiveness halting transmission. basic understanding aerodynamics would back holes masks edges direct saturated airflow people might talking to. hand, holes sides masks conduct airflow infected people, stream follows path least resistance. 

I guess masks *do* protect bit, presenting evidence selfish good, though poke holes research examining poor quality masks. Pun intended. 

In case, thanks linking relevant study. took flight American last week made crystal clear wear mask entire flight, get booted banned flying American future Shit, Vodka better disinfectant. teachers Texas legitimately afraid dying, might well strike. 

What’s point retirement benefits people aren’t alive retire anyway. Florida breaking fatality record, today may first day see 1000 deaths one day since 6/9. He’s fucking terrible. epicenter global epidemic 30K+ died somehow measure excellence? One tip bored: get pet. like months, 2 weeks ago, got kitten. Haven’t much besides spending time him.

Edit: grammar Flight attendants probably punished guy jerkoff. Guess name ""zodiac killer"" gonna get whole lot bigger soon Don’t read much comment. 

Question - since masks effective preventing spread virus, view based data, schools re-open fully students teachers classroom, right? best incompetent leadership. 

One think 15 cases going magically disappear leading inadequate responses, encouraging hydroxychloroquine use, encouraging injecting disinfectant, strong arm states reopen early reopen schools Fall, want pack churches Easter, dismiss wearing mask. True, researching whistle-blower laws first would best guess 20 yr olds infected weeks back parents grandparents all. Appropriate username probably wear mask. sounds absurd American fair, looks like *one* private non-profit group instead entire school district board. Relevant typo ya got there. wow. keep ranting showing triggered. 

Fauci lied. admitted it. time vote No-Bama ""020 ! much less 0.02% people twenty. stay positive, batman! Makes sense though, Florida much better Hong Kong... oh, wait. real controversy. 

It fact deaths under-counted. know huge numbers excess deaths. I'd encourage make sweet bread like hokkaido milk bread treat!
But everyday bread can't overdose sugar, that's I'm talking about. Watching heartbreak/horror Australia here; insane - results came back maybe 18 hours tops. rest world gets waves, USA gets one almost year long mega tsunami 🌊 one called virus hoax, said medias coverage hoax. misrepresent facts, people stop listening you.

I convinced many wear masks find difficult misrepresent truth so.

It's hard

1. Acknowledge fair trust media 4 years pushing misinformation false narratives. 

2. Acknowledge like Trump fully see gotten raw deal media done nothing attack misinformation.

3. Acknowledge science gone back forth right science says wear masks, fuck knows future.

4. Acknowledge masks fucking suck, uncomfortable make feel silly wearing them.

5. talk wear mask tell shit them. wear fuck it, helps. wearing mask might get shit open sooner keep open it. talk cooler looking masks offer have

Shit works folks big egos cannot bring anything shame, unironically complain anti mask crowds ego guess everything bigger Texas, including death toll. much warning need? Reddit knew December, soooo either government willfully negligent really really bad jobs. Compared cotton cotton/polyester face masks, polyester face masks?  US free. Citizens spoiled, greedy. pandemic brought broken system light like nothing I’ve ever seen before. No. couldn’t think kinder word idiot. Sorry loss post gives meaning number deaths. Prior today covid normally third leading killer Florida, apparently going number one killer. fault DeSantis  I'd say true percentage ppl wearing masks closer 5-10% here. shopping downtown, likely frequent small boutiques stores made masks mandatory customers. Head Walmart Dominion see few. don’t travel, don’t go eat. basic shopping one day week, masks, mother, go lots walks. many walks. much else feel safe doing. Oddly enough, mother best friend trip Dells planned (before pandemic hit) July 7. Luckily, listened reason canceled it, worried. Yeah gets really bad even panic spreads, can't exactly drag people malls buy stuff want force eat out. infected exposed either visited work restaurants, stores, businesses, clubs, camps athletic teams well retirement community, officials said.

/s :| could've said Ronnie Donnie. flow. would think self-centered bastards would understand concept self preservation. state things mind boggling. That's niche awesome! supreme court overrule Gov.

Gov. wanting impose quarantine follow phases Wisc Supreme Court said fuck Gov. legal authority this. 

So Gov pressers say sorry Supreme Court told can't anything own. Anecdotal, flew Delta DFW Portland really well distancing. could low-demand route fill single middle seat. leg Salt Lake PDX like 20 passengers A220 Locals too! I'm seeing lot neighbors without lately places closed, specifically gyms. surprise get large public places (beaches) closed, again. Florida health officials Tuesday reported record 132 new coronavirus-related deaths among residents 9,100 new cases COVID-19.

The 132 deaths biggest single-day spike Florida seen since beginning pandemic, however mean people died past 24 hours.

Another 9,194 cases coronavirus brings statewide total 291,629. death toll 4,409. I've worn mask public months. Never gotten sick. Heavily hit state. Kiss kiss kiss bootie Entitled conservative scum Thank you! Who's taking care 5-year-old summer break? could hear chorus flatliners. He's talking actual grad school classes, moron. Don’t blame me, voted Beto. doubt, TV make big bucks anyway. think matter different data points. administration Federal State levels (where controlled GOP) actively working every health recommendation. 100% wrong, 100% time - that's due misinformation ineptitude, smacks deliberate attempt undermine health wellbeing every citizen possible. Exactly this. mask thing controversial - like contentious issues (abortion, gun control, immigration etc) people long held, deep seeded beliefs. bungled public health messaging early combined religious zeal pro mask brigade tainted well permanently. become another weapon cancel wars. FWIW ""pro mask"" even moreso anti public shaming solution anything. insane here, I've said since start, sub pushing fear far turn discredits everything. Wear mask, go crowded spots wash hands. stop pushing either die end ruined life. know plenty people recovered totally fine. really think virus flew around world matter weeks somehow would spare parts US action months end?

Yes, depending local characteristics like population density. know assume every locality going act similar NYC. states like South Dakota Iowa little government mitigation efforts explosion cases. Maybe eventually, still would fine months low mitigation efforts. Due population differences Arizona able compete Texas Florida sheer numbers comes cases per million people Arizona says, ""Hold beer!"" would nice!! extra pay Arizona RN large hospital, even though crisis situation told float covid floors, morgue manning entries hospital. They’re supposed get denied sick leave fall sick need take work, don’t know many people deter. Young people ones getting infected many college.

Why getting downvoted this? I’m literally stating policy ffs.  Oregon? weird, schools phased reopenings Netherlands since may, really seen uptick since. wonder difference is. Unpopular opinion: probably drastically over-count flu deaths. 

We apparently extrapolate assumed deaths based many factors assume legitimate, that's way attain accuracy. 

It's type loose methodology allows credited magazines assert half mankind point died malaria. Citations please.

Haha think bit stretch saying florida going clear 3-4 weeks. Also, flattening 3k cases per day still issue... serious I'll start looking later week. Thank much advice. [San Francisco proper seroprevalence high accuracy high specificity test detects neutralizing antibodies, simply molecular components compose them. found seroprevalence much, much lower reports two orders findings contrast community-based studies reported higher rates seropositivity California, underscore importance using highly accurate test surveillance studies low-prevalence populations. 

I'd argue even higher prevalence populations, tests report positive result commonly acquired antibodies (such produced infection common cold), tests still worthless surveillance. enemies across globe know focus on. 

I'm sure saw spread uncontrollably everywhere else too. least philly receivers safe.  Trump said yesterday already done best shutting down, minimizing deaths, helping states, giving ventilators, going open everything back up. Now...YOU OwN! Parents too. states social benefit system Sweden heavily relied make sure people need go work sick, parents take care symptomatic children (even symptoms, allowed schools), people access health care worry going bankrupt. think pretty important points trying implement Sweden work places people safety net.

P.S. Also Sweden imposed lot measures social distancing, Florida made sure attending religious services considered ""essential business"" even multiple countries reporting large outbreaks linked exactly church gatherings. However many people get tested heck exposure situation get tested anyways. Also lots hospitals test procedures people get positive results inadvertently. see point. think anyone big city take chance. point government mandate take burden businesses. people focusing flying using public restroom larger risk, see people fleeing those. “We’re getting kids house back school even kills us”

\- Donald Trump, except written stupid. Good news everyone! got ten cent raise 

^^^^but ^^^^if ^^^^you ^^^^strike ^^^^you ^^^^forfeit ^^^^your ^^^^retirement.

But hey, 10 CENTS! there's big difference thinking Covid-19 spread protests, thinking protests worth despite risk. know fall latter train thought.

and march went actually really good social distancing. police shut roads us could spread walking Capitol. combined outside, surprised spread day. AA headquartered DFW. way they'll anything. Also they're terrible fucking company. deserve fail. investors would left penniless. fine, playoffs see Russell Westbrook passing covid anyone else. He'll probably hold onto airball 3 point line crunch time. owners want limited capacity Plus time initial cases spread, exponential growth powerful. 


If 10,000 people caught specifically 4th July there's R0 2, means 3-4 weeks later we'll see another 20,000 new cases single day, another 3-4 weeks another 40,000 etc.... Ahh, typical American hypocrisy. care anything benefit you. ""I hate greedy corporations, care benefits me."" Sorry smart enough research go better things get business degree. 7 day average 60,000 cases, Elementary school math 30 days month (I know) 60,000 x 30 = 1,800,000 (1.8 million) x 1% death rate = 18,000 deaths month. sad people power okay number want children infected go back school. guess killing seniors good enough want children dear. Republicans morals.  wonder never notice tourists entitled, obnoxious willfully ignorant. Safest choice driving, probably train open windows flight. USA never shut down.  I’m Christian believe God Jesus. think misunderstanding Christianity is. quite sad present day church failing present Jesus came proclaim. gospel never “good” people. bible tells us bad people single one us good. I’m sure recognize deep since told lies point lives know dirty thoughts. God despises thoughts actions, Christians refer sin. God perfect holy, cannot stand sin. God also perfectly just, cannot forgive us without penalty. left alone would die, punishment sin death. However, God also perfectly love. sent son Jesus Christ earth human live perfect life he, deserve die, takes penalty death, believe Jesus forgiven sins. praise God. done something us never could. matter hard try, cannot good.

With regards perception God angry, vengeful, cruel. suppose much evil suffering world? However, question know something objectively evil? defines this? somebody God, God agree definition? Therefore, cannot blame God evil subjectively defined, without God, cannot define objective good evil. shall also argue suffering always bad thing (Christians called suffer directly bible), I’ll let look curious. Suffering also result sin (I.e. cheat/steal/lie, somebody gets hurt), God want. argue stop it, end “which better governing system” debate (dictatorship vs anarchy, control vs freedom).

With regards point Christians scientific rational, agree many Christians simply believe without really questioning understanding believe. must say, one Christians another believer came questioned faith. Since then, I’ve searched arguments God’s existence scientific philosophical fields. questions ponder ones like this: God doesn’t exist, world come exist? world works cause effect, must cause start world, leads conclusion God must made it. may object, God require also beginning? answer no, God material operate laws world (since he’s one made laws haha). second objection world lasts forever start end? actually opposed science. I’ll leave look argument posed second law thermodynamics. objections I’m unaware of, want know. Either way, point Christianity require throw logic common sense window. Another food thought question want pose science explains everything, explains science?

My hope shed light Christians actually believe rational believe believe. Don’t feel bad fault unaware Christianity is. Rather, quite shame church today fails present God truly offers. Feel free reply curious learn more. Well kills hockey season philly fall dog health bill affordable human health bill. Wtf going here?  Lots people called Coronavirus hoax. think mean President directly said ""the Coronavirus hoax.""

However, belief Coronavirus worse flu, media exaggerating seriousness, similar claims proliferated conservative media ambiguous statements, President never come said words effect ""COVID-19 really dangerous need take every precaution slow spread,"" really bare minimum federal leadership issue. get math, think good argument less dire proposing. recoveries occur confirmed cases early on, lot people went untested, thus lot recoveries missed. think recovery ratio might end lot higher currently appears. However, also recognize counterargument missed deaths well could skew numbers way. hard gauge. Regardless, deaths rise. hoping isn’t drastic, takes wrong population group become infected things really become morbid. taken two pups get groomed. groomer picks dog car wore mask. would assume it’s fairly safe long you’re waiting inside facility. guarantee purchased coffee could ""I wear mask drinking beverage"" excuse stunt would expect immature pre-teen one step removed ""stop hitting yourself.""

Hopefully newfound facial hair trick Texans thinking he's strong man's man. hope Texans send weak slimeball packing. Literally Google term 'coronavirus immunity' right see recent results tell you.

It indeed 'speculation' like suggest, random speculation. opinion scientists carried studies. interesting dude worth time Nah care. ""Everyone"" problem, though. live Bizarro world. politicians looking COVID short term thing... ""OK, cases down, open everything"" ... ""oops, cases going up, let's pull back bit"" ... ""Oh, schools? spend time money accommodate? Pffft, kids fine"" rolling average rising. looking single days tell anything. yeah, states clear weekend hospitalization undercount effect TX AZ before. overall rate increase seem slowed last week, though may partially sending patients home better conditions would kept hospital. may closing bars flattening curves bit... COVID19 cause blue toes. I’m gonna disagree this. Trump commander chief. Top officials may resign protest, trump authority dictate what’s military’s best interest. one else. Supreme Court definitely back moves makes comes authority commander chief  hope do. mean graduated college 2013 I’ve never started school Labor Day, didn’t realize wasn’t norm. also proposed open carry paint ball guns. never cared grandma ever. really expect start now? airline refused protect passengers? partial rainbow spectrum “Curiosity beginning” maybe r/SuddenlyGay thing ever.

At time I’m sitting studying get skills work anywhere country starting salary ranges anywhere 40k-60k.

American Airlines stated investigating incident, ...

My guess they're finding low level, criminally underpaid employee fire score cheap points changing literally nothing enforcement mask policy. Well, mean, they'll enforce without fail, course.

They're waiting blow over. 16% probably enough push R 1, need see decrease daily infections. helps, works conjunction behavioral changes. R0 3 behavioral changes drop R 60%, still get exponential spread naive (0 immunity) population, R would still 1 (at 1.2). 16% infected, would see 30% reduction R immunity, pushing 1 (to 0.8). 

The difference daily infections change significantly, even small number immune people. example above, starting 1000 infections per day, end 1 month 3000 infections per day naive population 250 infections per day population 15% immunity. second group really claim right things first group failing job? really viruses work. couple things make implausible. 


1. Viruses really dormant phase. alive traditional sense. essentially genetic material envelope. would essentially difference dormant virus non dormant virus. confused latent phase virus. infection cells happened replication currently happening.


2. Coronaviruses new. suddenly discover February. SARS MERS caused Coronaviruses. 


What thinking stuff like clostridium family bacteria. stuff around us time dormant spores environmental changes cause activate.


Coronavirus really mystery exact vector known. know reasonably well come animal reservoirs. truth idea killer germ exists frozen deep ice lying wait little paranoid fantasy. truth really deadly pathogens everywhere world many* know sometimes change. replication goes wrong way causing mutation. That's seen particular sickness before. mysterious new face old enemy.

Fun fact know Detroit north Canada?? still blows mind. think multiple people deepfaked footage Ted Cruz wearing mask airport flight coordinated release said video multiple social media platforms established accounts? Texas - ""hold bear"" kidding? Unions south? even know anyone union moved away. Workers south treated like garbage. Disposable, especially service workers.

The side coin culture ""southern hospitality"" means lot expected providing service, usually thanklessly. hmmmm seem apply private property moment, certainly setting precedent gets worse. necessarily say mixed messaging, would say thinly veiled threat. Probably one think. 

A single state’s single day death number likely lot less important current past mistakes made media subreddits like this.

Initially, plan use hospital ships handle non-COVID stuff like car accidents keep load main hospitals, [it turned nearly (testing quick enough). Ships also great COVID infection control (as USS Theodore Roosevelt demonstrated) narrow, confined announcement Comfort take New York’s worst coronavirus cases represents stark about-face **the Navy, warned recently Friday Comfort “not configured provide treatment infectious diseases.”** Mercy, sent Los Angeles, asked take coronavirus patients, according Navy officials. blm protests took virus seriously. haircut karens didn't.

Haha. can’t wait see results “investigation” That’s hilarious. cant fire whole faculty... 15-20% population infected NYC hard-hit areas, absolute highest end estimates, must explanation decrease case numbers, hospitalizations deaths.

The answer masks work nearly everyone wears them, people generally maintaining social distancing, certain types businesses re-open (retail shopping outdoor dining okay / indoor dining, movie theaters bars okay). fact made Phase 3 re-opening without spike new cases accomplishment involved listening science.

If opened bars millennials bored cabin-fever “bartenders gotta eat,” we’d living different reality. Sweden expanded.

Deaths suffering aside.... Exposure matter. might take 7 hours become infected, long term exposure increases probability infection. walk somebody, probability infection low. spend one hour together person room, probability infected greater.

See CDC guidelines information: Factors consider defining close contact include proximity, duration exposure (e.g., longer exposure time likely increases exposure risk), whether exposure person symptoms (e.g., coughing likely increases exposure Data insufficient precisely define duration time constitutes prolonged exposure. Recommendations vary length time exposure, 15 minutes close exposure used operational definition. Brief interactions less likely result transmission; however, symptoms type interaction (e.g., infected person cough directly face exposed individual) remain important.

This makes 30 minute shop home depot relatively safe, sitting room students teachers day relatively unsafe. Especially taking consideration aerosol transmission, class room setup seems like perfect super spreader setup.

Veterinarian academic hospital. remote learning fourth year students it’s rough. try stream case workups, wifi sketchy, emergencies don’t always free hands (and we’re much way elective cases). made virtual case modules students...so went dozens cases, pulled MR’s assembled history, case progressions, diagnostics, etc. choose adventure workup help.

Then also ton rounds topics weren’t seeing much regular stuff. Huge amount work. 

And get students turn cameras mics chat roommates, zoom they’re walking dog park. it’s frustrating students really interested, aren’t getting hands-on experience. 

It’s definitely super fun experience us, either. per capita cases far highest world. 1% Americans caught Covid-19 point.

Is true? Worldometers shows 9th cases per capita (if take microstates like Andorra, San Marino Vatican City). valid question honestly doesnt matter since they're people puts risk. cases go couple weeks swing gates wide open again. quite obvious picture removing mask that's worn hours. judgmental prick. real crime, think, beard. state Maryland. recently reversed. fit antibody tests. 24% NYC came positive, 12% state overall. bringing control. That's natural way epidemic.
We could done literally nothing curve would gone even earlier, flattened curve health care system overrun. Nahhhhh opening dodnt protests!!! (/s)

Nahhhh liberal HOAX. reblublican state trying take down!! (/s)

Nahhhh flu!! (/s)

Should continue? severe patient country (Vietnam), pilot came Scotland little rest. I'm glad Scotland safe place now. don’t think we’re good job. would suck me...I live border basically like city across border city foreshadowing next month open schools scam. Covers everything issue claiming for. Texas finally took measures? Ironically UK, North wall safest place right key shotgunning tilting head back much possible keep throat wide open beer goes effort. great practice getting intubated. Facebook social media then. tons people claiming BLM protests spread Corona virus. statement infuriating uninformed claim masks cause health problems. Ok get Oh absolutely! mean - maybe clear early woke wrote yeah. certain level rich, really matter happens everyone else bad things get hoi polloi. stay rich. 

But work living - even earn high wage labor - risk. example: member extended family cosmetic surgeon. made fantastic living covid, nose jobs tit jobs. he's virus hot spot. People scared voluntary surgeries. income cut 50%. Ultimately he'll ok he's gotten message: benefit tax cuts outweigh downsides global pandemic.

But guys private equity firm LLC owns building plastic surgeon practice? 

Those guys probably gotten message. rather, gotten different message, find way make money matter -even global pandemic.  I, pfblockerng firewall ublock origin browser Easier cut life, then. 😂 likely ? odds ?   would surprised actually terms conditions ban; assuming gets banned. See that’s prevent second wave... young guy (early 30s iirc) went Covid party died think last week San Antonio. Apparently said someone hospital (not sure nurse doctor someone else) something effect “I thought hoax, I’ve made serious mistake” long died. Yes, happened country well. Traffic deaths previous years... Lockdown 4 evah!  Cuomo said briefing yesterday uptick cases ended traced back people visited upstate, Georgia. also said although numbers steady, fact compliance social distancing mask wearing starting decrease statewide troubling easily cause infection rate jump back REAL quick places like NYC, Long Island, Westchester area. Wow, go frat heavy school think know single one who's becoming doctor. 

Like, 90% majoring business. I'm saying frats bad, that's experience

Interesting you, though.  No. thing make real Biden wins. every death every case evidence impeachment. Swine flu notable seemed hit younger people much harder older. ALOT children young adults died swine flu. decision needs hands business point. we’re smart enough 140k dead bodies, million won’t change anything. cannot tell worse, pandemic stupidity pandemic selfishness. Either way, killed many people already go. problem America. care affect me, care. guy behind acting like used gets out. mean?  I’ve gotten point family. you’re going say stupid shit front kids, you’ve opened corrections front kids. would save lives coronavirus could kill... basically US, Brazil India holding torch. rest world play whack mole got vaccine burns out. 3 continue beat brains mallet. 

Like course american news source wants divert attention Germany.. lol. COVID patients require weeks convalescent care; tying bed swamped hospital good hospitals filling up.

So placing among vulnerable population alternative? seem smart. he’s zodiac killer, dad killed jfk Totally normal need refrigerator trucks hospitals insane, state Tennessee roughly population Arizona can't imagine 90+ deaths day, although seem heading way. flipao xd ever catch it, would sure classified. may already gotten it, knows ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Perhaps even play not. every team. love masks slowly surely becoming mandatory everywhere. can't stand guy, clearly holding coffee cup. Presumably may sips photo? wish way me. sent email explicit saying 'your contract paused, continue soon open'. Please post 100 times./s CDC never said it’s possible reinfected, haven’t ruled out. literally officially designated pandemic.

Pandemic word thrown around casually, claim designated pandemic, long? actually looked evidence found nothing official classification HIV/AIDS pandemic major health organization like CDC World Health Organization.

[This says CDC actually declared 2 pandemics prior current COVID-19 pandemic. [Here's best paper I've read CDC's considerations classifying pandemic starts regional epidemics, especially Sub-Saharan Africa, cluster new disease spread. disease spreads fluid-to-fluid contact, spread like respiratory virus logarithmic growth. HIV/AIDS pandemic specifically mean important virus study try cure, justify calling pandemic.

I find multiple headlines calling ""HIV Pandemic"" without backing properly. Like literally place ""pandemic"" written headline, ""pandemic"" ""epidemic"" interchangeable terms. surprise me, titles news articles often written Editor, know details writer, motivated write impactful (exaggerated) headline get attention.

This succinct distinction I've read, good article disease outbreaks whether classified [pandemics vs assume pandemic everyone potentially exposed,"" says Dr. Andres Romero, infectious disease specialist Providence Saint John's Health Center Santa Monica, California. FYI: Idaho lot Mormons, hold many leadership positions.

In fact, debating evolution climate change science standards, one legislator stated humans coexisted dinosaurs, another said buy brontosaurus meat online. 

So there's that. I’m mostly imagining tantrums told can’t take off. children can’t catch it, remember? pretty true. work drug discovery personally cured mice diabetes cancer. drugs really work humans. ""These hospitalized patients, cases, therefore pattern journalists misleading clicks means entire thing overblown hoak make Trump look bad election year. Checkmate doomers.""  Nah want hassle bunch white people all. Cops hassle folks time rhymes dubididy Anti-vaxers impressed this...  It’s free sovereign debt bro Yea everyone already died Sweden currently tests Finland Norway less Denmark. think want know herd immunity numbers troll post history. essential worker work entire pandemic Health Clinic, thank anger concern. appreciated.

No pay raise, ""Hero Pay"", anything. Except $100 gift card local restaurant. Lol previous generations could go 6 years brutal war. people survive year virus. Man people pathetic days can't go months ""done"". US done tests? That's really think Pre-pandemic look like Walmart version Wolverine. It’s goalpost moving minute antibody duration shown shaky, familiar vocal crowd hopped t-cell train.

We don’t know anything yet.

Maintain social distance, wear mask, increase testing capacity, cooperate contact tracers. Oh stay home (if can) especially hotspots.

That’s know works Ok. Assuming hospitalization rate around 10% patients means around 5% patients (55% hospitalized patients) show heart abnormalities. may 55% still relatively high scary af. Imagine president kind grammar! Tremendous amounts Lysol probably less testing think pretty clear yesterday replied exact post: ; want participate pandemolympics bad thing? countries following paths post updates news Sweden - positive negative seen record. happy positive ones recently, sometimes difficult notice subreddit feeds controversial headlines.  ""promote discredited Swedish model"" - promotion, country already chosen strategy tactic. Nobody government reading posts trying convince people countries country needs change. posting situation happens country.

Nothing changed position. information Sweden's neighbours, Sweden's development. [It's opinion, mention, Covid first identified mid-November city Wuhan. Simply due nature international travel finance, guarantee person covid know NYC 2019 over. 

Other isolated states seeing spikes like AZ Idaho almost six full months behind first community outbreak NYC is. contagious flu.

The virus intensity seem much worst flu(maybe tad) makes much worse contagious is, also resilient, flu season typical done northern hemisphere now. seen peer-reviewed research linking outdoor protests (or really major outdoor events) surge Texas,” said Rodney Rohde, PhD, associate dean research Texas State’s College Health Professions focuses public health one first states start reopening — including indoor facilities bars movie theaters. surge COVID-19 cases recent weeks led reimposition lockdown measures requirement regions wear face masks COVID-19 spike Texas likely tied reopening, protests, Rohde look time frame post-protests regarding case counts, hospitalizations, mortality see may correlation. seen observations,” Rohde told Healthline.

Super-spreader events major outbreaks been, virtually without exception, indoors. think getting together huge crowds shouting necessarily brilliant behavior middle public health crisis, data anywhere linking case surges protests. unsurprising, given took place outdoors. vote mail DE, couldn't, I'd right you. nothing short death going stop voting Trump office. assume ""agreed"" means asked Whitehouse babysitters make sure throw hissy fit start tarriff maple syrup petty shit. current one, paging u/DrRobRedfield... People asking question Germany comparing number Italy. Basically comes to:

1. testing looser testing criteria Germany (FL) vs. Italy (NY).
2. Younger crowd hit Germany (FL) vs. Italy (NY).
3. Better knowledge treatments Germany (FL) vs. Italy (NY).
4. factor considered time. ***Germany faced deaths article***, Italy side pandemic curve. 

Florida likely see thing, things likely get lot worse, catastrophic New York reasons above. Florida take solace death rate low 3 4 cases past month. sound like nature asshole office holder would simple giving damn anyone himself, guy needs removed office kills someone based stupidity... Remember 2 confirmed cases US said top get worse that? We've ""good news"" like since March. None came fruition. Even people stop dying, things return normal considering deaths shit still hitting fan. I've lost hope future. even politicians encouraging mass protests breath feigning concern increases cases. New Yorkers maintain league table drunk tourists balconing deaths? would they? Americans leave compared nations, expats relatively rare Europe. South American refugees going immigrate US. Idahot potatoe four provinces majority country. contain population dense cities. surrounded morons  me, wearing different shirt two photos? Look color shirt, top button. Sadly new information makes double “look wrong scientists were!!” continue decry everything fauci says wrong didn’t recommend masks March. Looks like parents pushing safety measures ignored board voted (with 70% favor) opening WITHOUT masks social distancing. Time new board. Everyone cable pays phillies regardless watch not. Good things eagles still allowed Ranked Choice Voting would certainly help emergence third party, better candidate election. Yeah, comment history alone means I'm gonna respond you. want say ""science based"" go ""tHiS KiLl kiDs"" rant. 

Funnily enough, even right (you're not), pediatricians still recommend parents take precautions things similarly low death rates among children, including vaccinating diseases practically longer exist. least, burgeoning pandemic disease world never seen before, expect doctors honest parents say ""we know could happen kids exposure, outcomes could really bad. Sending back school complicated choice obviously less risk better."" Thoughts well, don’t forget those... I've saying since March. Fauci coward enabling Trumps lunacy passive. time hurricane season Cause there's enough testing test everyone shit hits fan? Think. trust administration tell what's "" safe"" ways currently failing? Alright made one typo 2am, need pedantic cunt :) don’t go OC, seems like good idea there’s people like Non-invasive ventilators used, people know ventilator is, claim non-invasive vents actually ventilators.

The CDC put PSA showing people like ventilator encourage people wear masks.  Like said, Show rates infection like arizona, texas florida?? U cant haven’t spiked like states. cause spreading nothing like states. U need wait 7 hours get tested Florida arizona. states suffering opened early blm. Don’t believe see eyes.

Now heard before... big player like President United States? Secretary Education? city pay ANYTHING city safe? obviously young memories NYC 80s. Sad. sure point. b lot doppelgangers I'm done investigation. trying kill wife ugly. Ask bunker Don. Eh, really much better off.

More masks shit people wear them. Testing adequate actually willing commit lockdown proper re-opening cases control, testing band-aid bullet wound. maybe another news sperm whale plasma blood potential increasing libido human cure covid faster original drug wonder doctors would benefit damaging economy. would interested that? Makes sense Chuck! claimed said something different telling here. Sephiroth 2020 People behave like that. students strike? schools need attendance order get funding students hold power organize live hour border Minnesota, every Molson crack open lake guys common knowledge people choose educate themselves, masses thinking masks save them. Exactly, especially everything shaky for...well, speak life, entered job force 2012, 2016, never known stability, even ""good"" jobs. Like say - freedom, fear. Constant fear worry. must behind news... know something? again, I'm arguing predatory practices need fixed I'll first say America short term gains long term prosperity, statistically, 78% Americans living paycheck paycheck. number accounts people making $50k well. comes lot living within means.

You put blame corporations mortgage industry want, numbers reflect statistics. corona virus keeping people working, enhanced unemployment benefits. really need say that? Problem like 3M N95 masks probably fit huge honker. Huh, thought Orange County Florida u til read comment. dumb, stupid dumb? Huh? think so? Maybe? knows. example income show whole picture. people expenses child support, alimony, etc? may make $100k/year bring home less someone makes $75k/year. I'm assuming get anything I'll surprised come tax time. Sorry I'm misunderstanding, comment thread seemed advocating still campus. point apologize. *we're* saying still campus point even classes online still mandatory staff could/would impacted. Ted Cruz could also help situation putting mask on, traveling make talk show appearances. toward end month, we’ll seeing get bit comfortable place,” said.

I see expect wave crest. either implement strict lockdowns, populous adopts masks, see slowing much. Willful negligence causing thousands die. deserves prison. I'm sure anything gain financially making proclamation. I'm point wishing ill deniers. way ends die off. viral load mask reduces load still much better mask-less. Sure Canadians American film production i'm talking American actors come Canada work. Unfortunately, yes. population completely homogeneous, minorities type suffer actions majority. That's nature democratic system.

I would advise democrat voters states GTFO fast can, sakes. They're safe there, multiple reasons. I’m triggered doesn’t bother Fauci changed guidance. It’s unfortunate many people US selfish stupid (toilet paper?) lied to. mean people still refusing wear masks reason. 

You’re one spouting propaganda fake news. clear trump continues lie way Fauci ever people died. Shit, that's morbid. cancer / heart disease number state kind ""oh shit"" moment state. mean react much sooner becomes daily killer really take notice like taking advantage situation. best bet USA situation, would use opportunity stand rest competitors knees. Let guess, COVID thing going problem you, unless personally catch it, right?

You anything (like wear mask) protect anyone around you, correct?

Children becoming permanently damaged issue kids?

It's Hoax Dems?

The simple fact look numbers US VS rest world, see hoax perpetrated Donald Trump ENTIRE PLANET **including enemies**, get re-elected, says everything anyone would ever need know you. astoundingly ignorant everything around willingly throw away hundreds thousands American lives, including families, exactly? economy? Well economy recover without action you, government.

If honestly believe entire planet fucking US elections, kind trick. Even though 7,500,000,000 maybe 500,000,000 world wide actually care US enough even care exist problem you? 7.5 BILLION human beings, legitimately believe us it. believe nothing outside US actually exists yourself? know what? Let infect other. They’ve acted like Karens wearing fucking mask keeping people safe months. I’m sick told lives loved ones don’t matter. go hell. empathy unfortunate enough get assholes, them? Let infect other. correct this, fair comparison. suppose look Italy, cases thousands hundreds, due diligence masking distancing. Granted United States won’t address Jan. 2021 depending year’s presidential/congressional/senate elections, hearsay. can’t speak countries!

U.S. constituents calling higher taxes rich years; witness tax write offs/cuts called socialists even pondering that.

After 2008, lost complete faith help average Americans midst economic turmoil. Shocker, they’ve sucking other’s long necks years, break traditions. I've looked all-cause mortality Peru, testing catching 25% excess deaths. I'm saying position important grand scheme things, guy surprised position tangibly benefit economy, seeing steady stream funding said economy. try preach importance environment want, change fact conservation sustainable career, everyone goes field well aware that. breathing exercises. really help.

I'm 5 months still feeling quite myself, definitely good enough hike. Unfortunately, beat corona staying inside.  Get sun lots exercise, preferably far away everyone. I've made point 2-3 miles (minimum) per day, moreso help stress, also foot (that re-broke corona), definitely helps fitness. I'd run, rheumatoid arthritis. Strangely biking (doesn't hurt knees/ankles, hurts back worst is).

I 5 autoimmune diseases immunosuppressant well. I'm taking chances. Ironically, far less concerned 10,000 feet topped out. figured nobody it. still wore mask stayed far away people :) literally digging still seem right. would rather wrong though. feel ya, work hotel recent hot spots Sask got worrying. got this, prairie strong 💪 car blacked windows driving hundred miles hour Alcohol numbs pain caused receiving healthcare can't afford. 'Men less likely make hospital trip women'? Providing fact, proves main reason men die virus fault?

Misandry darned subtle thing, thing. Parks open state. spent hour sculpture garden park weekend great experience.

My amazing local bar also delivering mixers porch Friday. add shot gin enjoy delicious beverage, bonus wearing pajamas access Netflix. Sorry hear bad experiences professors.

Many us unhappy situation students are. Decisions affect entire university often made administrators, limited power counteract them. article doesn’t seem say it’s confirmed related protest. primarily seem saying due breaches lockdown housing towers. protesters tested positive, least one positive protest, others aren’t linking definitively it. It’s unclear protests much risk. experience protestors wear masks protests outdoors. Though I’m sure varies state. Like wouldn’t go protest hotspot state. mean would avoid contact others much possible states regardless.

I’ve two local protests reports saw cases related protests. It’s several weeks since went them. It’s several weeks, going happen happened now. Basically? evidence weather explanation speculating? also believe weather big affect found evidence sole explanation. understand virus us whole time. plan live like whole life? whole situation really makes wish majority tax dollars would go local government. correct. ECMO proven effective ventilator. It’s even invasive...but saves life it’s worth it. Saddest part drastically fewer ECMO machines ventilators. It’s impossible argue change mind somebody doesn’t believe facts evidence. It’s exactly like arguing somebody believes current pandemic hoax. doesn’t matter many facts reputable sources throw them, believe they’re fake made up. anti-vax. honestly believe way people learn personally negatively affect them. know stupid is? mean, seriously saying believe it, know stupid intentionally making shit based political motivation? could eat asshole Satan mask on, fool? Oh Christ 🤦🏽‍♀️ Hmm maybe america something slam dicks reopening early bear trap repeating:

#Face masks needed ordinary situations society followed ""...where apology suckas?..."" couldn’t. put credit still haven’t got single dollar unemployment four months. Mannn course, can't read article, fact someone talking sort implies part problem. person scientist, irony indeed palpable warned report showed Orlando Health 98 percent positivity rate. However, FOX 35 News contacted hospital, confirmed errors report. Orlando Health's positivity rate is only 9.4 percent, 98 percent as report

I wish article addressed happened. Mask face shields DONT SHIT people ages race keep touching FUCKING MASKS FACES TIME. America anti-science culture funded promoted years fossil fuel industry Republican party cynical rea$on$. we're seeing end result decades-long effort convince Americans scientists either know talking actively lying. science denial spread way beyond original intended targets climate change evolution. people fed 40-year diet anti-science propaganda believe western medicine, germ theory, vaccination either. Hopefully it’s state state basis. I’m New York [our governor least plan can’t imagine opening state cases spiking though. Diseases found could cured pretty big 50s well makes perfect sense public education. Everything Imperial divisible 2, 3, 4, easy visually head. measures based common units easy estimate within 5%, useful potter making bunch clay ""cups"" ""pints"".

Once public education, literacy, precise enough tooling measure grams, Metric makes sense almost every case (I still think Farenheit better measuring weather, 100 ""fucking hot"" 0 ""fucking cold"", would sacrifice everything *else* Metric). matter systems designed different things. Imperial meant function large margin error, Metric designed precision mind. can't say ''everyone, except'' because? Anecdotal, people I've spoken said pay actually cut. guys lifeline many industries. ones transporting medical supplies beginning, NE getting hit hard. said better solution, offered one Everything, gyms, opened people act everything over. lot aren’t wearing masks, even many wear stores get together family friends though it’s 2019 precautions place. doubt requirement masks go away time soon. difference saying masks work forcing ppl wear them. countries situation uk regards shortage masks. still made wearing recommendation much earlier. Like Austria example.

The medical supply industry powerful Lobby. underestimate level evil.

Someone getting rich this. doubt it.

I personally wear wether need not, that’s got fact like anonymous much preventing CV19.

I hope becomes normal like Asia. risk that, Katrina. Texas tried ""We going keep teaching!"" time federal lawsuit Texas get b-slap courts needed years now. Yet people contact tracing, conspiracy theorist confusing. told so? study saying 90% say so? think even 5% believes that. covid spreads always environments absolutely know it. However, MUCH LESS PROBABILITY setting outside (and wear mask) . Everybody knows covid spread. take people right protest much much bigger issue. one took right protest anti mask morons ARs necks. one taking right BLM. Gyms pretty much ruined reputation credit reporting agencies though chances stop payments can’t anything it. 

They probably never got social security number begin with.

They try bluff things power enforce. giant mistake, CDC, properly used, great minds behind actually competent.

This bureaucracy working undermine make quick dollar. Americans need aware CDC fault what's happening. ignored sabotaged science deniers government. fact even need say disgraceful.

And there's believe Amazon would stand behind statement. Deaths began climb July 4th already, two weeks cases began vertiginous climb mid-June. Number cases going 
Good news Yes that's said colleges online. people watching states show support you? I'm willing call write multiple people anything else power. may sound morbid wish they'd PSAs showing real icus people ventilators. 

I realise likely still change idiots minds think would make idiocy harder spread. talking human beings, first mistake expecting rational behavior. Well name county Misfortune, honestly surprised.  Noone could care less people wearing masks part sweden. No, didn’t shut *entire* world. many places America refused shut down. Yup. know tomorrow 16.1999998, DeSlantis like, ""Whoo-hoo! 'Rona's DEEcline, ya sweaty mofos."" point one thing out?

Millions people unemployed, risk belongings thrown streets missing rent, mortgage, etc.

We asking people suffer manner help healthcare system, expensive world, manage paltry, I'll prepared inventory ventilators, PPE, staff resources.

I cant help think fucked healthcare system woefully mismanaged preparations.

But could predict this? call BS question. predict. Scientists public health experts ringing alarms decades. plenty scares... SARS, Zika, Swine Flu, Ebola..like know bad things get bad exotic pathogen jumps new host.

So question is, can't find enough work pay bills (that keep coming), get bill healthcare system helping deal abysmal mismanagement?

If shit street, shouldnt CFOs CEOs hospital systems also thrown out? Who's ultimately responsible enough ventilators knew coming?

And happens again? Wonder bots move ""Muh Nursing Home"" deflection. Like that's REALLY focus on, that's really ammo have, maybe he's better job thought. could name least 5 Republican governors top head much worse job terms decision making leadership. numbers show it. Exactly! might well killed all... Hope get well soon! selfish! Wear mask! People getting fined boating alone near beach protest. politicians health authorities made 180 protest suddenly ""safe"" pack 1000s people close together shouting chanting. Mask replacement social distancing know.

Yeah, people angry blame protest reason. Uptick cases young people states protest 3-4 weeks protest ""we cannot link cases protest"" . BS. Different breads rise differently, quick rise breads different flavor texture long ferment breads.
Quick rise whole wheat bread often uses form sugar help rising process. 
Long rise breads necessarily better, deeper flavor often require less sugar.

A little 1/4 cup sugar added yeast beginning typical many whole wheat recipes ferment long time. Don’t count chickens they’ve hatched 💀 someone ever haircut like that, assume dumbest person room. least 4 Everyone wearing masks... nose... thanks. I'm still staying home. Yeah. We’re 250 three states - FL, AZ, AL trifle many .01 percent dont even manage investments 

They work momentum...

If parents owned ton real estate California decades ago help rich today example

Most crowd fall flat try manage investment..or..to paraphrase..

Makine million nothing work...

Making 2 billion 1 billion inevitable necessarily true.

Yes money stock market still loss right now. 

You (not wealthy person) sharing anecdotal experience nothing I’m also (luckily) situation money sit while.

Irrelevant comment depends invest money participate day trading. 

No wealthy person day trading unless fun, hire people manage massive portfolios day trading skills still making money.

The market trending middle pandemic nothing day trading

Honestly based comment,You don’t know anything stock market take money put IRA you’re hurting confusion Florida fire... footnote testing delayed yesterday testing delays 2 weeks. US international students allowed take 1 online course, change school sueing Trump? also one soon I'm scared hell going back country idea live anymore Yes people inevitably profit it. scale government cares about? Probably not. said case 'mask industry' benefits people wearing masks compelling least anyway. also worth remembering there's literally zero evidence whatsoever revealed true would immediately finish government providing absolutely benefit them.

Not everything conspiracy. [Around 8k according plan would mass- eliminate Republican voters November though. Unless student instructor one, know talking about. BS nothing check box applying medschool. chem/bio degree entirely worthless nothing piece paper. could next *catch can* lol it’s Local cases COVID-19 Malaysia zero 4 days think.

And less 100 active cases 2 weeks? cares? Cuomo DeBlasio slow walked response, reacting slow cautiously hit city state. March, teachers knew begging schools close. still riding subway meeting friends bars-- disaster.

The city connected, tightly packed way avoid unless shut proactively February. hit, hard shut along rest country. late. nightly ambulance sirens throughout city.

Cuomo late game, pivoted, proved effective leader guiding response setting clear goals. Albany set target goals requirements HELD THEM. DeBlasio get credit me. 

We learned tragedy. learned. Hotspots need hard shut two months want anything better simmering boil. Lol. 5 less people hospital, probably died.  Believe not, people planet believe nation withstand full scale nuclear strike Boss makes dollar, make dime... user known agenda Sweden automatically downvoted lot people sub know whatever say extremely biased. the-boy-who-cried-wolf syndrome, expect taken seriously anything proven unreliable source. canadian citizen, living ont *lol* one thing, cerb pay 3 days, took lot longer many pretty exclusive. however incredibly grateful it, example response timing this. 
the canadian government moves slowly, many aspects that's bureaucracy ask public servant.
our covid response something im proud part but, still slow terms shutting mandating masks etc  Good know! help point concerned returning work. situation going continue getting worse. He’s wrong that.  Young people didnt die huge numbers second wave flu pandemic... still plenty time covid-19 end same. design. let's honest. Eastern Oregon also Idaho

Let's face it, America rural areas Kentucky. won’t listen it... Thats key, states can’t it, Feds, Fed dgaf. Thats coming florida die. Disney themed Covid™️

Be first tell friends family got Covid Disney! Everyone who's upset Disney World opening, could try boycott Disney. know seen really discussed this. really crazy following medical advice wear mask keep social distancing called ""sheep"" behavior. stupid deny rapidly rising number cases?

The actions people result deaths, type behavior tolerated. Oh, get wrong, 100% masks, firm believer masks work. refusing entry people wearing masks looong time ago. 

The reason i'm salty masks AC ducting unbalanced workplace. gets hot area masks compound issue holding heat/humidity close face start sweating. :( get frustrated people prolonging discomfort — suffering people close me, elderly parents catch — selfish reasons. Personal freedoms ass. I'm glad worry much transmitting anybody now. 

You're absolutely right there's alternative right now. People need wear masks. 

You probably tell enjoy proven wrong coming constructive agreement. *definitely* worded first comment differently taken time explain position, least bunch people presented dissenting opinions upvoted probably changed people's minds. Soo, really mind. I'm glad saw research, it'll help help people make informed decisions masks wear sanitation practices have.  necessarily. Patriarchy system disproportionately affects men, call misandry would you? Feminists talk harmful effects patriarchy men. One particular example give concept toxic masculinity. men patriarchy unreasonable expectations expected live somehow makes failure societal standards. think consider feminists veer misandry, unreasonable. mean look haircut. Tells need know. Dont worry lad it'll local warehouse implement rules regulation

I mean sure worked Covid response USofA eh Damn Skippy!!! Florida #1 Wuhan!!!!! could slowed pulsed temporary lockdowns mask requirements. using methods. rising. yesterday tested 800k people mean, investigation? There's photo evidence sitting without it. enough? Serology studies put 20% back April NYC. number confirmed cases doubled since then.

And surprising public health official would credit agency beating virus instead admitting herd immunity played substantial role. Public health officials seem willfully ignorant topic herd immunity think undercuts need job exist. Instead, understand immunity another tool arsenal.

Keep mind herd immunity binary thing. Every % population infected reduces R. Due population heterogeneity, get double impact, 25% infected drop R 50%. Masks, distancing, etc. also help reduce R. immunity preventative actions work together hopefully reduce R 1, NYC much northeast. took exact preventative actions population little immunity, would still see exponential spread. ""Not needed"" ≠ ""Not recommended"" ≠ ""Recommended against"" experience dealing angry patients I'm sure translates retail, goes: ""Good morning Sir/Madam (show respect bat help minimize conflict), name XXX (humanize yourself, increase likelihood treat like human being), may moment time? afraid mask policy (don't say word mandatory, sound apologetic, make sound like fault personally supporting it) may kindly request wear mask here, would *really* appreciate it. (Make voice sweet possible helps)"" Make sure stand far enough away this, may spit (not nessecarily deliberately, everyone spit little talk without mask, course whole point. reasonable people would agree leave point, offer reasons not, would get firm, may want same, get angry remove situation seek safety first, consult management security policy directs. Take care love talking point keeps harping mistake made early on, considering governors straight murdering citizens every age. that's... okay? co-worker flew yesterday. said 70% plan masked. What’s point anyone wearing mask everyone required wear it? someone took pants, feel confident flight attendants would address it, pantsless asshat won’t kill you! mean, 20 years 21st century. Give time, I'm sure we'll break record! I’m person whole company wearing mask. emailed HR said can’t force everyone wear mask people may underlying health issues would made worse wearing one. LOL okay, good luck people get COVID then, guess.

Edit: I’m MD. moved Texas one year ago far signs made bad choice Yet ticks showing consrvatism mental illness. That’s Ted Cruz, that’s zodiac killer! Amazing contrast. Frankly, not. long virus keeps raging US, actually extremely unlikely we'll open borders let anyone in, let alone refugees. Though understand sympathise position, accepting refugees USA right would least mean go mandatory strict quarantine minimum month letting society. wartime refugees, bring war them. pandemic refugees, pandemic probably following shortly. Absolutely! south attest exactly state friends hey, atleast disney world still open !!!!!!! He's vaccinated, sooo... there's much unpack there.

When start looking like cult makes sense. link anything scientifically backed says someone reinfected? Ok cares paranoid ass thinks Isn’t point discussion? Unless trolling here...which case, thanks upfront it. Noted. 


   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ guy said force teachers students wear masks? determines smartest people are? smartest people? Soon don’t democracy anymore.

And people exceptional ways others. example, didn’t Trump really dumb brain surgeon staff while?

Overall education key. also need cultural shift away selfishness.  US, allowed ask people tested, part protest. air filtered extensively they're sanitizing heck everything. flew June impressed. cases linked plane flight yet I've heard of. think risk level going grocery store times. ""640K ought enough anybody!""

\- Bill Gates

(Note: Though one famous quotes, [probably actually say it.) ....or sheltering vulnerable letting virus slowly make way healthy population mitigate death. could argued higher, asymptomatic folks may never get tested....

Unfortunately way get clear picture infection percentages would numerous compulsory testing pools random people throughout Florida...but ya know ""but mai freedoms..."" That's disagree. think paraphrase accurate. yes, indicate paraphrase ' . English anyway. This. don’t forget value alumni networking schools. pay huge dividends leading graduation. thought student loans went next kin. I'll use miles think OP might mean ""more country (except three)"".
Let's say 60k cases day week = 420k total. 
This Peru, currently country fifth-most number recorded cases (330k total far). You’re fucking dolt. Millions settlers homesteaders used spend months seeing another soul. complains couple weeks. guy literally said even NY authority it, would do. LOL. gullible. think you’re well aware timing protests result timing death unarmed black man hands police. protesters acknowledged science accepted risk posed, wether good bad idea.

Contrast end-lockdown movement spouting literal anti science phrases “covid-19 flu”. 

Like Im talking literal anti-science beliefs words. agree timing protests awful say quite stretch. anti-science actually meaning, can’t use describe groups don’t like, actually need examples group spreading false information contradicts science. need one place, anywhere reasonable cut time posts daily teaspoons, yes still crazy. However think comes people guzzling soda way bread. 20oz coke, fairly normal thing drink every day people, 65 (sixty fucking five) grams sugar. Bread nothing compared that. Unless course eating loaf day. 1% that's really control, .01% - people rich even earn salaries anymore; make living investments. Members 1%, though wealthy, often still laborers - highly paid laborers, like $1,000 hour corporate lawyers whatever, laborers nonetheless. 

Once get .01%, longer ""work"" living. manage investments. people group somehow make money matter happens. Pandemic? make money. Global financial meltdown? make money. cannot get message class detachment profound. Whole wheat breads often contain added sugar help rising.
Otherwise fermentation rising take long time (think day), rise much. Ah yes remember. Well, could done that.  state governor walking back reopening plans school's said FU decided reopen?

Here's question answer l, let's say family tradition go McDonald's first day school yet right that's impossible state California. exactly parents tell children without making feel disposable?

If answer includes lot ""um"" ""I know"" count. would like offer Bloc Québécois. really sad. glad identified bottleneck. knew first everything go cdc taking two weeks. really sad still taking two weeks Actually, think non sentient president. example, population prevalence 5%, test 90% sensitivity 95% specificity yield positive predictive value 49%,"" CDC said website. ""In words, less half testing positive truly antibodies. Alternatively, test population antibody prevalence exceeding 52% yield positive predictive greater 95%, meaning less one 20 people testing positive false positive test recognize that's exactly said originally, test positive 50/50 chance actually positive versus false positive, that's incredibly informative.

You full shit. MANY! 99%+ live 'lasting health problems' real world.

Demonstrably false. Healthy people still end ICU this. Sure, might surivive, 'no big deal'. spreading whole ""Lasting health problems"" BS needs stop. 

[YOU need stop spreading They're expecting around 30,000 people die Florida September. ""100% Scandinavians assholes"", tomorrows expressen headline mean compare death rate per capita neighbors, paints pretty ugly picture see economy better sacrifice, kinda makes people like us wonder anyone would point Sweden positive example. 

Genocide may strong, sacrificed quite lives basically nothing gained. Thank calming paranoid mind. I'll wearing mask train next two years. get dozen masks

Found problem right here. Someone kept using ""anecdotal"" yesterday discussing me. Weird. odd word keep seeing subject? Coordinated talking point?  dunno Oh, I'd say 90% people sub assign report card US want talk countries handled covid better.

I see threads popping constantly great Vietnam countries doing. country barely tests people, yeah...you see lot infected people. mean cases. know accurate number.

In US know actual number cases either. Wait calling pediatricians medical degree morons comment topic children's health..... medical degree back facts opinion wrong? Edgy

There ""best"" ""worst"" thing that's happened planet, nature feelings. Either way, earth pelted meteors volcanic eruptions caused much worse extinction events. Faith-based medicine oxymoron.  Someone finally taking stand :( Careful, they'll call xenophobe. 30 mins sufficient per DECON Stanford group. Hah.

Where I’m from?  Well escalated quickly. recent estimate I've seen 25% NYC. people anti-mask dumbfucks, really slowing things down. jobs employee need buy safety equipment, budget? hospitals hire healthcare workers them, least US that, they'll fire bringing work. 

There's world that's fair deal healthcare worker. Either use money buy overpriced masks stay safe (and maybe get fired), risk friends/family dying want lose job helping people *are* risk death. wearing one anyway cut number tonsil stones inadvertently spits people. Yeah thats weird isnt it, NY daily death far higher whats currently reported Texas call body trucks. homeschool son autistic, local school district means accommodating effective manner. result, husband work combination part-time jobs, juggling work schedules homeschooling. despite 6 jobs us, still can't make ends meet receive food assistance. school district could provide accommodations child autism, could work, provide ourselves.

For low income workers kids school, school really serious blow way life. School lot free childcare. low-income workers, lot options available. Pulling child school concerned coronavirus work full-time home--that's choice many access. doomed species...we doomed Americans. Plenty countries care enough make changes People house parties wear masks.

200 thousand people area, spread everything. 

They needed articles justify, protests. wait .... know better group pediatricians? Yeah. added today ""Woopsy"" forgot tell guys yesterday 🤔 last time someone failed produce numbers day noted almost immediately.... know many nurses see half-ass mask chin strap. live city/hospital community. need quiz people read news. 

Are careless, terrified function, none above?

Careless people get bad news, terrified people get good news. They've opened outdoor seating pubs already they're opening indoors tomorrow, we'll see does. post comment twelve?  Stop extremist. virus situation either virus loads virus. huge number factors effect country deal virus, poor uneducated population living low standard conditions greatly increases risk transmission. know massive amount undiagnosed cases Malaysia. Yeah dumb fucks country. Specifically certain parts country individuals, Texans might favorite people Earth. 

In large groups, Texans might scariest people Earth. Well, lab reports confirmed cases, state question this?

If talk 10 positive 10 tested, see questioned. means tested people FOX 35 contacted labs reports says high positivity rate, labs rejected number, saying rate much lower.

They contacted 2 hospitas far, mean labs 100% positive reports wrong. Otherwise, would equally suspicious 100% negative (and noticed there's ""100"" well).      

Or maybe conclusion numbers fake, focus ICU, hospitalisation death rate real idea spread? people unemployed, risk belongings thrown streets missing rent, mortgage, etc.

They're ""at risk"" people choosing throw homes. talk like natural process control over. Man, relatively speaking CA well Gov. Newsom launched Phase 3 nowhere.

I guess policies really early right idea, initial shut came quickly, kudos that, never waited long enough policies really get spread control:

[California infection worse though, drastically lowered potential slope initial rise, crazy high NYC. 

&amp;#x200B;

Texas government say shutdown morgues fill up? learn anything... Eagles fans, still throw snowballs Santa Claus

FIFY Yeah neighbors' teen said ""likes living edge"". I'm like dumb shit dad morbidly obese, get covid stand chance. 
 
Meanwhile kids watch whatever wants without immediate repercussions. clue I'm certain people propagating informed either. doctors we're talking about, politicians. expect integrity jobs properly, especially risk getting license taken away. Transmission possible paper, even likely someone handling many different papers may virus it. that's wash hands touch face, since even picked glove-reusers, going fly paper nostrils. open windows trains, that's plus. Doh! see post. Thanks link. feel like universities reopening in-person classes, that's sign society care grandparents, students, faculty, anyone else dies.

As much never liked ""go grungy frat basement shotgun natty light"" crowd, also think fair ask behave responsibly elected officials twice age. [This recent could find, article June 30th. Approximately simple country good job controlling virus spread.

In US, even begun get control huge portion country. banks deserve it: American people (and anyone matter) deserve pain. I'm American, -- maybe worried extensive issues country bringing """"america"""" every single turn? Meanwhile Florida.....12k+ case day. juli har bjudit på lägre temperaturer än normalt.""

Edit: studied Environmental Science, dont even attack Climate Change Denial Er, Wales nearly 100 cases per 100,000 people England does, great. lot smaller.

 close. This. PCP first running low, hand sewed couple reusable masks donated hospital area. kept ""rejected"" ones friends (where sewing top notch.) wear 10 minutes, realized pattern used comfortably fit nose. try on, worked fine. slowly moved around, mask started slip nose pull back up, ruined safety mask. sad hope ones made git people received them! next stimulus needs help everyone, including landlords.  weird wonder much got. Surely millions though thing disappear night. lucky bastard. still mean restaurants still serve patios?  “Far evidence support reinfection point.” 

What?! isolated cases 13 million idea evidence not? isolated suspected reinfections likely explained false negatives, false positives, individual immune system disorders people. also realize PCR tests measuring viral RNA necessarily active, live virus. 

There lot stories published lowered levels antibodies short timeframe, insinuating antibodies part healthy immune system response. articles rarely touch t-cell memory. I’d move southern Ontario really like super nice mild winters-10 younger folks. Plenty boomers wear masks. also proven, overwhleming margin, Democrats wearing masks much higher rate. Somehow, dying political. people 'winning' USA funeral home directors gravediggers. I'll look silver lining....maybe douche bag cough Mitch McConnell think simple. 

The President pushing school openings country values day care education. 

AAP walking back position reopen schools tender little psyches children irretrievably damaged can't climb petri dish public schools.

The organizations similar bent sat talked around political gain important children.

The entire discussion based politics science. real problem. 

Parents - keep children home. Monday numbers always reason Singapore city-state port city. basically don’t manufacturing natural resources, rely almost completely international trade business. economy would tank regardless whether virus not.

EDIT: manufacturing, mean heavy industry mean saving live locking borders refugees? sounds like evil communism russian, hesitate taking russian medicine myself. imported stuff EU 100% safe, live outside Moscow St. Petersburg everything else often stretched placebo. Texas Florida reach similar numbers weeks. They're ""presumed"".. whats point? still ~51k. ways Dude professional propagandist constantly downplaying covid. Check comment history. Claims parents died (which blames doctors for), also claims [""just source data using look moving average? one day potentially omitted, miscalculated, corrupt data worth celebrating eyes see adjacent data. Ugh. that's confirmed cases. Face coverings made compulsory *all* UK....  sad playing exactly predicted. younger people spread family members, risk people. Yes. evidence points NYC right thing places right thing. conjecture science, shit posting. Camps guess. Someone posted proof elsewhere ITT Decent teacher's union oxymoron. They're weak. say remember we're talking exponential growth way November. even seen explosion cases schools reopening.

That's 3.5 months deaths doubling week week without schools open currently.

If at, say 120 deaths day, doubles every week that's millions dead November.

I trying suppress voting anything, I'm actually arguing crawling glass actually poor analogy glass hurts you. 

Voting South raging pandemic without lockdowns masks like crawling glass making whole family you. Getting Covid polls infect you. Love seeing Americans, especially south southwest taking greatest sport world, Canada give sport 4 months, anybody can. Hows covid wuhan? Okay, virus could managed people started taking responsibility part flatten curve. makes sense, wonder MSHA would allow KN95's FDA approved healthcare use. complain wont feel anything try fuck us. Damn Elon. Get shit together. USA sends people, they're sending best. They're sending people lot problems, they're bringing problems us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. some, assume, good people. flu season around corner, schools possibly opening back up.  worry - needed (and it'll probably needed) add another 30 days.

They've done 4 times yet since march airlines losing millions every week. wants airline known let jackasses disregard protocol?

Why guys make excuse bastards time?

How many Benghazi deaths Texas get per day now? guess masks nothing it. pointed New York lower listed nursing home deaths states, pointed New York deliberately misleads way record deaths.  company? long wait?   Right. want go state two away, burn least 2 days way driving. 

But right now, fuck major recreational travel. People talking it’s forefront hard enough get people take threat death potentially inadvertently killling others seriously begin with.


Also people cooperating mitigation efforts (social distancing, mask wearing, contract tracing etc.) tend type person think long term. later health problems? view problem later. Yes! policies Newsom's responses right initial stages. That's surprising sudden launch Phase 3. Basically dangerous military, respect individuals' ability ""social distance"" oneself others. they've equated listening experts brainwashing liberal media propaganda (because fake news). also problem, yes. one person taking mask off, yes, danger, dangerous loss credible source news. First rule fascism playbook destroy independent sources information. need help right take mainstream media. reason virus allowed become widespread NYC president denying virus even soil back March. NYC slowly succumbing took doctors going behind CDC begin testing. Remember beginning? States even allowed test people unless fell small category returned China last week. complete negligence feds part. Yep. seen Wisconsin, Kentucky, Georgia recently... comment replied deleted.
I planned reading tonight, thst curious studies I'm online school year fuck like People like also problem. research depressions recessions indicate mortality goes down.

Why think otherwise? basis? Seems like pure speculation me. Important note 842 backdated positive cases also added today Wales, websites might show UK 1,240 new cases today. Short contracting COVID themselves, want anyone, honestly know what's going humble people. We've already seen stories people loved ones dying still rally mask wearing. numbers scare people, even backyard like Florida. Even state local officials follow advice scientists, people still ignore warnings.

The worst part all? healthcare workers paying ultimate price this. selfish idiots would rather haircuts find piece cloth face oppressive.

I hope kind awakening, really do, given we've seen thus far, can't see Americans changing ways. least, fast enough useful. Death toll skewing heavily towards minorities since history poor medical care less likely work careers WFH Doesn’t influenza immunity last longer [90 Conservatives trying kill public education decades. probably see great way advance plan literal way possible ... Yeah can! Alone this.

Together. see 12 deaths reported NYC?  everyone going die matter Thats big maybe Yeah, I'm NJ, NYC area. really hard encforced lockdown. Trains subways kept running. wanted shorter, would locked harder. Still helps keep things control controlled reopening. One minute idea weather spring Sweden, backtrack. back sounding like live lol. 

Why effect decreased spread disease seen countries warm weather allows everyone outside day? 

I really ask questions. seriously ""researching"" topic, try falsify preconceived ideas.  Don’t let perfect enemy good. don’t drop Rt 0, keep &lt;1. love friendly demeanor summarized impending doom feel like I've hearing ""Texas healthcare system verge collapse"" month half collapse never comes There's even people Oregon Washington believing too. I'm guessing must Fox News similar outlet rightwing sheep running it. Sorry boys, must high 40th parallel ride! Thank you! specific example thinking of, link looks helpful shit, apparently many Americans god damn stoopid know that.

I'm Illinois, good response, early lock downs. However, Karens think governer worst. forcing business shut ""plandemic"". kept saying look southern states open fine.....fast forward today....everyone forgot southern states happy Illinois almost back normal. fail accept/realize reason getting back normal state officials response.

Plus, people see families suffering economy keep suffering. approach taken Republicans insane. refused deal crisis, refused listen professionals, kept feeding bs misled public numerous times, hoping make economy chug along virus would become big deal. are, one worst hit countries world, arguing wearing fucking masks. anti-intellectualism fucking strong US ignorance even celebrated way. guy thinks he’s clever announcing limited vocabulary. virus supposed dangerous h warmed right ? 


Edit: Ya'll downvote like 45 said would get better got hot heard lots people throwing around talking point months ago :   Coordination problems. particular, mind giving million dollars peers gave million dollars, across thousand that's billion dollars, that'd real change experience walking outside. alone, million bucks go far, really get much it.

That vocal ones already giving directly. quiet ones, like friends Koch brothers, massive incomes spend none charity. American: Florida old people go retire? like bad? True. Nearly every business hurting right now, financial trouble. even close. Excellent thank ! happy hear this, Congratulations New York!
I hope get level sooner better later! IDK, kind think lot touring Americans think foreign laws really apply them. instances scientifically backed reinfections I'll admit I'm wrong. Otherwise, they're anecdotes easily attributed false testing talking “This Week Virology” weekend. seen definitive reinfection cases, implications still unknown.

EDIT: I've told another thread added 800 cases Wales' total missed before, explains it. colleges letting students defer scholarships? students option take it.

It’s going take years economy recover point graduating ASAP. Like protests f'n stupid timing drawing false conclusions link two. click bait target audience particular paper. forms used airports arrival. checking people. also applies live NY go states. guy US senator state record number deadly infection per day, makes news care following safety rules forced follow.

Why hard get it? see reply misconstrued. hard low-income parents, circumstances truly take away choice. feel lucky able homeschool, though challenge, get flack welfare. get douchebag? dont get it.

Sorry personal. yeah. dont get it. trying push people mock people months now. dont get it. feel like jinxed saying Space Needle ditching fireworks lieu light show bad omen 2020 would one disappointment missed opportunities 

Whoops

Time add belladonna hemlock tea fan Ted Cruz least... gate photo show coffee pointed out. American airlines in-flight coffee... must obtained boarding. good chance view blocked seats photo. 

Not making excuse him, saying photo really definitive. could Quarter pounder cheese beanie baby collection lap, know.  You’re wrong. That's still 15 minutes hostile customer til police show usually nothing comes it. Accurate Right one outside it’s hot .

Absolutely true. disgusting  Big pharma Monsanto. Things like Alar Scare convinces Americans science poisons food. price medications convinced Americans meds big scam make money. It’s country everyone need watch trying screw next. ice cream.

FTFY. Found think understand. stage getting set since Reagan. decades trickle-down economics, deregulation, tax cuts natural conclusion. president giving (american) bailout next wave Corona sweeps country record numbers next 60ish days less, people realize shouldn’t flying entire time. ""Psychopaths"" preferred terminology, Dude. MAGA FrEeduM PaTRioTz, please. Americans using excuse need check property repair property sidestep ban.


At least that's ones doors place saying,they're *make repairs property*, even though visible damage renovation occuring. good comparison havent nearly amount spread? likely. 

talking weather sometimes friends give enough credit say example ”it’s unseasonably warm” ”considering much rains”.  America cannot come reasonable compliance guidelines scientists think necessary mitigate reverse rapid climate change, matter live Japan. feel effects.

America produces waste massive consumer resources.

So think going effect don’t live here?

🤔

Sounds like tribalism short sighted thinking  Fucking zodiac killer strikes Queens beach. Understandably would busy hot weekend kinda gross many people beach like sardines. Many without masks. rode bike still bit surreal. mean, feel free spend lockdown without movies, tv, video games, comics, music... Ill fight streets motherfucker let’s go!

🤣 Yup, I’m terrified visiting parents giving them. I’d feel horrible. visit I’d try camp like month yard interacting them. know it’s crazy I’d rather safe sorry. Im osky yeah town full anti-maskers/people don’t care you’re rooting that? :/  coworker telling relative 23 California decided go cross country road trip testing positive “didn’t feel bad”. selfish people there. Ironically, nudists pretty good wearing masks nowadays mean, we're literally first world nation without socialized healthcare all.

And we're first world nation without guaranteed paid sick leave vacation.

And we're first world nation costs 18 year olds $40,000+ go college.

Sooooo... first world nation right thing global pandemic fits right in. MUH FREEDUMBS got virus later, locked earlier outbreak, stayed locked longer (and harder), result lower peak. luck, means it.

Population density factor plenty people live close together Scottish cities plenty rural places England. Ultimately, matter much space places people live: matters space one person next. *last* peak, there's plenty people still infected peak again, worse, without proper steps avoid situation. Yea that's majority cases are.  include Eagles games?  ""If ain't first, last.'

-Ricky Bobbie Well better sense constitutes actual crisis vs media tells afraid of. actual doom horizon easily people's fears manipulated. seem absorbed quite bit someone can't afford cable. NY numbers constant 2-3 weeks, sure thats positive negative Brit, I’m sorry foreigners aren’t blame. It’s people flouting rules. nice see cases dropping. pay attention daily new cases much ACTIVE cases state. 

Granted live Central Maine away craziness Cumberland County.

It's 50/50 split masks here. Granted go grocery store every 2 weeks work 1-2 days week(work home time). 

1 thing odd wear mask, others seem take right next safe mask people stay away.

You see plenty pictures videos people masks standing right next other. videos seen mask testing block lot droplets still allows droplets air even masks, distance kept. People tried that. person without mask pulls gun knife demands served. Yeah hunch complicated cases elderly became fatal faster March April. like school-age children walking petri dishes anyway . . . Hey kind state...on fire...with leadership...and complete disregard safety measures...okay yeah right send back here. 

On plus side Disney’s open...


I’m sad So, one requiring traveling. Keep safe. What’s going Floridians? lower IQ? old people thus higher covid numbers? Really? Where? Fuckin' dum dums! found San Diego. 

I’m amazed haven’t traced outbreaks protests, not. pattern repeated across country, I’m starting believe outdoor protests majority wear mask don’t lead Covid spread. Sometimes need change pre-conceived opinions evidence overwhelming opinion wrong. One might call adult. CDC website vaccine development. relevant bits stage tests for. Clinical development three-phase process. Phase I, small groups people receive trial vaccine. Phase II, clinical study expanded vaccine given people characteristics (such age physical health) similar new vaccine intended. Phase III, vaccine given thousands people tested efficacy safety.

And wrote. People, like you, emphasizing rushed without understanding means context. first two phases trials dedicated safety, completed, third face begin test efficacy, aka thing actually work. Phase 3 'rushed' typically need show large difference control group vaccinated group without deliberately exposing vaccinated group virus. 

Do see difference? dad worked ""pharmaceutical trials decades"" matter here? Ah, okay. That's funny people leave countries droves wanting somewhere else even US. Russia Romania falls least desirable countries live especially first world countries. bunch hate want. ;) Yeah Nordics go it’s 18 degrees, windy rain it’s bad Nordic standards. /s Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

It seems reasonable summer drops R value. mean case flue. 

But need drop claim march Stockholm outdoorsy. year certainly even less so. 

Can accept truth still difficult? internet friend. Honestly im sure entirely state's fault. Absolutely one worst hit places state governments average (globally average) best, testing infrastructure *at all* start, mention general unpreparedness country whole. NY closed halfway march, well NE states. That's pretty decent timing west coast cases much sooner same. Oh, absolutely agree you. Things way built way continue feed bullshit system, man's design. I'm speaking current actual situation feels like live America, least perspective. got sauna home? Helps heat shock proteins. Also vitamin D. take 2 billion IUs. Keep immune system up. Here's gorilla kettlebell. whiskey pot cigars 1pm. Also performing Houston.

Yeah. I'm done read Asian OOOO

If don’t know mean: Lol, that's Texas poll, wait weeks Covid tears poll again. *kid removes shield, picks nose* Hoping TX, FL, AZ get curve like this, :( idea long last, able extend life significantly doubling surgical mask.

I believe protocol lot medical professionals using.  ""105% Scandinavian assholes, believe happens next!"" - Aftonbladet “Give two weeks” This.

It's first baby Lockdown US work. People saw parents going Home Depot, friends going beaches, thought ""Hey, gonna Lockdown thing nobody else seems to."" fighting war soil. fought Europe Asia. part, life went normal here. Businesses schools shut down, people socialized gathered normally. difference young soldiers fighting thousands miles away. sure that's comparable. glad went Feb, gonna hosting events loooooong time😅 Invoking nazis disagree someone isn’t particularly helpful way changing minds.

Of course flexibility, variation mean lack bounds coherent patterns cannot extracted. 

You even identified one pattern economic system

The basic state nature abject poverty. 'evil' economic system created world people behave altruistically. Tesla could set nice example businesses openly defy public health laws. Contact trace 130 — trace everyone infected, etc., etc.

One giant lawsuit waiting lawyer guts money. everyone treats every interaction transactional zero-sum, even things supposed friendly convivial, unsurprising many people damaged. mean, think it, used ask friends neighbor help move pull tree stump, usually no-problem, got pizza six pack courtesy thanks. Even ten years ago. Now, everyone expects something outsized return. front. often flake. **A R H E P R** see another useless politician, notice high end clothes quality wal mart fashion sitting next he’s supposed make life better for.  He’s enjoying life, flying around world, scamming millions, getting nothing done sit ass talk phone day calling “working”. That's true, bad CDC clearing house information, one agency. place pronounced please? serious? Memorial? George Soros, Bill Gates, Nancy Pelosi, China Flu, Democrats, Socialism.

That's control us man...the masks. even stop virus. smell fart pants on. Imagine flight making fun zodiac killer? couldn’t. Sounds like Dallas beating enough don’t bother There's always catch! That's *get ya.* zodiac killer strikes again.... Um yeah, people 40 also likely work ""essential"" jobs ( retail fastfood) exposed getting sick? Right, don’t many dumb people since probably spend enough public education... think longer that, maybe twice long. takes die, takes generate death certificate. death certificates coded hand, places start things like ordering refrigeration trucks, there's definitely going backlog numbers make whoever reporting deaths public consumption.

None red herrings. It’s related. wouldn’t downplay masks protect frontline workers, Trump job properly diligence forethought. 140,000+ wouldn’t died Trump left everything place Obama administration. 

You don’t get choose perceive you. you’re making point coincidentally White House propaganda push makes suspicious. conclude undermine Fauci. I’m going you’re showing thread. gotta say Trump mostly responsible American Covid catastrophe I’ll give benefit doubt. understand agree masks amd distancing key everyone contribute fight8ng thing. otherhand, practically chance spreading virus outdoors 90% situations people continue wear masks, would little silly get mad people wearing masks said situations. course know everything yet probably never will. know concentrated infected droplets, likely going infected. studies seen thus far show airflow dramatically impacting concentration particles. Admittedly know much exposure takes virus, precautions certainly justified wherever whenever possible. let's equate indoor benefits outdoor benefits. Washington's state-wide mask mandate even exempts outdoor use unless crowds. Im sure level data guide decision. Can't wait holiday bump. 

""But Christmas! indoor gathering whole family, it... it... Christmas! live lives!""

As u/hopeishigh said, know generation transmission symptomatic patients were.

Even someone tested negative start voyage, could early incubation period. 40% cases asymptomatic, transmitted one person (not improbable - lower viral load = fewer symptoms less transmission, average) virus makes way around ship slowly takes root someone starts spreading higher viral load suddenly widespread symptoms.

While might assume everyone lined caught disease time place, could taken weeks get stage.

Okay. translate public use? went thought would difficult decision make. clear many people states choose open bars childrens' education. false positive 3 times likely actually catch covid? canadian here, new york locked neighbouring states? work? checkpoints? biggest concern US eventually strongarm us reopening border (ie- threaten cut trade don't) States seem increasingly want border open.

You notice Times article link longer video up. took down.

And article pretty conspicuously put following sentence - ""The Times could independently verify Dr. Appleby’s account.""

So that's ... interesting.

As fact nobody identify man. wouldnt want anyone give name like Covid victims, right? Times tried contact family comment (through hospital course) family respond. Note - didnt say ""no comment"" anything, never responded.

So maybe context, hm?

But anyways ... bit, Dr Appleby starts anecdote ""I heard heartbreaking story week .."" puts pretty squarely ""reported anecdote"" category.

I mean ""official statement hospital"" there, issues ""patient/doctor privilege"" ""malpractice"" apply. Whenever see sort stuff, wonder kind *House Cards* stuff going behind scenes.

There's also US MDs graduate trash ass Carribean medical schools like Antigua, Ross, St. George legit less knowledge 1st year medical intern. 

The US also uses much mid tier medical staff like nurse practitioners physician assistants country combined. also ones consider DOs ""doctors"" go school osteopathy. DOs even exist anywhere outside US.

[I’m Covid reported deaths even began really hit high stride Texas.. They've one week elevated deaths.. possible they're running space.

Anyone updated excess mortality data state? best thing minimize risk infection. CDC [very good individuals practice. Regardless others do, CDC recommends reduce risk. people follow advice, risk goes everyone. difficult, proven work countries and, government help, people despite poor decisions governments health care companies. tenured profs selling indie-bound textbooks always need latest edition of.

I'd willing bet average age employees lower. company relies growth much pay debt really choice open up. never going purchase Tesla, kid virtue signal like that... Yeehaw 🤞 think official cases like 4.8% population, far far herd immunity.

BUT 32k deaths huge chunk uber-vulnerable population really reduces deaths. Plus, serological studies back april showed almost 20% population displaying antibodies, would much higher double confirmed cases, disease continues spread hits non-vulnerable people might asymptomatic bother get tested they're young.

So herd immunity doubtful, possible R almost even 1 point. Oxford is.  Maybe people join, month time US even fucked now. Dignified well-thought response, representative intellect of, well, someone Louisiana.  Sure. even low end numbers we're looking half million dead people US. That's acceptable you?

Edit: summarize-

Fourteen percent employed population low literacy skills;

23 percent low numeracy skills, 62 percent low digital problem solving skills (USDOE).

1 every 6 adults U.S. lack basic reading skills – means 36 million people can't read job application, understand basic written instructions, read Internet (COABE, 2017).

2 every 6 adults U.S. cannot handle basic numbers, like working cash register understanding transit schedule (COABE, dumbing citizens intentional. 70th prescribed drug US, patented 1960s. say: lock separate quarantined cells force new visitors least 10 days quarantine.

 according osha amazon cant bet see Donny float idea postponing election due covid too. virus disappear! really can't use population density - 70% Scots stay central belt crowded England.

We crappier weather keeps us house lot more. baltic beaches packed Bournemouth.

Scotland lot ethnic minorities seem suffering most. look worst hit areas England moment. Leicester, Bradford, Blackburn, Rochdale demographics nothing like anywhere Scotland. 

I think also fear might worse ever dealing Covid, almost went along Sturgeon surprisingly compliant rules. model X love it, Elon really $how$ $mart one area one dumbe$t other$. one recommend (that well) take 5 deep breaths in/out \~10 second holds #5, breathe extra deep cough hard can. Repeat 2x. Then, lay stomach 15 minutes breathe deeply, without holding. multiple times per day. 15 minutes part takes lot time (who cares Covid), coughing part painful (during Covid), easy post-Covid.  addition, also hold breath long can. bother taking deep breath point deprive body oxygen force body make red blood cells. hold long enough I'm taking involuntary breaths, start clenching hands distract myself, feel lightheaded afterwards, driving.  breathe deeply afterwards really open lungs. throw cough well. mainly walks. Virginia Republican announced tested positive Twitter, wrote self-isolating since noticing symptoms, says currently ""significant."" 

Pointless say that, first week almost always survivable. Idk Europe asia opened schools arent seeing massive uptick cases. three drive shootings yesterday! Real utopia. Yes live Queens dead. Actually, yay. Pfizer, starters, control production taking money US government, that's one less thing worry about. Also, FDA still maintaining standards production. We've actually recent incidents contamination prescription meds made overseas, likely downplayed. 

For US, takes risk vaccine production. India, example, indicated start pandemic allow viable vaccine leave India India vaccinated, that's actually real risk. 

Lastly, simply cuts problems shipping. Easier ship land overseas, especially vaccines need kept certain conditions, like staying refrigerated.

And, course, means jobs.

So, good thing US. Zing! Damn good one! really, nyc better virus already wiped killed vulnerable. Labour day thanksgiving gonna fun period USA ey answer y'all could read forget goggles. virus enter eyes. make good click bait. thumbnail looks like obese man wearing hyper realistic Ted Cruz mask  happening Universal weeks now, ya late, Disney ain’t backing down. Shareholder here, I'm thinking another kayak level. believe company well near future combating virus, feels like I'm helping fund cure. Let's hope good results!

Edit: Well take understood Zombie-land reference! catch virus party, go store, breathe heavily, next person becomes infected dies.

Did kill innocent? Herd immunity vaccination herd immunity infection two different things. Vaccination roughly random infection hits high-contact people first. high numbers quote based equation HI vaccination. Sometimes, wonder people watch old classics.

If did, explain Kane type person even poor man would jealous of. such, neither Bezos.

If jealous, I'd jealous Warren Buffet Bill Gates III. Bezos, deserves pity envy. would love hear inside scoop planning closing schools fall, waiting states open earlier fail reopening examples cite they’re closing.

I think/hope they’re doing. Please don’t open schools PhIladelphia think indoors + a/c probably great combo. using high risk people (like old fat people) 99.5% chance surviving without vaccine anyway. aliens exist must passed kind similar situation managed. I’m talking less corona climate change, overpopulation limited resources. catching coronavirus much burden 7 metrics used allow regions NY get phase 4. 30 tests per 1000 people per month one along decreasing deaths, hospitalizations, hospital capacity, contact tracing. Please America, stay Maine over. 

Where live Lewiston crazy seeing 8 cases - almost masks sight, huge parties everywhere, massive soccer basketball games, indoor dining. Maine needs wear masks, cancel indoor dining, remain vigilant. like getting triggered Americans talking personal experiences, happen America, acting like fact means one thinks rest world exists.

Now artistic dumbassary. PCR swabs rarely generate false positives. IgM antibodies take 15 days develop, IgG typically develop within days often low people asymptomatic infections mild symptoms. case would require sensitive test pick up. would assume positive take precautions. Sometimes it’s good one cool kids. mean, there's shops opening up. able eat westville outdoors, farmers market... Museums closed, yeah. reason head close.
The parks open, highline opening up, Los Tacos 1 back! world healing :)  get rid long term capital gains tax rate. Income taxed income. I'm WFH, whole team is. Bad economy resulted bonuses lost. 20% income. Economy bad resulted everyone level taking 20% pay cut. Layoffs result fewer people work. 

40% lower income I'm working 12-16 hour days keep head water. 

Then they'll wonder put notice leave moment find different role different company. New Yorker sees Californian different Portuguese sees Kazakh? Honest question. 
New York California = Portugal Kazakhstan exactly precisely calls for? California shut earlier new york, no, New York shut “right away”. Also, virus came California first that’s community spread first detected. large percentage New Orleans. Now, NOLA act together (for part), rest state shitting bed. Phase Two mistake. Agree want start saying field work claim opinions viable, I'm putting thoughts see others think. 

For theory make sense start assumption discover indeed reinfected virus based recent studies question.

My theory reason seeing varying levels illness recent studies proven sewage tests dating way back 2019 virus us longer initially thought. knowing people saying well pandemic start sooner? Perhaps happening assuming reinfection possible depending number times infected dictates ill based infection slowly damaging body. Say ppl first infection generally asymptomatic mildly ill, clears confusion ppl get sick don't. reach third even possibly four time infected people ending hospital serious complications due prior damage last boughts fighting off. 

Again expert way claiming facts theory true would fill lot blanks including different countries seeing varying degrees illness death. Places like Italy others Europe perhaps tourists hot spots already population go first second infections ppl third fourth hence seeing hospitalization death.

Thank taking time read this, put thoughts hopes people knowledge viruses could explain theory even possible. think /r/The_Donald used call technique concern trolling. cuomo stop putting nursing homes? worry, Vietnam back. sent 1 ppe mercy shipment, send more. believe sub Sahara countries going door door collect ppe US. 

Truly unbelievable teachers staff schools matter? definitely risk. families? maybe people go infect?

What kids families get infection children? people would go infect.

Think man. take genius figure out. could also get test. Ever hear martial law? Also effectively happened March? We're still wiping stuff down. bag items store, put back cart, wipe bagging car. Maybe really overkill, 4 household, much risk us get sick (we'll wind it). 

Maybe lived somewhere else I'd feel comfortable wiping stuff down, I'm L.A. County we're getting hit really hard again. people masked, Branch Covidian still shopping masks defiantly noses best thank wife done. truly hero owe nothing utmost gratitude both.   also interesting graphic site showing live NJ.

We may well different country.

Our governors worked together move lockstep.

Cuomo shit businesses, Murphy Lamont followed suit next day.

Murphy issued mask order, Cuomo Lamont far behind.

We handled plague like rock stars almost start (I blame delay governors waiting guidance White House never came) prouder NJ.

Yeah said I'm proud NJ. Armpit nation not, least COVID control.

And Taylor Ham. China slapped sanctions. would like California announcing 23,000 cases day, adjusted population. guys getting paid?? Yeah cat around definitely helps. [fort bend ISD already disregarding bullshit He's piece shit. one ever write article saying anything negative black lives matter.

And bother you? Oh never mind post history says all. really heard term long-hauler reporting story, although survivors' stories really devastating, Facebook group inspiring thought it'd worth sharing may help people coping illness. Yes universities reopening planned well all. one go starts month students need sign renew leases university given us information option online semester ""coming soon"" last month half since released reopening plan. lot reopening plan seemed like cop-outs on-campus housing already completely full seriously doubt anti-science anti-mask people even high school education. even get ""office"" job? Mississippi ever dumpster? I’m vaccines. However, I’m also rightly skeptical long term effects rushed vaccine. take vaccine? Absolutely. want wait see do? Absolutely. know may happened gone get there. Basement could flooded would known. open cottage spring never know see. Wtf censorship bullshit? ""high-quality"" information? part post ""high-quality"" information? article says he's Republican, photo caption says he's Democrat.

Which he? Facebook friend posted couple days ago. googled around see news stories quote it, blogs paraphrased saying. 

So told friend findings think true, edited post say probably true.  Covid19 already, believe I've exposed least two times since initial recovery. times get one day symptoms twenty-four forty-eight hours later gone. scientific, believe immunity, least initially. many studies said, perhaps three months. I'm wondering get re-exposed monthly, perhaps able keep immunity longer I'm hoping re-exposure resets three month clock. Yep. Resources include staff; nurses allied health professionals run complex tangle spaghetti ventilator multi organ support seriously finite resource. work certain amount time level pressure stress, full PPE burning out. Whilst trying train supervise staff who’ve never set foot ICU drafted ‘skill set’ paper crapping what’s going around them.

We (so far) hit lightly pressure ICU work spike taken toll psychologically yet faced relative mole hill compared Everest US. fear long term health fellow nurses fear future come winter. article posted was: ""No new Covid-19 deaths Scotland sixth day row""

Such big difference events. mean really, deaths preventable country acted better, divided. pandemic fundamentally changed views America. provincial premiers? No, really. elected representatives - said, official Opposition. 

The premier Manitoba's job what's best Manitobans, they're free criticize governments federal municipal think something - absolutely never based wholly party lines. Again, falls purview federal parties. 

Suggesting would result NDP/Liberal echo chamber downright strange, honestly. require ignoring existence actual Opposition, Bloc larger NDP right now, boot. Everywhere else lied numbers.... /s Study says provided option testing 72 refused. 139 contacted reported symptoms. watch speak without feeling immediate revulsion

You're stronger man Ironically NYC one corona states? makes salty successful businessman? sound... jealous? lot numbers picture important, sorry that.

Basically average amount days passed since newly reported deaths today covid case reported state 12. There's outliers though, example one reported case came 79 days earlier reported death, nearly 3 months ago.

I'd say pretty surprising, would've expected lot longer delay. guess would lot labs huge delays report positive tests 1-2 weeks, whilst reported deaths little delay. Otherwise numbers would impossible takes like 3 weeks die infection. fellow Minnesotan agree.

Masks NEED become mandatory. scares seeing recall Walz signs town people refuse believe serious crisis. Sure seems so... I'm surprised consider managing aspects property nothing. Rent usually costs significantly less house payment, people would paying normally wanted roof head. Even case provided roof, legally inclined provide much that, still pay property know anything houses, know expensive. assuming already paid off, probably particularly likely. honestly decent options poorer people, probably capital get house even did, stability credit start ridiculous 20-30 year loan. two things suck it, pay long live end it, however, lot responsible managing lot stable financially.

As true many things, suspect truth lie in-between. that's conjecture based experiences viruses. Deaths going down, going up!

The local minimum July 5th.   think you’d need total infections, control group blinded.  well hopefully decent enough study warrent label use FDA try people hospital. although think people super sick benefit since immune response killing thought things get worse, US Administration shows level corruption sink order fool moron supporters.  produced, we're still waiting final results deploying it.

Socialization big part childhood development. feeling safe.

Kids ways socialize remotely ever human history. Even locked increasingly *want* interact screens. Sitting class room day kids need right now. 

As feeling safe, that's fault governments allowing virus spread like wildfire around them. Sending back school control watch friends, teachers parents get sick and/or die around going help feel safe. Bringing home virus kills loved ones could seriously fuck rest lives. need leadership, see everyone working together get virus control, progress made fight.

Not like 90% less deaths per number infected. also charged failure keep Florida.  can’t make lemonade don’t wood. yet supporters never happier certainly not. 


If talking solely risk KIDS, schools open better safer closed. We're already seeing terrible rises food insecurity child abuse result lockdown. That's totally ignoring fact socialization *crucial* development young kids, idea effects missing year socialization are. Kids extremely low risk comes SARS CoV-2, estimated deaths/illnesses happened young kids (I'm talking K-8) outnumbered impacts abuse, neglect, food insecurity. 


*However,* opening schools still dangerous many states impact adults, we're ready yet. question is, combat issues? provide food money parents, I'm sure prevent abuse lack socialization. much smarter people think ways. 


Also everyone thread acting like pediatricians rich touch. Let's clear- average pediatrician big city practicing attending 10 years (so age 40-45 so) would *lucky* touch 200k work 60 hours week, uncommon 300-400k debt. trying save college, pediatricians definitely can't afford send kids fancy private schools. Every one know kids public school. reimbursement structure fact kids qualify Medicaid, lot doctors actually lose money Medicaid patients, pediatricians general generate revenue hospitals. Thus they're paid fixed salary.


Edit: also, pediatricians socially conscious. School closings hurt low income/minority families most, time resources distance learning kids; many essential workers. year schools open up, low SES kids even *more* behind high SES kids already are, widening gap even further. need wash floor year summer house. need hang around two months make sure dries.

*Very essential.* 3rd degree burn... Well then, hundreds thousands US Covid deaths (and rising) beg differ. adhered CDC guidelines lot deaths, ones happening future could've prevented. went ""it's flu"" Cormac McCarthy's Road 8 months.

Maybe followed NZ's model, rely tourism large portion revenue contained virus better platform attempt somewhat normalize everything henceforth.

i know long would take finish phase 3, I've seen end August estimate, takes time review data get approval

That's 100 million doses though, there's guarantee oxford one gets approved. I've read 400 million doses could ready end year, that's still far ""everyone"". 

If oxford pass, moderna/pfizer/a couple others close phase 3. They're bit behind, would mean early next year get approved, that's still well next year enough doses created distributed everyone wants one. 

If UK/Europe/whoever else good relations UK/well connected people, expect best case scenario end year/early next year. Anyone else, might late end next year. underlying health issues would made worse wearing one

They could force everyone can't provide medical certificate wear masks. Also face shields good luck people get COVID then, guess

Unfortunately get Covid wear mask also greater risk get wear normal simple mask. chance course reduced, would better everyone wears one.  complete nonsense. ""Pick science""?

I sugar coat it, luckily Aunt principle Philly, told least discussed rationally. Sorry, main question whether really saying OK make people suffer abuse, malnutrition, everything else AAP mentions order slow virus? find better solution?

America overfunding problem underorganized, underthought, under-leadershiped problem. over-selfishness problem.

We throw money things left right often nothing. Left right share problem. country's issues structural. 

Sure public health likely underfunded, throwing money bureaucrats antidote woes.

NYTimes big part problem. pushed phoney Russiagate 1684 crap, focused facts plenty real life wrong things Trump doing, people would believe more. They've created big part mess mistrust we're in. Good news last day Everyone planet? 2-4 years.

Enough people tightly control pandemic? Hopefully late 2021- early 2022.

Enough high risk people make dent? 2021. Go room.   Yeah well ain't happening, TX 30% population still thinks hoax. believe masks, matter fact day someone told shove mask ass. Pathetic humans everywhere. protests. mention, intubation procedure something keeps ER docs awake night. everyone easy intubate, especially overweight individuals tend narrower tracheas. still money Oxford vaccine right now. power this?

Let’s go school!! tutor mathematics local community college. students lower levels like basic algebra required buy passcode $100 get access online site homework tests are. true even regular lecture classes. time physical textbook left totally unopened either professor's request student time read it. Textbooks college huge racket. can't buy used anymore stupid online access code course expires next year. like maths changed much last century. Maybe teaching style has, books still type material probably 20, 30, 50 years ago school. classes weird code requirements usually upper classes past calc 1 so, professors sceptical technology prefer use method, notes, require books choice usual Stewart/Pearson books. recent classes us buy books Serge Lang, like real maths books Pearson overpriced BS. Twice 😅 probably little correlation mask wearing/ rate spread areas aren’t heavily populated. next gonna tell gotta wear pants underwear where's end fair Idiocracy's depiction country.

Even President Camacho stepped aside let expert handle crisis scientific data shown wrong. Gosh new york again!! Florida next! I've asking question, nobody answered including notes senators representatives.

My takeaway getting closer closer whatever end government is; similar company going business. first ones know always workers do, stop caring worry much copy paper promotional crap get door without anyone noticing. Especially since perfectly legal pay taxes owe. really wanted pay taxes could just... it. AAP recommendation fine, editorializing expanding recommendation something not. recommendation open schools places COVID control. recommendation schools open full capacity 5 days week. acceptance ""have live virus."" Hard hit areas need get virus control putting kids teachers risk. Systems physical capacity maintain proper social distancing implement kind hybrid system spread students protect teachers. Good luck.

Information evolves novel virus. lying get better information time adjust recommendations accordingly. fact, one hallmarks critical thinking.

By wearing mask taking responsibility actions. us right now, faced unprecedented challenge, without many benefits well funded public health system properly functioning government would provide us. Good luck us all! College students whole—not saying aren’t extremely responsible members cohort—are going follow social distancing guidelines go back campus parents around. young people weren’t wired reckless socializing, human race wouldn’t died long ago.

ETA: meant, Bro...
😂😂😂 Yeah. I’m teacher NYC 14 22 families fled city March. They’re spread Maine Florida (and Israel Korea). MANY families school FL. ppl stayed gotten control mass exodus. families returning school opens. We’re good place future guaranteed. true would turn everything around go back normal. Still skeptical. bad Redfield didn’t follow advice back March. Isn’t strike constitutional right? (Not American, asking) Stop carping name can’t find link, absurd news item months ago someone senior US government, maybe deputy director CDC, complaining John Hopkins Coronavirus tracker down.

Birx also using Worldometer....

BUT states hiding deaths pneumonia, bypassing CDC could help cover up. Fenofibrate (brand names Lipofen, Tricor, Triglide) used US control cholesterol.  likely lot people already take 

Any mention prophylactic effect? Could regular cholesterol control dose effect preventing infection? disrespect Chris Harrison. educated well-informed citizens care greater good. America. crabs bucket. fine Lol. hysteria. Texas fine. Yes, probably made case numbers.

Two things seemed early days pandemic:

1. **It fit sigmoid curve almost perfectly.** Compare countries, would fluctuations numbers weekend testing capacity, would wonder actually got smooth curve reality, churn something Excel. 
2. **April 17, added exactly 50% deaths death toll.** time, Europe Italy particular going spike deaths. China numbers looked low, \*poof\*, add deaths record. 

Right though? probably different story.

They disease control part. longer lockdowns cities allowing people take masks.

What true number is, one knows. entirely sure Chinese government knows exactly, maybe do, even Western countries testing capacity limited point maybe 9 10 people tested actually positive. think serious. 

Anti-vaxxers, unless medically excused, stay home agree get vaccinated. covid diminish severity Covid, either underreporting deaths saying need mask, faster justify reopening businesses. economy tanks November, Trump Looking photographs, what's investigate? ""LOCK UP!"" confirm NY/NJ recruiting nurses doctors state. Offering serious money.  Woooo. Fellow new jerseyians! Stock piles low they've transferred private sector companies owned Trump cronies let capitalism distribute stockpile efficiently.

See federal governments job replace market goods, therefore states must competitively bid profit Trump cronies make America great again. Thank YOU. irony/hypocrisy pretty sickening, course makes trying responsible look become overshadowed headlines governors around world people think Texans like that. half think pushed rule create big hullabaloo rally base. retraction won’t get airplay. Trump MO. Talk big game, grab headlines, realty nothing. barbecue ass. care quarantines  Yeah, long stay possible ADE? 2020, all... Yup Probably kinda case waving big stick hoping scares Wear 2 masks! think ""exact title"" [florida] would work. Wait, really? Source? I'm aware human data Oxford vaccine.  suspect one would eat Limbaugh, even money. never rid taste. saying proves masks work infection rate.

I'm pointing prove point many refused testing option refuse it.

This study prove much anything. 

I would wear mask acting assumption may work. study bearing that, either way.

No one use masks excuse avoid social distancing. necessary. includes avoiding hairstylists awhile, social distancing hair styling mix. Thank you! edited comment. Here's proper link began pandemic response president calling virus chinese hoax.

We doomed start. Big Gretch!

Love woman! Also resign = unemployment saw list long ago local MAGA owned small businesses. circulated FB screenshots proof words caveat emptor Well theres federal response, local response, gives fuck honestly. virus never go away united states government nothing fix problem. Incredible! rando liberal wrote refutation line thinking, using example, 17 years ago.

""The stoical endurance Donner party face almost unimaginable suffering indeed moving. perseverance survivors lasting testament endurance human spirit. (On hand, deaths stoically refused cannibalize fellows might deemed equal, perhaps greater testament.) means obvious – demonstration would seem order – lawmakers formulators public policy therefore make concerted efforts emulate Donner’s dire circumstances. bumper-stickers say? “It’s economy, stupid! need bury ten twelve feet snow forced cannibalize dead generally objects moral edification future generations.”"" locals posting numbers fake. That's declared PHEIC end January Pandemic March. Pandemic discouraged public health agencies across world take admission ""it's everywhere already, nothing done"".

PHEIC urgency Pandemic anyway. don’t believe article says either. says 60% new cases millennials gen z, nothing hospitalization rates. would shocked 60% hospitalizations age group 1% hospitalization rate. went UGA. 

The downtown/party scene pretty much like Mardi Gras every single week. 

The frat bros probably biggest group mass idiots I've ever seen entire life. know system works balance. people cant/refuse work get aid... aid called welfare unemployment benefits.

""Be brave. Try it. like it."" Load shite. Every store I've everyone wear masks

If everyone breaking rules lockdown working?

Yes Scotland large area unpopulated land area populated 70%of population pretty densely populated schools actually far worse appears. sky high positivity rate tests low testing per capita compared positivity rate. estimate US cases ten times reported amount 156 tests per 100k per day positivity rate 6.28. Brazil 32 tests per 100k per day positivity rate 33.2 percent. wonder many hidden cases per official case US ten second important thing they're needs done, they're ones it. They're going charge hospitals patients, they're going sell governments given free patients.  wait it... Hi! made post possible way solve utterly tragic situation, hometown forum! consideration: 

 many cops? 1-on-1 woman vs man? can't really blame cop here, dude already killed someone. Everyone CDC immediately resign. There’s point CDC without data Trump repeatedly politicized censured data personal ends. Time Fauci free delusion good system throughly President Trump’s. Fauci CDC complicit. Try again? Citing wiki page something middle schoolers learn 😂😂😂. Nice try, though. high school dropout trying lecture (I medical degree) healthcare virology comical. Northerners heading South crowded places without masks maybe? two kids getting screwed this. One special needs especially going hurting it. Regular school offered live I'm sending 8 hours week person school. High risk low reward. Well needs go top front page. Don’t answer question question next time, make look incompetent. sounds like easy problem solve end: lock students' account prevent usage anyone else. Place big sticker engraving back saying 'Property &lt;school FUNCTION WITHOUT STUDENTS' CREDENTIALS!'. Apple something like looted iPhones last month, saw people showing Instagram. mean northerners worked together lower cases like Massachusettes? makes sense ;) sure sort average uses well applications.

Furthermore, players place ""Braun Llama Dome"" arcology city went UGA never went football game. People really upset this. shitty grammar essentially proves left college without ability communicate, mentioned original post.

QED. we're talking. think pandemic may short term solution long term problems. boggles mind argument. get wanting reopen businesses get whiney morons complaining wear bit fabric faces indoors public. double jeopardy, we’re fine. watch people read headline start brutalizing llamas search protection Yup.  global health organization designed make things better. Oh wait...  Imagine killing 77 year old grandpa mask.  I'm pretty sure US law something similar, rule meaningless millions decide believe know better.

Reasonable law nothing without reasonable people. ""oops mean commit ethnic cleansing people can't afford healthcare""  riddle this, would government gain it, though? Especially since laughing wearing masks red side, I'd assume. UHHHHHH, South area virtually economic activity (outside Texas)/tourism relative North resulted virus arriving later date. nothing policy-wise South done since virus began deserves even slightest praise. US spiraling insanity. Yes, absolutely. people currently wear masks wear long necessary. time ever real vacation went Amsterdam week. Amsterdam fun, real blast got started taking train smaller villages. Delft church made think Warhammer bit! could kill Chocomel fries mayonnaise right now.

I would love part EU took me. Gov Douche right [Lord think AZ going run tests; able keep up.

We know testing causes Covid; “*So, said people: Slow testing down, please”*

**EDIT:** Jokes aside really hope Ducey bows pressure changes policies soon. see (and Abbott) caving pressure; DeSantis deny matter what. *Daily Challenge Complete* It’s tough swinger days eh RuGgEd InDiViDuaLiSm muh constitutional rights! Nicolas Cage national treasure.

Like movie. Spaceballs. study done showing kids less likely contract covid adults do. Rate contraction kids super low. thing worry teachers, school follow cdc guidelines contraction rates lowered. Even kid meet 3 days pre week it’s better nothing. Don’t forget meal plan daycare.. population bunch rich people... people minimum wage need meal program feed kids act daycare. lot people jobs, schools reopened crucial... pro opening schools heavy cons... first stabbing victim still alive. Hospitalized. Happened town. way go out. sentiments exactly. Bored, work home, see people go food medical appointments. Even video calls. lonely look forward business meeting phone talk another person. extremely pissed morons refuse wear mask. Making pandemic keep going. Plus lack help feds fuckup never seen before. read going vacation actions help pandemic taken. Nice job senators representatives. Yep. Yersinia pestis also rats, dog mouths, etc. treatment simple established, reason alarmed unless you’ve somehow traveled back time antibiotics.

Edit: downvoted wtf? People really hating science days. Yea, especially southern states, like Florida, Texas, Alabama. Even areas low federal funding, significant state funding kind. state telling reopen, really choice So, ok eat it? Usually it’s 2 tests rule contagiousness think past 19 days you’re longer contagious even still symptoms making run time soon reasons know well received anyways. get frustrated work COVID response getting defeating get deeper pandemic. say communication tools, networks, even funding easily get things control. lack solid leadership inability community work together making everything much worse. symptoms massive systemic problem brewing long time. Union busting parasitic ghoul can’t grasp concept observing learning mistakes victories Aaaaaaand, hope open schools.

Speaking of, Israel opened schools May. went ~1k cases month ~1k cases day now. empirical evidence bad idea, winds 10-14yo's frequently asymptomatic spreaders.

So mystery what's going happen. extrapolating we've seen far. places done exact thing we're talking disaster. Lol tell aren’t serious wearing mask rock climbing wilderness alone 😂 Best Buy made many changes adapt Amazon world well turned around freaking flawed many levels. boils to, consider lives worthy not. not, you’re worshipper destruction nobody needs right now. followed except didn’t, don’t see?! Like vegan eats meat meal times. parents’ quarantine got back Florida two weeks ago went everywhere would gone otherwise (except house they’re allowed!) Yes, certainly alot know; unfortuantely extrapolating data asymptomatic cases likely take quite time fully analyze pull relevant conclusions without falsely attributing causation correlation. long wait collect data deciding path great speculation medical community.

As E-learning, agree, certainly significant potential. Unfortunately situation school systems underfunded, technologically impaired, quite ready expediant jump forced make 21st century. certainly driving force pushing schools adopt modern technology, exactly bad thing. Likewise, societal standpoint, would need large reform accomodate home e-learning, likely happen quickly afraid Praise llamas “All countries...except these” countries lol, don’t get wrong response terrible one arguing that, quite Ok? Florida’s peak hasn’t even started. Give two weeks. Yep that’s straight bullshit. mainstream sub can’t anger sponsors ! Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* pretty easy control spread live somewhere without much population density. Social distancing kind comes naturally, lot effective controlling spread mask wearing crowds. worse... Obama Boomer. got nothing age/generation. Oh fixed that. document reads ""facemasks EXPECTED"" Like US learned school shootings? *nervous laughter* might surprise you, LOT parents want schools open nonpolitical reasons.

I'm saying agree it, saying Republican politicians pushing true. Every single country prioritized reopening schools. tuition $$$... would think deathbed would make want marginally better person, guess not. recent advice state Australia second wave wear mask areas social distancing easy like indoors shop. limits number people store obviously it’s always easy. said don’t level contagion death believe supply issues. wear mask anyone within 10 metres otherwise I’m bothering. CA, Florida going get worse even NYC though, gotten already.

A perfect time Disney World open Wearing mask protect others. much protect yourself. everyone it, crisis resolved matter weeks. like Europe. Arizona one got me.  said, BC getting ~20 day.  population 2 million shy theirs. 

I know there's factors play besides population, jesus christ, eye opener.  You’re god damned psychopath dangerous country. sooner people like gone, better we’ll be. Get actual science critical thinking education love things decent (which currently include you). FHM going bring deaths per million down? Resurrection? That's proper study diverse environments would nice. also consider we're probably looking *minuscule* exposure amount particles outdoor environment breeze. Like lighting one kids smoke bomb fireworks (as extreme example). much smoke actually *linger* outdoors? blows away quickly. imagine need breathe dense smoke portion order infected. Simply smelling residue air enough.  
 
Of course, know much enough, thus precautions. I'm pointing difference lighting smoke bomb outdoors versus indoors. know concentration huge impact person's infection rate. simply outdoors FAR safer even everyone wearing masks inside. Good ventilation inside would also key. seems pretty straightforward me. Again, I'd love see data it. point [this Japanese show quickly micro-droplets disperse airflow introduced. 
 
In addition, particles outdoors never become concentrated again. continue thin atmosphere extremely small levels becomes inconsequential. also question long virus survive direct indirect sunlight. think theory cumulative precedent levels we'd see outdoors. 
 
Getting back smoke bomb example. argument could made two people represented smoke bombs passed trail sidewalk, chance breathing enough particles get infected. makes perfect sense wear mask situation. There's also question wind direction... zero chance particles travel up-wind. maybe person downwind you? Things consider.  
 
Bottom line wearing masks often possible, let's also rationalize things getting upset others wearing mask outdoors, especially coming withing 6ft people. submission removed because

Oh wait... Dr. Fauci, like you. happen; damn late. cared enough post, said accurate, although I'm sure intention. know believe.

Basically every epidemiologist ever guy high school flunked community college spams Infowars links Facebook day long?

It's confusing. Presidential Medal Freedom winner material right there! scary watching what's going US. ya know..there's lot normal people support trump..it's inbred hicks media show :/ ges Fauci's approval 65+%. Orange ones around 39%. Lots senators tight races going try unkiss ring. Also trying discredit Fauci. disagree. DoD school kid since Dad army, got go school base enough times notice difference. Went back extended relatives Idaho kiddos. youngest first grade wanted give better chance future moved Minnesota. 

The public school go still amazes 3 years later. It’s really night day. Everyone takes granted thinks understand bad elsewhere idea. Similarly plenty people back home simply don’t believe I’m exaggerating stuff say true.

I say cases number teachers care effort put equal. It’s support receive makes difference. 

Though DoDs teachers overseas still favorite. kinds badass stuff knew could get away it, really cared wouldn’t working difficult position. Lol except death spiral happens would expect go back down. 

You little blip went right back down.

No one said couple hundred people wouldn’t die. 

Where huge spike.

How many days want come back get apology.

I didn’t cherry pick anything picked last three days since spoke lolololol

It’s gone since up.

When lie deaths people stop listening comes side effects. I've talking science department, dep chairs. think schools open, seriously considering taking year leave absence. HVAC school recycles air, get Covid. would first. elections always grabs whoever gets couch. what?   animal save us, it’s llamas. Donald trump made virus political. cant ban political speech point. Shit they’re even wearing analyzed something realized made mistake changed it? Staying indoors day though. Data matters. informs decision making. don’t agree doesn’t make less true. Exactly. media always chooses dumbest quote headline. “Yeah know didn’t wear mask, maybe next time” US pandemic plan could prepared plan dismantled... decision get doctorate going pay off. ignorance, maybe arrogance CDC, medical field government ignore science, discoveries protocols nations. Asia around sick people wear mask. SK better testing use it. every country thinks safe sees reason lockdown goes like nothing happening numbers explode. Can’t Corona us world! We’re number one! mean ventilators, respirators. think takes roughly 15-30 days start see reflected numbers. next 5-20 days informative. long take schedule PCR test get results? Half day 

How long America? 12 days likely wouldn’t done way See’m technology (that paper 2002 use CRISPR/Cas9 far lower cost higher accuracy)

CRISPR/Cas9 may far lower cost higher accuracy compared See'm, however, technologies appear capability hide sequence ever manipulated like Seem'm does. want hide manipulation, would use technology it? 

The reason brought See'm technology one biggest argument lab origin mentioned article premise: virus genetically engineered lab would signs manipulation genome data. would include evidence existing viral sequence backbone new virus, obvious, targeted inserted (or deleted) genetic evidence exists. unlikely techniques used genetically engineer virus would leave genetic signature, like specific identifiable pieces DNA code.*

I'm necessarily saying used See'm, possibility, important acknowledge technology hide DNA manipulations. original article saying, clear original sequence virus appears altered (called backbone) strange looking insertions/deletions sequence.

There strange looking insertion sequence. read article linked: obvious chimera (though nesessarily lab-made one), based ancestral bat strain RaTG13, receptor binding motif (RBM) spike protein replaced RBM pangolin strain, addition, __a small special stretch 4 amino acids inserted__, creates furin cleavage site that, virologists previously established, significantly expands “repertoire” virus terms whose cells now, series strange coincidences — example, outbreak Yunnan coronavirus occurred thousands kilometers Yunnan wet market closest Wuhan Institute Virology. maybe wet market, 3 first 4 patients ties market. Plus, coincidences structural features CoV2 genome, resemble manipulations virologists repeatedly carried lab. coincidence coincidences happen, CoV2 could obviously arisen naturally. yet clear exactly — this, __the bat pangolin strains must met cell animal Wuhan, since outbreak occurred (otherwise would seen outbreaks along path animal would taken get Wuhan). Given bats sold Wuhan market, generally hibernate time year, carriers ancestral strains yet identified, exact scenario natural emergence remains opposite side balance, giving credence lab hypothesis, reports 2018, American experts quite alarmed visit Wuhan Institute Virology conversation Shi Zhengli. “lab tour” resulted two diplomatic dispatches Washington noted number safety us turn attention back virus itself. __Does obvious signs lab manipulation? First, words “obvious” means. mutation arise naturally, even amino acid insert created furin site CoV2 “PRRA” “MADEINWVHANPRRA”, would still non-zero chance arose accident. us, court, think would enough prove lab origin beyond reasonable main problem evidence even lab-made virus simply may exist. Basically, good genetic engineer create synthetic virus would indistinguishable natural one. Moreover, often researchers deliberately introduce synonymous mutations designs later discern strain natural ones. creators choose reveal markers, impossible distinguish natural sometimes traces manipulation may remain, especially creators try hide them.* Let go teach 36 kids two weeks classroom. Masks kill people saves virus... Economy first society second. society wiped lease economy! understand.. protests deemed significant source infection, can't parades/concerts/large outdoor events too? Hmm... think decision would less “coronavirus concerns” “reelection concerns”. Trump gotten lot bad press (as should!) hosting large indoor rallies doesn’t surprise thinking ways preventing virus overshadowing coverage convention. even saying? love job, tons people wherewithal put career path they'll enjoy. *make New Mexico pay it. :) BS ""Can get another Amen"" Central Valley?

The guy r n k n g  c f f e e . respectfully disagree. vaccines take years develop, also develop vaccines annually. flu vaccine brand new, every year, deployed 160 million Americans, every year, actually 5 vaccines different strains flu single shot, rather single vaccine.

Obviously mechanics covid-19 different. coronavirus, normally vaccinate for, lot scientific understanding already. may take another year develop vaccine it, mechanism producing vaccine likely reliable, well tested, experienced supply chain used today flu vaccine. 

I first line, least close front get without causing scene. refuse shutdowns getting even flack. “There’s blood hands”, say. multiple local news articles reported today basically bullshit FYI.

What fucking douchecanoe. Covid infection rates would say otherwise. Selfishness exists human populations, US taken whole level. actual fuck.

What. The. Fuck.

Sigh, I'm coming sub anymore. Shit depressing demoralizing. RIP remaining semblance accurate numbers. everywhere Texas. don’t know it’s due education analytical person feel like someone provided facts information well evidence, views stances things would change tempered feel like empirical data would hard refute we're going stuck propose least stick Borden Island. keep isolated. Honest question. everyone gets vaccinated one person chooses to, put anyone risk besides person choosing to? would great place vodka shots - would feel like Siberia date numbers 22% = 520 empty, staffed ICU beds. additionally 904 ""unreported, reported unstaffed beds"" could empty, could unstaffed, could date info want know more! Georgia common wait long understand article cited specifically says, ""Although studies don’t clarify whether people clear SARS-CoV-2 infection ward virus future...""

And even partial immunity someone gets less severe case, precisely problem virus spreading right now. Mild cases going undetected leading outbreaks.

I'm hopeful vaccines look like causing significantly stronger immune responses naturally acquired COVID cases, meaning long run beat thing. fear without widely distributed vaccines going reach state risk populations really go public without concern. someone lived New England 20+ years...every town NH small town. guess 99.95% us. ...[and like that, streak could Health officials said one cases announced Tuesday passenger WestJet flight travelled Winnipeg flights WestJet 261 left Winnipeg June 27 WestJet flight 526 Calgary Winnipeg July According province, affected rows flight 261 rows seven 22. affected rows flight 526 rows four People flights told self-monitor symptoms, develop, self-isolate contact Health Links use online screening tool. Wait NFL get involves say, ""No can't that"" last 60 plus days lost 30%.

The Russian government made 200-IQ move implementing laws requiring masks public spaces (stores + public transportation). ""totalitarian Russian police-state"" made absolutely effort enforce pandemic laws result nobody gives single flying fuck social distancing mask laws, never enforced, served lip service 100 million dumb human-shaped animals started ignoring pandemic more. Right now, would say 20-40 % people wear sort mask face cover public (ideally supposed wear gloves well, theory stores would face massive fines even single customer follow laws).

After time, really becomes comical hearing PSAs radio everyone wear masks, signs everywhere saying customers kicked wearing mask, lines drawn floor 1.5 meters apart telling people keep distance, everyone ignores cram together like farm animals unventilated spaces. Frankly, I'm surprised happy cases doubling every week given fucking stupid irresponsible many people are.  sounds like ""it's uncomfortable"" causes medical problem. wife severe asthma carries rescue inhaler; asthmatic friends. wear masks problem. really appreciate wear covering though! Younger demographics driving current infection surge. clear data (over 50% infected 44 years old. Almost 40% 34).

Looked r/conservative, hell?? Every single post front page complaining snowflakes, Liberals, black people. framework already place. Want play youth sports? show birth certificate. would show birth certificate provide vaccination record number (VRN). Want job? Proof work eligibility (citizenship) already required, provide VRN well. isn’t forcing unvaccinated people things, letting new things without proof vaccination.

Ever seen original Death Race? wheelchair scene hysterical I'm guessing stays closed least end 2020. America likely get act together there's different President, point still take months. Yeah. caved right that. really frustrating. Initial ban gatherings 11th March - 500 people 50 people 27th March. dates first recommended visiting elderly homes made full ban. restrictions bars restaurants able provide table service need provide enough distancing also introduced 24th March. no. measures since March. time though, leaving unchecked/unrivaled allowed numbers grow.

These tests almost completely useless information point. Sure, I'd like know COVID 9 days ago (got work), maybe now. maybe now. Welp. I'm glad see we're ok sacrificing teachers staff rather change things semester. 

Adults wear masks. earth expect schools safe? informed beforehand may get placebo instead vaccine told getting, consent that. 2001-2008 nothing MMORPG fonding time life tho. numbers entire state, Boston. wrong, Florida's population like 3x Mass. article lists one Canadian citizen, kick one out?  automods crazy. appeal, real mods say can't find post moderated. send link, get response days, point matter re-instate post not. mods overwhelmed sub way heads. need another 200 mods going reports keep automod line.

Screw you, calling bunch Indians killed ancestors savages isn’t racist. stating fact. Go somewhere else cancel culture BS. possible. would right end October election coming up.

Pretty sure Canada would say though. Cases likely spiking around time. There's door. I’m sure unions there.  I’m teacher NC don’t one. don’t know do. I’m high risk need health insurance life saving meds — go work risking life don’t lose insurance risks life?? live free, die free. Yep.

Sounds familiar. Moral high grounding work me. 
Something something something stop shoving people's throats? I'm betting like end countries fifth human species You’re drinking Kool-Aid aren’t ya? Cram walnuts black lightbulbs, ugly. even think this. how? think we’re little lost semantics here, isn’t much difference, except quarantine order ought objective application, otherwise legitimacy order risk. governor protecting one’s state obviously well-intentioned matter what, decisions made logical way, singling one place logical way applying blanket quarantine applying specific set criteria outside travelers, may may meet criteria might be.

Regardless, also think may get impression I’m trying shoot RI’s quarantine order - I’m absolutely not, think it’s important tool battling pandemic, I’m sincerely glad Rhode Island order place April - APRIL! places still hadn’t even enacted stay home orders residents point.

You seem really disagree one thing: still take issue said NY state experiencing outbreak region time. It’s patently untrue. NJ Boston metro terrible shape exactly time NYC, absolutely read past comment dismisses happened anything utter tragedy. everything happens election year pertain election? believe every country planet cares enough elections skew optics pandemic?

Bill Gates massively wealthy philanthropist fairly long history advocating funding medical advancement.

The US economic ties China decades.

There haven’t continued bans quarantines; one half assed one, caused infection death rates drop, cases spiking idea revisited. 

Numbers skewed time, doesn’t mean throw statistically relevant data. 

Everyone questions things day every day they’re thinking critically, healthy skepticism required functioning democracy. 

There haven’t riots, large peaceful protests, occurring reason (institutionalized racism) since 60s.

I certainly agree there’s air divide conquer, believe you’re misplacing blame. Instead disregarding trained professionals whole cloth, maybe ask politicians making claims public health first place. politicians elected officials go authority literally everything, instead people worked subjects career? Partly deaths lagged behind every indicator also partly 20-30 age group getting spreading point.. if/when 20-30 age group spreads older people gonna real trouble death rate spiking again. may see small uptick deaths weeks due current trends infection biggest risk 20-30 yr olds long term damage spreading people love.

With states lack response DUE age demographic getting infected likely matter time get exponential growth susceptible portions population huge uptick deaths would bring. likely small uptick deaths weeks due current infections.. big death numbers 6+ weeks longer spread next group. agree pretty much saying hundreds doctors lying governor state. even vaccines 100% effective. One year flu vaccine 28% effective iirc. I'll continue get flu shot though that's protection otherwise. People got flu shot even tended less severe symptoms shorter illnesses.

Even masks 20% effective stopping spread that's substantially less cases helps everyone. Worst case little uncomfortable wear it, best case help slow spread. I'm arguing effectiveness masks agree they're good dude issue forced masks
And great cali werent also nyc uptick spread guys much already
And what's wrong calling rioters rioters we've much destruction caused people.  feel awful going friend’s father’s funeral week I’ve known 20 years would going hot spot state many elderly people would there. Remember hundreds thousands protesters marched city close quarters? Yes, aware. much common Spanish Flu. made Spanish Flu nasty, risk group majority population. Tx surging right now, hey, school reopen. fine awesome news Chi Town baby, hope visit fam someday sooner later. People expecting POTUS lead means getting governors page despite issues may other.  Instead Trump pitting states fuck anyone.  need unified pandemic response even require violating oh sacred states rights. requires leadership.

What Trump country 100% genocide people every right call it. Damn. burn LOL. love people create realities reddit. Somehow comment people needing school session parents choice work turned personally entitled person using public school daycare young child turned needing daycare. That’s particular situation even remotely. 

If among large percentage families can’t work home, either draft grandparent , remove necessary income, hire person look children remote learning. leave home alone day hope best. That’s addition paying property taxes pay teachers, buses buildings can’t use. 

Every parent spoke middle elementary school thought online learning disaster. can’t put first grader front computer alone expect good result go work single parent. 

I know parents can’t spare $40 forget hiring full time nanny taking year off. Imagine poor person needing government’s services taxes paying shamed redditors rich enough keep kids home day accepting lousy education year. It’s outrageous. Rich people don’t put crap. people say benefit status quo. know violence *exactly* takes. I’d like see DeVos try keep class 30 kindergarten children six feet apart keep mask on. Maybe that’ll change mind education system. maybe there’s much money clogging ears. asked compare did. estimate based confirmed cases. goes confirmed deaths. figures don’t include Covid related deaths unaccounted for. logic would suggest cherry picking.

Let’s return true figures become clear confirm definitely isn’t deadly common flu. meantime, actually something support claim I’d happy read share it.

As attempts sow fear, suggest motives that? Would interesting understand angle is. Mondays normally low day. need COVID protests Completely agree . Trump wants everyone back schools work “ herd” mentality . Ugh Flu pneumonia death numbers pretty much tripled. There's possibility. sayin worse February weak leadership attribute insanity. Fuck whataboutism bullshit GOP really intent getting many Americans killed possible.

Can't voted Voters dead, right?

this didnt happen elsehwere? respectfully disagree . live New York hike Adirondacks frequently . need wear mask hiking abiding rules social distancing.

It heartbreaking kids, especially class one past years. kids really struggled it, plan almost weekly activities like spirit days remembrance walks rest year, December June, help move grief. saw kids wearing ribbon made even throughout following year. many them, first time experiencing death someone close to. Teachers hold special place child's heart. Six hours day, five days week....that's even awake/active time spend parents. Teachers difficult joyful experiences they've thus far. even show it, every young kid wants please teacher.  

Now, think happens another teacher dies, time kids feel guilty? Like probably caused it. happen, question many times. know they'll test kids, positive, they'll KNOW. Kids already blame adverse life experiences, deaths abuse divorce, even rational, nearly impossible convince ""it fault"", even wasn't.  

The argument keep hearing teachers shoulder risk ""for benefit kids...."", see putting kind baggage kids healthy either. Knowing could well risk teacher's life. 

Maybe I'm thinking it.  think lot room drop premium price point worth it. $400 Million reportedly inherited would worth nearly $10 Billion today invested stock market. Forbes net worth $2.1 Billion many reports said he's worth less $1 Billion:

Maybe try arguing ideas facts instead condescending douche bag all, think agree dressed....badly photo. live Canada, we’re 1300 active cases falling, 4 deaths per day. Ontario population 14 million. 

We’re ready reopen economy, done hard work get there. basically stuck homes 2.5 months — number $1000 fines levied things like 2 people playing basketball park — weeks gradual reopening. 

The US like spoiled child. best way rebounding economy actually beat virus back... push small number. There’s economy vs lives choice — don’t control deaths exponential growth model, economy collapse fear. Eventually, strategy inflate stock market going fail, there’s going hell pay does.

2nd spoiler: going keep going idiots protesting wearing masks sister ft worth still insists even San Antonio, Houston even Dallas get overwhelmed, Tarrant county much better handling things prepared area fine.

And anyways hospitals counting deaths covid, numbers super exaggerated. daily occurrence students forced back school next month. is. He's uneducated piece fucking garbage.

We dont go outdoor bars patios. buy essential groceries, wear masks everywhere, avoid crowds, avoid people. 

it sucks done. President sent message pretty loud clear. think needed help protests. Hey man go flow.. think everything.. else got do? I’ve home 5 months... really worried either way... order turn tide increasing cases, need 100%. need get transmission rates R0=1. wear mask public - protect everyone, like seatbelts stop car crash deaths, make big enough difference. know, expect Rock Braun Strowman would still make better presidents. hate professional wrestlers. guns blazing safety guess June 13, 26-year-old University staff member Rebekah Jones booked one count battery police officer, one count remaining forbidden two counts resisting arrest, Scott said.

That's one day, buying multiple days drastically lowers price. Prioritizing economy. states argue federal gov cant control them. messy. lot blame.

People leave house without masks deserve blame too. need gov tell go crowded beaches without masks pandemic. mean, largest populated states California, Texas, Florida, New York. (in order). That's 2 2. Republicans control way states, though. sub joke downvoting comment. freaked weeks barber Michigan giving haircuts. freak beach party. comes mass protesting across country groups thousands people huddled together weeks shouting others faces, well, way could reason covid spiking again

They want people treat COVID utmost seriousness picking choosing activities OK due politics doesnt help ALL

The mass protesting OBVIOUSLY #1 reason ""Second wave"" Wow...yeah kinda see lol. I've never heard before, checks out.  Here's deal, point kick COVID one way another.

There's guarantee that. thing works, significantly lowers rate transmission lockdown. necessary save many lives possible instead letting people sacrificed vain hope ""at point kick COVID."" yes, means lot shit coming back.

Every protest probably 99% mask-wearing rate. understood responsibility. morons believe masks, yet fact daily protests NYC large uptick (because everyone wore mask) kinda shows work.

As far rioters, people guys talk that? Damn. American hero! mom suffers asthma 60 year old woman home healthcare business bet wears mask.

Just people unwilling face ignorance lack empathy. many countries prepared. first go something like this. ready next one  non-Utahns, us family friends Utah translate headline you: Utahns refusing wear masks stores risk getting closed outbreak occurs getting desperate. cannot require customers wear masks, hoping free stuff trick would true everyone equally susceptible, states handled things way, new lockdown measures taken (and they're obviously coming back hot spots).

I surprised US South infected though. Sadly, experimented people's lives health. However, fair him, without federal funding support he's rock hard place. good thing new york new jersey handled whole situation much better Jesus... get perspective. Black Death killed 40-50% population Europe, young old.

With exponential growth situation changes daily basis. might ""safe"" open now, month rate.  Texas, populace known earth common sense people, infact exact opposite. also testing shit.

That tells people wanting buy whatever reason government subsidizing clinics able afford them. also mention expensive ($500 PCR test test 60 samples/test, $500 antigen test test ~90 samples/test). 
 
So yeah, take will, collective capacity test way US, not. isn't, %500 increase pneumonia related deaths, guess what...that's pneumonia! That's fucking COVID, that's one main ways kills people, they're hiding numbers! Nothing else explain %500 pneumonia death increase, ESPECIALLY happening many places.
Mexico actually exact thing keep numbers down. nothing Toulouse admitting still helps. ~30% people can’t get infected slow rate transmission Miami 1 39 people infected. Insane, last week 1 50 people. Won’t enforce restrictions, happy tear gas beat shit anyone want. feel like biggest contributing factor early reopening, lack actual regulation around mask use social distancing. properly implemented, US (and residing there) actually managed enforce amount reasonable social distancing mask use, numbers even gotten close are, hospitals would nearly overwhelmed. course, HUGE issues US medical system regarding misallocation incompetence part federal state governments, root problem restrictions applied long enough strictly enough us see cases go manageable state. blaring problems US healthcare system, yes. problems addressed appropriately fixed. can't however ignore fact blame lies 3 places: incompetent federal government, incompetent state governments, incompetent Americans.

The video informative. video provide four examples total. background quickly scroll page page labs, none reporting anything close 100% appear around average. blur background completely leaving us evidence four labs accidentally reported 100% positive results. far cry ""countless"" headline, fact easy count.

The kicker, makes click bait headline, every lab called admitted mistake provided reporter accurate percentage.

We sit around wait couple months see catches virus randomly based normal day day basis.

Many problems going created asymptomatic cases etc...

They saying instead that, give 30,000 people vaccine, Wait week two, intentionally expose Coronavirus see catch it.

This would significantly speed trial would get clear results works not. would probably people mingle people covid positive something. Thanks :)

I’ll make filters this. 

Pretty worried getting second time...it’s scary virus. Trump admin playing marketing Fauci trying save us ourselves.  theory movie definitely holds true.

I course didn’t first child last year age 37.  “Oi da piece papuh says can’t save ourselves”

When say need national mask mandate? answer never said that. Sorry.

 think great idea though, people clearly won’t listen public health officials suggestions. Also quote specific law policy stating mask mandate would illegal? 

You’re nutjob asked “number science” backed policy despite number science backed policy wear mask stay distant. They’ve less telling us need do, think majority no-maskers lockdown protestors hoping solution doesn’t inconvenience them, I’m afraid won’t exist while. people call us Nordic countries socialist hellholes... Darn glad born one socialist hellholes. Well...I guess didn’t shutdown flu even ""*opporating costs unchanged*"" like many Universities say, fact offer online value. need adjust pricing Maybe pikachus come Disney world?! lot people can't afford nice shit either that's catch-22 whole situation: implement best possible response minimize cases deaths, impossible prove even necessary. opposition yell top lungs unnecessary fear mongering.

The best case things would turned like Y2K, turned big deal generated lot criticism media overhyped potential catastrophe. 

Of course, narrative ignored massive amount work went making sure Y2K big deal. Governor Murphy NJ took heavy action, gym tried opening ago even though measures place, Murphy shut every day orders fines. pausing phase 2 bc people getting lax beaches bars, doubt roll back necessary. trust Governor though, he's causes focused data. first group heading hospitals San Antonio Houston, four locations Texas still determined. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott expected put statement soon new deployments.

What's over-under admitting wrong instituting another lockdown vs begging government assistance continuing nothing? making sense. emotions blurred ability reason. man I'm confused people obsessed told recovery rates. 1. We're told many people dying. Presumably, dying they're recovering. 2. thing takes forever recover from. mild case leave feeling like shit three weeks, effects still go weeks that. Recovery numbers going slow. People seem get better suddenly get worse die. 3. even know recovery looks like point? thought respiratory illness. signs pointing multi-system vascular illness. could horrible long-term effects know yet. suspect! Recovery could look like remission later resurgence. could organ damage greatly reduces life-span, like Scarlet Fever.

How's doom gloom?

I still want honest answers what's going here. make think things hunky dory they're not. Ok find evidence doctors think virus overblown (and there). mean need accept overblown? bot reposting existing comments threads farm karma/look legitimate. Report it. Florida wants number one, even higher numbers America that’s way real American. Hopefully better job time. never symptoms tbh even symptoms mild, would want risk common cold contracting coronavius getting screened, obviously would high risk environment. ignorance, stupidity.

Furthermore, i'd like advice read expotential growth. hope learn something.

And last: we'll talk month so.

RemindMe! 30 days hope get go back college dream! 💓  Kids money likely going White Collar parents going working home, hence likely remote learn. Poor kids whose parents work jobs can't done remotely poor internet forced back schools. Orange county pushing, unions cave. ✊ He’s awesome. Glad voted him.

Look, point view nobody likes this. Nobody likes going concerts bar friends. wear mask, get back stuff sooner.

So wear mask want fun sooner. he’s going get re-elected lol Gonna squeaker. still advantages contact tracing. Telling people careful virus working keep interacting. Telling contact someone virus would focus minds. also makes people aware start experiencing symptoms likely get tested self quarantine. harder number cases information actually always going helpful society. Couldn’t social media? personally think reopened saw cases accelerating upside least month ago, shut things right away.

When opened up, (possibly valid time) hope social distancing limited measures might good enough, instant proven false, closed least ramped restrictions numbers decreased again. Ah, yes, remember people tried get going lectures. education mostly reading writing. Trust me. live beach town Rhode Island. state plates CT NY. “big money” houses area Newport arm people New York eastern CT like Darien CT talk like 60% - know true number higher scary long go. Dude plenty scientists saying *IF* vaccine 2021 stop gap even take awhile make enough everyone. said approve efficacy low 50%, great. worst thing mental health tell things like bc happen crushed. totally agree fuck ups like nursing home. horrendous idea. think leaving subway running full capacity good thing least near full capacity (maybe time clean subway cars). limit number subways, subway car become packed. Making easier virus spread person person. need subway system continue operating many people depend essential stuff. Whether go grocery shopping, go doctor, essential work. people went subway non essential reasons. people either working home working all. point going subway everything closed down. Multiple kids underlying issues died. lot died multi inflammatory syndrome like Kawasaki, heart attacks, respiratory failure. arnt immune serious complications. yeah you’re right would necessary unfortunately people aren’t going physically distance wear masks forever. social creatures rely lot facial expression like interact one another. there’s vaccine within like two years mass death Glad lymphoma. sure trying say though. certain probably seen doctor. Might good idea even lymphoma. Asian people wear masks hypochondriacs. courteous spreading diseases possible. called looking fellow human keeping society whole well something US apparently. Florida people brave volunteering control group: well covid spread anything stop it. Dude he's ICU doctor. know fit narrative people would rather believe long they're old fat them, accept point.  8066 Worldometers right now. Please listen random redditors, move here. full dare realistic consistent saying learn code argument. feasable change careers suddenly. getting cashiering job $8 hour massive pay cut would homeless, like said.  every state now. Welcome pandemic Hunger Games. work fast. 2 generations enough allow genetic change. society protects nutures stupidity.  Lol response sounds scared? I’m one thinks life might cut short 20-30 years based zero evidence saying otherwise. We've COVID testing patients April onwards. May time started blur me. I’m middle, near Nashville. Broadway still hopping! Mask mandate enforced. Polis pretty damn good response whole thing since beginning. Glad he’s governor  No. 

I fell Twitter thread prominent R telling everyone numbers Florida made up, it’s hot spread virus. Everyone agreed numbers swing states another attempt “steal election.”

Also thread someone wishing could get chloroquine. said chloroquine incredibly cheap effective government(?) keeping market sell remdesivir, expensive. 

Somehow folks capable turning computer making Twitter account, time brain use. Yes!! TLDR

What already known this? 

Human coronaviruses known cause respiratory re-infections, regardless pre-existing humoural immunity.

There evidence suggesting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) circulating Italy first COVID-19 case detected country.

What new findings?

Prior infections SARS-CoV-2 (or viruses/coronaviruses) may arguably predispose severe forms disease following re-infection SARS-CoV-2, immunological mechanism known Antibody-Dependent-Enhancement, already observed infections sustained coronaviruses (MERS-CoV SARS-CoV) viruses West Nile Virus Dengue. Oh well, need mask let know :) good talking you. Ok. apologize. *am* privileged. parents' lawyer would handled readily school. get now.

You railroaded, nobody pull trigger sue school. games success wide range ages? America freedom. It’ll worse winter even though it’s hot summer plenty people spend time outdoors. winter, much aunt know pandemic going president declared national emergency... saying American, many Americans pay attention anything outside local news. getting week, unit least found ways single mother dual military work out. Getting positions could work home etc. Climate affects virus (the virus dies heat) everyone inside air conditioned buildings, matter. yeah, choice either 3 weeks ""real"" shutdown (like China countries done), many months even years suffering.

We chose wrong. keeps saying everyday one day bound right. today though. amazed americans dumbed last couple decades. amazing country screw badly. win internet! fucking love bullshit. really hate reason I'm staying job b/c insurance. pay good, there's nothing spend money right now, almost non-issue. hate know can't quit b/c administration interested helping country navigate this. feel like freedom slightest. Thanks math, that's came fuck not! *runs google* HOLEEEEE FUUUUUCCCKKKK Sources last bit? Like actual credible sources?

Or think doctors medical professionals wearing masks decades like look them?

And believe medical professionals, basing belief on? refuse believe Trump playing 4D chess supporters claim he’s doing.

A long-term, well-thought-out plan, however nefarious, would require intelligence reasoning/critical thinking skills. governor shut state again, can't speak county county, OC. board meeting tomorrow, I'm assuming we'll follow LA. younger people worried could “silent carriers” unknowingly blood clots risks issues result. I’m kind hypochondriac kind worrying this. dumb? guy would likely fail state Florida reading comprehension basic math assessment tests. choice grifting meth addict scumbag. beard covers even worse chin feel you, grad student (2006-2014) made 13k. Rough. guess maybe thought I'd 70k range prof, got job accessible affordable school I'm proud of, love work at, I'm happy trade off. always funny family confused can't buy plane tickets come see them...sorry folks, make much y'all without college degrees...  

Hang there. Grad school comes end...and hopefully there's job afterward make pain! Yeah! Like time school filled locker vents Hershey's syrup? (am right guys)  sister owns condo live. rents condo thru management company. tenant displeased sister wanted evict them, could owns real estate.
 
If shot school sold drugs bombed library, school could evict school owns apartment building.


The lawsuit would indeed involve management company school (which contracted via management company luring classes never happen person). California real property attorney needed.

P.S.
You forget physics lab, although probably billed too. weeks. Lots news stories past 2 months  Lol, zero, obviously. vote mayor South Lake Tahoe. mayorship goes whoever's turn city council. expectations nil. Obviously every city council member wanted gets elected, inevitably mayors vehemently disagree with. current pushover, Jason Collin. also hold local government lower standards power. 

And fucking showed voted Gavin Newsom. Got trip planned travel UK Germany coming week. Simple question realistically worth risk? roadtrip, airports etc. ofc careful be, wear face mask time anyway, frequent hand washing, carry anti bacterial wipes me. It’s also actually rules lot Germany unlike wear face mask pretty much everywhere, worth it? Yea body remembers viruses, even antibodies disappear like antibodies do, next reoccurrence body ramp production T-cells. Likely much fight body initial, new exposure Slowed now. get second wave. 

But regardless, it’s biggest overreaction everyone. It’s social media pandemic. nothing severe flu, world put future generations work billions debt. really mind bogglingly stupid. Sweden one balanced risks here, see years. next door neighbor 88 years old morning thought locked outside, hot hot day! Fortunately got back hard time figuring keep daughter safe scenario true many countries, alone cant explain Italy got hit hard. can't second wave first wave never ends. chances first wave ending effective vaccine takes care virus slim none. short ago people saying yes case numbers increasing deaths increasing. 

So ICU numbers up, sadly, next step increase deaths.

This predictable China, Iran, Italy New York. man interest whatsoever protect lives people living state. going mass homelessness displacement service industry/retail workers affected this, unemployment expansion ending 2 weeks. Unemployment normally replaces \~50% regular wages. addition commenter said, would like point lab experiments deliberately attempted re-infect recovered primates, none successfully re-infected. Macaque monkeys immune systems similar humans good evidence immunity.  yet allowed weddings 150 people indoors 250 outside. Probably means he's found another way suppress reporting 120k dollars.

Ducey values police ""mental health"" nine dollars.

this **tip** pizza guy gets COVID state **141** law enforcement agencies employing **14,591** sworn police officers, one saying anything though. That's known months since beginning. messed right ? shocking anyone. I've always said Tennessee basically smaller version Texas. put fluoride masks! Lol. Probably vaccinations too, give autism. Health built created series personal choices things prevent long term harm (even means also turning short term immediately gratifying benefits, like fast food some, going parties without masks others) majority average residents USA make priority. 

If prioritized health preventive care, would lead things like obesity, maternal risk birth, COVID infections - among many others. stats available make clear. Priorities change USA nothing change better here. NY governor decides state does. CA? county county? general, hospitalizations people 30 still anomaly within demographic. may gone hospital precaution. like playing Russian roulette - people come fine, want 1% young people end bearing brunt it? Universal too. It'd show adhere whatever dumb principles rather chickenshit second they're called out. can't even right, thankfully so. Car Vehicle Induced Death sense make jealous people hustle. suppose would to. Maybe move Bolivia friend likes talk shit country, hear kind poverty easier someone like bear, know, shit brains. fact great idea. Get american hating ass send Bolivian folks place. Well good thing he’s scientist........oh wait he’s politician. mean, every manager follows governor twitter. listens broadcasts. Giving 48 hours seems reasonable.

That said, really see offices shutting again.  Yikes. Yep, saying. general. can't ways. can't cheap stuff. choose.

Interestingly enough, actually see students network effectively internet, person. Platforms hosted portfolios networks like linked in, addition attending events campus. Things changing. Networking campus productive used be. clue. Maybe. really idea. think it’s probably smarter wait info rather rely anecdotal evidence. Unless get immunity. Fair enough, I'm assuming quarantine procedure new arrivals. never thought would unhappy country. think well kids adapted technology would well online education. online education improved past decade?

In college online courses hit miss, math courses overpriced codes books pretty helpful classes chat rooms forums. Wish people positions power would say that. Cool, ok. antivaxx people? people insurance insured can't afford yearly exam? Now, I'd like see parts nation follow lead! went work today physically work number computers. saw four people today, **four**. building 'closed,' even despite that, took time put signs, tape, arrows designate directions... 

And there's factory even masks. Wha id rather die cold anyway help reading lung damage people sustaining. Seems pretty feasible someone going live 90, die 60-70 got pneumonia would otherwise withstood 100% lungs. people saying wanted basically get would immunity. based false assumption immunity lasts forever. people questioning even lasts months. Brazil, US, Sweden pretty much places said want dance virus. places tried keep control. giant experiment one idea outcome. hope people long term issues, weird lung neurological issues, would assumption wishful thinking? right. take look UK. Brexit Boris didnt care Covid got himself. Soo, goggles gonna next? Lol second wave consist different form virus 2 waves coexist. OMG

Sure might nutjobs western countries even think find diet consists Fox News, Breitbart healthy dose far right Twitter accounts.

The best bit they're yelling trusting government 1) government wanted 2) guys top believe wearing masks anyway. government telling wear masks, American people, common sense science telling wear masks exactly. covid-19 disease *triggers* immune response, meaning it’s literally “ill effect” disease. 

So there’s that. None six things require effort, flights becomes habit.

My argument went something like everyone says Aids killed Freddie Mercury. Sure pneumonia finished off, aids killed him. would count someone stage 4 cancer happens finished COVID death?

Now kid article definitely COVID death. would alive probably time COVID. theory. spread freely hospitals lot already sick people. lot casualties. also spread homes elderly, old people need care, longer healthy enough look themselves.

does anybody info that? I’m inclined agree exact argument, screen book replacement good instructor led course, necessarily spirit argument. University college lot cases best method learn soft skills industries hire for. good professor try teach thinking outside box, flexible confidently mastering new skill complete job quickly, interpersonal skills branching skill sets outside specific stream, experience school, theory grades, knowing “subject”, hard skills. Group projects labs waste time way structured suppose could used soft skills.

And end, 10 years industry - don’t hire theory CS background much. technical interviews don’t require someone writing code down, would tackle problem, think best practice common tasks stack, discussing previous projects worked on. problem solver team player every sense worth much technical ability. Senior engineers obviously matter for, need experience school role anyways, needs years practical experience. pretty basic programming sysadmin knowledge teach someone proficient stack. can’t teach someone interact clients, time management project leadership.

**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed.

ARDS happens within 8-12 days symptoms appear. Hospitalization usually around day 10-12 symptoms appear. Median hospital stay among survivors 10-13 days.

Plenty ""experts"" calling everyone idiots corona affect children. minds, stupid thing **not** go Disney. people huh? best personal interest hope case. pretty much uncharted territory makes worried personal livelihood, can’t even begin imagine others weren’t lucky much already lost. It’s depressing imagine even feeling right now. vaccine trials created prove harmful. exacerbate create issues virus actually accquired. bit ethics issue.

 historic examples: 

Don't know details health scientist. Right know safe creating response want, currently used healthy ideal candidates. Phase 3 starting brings people different ages, demographics underlying conditions. 

Also right know response want could different upon actually exposed.

The techniques vaccines read different much safer before. focused giving people esentially inactive virus, using new advanced techniques specifically get body create antibodies. (Probably lot detail here).

What describe right scares many people people claiming want vaccine without proper approval testing. Vaccines taken years years develop 1 year one. one wants cut corners.

What done similar thought process. phase 3 begins, start manufacturing vaccines ahead time. passes released large quantities. least trying protect citizens. TX AZ looking pretty scary.  dirty dirty You’re achieving though. Good luck /r/MaskSkepticism you’re buried venomous replies get one comment per ten minutes. Reddit really needs change algorithms stop generating echo chambers Indiana schools choice. mandate state 51% days must physically classroom. waivers 180 day requirements. can't wait dumbest people twitter change profile name ""selfish bastad"" actually makes sense.

We'll getting initial waves phase 3 data phase 2 processed. We'll know we're looking potentially viable vaccine, start producing phase 3 happens. I'm going get hidden Mickey covid. /me social distancing non-hug

Twas comparative take biggest outbreak per capita state area Texas A&amp;M recall correctly. may changed makes horrifying want students return high risk area. Yeah think slowly easing reservations peak times might best bet. I'm extra wary amount people tried come dine moment patios allowed open. patio. can't graduate unpaid fees. schools can't even start next academic year. 

Sure, hopefully schools work students. someone worked academia, know will. going fuck lot people long time. TLDR: Politician trying understand statistical data. failed. Americans afford vacations? can't even afford week work. Thank you. per suggestions, one delivered house morning That’s low number Louisiana weekend. cracked 2,000 per day late last week averaging around 1,750 per day.

Deaths climbing. gotten deaths Covid single digits daily high 146 it’s going back up. We’ve 20s today reported 43 Covid deaths. leadership complete failed politics eclipsed public health. Yay! Authoritarianism! could everyone else!!! Yes!! pawning ability ""do good"" local officials ignores fact *Gavin Newsome* given direct power handle pandemic Trump's ""philosophy"" pandemic give power *governors*. Gavin Newsom threw power away like Trump. *can* save people afraid enough make angry, inevitably will. 

I always go back quote beginning this: never know overreacted pandemic, see devastating losses life underreact. are, underreacted, watching people die. grateful he's Gov. Sadly, probably greater 1%. That's confirmed case count, many asymptomatic people tested. thing happening Arizona. beyond disgusted people. cold eaten get weird feeling throat, like closing up, start dry heave. weird annoying, live AZ happen often. 

Anyway, first put mask sometimes get throat feeling. relax face, breathe slowly nose, mouth couple minutes, everything fine. would never use excuse wear mask. really bad, I'd order groceries. 

 one likes wear mask, everyone we'd get faster wear mask one day!! People damn selfish, driving crazy!  get away life bit, y'know $120k every paramedic, firefighter, law enforcement professional? number insulting anyone. EMS personnel: Currently state-certified Basic EMTs, 11,094; currently state-certified Intermediate EMTs, 43; currently state-certified paramedics, 5,167. can't deal fucking morons, US real nightmare. need enact federal guidelines strict seriously enforced significant fines jail time. also start media campaign leads people seeing footage ER / ICU commercial breaks. needs get real fucking hicks millions people die. obviously thar's going happen. We're going keep going New England California taking seriously basically entire south mid-west infect everyone else. America needs universal healthcare think that's realistically accurate. needs 130° F much. pretzel eating skills subpar though That’s I’m saying - pay children, experience horrors virus personally way family members, forever connect Disney memory taint Disney reputation long run. 

It’s definite it’s huge gamble Cool story bro filed end may payments backdated april 11th, got approved still gotten shit. filed 11 weeks far say pending/monetary ineligible. Can't get anyone phone email Trump quotes demonstrating similar leadership tactics:

Else die.

Kentucky pastor Dana Coverstone strange prophetic dreams emphasizing 2020 months March (COVID-19 hits USA) June (racial unrest) , September (???), November (gun violence involving Russian troops Chinese troops USA soil presidential election). dreams started late 2019, hope dreams BS. Except thstd meant since 90s agree, especially goal enlightened population. Much better everyone remain place forever rather go see cultures learn new things! slope stabilized turn head! missed point. smart move let 100 years grandmother go there. wife lost grandmother 2 months ago covid. 103 years old well people stay indoors summer due heat, vice versa winter due cold. 

spring lockdown guess didnt get enough trial see....maybe fall? doubt flu show well..... big balls close state idiot tourists. He'd make local municipality enforce masks. vouch western slope wearing god damn mask. Ah yes. local famous customers maintaining social distancing whilst chatting bollox. deaths per day? selective pressure 

Well kinda now... throws shoe? Honestly, fight like woman! wrong about? Aside mask snafu early on. explained reasoning plenty times now. They’ve gone saying “it’s like flu killed less” “it’s death rate flu” argument fell apart surpassed 70-80k deaths. Doesn’t matter evidence is, they’ll justify somehow fit feelings. man deserves monument.  agree things change, one person either side bring say ""I wrong""... thats problem situation, everyone always right. fact people think Fauci God. One links actually date link. 06/03/2020 BLM protests taking place places. Question: theory anything ""wrong"" idea eugenics?

I feel like similar issue communism theory wonderful corruption inherent people would fuck up. idea breeding smarter future generation take long racists grab hold use stats context claim need sterilise black people something like that.

In perfect world it'd nice smarter, stronger, empathetic compassionate society currently perfect world matter anyway blue wave coming real time... trumpets election Well, based pretty scary speculation, second wave could worse people may get severely ill second time get covid-19 due [antibody depedent I'm close Asheville mostly bad tourists. Boils blood ride see scads people town - shopping, eating tramping parks uncovered faces children tow. 

The locals good fairly liberal. still pretty ""I ain't scared Rona, government make wear mask, Trump 2020"" get publicly scolded lot.

Hell. weeks ago grown white woman Asheville sexually harassed teenage daughter mother people color wearing head coverings. grabbed little girl told going r-worded get *her* (the old woman's) country. 

If people like survive *here*, can't imagine vermin thrives less progressive cities. Polis man  don’t know red tape would speed trials absolutely would. Unfortunately guess primary volunteers would people like me...young, healthy, super risk is. Noooooooo worst place take mask surrrounded maskless strangers. think going change idea American exceptionalism idea untouchable nation eternally dominate. Yeah, we’re exceptional nation handling pandemic worse country world Sweden generally strikes high risk environment tbh. Agree. spike call today (government. health, still) verge “hot spot.”

Hoping wishing everyone right thing. People town behaving now.

Edit: gotten two shit. could still go everything sun except dine restaurant get hair cut.  

Target open, check. Walmart, check. Auto parts stores, check. hardware store ala Home Depot, check. Gas stations, check. Banks, check. more. 

Could still go TV shopping, phone shopping, clothes shopping, take food, etc. 

Life really didn’t change much. I'm SE Florida influx New Yorkers came straight hotspot refused observe social distancing, wear masks, etc. 

Thats why....lol see someone else playing Dawn Man quarantine. mean, he’s wrong. small bump up, tho, gotta keep eye that. private ones.

I'd say lot private primary secondary schools going hard time it, well. Let's face it, kids ages, essentially paid babysitters, there's slightest possibility another school shutdown, parents going shell five figure sums annual tuition. many cases, little help get prestigious university.  idiots also Finland, rarely weird Murican conspiracy theorists, also fewer (I guess). Currently policy masks here, hand, current covid situation Finland good (7 day average currently five new confirmed infection per day, would comparable 300 cases USA per day). real question? Gotta love downvotes people clueless issue. Come live NYC lakewood see feel groups. 

They people brooklyn coming lakewood height pandemic weddings funerals, ignored social distancing mask orders. 

They huge contributor mass deaths occurred here. Jesus lord...I really hate him.  Literally everyone wears masks boston. still see people saying wear masks Fauci told us months ago. people realize said made mistake corrected it? 

"" Fauci asked guidance early pandemic people need wear masks unless sick health care workers. Along surgeon general, Dr. Jerome Adams, Fauci admitted mistake "" That's deaths everywhere come Naa, conservatives always double down. 

Democrats always stay home. Rubio hides tweets bible verses considering Scott led company largest Medicare fraud settlement time, he’s probably figuring scam tax money this. Breaking lease costs lot money. Despite seeing mirror, I'm starting look hot af can't totally blame Governor, people wearing masks distancing also blame. Ultimately responsible safety not? government pass laws make seatbelts mandatory one actually buckle work.

I get it, blame can't powers idiots wear ones still keeping virus going. 
I'm American I'm observer, mask orders Vancouver people wearing protect others. right thing do. I've worked restaurants good chunk working life always tried switch kitchens metric. Wtf measuring ounces grams literally easiest thing divide? sounds great, activities? Haha episodes saw, never fired person, always shitty edit. Wow! r/TIL Campus fees make 2% tuition lot schools, many services covered still use pandemic. real crime much overcharging product becoming objectively inferior price remains same. like ENJOY wrong, something They're allergic truth. state country gloom doom. Ignoring attacking Fauci make different. Nau also death march person classes. guess would ameliorating effect AZ 

TX 

CA 

probably someone coming join soon even needs written national disgrace. Thank decades continued invaluable service, Dr. Fauci.  fucking shame florida resident rn!! Fuck FDA still approve it. Enjoy high, friend. want reiterate I've said posts regarding this:

It's fall, here. Action happen NOW. even hear news shows political podcasts ""the fall"" ""in two months school starts"". report back TWO WEEKS. district still today still forcing us back classroom person classes students first week August. That's three weeks.

This issue need start talking come solution August, need start implementing better long term home based form schooling spring becuase time already upon us. Good 'ol Jim Justice ... """"We want everyone know playtime stuff."" gotta talk people like they're preschoolers sad place be. though he's done pretty decent job. Getting people listen another matter. Man, gvt needs talk teachers change fact 4 weeks one us either needs quit job send kids daycare. mean honestly, tell point allowing daycare remain open school? feels like political move example elect average man President. Presidents extraordinary top 0.001% humans. mean, haven’t restaurant while, cousin graduated high school hostess years. Yeah golf shit. China lie closed whole country immediately January, one province, whole world could avoided it. even tell others close borders chinese citizens, course cared reputation (which shit already) people's lives. people China flew abroad even they've declared lockdown Wuhan, total madness criminal neglect. Elected officials busy downplaying denying severity virus instead looking reality planning memes happening. Interesting. sub loves ban things “uncivil” yet comment remains. Yes. season kinda sorta starts around Thanksgiving really kick till Christmas goes till around Easter. That's say tourist times year, yea, summer fuckin dead time, especially restaurants. share sentiments, I've also seen Idiocracy apologize advance get hopes up... Lmfao bet youd love came take land away you. no. dont anything say rest. look sides coin man. deaths......most succumb this. 

You really need focus negative aspects much. yes hard keep youre going break mind ptsd, man.....

we swimming shark infested waters here, although right kinda seems way bad news flying around legitimately terrifying... even possible. woman business near job title, must way fire her. needs happen immediately. ""I'm sure country went wrong...""

Really? gonna happen. FREEDUMB states dollar sign majority them. absolutely must buckle wear fucking masks. STAY AWAY BARS, SHOWS, PARTIES, MORONS.

But people pretending like protests enormous part surge intellectually dishonest. There's ideal time massive civil unrest, obviously worst possible time middle pandemic. mad moron running country rallies, think hypocrite recently part larger crowD. Lina thing preventing Houston Miami. Thank you!  positive rate mostly irrevant..

better look total number new hospitalizations number new deaths... steadily increasing Yeah sure always tend always price check peak days never remember price changes throughout year. understanding know friends work Main entrance Disney really make money ticket sales. real cash cow hotels sure merch. Really evil. That’s capitalism you. Well terrifying. idea strep could that. I’ve staring post 15 minutes still idea could possibly mean Huh, would depend widely available testing many non-sick people getting tested peace mind rather real suspicion exposure/illness. NYC get surge, tons BLM protests (shrug) fuck church service 30 hours?? 

#unsubscribe Realistically, probably minimum one year. Hopefully, three maybe. I'm little high bear me. Russia says works sells America... Yes. enough doomers own. oppose it, care Palestine, oppose believe wait messiah take land return Jews. 3 months home kids, I've got sympathy world. learn scientific method school? needs happen nationwide. way kids going manage keep masks on, sanitize, social distance 4 7 hours isolated class room ONE 2 teachers control them. gong chaos parent supports opening classrooms year, garbage human feel bad child. Opening schools make spread astronomical. Listen science, keep schools closed.  good training future remote job, too. Might well go Community College first 2 years transfer 4 year. Hopefully 2 years corona virus behind us. think we'd bit outnumbered... Sorry! Can't wait Trump's rally come Jacksonville.. Governer rolled red carpet. Dumb.  So, chosen... death! Got one alerts Harvey years ago. kinda unsettling see tbh. say “the BLM protests seem contributed minimally current surge cases”? Thx. tough worth it. big firm used work went huge layoff years back, cutting mostly older folks decades many cases. asked reapply jobs, offered another role steep pay cut. Don’t ever feel like past loyalty hard work insulate lay-off. it’s open season, it’s open fucking season. Also forgot BLM protests absolutely contributing factor whatsoever spread virus. ""I wish mf'er would"" think he’s gargling mouses balls. hail mighty dollar Virginia, DC, Maryland likely close schools

why can't west Virginia dumbfucks could listen follow DMV Testing ramp ups U.S. least complete shit. There's way vaccine worth anything coming next year later year narrative goes. Production, producing vials put vaccine in, shipping, logistics, company awarded contract administration mass produce, politics behind that, etc. Yep, they're selfish bastards care anybody themselves. care less killed paralyzed woman wheelchair got covid-19, **THEY** get sick, immediately expect drop everything help them. essentially, they're Karens. illusion choice things matter achieved illusion. Special Interests massive money withholding healthcare reforms Biden Trump pockets PACs. protests lol He's actually saying despite errm, situation US China still learn them, matter badly think always things right that's worth learning from. fact decide take politician's words leading infectious disease expert I'm ashamed American. God we're fucking stupid. Hasnt Astra Zenica exactly since May Oxford vaccine? British American governments placing orders hundreds millions doses January? like Sweden outbreak areas eventually sort herd immunity couple months. Sweden numbers going across board wit lockdown. This. Study online free instead paying it. got it, would absolutely zero sympathy. people bringing helping cause entire problem first place. hell them. Oof    Exactly. Leaving bad yelp review would anything BBB. Human beings stupid fucking animals. Yeah look back examine pandemic bet estimates easily we’ve already seen million deaths goes ways, Democrats Republicans like that, care things give votes. He’s right preparations governors states?

All states public health agencies. busgets have? budget cuts done past 10 years? Everyone wants feds bail out. neglect preparations years? Even get programs place, going mean much employers going can't bothered hire; even meet requirements. mindset employers change, re-training going help many. Given US even 500 deaths yesterday, think surge past 1000 tomorrow? he'd drop landleech tendencies start empathizing droves people across state staring barrel losing homes, already. judging Park Ave packed extended stay hotels, have.

He needs help people, needs something this. Ultra Orthodox Jews best reputation Israel. Yeah, agree that. still know IFR think likely lower march. elected lead....not read. Florida swing state, right? vote last time. Maybe time possibly voted contracted COVID may change minds already dead? \*hope springs eternal\* That's way WW2-Propaganda-style. anything absolutely convince anti-maskers government control illuminati whatever fuck believe. Making BBQ Great Again...one bullet time son works hospital says wearing regular surgical masks N95's wear longer. He's one politicized masks man. I'm genuinely starting become scared people safety essential workers. people money, food, shelter, start raiding supermarkets.  tried nursing homes work well. Still got mass transit essentials NYC. like 40oz  world view, logic common sense.

Virus infections likely closed setting, i.e., restaurants bars opposed outside. So, although certainly infections protests (especially one violently broken police), sure infections people partying. safer

If spread country odds getting equivalent odds area live in. odds increase total exposure have, i.e. many people live social are.

When entire league ""bubble"" together, highlight, safer. issue, bubble area that's epicenter spread. someone breaks bubble likely get virus. Combined fact testing backogged one day someone broke quarantine becomes likely someone catch covid19 bubble test it.

So typically one player got big deal isolated other. odds everyone team gets players long term issues rare. worst case scenario stars getting low separate. However, bubble together non insignificant chance whole NBA catches covid19 increasing chances number big stars long term complications.

So sum separate better chance one player getting it. However, together much higher chance entire team gets aggregate would make likely player complications ends career. early data even suggested smokers less mortality virus ex-smokers higher mortality virus. recall reading back April fairly small size (iirc 100 people data adjusted age differences) still interesting usual assumptions reliable virus. Either way, better careful risky media calling out? missed give week! Go immigrant neighborhood united states, see people working, see people obviously option leave - they'd rather stay work. need word it, use dumb ass eyes. Anyone notice all.... hunch backed... kinda weird Anything DeVos' mouth scares ne **isn't much dangerous flu!**

If anything, considering estimates flu deaths misreported year 'natural causes' coronavirus **about lethality flu!**

The issue coronavirus lethality it. makes put ventilator lot cases chance survival. available right even places seeing exploding coronavirus numbers.

Yes, people wear masks. Yes, many possible stay home would easier feds gave citizen permanent resident 1500 dollar per month pay basic bills.

However making virus like modern Black Plague various groups pushing back, read damned numbers realize ""No, ain't modern Black Plague!"" wish I’m half way thru junior year classes need graduate can’t take local community colleges. Taking gap year won’t help I’m unemployment I’m using pay apartment. I’m gunna tough apartment year since 4 5 classes already scheduled remote learning. they? Yes. they? President It’s cool quit job &amp; keep eating, everyone option.

*edit - word  city would shutdown again. I'd feel lot safer then. live Charlotte, NC little testing many infected COVID even realize. one wearing masks, everyone past weekend popular areas town mingling, groups, social distancing, seems dumb city forgot COVID even exists.

It legit scary here. wish lived somewhere safe(r). I've never someone say want live another country political/social/economic thing occurs...until now. want here.

But, still thankful American. life good easy successful compared many others worldwide, I'm complaining. wish neighbors fellow citizens wore masks, washed hands, social distances, didnt forget we've going thru world going thru since began last year. That’s exactly problem. read ‘contact tracing’ ‘the US’ mind went separate ways: ‘they really that’ (though would risk cases going reported 50,000 daily somewhere close 70,000 daily) ‘this going get much pushback’. I’m entirely sure sort mechanism would constitutional one even was, I’m sure wouldn’t something majority people would comply (as said, ‘freedumb rights’ basically catch mild inconvenience). aren’t complacent probably need traced most. Governor Ron Palpatine  Masks look stupid uncomfortable. also involves wearer assume he/she carrier, lot people think insult.

That said, worth inconvenience regret sincerely apologize telling people thread paranoid back January. saw many posts stocking supplies stuff need. thought joke. I’m sorry. moment, potentially, I’d like know studies you’re referring to. 

But, assuming make far species, assuming trend towards urbanisation continues saaaaaay, million years?

You would see evolutionary adaption relating urban environment- although ‘see’ maybe wrong way define it, could something like enzyme production neurological adaption Right? police gonna do? Knock doors private residences hunch? Explain math $600 benefit running suddenly difference survival. “Science” says reduce risk transmission wearer. Please refer worlds respected medical journal, [The think you’ll find people don’t wear masks “science deniers”. going backwards: 7,000, 8000, 5000, 3700 dad feel like invincible too. French really ""MEH FREEDUMB"" problem. think virus big deal, matter say, matter show him, he's full denial mode.

I see months. Like rest family give fuck. (Actually, mother one taking extra precaution know virus serious buiseness.)

I weak immune system cirrhosis liver, clearly said majority family GTFO. problem. 
But FUCKING PROBLEM kind person dangerous ME. (Even if, one way another I'm actually dead man cirrhosis.)

So...yeah. Feel you. Family really toxic, -no offense- dad dick.
Common sense : ""I need protect childrens !"" ""You need mask, NEED FREEDUM""

In sense, 2020 scared HELL, thinking 2 years best. Now...when see humanity is, situation, drama, gouvernement like ""money first"", I'm tired shit point, wait liver strike saying ""WELL GOOD LUCK SHIT ! I'm done !""

Take care sister. mind toxic peoples. Let try survive, acting like assholes. Oh next time father tell sister drop mask, slap good. 

Ps: Sorry babbling bad English... yeah board meetings slow time changing situation.
Looks like school district called emergency meeting tomorrow distant learning, even though county green weeks. cases determined individual people test count? told someone working hospital time test positive, counts case. test people multiple times though. serious question- I'm trying argue cases, etc. DeSensitized

It's like empathy people's suffering around don’t know sick interested learning guy apparently hasn’t sick enough know either absolutely devastating  Wow.. don’t even know begin addressing stupidity.

Being forced wear mask government charge body health. forced, it’s choice. really difficult understand?

Most people thinking themselves.. government media tell do, without question... 3 months pandemic lived city hit hard virus symptoms resemble common flu cold symptoms, want find actually earlier one mild/asymptomatic cases told wide spread? Good you. 10k per counselng session Ah yes, 2 pictures (1 doesn’t even working link) = entirety BLM protests Yup, [has known AC play part causing coronavirus infections. case February China, people seated path air stream AC unit restaurant got infected. referring something specific? Oh no, politician thinks choosing wear mask due mental health reasons makes selfish bastard. Guess better go cry change mind. really presented good argument.

/S $120k go far lol sure serious, partner tested far majority STDs could get without fucking third person nothing worry about. really \_can be\_ non issue talking about. Try get pulse oximeter can. could catch low oxygen people don’t always notice. Also many n95 masks vent unfiltered air directly valve flap. made mistake going Hospital corrected right quick.  Politicians generally professional politicians little skill experience anywhere else. really matter elect influenced fund elections. Trump guy even politician, guy living inheritance put position political power likely he's easily controlled idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

So anyway, good luck that. first get cases level contact tracing even possible. states getting hammered right now, literally impossible. would need hundreds thousands contact tracers state. states, contact tracing shit this, number new cases drastic. gonna get every first responder margarita? \*makes notepad adventure idea\* Lip service. way really enforce rule. get wrong, people absolutely wear masks can't maintain distance, simply see local law enforcement actually enforce anything. Portland Police can't even bothered solve rampant car, bike, general theft problems plague city. Increased sales child-sized coffins seems bad first realize stock company makes child-sized coffins went up. Big picture, it’s what’s best economy.

/s   Seeing comments going Instagram disheartening. fucked. literally not, though. advantage kid that's potty trained, suppose? get it....you great healthcare...but machine guns freedom!?

/s Seriously FUCK consistently okay? cases deaths happened Trump administration ignoring Fauci want try blame right thing telling truth?

Where public outrage?? insane. do! want aha moment see credible source legitimate data. much protestor right.  DeSantis done nothing, all. flatly refused issue stay-home lock-down. flatly refused issue mask order. ordered counties open businesses, blamed local politicians things went badly.  over, expect DeSantis jail hundred thousand counts manslaughter. don’t disagree, point different President would authority make states what’s really needed.

There’s nothing Constitution asshole calling people liars. things Constitution prevent President taking actions requiring masks worn everywhere. That's horrible good read. 

Having degree means nothing now. need tech skills. I'm going back school tech. Combined skills ones plan get set.

Tech. degree tech, learn tech combine degree. Heck , we’ll l even share avocado toast [BREAKING NEWS: Trump orders US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort Arizona help overwhelmed [""One churro, please."" / ""That'll 14 wear mask work I'm already 40+ hours week, free time whether I'm running errands something never wear mask. private businesses require it, go somewhere else. mask uncomfortable I'm going wear one outside work. telling protests cause makes lot real government uses emergency alert phone. loads people straight listen believe ""the media"". still might give shit actual alert used, would less likely people ignore it. what’s difference Trump administration CCP? CCP least cares citizens! Looks death toll. understand. Someone flies one states, says quarantining 2 weeks, gives contact info? want give contact info get fine (and understand that)...so what's point this? guess people wall heater something. dunno. fucked. anytime someone tries group US countries long maternity leave, paid sick leave, universal healthcare.......i gotta laugh.

we're shithole. cause iPhones top pile shit make us great. patent holder stopped making anymore ventilators cheap requires certain amount intellect acceptance change, many inhabitants United States lack. look landed us. 

To many, quicker get back normal, better. don’t doubt countries rise ashes bring change. I’m bit pessimistic regards good ole US A. 

I hope god I’m proven wrong. possible scenario, expecting virus become extremely mild time mostly wishful thinking. Small pox actually successful virus spreading despite 30% IFR indeed endemic without evolving milder form millennia. thing changed development vaccine.

We yet identify viral sequences produce milder version illness. Plus killing fewer people actually wouldn’t even advantageous case. IFR around 0.5-0.8% deaths occurring weeks illness course many people milder infections would recovered isn’t much selective pressure covid need kill fewer people order keep spreading. Measles endemic much world IFR isn’t much better 0.2%. also millennia reduce hasn’t. point it’s guaranteed virus evolve become less deadly deadlier covid 1918 flu did. worry space force build wall around earth asteroid belt pay denialists brainwashed Swedes realizing government authorities could actually lying them. Store owner live report people wear masks let stores cashier. take maska walking around.

What world wrong Abbott? Texans allow lead leadership? even popular anymore?

I'm CA people saying NEWSOM enough protect us, shutting things back down. cannot see right call Abbott, even assume care anyone wants keep power. abandoning residents get fired? got lucky looking first house 2008.

Thanks luck! seeing judges issuing order left right. nothing pipe dream Easy choices point. Close down. Move Canada help build stronger economy country gives shit population. Covid cases there, correct? cares? Texans themselves. average person there, nutjob like Abbott isn‘t conservative enough. Earlier studies showed smokers less likely get sick, likely severe symptoms if/when do. 3rd spoiler: continue skyrocket people still crowding resturants... place go without mask lots states. feel like it’s two generations.

Republican president's response national lockdown ban interstate travel. think needs try protect many people possible, higher risk populations. bc considered low risk spread ones higher risk. 

In eyes governor decides keep state open they’re reaching record breaking numbers daily irresponsible Everyone needs engineers.  welcome back. quarantine 14 days get here! :) governors absolutely adamant controlled restrictions states, period, end discussion. Revisionist history happening. Didn’t say agreed, stating facts. Asking officials mandate masks many said won't? Simply laughable. Magical?? LMAO! What's major? Cuz country shit show. Doubt people Orange County dumb Karens Darylls Douglas County shaking rage. threat politics humans. guess understand double meaning.

Have noticed past month two Trump administration took masks? made smirking comments wearing them? found lied let play game little longer. Yes, even deceived highest levels. Fauci, Gates, cronies running show administration said ""no f*ck WHO, we're done games""

Ultimately, power move. administration let show cards, ""hey, want vaccine, microchip, contact tracing, house arrest, freedom travel scared rest life""

And enough SMART people saw game, 1/3 country said ""no, f*ck no, never ever vaccine idiots"" fauci said ""shoot, guess one going take vaccine :/"" people put power back administration's hands.

The went back forth 4 times whether mask would work? CDC published definitive article said mask would ever protect particle .12 microns size? THEY'RE EVEN GOOD GAME. SAD PEOPLE FELL THIS.

The reason come tell us ""hey hoax, fooled"" would look TERRIBLE would almost nip reelection. president cabinet lied mess happened, one would trust again. Especially understand narrative behind it. understandably so.

This virus, Frankenstein multiple viruses put together, lethal. affect systems body, like calcium channels, could lead higher susceptibility inflammation. like 1-2 scale 10 terms lethality lasting issues.

But distributed passed along like deep-state owned media (think soros, gates..hello? want take mandatory vaccine, 60 Billion dollar money scheme!) claimed.

The coronavirus never ever isolated human, antibodies ever found. read comments, go back read listen every single link posted. many hours research know people dont give enough crap read listen, smart spend hundreds hours uncover actually going here.

Bottom line: deep-state fraud attack end-to-end designed FORCE country breakdown, force martial law, social credit scores, AI technology implemented factories (because unsafe due ""virus"") break food supply ruin education systems.

if see this, cannot help you. brain owned system many years. really wish could wipe soil eyes. sad. think gap year, think kids traveling world parents money. 

Also, many us go straight college due scholarship requirements. guess depends one's academic situation. even include non-existent unemployment aide since system designed fuck people over. I’d guess TCU Found one selfish bastards.  absolutely miserable winter.  Smart school system capability. we’re GA, want open. keeps saying it. it. You’re good person, please stay safe healthy anyone tried explaining military 99% people survive, it’s basically thing flu? Looks like military spent much time watching CNN. /s Exponential growth, seems like everything fine, isn't. LA county 3 million residents entire state Arizona. Well, guess get reply, perhaps something consider decide attempt shame another person comment like dare suggest otherwise.  Well, shit. Youre right. lazy took 50/50 shot ended wrong.

Somehow ended different sides debate. forced onto side. I’ll take headlines I’m surprised slightest 800 Alex OHHHHH YOUUUTTTTHHHHHHSSS  district refuses require masks. adults schools? children come home adults grandparents well? kids summer break Florida right now. want kids next class? Please bring universal health care too! Got try one drinks now, sounds like would go well poutine. Well that's industry would expected well. What's explanation I'm missing? People stuck home schmellies? seriously talking dropping $200 extra. completely destroy people living high cost living areas. stop testing we’d literally 0 cases. Cmon people let’s get economy going again! Never get involved land war Asia.

Never go Sicilian DEATH line wearing balaclava mask

I personally use baclava. like honey nut smell. Lol. reminds early days NYC. “Why minorities impacted, don’t go place hamptons.” Yep. There'll definitely coming. could care less man killed 77 year old man confronted wearing face mask. Fuck guy, shoot times. I’m curious CA got hit particularly hard? Didn’t pretty big shutdown early on?  less derision states hit early important lessons learned. NYC borderline early.

Excess deaths counter goes brrrrrrr  running 700k tests day number hasn’t stopped increasing, don’t think Trump’s irresponsible comments caused us start running fewer tests. demand tests clearly increased faster supply US think sending fewer tests overwhelmed labs clear backlog isn’t present countries best option much sucks. i'm still alive. orgies.

That's effectively CA despite locking first heavy population tied Asia generally mask friendly approach pandemics, even seeing high % mask wearing seem enough.

The problem never truly locked down. Per Apple's COVID-19 mobility index, travel dropped around 60% region, Italy/Spain, mobility dropped close 90%. problem people love mobility US California people love outdoors. supposed go unless absolutely to, people would make excuses go crowded parks, beaches, hiking trails, etc. familiar Bay Area already know places crowded begin pre-COVID, locations flock lockdown, kept people contact others. tons tons people get respiratory symptoms. people get headache day people zero symptoms people hospital double pneumonia every spectrum between. right thing getting test. hope feel better soon. thanks kind words good sir! caused spikes. I'm sick tired people trying downplay everything. 

Just like told months ago beginning lockdown masks help prevent virus. Lol well see went over. 

Everyone lying us people accept it. I'm wondering someone would willing make case China lying case numbers. I've heard claim many times seen evidence credible organizations making claim. 



China responded virus pretty dang fast, like 2 weeks locking hundreds millions inside 3 months. US took month shut lasted couple weeks.



The current daily case numbers China comparable neighbors less draconian. also responded forcefully small outbreaks Wuhan Beijing shows actually using numbers release extra medical resources move around freely. inundated like US south.



I distrust China generally people charge shown actually want limit spread even cost political support. would seem accurate case numbers would interest government, given expressed intent.



So evidence contrary? Something like international health organization spy agency making claims? government seeming react nonexistent outbreaks? fact know capable fudging numbers lead us believe actually are?



Also I'm interested much think change records, whether factor 10 100 whatever. precise, first sigfig.



(I'm expert genuine question) word warning plate shaming growing issue Canada. Lots reports ppl American plates sworn told go home. ppl cars damaged. sure plan going Canada. Would love know precautions put place, namely mask wearing number droplets produced outdoors immediately disperse breeze?

Which means get less number breaths indoors. Less mean none. 

it's cumulative still add theory. stumbled gate bit.

It's system we've created perpetuated. yes, uninsured absence preventative medicine two major issues. Calling way suggests meds expensive.

Half people actually vote wont. blame democrats shutdown. Guarenteed.  No, absolutely random sample participants decided accept decline testing.

You assume refused afraid testing positive. may feared positive test symptoms disclose contact tracer.

Given weaknesses US contact tracing, really little way deal lie fail disclose information tracer. tracked otherwise. one monitoring spending, phone records anything else.

That’s point. Yes down, yes increase. Lol American Back fake news, got sources back up? husband visited friend (another couple’s) house day. 4 people all.

We sat outside backyard two different tables ~10 12 feet apart, one table per household; wore masks weren’t eating drinking; duplicate snack bowls table small ice bucket beer wine foot table households didn’t share. also tower fan blowing perpendicularly two us droplets would blown away.

The cases Canada (even resulting US bedshit pandemic response), better look leaders squatting beds Americans.  Winnipeg NHL hub city?  allllllllll gna die Fantasy US, yes.

The rest world things, things, greater lesser extent.

Unfortunately mean US likely fall fourth point, borders closed (this exactly happening - Canada, Mexico EU shut US borders). I'm convinced coming schools daycare issue, pediatricians fed every parent spending 24/7 children. really feel governors actually something met vitriol. governor's shutting stuff protect idiots adamantly them. fun, health safety everyone. They're literally trying impeach governor wolf restrictions issued. makes sense. Similar Maryland.

Strict policies put place pretty early everyone kind adapted well. 
Very people I’m seeing causing much fuss.

Smart politicians make huge fucking difference Hmm yes, floor made floor extend current form I'd bet 400$ too.

States could barely get PUA payments right, way capabilities calculate every one's pay even upload tax returns. could barely get extra $600 right. Yeah guess think wearing mask means worn anywhere neck, arms, foot. Assuming guy legally carrying, anyone supporter guns/gun rights denouncing kinds people. irresponsible bullshit ruins everyone else. fuck Trump removed earlier year? fuck fuck bad vs guy clearly evil?  Yes fool proof, access soap water, second best option there. found [PDF says, eating food sanitiser use, consider safe. dirt, hospital used, soap must used. bitterness sanitisers confuses consumer like me, products genuine not, cause bitter.

We actually seem fairly well. really go much, yesterday saw someone wearing mask around neck... Instead covering y'know mouth. Im much concerned. trolling Try like 10 - *excluding weekends* Danish pastry Gammeldansk! Orange County - County without college degree 😂 every Trump related shitshow, rest GOP owns it. late complain, Lady G. top head, Finland, Canada, Norway also lower mask usage.

Here chart  That’s parade don’t want relive!  knew theyd roll back fact even needed ridiculous That's hilarious... live apartment moment. wouldnt going store safer cheaper fine fuck test everyone town covid would try send back. choose ""leave"" knows they'll stop along way they'll actually try leave all. leave willingly we'd need go deportation process would expose far people people option.

I hope anyone come contact get sick bill American rates.  ""He vaccine immunology experts also said necessarily follow waning immunity natural cases COVID-19 infection would vaccine-induced immune response:

I'm pretty sure leave ground. No, parent home actively supervise young children day biggest hurdle. special swedish strategy apart little beginning, getting massive death count, hardly testing contact tracing stricter stricter measures start testing way countries time passes by?

We Canada! hEaLthY, need mask. Always article fuels people believe virus dangerous. punished how? call unstable genius. -It also directly responded President Trump’s threat withholding funding schools reopen, calling move “misguided approach.”-

They misspelled ""criminally negligent decision"" article said walking around factory without mask ongoing pandemic maybe good reason get plane fly somewhere show could video call into. won't. Correct. made school teachers. Oh. Wait mean yourself? Fuck you. cant force everyone wear one? work. part dress code now. people cant wear face mask medical reasons must wear face shield instead. rules ASK put eating/drinking. need wear 1st snack... I'm curious effects it'll inequality. There's already concern problematic say means ability homeschool permitted access education, two months end year requirements log complete assignments (or, early arguments, instruction provided everybody equal access - Going forward, I'm seeing enough ads seeking private instructors Texas Florida pages many teachers quit work may able find job teaching one student wealthy family schools stay online-only, students check spring reasons lack school-provided device likely hindrances removed next month.

If we'd made different decisions along way, could like countries opening schools strong modifications negligible community spread. Instead we're blazing full steam ahead fronts (including viral spread) deciding restrictions modifications difficult expensive. Here, everybody loses. dont ask DOESNT FIT NARRATIVE RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE Understood, thank sharing. 

Borrowing ""frolick maskless"" use : ) I’m Fullerton, 100% agree you. think see we’re differing. clear, mask wearing beneficial, wearing one isn’t sufficient bridge gap. 

In places like Singapore Seoul, may able live life normally, long you’re wearing mask + avoiding high risk activities. representative controlled spread. 

But given current situation face southern US, (as populace) need behave differently. uncontrolled spread, you’re fighting get people wear masks, you’re far behind. can’t think anywhere else able transition uncontrolled controlled spread without widespread lockdowns. 

Also, reply specifically “technically” correct remark. virus dangerous flu. also gets exactly bad media said can. Hopefully don’t see Miami Houston, fear might. current environment, appears cities continuing current activities adding masks still unsustainable. spam thread nonsense? Heard that.

I know lawyers, really trust experts. let's fair... majority trained US MD's morons except upper middle top tier schools.... there's many medical schools across US real enforcement medical education quality

there's reason Canadian students joke can't get medical school Canada go apply lower tier school US take anyone cheque pulse  Best Buy Durham started curbside pickup right away. met family NJ visiting parents South Carolina stated circumstances going quarantine. really way prove anyone visits without considerable effort. agree, anything, need give government police power laws enforce. enough punitive laws. need surveillance too, spying doctors patients make sure bring religion. need adjust society allow unhealthy people freedom roam around without fear catching cold virus. really monitor control healthy people since greatest threat. related teachers all, regards German thing, check book Thought Free. interested history mass psychology, one best books I've read topic. written 60's 70's American Jewish professor moved Germany number years understand Germans allowed National Socialists gain power Holocaust happen.

I'm American currently living Germany I'd also argue really understand book need spent time living Germany get feel different culture here. very, collectivist compared individualistic American culture is, see first hand makes lot sense atrocities like could happened. like said, people say average citizens aimlessly revolted stop occurring understanding reality complexity situation. see whole situation Americanized lens. people fight back, chose way actually made difference rather aimlessly martyring make point, changed anything. insane amount death going time, throwing onto pile changed anything. wanted make difference would needed find different strategy.

I'm saying allowed sue them, fucking long list. Michigan sheriff’s deputy Tuesday fatally shot man suspected stabbing another man challenged wearing mask convenience store, police said.

When cops caught suspect, suspect pulled knife cops.

Video shooting: mandatory mask rule went effect yesterday. Everybody wear masks inside public places, like supermarkets. love downvotes. one answering valid question. German think VW evil shit years one went prison besides one guy went miami. Court Germany let walk cash paid accused company.

 still find particular huge dick move musk. compared happens meat industry example even bad. alternative sight compete Tesla gonna buy petrol car again. also option good hear. fly next week, we're happy we're Delta. seems like they're taking things seriously. even contacted us couple weeks verify still traveling could move people around plane keep us distanced. level operational foresight comforting. long keep shore reasonable capacity... Saw article morning Long Branch close bc many people there. think pass system hard limit number people beach... *Eye roll* Blame parents also self-indulgent trash. Tents coats get fall regards weather Past time part America kicks ass show up. We’ve seen lot shitty part now. Unfortunately NFL, sucked taxpayer tit stadiums came clause allows city bar fans public safety reasons. think spelled ""ie-store-eeeck"" pay raises travel restrictions?

It stricter stricter time, regardless swedes thinks, make Ultimate Long Term Strategy early March.

It keeps changed, still see whats special high death count. True! terms global effort, effort that's ever made global pandemic history? isn’t reason. reason Trump focused exclusively re-election CDC weak link. blind spot politics makes vulnerability sure difficult campaign. Trump cares campaign. That’s informs actions.

[This gives great context issue. already IL. We're Phase 4 seem OK far. Thank rising bait. one flash openly carried firearm? Lol. Well yeah, shit constitution intended modified. However, seen hard make OBVIOUS amendments, like, IDK, ERA? They've working one since 1923.

So good luck passing constitutional amendment right allows ban interstate travel. could say thing April May vastly cases even Florida, significantly higher number elderly people (#2 nation behind California).

As many suspected, bug spreads quickly dies quickly. Good, cancel everything forever. (person paid the) Secretary Education going TV announce schools don’t open won’t get federal funds it’s also putting impossible situation. Schools opening going disaster. say parent spouse teacher. one unable empathize care, one may see communists everywhere. fair seem angry one here. longer eat public places? read seem lash everyone rational explanation. You’ll try harder. guess wear mask anymore, so, that's win him.

Now justified police shooting (and would justified even seconds body camera video even Kentucky Governor, he's done great job, Mitch Mob vote soon can. source amnesia thing really scroll dumb shit. Say half million people world wide including friend's 24 year old brother died it.

People like make sick people constantly pushing ""good guys guns"" narrative. is, they're ""good guys"" get want, mentally unstable. glad restaurant owner stood piece trash. think US military anyway strongest world know tell you. Despite much shit hole US can't deny fact spend probably government internationally army. liked part MSB press confence. explained bit use various information channels target people different age groups. Partly due indications people age 70+ felt singled information. also acknowledged age group made big sacrifices pandemic directed extra thank elderly. A) hot Hell. B) social, dining, drinking event end super spreader. Since potentially infected people refused testing, can't make definitive statement like that.

And hard guess refused testing worried testing positive. may good reason worry. we'll never know.

If wise, wear mask assume work. Opening schools totally fucking stupid. Coronavirus gonna rage like wildfire shut properly. strike save lives, lives students, families, pretty much everyone, gonna strike for? even organized? FUCKING STRIKE! every sane person's support!

Really, every union every person consider this. need national shutdown, deluded think federal government going this. Many states counties worst covid problems fine too. need unite show solidarity gonna continue world leader corona fail.

How gonna survive without paychecks? Yeah dunno one. Fucking feudal lords got us financial balls. dunno... somehow rest world handled it. Maybe time get pitchforks eat rich, hope we're there. surprised, honestly. plenty academic material showing little telling someone facts change minds. Backfire Effect much common result - person actually believe viewpoint *more* started conversation.

If want go academic papers this, recommend reading book *Never Split Difference*, written Christopher Voss one top FBI hostage negotiators. book thesis influencing people works, nowhere advice ""Tell someone bunch facts"". much nuanced - specifically around gaining someone's trust listening talking.

In addition Voss, recommend reading *The Righteous Mind* Jonathan Haidt, dives depth people believe believe leads changed minds. adamant - convincing - minds changed telling people bunch facts data.

But hey, might land well hypocritical - telling bunch facts convince facts relevant think. best Reddit comment! you’re going ask regrets CDC policy ship Covid+ patients back nursing homes. sure understand saying? Idaho peeps up, ""don't forget me!"" 1% recovering lot fucking people Labor source wealth. Take binky suck one while. problem wearing mask, order home delivery.

However study done living animal, human otherwise, it’s nothing hang hat yet. mean is. stopped laughing long time ago. pretty damn concerned well now. Fox slowly starting report things go agenda. It’s big part shows fact they’re even referencing stuff means they’re either preparing save face Trump loses election situation bad choice least minimally acknowledge what’s happening.    Society? somewhat notable young person known health issues. may beneficial to,report cases like young people don’t think immune. unfortunately reliving history part allow invalids continue invalid. nothing already uneducated. failed parents communities salvageable people. continue invalids anything dangerous put away continue on. I'm one them. sucks fly anyway, risk getting makes worse. idea anyone would travel nonessentially there's vaccine. normal functioning. Please study country instead. sounds like Devil talk. think evidence reading false. COVID transmits bodily fluids. you’re telling children don’t produce any? age range “children” read *hopefully* peer-reviewed scientific study? elementary aged? Anyone 18? include toddlers? I'm sure ""oofing"" me. got ""if"" ""until.""

Sounds like quite literally one way another me. Well busier tails step side safely away people pass . also choose times less populated don’t go weekends . behind people change pace take break crowding others . reached summits like cascade example Adirondacks. It’s popular high peak (it huge summit) physically don’t go around people . don’t get mad angry others make choices right family . ( side note mean get internally really frustrated see people social distancing wearing masks needed etc. don’t become crazy Karen honestly everyone encountered seems like us . People dying biggest issue. states people died, top ten, democrat led states, even separate NYC NY proper, tenth state list republican run state. 20,351 people died NYC alone + 11,083 NY. even without NYC, New York state would still leading, Texas Florida combined 5891 deaths. saying blood republican, little foolish. going uniting, would say, sides trucked disease beginning, state took different approach, however states shut down, relatively close other, people opened also relatively time. think Red vs Blue issue, Covid attacking everyone, regardless political party, neither strategy worked well enough, opinion Texas better job New York sure, less deaths, simialar population, fact Texas populous state, understand NYC tightly packed, even without NYC, New York state leads death count. Texas 2,654 people died, population-28,995,881, around 0.0092% Texans died, New York excluding NYC 11,083 people died, population-19,453,561, around 0.0569% New Yorkers died. include NYC 20,351 people died, around 0.162% New Yorkers total died. numbers people, want go pointing fingers, go ahead, pointing fingers change people died, going forward, everyone got wear mask, can't socially distance, still got keep economy running, else people go insane.  America: 70k? Hang on! gonna learn real good! holding local officials accountable? Tell what: terrified venture outside world stay home masks forever. rest us get back lives. deaths. virus wreaks havoc hearts respiratory systems even doesn’t kill you. don’t think health system prepared handle decades cardiac problems. Lmao think trump tells CDC whatever wants must understand checks balances. tell Fauci definetely said everything Trump wanted I'm definetely going believe that. mention agencies around world giving similar estimates. I’ll dammed I’m gonna let kids dumb social experiment. It’s 10x worse March absolutely nothing gotten better. Wtf makes think kids can’t spread virus? It’s crazy dumb federal government is, wanna mess economy keep lying people? Fine. children part little experiment federal government wants do. It’s idiotic, selfish shows governments true colors. Maybe didn’t botch whole thing make political crap show, could possibly went back problem.. Nope. Go vote November, nuts . lot protests NYC, cases increased? Think again. Outside big problem. sending kid back school, latest coming long term damage, forget Wow, would've thought it... exposing people pandemic would make it... worse. see source actually great try  3 phases trials goes review/approval phases That's fair question I'm pretty sure researchers thought this...looking forward reading study shit still concerning healthcare connected jobs.

Housing connected higher schooling...

Have guys thought putting important things hand easily changing things, like something can't get fired job say, thrown school. true horror pandemic compromising health potential hoped would able change world ways could not.  virus may killing children robbing future birthright ultimately putting humanity whole risk. Multiple large scale studies US, Europe, Brazil stopped HCQ trials showed benefit beyond placebo fact put subjects lives risk. HCQ discredited months Trump admin completely stopped talking it. anything showed HCQ worked Fox News would headline “TRUMP RIGHT” 24/7. disagree, think important distinguish lot white *conservative* people carrying gun ORDER PROTECT OTHERS himself. Unless course, trying help others, think guns cool. God wish would pepper spray guys throw locked enclosed space understand people trying prove. want wear mask, don't. leave someone asks wear mask establishment.

FTFY flatten curve go up. Right? Right guys? I’ve trying find this. Wherever said it. link something see read ? bunch Michigan Sheriff's outright said enforce mask order law. rebelling governor political reasons entire time. least enforce trespassing person refuses leave business. 


The worst part pandemic one wants enforce it. law enforcement agencies pick choose. AG leaves discretion LEO. businesses caught middle. Please learn history place Canadian comedy bands. first act upon liberating (after virus healthcare obviously) implement proper education system. learn accept spelling words like colour, favourite properly time. rate country going expect president one day. Well fucking said. I'll going bachelor's fishing trip weekend Port O'Connor, Texas. risky 9 guys times COVID-19? we'll fishing, cooking house, relaxing out. Rest world here: social media, too. mistakes government recently made caused community outbreak: exemptions tests quarantine airline cruise crews brought many asymptomatic cases community, total lift eight-people rule restaurants last month also failure,” Hui, respiratory medicine professor, told *Post*.

Mandatory testing quarantine inconvenient travelers. inconvenience nothing comparing safety people business mega city like Hong Kong.  Uh...Saxony United States. Moreover, Germans actually *enforcing* public hygiene. Germany South Korea would never fly US. million years. 

Nice try, Telegraph. guns blazing wrong direction. they'd warning, oh well thanks. I'll mostly stay home wear mask venture out. Easy enough protect myself. Ugh. Hydroxyputinvaccine. great!! getting downvoted? campaigners en force defending him? love watching America burn I've since beginning. sub meant international one, r/CoronaUSA take off, US use instead. Yet many people community (in Florida) think hoax still bad...A even talking longer considered epidemic pandemic. people happy Disney opening back get upset (aka throw tantrum) anyone even suggests people wearing masks public.

Ya right. hard many areas get one, delay testing results diminishes effectiveness testing. Damn... That's I'm surprised Governor add stupidity comment. combination selfishness stupidity. Low cognitive abilities. disregard positive news stay scared keep getting scared like useless daily case numbers. happened media claiming people get infected covid? bet already forgot week media spreading different theory coronavirus might dangerous death itself. many people love bad news life, wellbeing happiness? wants save money comes social programs NY politicians too. We're gonna really weird place election. Like even loses, charges pressed somehow gets pardoned , people gonna lose shit. way hold politicians criminally accountable false promises. Like, want claim children pass infection? fine, it, proven wrong, go prison manslaughter. Make lies criminally punishable law, see politicians act Psyops  Mast wear's

Wut? fault then. scientists screaming pandemic weeks now.

Will take Spanish bloody flu convince people take pandemic seriously? seriously care happens non working elderly?

They're short sighted indecisive. Newsom least took action today shut things again. Abbot even much.  believe main office China. sure hell based America. years apprenticeships they're making money though, world difference. college often looking 4 years school may cost anywhere $50-$150k internship somewhere often free.

With trades often looking 6 months maybe year school less $10k straight paying entry level job.

Thanks. I’m curious poll opinions countries? 

Honestly think much brain’s like “yeah it’s untested could worse long term turn mutant.” stupid sometimes. Paging Mr. Ackman. \m/ Haha true except truckers trains stopping Per study article, non protestors stayed inside more, counteracted increased spread among protestors. Florida living proof really thing ""the good old days Bush."" Florida, like much rest country, downhill train brakes. travesty.  checked Worldometers. Hong Kong 52 new cases yesterday. seem midst ""second wave"", although term relative, since still 300 active cases population 7.5 million (and 8 deaths since pandemic began January). Compare situation Florida. 12,000 new cases yesterday population 20 million, Disney re-opening. Talk big difference seriously side taking control Coronavirus! I’m defending governor. I’m saying smugness face suffering positive trait. maxes 65,535 right? Right? Shit man, that's amazing. Well Canada also huge country tiny population. guys dont metro areas 15 million people.

College ‘college experience’ entirely different things. amount resources made available enormous beyond belief. Much find missed graduate. Use resources you’ll find worth every penny. Go ham college experience don’t wonder walked little show it. 

College isn’t high school. one tell do. easily ask advice receive excellent ones, again, one make anything. Yeah, it’s overpriced, plenty ways knock fraction sticker price variety means.  

Good luck! He’s actually not. hasn’t great, Abbott least closed businesses issued mask order. DeSantis class own. really wish could convince parents fly next month. really give flying fuck feel they're desperate something fun. 

As selfish sounds, I'm allowed enjoy year (i.e. going cons watching sports), neither you. Ha. Show someone thinks cuomo innocent. It’s straw man. Anyone knows anything Trump isn’t going let Trump ruin anyone’s reputation 😂 I'm Florida. remember Florida angry new Yorkers coming here. remember new York dropping ball early, costing many lives, realizing mistake making necessary moves save more. living Florida still thinking New York somehow faked it, along rest world faking it. 

Ban us give moment's thought.

I'll try keep patients alive. chance. Hopefully deliver permanent damage toddler daughter... likely instead heat subduing virus majority America went outside got away other. 

You'll notice worst outbreaks happening hottest states imagine spread large indoors gatherings nobody bothers wear face masks. 

I continually hear absolutely evidence whatsoever corona gives damn temperature. genius! guess start putting bars restaurants schools well. There's going even people dying things usual, hospital capacity treat them. many people \*don't\* die flu every year admitted hospital get medical care? get anyone think possible functional society without functional health care system. absolutely agree. I've many mangers, though, many humility admit employees know better them. extraordinary human trait. Oh know, sounded like something would sub. That’s experience city. brandish get shit America would lose job recourse. Because.. freedom? ironic ask Florida Orange County well. Lol. yes sort of. WTF? shithole live shootings routinely completely ignored police? comes shutdowns, federal government power impose lockdowns nationwide.

Multiple independent fact checks [USA name few, confirmed would constitutional issues Trump (or president) trying impose nationwide lockdown. 

We fucked never cohesive message White House rest country. Trump chance actually authoritarian people listen, decided play role weakman instead. 

Imagine if, back March, White House ""strongly recommended"" national lockdown, emphasizing ultimately governors. Imagine 50 governors page. weeks unified pain. Front-load hurt. suffer bit, truly would ""in together"".

This needed months ago.

The way national lockdown every governor page coordinates together. time March. Good fucking luck now.   Racist ableist? Wtf wrong you? Job postings generally automated based previous person's qualification job before.

Most resume applications actually go hiring manager directly. First becomes part database resumes.

Hiring managers generally pick resumes based best qualifications, pick resumes based similar words used. example, application says

""looking someone flexible able adapt.""

If write...

""flexibe able adapt."" resume, likely chosen database others, increase chances, add similar words related application.

Hiring managers generally even write application, often job they're hiring for, may NOTHING common application requirements.

Simply put, automate top pile copying application requirements resume.

If end getting interview, make sure give hiring manager want. want typist, bring ability speak Japanese, want bookeeper, bring knowledge cinema. private school must offered debate speech logic. Biden came favor M4A tomorrow doubt would seal win November him. popular, American people want it. insurance companies wealthy don't, take guess Biden listening to. Sorry, insane police National Guard stop protests -- we're paying price now.

What intensely moronic thing say. I’m impressed level stupidity manage display. they're aimed feet Oh fk off. Covid killed her. Open shut. deserve reply writing hilarious snarky hell. 💙 Aussies This. People sub acting like matters schools decide open open. They're going try, massive outbreaks quickly happen, they'll close. least getting front try best online. kinda like Purto Rico instead DC least people would wear helmets masks!

You want bet that? without policy less 2,000 would died? one? ""all major outlets""? One fucking study? get one study all? Take meds go bed dude. Why? assholes hide bite marks. might 'plan', work one actually enforcing things.

 problem is, whoever started working plan back April (let alone February) would shit long hard it. wish be. Wuhan got lockdown, can't said Miami. know i'm sounding like jerk say manage recover NY hot pile mess, nursing home issue ONE mistake among thousands good decision.

just clarify i'm trying justify death seniors, i'm saying one deny cuomo's effort NY's recovery. Blame random democrats instead racism says racist, lmao Coloradan here. children’s charter school isn’t implementing masks temperature checks. They’ll “permitted required”. top that, said way they’d make students wear masks government says to, but, “not agree”. parents mostly agreeing think masks communism something. They’re crazy. 100% selfish bastards. wish Polis would stand words mandate masks schools. tRuMp SaYs FlU... mAsKs mUzZlEs, ShEePlE.... wAkE uP... Yea, I've seen study. garbage. Wheres heritage foundation study? national review getting too? mean Tim Apple?  know quite recent grads choosing classes local community/junior colleges instead going university even taking university online classes. one what's point? two lot simply can't afford justify expense anymore. know guy already attending one states flagship universities back home gonna take local community college classes semester. work small office, one thing never considered – spoke friends work big corporate skyscraper-type offices – social distancing enforced, working day long enough big buildings fill empty. lifts can't carry enough people, even employers staggered timing everyone's work days. US shut boarders/international travel arrivals? Western Australia next issues here. entire livelihood dependant upon convincing people eat grilled cheese sandwiches, probably view healthy eating weight loss different lens! Bruh Texas exit chat yet Indeed!    Yeabut, 3 months ""long"" since people could even cope we're back isolating again.

And invariably mouthbreathers start go insane month turn terrorizing populous says opening plans schools ""flexible"" Texas Education Agency (TEA) saying in-person necessary funding. it, Greg? Apparently pretty traumatic disfiguring.   read wikipedia article it.  Even 3 strokes fuck up, give 24. 

But maskless popsicle guy, probably going get either way. Better type guy gym. Nice job that! did, believe UC funds mostly divested sectors negative social perceptions. Probably others.  someone contact yesterday developed fever body aches.

Stop bothering college. make stock market day trading easy fed reserve fake money ever make career degree  Thank you! know appropriate, I'll ask least. moron thinks masks still aren’t useful deserves suffer consequences. 

Problem is, there’ll collateral nonetheless.

Stay safe, Americans. Makes sense. Hopefully antibodies keep infectious regardless.  Exactly. It’s large gathering. may way worthwhile hanging beach friends, virus doesn’t analyze motives. say protests don’t spread covid nonsensical. Right Scott largest ever health insurance FRAUD lawsuit. read another study Henry Ford, ""retrospective observational study"" white house trying use leverage FDA promoting chloroquine AGAIN. Two failures study though: first, account fact chloro group given corticosteroids rate 3X non chloro group (and already know corticosteroids work), second, study discounts much larger NY studies claiming timeline NY giving patients chloro much later, false info. lol here. moved really good area, primarily incredible school district there's much old money area. old money. We're also street private high school, $50k/yr. Makes fucking sense. We're sending kids top notch public schools.

I agree Ivy Leagues smile students schools, again, public schools students wealthy families, Ivies well accounted upon graduation. like path Princeton forged private high school.

I think right another status symbol afford it. check make sure headline ""The Onion""... area bad. zero cost go wife's school. part local school district, charter schools public schools. Hopefully. imagine Florida going well next weeks people going start realizing none hoax, governor shit bed. swat would came black dude Protests help yet rare someone say makes look racist know what's got Brix's head, must strong stuff. surprise Fauci looked China always referred name Brix nicknamed ""that scarf lady"".

But everyone US like that. moved someone asked Fauci he's worried China first vaccine said hell no, would extremely glad sooner anyone come vaccine sooner mankind rid nightmare. Okay, NYC probably close herd immunity time protests; antibody tests said 25% add cell immunity, probably get around 60%

I’m NYC, you’re plain wrong. Oh true forgot Science politics day. Good catch specified. It’s still global slap face way though America disease ridden shithole military spreading countries actually give shit collectively.

Maybe nurses hospital staff start wearing body cams? live-stream shit enough delay blur patients' faces. Wait. surprised. moved *outside country take residence*? 

Cause that's whole thing moving. hard work move 

I also said next impossible, impossible, also responded someone saying moving new country ""an easy decision"". easy decision, easy action. Making light saying ""lol move"" disingenuous extreme. real. last decades we've seen shortages sorts tradesmen average age pretty old. Electricians, plumbers, Hvac...we need wave youth enter professions perfect opportunity make happen. They're good paying jobs minimal school cost.

And like said, lot kids end college business simply that's supposed nowadays. I’m taking online graduate course Harvard (business school) it’s actually outstanding. It’s engaging, challenging (in great ways), I’m learning lot class students. course normally campus moved certain courses online. bit nervous it’s turned good. republican way.  

Destroy support systems cheaper rich pay way pay taxes. Let see damn reviews without signing up! separate issues completely say protests justified, mass gatherings sort high risk activities COVID rapidly circulating country. 

The reason protest justified, mass gatherings whether protest, going church, party, Disney world bad idea. 

It’s thing distinguishing protesters rioters/looters/violence.

I think even REALLY dislike T-man keep track anymore. It’s adult thing normalized unhealthy, you’re told you’re small you’re even upper end healthy weight (or even slightly overweight). Example below:

I 5’9 160lb 25 years old. BMI 23.6. 60-year-old aunt told 50lb underweight looking (that would BMI 31.0). Now, don’t even know BMI is, 38-year-old daughter 5’3 440lb (BMI 77.9) 31-year-old son 6’1 325 lb (BMI 42.9), we’re dealing with. 

She acknowledges daughter heavy doesn’t really talk physical health outlook (she’s mentally ill too, acknowledged half-hearted attempt manage made). said son “a little fluffy could handle lose 25 lbs” (still BMI 39.58, obese class 2 opposed morbid obesity).

Now, I’m 31 weigh 170 (BMI 25.1, slightly overweight angers end go gym twice week attempting drop 2-4 energy-drink six pack Mountain Dew per day habit nothing black coffee water. stay weight wife noticed increase upper body size/tone). Saw aunt day. “Oh face finally filling bit.” “Yeah... need drop ten pounds so.” “You mean you’re need gain ten pounds so.” “No. I’m considered slightly overweight right now, need lose 10lb I’m comfortable.” “No, don’t enough body fat, look arms, you’ll get cold winter.” “Look, working hard get tone military. may always dad bod degree hate run, want solid upper body strength back. job depends strong good shape.” “You skinny military.” “I 155-165 lb military built well enough nobody dared mess solid year got out. wasn’t far all, anything skinny.” “No skinny. You’ll get cold.” “I’ve got winter clothes working heater.” Camp Darwin. ameteur dirt track racing Kansas missouri selling 3k+ tix couple nights week.

I appreciate Dr Fauci try keep bad could be, end day he, Mueller, Bolton, Mattis rest bureaucrats get top spot various fields known loose cannon who'll spill things like boss got fired.

Jesus fucking Christ.

You Covid cultists truly lost minds. Please, get house. despise preponderance wayward followerz less likely wear masks, know quite wear masks.

I even know vøter sewed excellent mask layered perfectly material even holds water like cup (water resistant) still breathable.

I think media covers vøters and/or supporters diverge idiots mask-wearing. IOW, others get media attention. 2.8% case fatality means aren’t testing enough catch asymptomatic mild cases. isn’t good thing course Took seconds realize meant Highlands Ranch Human Resources. 80% Canadians polled recently wanted border stay closed. don’t think they’re even aware tariff mess. It’s revenge. know, disease mentioned people actually wear masks. right! popularized ""plague doctor"" masks others. Hey, supposed announce vaccine first? Blacks wouldnt get shot cops much didnt commit much crime fight cops corona back march lock downs think reaction gladly ignore drs got masks told didnt work strong economy doesn’t equal healthy society. need adopt meaningful ways measuring wellbeing.

Fine whatever “facts” you’ve reading COVID doesn’t affect children much. Children going hundreds chances get exposed COVID. Let’s say one contracts virus. fine eyes right? Well, child still go home parents interact them. Now, parents virus going spread workplace. Early symptoms COVID mistaken “fall flu” unlikely parent child stay home. child spread teachers lot teachers risk die, teaching children? parents risk? Who’s going take care children parents die? Sending children school fall cause COVID grow cause unnecessary lives lost. Schools really choice. going do, fire staff sell half buildings? care reputation school, willing pay normal rate. getting degree. 

If fire staff cut costs go person again? really think people want come back good employees? many people train? quality school drop, meaning degree worth less. sell property, thing probably worse. 

Schools cut many expenses. Can't fire profs classes. Can't fire staff can't run behind scenes processes. really fire janitorial staff, maybe maintenance. really account almost operating costs. close buildings, saving money electricityand heating, per student might dollars.  Everyone cooping uncertain times differently. He's probably panic mode. Relaxation station, aka Covid Induction Station Here’s really shitty communication you. Ha.

I said ideas top head truly havent position choose economic health physical health. Unfortunately dont think get better while. 


This sticky situation. whether protesting partying, going train thought right decide whether lives others worth it.

Bearing mind Black Lives Matter trying point apparent everlasting depreciating standard living lifespan...

But data data. clear MN protestors spread it. seen good CA data yet. shocking people believe racial equality believe science well therefore choose wear masks. anyone confirm wearing 2 masks better one? Also people wear gloves public? Besides fact deaths take happen, takes weeks death get officially-reported records. 

so yeah, people dying large number, lot soon. Per many states' laws, illegal facial covering (mask) carrying firearm. sounds like may individual referring to, though known manner displayed would lead easy misinterpretation.

Heck parked Whole Foods today right two CT Plates Left NY plate right lol

Everyone saying same, including NY friends actually live here. condos generally 2nd homes empty durring time like one street beach, packed. Normally even night hardly see light on, like 3/4 building lit see plenty tags entering leaving gates. building generally quiet till winter time.

I'm machinist know Canada needs more, planning starting program place machinist immigrate everything blew better financial. I'm thinking advancing agenda much aggressive timeline, hopefully B.C. still need machinist early next year. herd immunity, enough population getting sick make disease die due lack hosts. wish term that. Something like herd immunity. new restaurants closing now. difference normally turnover: one closes another opens.

I’m glad teachers far largely spared economic fallout coronavirus schools switch model even make sense continue employ number teachers?


One video lesson could watched 1000 students. Care post facts? Links? Compared last Monday's total 50,584, that's 29% increase cases per day since last week. Ok reopen “eradicating virus”.

Did protesters ""risk other's lives""? Yes. 

Do partygoers ""risk other's lives?"" also yes

I say two groups people morally different. One group _fundamenally_ selfish careless health health others. 

I suggest party people spreading virus qualitatively different people marching peaceful protest systemic problems. 

I stand statement :) Care elaborate? Otherwise comment completely unhelpful. schools closed?  can’t make exceptions risk students teachers get kids back classroom need be? Let’s hope right dudes?

Personally, saunas help get colds quickly. However, would never go public sauna right now. That's recipe disaster.

I bought one home steam sauna things love it. bueno 34,000 people died flu last flu season US calling numbers “skewed” projecting serious grown-up believes cloth mask usage could possibly eradicate virus. maniac loose streets

Nah dude. don’t agree man did; wrong flashing gun. say man (presumably) legally carrying gun waistband “gun-wielding maniac” totally base. sucks lot, best luck SO. Hopefully there's plenty boating go around mess over.  guy crying China thought worth provide idiot facts. Crazy.

China! Yeah, totally. elaborating even though correct terms comparing case numbers directly, picture terms hospitalizations lockdown peak also rather grim AZ, TX FL. 

For three ~8-9x increase hospitalizations present numbers would take *double* available hospital capacity. think practical means create enough ICU hospital surge capacity fast enough cope process unfolding across southern US. 

And would risk locked *today*. want think rcould happen drag feet another weeks... Perhaps right, general sentiment Texas (Austin) far Abbott handled response appropriately. Democrat strongly approve Abbot's handling, honest. time tell.  hear leaves people serious health problems.

That’s thought too. society fixing functional. much space! def get cough checked. want spread hoax mom anything. REPORTED **THIS STUDY**

cmon man... Another one misleading titles heart damage. Read carefully:

This study one covered Newsweek today warn “heart damage” “half Covid patients” flawed defies logic could reported way. study looked patients ALREADY HOSPITAL. 

Let’s use round numbers illustrate wrong is:

Take 100 Covid patients.

Estimated hospitalization rate less ten percent, 10 people. generous based asymptomatic cases, we’ll use it.

According study, 55% hospitalized patients abnormal heart changes. let’s use 6. 

Remember starting denominator 100? 6% heart abnormality Covid infection. That’s half! 14% severe dysfunction, 1.4% Covid patients. 

Here’s problems:

How many heart abnormality precovid?

Do stats adjust age?

What percentage flu/pneumonia patients normally this? 

Is permanent?

For sever patients, prognosis? anyone tell USA shooting virus work? are. school gives homework via youtube. Every class youtube based teachers take forever, possibly days respond emails. crazy. Class Youtube 2020 Says antivaxxer. 

I mean look around. People ""normal"" (status quo?) views vaccines understand *can* dangerous. Especially they're rushed improperly tested. 

But keep beating strawman. Everyone clapping cheering right makes you! Trump would claim joke, ignore fact nobody listens him. Dude small business survived two wild fires CA covid. I’d rather business close permanently start lose people community. Point blank employees lives matter staying open bucks. feels downvote worthy. Rick Scott supposedly Trump's short list VP. lot people saying Pence able stick tongue way farther Trump's sphincter, solidified position number two though. Undetered Pence's talents plenty damage left inflict Florida's ecosystems tourism-based economy, Scott Senator.  bad criminal sent prison Medicaid fraud. question everything “study”. Created? pandemics originated US since I'm bigot like you, would never claim: ""the US created monster"" nickel....  Everyone wants blame Govenor repeatedly going public, refusing social distance, saying wearing mask violation constitutional rights. yeah, DeSantis fault... well document whose work quoting see without holding bunch question marks up. 

I feeling epidemiologist quack. Nonsense. few, any, confirmed re-infections. statistical purposes, happen. America, Fuck Yeah!!! Yeah....

You get license plate contact police. police come collect evidence. press charges, go da, bother, easily go press shame them.

Brandishing firearm something petty ignored. paywall Rural areas immune virus. People's homes might apart still congregate shop, go dinners, etc. Also lot outbreaks rural areas happen farm meat packing workers work close proximity. Also residents rural areas might false sense security since number cases low, end letting guard down.

Those ""off grid"" live almost completely isolated genuinely low risk, caveat get sick help/medical aid also away. less 6ft 10 minutes

I thought schools waste time waiting game. Hated it. Ahh fuck it, in? i’ll drop buck! Let’s make OP millionaire. watching documentary Hong Kong quarantine everyone comes country matter what, even test negative. case test ends positive, person write contacts arrived (example: person take report license plate number taxi driver). quarantine person wear wrist cuff tracks them. People HK also started wearing masks even cases remember SARS 2004. sense responsibility protect fellow men women wearing masks issue. point, think thing convince idiots bad either A) get themselves. B) literally people dying streets en masse. Well think it. Florida warm year round. live cold state, come Florida Winter vacation. People work take care families, genius. everyone sit mommy's basement 12 months. get Trump president pandemic. one man stop thousands people infecting smart? parties going get infected people choosing use measures recommended reason people getting sick. Don’t mad Trump, mad local politicians taking enough action enforcing “mandated” Covid preventions. committed whole comment disappointed. citizens Houston want fired. It’s insane. Try r/COVID19 possible ""find ways safely coexist virus"". Exponential deadly viral growth dominates considerations. IMHE consistently wrong assumes full lockdowns (e.g. Hubei Province) full compliance masks distancing. model robust enough.

I prefer Los Alamos model: Former CVS employee here. labeled feminine hygiene/firearm brandishing aisle. I’m blessed work cemetery. Recession proof. Everyone dies Covid alone

It kind creates feedback loop people see death suffering eyes, truly believe happening (or guess mean really ""register"" them). nurses watch death suffering. news media can't show much make people share experience without lot hassle due Protected Health Information, becomes kind foreign phenomenon people even though happening right backyards. imagine children start dying, furious parents looking extract vengeance. Hope DeSantis got permanent security. Yikes

Disneyland CA still closed thankfully Nyet. Governments always ability regulate group behaviour crises, they're elected. know automatically expect I'm people. 

And also assumptions making false. Ironically percentage cases schools higher percentage cases population. Yeah... Fuck piece shit. Correcting problem. think little late got liquid assets, wait businesses go edge. Roll buy assets tiny fraction they're worth. recession, profit. pants also unconstitutional? Try reading, little.

But reading hard... easier extrapolate poorly written headline. still based somewhat reality mid 80s. dramatically reduced capital gains taxes, retirements shifted 401k white collar pay tied stock options, desire dramatic YOY growth exploded.

Now promise future profit holds weight company stable bottom line. Man, we're part history wrong reasons bad enough people wearing masks, even worse people actually see mask wearing declaration war attack trying safe Nah dedicated guy runs manuals have. Plus I'm CNC Milling team lead sooooo there's that... NY/NJ area definitely vouch that! one point late March / early April, state (NJ) positive test rate 40%. rate people dying Northeast back April, total number cases least 10-20x higher reported. enough test kits back then, sickest patients got tested. Recently, article found one neighborhood NYC two-thirds population Covid antibodies, far higher place tested world, including Bergamo Italy. thought neighborhood may first world reach herd immunity. absolutely doubt NY (and probably also NJ) test capability FL today, would least 50-60k per day. NY death rate around 1,000 per day peak. give ideas many truly infected per day peak. That's true. Immunity may last weeks. more. 

And every infected person potentially going health problems road. Kids great building parental immunity Trade schools cost $$$, too. Even much low-tier in-state college, depending program. MUCH $10K, especially exams/certs. run $1000 pop. 

Right now, cost effective, long-term, lose money due coronavirus. Sorry, numbers pre-COVID. longer apply. College students come better long term, depend degree skills. Tradesmen get knocked illegal labor, especially economy tanks big businesses decide ""tighten belt,"" limited clientele due pandemic. IT, hand, secure, become new trade. 90% infrastructure runs computers. protestors engaged social distancing measures Disney plans implement?

Is masking 100% effective reducing spread Covid19?

Were many protestors wearing masks wearing incorrectly (not covering nose, example)?

Does talking, singing, screaming, chanting, ect. increased likelihood aerosolized particles carriers become airborne?

Do find odd began seeing spikes couple weeks first wave protests? I've thought that. love look lake, living one (for part) bring pretty big property tax bill, I'm crazy part. day make horror movie this. Disney opening, schools, governor saying ""yea, ok, problem, party on."" Oh yea, guess already made movie. need bigger boat. spent 10 years there, really miss sometimes. Never thought would look back fondly times living war zone risking 2 walk frontier living Lead Girard. 

Just look...yeah...it's great. guess optimistic side pop density anywhere close NYC, can't get bad NYC was, right? think spill AZ, pueblo? saw back full lock one them. remember checking months back Cali went lock NYC thick it, bad then, happened? civil war since day Trump took office. Yeah union gonna go strike literally risk dying. T-cells though ""That’s shabby""

Americans really need learn aim higher.

No dig Poland/Slovenia Poland/Slovenia scores better every category US.

This happening one wealthiest countries world. Hi! help you!  guys wear two masks one? thinking wearing surgical mask + kn95 mask I'm going work 8 hours office building. guys think? That's different breed. sympathy doesnt extend them. think # deaths increase hospitals completely packed patients. now, people surviving treatment protocol improved, ICUs full, people can’t treated start dying. bad certainly way many patients Canada, yes. He’s person talking sense US. even short interview national news. shit.

And Trump president country full morons.

Tell world something useful like gonna it? think Giant Meteor born United States? mean testing more, naturally cases logged

There tests, administered people symptoms. means we’ll get higher percentage positives total number daily new cases actual reflection infection rate actually drastically increased since April?

Daily new cases easy way get idea infection rate. Experts believe typically look death rate going skyrocket weeks, due increase actual (versus confirmed) infections?

Deaths lag three weeks. We’ll see deaths rise next two weeks due 4th July infections. mention fucking Disney World opened up. technically, mouse already that, per example Agreed. People short sighted whole thing certainly joke, kind life decisions guys making school?

How accountant make $13/hr?

Why choose graduate degree accounting could've gotten MBA (likely) shorter time opened door management positions? getting CPA soon possible make graduate degree accounting worth it? expected salary approach six figures point?

What plan? Go school hope pays off? doomed country incase zombie outbreak actually happened states close bars public gatherings St Patrick's day. Hell, Ohio cancelled damn primary election couple days later. definitely knew severity point. inb4 ""it's masks kills that's numbers gone up, flu""  state (AZ) announced new testing center near weekend. take care elderly parent. They're still requiring copy insurance card run able get definitive answer wether insurance denies charge still billed. I, parent also wants get tested, afford charge right now. insurance sites make sound like need provider referrals they'll pay. Anyone experience this? Blue Cross Centene. mean, people survive economy... maybe, say, lazy look yourself! Stop following cultural norm expecting others work. Anyway. Moving on. No, Disney reopening problem protest unfortunately. covid-19 avoids protesters whatever reason absolutely ridiculous distinctly American problem.

This simply true, sadly. look Brazil instance. much there: idiotic populist President dismissed ""just flu"" disastrous result. much harder transmit gentle breathing shouting coughing certainly could have. unfortunate take seriously earlier, quick google search shows hit community hard. still good thing they're trying contribute something positive situation now, good example still taking seriously. get license plate number. worker already phone number order placed.


""It call make."" 🤯

If someone threatens *me* gun, *I* calling 911. work school church hospital street tampon aisle CVS.

*Fuck around find out* decides call help. Jarheads scared guns people. ""You going shoot Rona"" comment resonated reason think. cases per capita, Arizona beat. Canadians living USA free enter. I'm Canadian live Michigan. plates car Michigan plates. Don’t need epidemiologist know protests violated cdc guidelines containing spread virus might fewer people thinking hoax. needed expert know that?  Yes absolutely fucking did. Don’t believe second. 

Testers allowed ask people part protests.

This one shitty things happened make people feel guilting protesting. 

Just ask would hundreds thousands people gathering protests wouldn’t spread virus? 

What makes immune spreading it? grammar attention think right despite evidence contrary.  need shouted every time whenever start pushing ignorant beliefs risks people become brainwashed. way safe practices truly enforced weld doors shut people’s houses like Wuhan. It’s sure SMU. It’s cultural happening, lots interesting strategy, plenty fun finishes (see Bristol, Talladega, Kentucky 2020) questioned you...

""Me, me, me"" culture sub is. Texas politically diverse. You’ll find friends shared values.  ""There isn’t evidence Black Lives Matter protests led noticeable increase COVID-19 cases, despite early concerns health officials.

The reasons lack transmission likely protesters outside wind sun wearing masks.

People attend outdoor events, going beach ball game, tend share indoor facilities like bathrooms, shops, restaurants""

This. why. Try reading, little. internship probably 100% important courses. callow lickspittle is. Minneapolis’ spike? matter people follow them... Denver month ago like 40% people wearing masks. shocked. I'm Santa Fe 95% wear masks here, although that's case Albuquerque (it's similar Denver, 40%). Seems vary lot city/town. percent people testing positive keep going up, there's still (sadly) room. 1. New York Minnesota see spikes infections protests.

2. majority protesters wore masks, compared people going bars beaches wear masks. Sweden elderly people US, less at-risk people (diabetic, overweight, high blood pressure) US.

So think people arguing US adopt Swedish strategy Sweden ""fine"" completely wrong. 

If compare deaths age statistics Sweden NYC see Sweden, almost 80% dead 75+, NYC, 65% dead 75+. 

So rest US adopt Swedish strategy, would see lot deaths per capita Sweden, harder protect at-risk population, at-risk population larger, health-care average worse Sweden, sick leave/sick pay benefits way worse Sweden.

NYC stats: stats: Always this. created this? Rich white people late 19th century. outdated system flawed system see. rich modern folks want create system (Crypto) shit stock market. Rich/white collar gambling game tech savvy folks. didn’t know many mayors also epidemiologists Sociopathic window licker? Plus there’s guarantee can’t spread it, even can’t get it. Plus there’s guarantee can’t get again. $150k Zoom education. Feel little better?  Absolute garbage. Get BS here. 

By way, know blow minds...But accepting fact protests contribute spread mean hate meaning behind protests. 

Get real, people. correct answer. Thank goodness financial aid, right? think climate change lol havent heard fucking working Hospital China build Wuhan within one week? 

The US got insane health infrastructure right, use sell liver worst case. Nothing learn US regarding healthcare. Hope see soon! wait till end month, unemployment stops evictions start. got last one get one. Super weird. like

Virus: “Your economy people?”

US: “golf”

Virus: “Ok I’ll then.”  It’s called giving fuck anything. recommended. Maybe. long outdoors emphasis masking.

Or maybe forced everyone else stay home cancelled increase. disappointing. appalling. carry gun. good chance blowing junk upside see ridiculous market pump fact prevents China foreign nations buying controlling stakes companies bargain basement prices. I’m supportive protesting. don’t believe protesting exempt covid risk. don’t think Church exempt either. Essential workers, also risk. narrative protestors contributing to, risk covid, extremely bizarre me. disney world problem. Yep. I'm one them. scares lot especially now. Well I'd go far say necessarily selfishness....it's *softness*. People days soft fuck. want feel ""normal"" matter consequence. Eating out, drinking out, partying, going Disneyland....we make collective sacrifice unprecedented since WWII people can't seem step up. ""inconvenient"". hate shit much anyone since business directly shut (fitness) I've adapted changed things hang there.

Americans 2020 *soft fuck*. That's super neat. link study? hell flagged “Good News” unless moron astoundingly oblivious? problem insulting intelligence is: expect? Everyone smart? Remember, half population IQ 100, definition. can't expect people smart. problem society celebrates idiocy individuality discourages rule-following, listening experts, intellectualism, working good society instead yourself. Every society full idiots; can't get away humans. societies done good job handling pandemic, they've evolved cultures damage idiots minimized, idiots taught listen authorities what's best all. much hate people every time read news story finally realizing wrong shortly death can't help feel bad them.  much would prefer feel sense justice death sense human decency allow it. Can’t wait till Florida starts reporting cases despite tenth population. I’d love see excuses people put forth that. RemindMe! November 7, 2020 ""are hospitals fucked?"" fair, every state peaks. New York already peaked, it’s states peak well. 

Unfortunately, viable option hope herd immunity like Sweden. presidency understands happening won’t mention chaos would bring. We're fucked already happening Michigan.

Bunch crybabies Lol that's messed up. Squeezing us money. We're even getting pay for. state smear attack him. even read article? There’s even bullet points bold, you’re lazy read whole article. SAD Hey, that’s school! think he's trying use reverse psychology. tell people can't it, make want more. say allowed, people like, ""What? giving permission? Well want it!""

give break. There's heavy politics behind universal silence contribution blm protests novel covid spike  stopped watching SNL often obviously missed it, surprised see circulating around! Thanks! :) CDC estimate 2 deaths per 100,000 infections isn’t IFR 0.002%? I’m originally I’ve heard one told. :) true average person Texas. care bc people becoming ill could prevented. wonder election affected number republicans becoming ill unable vote yet people never Disney seen what's happening inside shitting n opening 0.1 fatality rate still like 13K deaths. Y’all going fine. flattening curve. clusters test, trace, contain strategy well oiled machine Canada across provinces. watched lot protests. news stories, live feeds. guess 50-70% people masked. large percentage, still massive overall number people not. protests long, hours hours. Days days. Yes, people moved around, talking viral load, can't imagine yelling, singing, screaming multiple times dangerous conversations picture above. like guy picturesd, take it. Imagine protestors standing close. Would people say high risk? trying get bottom risk outdoors, impossible get real answers. huge disservice Americans trying navigate pandemic families. We're pawns election. Either side would happily lose million people ensured win. f'd. Libs ever read one book

I swear way left finally reach ""Harry Potter plight proletariat"" Yes..... BUT.....*jumps window* Saturday big day. fully realizes masses Texas want immediately (who understand seriousness virus want live) staying safe homes following strict orders own. powerless right now. knows soaking every second it.

We trapped. People getting sick and/or dying around us witness pure evil seen since World War 2 know who. curiosity, wear mask then? Unethical clinical trials fast! Cheers guy. Put charge. Exactly. sick overly optimistic people. use 0.5 somehow delude thinking won’t apocalyptic. 

0.5 true. Every country different millions obese people, IFR certainly higher. Maybe disease progresses slowly think? scientists turned trolling art!! Seems like youre working really hard discredit doctors. Maybe reading article. I'm sure there's source badger. Lol. looked judgingly car W Florida plates July 3. Maybe 😀 Maybe states Fed government hadn’t defunded higher education country, costs wouldn’t put backs students families. understand costs don’t disappear students aren’t campus? completely agree you, frustrating talking people disagree. feel like hard, everyone else too.

What really understand people drive around cars, alone, wearing mask. Totally unnecessary useless. Wait understand joke. Please elaborate tricky subject. BLM protests just, also feel like dishonest say contributed nothing. time, understand people want admit give inch, protests get blamed 100% worst possible actors and/or lumped anti-maskers Disney park-goers there's equivalence purpose. political.

A person walked said, ""Hey nutball, Covid coming, social distance!""

The religious nut replied, ""God keep safe.""

Another person walked box full masks. ""Hey nutty take mask.""

The religious nut replied, ""God keep safe.""

Two weeks later religious nut died covid-19 met God. ""You supposed keep safe, die?"" Asked religious nut.

""I sent somebody tell social distance, another person bunch masks. get you?"" Replied God.

Tracers allowed ask people attended protests. 

Oh dear, what's this? article demonstrating surge cases young people New curious. surges covid cities places protests held? 

Like Phoenix

and LA

and Houston

and Miami

and Chicago

and Atlanta

and FL, AZ, CA, TX

It's ok say protests spread COVID. mayors LA Miami even admitted such. Again, saying protests spread virus means social distancing, powerful weapon preventing transmission, unnecessary prevent spread. Me. Too. get started? That’s got sarcasm like think also typed search query 3 found nothing close mention higher mask usage doubt it

Enjoy day It’s people think 911 Sandy Hook we’re inside jobs.

They aren’t going believe Coronavirus exists it. 

I can’t believe much Trump kool-aid they’ve drunk. 

Doctors scientists bad guys. guys keep kicking American he’s education I’ll keep taking hits agreeing go then. 

I already pretty clear never said great, said improving Devos took over, lol. can't even post one fucking article data set back shit. fuck even say? read rest posts baseless opinions backed nothing. nothing anyone.

No intel. insiders. insight. --- fuck point existence? perpetuate nonsense play dick?

You moving needle anywhere way, subreddits part of. Except maybe gaming sub, huge waste time tells world EXACTLY priorities lie.

So fuck even posting anything? aim purpose? naysayer default? Completely pathetic. deserve voice this.

I can't stand pieces shit. need skulls smashed in. maybe microchip mask rest life. GREAT IDEA. Cucks. article says didn’t contribute NOTICEABLE surge. NOTICEABLE expletive. Outdoors, masks worn, sharing much indoor space differentiates protests public gatherings like ball game. guns - taps forehead top either. drumpster fire president leadership top unmitigated disaster area. Bad leaders continue double bad decisions, refuse take ounce accountability things predictably snowball. really disgusting experience. going put them? opening field hospital back up? sounds plausible. never want hear Philadelphia liberty bond parade epidemiologist again.

I think bigger concern official toleration even participation protests signal sent everyone fine disregard pandemic control measures - did. guy talking said wear masks stunt kids' immune system around kids' germs. mean people want protest inside since they’re told can’t? Like Broadway star Nick Cordero then... think going outbid barons? Man guys fucking naive... 
You thousands dollars savings shit hundreds thousands folks going bid hundreds millions billions. Good luck. 

The property going able buy ghost towns less value. 

Here part barons buy properties think come shady tactics like past? ""Why laws people follow them?""

*- Governor Abbott, basically* thinking maybe trying prolong crisis could solve nick time election get reelected, looking like hero. second thought, would require long-term strategic thinking, I'm sure he's capable that. really one part one line...oh damn, it......OH YEAH: .....MOST WEARING MASKS. 

WEAR FUCKING MASK. KEEPS EVERYONE SAFER. Canadian asking here, Orange County Florida California something? That’s studies suggest, based countries. good luck convincing people it’s true. one sharing Russian vaccines successful trails news? Reddit America news? Athletes average virus much bigger risk heath issues law averages doesn’t apply Yeaaaa, stabilize 10k new cases day. There’s testing capacity right locally nationally. Quest running 7 day turnarounds point. whats really weird. Every fucking state protest, aome reason five seeing large spikes.

What happened!? NYC proof protests aren’t contributing. massive protests still keeping lid cases. Amen!  Wild people consciously cast votes enormous dumbasses. It’s one reasons hear people say won’t wear mask believe it’s hoax. It’s unbelievable. drink water almost anytime like. Disney allows masks eating drinking.  

Stores AC open Disney World many lines indoors AC. AC rides indoors. park also limited hours done much quickly since lines short compared normal. Also, many guests onsite retreat middle day hotel room. Locals go home come back time future.

The indoor zones need mask on. bigger issue closing indoor dining.  

But know agree park closed silly go back forth issue could save lives adequate solutions.  

And anyone poor health risk categories (including senior citizens) choosing go Disney World. Disney disclaimer guest assumes risk COVID parks. one going, that's choice. Maybe Ukraine something him. /s know certain places 1% entire population died?

If thing invected people 40, yeah would less 1%. get control infects age groups.  surge cases NYC protests then? breathing issues face starts burning hour times I've worn one hour rash. Even wearing one couple hours week getting breakouts along chin upper neck much days hurts tilt head. Typically wear scarves (or anything high necks could touch face), keep hair face time I'm sweaty I'm fine, masks physically hurt though (and sort soft cotton ones LOT less painful disposable ones). wear one I'm near people, I'm going start wearing one go get mail go walk like people seem think should. really low bar pass competent this... many failing it... remember going Job interviews March 2009 Dow dipping 6000's. fuck hiring fresh college grad back then? somehow found one field, drive hour way. Ya gotta ya gotta do. paid end. Well we're getting another shutdown whether like half restaurants town shut workers infected. hell going go eat bars restaurants staffed infected zombies, anyway? Man, burns rights ass it. Look comments. much incredulousness BLM spontaneously organize safer events ""leaders"" plan months advance. Stockton Unified CA announced online learning 2020-2021 school year couple hours ago. k-6 specials teacher, teaching curriculum virtually well school helping 'masking breaks' kids go outside take masks off, cleaning.

So sad virus done. Somebody needs shout asshole next press conference. teachers parents think children learn better partial classes partial students part time anyway? parent surveys showing grades handful returning, grades 90% can't fit classrooms distancing.

This crazy!

But hey, let's school middle pandemic fall winter coming. Okay, NYC probably close herd immunity time protests; antibody tests said 25% add cell immunity, probably get around 60% grandparents never leave retirement home room rate True. 

But even political interference increases dissociate Covid-19 related deaths disease coming months, mathematicians, actuaries, epidemiologists, educated experts see smokescreens political interests raise.

Truth succomb lies obfuscation, even though many people's lives sacrificed upon altar political propaganda.

No well-attired spin doctors standing upon national stage ensconced flag patriotic vitriol able bring back dead could saved science medicine allowed stem pandemic. NYC probably close herd immunity time protests; antibody tests said 25% add cell immunity, probably get around 60% actually wanted egg more, think getting it. let clear:
After first answer knew type person are. accept scientific sources anyway, try post form argument even want have? answered question that's it. Discussion me. know wanted know anything gain discussion topic thread. 

But googled know least 7800km me. nice. Hey want something lot stupider Ohio anti mask rally 18th want know real kicker bottom post says mask optional Frankly I’m worried keeping day job catching virus, it’s kinda selfish, yeah I’d like stay open too.
 
 
To fair, wouldn’t expect anybody else look best interests either last 4 years proven anything, everybody selfish AF. probably higher rate Americans wanting move Canada now. 

This spring, got accepted Univ. Toronto grad school turned down. regret it. We're refugees escaping crazy bastard state- we're like swear LOL Dr Fauci could happened countries. national experts provide updates Youtube podcasts part official system highly respected:- 

The UK Dr John Campbell 
Australia Dr Norman Swan Well kinda did. provinces shutdown travel provinces forbidden. cops blocking roadways. things pretty normal, he'll freeze anybody wants us borders open fuck one talking Georgia kemp literally done nothing  Newsom's right me. 

I also say name way said Bobby Newport's park n rec.

*Gavin Newsom* well said. put thoughts words. Americans nowadays bunch pansy-ass-bitches. Yes guarantee anyone buy provinces. BC Quebec provinces huge there’s lots vacant land especially north. fact, even Vancouver many foreigners buy condos don’t even live them.

This PEI thing must function tiny size. Lol said 54th 50 states. I'm done can't handle anymore stupidity tonight. I've joking lot lately every time becomes less joke. ""dumb US Representative""

Stupidity elected officials highly contagious disease that's talked enough. Protests, like social activities, lead potential increase cases. However, understand spread COVID 3 months ago (which still fully understood) since science data-based, things continue change.

We know covid needs ""close contact"", defined 10 minutes 6 ft less, spread. protests outdoors, generally, walking, constantly changing viral load vicinity.

At church, sit next group people 30min - 1 hour (depending service). Essential workers, generally work environment entire 4-8 hour shift.

So protests contribute, vector transmission lower, due decreased viral load acquire.

Edit: Adding units time. agree. Mass gatherings kind seem stupid shit right now. reaction 50 cases. Meanwhile FL... called brandishing. law places. here. gotten previous alerts, nothing today. Looks like we’re going bumbling influenza season already-full hospitals. 
This winter shaping slow-motion, preventable health catastrophe epic proportions. large portion american populace fed disinformation, albeit domestic foreign, there's huge portion literally lives different reality. union told us, HIPAA protection. one ask accommodation. Personally, brain aneurysm coiled blood clots go reason. That's cool stay home w kids 8-3pm, lot us can't Sorry lost. need get rid food service entirely IMO. serve everyone time, everyone goes maskless eat / drink time. Big fail. *minimum* could serve different sections plane different times limit many people masks once. Something like 10 minute wait thirds cabin like.  report that? Maybe different US type things generally rather pointless.

It's law tell responsible for. get decide that.

""By visiting restaurant voluntary assume risks related exposure food poisoning.""

Yea, good luck that. closed subsidizing people population go bankrupt disruption, damned. US spent trillions aid, locked fully early given money individuals businesses basis cannot fire single person, safe, opening seamless since everyone goes right back jobs, unemployment go up, people pay lives meantime. 

It also would cheaper, use Canada's COVID spending comparison. also hits American ideas equality -- unemployed ones lose jobs get stimulus government employed continue paid partly government support. tunnels park. staff change costumes refresh make there. Serious medical emergencies deaths handled park too. least ordering real second shutdown, unlike every state really is. work FL hotspot today two teenagers weren’t wearing masks all. Even though signs say need wear one. Like seriously fucking little kids serious two teens. people still universal healthcare bad? 

dumbfucks.  know what’s worst part? man walked restaurant knowing he’d asked wear mask. drove way knowing response he’d show gun intimidation tool.

How normal adult think one time entire time “you know what? Maybe I’ll order delivery”  Online class awful. literally impossible learn stuff need know major in-front computer. fair us pay full price online class. party think would be? everyone wears masks day living No.... gen Z getting fucked economy.

Trump already stirring pot saying election setup. Mail-in-ballots faked. Trump loses landslide, results discredited. way. We're going another 10 trillion debt.

It's going much worse unless riding one out, experts need use wisdom help us try live this.

You pay us fuck smart write white paper loose hundreds thousands people keep economy afloat. Fuck might win noble prize showing economies grow fewer consumers. bet home value effected dead people's houses go market.

As expert - eat fucking vegetables. refused eat three months ago still sitting table cold rotting longer refuse eat rancid become end day eating fucking vegitables. USA screwed don’t think going back normal going work vaccine. 

They bars restaurants right Florida Texas bars restaurants months too. proper distancing, masking, etc possible normal society probably doesn’t include bars. Kids school digital age. Kids need know learn communicate computer. Parents need make sure teachers BABYSITTERS. Human lives important education students receive face face learning disruptive classrooms. think scientists around world slowly unraveling sinister virus is..being family history heart conditions i'm definetly noping clubs bars vaccine least concerning behavior video article states governor ""came fire weekend"" statement. remember Italy months ago?

""I'm getting word someone graduation party. We'll send police. We'll send flamethrower""

And 400 deaths per day. Yesterday US: 465 reported deaths.

  Redfit problems colliding narratives sometimes. can't say people marching outside spreading people beaches are. I’d like think that, frankly isn’t true.
 
 
Lupe Valdez lost Abbott 14%, Beto vastly outperformed Texas lose 2.5%.
 
 
Texas still much right-wing state, though lean left, still nearly voted Abbott (I didn’t though.) report company violation order. Go state’s COVID website find details how.  Bigly true... Propaganda? Lol proven Snopes admitted fiance's boss owner small home remodeling company. fiancee coworker (the employees) refused work April, officially furloughed. begged come back worker did. refused let go immunocompromised cannot risk it. I've 2 surgeries since March scared everything. see person store without mask, improperly makes angry. 

His boss still work, going house house. matter time family become infected. would expect person like send kids school. sad people think money health there's absolutely changing minds. couldn’t summed Texas better. Bravo winter gonna scary fuck! always get sick november december every year. I'm seriously thinking taking two months off. People U.S give shit till half population dead.Covid deff gonna run rampent till winter, spread like hell due cold. countries don’t follow US constitution kind reasoning deranged: go wrong America? When?

It's new. think started Baby Boomers (who today largely part problem). Remember, 1980s called ""Me Generation"". America long society ethos ""Fuck you, got mine."" Hey! went high school rankin county. family member works private college ~5,000 students. 4th told late June school staring $30mm budget shortfall consequently big round layoffs early July. modeling full re-enrollment Fall, happen would another round layoffs.

Not sure school's plan moment - classes person online. I'm guessing they're pushing ahead person fear online would drive enrollment require cutting. Arizona....chiming in...nothing see here... grew Kansas City though majority fine people lot kind people exist well. ""I'm asking questions"" ignore answers tell I'm wrong. ""Just research"" listen folks agree ignorance.  Whelp. watching gotta say Abbott definitely dangerous liar irresponsible broadcast him. said wearing mask good immunity absurdly false definitely encourage people rely masks carelessly. think meant everyone wearing masks would good even dangerous hyperbole might encourage irresponsible behavior much reliance masks.

Then goes ""how would enforce lockdown"" immediately answers rhetorical question mask enforcement.

What reveals this: Abbott command kind authority Texas initiate lockdown Cuomo commanded NY. least, time may get way local authorities enforcing policies. would put Governor? surge NY happened lockdown, huge chunk population already got infected. larger percentage area US based antibody tests. data suggest 20-40% population antibodies starts slow spread virus. quite possible NY already achieved that.

60000 people Houston gathered streets protests place overrun. One example “not happening” doesn’t mean anything. amount people gathering going cause virus spread, it’s basic science. doesn’t mean people don’t support cause. got number direct CDC. Oh give fucking break.  calling people cowards things help mitigate spread virus.  people listened start none would happening right now. Kids growing poverty urban areas far likely asthma, live food deserts, lack access health care. Pretty much every country done regional closures sort. Canada, Australia, Spain, France, Germany, Italy done sort regional/State border closures.

The EU shut borders member States. open borders one biggest things EU/Schengen Area people know about. everyone agreed global crisis limits ""freedom travel"" temporarily necessary. Death cures stupid. totally get pain frustration blatant ignorance selfishness entire country. I’m assuming you’re US I.

But here’s thing. You’re alone I’ve honestly similar thoughts. want go data analytics sports right seems like sports may never come back. know will. I’ll tell why...

Truth told, world gone WAYY worse pandemics significantly less technology ability fight it. greatest scientists working together unprecedented speeds end it!

Guess what? got it! rough along way that’s life about! 
Getting challenges! 

People gotta understand things get better. Things go back similar way things before, it’s matter when. It’ll take time! promise you’ll live life worth living. life about. Keep head keep pushing forward. 

In honesty, get sub. It’s pessimistic sub could right now. always like reading progress vaccines treatments it’s honestly insane fast they’re working get life back normal.

Don’t listen people say “life never go back way was.” course won’t! Life BETTER honestly cleaner said done.

Keep head keep pushing. You’ll fine!! didnt praise protests. cause may good, pandemic bad time it. one making students pay anything.

Yeah want chance decent economic future pay. future. Texas Democrat 2020. Congrats president biden. deaths low today yesterday? approaching 1k days ago, weekend reporting lag? sounds like corruption-induced vulnerability. Texan here. confirm. :( Hasn’t warning last weeks without actions? Famous last words. That’s CMS, CDC?  I’m still concerned reading ability. got awfully defensive didn’t read first comment, proposed source wasn’t even tried state was. 

54th 45th, admit mistake. Theyre definitely outliers, think people taking virus seriously need see things like this. convinced one anti-mask friends stop fuckstick story days ago guy 30s posted wearing mask died. still never answered question. many protests personally attended observed masking? I’ll wait. I’ve protests happening around Denver capitol, I’ve noticed massive mask wearing plenty distancing precautions taken protestors. People handing sanitizer, masks, need them. Sounds like think Polis personally shoved stick ass something. take temporary measures make sure pandemic doesn’t completely consume us affront personal liberty? kind make fucking sense I’m tired nonsense. mask nothing minor inconvenience folks treating like it’s going codified permanent law something. I've got one word you: blatantly obvious Russia cutting corners, compromising standards exist good reason, fabricating results. claim gone human trials less month. That's even close works. idea mid-term long-term impacts might be. Day one, Biden better task force place deal racism health financial crisis caused pandemic. hear Brazil North Korea still consider us comrades. wait fall/winter everyone inside cold. going brutal. never heard ""buy hype, sell news""?? He’s got Twitter that. How? trump rallies according media leans Red develops Colorado turns blue following little little. miss Gate's bbq DeSantis looks like he’s brink breakdown lol Wish lived Canada everyone upset about? like every single person florida dies, country going really affected. average iq gdp might even go lmao definitely leftist joke libs. Yes, do! likely adenovirus coronavirus protein mapped 30k 07/19
Maximums Florida Sundays See: America, United States social cause. Welcome America, appear new here. Take seat don’t worry stupid mask. love freedom common sense social responsibility, much love select group statues. You’re shot hole countries ya? tried banning coming in, jokes us we’re ones banned now. least got freedom kate-stage capitalism! Love response. actions deflationary let's real, 2020, they're going send us stagflationary period. Everything else said, I'm board with. go war end this. history. 10+ days results “here” PA don’t even big problem relative states. country acted like pandemics big deal tears important... takes 4 6 weeks death rate increase case rate increases (the exact timing somewhat uncertain, definitely lag. aligns timing US death increases saw starting last week). best example found Iran. Go look Worldometers. decline cases sharp increase, like US. makes easy see lag deaths start increase. 4-6 weeks (the increase deaths gradual say 4-6 weeks there' sharp inflection death rate. definitely went back though!)  What? You’re claiming majority doctors don’t care patients?  lockdowns Spain like two months. long time even go wide, open, empty beach. they're bringing new lockdowns wear masks even outside street. risk seems mostly indoors. crazy media made everyone lose mind 300 scientists wrote letter gladly politicians starting listen. Good caring. 

I teach high school students could give rat's ass long end A- end semester. weak ones, Wikipedia works well home school's internet connection. Florida, got time work tans. Good time move parents work together keep family safe. Yep, huge reason. republicans saw Democrats gathering stupid numbers never convinced change view masks. people didn’t want insensitive outrage. 

Fucking stupid beyond reckless.

Edit : don’t say protests weren’t important. It’s incredibly reckless pandemic unfortunately, like not. Spread virus massively. Right. They're screwed. say protests contributed (which likely did) people say, ""it protests, easing restrictions"". say protests contribute surge people say, , ""I guess large outdoor gatherings aok."" Florida man laughs progressives Cali  Soviet Russia, coronavirus gets vaccine you. Contact tracing. Practically nothing protests. Many events related bars, restaurants, family gatherings. Good luck blurred out? towing Trump line hiding people do. talked physician gastric bypass option? actually doesn’t opinion. article outdated something. APS announced distance learning like 3 days ago. always vote. I’ll probably vote 3rd party year, vote far left ticket. “If don’t vote you’re voting x” isn’t logical statement. don’t vote, didn’t vote. 

Regardless ballot cast, going continue struggle COVID. *everyone* access healthcare services, nightmare *will stop.* Holy shit would terrifying. mean, he's right. reddit MO go grain feel fake intellectual..they different fake woke people virtue signal read twitter headlines. guy knew, look hat - huge G wearing start shit, polarizing item today's world, pretend ignorant know G controversial like showing gun asked comply simple rule everyone supposed follow. Fuck guy, maybe luck soon hear story town, pulled gets dropped someone else carrying took actions threat meant. Teachers need go strike.  may power keep schools closed make sure complicit murdering families children teach. Trump force schools open kingdom come mean parents going send kids there. That’s smart decision. wish people level logic reasoning..

Not mention heart one organ - virus attacks kidneys, lungs, brain, pancreas... it’s concerning. I’m interested see future studies this. Chuck Testa Russian I'm it. We're gonna learn something  Bro live FoCo work Greeley. comparison Well cities highest affected areas, cities almost always predominantly democrat. Correlation governors careless this? lucky coincidence reds? Ask [vets who've that's working out.  saw story Reddit couple went hospital get tested covet. One paid $199 cash, person health insurance pay it. Second person got insurance bill $6,000 insured's portion $1,500. schools sizable endowments amounting several years (or more) operating expenses. don’t want dig use returns revenue source. really. things done civil service don’t require anything executive branch. actually requested many things Carrie team either refused slow implement. border controls ppe supplies. quarantining measures restrictions gov basically ignored health professionals. medical sector even strike get listen. mostly concerned using situation clamp free speech. Maybe? dream scenario would every single covid casualties come back zombies devour body like general Rhodes Day Dead Yea see lot people ignoring LA bashing Florida Texas. guess it’s understandable Florida Texas stubborn lockdowns mask wearing LA part not. begs question, virus spiking LA? protests right? Maybe beaches open? Either way people LA irresponsible don’t hear sub reddit really talk it. People don’t seem want admit although good cause marches irresponsible caused people die get sick. It’s sad politicking instead taking serious health issue. man's actions would probably qualify menacing brandishing, flashing gun context would crime almost anywhere. hold there. people Texas running, too. Florida probably win opened Disney. became ago climate ""skeptics"", vaccine ""skeptics"" globe ""skeptics"".

These days skeptic someone gets info random blogs. hell anything? free countries freedom travel. place temporary restrictions times crisis. 

Difference is. America refuses call crisis. Can't call else poor stock market badly! getting meta me. see picture mask finished cup coffee? Funny thought outdoors? Australian here. locked states non essential travel hotspots (Why think go police hospitals Im sure, hell essential services even bottleshops open whole time, need extreme). still locked, rightly so. state leaders see fit court orders. certainly help control virus almost stopped stopped community transmission them, prevented country wide outbreak protected indigenous rural communities. wrong....

Eta. Elaborated. Curve flattened then? R 1000% less zero

Maybe use words understand.

* 1000% 0 still 0 

* R can't less 0 (I mean understand can't infect negative number people right?) dont get shit CA UI. Fed 600 keeping going.

Fuck Senate GOP. Florida man supports observe, record report actually happened instead assuming. Please, it’s Venus syndrome Christmas. It’s over. larimer county - super hit miss depending business, mask wearing seems trending :( vaccine reaches states, I'd imagine we'd tests first, right? media certainly Make Canada ~~Great~~ Healthy Again... I'm DMV, one largest protest, see sharp spike COVID yet 

in hand, West Virginia Delaware opposite... maybe could be... controversial? Probably. Rick Scott became Governor company settled largest ever health insurance lawsuit. Floridians decided Senator. Actually, places better live America. Europe really nice. 3rd world shitholes amazing cash. think remote working become much common starlink satalite allow global travel. short glorious time amazing, probably get outsourced done AI. that's happening work anyway. poor. $13 accounting job getting royally fucked. Please Fuck, can't even make final moments peaceful?? Fuck... least something know, think Texas seen enough shit last decade finally starting wake what's happening. Abbott 56% last election Ted Cruz beat Beto percent. Things changing. Texas' biggest challenge right gerrymandered pieces last decades Republicans. repeating exactly said March?

In March says people save masks sick healthcare workers. months later he’s saying “I said people save masks sick healthcare workers”. doesn’t seem inconsistent me. Kentucky pastor Dana Coverstone strange prophetic dreams emphasizing 2020 months March (COVID-19 hits USA) June (racial unrest) , September (???), November (gun violence involving Russian troops Chinese troops USA soil presidential election). dreams started late 2019, hope dreams BS. article gift keeps giving, especially time goes on. creatively blocked art student slowly getting back, lying kick ass get gear found creating again. lot freinds also depressed somehow managed produce cool works time. interesting moment reflect lot things around us. Art history bit stagnant last decade imo, already making people see things different way, one new look internet.

I hope SOMETHING positive comes tragedy.  They're huge risk getting infected themselves. Innocents paying price yet GOP ignorance. makes sense!!! people wear masks? Dr Fauci said:-

""I know anything economics - know lot infectious diseases""

(I'm misquoting somewhat ...) oppose metric system? Thank you, hope too. Times getting hard could use time him. “New study shows masks decrease spread” 

“scientist says cases spiked opened early”

“Virus spreads large crowds, avoid indoor gatherings”

“Death count rising following weeks increased infection”

Im sick reading headlines July barely news April. learned lesson yet. point it’s willful ignorance Lol fuck going pay Lots NJ plates NC difficult teachers dead. He's literal Bond villain Right would think breathing problem would want protect covid. blame media remember running new stores first saying wear masks wear mask might get dizzy... Everything fucked going dealing covid years now.  going college last semester dad died best fucking decision I've ever made. avoided ungodly clusterfuck covid19 online learning.  part union talk rep. Let know concerns. 

A lot time teachers' unions support help lesser unions worried union strong enough make difference. would federal issue, except federal leader (Trump) incompetent handle aspect anything devolved state issue.

It's global problem national crisis US. national leadership currently process stabbing Fauci - one good person - back. Except never 100. like 75, wined 100, went back 0. 

We half-assed thing beggining. amount stock people put federal governments entirely unsettling. government doesn’t dictate every aspect life you!! 1 leader says doesn’t dictate life. goal posts keep moving.

This started quarantine spread curve.... done. goal posts never shut everything save everyone. goal never sit home there’s vaccine. That’s it’s become. realize wearing mask. Living like everything’s “normal” much protest anything else. think Trump put onus states? He’s utilized federalized system U.S. government employs... American right adverse strong central government. Right chaos it’s perfect time governments puff chests. Amazingly Trump done opposite told responsibility states towns people. 

What’s endgame here? Really goal? sit back wait governments say okay allowing privilege living again... that’s U.S. operates. might unrefined might “Wild Wild West” end day it’s exactly free world needs. you’re ever vigilantly defending you’re rights.. nobody is. US consumer spending health economy - inflate assets want that's going stop demand destruction coming pipeline. Yeah, like $1200 buy one avocado toast! chump change, millennials split them. please bring something little intelligent table. feel like comment lacking. 4 Chan needs mods case you’re looking. Low effort hate trump normal reason doesn’t fly. Stay classy know nothing politics team phone big enough see naked eye. milli-tracker best. Border closed. Knocked door like half hour.

Then check model Columbia small rural states hitting numbers countries hit. guys beautiful, happy you! Interstate travel protected constitution truth age sides infuriated it. Stop equating profession/educational pedigree intelligence. 

Both much product growing upper class. work attorneys every day. lot extremely dumb despite glut knowledge around specific subject. Agreed. saw people virus-denying sub basically saying ""the death rate increased cares little?""

I mean, fuck, 100k deaths. They're literally ""I'm one dying care."" Ive hunkered cali desert rural area past years. feeling something bad gonna happen us. Glad im kickin’ middle nowhere atm. know you, last school year ""distance learning"" handful hastily gathered URLs sent morning, hour actual teacher time via Zoom per *week*. fucking joke. know teachers months parents tried work home (or find work laid off) teach damned kids. schools better step game dramatically things get ugly fast. China authoritarian dictatorship somehow can’t properly regulate wet markets prevent infectious diseases getting loose. Chinese government absolutely responsibility this. fortunate travel lot, love exploring world. Live paradise Key West, love too!  ""Choke 'em!!!"" shadow government, party power.

Since USA executive branch, shadow government really work. US uses ""minority senate"" terms like that, similar shadow government.

See Aus, Opposition Leader, Shadow Health Minister, Shadow Defense Minister etc etc. They're secret government haha. don’t think sounds selfish all. vigilant staying home following rules some, it’s frustrating trying deal people go normal summers I’m stuck home. It’s exact reason emotional breakdowns I’ve since quarantine started. touch anything stuff bought last time there. Using Google Pay. Unlocked phone 6 inches keypad told moving fast, held deliberately registered paid. guy offered receipt told eat it.  It’s month now. really like new ""infected children can't infect people"" narrative pushed order open American schools. extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence, requires fully proven explanation *why* particular virus unique children unable spread it. that's almost certainly bullshit derived cherry-picked data presented dishonestly. been. Measles, polio, smallpox others Turnaround time would quicker less people needing tests. asshole. Travel bubbles, many already discussion. Zhang refers dividing world 1st world 2nd world according well control COVID-19 within border.

The challenge safely interact bubbles. mean... what’s point prevent death? Fuck dude. pretending care trying drive traffic conspiracy sub. entire comment history advertising sub. banned Idiocy COVID II: Electric Boogaloo Hire people get rid backlog. Politicians order shutdown now, wait weeks virus them. we’ve seen inside Disney, reduced crowds understatement. Place looks empty. cannot possibly stupid ignore evidence COVID19 spread massive potential spread within schools vector. must another sinister agenda resumption children's education. Karen’s strong Orange County. see Europeans/Canadians fighting masks way Americans do. Yes, anti-lockdown protests countries. anti-maskers? many them? know idiots everywhere U.S. seems saturated it, least area Florida. numbers look like work first-world country. even reached peak yet. state looks like work someone gave up.

This issue practically non-existent Asian countries (and they're better us)- work team there. That's I'm sayin'  remember. forgiven. Reality is, 10K people sub, many took seriously. prepared fought pushed back - people China posting everything fake, downplaying, etc. Remember that? one strangest times. 

Videos lines hospitals people dying streets, would post wasn’t real, actors. would jump personally said anything sounded remotely negative China covering things up.

What worse back then, telling everyone cared get ready, stock up, coming hit US hard... every single person laughed and/or ignored you. Yeah. sucked. maybe Tesla profit Came comment. Remembered I’m Texas....sitting ass back down. taking crazy pills think $200K well city US, even NYC, pulling $200K hurting anything (or, *really* bad money.) intervention gets R barely 1, keep years years without ever getting bored letting pressure. Apparently Canadian fly USA. cant cross land border entries. Maybe look that. get need strictly quaranteen alone 14 days. Where's video? need one right true. super easy fast get tested wisconsin.  find helpful know unpatrolled borders neighbours lenient risk management. US-Canada border definitely coming mind. people don’t waste $1,200 avocado toast, stimulus check get everyone calendar year! deal anti-vaxxers, Australian government decided child tax rebate would given proof vaccination.

We lost 80% anti-vaccine parents tax time. True sunlight?

Because of*

Like, everyone forget, florida hot inside ac. Idk better conditions virus needs stupid/ignorant population. Lucky us former anything fix 😃  Wait vaccines 100%? get polio? (srs) Good leadership. Foxnews. 132k lockdowns. give basics math lesson starting exponents. ask many covid deaths we'd without lockdowns Argentina, many business owners already bankrupt. economic crisis we'll face pandemic unimaginable. calm down, worst shit over.

Hahahahaha hahaha may pass another multi-trillion-dollar stimulus prevent exactly that. 

The way know handle problems push next generation. Europe needed stimulus like that. US unique wasting money. Calling daily mail writes 'articles' far generous. Biology 101 textbook referring to? get author, edition, page number? I've working 25 years, can't find job now. Best luck. We're together righ tnow. vaccines messed people up? Jesus Christ, stupid person be... May got shows lack cautiousness probably led getting infected. offense friends behavior idiotic. smfh.  Based lagging behavior hospitalizations deaths, bit time see surge significant 1st wave. It’s premature say one thing other. got fat @ss kids here. r/byebyejob wearing masks they're going nominate Darwin Award. That's still natural selection. Powerseed version says 1g sugar, think that's probably healthiest option bread shelf local grocery store. exactly right. select group people told need go back work, children need group together schools, parents need go back work. absolutely right that. 

That exactly huge fucking problem it.  
It nasty fucking predicament sure. saying coming place literally fucking terrified children work love miss seeing beautiful (sometimes snot covered) faces, people work with, also work with, love miss seeing children.  
And even started talking children gave birth to.

Because even dealing pandemic, parents send kids school flu, turn pass us, take home families often. even phone calls made parents children spiked fevers, vomiting, coughing hard can't catch breath, can't get parents pick children school. know else schools have? Places effectively isolate children whose parents can't leave work come get them, instances, won't.  


You're right though, problem rich worry about. kids teachers going asked asked public school educators. kids make due space able made meet safety standards. me, children, children work will.  


Because broken ass system families rely public school system function daycare. know what, time works okay, right now, think okay. dealing typical circumstances. think entitlement someone think need unsafely return work people's children left home alone parent goes work. clicked twitter.. always forget horrible spambot cesspool platform is. conclusion masks effective reducing viral transmission. cited meta-analysis affirms masks effective reducing viral transmission. Seems fairly compatible me. Start petition build statue every year Texans commemorate absolute loser failure was.  2-3 years long time. I'm saying we're moving tomorrow definitely table move Christmas..
You know virus gonna around much longer 2-3 years. whole ""one half years till cure/vaccine"" BS, there's way anything. doesnt represent us sell Florida back Spain something? Yeah, duh, Fauci. know. fucking smart, resigned telling us obvious shit. world live in, smartest mother fucker find viruses, we're argue obvious points we're stupid engage higher-level talking points might, know, matter??? Boomer politicians sacrificing future country protect age class. Deaths 1k sure Friday trendline headed 7-day rolling average 1k maybe 2-3 weeks. Kn95 N95 equivalent. K means made China. Check death causes, increase. 

Mexico tried thing begining. Good points. bodies start drop wait minute...there TONS people- matter color worked ODDS get set hurt. COVID color blind far business shutdowns. Republican governments made laws prevent local government issues orders. that, shift blame cities state government run republicans. worst part deaths loved ones side passing away. That's wild, must kind financial aid bring class cost down? checked Virginia average cost $2k semester already pretty close b4  Yeah, though looks like 2 doses may need administered 28 days apart. That's complete misrepresentation covid is.doing affecting. minimum 1/3 get covid asymptomatic. pretending like either stay home half dead bed? 

Thx recognizing answers tho, weird so.much say. reality daycares open tho, whole.thing makes sense. guy bot advertises conspiracy theory subreddit don’t trust him. like forget Mobile phones google lol distant past. really living much 3 years. want chance getting injured knew afford deal potential medical expenses. country really needs get priorities straight. one person, though, much better hundreds. think would get mostly back normal. would like permanent flu season ""wash hands, keep distance, say home sick"" besides everyone back work. would take enough precautions keep hospitals overflowing still keeping many people working could. might tricky balance praying vaccine herd immunity something stop scenario becoming real one. fine, live like convinced don't. Lies . There’s way. America full idiots?!?    Unfortunately, many us not. Americans couldn’t give two shits rest world many us haven’t even traveled outside North America. Americans grown told older Americans best country evar still believe it. It’s evident health care debate. compare US’s healthcare much rest western world it’s pathetic bad US is. try telling brainwashed Fox News viewer. country might well collectively singing “It’s end world know it, feel fine” Edmontonian checking in. week -42. awful... union weak. strong enough union totally successful strike right work states. Idk trust giant meteor promise. Like would really giant meteor. want vote like Wyoming get wiped something. Fucking idiot cover everywhere difference network care network may significant terms pocket liability. think coming expert Iceland saying ""we found single instance child infecting parents."" found really surprising scroll way far see someone mention dandelion haha ""Thank staying Hammerhead Hotel"" Speaking someone two doctor parents still diagnosed underlying condition twenty, way knowing kid underlying condition right now. 

The safe thing act though do.  Confirmation biased means people can't see virus therefore believe real. read Facebook post today asking gyms opening. responses could summarized ""not many masks great job controlling capacity felt safe"" WTF???? gunman streets folks there's bit nuance I’m well aware supply demand. issue can’t build fast enough due high salaries tech employees allows artificial inflation. you’re 22 got job Amazon making 85k year paying $2500/mo 1 bedroom seem like much? No, don’t know better.

Honestly, tech bro make ~250k year idea starter home almost $1M problematic even us. vaccine developed super fast time table. trust going safe start corners cut. Yeah, existing vaccines super safe, that's spend years making sure one. could've easily said ""if living nice place, poor"", mean literally that's root argument. usually costs 10k move another country, nevermind effort involved. also takes months preparing. ""Simple decision"" ass. 

It's stupid, posted comment public forum, literally begging response. That's point forums. gave one.

I'm chill, bro. free ignore comments. NY plate returning FL? graduate next spring, I’ve already college 5 years point. I’m ready done. freshman I’d feel totally differently. freshman, aren’t going defer I’d suggest CC classes right now. big issue uni’s seen;t allowing freshies defer. either give acceptance apply another year stick out. Everything pretty much clusterfuck right now. wear mask written work allowed enter business. Im guessing casinos California last close. smoke, drink, restaurants open. Looks like going busy week asking people put mask told ""I cant breathe!"". Florida Arizona we're also least prepared states Union, even Covid. 

  

You'd think special attention would paid places particular, considering. boggles mind simply true. lol economy? worked hiv/aids NY hired metric buttons contact tracers. make like ticket quotas tracers, NYC’s got experience there. point I'm basically praying aliens exist show save us world we've created. Video cameras exist... Borders closed friend. try couple years though :) work place services ton older people several times throughout day get 70+ people telling plans go Florida. They're going specifically New York let anyone anything fun. seem think they'd rather die enjoying Florida cooped homes. they're dying there. seem connect dots they're traveling Hotspot, good time, getting sick coming back comfortable beds loved ones take care catch Covid them. Sometimes they'll even tell children begging go anyway. selfish attitude. Hide yo kids, hide yo wife... all-powerful.

Yes, Kryptonite coronavirus. get infected skin, besides, people wearing gloves would make things worse since would wash/sanitise hands less often. Trump maniac needs out.. man wish better option moron.. choice bad &amp; worse, like 2 long. Thanks link! notice that, even subtracting Covid deaths pneumonia deaths still incredibly elevated. hope get corona pay rest lives enhanced hearing include mind reading? Great tip thank you! -flair:USA doesnt seem work though shows US posts you’re understanding 2018, cumulative gifts father since Donald toddler amounts $413m 2018 dollars. That’s it. absolutely nothing rode inflation, 2018 would worth $413m (this simplified example).

Now, Trump’s purported net worth? google “How much Trump worth?” you’ll get $2.1 billion top browser, Trump bandied figures $10 billion range. truth matter he’s likely worth lot less says it’s actually closer $2-4b range.

But, let’s take Trump’s word say he’s worth $10b.

The problem instead diversifying holdings, net worth relies heavily upon real done well? Yes, though nearly well claims even though often buoyed father, even less, question whether Trump would successful plowing money market rather many failed businesses, question answered.

Furthermore, father’s family legacy inheritance already made difficult, impossible, completely fail. start game 3/4 around board already, you’re going really trouble getting end.

As “success president,” it’s McConnell Republican Party holding majority Senate (and beginning term, House well) successful *anything* President. It’s party’s complicity able avoid removed Presidency. basically bumbled way circumstances got presidency buoyed enablers.

In end, want talk understanding finance, guy you’re championing intelligent person clearly doesn’t understand all. Even financially illiterate least knows diversify, Trump clearly doesn’t do, it’s absolutely true Trump would worth lot actually is. I’m “DeVos idiot hired via pay play” camp, don’t see 14k number anywhere article. 

I’m also little drunk, though (sorry r/stopdrinking) dad died S.C. can’t go see can’t risk bringing COVID back home. So, maybe there? ""Although Stanford group’s estimation infection fatality rate falls low end range obtained antibody studies, outlier. meta-analysis Ioannidis found groups independently estimated similar fatality rates""

Except meta-study involves applying novel factor IFRs studies lower them, even fudge around included get acceptable result. sanity checks? article trying sell IFR .17% well New York New Jersey all-population mortality! Ya know... I'm you. Honestly biggest thing stopping much absolute pain dick get work permit countries lived in. Like unno maybe like everywhere, sucks thing fucked up. Wanting work leap ton loops able it.

&amp;#x200B;

Yes realize thing immigrants here, agree either. ya wanna work, let em work. question dodger. I'm Australian, yes.  Propaganda public healthcare real problem. rich put fear people lose rich give want profit people. already required masks indoors, adding outdoors. now, Oregon one lowest case/death counts country state trying hard restrict people to. 

Unfortunately, people idiots. past couple weeks, cases started explode contract tracing showing outbreaks coming private gatherings, make rules stricter. 

It sucks, really feel health authority really done solid job trying manage this. see tone daily emails getting desperate time goes on. working overtime trying keep us safe people going keggers. here. attended one Los Angeles. large crowd everyone making effort keep distance wear masks. would like think protesting didn’t contribute could not? timing numbers rising right would approximate incubation period wouldn’t it? Thank America! Without none would possible! 4% population contributing close quarter deaths! world forget contribution! make prison island anti maskers live mask free anxiety awful lately. I’ve contact doctor regards anxiety, can’t help it. live TN baby 2 months ago. constantly fear getting virus giving baby. 
I believe I’m relatively safe: constantly washing hands, isolate nail day, order groceries online pick always mask get them, wear mask whenever go house, take clothes shower went place high amount people. spend 99% day inside, back deck, small walk around neighborhood. scared virus infecting family. don’t want lose child, people inconsiderate uneducated. 

I fear may come TN well. peak? leveling out? Like what’s going happen?? Yup. I’ve back work couple weeks (customer service job) hope don’t get infected. live alone, unlike fellow coworkers. families jeopardy this. can’t show work. still bills pay. Americans forced play Russian Roulette daily leaders can’t admit wrong actually take steps necessary curb infections. Yeah, steps aren’t going pleasant. alternative going so, much worse. getting paid little graduate degree accounting? Even without CPA, I'd imagine making least double that, probably triple that. emphasis hips nail head regarding everything that's wrong administration resulting response virus. They're playing politics instead shutting navigating laws resources need get us worldwide disaster. 

The fact missed opportunity forefront navigating pandemic underlines country's poor leadership. hell goes florida summer? joins Norway study. show something different happens kids need information He’s perfect, damn love him. He’s got vote office runs for. call *Disney Death Nebulas*? Yup. wearing back people saying bad idea anti science wear one. leading experts saying pointless wear mask First page google searches disagrees. Literally look called nocebo effect.  Well there’s lot right now...

There also people flying essential work (like travel nurses), urgent medical care themselves. It’s people going Disney. wtf 'back April' mean? I'm afraid process far, far difficult here. American citizen likely get hired Canadian company without either special skillset, company sponsors you. 

Many us beginning put lot research immigration lol. guess get screwed either way. Two bad choices. used metaphor ""prophylactic"" effects based fast action prevention recurrence. metaphor works. considering efficacy, protects duration typical coronavirus vaccine. Don’t give assholes traffic, sub needs banned comment needs deleted. Perhaps Germany.

Here one known dead teacher another sick Coronavirus. I’m sure more. I'm wondering testing would higher year well, people concerned symptoms? Oh, *now* believes science wants scientists case? needs immediately apologize entire country he's handling mess Florida. florida, cant say im suprised. Daycares closed, too. feel like know this.

I idea do. telling feeding kids Styrofoam food, I'd tell thing I'm telling now: know solve problem, going make worse.

Kids go school going get sick, they're going get sick. Adults get sick COVID get sick month time, often more.

This choice missing work childcare missing work flat back bed month. There's option that's ""they go back school everything fine."" That's possible. Hate man guy America fucked. entitlement mentality second none. Please find local FQHC. sliding scale fees low $20 per visit house pharmacies. Also, please contact local hospital ask speak finance department grants people can't afford pay hospital fees. ER bill. often give 1 year discounts 70% 100%. Please seek care!! anything that's symptom covid-19? Problem while, really know. already know incorrect, yes, liable. lot information longer accurate.

There many strings attached anymore. IRS/SBA continuously made revisions make system lenient. majority used payroll, rest used rent/utilities/mortgage interest. relatively easy get fully forgiven. 8 weeks timeline also longer accurate, extended 24 weeks. could go nitty details, would take small essay numerous people already written.

That said - gist trying say correct. loan cover 8 weeks payroll many companies finding struggling continue paying employees loan proceeds ran out. loan forgiveness world matter still forced close doors.

Summary recent batch happen. Cambridge gives everyone BA, regardless undergraduate course, called Mathematical Tripos, three-year four-year course. graduate three years, receive BA degree. graduate four years, receive BA MMath average non American enjoying self inflicted nightmare America. 90% compliance enact measures longer. done. 

The thing is, even strict force 99% sacrificing morale economy. People could still go certain stores order things delivery less economic shut compared super strictly locking everyone absolutely essential workers. strict lockdown risk civil unrest. It’s finding balance. Massachusetts, Italy, even NYC shown types 90% compliant measures get numbers significantly. mistake going longer, poor reopening plans/messaging, convincing everyone wear frickin mask. Nope thing. feel way perhaps reflecting things going you. applaud pray remain healthy go work. Coronavirus disrupted family’s life family’s finances. still don’t think schools mass gathering activities need happening therapeutic/vaccine. Sorry getting defensive, feel like I'm attacked angles right now. I've dealing anxiety depression since kid 2 small kids I'm trying shelter this. family full Republican Trump ass kissers way conspiracy theorists life ever would imagined. feel like I'm losing mind. ship crafted bodies educators children. Lovely. Idaho governor chicken. union attempting save lives teachers led slaughter exceptions even high risk teachers, bad? I'd like see picture suits. 3 states accounting spike. Florida, California, Texas. Despite news portrays, I’d argue people taking seriously. live northeast one 3 spiking states literally right caseload began spike. tell taking almost equally serious state live in. exception bars night; literally zero regard safety there.

I worry going back school lot middle-of-the-country states seen significant case load. personally don’t think vaccine worthwhile though, want test subject rushed vaccine. I’m way anti-vaxxer, there’s reason typically take long approval require extensive testing. lol we’ll see world clamps Muslim Concentration camps. know can’t talk Winnie poe without getting thought police ass won’t even try lmao wrong, Asian people dont hesitate give beating, government. Ima haten guy Much like meeting reopen schools happening Zoom it’s dangerous meet in-person. irony staggering. mean, sounds like crashed hard losing.

And lost person.... mean holy shit. I've never done meth dude, would probably end sinking low. think chances getting day much mask = slim none. You’re better wearing one mask fits well comfortable enough don’t need remove constantly. goal become part outfit day, something eventually get used wearing. make much easier long run. 

I recommend try different cotton masks available Etsy. Get one filter pocket easily add protection needed. find shape/size fits face comfortably, buy enough week (1 per day.) Make sure straps adjustable... universal ear straps don’t give customized comfortable fit. heard estimates COVID goes unchecked US could kill 2.2 people That’s definitely approaching Spanish Flu levels. Go sit outside H‑E‑B you’ll see every color, age walk life wearing mask. I’d love blame republicans main culprits, still many dumbasses general wearing masks well...

let's, argument's sake, say view Palestinians historical unit (which exactly true, guys came Arab world, read autobiography Palestinian leader Ahmed Shukairy, saying many Palestinians regards Egyptians first ).

Arabs came 2 sources:

1. drifters, origin unknown.
2. main focus, Abraham's son, Ishmael.

Abraham 2 sons: Ishmael, left country Egypt, Izaak, stayed, fathered Jacob built roots country.

Jewish history's link people far Cousins, most. Dont fucking play politics card here. Senate acquitted Orangeness.

God sent plague.

Seems pretty clear. democracy need majority get done. think might responded wrong thread. We're discussing access social services need without pretending​ believe imaginary superheros. COVID hotspot CA, large Republican base screaming MUH FREEDUMB ignoring basic pandemic safety protocols packing bars, beaches etc. Everything political idiots, incapable personal growth. Now, kids suffer it. protests also outdoors, know far better preventing transmission hanging around indoors. percentage COVID-19 infected happen to? even statistically significant? Doubtful.  point looks like Dracula. gonna tell mfer doesn’t look like Dracula? Build wall! Keep us trapped! Can't run north, Canada dumbasses dumbasses there. burns blood see wilfull ignorance, shear cognitive brainwashing, no, retardation set place, causing disaster amplify. hate Florida much. uncontrolled Karen outbreak hope local hospitals slammed every year flu cases. Adding Covid cases already get would devastating. Massey guilty blasting car driving past certain locations making things worse. “respect rights! don’t respect yours!”

Sounds like conservative. Wow lines much shorter awesome!! seems like something food year cuz can’t taste thing.... knew dumb fucked America before, pandemic really showed depth it. insurance company likely refuse pay something like happens. ""did themselves"". Universities gonna reopen August. crazy? anecdotally friends California, compliance like 50% distancing without use force violation basic rights. impressive I’m guessing China could learn this.

Just anecdotally friends California, compliance like 50%. borne data Cali never got R0&lt;1 like NY. making worse closing.... going happen going plow through, going get worse worse hand forced prolong overall time needed beat virus, leaving wake cases, death, economic hardship. takes courage fortitude make hard decision close lockdown tight hit virus hard.... Abbott doest that, everyone Texas suffer it, one way another.  Yo that’s fucking bonkers insane man, don’t remember askin Eh, mean hasn’t taken another lockdown table. said news interview spread didn’t slow, option would another lockdown. fan Abbott, he’s miles better DeSantis  unfortunate feeling tip stupid iceberg It’s weird many non elected people think ability make decisions country operate don’t grasp acting like tyrannical oppressive government would act  Lol wishful thinking Yeah, I’m CA could end going either way. Either this’ll best possible place live country, ground zero sort fallout-mageddon.

I feel like Alaska could get annexed Canada pretty easily, maybe I’ll move there. Yea selfish bastards... straight ignorant. see cleaning fish desk. Well, shit. someone told earlier reopen try curb thing got worse... case you’re serious, weekends + mondays lowest case count death counts. Anyone who's ever checked MOOCs surprised this. Even best students takes whole lot discipline stay engaged online schooling. Yeaaaa... need bunker. Yeah, instead they're like, ""here's webinar estate planning. Please draft pre-emptive notice parents case death."" Well, people died flu human history died Covid 2020. esoteric way that's technically correct.  Thanks, shitshow living finest. 

That makes sense, number-wise. think looking vomit literally coming mouth, whatever would answer someone saying straight face, “So, 14,000 children dying okay you?” what? covid tests free america?
damn, goes homeless LA SF... Good 'ole Washington Post.  Poster child 21st Century version yellow journalism. Mask-free relaxation zones.... relaxing sleep like dead! foolish president. COVID virus shrouded protein. Protein, meat. keep meat cool preserve, heat denature. makes sense air conditioned buildings preserve virus effectively increase lifespan. day, kids didn’t die dysentery walked uphill ways school ate one avocado week. They’d scrape brown film day eat spread hard tack. Made soup seed peel. two years. We'll see COVID death count end this. place packed whenever drove last weeks, surprised. DeSantis, Also July 2020: Schools fine. Kids spread virus. misinterpretation news site, even Russian one. 1st phase trials finished, entire trials. island mandate masks, enforce it, may enough stop spread locally. Tourists different issue; islands become covid-free bunch idiots may flock there, cheer need wear masks, proceed infect everyone. one fast moving RNA virus, likely evolve quickly.

With much damage does, don’t think kill venerable fast? think going go away true. Humans eradicated one virus ever.

In US, allow ton immigrants everywhere. People 3rd world, can’t control virus anyway would love come work.

The capital already place support population.

As awful sounds, likely keep importing people replace losses.

I’ll likely one losses, gotta hella sick got COVID. Give 10 rounds next decade I’m done. probably performed multiple human challenge studies poor ""volunteers "" injected vaccine. know would sure otherwise. little empathy, goes long way. go teach? Seriously...you seem figured out.

I hold breath. 

You're fucking jackass. Historians tell story. Hell, journalists already pointed high number excess deaths. ignoring fact going back now, without proper distancing sanitization measures place (the majority US schools way equipped this), cases spiking, result closures! open schools now, they'll closed within month we're back crisis mode, slapping together online learning emergency plans. Instead, making comprehensive plans distance learning, organizing strategies get kids access internet, technology, meals, counseling. plan short-sighted political play devastating impacts health school staff families, families children attending schools, children.

I understand without childcare also devastating lot families, we're going end either way. smart thing would without overwhelming hospitals losing lives.  mask moron, wear freedoms stake here! founding fathers would *totally* behind rebel bad governors form coalitions like last time shut thing president imposes. Even order, police enforce weaken protests. many companies aren't... Post peak times politics might -750 this. 

I bet protests significantly impacted things. images many people packed nyc Austin Portland either inspiring horrifying depending what’s top mind. 

To say didn’t anything “outside” “most people masks” doesn’t change often walking air repeatedly huge marches, screaming, shoulder shoulder, etc.  

Maybe didn’t “hurt” places decline like nyc much defiantly skyrocketed transmission up. 

What think likely odd person wandering around CVS eating restaurant 100,000 ppl screaming shoulder shoulder lol need hear retired game show hosts make final decision... I'm saying COVID-19 death toll much higher State Florida letting on. (DeSantis) want numbers look good possible unless know sure somebody died COVID-19 count official numbers. Kudos copy-pasting. I’m much better analysis tho.  America opening schools 70,000 cases day. actual fuck wrong brains. average IQ must 40. projection intelligence consider factor infection Karens Orange County zero fucking idea science works. Anything inconveniences even slightest slight them.

You already Los Angeles San Diego committing online-only course fall. Except Taiwan free country. Go back r/sino propaganda spread lies Whaaaaaaaaat?  I'm shocked. Shocked tell you. They'll flatten curve next labs report 100 percent positivity, means every single person tested positive. saw cuban news, everyone claiming vaccine, someone gets vaccinated wont believe it. wife baby due November, seriously looking way Canada child might fucking future. mean Italy, Spain, Belgium ahead per capita deaths, US still top ten. Also cases increasing US, unlike countries. America number 1?

Some states seem handling better others least. Good luck. Rumor Disneyworld opened cause children dead parents better identify story line Disney movies. Beautifully said  I’m not, cases started spiking 5-6 weeks ago time mostly accounted for...but also, compare caseload death toll two links date. Even accounting lag, we’re still seeing heavy decline deaths. Thankyou!

This last reply it’s time gloat. you’re scared give estimate I’ll assume believe it’s 1% mortality 60% prevalence needed immunity. So, end year we’re close 1.9 million deaths hope learn stay things you’ve knowing about. You’re expert reading articles medical school you’ve misinterpreted put much faith into.

Florida confused late start moral superiority political genius, worked overtime suppress data undercount numbers. Oops. looking state state, yes possible second wave weeks/months reopenings people start relax go back normal behaviors. lot depend decisions schools universities make, places large gatherings churches. people congregate numbers rise, that's virus works. state decide deal that. guaranteed continue hell lot better many U.S. states. brought town hall, saying seeing numbers yet weeks. reassuring news all. crazy amount kids. maybe five minutes groups, lesson plan intervention groups supposed 3 4 kids.

Home rooms crazy amounts 36 kids one class. messed up. think they're individual governors deploy mean ""office sitters"" insult. job job everybody stay afloat hopefully climb ladder.

And that's exactly issue we're having, governor procrastinating summer, wants rack taxes call lockdown season many die then? governor make priority save economic ""bounties"" people's lives, right approach.

Don't worry - getting hate people charge day.
But know - tell jump bridge, would jump bridge? That's feel, nobody told jump bridge, they're jumping it. They're dumbasses.
I understand dreamed vacation year even longer want miss god damn. gonna kill people coming - people common sense, government put ordnance place shit goes whatever.

Very likely professional athletes top list leagues team owners want something else- bring crowds back. They're losing shit ton money. guy posted Twitter.

 must mean finger guns points virus yell, ""Pewpewpew"" 🤣They afraid call pandemic day 1. idiots. Cornell bad comparison. Cornell large endowment averages $42K financial aid. Try Bennington College. current rates.... likely all.  last month, we've averaging 5k week.  We've got bit 2 weeks left month, trend continues, may add another 10-15k, brings us 150k.  Granted, alarming increase cases... trend could change.  pretty steady even rapidly rising cases.... far.  

In mid April worst two weeks far deaths go, getting around 16.5k per week.  last month, even cases pretty rapidly climbing, death toll staying fairly steady 4k 6k.  

I'm downplaying anything - clearly serious situation.  Even 5k week, that's around 260k dead year.  That's vastly worse murder rate (around 18k year, memory serves).  That's vastly worse auto-deaths (around 30-40k memory serves).  Even amount people we've lost (close 136k) amazing people make light situation.  insane.  able mobilize essentially 20 years war 9/11, cost less 4000 lives.  struggle convince decent chunk population wear masks.

And that's including non-death problems covid causing (long term damage, etc). Well... Fauci captain obvious. Counterpoint without school, number kids go hungry, number kids fall behind academically, number kids could miss socialization skills time lives learn skills.

Now, I'm saying wrong--you're certainly not. I'm saying simple school everything's fine. real problems sending kids school. New York nursing home employee tell you, doesn’t happy ending. reason kill right now? March told everything going better summer I'm told next year. rate, things never will. I've already mental health destroyed everything I've looked forward happen. try get help they'll involuntarily hospitalize me. point I'd rather get virus die. Lmao likely seen real start yet. Stop sugarcoating stuff. True, believe that. Ive seen though. Theres alot misinformation. I'm sure dont know whole truth. Certain diseases known direct cause ""Cytokine Storm"" over-response immune system ends damage body. short circuits immune system, even never immune system deficiencies. make sound like immune system cases naturally overactive, case. Ill bite baiter.

In way? dont get one cares local businesses. imagine putting life saving cafe seeing lose completely control. know people personally happen day empathy guys. pretend heroes care people dont. enjoy watching businesses go under. remember 5 years every business Applebees money local businesses  dilemma, agree. water pretty muddy. Expert opinions constantly refined information study comes light. research paper linked perfect case point. study might great merit, yet author admits model subject range variables can't accurately predict, 43% optimistic projection. grounded science, yet subjected normal process scientific rigor either move dial consensus not, depending whether study valid, repeatable holds scrutiny. hand, opinion referenced 6 weeks old. Maybe that's totally date given pace experts getting grips this. Either way rhe threshold effective herd immunity, 40% 60% still feels long way me. 

I guess learn trust scientific process, put obstacles path best placed work. literally living petri dish right now,. people’s inability comprehend impact virus much everyone seems value drink public health. Definitely people wearing masks Boulder country. bet it’s close 9 10 people anywhere go. Boston 1 5 kids disappeared completely.

If go back Fall gone forever. Let's see... 7 folks still follow lol. piece discusses possibilities two infections two separate strains. like trump. Suprising it,  yet wife pediatrician treats children. says fully half parents lack basic information concerning COVID-19 virus (it's effects humans spread) full army evangelicals thinking praying 24/7 direct evidence airborne study China investigated outbreak started Buddhist temple event, tracing much spread confines one buses transporting people function. bus one sick person aboard, 24 67 people bus got sick, possibly indicating airborne transmission. sat windows fared better, indicating importance ventilation.

But studies show closer infected people others, infections spread. Somehow turned Us vs controversy, like timeless Good vs Evil plot fiction. 

I'm going go ""The people may infected, safer be"". bet people will, group, less likely get infected. wtf know, still think ""airborne"" means something travels air currents. Thought said “mask wearers” second almost lost even hope “the rules force right thing” === Bible hes right know.  offered online schooling school district central California (San Joaquin county). gave 2 options: 

1. Online 

2. Regular class social distancing, staggered classes, reduction students per class. would make kids wear masks provide hand sanitizer..... kid staying home. Brian Kemp says no. That’s essentially means **if** already immune system disorder, hence increased risk complications covid-19. Maybe Ted actively malicious this, there's still broader point think regarding coffee/tea. Depending coffee temperature drink size, takes like half hour get cup coffee. stuff hot chug (and hell chugs coffee anyway?). That's half hour where, regardless intention, unmasked, crowded area. opposed cup water juice coke drink minute.

Yeah Florida reporting real numbers would probably 60-80+k now. Imagine silent deaths 4 weeks now. One things trusts, especially private college trusts, allowed dip certain percentage principle crisis. C’mon - USA never done start first wave everyone knows this. I'd shut down. kid wear mask ! can't Gerrymander statewide at-large post. really way. consequences, types people give shit. stores implement $500 ""no-face cover charge"" someone wants enter without mask. Place big bouncers outside collect cash keep out. Stores freedom too, freedom serve someone putting others risk. want special privileges, gotta pay. 

In many places, things enforced. sign enough, gotta beef security like nightclub would. Maybe people would less willing freakout huge bouncer, instead teenage cashier. Maybe ""no face cover charge"" would cause people pause 1 second say, hey actually big deal put one on. 

May sound drastic, many people proven idiots this. affecting everyone else causing things get worse. USA shut whole prob would laid job last week....... even looks like finger guns... Singapore ""talk shit get hit"" society Rona Deathsantis last point - yes exploring options relocation everyone half brain should. want part mad scientists' experiment.

Oh my, yeah no, meant walk across street see group individuals masks. mean relocate, I? 

If mired 2-3 years, may use passport ride there. Luckily field still demand, however, hiring still (Canada). 

Good luck, hopefully things pick conservation! never heard Florida again. someone sent lovely misinformation video assured virus can't survive hot temperatures herd immunity going work super well, good, realllllly soon.  111 AZ today, maybe gets hotter people stay inside AC. believe worldometer includes unconfirmed possible deaths. I’ll double check example racially homogenous society (i know diversity LDS majority). people care intrest neighbor, easier get traction initiative group betterment. bad US couldnt even roll mask mandate even motivated personal intrest... sick sad world! know people travel often right? risk them. spreading cities due travel internationally cross country. Stay locale til over. seriously see many fucking RVs come rural town stop hem haw. Worse, kids won’t schooling fall. 
So virtual schooling hurt poor all, widening gap rich poor. 

If care poor kids, want person schooling. Forcing people buy shit like car insurance Obamacare mandate wrong I'll decide want wear mask man going Harvard law doesn’t mean makes stupid statements attempt hide truth. doctorate well capable making stupid statements even I’m trying lie. Go onto Salon.com's website type Dr. John Gartner's comments Donald Trump. Downright scary. might trying look good accepting huge amount money China. hand war really happens, Victoria never need pay China back, makes free money.

It's bit sneaky, not? water wet Yeah, let's upbeat, positive attitude deadly, permenantly debilitating pandemic change things wearing mask What? read that? you’ve never faced challenge life told something oppression. way toddler cries kicks told man-children doing. dangerous culture mentally stunted children who, various reasons, never developed emotional maturity four year olds. 

Their response ever crying lying throwing tantrum. like every toddler told no, simply experience react stable adult would. woman utter disaster country. inept, inarticulate, short-sighted greedy. 

Good thing President exact oppossum! ^^of_course_/s watched whole thing. Devos one point, kids school. reporter agreed WANT that, one safely? Devos answer that, answer that. That's TL;DR interview. trolls bombarding subreddit ""help understand something, deaths down?"" weeks, launching maskhole/anti-lockdown/antiscience garbage. They're still forms little harder deaths objectively down.  Thanks clarifying, it’s hard keep bull shit straight. virus mutating. newer strain worse former. info people need know. 

this centuries Spanish Flu possibly. first strain kill many people think went three strains Second Third killed Million USA 30-40 million world wide. much collective deaths WWII Europe.  

this sucks perverse sense he's right: stabilizing exponential growth pattern.  much longer til herd immunity  Heard Gillette making 5 layer mask sit close feel like part face.

I actually saw masks sale walmart today Hanes I'm sure far off.   Norte Dame.

Norte Dame bad example means ""Northern Lady"" college university. Try Notre Dame. What’s infuriating every human knows cold/flu infectious matter feel kinda ok horrible. mom taught 5, wash hands cover mouth cough sneeze know droplets spread it. mask might 40-95% effective, cares, it’s blocking stuff. Imagine superpower radioactive spit, you’d wear fucking mask. think word looking indefinite Appreciate it! Americans believe centre world. care what's happening countries? places virus stopped effective shutdowns masks. idiots America brazil causing massive outbreaks. ""Boyfriend gets tested 22nd""?????? wait time get tested? so, sign up? stop belief “old normal never come back?” world went back normal spanish flu killed millions lethal. virus kills mostly old people immunocompromised people wont change world forever. get vaccine, start rebuilding going back normal. don’t get vaccine, suck live virus. one going social distancing, wearing masks, closing businesses forever. voted guy wanted M4A work theory, yes. looking milder flu season normal. However, know hospitals strained flu season. mild flu plus corona may mean overwhelmed hospitals 3 generations anti-science. understand could call pedo Biden call trump same. I'm even defend Biden, fact trump *verifiably* done worse, makes statement opinion invalid me. 

Your ignorance perfect example America. Every day since came out! guess means every restaurant CA must switch indoor outdoor service shut down. able convert experience figured out. many workers unemployment back it. vaccine progress looks really good. guess it’s possible could looking rollout starting 2021, could likely we’ll see first doses vaccine (probably Oxford) year. You’ll see impact first batch vaccines available, too, soon way.

And ridiculous number vaccines development. something goes wrong Oxford vaccine, there’s still lot candidates could well need. Ah, yes. Thanks reminder. 

Sincerely, 

hypochondriacs 

😂😩 effin moron. Yep... 40% reduction R-zero massive impact spread virus. I.e. R0 1.5 (bad) become 0.9 (reasonably good)... R0 1.1 (okay enough) becomes \~0.65 (almost great). realize things listed Feds pay for, won’t needed schools go virtual. Kinda ironic. fear not, Disney coming rescue... people running cash registers ones ultimately enforce rule. 

Sure would nice say 'you gotta mask everywhere state' instead reality live masks laws might differ street corner street corner. car insurance would unconstitutional.

The conclusion study cited used healthcare workers. reasons gave penetration reuse moisture retention, significant issue wearing 10-12 hour shifts multiple patients. wearing 10 minutes check gas station moisture retention going contribute like that.

They also variables controlled like often masks washed group using surgical n95 masks reused patients. poorly done study control list possible variables.  always ""what about"". swear conservatives know hypocrisy deflection, God forbid ever actually defend Trump without invoking context bullshit.

**So Florida repeatedly shoot face next elections.** wanted normal economy, needed take virus much seriously jump. COVID economy really begins.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree state representative Alabama. heard anyone say way forward build herd immunity. find quote state representative Alabama? Maybe google search.

This predominant party line -- vaccine around never heard herd immunity thing without vaccine. article describes two ways herd immunity pretend expert. detected BS. Back March, saying wear masks, spare N95 mailed 94 year old mother. 

Now detecting BS vaccine. pandemics centuries past end? possible virus mutated less lethal, possible herd immunity reached. certain vaccine developed ended pandemics reaching back pandemic ended Athens self-rule.

What saying can't say vaccine end pandemic. think vaccine get time make much difference. r/bodyweightfitness 


Maybe get TRX bands, since switching home workouts even pandemic doubt I'll ever go back gym. much time efficient workout home, used take 45 minutes get ready, drive gym, park, drive home.... pop bed amount time takes get gym I've already completed full HIIT workout. end working lot since convenient. context, today Florida 12,600 cases.

Last Monday, state reported 6,300 cases. overly optimistic. pointed yourself, free movement across states.

Apparently completely, believe Maine requiring visitors Massachusetts quarantine. strict know, would guess we'll see think happen panic sets people infected states finally realise they're against?

Are people panicking Arizona? NYC explode? I've seen people upset depressed things, seen actual unrest. anything people infected areas minimizing risk.  Complicit? LOL. Ooookay. 

Try comparing reponse DeSantis Abbott, things like FORBID individual cities counties protecting residents. No, Gavin left Tahoe Tahoe wanted, Tahoe said ""fuck residents let die COME WE'RE OPEN.""

Newsom watched guys fuck up, local gov't failed respond growing case numbers, stepped forced close back down. blaming him? 

Daddy gave local leadership phone, used run crazy high candy crush bill. So, daddy taken away phones act like adults.

Don't blame Newsom giving chance fucked up. Blame yourselves. leap frog local leadership blame guy literally closing guys back wishes local gov't hold water logically. Yep. choose sex. protected sex. 

Breathing isn’t choice idiotic irresponsible dumb shits spreading around complete nightmare. Good you! informed school district yet? wonder school districts starting see uptick people pulling out. Stay safe! Hmmm get lot vitamin naturally Australia, even winter sun strong. wonder what, any, effect us. Interesting! Hell yes, people weren’t dying would heaven. Yes. Beware 0.65% mortality rate among general population. Wear mask certainly die. worse could kill Culmo's grandma! Please supply evidence ""definitely, absolutely cases covid NZ"" 

I say ""under border control"". said cases - wrong, spreading misinformation. said were, know, that's correct. [Here's proof currently 25 active cases.

At border... they're hotels Auckland. Auckland definitely New Zealand! NZ's populated city, probably contains dense urban areas. Current breaches quarantine protocol getting lot press include people absconding quarantine hotels city tracked returned. People ""speak truth"" without evidence

You're pulling ass. Stop spreading misinformation. There's enough misinformation there.

You desperate confused person. one people lecture New Zealanders damn home thousands miles away. can't post without full wrong!

I've wasted enough time you. go “Everything’s fine” “FEMA, please help”? Yeah, going really hurt. Going lockdown starting point functioning economy easier would now, we're already reeling last try. people closer edge last time, there's less confidence government knows doing. 

It's like trying dive grab something bottom pool, best first time, give soon, try again, winded time catch breath, well...each dive gets progressively less likely succeed fail altogether. That's great news. flirting USA worst country numbers ~40,000, seem quickly separated. unmitigated disaster since day 1  ever loving fuck doing?

The rest 1st world largely this- least learning cope it. US denial. actually good president cracked dumbasses zero mercy would gotten line. president crazy, crazy national emergency powers sort situation could done pretty extreme shit little friction branches. worry lot less one starts fight people wearing masks doubt. Sometimes need get chest. sometimes gotta get story feel like alone this. anything, hope least story inspires someone else right thing. good person. world needs people like you.  MAH RIGHT MERICUN!

Seems like bit hiring now, still brutal there. friends took 1-2 years land job. going wasteland. Lately, I've thinking demonstrations like exemplify happens people likely struggled little experience control. think see headlines like entitled Californians throwing tantrums grocery stores like- think people never experienced like exposed something larger yourself, something unfeeling uncaring nonetheless predatory, able damn thing it. think friends color, family white passing- think times sitting cars police officers stop us nothing, inspect cars good reason, subject us fear subjugation simply can. think who've failed system, judged glance, know life treat unfair hand matter special think never, ever exempt undue misfortune- see shit like Florida think: people risking lives acting insane never, ever known like victim. think they're entitled, think they're *invincible*. Yes, help people. businesses goners. US lose entire role world likely collapse. Economics keeps countries going. Find one first world country economy Kids used play outside day eat healthy food. eat junk food play day online. cause concern even without virus math trust scientists CDC done me. tens thousands unreported cases currently total number cases. definetely relying worldometers raw data source. That's going lot revenue hospitals I'm sure who's quote is....""At point intelligence test"" aren’t many things true gotta way you!  Every person saw couple protests dropped wearing mask... every single person. 

Except half police. Gyms included counties “watch list”. counties cover 80% California’s population. think amazing opportunities exciting developments cheaper rent! commercial rent gonna high anymore! rememver while.back berated thrrad fot laughing ppl went college jts scam. Still think not? completely misunderstood me. wasn’t talking covid testing all. Alot testing plus community spreads several weddings according health department. Sugar milk IIRC american bread (like really whitest white breads) staples

of course starters quick easy ones NEED SUGAR dont wait hours end mother (doner starter) mature

if rye sourdough another different thing tellin' like is. yeah pretty spooky family’s phones went time stats listed us average. 

That’s shabby basically line said it.

I didn’t say great exemplary lol. think whole thing pretty fucking evil, taken enhanced health safety measures--for you, guests, Cast Members. must follow posted instructions visiting Walt Disney World inherent risk exposure COVID-19 exists public place people present. COVID-19 extremely contagious disease lead severe illness death. According Centers Disease Control Prevention, senior citzens guests underlying medical conditions especially visiting Walt Disney World Resort, voluntarily assume risks related exposure keep healthy."" Sun’s guns out? you… sarcastic? U.S. alone, nearly 20% population affected. average, 25 50 million documented influenza cases, 225,000 hospitalizations, ultimately 20,000 deaths occur every year.1,2,4–7”

The article link claims CDC “admits fudging numbers” fails provide source claim, instead citing single “small town physician” explains death certificates drawn extrapolates numbers deaths related COVID can’t trusted. 

Are claiming don’t trust medical community large put forth best estimations cause death? Finally someone speaking TRUTH! based aTm

I took mean ""At Moment""

could wrong tho gotta say, I’m Walmart 95% people wearing masks wearing correctly. kudos Walmart patrons.

Everyone else social media doesn’t give single fuck though  Yep. reason exist think restaurants significantly reduced capacity, gives people place socially distance snack sitting down. Bread, white blue That's typical citizen pays taxes. public fucking servants. could wear mask. ask read this? reasoning behind recommendation is? That’s low oxygen levels talking. oxygen levels normal, you’d know masks losers. Team America Fuck ya! Interesting. noted article discusses theory single gene toll-like receptor 7 protein escapes chromosome silencing. isn’t comment suggesting females get double immune system, it’s small piece viral inflammatory response. notable differences immune function related estrogen (see mice study referenced) lower rates cardiovascular disease/hypertension. Sooooo people able drive around 5,000lbs killing machine without liability coverage? know supreme court ruled constitutional correct? 

Ok billybadass. Incorrect within first five words, record pace.

People haven’t staying home, haven’t wearing masks level needed be. Massive protests didn’t help either everyone think crazy, probably thought warned, end January, prep couple months supply food hand, prepare quarantine two months. studied foods highest lowest death rate countries. ones found could make huge difference death rate drink 6 12 ounces beer day. eat legumes like kidney beans. Drink one two cups least 2 percent milk day. correlated really reducing death rate. Maybe much 20 times. look difference Germany Italy. basically described Germany diet you. Germans old Italians, death rate Italy always high, even caseload skyrocketed. - grandpa

🤣🍺🍺🥛 know, shocked too!!! signed online days ago. floored thought encouraging everyone get tested thought lots testing locations tons appointment dates. know rolled back testing labs overwhelmed, places back testing people symptoms. still. long time. 

So, basically, time made appointment test, could spreading around...and time gets tested, could test negative time, body fought infection asymptomatically. Soooo negative test result, could mean shit him. planning get tested tested positive, I'm unsure time gets tested, could passed body given me. Look, least they’re ordering masks worn, matter excuse. Better countries done - including own. well trump video new many times sniffing touching kids.. Trump alot thing people said MIGHT done.. damn news front everyone.. Bidens creep.. last years.. trump didnt ever. whole thing experiment. right, every study limited scope, control group due ethical reasons, plagued lot problems. Even experts supposed follow disagree. listen American experts, whose strategy proven either successful implementable American society, listen experts successful countries, like Denmark put kids back school height pandemic caution using masks community settings clinical protocol practical, well.

With herd immunity, look Sweden seeing one steepest drops new cases anywhere, reporting 20 percent people Stockholm testing positive antibodies month ago, look New York’s curve, totally different strategy, similar slope curve, also reaching 20 percent NYC around time Stockholm did, gotta wonder: coincidence? effect herd immunity really begin show effect levels? kind idiots exist europe spain got foned parties following rules California approaching 1% population infected. Fucking shit. ADE always concern, common far I'd say there's nothing data suggests going here, least frequency. were, we'd seeing re-infections (if indeed we've seen any, doubtful), probably rising case fatality rate, re-emergence serious disease death places like Italy, NYC, Boston. Well start coming town it. Bunch maskless Floridians roaming around. Gtfo He's right. Fuck wear one. need mandatory every state fuck talking about? P.S. Earlier post yesterday showed 140k antibody tests taken since June 15th, 17.6% positive ratio. true. really wanted save economy, would locked hard start. would short effective. state obvious. seems us government ill intent. enjoy it, also spend hour grocery store public anymore. public, fast mask on. 

If protects even 5% extra COVID, I'll take precaution. charge exorbitant amounts money expect government offer students loans pay it, young people don’t choice, since college degree modern equivalent high school diploma.

Fuck them. numbers always dramatically lower Monday. Okay, I’m stupid then. scared. I’m rejoining world.

Are scared virus? suggest stay home longer worried. keep saying it. Never, EVER think you’ve heard stupidest news coming Florida outdo stupid effing selves every. single. day.  Dough conditioners, sugar high fructose corn syrup, tons preservatives, random chemicals us don’t know are. Good. Send room start behaving. allowed come play. EU got higher restictions regarding data tracking privacy policy US. Thats sites working Europe glad it. Fuckers save everything you. actually makes sense regards typical vaccine phases.

This Trump trying inject good (but fake) news stock markets. That’s generous. I’m fond calling killers. Wow sounds like dodged asshole-shaped bullet realllllly believe CDC says? say Trump wants. way attribute deaths covid indeed skewed. AZ maintained 90% capacity shipping people state, state, discharging anyone need immediate critical care. Time ramp antagonism towards threats public health. yup. Took til 26 (2013) actually get career, thankfully I've avoided layoffs far. wife finally got career 5 years ago now, future really uncertain working school district already facing possibility needing downsize. we'll see happens next months. 

Thankfully we've really lucky ones, bunch friends lucky. Shit sucks yo. Gotta keep good work, hope 0 Well, also consider IQ test determines it. Lots people would argue shows kids getting worse specific tests administered, could number reasons besides declining intelligence. seen actual unrest.

That's pretty much kind thinking Florida numbers went sky. numbers low, safe open wide. seen actual unrest (so far), happen (in future). See similarity?

I see also ignored Wuhan counter-example gave. it. know weeks time. Conservative Orange County Liberal California Liberal Austin Conservative Texas.   clarify, PCR tests ongoing infection also available free Stockholm region, regardless symptoms. sign appointment antibody tests symptom free, healthy least two weeks since period thought sick. **Affiliation:** California Baptist University, Public Health Department

**Study Title:** COVID-19 Questionnaire

**Study Description:** Everyone 18+ welcome take survey. survey focuses response COVID pandemic public knowledge regarding disease. survey take 10 minutes average complete.

**Study Link:** (ethical/legal):** study approved university's IRB (078-1920-EXP)

**End Date:** Open  I'm sure will. People say college experience, end day, people paying diploma. Students bind options suck-it-up pay prolong graduation date. would say current prediction optimistically. already 138,000 deaths. recent days (not counting weekends) number daily deaths already close 1,000, clear upward trend. would next 17 days day 1k dead people, would already 155,000. think towards end months deaths increase sharply. 50k+ daily cases started beginning July, people recently died got infected overall number infected still significant lower. better chance re-flattening Earth point. 

The longer goes on, conspiracy lunacy abounds. mean...our president quoted Chuck Woolery, noted epidemiologist, today. Yeah flit ""IT'S CHOICE"" bullying mask-wearers. Bad people. Well choke breath. historically considered bad thing. *40 business important enough sacrifice people? Get fucked. months ago people thought India would bad we're aware densely populated surprising horrible. Now, numbers actually going it'll lot harder contain. hospitalizations also need nearly high US death rate go start going dramatically. Ah. He’s trolling. Wife works private high school. enrollment actually least early, slightly ahead projection. $50k usd per year 9-12th grade... think richer folks expecting kids get higher standard learning, via private idk. affluent area though, don’t know they’re overall. I'm sure saying. suggesting able wanted?

Or, saying worth pay full tuition get degree chosen University? Show's us much know everyone knows Doom Gloom 

Doom always proceeds Gloom Governor DeathSentence build wall, I’m sure could swing bucks dig trench one bigly boats sail right Houston! literally lying every word saying. Poorer households immediately provided free high speed access device child. Everyone thinks kids immune. context.

Approximately 11M kids USA got FLU 2018 500 died. guarantee 11M kids get COVID USA, we'll lot 500 deaths. 

Closing schools prudent decision much spread. Montana Connecticut, consider opening schools. hot spot states, need closed. Ever see Mickey South Park? sure does.  Last time checked, Forever 21 indoor store... even outdoor mall, closed.  Look today’s graph. see order went out...NASDAQ NYSE closed down, DJIA didn’t dip open closing, ten. write ""Our Cartoon President?"" Contact Colbert see he's hiring. 

Actually, scratch that. another season. See personally breathing problems mask seem inhibit breathing

SO go outside all, obviously nut suck go out, idea people dumb

Guess GOTTA go Disney World Voting do. Cheers man. Article even address question. anecdote quotes doctors. exactly experts lol. would reputable institute like CDC saying completely different number? guess smart think that. bad enough idiots wear masks themselves, harrass wearing mask unconscionable.

I’m getting impression don’t genuine interest answering query rather wanted reaffirm opinion masks somehow pointless hoping nobody could provide evidence effectiveness. presented evidence directly contradicts opinion, somehow deny validity (wrongly) pointing flaws scientific methodology. Masks effective. Get wear one. Stop anti-masker. It’s minor inconvenience could save someone’s life. Surely god that’s worth effort. 

And regarding link retraction study, Lancet withdrew article authors said article couldn’t confident data. appropriate thing Lancet it’s hardly discredit them.

It’s silly treat free movement states sacrosanct right, movement obviously deadly pandemic it’s enumerated constitutional right. However, ship sailed. virus control Northeast everywhere else hotspot.

However, locking state borders would one piece puzzle. time New York shutdown, already documented cases 50 states. Without widespread mask-wearing, social distancing, partial shutdowns, would wound matter what. I'm 20, I'm terrified this. Thank saying this. developed permanent disability past virus.

Perhaps something positive arise take long long time. Well, personal opinion stay put. current situation FL California, closing beaches, opinion counts anything.
I think going beach problem itself, outdoor infections especially spaced seem drive infections. However, reality beach crowded, people gathering meeting friends, people going restaurants bars afterwards, use bathroom, etc. That's probably driving infections see opened beaches. lack death... far. Also, Florida's death toll twice they've reported according guy you. Poor people die quicker, knew? Shasta County, CA Theres good reason that.

I live Hillsborough county, FL. It’s major county, housing city Tampa. result, we’ve nearly 20,000 cases here. mask ordinance city Tampa went effect 6/19, rest Hillsborough county days later. county seeing decrease ED visits percent positive tests. wait time test decreased two weeks ten days. head USF Health’s nursing department msnbc Friday saying good signs, we’ll need another 2-3 weeks know sure trend continue. 

Before mask ordinance, mask usage town less 50% stores. Sometimes one wearing mask. Now, rarely see people without masks. yes, need told specifically wear mask. 

Throughout this, DeSatan nearly useless. We’ve gotten actions local leadership. never happen. Take Tampa Bay Area example. several counties make Bay Area. need coordinate plans might well bother. need governor act. much local leadership does, restrictions state level would make things much clearer.

Not bad, far 99.9% I'd estimate least 300k election drastic changes made. increasing exponentially, there's actions play slow this. Well wear mask looting attacking cars god, innocent 5 months ago. Imagine scared flight attendant would telling Ted Cruz wear mask. US Senator lucky even working, furloughs travel industry. anyone filmed interaction put online, _you_ would one receiving death threats. Cruz go extended periods time (or full length travel) without mask on, it’s huge shame AA’s statement reviewing details merely reached ‘affirm importance policy’ senator. 

There actual consequences regardless status. FFS, we’re pandemic serious prioritizing communal health. 

That said, think it’s fair include [this photo Cruz wearing mask

Thank  Old news. wish people didnt get easy karma stuff. Clearly, explains unlikable.

Have good day guy Welcome land Me!!!! like flat Earthers? grew Springs haven’t decade, that’s official estimate too. Teachers going need strike keep forced dangerous situations. even worse knowing dying alone center lockdown. people follow benefit cronies corporate intrests. 99% us population gets benefit administration. administration provided $1,200 stimulus check tax dollars. stimulus bill passed included $33,000 per USA house hold tax dollars corporate bailout. reasonable conjecture early days, enough data go off. Certainly nearly worst outbreaks cold, time, started northern hemisphere's winter kind expected. Dr. Truth forsooth. 106 F / 41.1 C today Texas. That’s gonna dawg. God said, “What here?! sent warnings doctors masks everything needed stay safe!” obvious could work home, finding somewhere want go -- little people good schools must.

I know exactly talking racism. petty shit. neighbor likes call city grass like 1/8th inch tall mad refuse make major renovations home.

Or ones great face, talk smack neighbors.. I'm like, jeez, want raise kids go biz. want get involved block year sale whatever mean I'm asshole. means want hang assholes lol. Ding ding ding ding, grand prize goes to... Sorry family, damn, fucking stupid. Thank comment, put smile face. what's gonna Brendan Shaub day now? Read book? That's basically Nazi Germany! vote never will, respect acknowledging can't enact state wide mask mandate. Encourage people wear masks good example this. Use health safety occupancy limits set standards full businesses instead unilaterally closing recourse. Support businesses want enforce mask rule requirement enter. There's lot done without encroaching far established necessary freedoms. cost enacting mandates people pushing might evident 20+ years could next year. worth risk? you’re going eating sit much farther apart. Outdoors fairly safe, you’re going around extended period part unmasked, compensate distance. can’t distance don’t it. 6 feet rule thumb regarded minimum. Don’t disagree article UK. I'll argue go far enough. 

These people selfish bastards, they're anti-American. I'll go far say hate America. enough love America American people take simple precautions protect Americans.

I'll go step farther say people biological terrorist treated such. Obama said administration use provisions NDAA signed it, Trump made promises. people literally destroying American economy killing Americans, often going way so, shoot shoot kill. That's easy one lose business. go massive debt never able open business reason rest China far better Hubei fact extensive travel restrictions lockdown measures taken across country around time Hubei entirely locked down. might less severe Hubei, still strict measures taken pretty much country. true intellectual, president something. problem enforcement mask mandate. mandate means nothing enforced enforced local level. honestly see helping much unless made extremely cheap affordable. university professor honestly confused online learning automatically considered dubious. experience spring professors putting much effort, students putting much less. think online learning something get used work wonderfully everybody willing make work. One frustrating aspect huge overlap pro-lifers anti-maskers. Maybe tell fetuses one point, could kill someone pregnant? would require help someone out, pro-lifer kryptonite.  end beginning beginning end. Unfortunately, missed window 2019 going another 32 years get back world horrible. :( say recent statements subsequent events led disbelieve anything current administration says, automod delete comment politics? Yeah flu argument stupid. Even though vaccine perfect zero protection flu it'd way worse. good able realize isnt joke anymore. kinda similar feel like time many people didnt realize weight situation, least see way anymore taking seriously now. Chinese propaganda fucking useless, they're miles away subtlety manipulation Russian propaganda. astroturfers China hire blow cover taking everything personally. “Anti-mask activists” 🤪 America freedumbs!  think logic reason works USA anymore mean, sounds like Gavin let local officials make call, local officials ones fucked you.

Maybe start taking issue local officials. Newsom always maintained local governments could always elect enact STRICTER protections state mandated, jumping chain command take issue governor decisions made county? Anyone know includes Orange County? # # cases:

Yep, definitely seems like Republican problem... Wolf balancing science stupid. I'm Pittsburgh absolute shitshow. Everyone different page far information goes. We're spiking hard made NYT weekend epic fail, yet still selfish pricks crying tyranny suggested wear mask. Nothing enforceable, needs change. Start locking fuckers get past this. trump shit bed January ignoring Washington State's outbreak, we'd enjoying sliver 2020 right flare ups sporadically throughout country. death sentence society death. 

We could nipped ass nope. certainly move pandemic covid endemic. 


Society adapt. Covid HIV aren’t thing. even ball park.   Give rest. Wear mask let rest suffer whatever date awaits them. Stop trying govern rest population win citizen year whatever silly ass shit makes worry everyone else much. Protect yourself...let dumbasses dumbasses...live life. Research shown connection lower intelligence lower mask wearing. So, change way teach teach children. Truth. 

Those us outside hot spots still taking really really seriously *don't* become hot spots. people actually going? go Colorado emergency family last week. definitely plenty wearing masks far way way way people wearing masks home state Utah. shocking going gas station CO side seeing 90% people wearing one crossing UT side seeing 10% people wearing one.

That would really weird article decision make, ""Governor Colorado, furious Covid numbers going state, decides take anger telling Governor California selfish keeping vineyard open."" can't imagine Christie. graduated 1991 thing. Sen. Marco Rubio admitted Monday risk reopening schools cases surge “not insignificant,” would done anyway.  day, Florida reported 12,600 new coronavirus cases, Rubio emphasized outbreak heavily concentrated areas others, suggesting counties could safely reopen. We're fucked. schools open, even fuckeder. November fuckedest.

I fucking hate people charge. Still put farther away, unfortunately. :( 140k dead people along rest world’s response would seem suggest it’s worse flu. Even bartender wear mine eight plus hours Ah yes, testing. forgotten close eyes stop checking diseases, would cease exist! Duh! Yeah lmao  Doland Dutch! Sounds tricky. US would screw kill whole cities, think, without vaccine. prefer Doug Douchey Maybe close country bit instead opening overwhelming hospitals? Smh hope registered vote. really sound like something idiot would say.  Name calling someone realistic reality paint like. American science educator, stupified ashamed completely profession failed people. uk everything reported media. drawing personal experience. choose believe them, sure, premise believable. People sell food stamps Obama phones time, course going sell free laptops, wouldn’t they?? US already normalized 1000 deaths per day citizens. Second third wave matter us anymore. Pfft /s Ok, I'll bite California one dumbest fuckin' states? mean... he’s wrong. could use scrap paper newly ripped notebook roll joint legal weed! got Masters degree collaborative piano 2019. Specializing working singers. spent much day sitting tiny room, making music together work online (latency issues) 3 feet away person whose job inhale exhale much air possible. nightmare right now, can’t believe students know decide whether risk lives, put online school way replaces training, possibly leave field forever. Lots colleges zero plan right handed singing arts students. students supposed plan anything? professors? 

Not coursework done online certain fields. hadn’t finished degree right clue would do. Thank god didn’t go DMA this. Wouldn’t gotten life back together 2025 started last year. couple posts saying deaths exaggerated, saying bad. administration needs end right F now!! Los Angeles largest BLM protest California recorded largest Covid cases.

""Los Angeles County records 3,322 new coronavirus cases, 18 There’s already “alt national park service.” There's stricter order put place thirty worse counties. Includes closing gyms, churches,  People ignorant around Anti-maskers decades research randomized control trials behind prove useless.

Maskers pretty animations models promise Armageddon promote fear.

Especially know death rate low, longer reasonable believe would die continue fear worry getting sick. European tried breads - really need train senses - taste - bit. bread 5g sugar / slice tastes fucking sweet continental Europeans would deny eat that, would eat kind cake. That's fucking heaped tea spoon 1.5 sugar cubes added sugar slice. That's nearly much sugar jam marmelade put slice bread - already bread itself. we’re much worse position began. That’s guv! second wave going look like? mean, really crushing first wave ... ever read Sikhs always helping someone. seem walk talk God’s waiting room death’s door know! ton ""masks freedoms"" people apparently think number people dying acceptable. Canada national shut either. difference provinces took seriously, took measures consistent told health experts. also able taylor response specific province's unique needs. 

Many US States take serious, result. ones did, well, ones California, exploding cases. taught ounce prevention worth pound cure. Gov. would like seriously fight would try prevent people getting people would fight hard treat it. lived significant part life Florida cannot understand continue elect fools. first real encounter harry potter analogy liberals. thought overblown thing chapos, apparently not. ""...some accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask."" Anyone thought Polis talking asthmatic people either non-asthmatic idiots. Nope. Masks worn indoor dining reduced 50% capacity. Country divided president probably would see liberal equivalent Karens refusing wear masks, think enough idiots even among liberals Dems make problem Massachusetts. I'm happy family chose them. seems uncommon like think about. us one left infect anymore Yeah one mentioning federal mask mandate seen you.

All needed effort federal government unite 50 states following similar pandemic responses. 

What public health officials suggesting everyone wear masks stay inside. Like said federal law requiring masks would unconstitutional. *legally* people like Fauci *can* *strongly suggest* people wear masks. combined state quarantines (that states would properly Fed organized rapid unified response plan) literally need get vaccine invented.

There magical law doesn’t violate someones rights reduces infection count time. Since fed can’t legally force people follow public health guidelines suggest people that. ‘suggestion effort’ undermined daily President Republican party, yeah going effective. 

(I mean real proven method would case isolation contact tracing 4 months ago wouldnt problem, that’s unconstitutional.)

You’re aren’t sides-ing one. Science says wear fucking mask. im good let try way: fucking hate mother fucker need start calling Florida Virus. Lets see much trump would like that. ...add failure education decades mask-less zombies roaming around everywhere. Well, course they’re blazing. everything fucking fire. since you.... Crazy england one country still can't get shit together despite place UK significant amount cases. annoying rest us landmass done pretty good job.  insanity going WH 10 alarm fire. time civil. Civil disobedience mad man called her. want really pay teachers risk never agreed career choice. Education already hugely underfunded.

No one denying remote learning harmful difficult students want sacrifice lives. draw line. cannot protect teachers remote learning option. 

Looks like largest school district country agrees hopefully rest follow suit. entitled brat. obviously problems empathy. Land Uninsured, Home Screwed... faith government backs orders appropriate economic policies support...aw shit, kidding. say, longer people wear masks longer postpone opening problem idiot Scarnati band conservative yesmen snarling ability Wolf Levine more. Even clogging system, PA *still* well as, say, Canadian province, least outside major cities (which tend given bit autonomy policy directives).

And Trump deaths permanent injuries hands. reprehensible. Businesses, especially restaurants, ""good"" outcome table. blaming shutdown economic havoc coming whether shut spurious argument. Restaurants fucked. People many restaurants thus fucked happening DIVERSIFIED, that's people warned since childhood putting eggs one basked. Business carries risk, think deserve bailout? 

owning businesses equip evaluate balance public health protection, hospital resources, economics, admission bias want support. want free house mean society cares give one.

I told 6 months' emergency fund non-business owning non-homeowning renter, thus sympathy whatsoever people economic pecking order condescended savings leveraged absolute tits. 

Nah. I'll tell thing told pointed system providing safety net so, I'm working hard went school everything ""right"" - nobody cares personal financial security you, stop looking handout learn code upset poor LOL"" state serious re-opening schools people's safety, least start preparing masks, hand sanitizers, gloves, etc., enough every teacher, student, staff. already teachers spending money buying supplies students. want teachers also buy masks gloves students, we? article? I’d like read clear likely multiple vaccines production. Operation warp speed stockpiling vaccine testing still going upon successful completion already tens millions doses ready ship. downside vaccine snuff trash, making metric ton wasted doses time final science out. mean vaccine complete summer, full production, stored final approval. genuinely felt pang injustice compared them. They're dumb they're country miles ahead Donny! Tbh india great either. started slow starting climb now. Cases 20k+ deaths look 500 day. reminds old college roommate could handle hearing anything negative ever. time told anything wasn’t 100% positive good vibes bullshit, would stop conversation say don’t want hear this. People like fucking delusional, immature, unequipped life, living fantasy world. 90% far part gotten tested timely fashion. pretty sick. least 50% symptomatic.  don’t get anymore. Like literally ILLEGAL appear public space area without mask, still see people going without sneaking places without it, get checkout full cart basket whatever, cashiers kinda blow confrontation would lot harder quickly checking out, morons get away it. There’s excuse anymore, can’t ignore it. Every store clear signage, county released official statement, mean honestly, actual insanity I’m living in. don’t get anymore. Like literally ILLEGAL appear public space area without mask, still see people going without sneaking places without it, get checkout full cart basket whatever, cashiers kinda blow confrontation would lot harder quickly checking out, morons get away it. There’s excuse anymore, can’t ignore it. Every store clear signage, county released official statement, mean honestly, actual insanity I’m living in. Haha would weird right? Someone soap box actually calling hypocrisy double speak. mean, people run businesses it’s livelihood, care them, too. don’t agree close need aid well. like wearing seatbelt.  remember 12-years-old, defying parents told something would get hurt, getting hurt, blaming letting it... Yea I'm bit confused it. That's pretty low Brazil, actually. I’d rather selfish bastard scared ass sheep. You’re right, website company owns 16 hospitals, 8 site emergency rooms, 12 surgery centers, 5200 active doctors idea talking about.

But since cdc probably isn’t reputable enough bothered read it: 

“People asthma high risk developing serious flu complications, even asthma mild symptoms well-controlled medication.” Please insult orang utans, they're amazingly intelligent species.  Kids aren’t tested enough. Look Florida positivity rate among children super high counties, suggesting significant undercounting. That’s common flaw every single school study I’ve seen. equate “case” “infection”. They’re thing. Kids asymptomatic. Thinking they’re immune wildly optimistic. Paintball guns, balls loaded viral-laden droplets is? What's mortality Asians, Middle Eaaterners, etc here?  guy hero. Sane strong voice. Oh come man, giving ideas Right point spot ON! Great, 70 times herd immunity. Politics chokehold American science currently. still appreciated. man.....hate. I'll it, stock portfolio.

Also, go back Texas. last information saw rapid tests promising, month ago. That’s lot suicides.  Oh holy fuck want imagine closer ten percent. Given hospitalization death rates, good data fraction well-tracked populations get sick die. mean, mad too, course. led rallying cries denouncing mayor. thread Gavin Newsom wrapped complicit lack unified California approach. Fuck guy. get virus. nothing piece shit Yeah, like example I'm pretty sure can't get HIV elevator someone it. could learn New York starters. U.S.’s response, lack thereof, annoying there’s several international examples many Americans don’t care say ‘Oh communist nations take away people’s freedom’, yet domestic example New York. What? mean yeah probably many NRA supporters like disconnect see there? Anti-mask person denounces masks puts mask desires buy basic goods...and somehow analogous openly supporting firearm ownership buying well? 

Again, feel like want hate people society ostracize laugh selfish. hey too. Fuck them. Put god damn mask easy. keep framing like main concern logic used not. logic also trash. robots okay say fed bullshit that. need keep offering dogshit explanation. hate care anyone else that. Shame em move on. need pretend respect decision enter establishment maskless cause scene ""principles"". remember that's started, suggested that? ""chickenshit""?  scary - back April USA hitting 2.5K daily deaths. level daily casualties, US would've exceeded total death toll Civil War (which took 4 years) less 1 year. Real talk boss first sentence pretty naive. Economically devastated areas never bounce right back often never all. High hell addicted single narrative move mountains defend. Hella protests happened NYC, spike. Must fake agree story, though. Great job! think Trump trying compete Russia might get us killed feeling people going blaming Obama soon. wait. It’ll last spin left. MEDICAL DEBT DUE OBAMACARE!!!! never mind never bothered come new health care plan. Never mind that.... says fitness centers, pretty loose term CONTROL PEOPLE  is! thank Except that's true. still powerful nation world besides faults. 150% next highest GDP time mean come on. Florida Texas need same. mind individualism. issues folks decorating masks liking. Oh, yeah there's assholes take shit far risk lives fellow countrymen/women. people fucking trash deserve freedumb. Aldo mind Italy government exactly definition effective still managed ( now) turn tide come nowhere 2020, everything fucked beyond salvage years way anything changes lies collapsing.

Which won't. Shit's declared unsustainable two centuries yet finds ways top itself.

can't see wait wild / stupid / heart-rendingly awful shit gets. already limits comprehension, yet keeps growing worse ever faster.

Sad? Sad someone dying avoidable death due exposure. pigs killing people walking sidewalk new plague here. capped sad several years ago I'm amazed.

Maybe possibilities humans utter shits ya gotta admit amazing TV. need upset. Hong Kong people still visit Shanghai Disneyland. call, thanks helpful thought. NFL open season set restrictions developed learned watching happened NBA/MLB.

Over time, learn takes reduce transmission.  Well pneumonia dearth’s something like 750% last year time, so... worst novelty account good execution. Bravo Better since hotspots But... But... flu, cancer car crashes per year combined kill people Covid-19. deniers use excuse then.  probably go well based saw month ago #Da Wild Wild West key estimated part. 

All world deaths probably majorly underestimated. 

Also far burial issues: consider time frame. 570k deaths 19 months different 570k confirmed deaths 7 months. Article original good, white R. nothing see here, worked awesome FL TX far. Thoughts prayers.  amount stress dealing young child (or more!) home you’re also working home absurd.

I get happen, quasi-abusive home environments get worse, typically decent home environments may even start get least psychologically abusive WFH parents wear load.

There’s simply way give 5-8 year old child attention he/she needs also working full-time job. still assessing total vs. ongoing situation.

Things bad now. ICUs maxing several states.

And people think stressed now, guess what? Influenza going take year fall winter. hospitalizes thousands. Bronchitis. Pneumonia. room inn.

Let's discuss summer 2021. See things stand. Trump empty vessel. charge January. I'm waiting Tx, school superintendent Dallas District stated may school football year, that's calling Jesus Christ liberal around parts, HA! mean even duterte better job Trump brain dead governors, ridiculous. anyone worried Trump actually hold funding, am.

Then again, evil Betsy Devos state reopened lemonade stand, pay back $250k medical debts. Bro called office asked send email w documentations again. took step mailed copies too.. sent new card instead... omfg... w nothing either.. lmao tragic. got 2 unemployment cards w 0$ Gerrymandering affect presidential race, Senate governor races, would good start. Yeah man. Make tight connections community can. pandemic pushing people apart can’t let it. people die 1 year flu day 1 corona, conspiracy proven Poor Canada - Idiots continent.

Can’t good athlete stop breath every 30 seconds Man irony getting riled offended comments despite known call left-leaning people “snowflakes.” It’s time don’t take BS. death rate slowly climbing.

Honestly, death numbers arent realtime. area live reports deaths April July numbers. might months sort actual numbers. Less .3% chance 40 don’t bad immune issue, prob I'm going see responsible countries say vaccine first. true. husband talking thing today. 

Use resources/medical equipment/time etc. people deserve care lives lives safety others. people selfish assholes. think big deal, think joke, conspiracy hoax, whatever... surely need care anyway right? behaving way people do, pretty much asking also flaunting fact care anyone else there. heard today Douglas county trying leave TriCounty Health Network want follow mask regulations.

Cytokine storms? Big yikes. Killing people healthy immune systems. Wait...this joke right? I’m sorry timeline ask. Lots talk social networks mask deniers today. I've seen ""wear masks!"" comments I've ever seen.

However, feel like probably live one bigger anti-mask type communities (central Alabama) say mask part Alabama past weekend looked weird. looked weird one nose.

I think people pretty well wearing mask (at least here), since talking shutting things putting kids going back school.

Curious previous ""no mask"" communities seen similar drastic change past week. need convinced already? Good work Cuomo!! It’s rights access healthcare /s seems won’t able slow outbreak quickly rate forgot one. absolutely moronic.

As side note, people keep acting like everything set stone know future holds, make observations educated guesses. Like weather, patterns projections usually correct sometimes get wrong, particularly they're looking immediate future. Covid-19 even unpredictable outcome based actions. 564 people usa die day. 600 today Covid. fantastic idea! tragedy waitin ta happen.....

This probably exciting thing happened lives.   checked Wikipedia page hate even more, think possible! Reported data work 10x many unreported cases least. Suprised happened yet. Flash mob raids. Eh, classroom 4 kids total, 2 teachers (one starts day, second one comes relieve first, always ones). contact limited group 2 others check pick up. So, maybe 7 others.

So, students deciding sue leave schools dust? fully support idea. hell, wants pay full price online classes supplies? main reason places charge full tuition, full use facilities.

I’ll ask, really see relationship? answer not? going say cool.... I'll say anyways... 

Cool! say roughly said then, slightly updated figures: ""Just let spread"" plan, sustain losses 1.5-3 million slow drag out, possibly 15-30 million fast overwhelm hospitals.

Minimizing effort requires eliminating virus, combination measures. get numbers mention above, virus self-limit. can't say ""100k worst-case"" walk away. That's worst-case. That's best-case. That's happens mobilize large sections society fight this, organize well, implement bunch strong countermeasures, succeed. we're seeing worst-case numbers rejected hand, best-case numbers announced reacted shock, act walking away dooms us consider number optimistic retrospect.

You walk away. let spread own. That's move deranged lunatic. psychopath faulty sense ethics, somebody faulty sense universe around themselves. Why? we're going fast; get much choice. soon deaths spike, anybody means stops going work/shopping/eating, REGARDLESS MANDATES. self-limits immediate damage, pushes back herd immunity months, every time happens.

Not eliminating like getting halfway done removing tumor deciding bored besides, death comes us all. tourist spots seem handling well. admit I've missed mountains took family Ouray weekend. messing around. Signs place mandatory mask order. place lunch first day really laid requirements eating establishment. Masks unless table. Questioned us contacts symptoms. one person table go place order. Gave everyone shot hand sanitizer soon put name list. Signs markers social distancing. even sign said something like ""no shirt, shoes, mask, service, dice."" Another place literally build one half-height barn doors entrance physically prevent people coming in, ring gong get served. really appreciated seriously town taking it, overall. I've looked up, they've 12 cases whole county since pandemic started. course, people laying around hotel pool hot tub jabbering away, goofing off, wearing masks, etc perfect weekend, still, seemed like little town handling situation well.  full 1% US population recorded contracted virus, probably short factor ten. large amount people chronic conditions life.

We're WAY past doom gloom, we're way past angry mob status. varied much region. Northern Virginia, properly shut pretty much middle March first week June. non DC suburban counties Virginia went phase one reopening week two based numbers.

I mean vacuum, okay. assumption people mobile, move around spreading infection them.

Seriously, difficult. difficulty fighting stupid thinks masks equal oppression, virus hoax. think using correctly.

I'm presenting choices, making value judgements. purpose prevent disease.

It’s prevent bacteria foreign matter getting *open* incision wound. 

All debate hinges upon whether believe government media hype. people died flu year corona virus. Don’t ask sources. really want know look yourself. info eyes see it... Yeah finished schooling right Sure friend. state even cotton masks effective reducing transmission, despite N95 respirators effective probably surprise. Therefore cotton masks (or likely scarfs) better nothing. probably are. It’s pretty standard new infections start stabilize population sees numbers soaring. Unfortunately, “stable” isn’t nearly good enough it’s gotten bad Oh adorable think schools AC! 
Here New England lucky heat works classrooms many urban schools winter, wealthy districts schools AC isn’t boo hooing people can’t eat favorite restaurants. tragedy workers lost jobs working restaurants. families worked 9-5s whole lives invested savings small business dream, find shuttered. 

Still empathy? don’t try notion lot restaurants closed immigrants paving way America build better future next generation local quizine?

I swear, self righteousness know-it-all keyboard warriors worse sub anywhere else Tuesday bump. shoddily worked death maths 21,000+ Friday, Florida unique case point State/Country 10k daily cases locking everything down.

FloridaMan slapping sunscreen, loading car beers driving full speed towards Disney. serious note level community spread, we're heading two weeks 100,000+ cases Florida. 

This going cause unpredented demand medical facilities. New York saw 9/11 records emergency calls surpassed smaller numbers. Kids day cares child care centers bunch kids adults, what's difference go school? Word don’t think understand nuclear weapons geopolitics work. lot vaccine studies done animals ADE found right  Selfish, self-centered, toddlers one respects respect hate something time, conceivably.

You could also say deserve respect either way shit relentlessly matter what. I'm fine too. Miami epicenter WHOLE WORLD right cases , yet guy says cases starting stabilize  Schools states open 3 weeks... remember explained flu becoming much less severe second wave? ADE occured large scale, would stop second wave cause even severe third wave, etc.? talking Dr Phil? mean contract trace 15000 people. Let's realistic. WAY past that. Beaufort great special place. land I'm sure know stuff - field recordings Gullah community Beaufort Sea Islands generally extraordinary. Best luck you. waste military resources. can’t believe US compared rest world. Hulk Hogan's 26"" pythons nothing her. point, idk masks enough hotspots. effective hard solution remains social distancing. virus shooting us!!! n95 respirator (from covid, used hobby woodworking) want wear protect me. problem respirators outlet valve make exhaling easy. order protect others need wear additional mask (like surgical mask) top! sad thing covid19 going little inconvenience compared consequences climate change... covid19 problem year two most. almost certain heading towards climate catastrophe. question take fucking big catastrophe even fucking bigger catastrophe. started DECREASE emissions severely decades ago.

After pandemic, people want get economy again, going fuck attempts prevent bigger catastrophe. fucked. really possible current global civilization created going ruins. Landed park place. $2000 fee also asthma, like might actually die bad. 

I ran half marathon n95 stupid registered one middle field-burning.

There reason wear basic procedure mask cloth mask. us trying tell guys aren’t rich it’s third would country quite while. We’ll never get first Rather liable employees attacked, may push employers shut shop/board (like weeks ago riots). Like cant even pickup/Doordash food place love DC coz they're yet reopen boarded up. 

A we're effectively back SIP/lockdown. what, Karens? 🧐😐🤨

Look foot.... Well, are. like anti-vaccines. putting rest people danger stupidity. Looking Texas commentary angered anti-mask advocates, accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask. 

Having asthma give excuse wear mask. limit breathing. friends family Philippines. numbers completely wrong many friends trouble getting reliable access food clean water. lockdown really difficult them.  know right, it’s like don’t know raging pandemic there! Circular firing squad?  Nawp sorry, President told gonna go away.

Real smart fuckers Wisconsin told fine. Clearly we're idiots here. Best back vote 😀 Guy, hate man. reliable tests anyways? mean they’re new accurate be. Maybe they’re giving positive results actually case wish could relocate family somewhere else. reason would leave many friends family behind.

Hey maybe lucky America see friends family left! Someone needs make ""No shirt, shoes, mask, service' sign.... they've followed two options forever. Seems like Fauci f**ks give. He's making rounds saying needs said. Thank God. Dammit, got sad miss stuff much. miss able take mom dinner instead waving balcony. OP said private universities going go bankrupt seems like talking private university particular. Plus Texas A&amp;M Public University way state let public university go bankrupt really need think want education country. outta lockdowns, best ya thoughts prayers. teen quaranteams. really helped mental health. biggest plan (potential) leadership COBRA subsidies. employer plan sucks? employer doesn’t offer insurance all? IDK, guys. best we’ve got. 

I don’t know fix this, guarantee this: provide healthcare poorest among us, *will not* get virus control. continue spread kill Americans *at income levels.*  See comment explaining statistics also make sense fact young people ICU Covid many underlying conditions, common related obesity. What? lock like 3 months opened stuff month ago. must misheard friend. Hope invests it. I'm carrier. stay home. They're wrong. article place. unironically. Although aware America's greatness largely mythical, used least time American working class chance successful. I'm shape alcoholic. immune right? /s messed crap huh.. seen john carpenter’s ‘They Live’ ? you’re American, hope you’re voting, that’s way ensure there’ll sixth president Fauci’s watch. Sweden, would could minimize chances exposure diseases chances symptoms would nil start with. mild symptoms, given unreliable antibody tests one rely know one immune, want risk no. Even theory positive antibody test, would still err side avoiding vulnerable people think irresponsible hat Swedish government said ok meet vulnerable people tested positive. said before, dipping toe realm immunity passports way early that. ammendment gives right spread disease again? even then, NY state worst death toll country. Hmm.  wont second shutdown. People dont give shit he’s correct called fallacy relative privation. Sorry vent anger can't people property anymore good excuse.  course there's plan. Run states bankruptcy major fire sale public property pensions fine folks received bulk $4 Trillion (that's $4000 Billion) printing machine spree called CARES act. I've read called California Unemployment Office 150 times single day still never got through. 

This gives little faith things run California...  deaths. lose lose still confirmed positive association week test results came it. would sooner phone lines backed took like 4-5days got neg results wish every Governor would go record say every anti-masker. Gov Wolf PA already hated bad since beginning calling can’t make worse. People listen? far today (417) highest Monday fatality county since 6/15 (432) it'll surpass California Texas finish reporting smaller states add totals. Every Monday since mid-high 300's (369 6/22, 366 6/29, 378 7/6) though Monday 6/8 598 fortunately we're yet close Monday record. we've regressed month runaway train. week may see first 1000+ day since 6/9. uh catch eventually ? really don’t much choice need extra money coming Yes? Interesting countries run right-wing dictators worst. ...What? ***more*** wealth inequality way answer wealth inequality?

Y'all need systemic significant investment public policy, services infrastructure. personal austerity.

edit: is, unless genuinely looking reduce social mobility calcify underclass working poor. case: hope smart enough already seen ends. district sent email hour ago saying ""we totally got this. School opening normal. Masks required! Stay safe!""  Floridians elected one “head in” Desantis lead crisis these. leadership “head in” Desantis Florida rise beat thing without closing anything would wearing mask work every day absolutely nothing combat spread actually weakens immune system.

Wrong again.


Dont know come conclusion every study reaches opposite conclusions. one few. Unfortunately fell cement stairs recently, helping friend move. lot blood, I’m still sore think may pinched nerve. refused go ER as, I’m already debt laid off, without insurance would never able pay ER visit off....this happened within 4 months landing “dream job” finally making good amount money. 🤷‍♂️?  voting blue whole ballot. Every republican guilty association hiding data.
They stopped reporting numbers early X  virus like wildfire absolutely parched field windy fucking day. NYC raging fire got control sent embers country, one tried actually stomp (except HI). got wildfires burning time make intense. 

And I'm afraid really control now. Great dude!!!!! Happy you! we’re July 2020, five months year over, election year well. ""Where draw line?"" sounds like question another time, we're situation like Germany South Korea. really, really think we're ready that. 

And even then, can't really predict many children die late. many unknowns weigh risks way. It’s unclear whether sodium causative effect high blood pressure, used think recent studies called question It’s also selfish fvcktards won’t wear masks properly follow social distancing rules. jPOW trust, amen. Disney’s version shit sandwich is...kind hard swallow. Much Europe higher death rate US... longer wait address virus, harder save economy. Nobody going go shopping feel lives danger. 

There fundamental changes required federal level save country. think you’re right. Things dire. country 3 missed meals away revolution. don’t think that’s appropriate quote, exactly. looks like food supply going fine. evictions foreclosures start full next couple months, country going one step closer real unrest, protests street. open schools turn super-spreaders, little fat kid type 1 diabetic 8 year old going croak. much true. it’s ten city course months? let’s say 8 children color. real chance country won’t make one piece. far asymptomatic organ damage shown permanent. Weird company responded differently virus two different countries! Almost like leadership made difference ? Honestly wasnt around Spanish FLU, cant really say sure, whats documented, then, now, todays standards, know fucking better, sense? Thus much fucking worse (at least USA terms). repeating many pasts right now? Unsurprisingly, except foolish people, populous state screamed past control, right ""overrunning ICU capacity"". Now, I'm sure nonslpain this. But, Hooray! Didny Lan open y'all. Good, hoped Time practice underwater diving. [A ton scientific Europe also higher death rate lost freedoms lockdowns.  
Compare East Asian countries, often saw near universal mask usage even mandates went up.  
Singapore never mask wearing culture, latest data came showing effectiveness, adapted.  anybody thought would going away year even back March would told you, insane Eh, although agree you, didn’t think going win first place, could wrong. Exactly same! several US states already knocked numbers way down. 

Every state would (and be) knocking numbers they're hit hard NY NJ were. Biden fucking joke ill voting him. wins better put whole trump family behind bars. 

LOCK UP. LOCK spread momentarily constrained bit, led people assume/pretend going away. moment fresh news record infections hit, people rightfully cautious again; rinse, repeat. Tis nature human condition. scary part we're learning types negative health effects. friend who's lungs back normal contracted cv early April. pneumonia hospital stay anything like that. Healthy underlying conditions. hit 4 days never bad. getting dizzy spells month recovery amd xray showed ground glass opacity. Doc said seen number cases unknown permanent. isn’t is, again, operating parks already doing. people want angry Disney, get it. don’t act like something new. GM dumb lol. always told others complain blah blah. told yes, lied knew they'd go Karen didn't. Selfish bastards indeed. mean countries even worse deaths per capita US? You’re moving goal posts. First wanted compare NY’s current order RI’s initial order - one targeting NY travelers only, never even enacted next day blanket quarantine order proposed.

Now want use current criteria defend entirely unclear point determined defend. Can’t pick one? live Colorado, wife's nurse provides care people wards state due immense costs medical needs.

She contracted covid late February almost hospitalized. Isolated empty facility cycled staff contracted it, got sick got better.

Wore N95 respirator mask.

The whole.

Fucking.

Time. anyone speak legitimacy media outlet? Honestly, find suspect say article certain brands HCQ ""bought wholesale"" now. anyone know holds true data countries? anyone poke holes theory? always, correlation imply causation, pretty convincing argument. Big bag NOPE. many times proven false. simple google search prove this. 🤷‍♂️🤦‍♂️ Without funding feds, schools can't open - teachers want N95 masks face shields teach 40 students classroom 6 times day (my normal job) cheaper online schooling still feed kids lunches - schools closed actually save money lot building maintenance issues. Last year school got money federal government lost title one status. changed life context literally clorox'ing groceries takeout along wearing mask public places. None hard yet everybody city/town still losing shit every two seconds. Wish moved Canada last year, going get see fiance long time rate. 

Here's hoping get thing together 2021. got link proof this? Would great show parents need that, IMO.

Before enroll, ask see job placement stats last five years graduating classes. university wide, major. Find many jobs campus recruiting. school small percentage placements campus recruiting, don’t enroll. like pretty campus is? It’s girlfriend going? No. Fuck noise. Find program near guarantee job post graduation. exist. Lmfao yes 😂 good thing us austinites bullied right thing Top comment that's case, report US cases state state basis since they're managing crisis own?

Seems needlessly complicated.

Keep political entities grouped together.  Douches gonna douche I’m happy family choose relationship ideology. Absolutely bitchslapped guy’s boss stats. Good stuff! much this. over, expect DeSantis jail hundred thousand counts manslaughter.

One dream....but well.....yea.... California bankrupt, dont think closures last nearly long first round closures gruesome visually gruesome partially say die alone... suddenly home street spitting blood dead hours later even make hospital. I'm way trying say better death. believe everyone died started spitting blood home work first, would different response it. better ask reddit search :) appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* 1/100th time, easy. choose pain suffering! think far ahead.

The delays highly dependent area volume testing. 
Texas shortages. 
The good news Houston’s drive municipal county run sites closed afternoons due heat. 

I don’t know effective accurate results talk patient swabbing sinuses though. Yes. Functionally, schools serve babysitters people work. Virtual near useless, doesn’t solve key issue. like Newsweek posted that, gives credit think that's thing. thing. wear mask fine, even severe asthma. Anyone making claim can't talking ass. say NZ done amazing, optimal set virus moving around stealth mode near long Euro countries example. saddest part whole thing. Everyone dies Covid alone, without loved ones. Yet wearing mask goddamn much people. words, put analogy school. everyone class homework class ends, could leave early enjoy rest day. need Karen Kevin best behavior teacher won’t us homework.

It also pretty clever giving politicians spouses friends, well billionaire Kanye West's company, publicly traded companies.

Edit: also, misread comment. $7 trillion fed go PPP. part government stimmy plan also bailed corporations directly. fed buying corporate debt junk bonds pushed money treasuries keep market imploding... fed government different entities. Remember people used say would go away heat, days. hate man, guy. cant get level pride faces. I’m gonna go outside lay Highway 🛣 👋 😑😑😑 Polis win!

A population 10 million easily sustain thousand deaths per year (for example Michigan invested road safety like western EU countries would probably save 200 300 people per year (or 30% road accidents), yet don't).

The problem keeping level becomes dangerous. Living like 2019 really option prevent exponential growth. government choose focus efforts limiting spread schools, limiting capacity service industry, strong contact tracing quarantine procedures, social bubbles mask laws.

She apartment university 12 month lease. asked come home March agreed. Since early May, would comfortable going back. chose home rather back apartment. choosing help kids get pandemic making one week lives really fun.

You may think know motivation character. wish would stick looking saying. don’t think going vaccine. do? Facts facts fuck’em Sounds like perfect fit Florida. pesky Public Health regulations.

It's every man himself. decent amount, actually! said, unquestionably Rhode Islanders driving back forth daily basis New Yorkers summer homes. take lot 30% Herd immunity earn name. 30% immune people R0-value much lower immune people factors same.

However numbers seeing northern hemisphere bit misleading summer. People outdoor also lower R0-value. bad people see numbers go makes relax.

I words season common cold flu kicks due people spend time indoors due colder weather number cases Covid-19 see increase unlucky - really big second wave. shut Florida, non essential businesses closed down. However turns everything Florida, except bars nightclubs essential. look us now. We're #1!!! Hey: believe schools stay shut vaccine coronavirus. 

Yes, one coming within next six months people, already one fasttracked large scale human trials E.U.

However willing give children sacrifice altar ""We open schools cost!"" Maybe miss school shootings? That’s_fine.jpg... issued mask order? live Colorado kept CO current events subject. Nah like time arrested leaving campus asked leave assaulting police officer time arrested creating website sexual harass ex bf  intentionally include pictures anti lockdown protestors reason? I’d imagine lot artists using quarantine time honing craft. one hand students mad taking courses online. hand many (not highly responsible) cannot bothered take pandemic seriously take simple precautions like wearing mask social distancing. 

Though government bears responsibility much failure would sympathetic students frustration dodging herds maskless students everywhere go. want person classes wear mask. support evidence tho - going back forth daily basis, arguably worse. I'm RI well -- WAY day-to-day transit &amp; RI New Yorkers beach homes. live PA. “selfish bastards” suing amusement park around Pittsburgh due forced wear mask “triggers anxiety” autistic daughter. 

Magically, idea going crowded park amidst epidemic protecting virus kill DOESN’T trigger anxiety. 

Meanwhile Hersheypark mom manufacturing 3 minutes fame videotaping crying 10 year old asthma park wouldn’t let park according her, doesn’t need follow requirement. 

Forget fact apparent asthmatic son exposed thousands people without mask may kill him. 

Seriously. I’ve lost much respect American humanity past four months. absolute joke world. Damn live US never really understood kinds situations healthcare put in. Forcing go debt basic human right barbaric. extra debt would pay probably end going top 0.1% well. told boss said take temp coming wear mask. said tests positive ""we go get appropriate people"". Whatever fuck means. *Edit - means wants go work still* strict measures general population care homes?

Workers care homes head toe PPE face shields. Yeah, guy responded trying say “it’s over.” isn’t humanity ending virus. doesn’t mean infections aren’t bad worrisome. It’s don’t need worry humanity ending know it.

But sure, I’m one that’s deep end.

Just go stay basement, man. won’t catch sunlight either, won’t worry handful conditions. think read likes cold weather, seems like weather. politics. one wants one make decision drop hammer. say “let county handle it” “let cities handle it” “let state handle it”. nothing gets done except half assed partial closings combined people giving shit (having nothing lose) What's deaths per capita Sweden versus country touches them? police force billion dollar budgets have? Trump probably live well 90s, sadly, parents lived long lives trump probably better health someone else around age despite lifestyle feeds. may obese, it’s “fuck you” kind obese head going for. man showman keeps people talking despite much hate him.

It may absolutely utter BS, law feelings anyway. absolutely prove nothing else matters. words exchanged owner, owner yelled him. Things got much tense, however mention making threat point anyway. showing, touching, pulling, stating would kill harm. would absolutely used secondary refrence court threat ever made anyway.

Dude asshole sure, walked fine line, never crossed line would get charged. Everybody directing anger schools reopening right needs shift lil right cuss people responsible bailing huge corporations instead individual taxpayers choose childcare bill can't afford income all. wait It’s elementary school. 

The kids need guidance individual help. teacher used covid excuse less bare minimum basically take paid vacation. 

Furthermore, kids assigned shit entire time. teacher wasn’t involved never let kids take anything beyond first topics assigned. kid behind compared kid regards topics covered conversely covered. 

She didn’t job pissed. isn’t slight Khan Academy. CCP bots strong here. lmao 1% Florida’s population 220,000 lives lost. think economy won’t tank many deaths? That’s covid. hospitalizations take beds diseases too. 

Just get straight, shutdowns work. separate people slow rate people entering hospital slows spread covid. ultimately saves lives turn saves economy. less intelligent monkeys. installed people malice intent. thought sounded like good politician. Good knows bull shit day people want hear. Stating prepared information. Sounded completely opposite headlines Florida see. whatever is, it'll help frontline. can't picky especially yet reach flu season. least hospital able get n95, hospital wife works sees far Covid cases still hasn't. vaccine gives level immunity it'll save lives. people like California back stage 1 Idc who, I’m voting blue way down. moved November, seriously missing taxed Connecticut right now. I’m appalled governor here. really need happen me. mom brothers teacher, gonna bad come September things change. overheard talking plan respond gonna work Sorry, cut mustard.

It's commentary peer reviewed article. scholarly equivalent letter editor newspaper.

Further, coming months years many studies done, likely conflicting results. long time solid facts regarding this, cannot rule child-to-child spread disease vector prevailing consensus absent concrete evidence contrary foolhardy open schools juncture. Sorry. general IQ American population low ever occur. going one long, painful road herd immunity. obsessed watching February March, crazy.

Now it’s quite clear dodgy fuck it’s rich people buying shit, it’s people like (no offence)

All billionaires losing stocks hit Trump fed pump little injection there.
You don’t get B club without connections.

I remember Trump announcing America fly zone March DOW fell cliff saying it.
That me, ‘me you’ bailing running, it’s bunch billionaires laughing. patient administered open window. There's vaccine ground, several meters below.  Regarding opening schools U.S...

I saw report yesterday german television, scientists traced tested schools saxony single corona-cases, monitored little spread among kids.

This **may** good sign regarding opening shouldn’t eat healthy? Bet say likely die sleep long.. there’s middle ground everything smh reminds HR person company worked two decades ago. ANYTHING would say would answer for, whether applied question not. specific answers asked something fit answers, she'd give anyway. Like robot picking limited set choices using one closest trigger-word. live Florida (sadly). love amusement parks, once, unless something new added, missing anything. parks thought, ""Was worth money?"" people, yes, things wait.

Especially right now, global pandemic, hobbies leisurely activities take backseat safety. enjoyable things mentioned magically disappear next year year that. things still enjoyed; biggest focus timing excursions. 

This best timing. Even currently pandemic, Florida summer awful time check parks. combination heat/humidity, coupled scattered thunderstorms, good timing. rightfully should. That’s they’ve caught illegal tourism west.  There's plenty research saying masks effective, none saying 100% effective, especially cloth masks. think case studies would particularly informative: know get infected mask, less likely. That's think they're available.

Look reviews mask studies estimates much masks prevent, interested that. worry, rich, able get it.  I've never seen accountant graduate degree making $13 hour. Florida? I'm West Palm Beach company always looking qualified accountants since we're always growing. hired 3 week actually - staff 2 senior accountants. advice, learn good Excel. Take course macros advanced Excel money. maybe current employer pay it.

Edit: Sorry see Orlando. read comments hello Mr. Giant Strawman.

Please bother responding manner discourse. Sounds like even Doctors want back Ken Karens. hope get stuck large legal bill deter similar lawsuits. agree this, needs caveat Florida entering untested waters. 

They're seeing five-figure cases daily, cue others lock down, mandate masks take preventative measures - Florida none time writing aside county restrictions.

We broadly see 15k figure next ten days least - people see complications emerge, State ICU numbers already high, horrific regardless much knowledge improved. Good ya. went picked trash local mountain yesterday. Can't plugged bs 24/7. USA USA! Meanwhile Massachusetts, we’re nearly ready crack open movie theaters again. might hot take, straight up? It’s less US country mucking COVID, several specific states (Looking FL, CA, TX, GA!) reeeeaally screwing pooch badly.

I'd....rather not. 😐 Pls use third party tool selecting news sources. tell sources biased well ones issues Deaths going spike like New York New Jersey. Doctors know overuse ventilators -- ventilators kill patients -- variety therapeutic tools, putting patients prone position (stomach) sleep Remdesivir. 

.  pick baby yoda go? looked cute welcome back video. hazmat suit laundromat can't go myself. second place opens even little bit cases surge. 

The options complete global shutdown til vaccine found open things up, mandate masks deal it. Hard breathe can't understand others saying. Wait thought 18k US 151,700-575,400 worldwide estimate BUT, BUT, ... free Market! Fuck Everything bigger Texas. /s interesting terrifying article CNN morning. Antibodies Corona Virus, like type Corona Viruses, rapidly decline humans recovered this. seems People get sick might never achieve herd immunity... society built around preventing much death possible, we'd police officers stationed every bathroom cameras every 15 feet.  [check Cell immunity unproven. (With COVID-19)

Don't ridicule one theory put another pedestal neither proven. apparently never went ventilator realize wearing mask slight inconvenience comparison. think saving years years order make possible qualifies anything even remotely resembling 'rich' must either young, low skilled unable move profession. hundred thousand dollars worth liquid savings difficult accomplish two decades continual career advancement reasonable investment. I'd rather give rage outrage assessing situation coldly.
Both US China causing insane amount trouble worldwide, fashion. 

However believe calling people get emotional complex issues manipulative counterproductive. European Union trying fast track Astra Zeneca vaccine -- requires two doses turn COVID-19 minor sore throat cough -- eliminating final phase experimentation forcing governments initially assume 100% liability, 50% shared manufacturer, increase 100% liability held manufacturer. vaccine currently considered safe, need remains evaluate lasting efficacy. plan would basically mean widespread vaccination phase 3 ongoing, emergency use authorization European Medicines Agency. Yep. Students worried classes online not. degree. Experience compliments degree, can't get college. numbers using get 0.04% ? I’ve putting pressure since March. responses received school board, district, department education mocking concerns. gone silent. responses. Governor, rest longer reply. earlier responses lack care public health back pocket seeking votes. Except death count scale absolutes; it'll error margins, potentially wide ones. think thinking absolutes - deaths inaccurately attributed covid, must ""no idea"" numbers are. prefer spelling Governor DeathSentis, know sure him.

Thanks man I’m 30. Wake rock pit stomach thinking id parents got sick died this, whether city love ever recover effects pandemic lockdown, I’ll ever see favorite people places again, etc. positive I’ve found made realize over, simply continue allow mental illness prevent living life fully.

American college education system overpriced years

Yeah, right there. crazy much education costs. think Putin enjoy fucking EU? nationalism ramping place feels like repeat 20th century, minus world war 1, know guy got sick away home got plane come home, sick, got test found COVID-19.

They're even taking temperatures noticing signs. I'd fly right million bucks. suspect 20% democrats. repugnican twats killing they’re taking innocent people them. CLOSE BORDERS... sheesh, enough fines... people care lost job... Americans enough savings see crisis... fines mean nothing.

Soldiers rifles turning cars around border... works. chart showing daily new cases Florida right perfect need visual demonstration exponential growth curve..... work finance company designs sells home security equipment. forgot foreign worker dormitories existence, totally screwing part. Otherwise local containment quite decent ""by world's standard"" would like phone friend please. cell immunity still unproven COVID-19 antibodies.

People putting hope next thing. (Which ok guess long people peddle truth.) Another person making optimistic assumptions COVID-19. Yeah, shouldawouldacoulda guess. day 1 mandated, felt need use one I'm working home fairly removed city centers, easy say that. 

We seem okay whole, can't seem stop popping wrecking place. There's town road completely separate phase 1 style lockdown they're suffering again. 

I suspect mixture protesting easing rules caused many suspect pretty much over. ain't, ain't going anywhere good while.

And good luck friend, stay level headed safe possible. Herd immunity come vaccine. issue many people die. shifting 401k's might literally stupidest thing I've ever heard of. cannot believe got rid pensions ability tie end life income performance rich people I’d say airline policy keep people safe, one chooses fly airline said policy, don’t enforce policy, one would likely shot. said, they’d show damages.

“Owns condo, plans buy another house, plans buy investment property”

Ok. They've included screenshot shows deaths rising three four weeks number confirmed cases started rising.

How blind link screenshot proof deaths start rising weeks cases start rising? lol, orange county Rui probably reporting lag 1-2 weeks... CDC data itself:

\*Data period incomplete lag time death occurred death certificate completed, submitted NCHS processed reporting purposes. delay range 1 week 8 weeks more, depending jurisdiction cause death.

Percent expected deaths number deaths causes week 2020 compared average number across week 2017–2019. Previous analyses 2015–2016 provisional data completeness found completeness lower first weeks following date death (&lt;25%), increases time data generally least 75% complete within 8 weeks death occurred. dude probably college debt that's good start. sad part republican lumped rest Trump sheep.  engineering company people boat many educated republicans cannot say same. Ya, 2 weeks. cases exploding longer 2 weeks though. Deaths increasing right now, going down. mean, business require wear shirt shoes inside building, can't also require wear mask? Seems pretty straight forward. Alabama entered chat. Hospitals reaching capacity, even lower Alabama now. makes think so? u think opening school? send Spicy V8 hacked life kiss goodbye death. long wait symtoms appear able say coast clear COVID send hospital/grave? I'm aware wait least two weeks serological test, one reliable? make mask wearing socially required as, say, pants wearing. Sure, people go without pants, would considered socially weird. many them.

I think recent poll showed 80% Japanese would think badly anyone outside without mask, whereas, country, reverse true. change that: masks need social norm, leadership top would help that. issue, bubble area that's epicenter spread. someone breaks bubble likely get virus.

Agreed. total amount socializing breaking isolation much less bubble would players' normal fact testing backogged one day someone broke quarantine becomes likely someone catch covid19 bubble test it.

I think true. People pay get results quicker labs think NBA paying priority response here. that's case results delayed days major problem bubble together non insignificant chance whole NBA catches covid19 increasing chances number big stars long term complications.

For think tiny. There's long list guidelines keep many players getting together.  guidelines set relax bit future stages could room concern. exposure workers happens see positive tests think would sum separate better chance one player getting it. However, together much higher chance entire team gets aggregate would make likely player complications ends career.

We'll see. really appreciate good response though. get plastic face shields interfere breathing. There's really good excuse using anything want go store.  Please tell plural Karens Infection 🤣 make internet utility yet? solution (partly) high fines people wearing masks states taking seriously stemming outbreak. Want go NY anywhere New England, fine? walk anywhere without mask, $1,000 fine. ifs, ands buts it. Unfortunately still gives opportunity infect many unwilling people want. Maybe pay treatment every person got sick... can't understand virus instantly kill people thus creates lag time deaths.. Well, smart ones least Oh no, nightmare able hear people saying... Welcome fucking life hearing loss! Hell, can't even use lip reading. 

So, going keep bitching able hear, going try solve problem? 

It's completely possible ask someone repeat said, ask articulate talk slower. Last resort: TEXT! It’s like first time history pandemics, internet teach kids safety homes. It’s perfect, least mitigate educational losses, save lives health, eliminate psychological trauma working learning unsafe/ high stress environment.

And doesn’t permanent scientific, agreed upon plan leaders certain benchmarks met safety open back up!!! least, re-evaluate fall semester! Well open things deal comes. Reddit....😁 NYC worst outbreak entire world, forced nursing homes take Covid patients (a highly contagious disease huge fatality rate elderly - yes, knew time), failed make sure proper PPE protocols stop spread homes, made families lost loved ones could sue nursing homes stopping spread homes negligent. Somehow gets free pass. wonder reason could be?  honestly zero memory living times H1N1... lived SARS. remember SARS. H1N1? many died ICU already? Complete global shutdown simply impossible fuckin rate, won't. I,feel comment. claim seems based actual study. N=40 though, seem especially vigorous.  Yeah experience downtown San Francisco disturbing homeless. humans become numb. issue disease doesnt selectively target people, indiscriminate. Hes clearly willing die stupidity attempt teach stupid people lesson, cant fix stupid. cruel man inside thought”Fuck that. need send people help refuse help first.” 

It’s like feeling sympathy relapsed drug addict. POS it’s possible save changed better. Basic rule "" customer always right behave civil way"" culture customers abusive fuck want must stop good keep healthy.

Like guys could, opening. also entirely ignore result death life time lung issues resulting lower life expectancy entire generation just... fine? Because, hey least dead little Jimmy needs state funded baby sitter daddy go back factory?  deaths among teachers compare general population?

I believe same.

BECAUSE CLOSED DAMN SCHOOLS. Na fuck bruh! fuck need unions! nothing liberal devices subvert true blooded American Republicans.

Where social distancing maintained, cases kept control. people work (more less), shop, maybe go outdoor bars restaurants sufficient distancing.

What can't large gatherings, go inside other's homes, indoor physical activities, sing, shout otherwise talk close-up face face, use changing rooms.

Even clusters, long exception rather rule, liveable. crazy Trump managed spend much money devote much nations focus something still manage make economic public health situations worse would done nothing. money spent giving friends unneeded bailouts, national international goodwill exhausted, PPE stockpiles diminished everyone worse position deal situation - literally worst possible way things could going stage, resources squandered early-game nothing show it. Yet republicans sit grinning like idiots acting like everything's good could be, course change second democrat get's power - suddenly everything biggest calamity world they'll calling impeachment every second day. Mickey Mouse happy title say Orlando. government needs pay parents stay home work (or hire sitter). Ok you’re clearly moron.

Nobody claiming masks would prevented virus spreading together. reduce risk transmission. Key work reduce. suggestion masks, N95, surgical cloth, useful would led Americans panic buying them. look happened toilet paper. wider public cannot trusted act responsibly (and you’re making good example yourself). course greater good. hospital staff didn’t access masks, would caught disease would nobody care patients required treatment thus costing significantly lives. 

Yeah publish it. publish information they’re given authors study couldn’t confident data so, I’ve said twice now, Lancet appropriately retracted paper. don’t see you, someone who’s inept literally cannot grasp basic principle benefits mask wearing, think right criticise professionalism integrity one oldest, respected widely read medical journals world. It’s perfect example Dunning-Kruger effect, ironically president also seems victim of.

And regarding “evidence” effectiveness HCQ, thats one study. Multiple others shown benefit, see think medical degree 6 years working Internist given enough knowledge experience know SARS-CoV-2 different virus influenza thanks advice. really ironic right ones super pissed everything ones breaking everything. Lmfao Abbott, literally many deaths thinks get away still win another general election. way get lock would show poll numbers election loses 10+ points. antibody tests known produce 50% false positives

No, might produce 2%-0.3% false positives, depending test used. False negatives common, depending person tested falling ill SARS-COV-2, serology testing might miss 50% 5% cases (50% false negative person still ill, 5% weeks recovery).

However, taken account UK testing. assessed performance serology test determine false positive false negative rate used knowledge statistical two, generating IFR based estimates infection rate using prevalence antibodies donating blood transfusions.

***Also, overall IFR 1.1% rather high, suggesting survey may overestimated, rather underestimated, systemic meta-analysis dozens studies IFR COVID-19, including earlier version UK study, found IFR ***0.68%,*** though might vary due age structure, medical care co-morbidities population. 1.1% high end certainly rules underestimate.

Also, there's widespread issues testing Democrat, Reddit lately much. bunch bandwagon hoppers wanting bark. Listen, learn, form opinion.  Canada welcome (once COVID over)! seriously think 50 million people going die this? said mortality rate 25's 0.1%

Except even close that.  sort makes feel like sucker it? I'm going vacation North Carolina next week. I'd sip vacation (check post history want see trip bad idea) one biggest reasons I'm going get heck outta Florida week. I'm literally choosing week-long family reunion 27 people get Jacksonville, FL. Florida get 5% population fatality rate think. 20% chronic issues. 60% mild permanent damage minimum (which includes two groups). Basically, health insurance ever affordable again.  appear “relatable” common plebs.  Didn’t California shut March 16th?  doesn’t quotes saying 14k kids die. never actually says that. see edited comment.

The CDCs IFR based serology testing estimates third population SARS-CoV-2.

There reason saying base policy serology tests. final stage development. We're almost say many. I've never heard anyone talk outside sub.  can’t compare them. US far tests per capita You’re getting tied knots someone said “hey” email? extra death may due paralyzed Healthcare systems around world rather covid honestly problem counting covid well. still volcanoes Honestly, start asking it. Parents need pressure schools want kids stay home. government side people issue.

It's daily topic r/Teachers. Lol anybody think schools pass savings students? know, that'd like US-level failure right there.  parents kind say whether send kids school? enough parents say, ""no, I'm sending school""? hell guy said ""fuck it, I'm out"" quit beyond me. not. I've heard ""they call workers state run personnel, move patients cities.""

Not 8 states region problem you. mean two countries yes. French levels lower Spain, places countries 10% showing antibodies.  got worse second time. tested clean twice. less sick first time. Etc....

Sòrry fit narrative hundreds thousands cases documented. (To say nothing undocumented) GOOD. people I’m less sympathetic towards professors cops. Haha! Florida ordered coroners stop releasing coronavirus death saw article showing govener Texas go shut down... people would suffer, though majority voted so...., Texas get assistance. gotta help first, look like wants help....

Remember thought 2017 bad?  Seattle fastest growing major metropolitan city US last decade, there’s constantly 30 plus cranes building high rise buildings apartment complexes, one another. sister city Bellevue. would hard imagine city growing changing faster Seattle last decade, I’m thankful don’t live anymore, still beautiful city though. yes, economic system whic requires unbounded growth planet finite ecological resources self-destruct. might roll start deducting cases

We hope Anti-mask idiots proclaim everyone else sheep act like lemmings. making hysterical assumptions views couldn’t wrong. Read comment replied to, read said, try see basic reading comprehension skills. psychiatric RN hoping would luck, I'm tired things esp healthcare Dead people pay bills? sentence ""I'm even sick"" still uttered time?! People's stupidity knows limits, apparently.  Africa rise, behind rest world catching up. Combine COVID desert locusts civil war going get bad many places across continent. Except “no mask “ lie early undoubtedly killed hundreds thousands people. Except that, yeah, great guy. Seems like pretty solid pay rise me. hate break 90% Americans would qualify immigrate Canada laughed said 2 million deaths end September. interesting thank article, don’t know trustworthy twitter account story still stands.

However hospitals still overrun 7 day average still rising. I’d interested see 100% positivity lands end.

Also I’m fed up. “Here’s shocking news uncovered!” Zero sources proof given. actual hell. Well, older people usually drain economy normal times guess logic, time start systematic murder grandparents!  incompetence guy. Can't Impeached? live 12 story senior apartment building Florida. informed via piece paper shoved doors kinda exposure building. Nothing renter, people visiting person works here. mayor finally issued mask mandate. people still refuse wear them, take elevator, cameras elevators. refreshing consider hurricane season senior tower - everyone lives supposed 62. went 80s. standard? I’m pessimistic chances, drastically different situation. actually *is* losing support, personally know several die hard supporters completely flipped him, rejected Republican Party entirely. 

I also don’t see complacency kicking anywhere near bad — people need comfortable complacent, people anything but. especially true evictions kick high gear double whammy schools opening generally favorable conditions respiratory illness transmission kicks fall gets COVID going much worse even going now.

Biden also Hillary — ran dirty primary campaign, stink involvement Bill still, generally cold unlikable person. voted her, wildly unenthusiastic it. Biden isn’t top choice, *like* Biden, don’t feel like hold nose vote — think unremarkable solid president, sounds *extremely* appealing right now.

So yet ready give hope yet, also extraordinarily precarious situation. 2020 going pivot point US one way another — either going wake call needed, finally going see things change better, beginning end us. Returning status quo seem option, November decide side knife slide down. still hope slide good side, keeping eyes wide open could also definitely go bad side, interested seeing takes us next decades.  result masks, although many people voluntarily wear them. result people using brains, socially distancing opening things quickly.

We people jamming bars restaurants throwing corona parties. almost country realizes pandemic. vaccine thoroughly tested properly. think roll dice take chances disease vaccine undergone rigorous testing released much paid delete comments internet?  We’re screwed  America somewhere. Fucking get think happening right cause massive uptick cases hospitalizations?

And think death outcome care about? novel virus idea long term implications getting it. teachers? Yes. get paid absolutely nothing comfort home.

For kids? robbing future. parents? stealing livelihood. problem even believe 132,000 number fake. talking point many hospitals falsely reporting COVID-19 death get funds. Depends. get hotel rooms full kitchens.

Edit: Oh ruin narrative? also forgot mention get hotel rooms monthly rates well. Paying per diem extended stay plain dumb. Cringe. Someone want give boris nudge rethink pay freeze uk nurses U can't sacrifice f**king humans statement, better economy anything all. People would die, actual living people life family. Wtf wrong you! Hello? Obama care? responsible scrapping one?? really? I'm hearing conflicting things would real failure contact tracing outbreak among adults connected within one two degrees particular school figure out. Maybe Hillary bad choice all. terrible schooling issue; really schooling either. Lack human communication around 5-7 years old causes major issues. Even shitty attempts still help develop language processing, developing language processing something can't put off. Idiot parents work engage children, cannot engage children adults school, children issues later on. Deaths lag numbers month, even treatments may getting better people survive they're still going left scarred internally significant risk early death live generally awful life constant blood thinners, breathing problems, random new health issues thing Percent positive stable dropping little. Hospitals fine. Estimated R0 dropping. We're going OK. heck making $13 per hour masters accounting? Everyone know starts least $20 straight bachelors? live extremely low cost living area something? They've done lot places accomplished absolutely nothing. world properly. always right thing, sadly, virus, that's enough. But... But... There's EVIDENCE happen. /S man 79. think gives fck failed businessman narcissist 'president' opinion. believe genuinely cares keeping people safe. 

He must known beginning matter time orange one would turn him. 
 
Damn must frustrating people rather listen idiot expert.  It’s hubris arrogance. fail understand “leaders” choose logic science. speak 1. Rule - something... Stay tuned maybe contact 😉

Edit: number name comment here. worthy contacted. (Underscores dashes accepted quietly judged.) didn’t say anything T-cells ignored them, true important ignoring makes title false unless proof T-cells role play don’t. real problem, agree you. people shopping marketplace employer (if one) offer insurance. jobs offer insurance pay well, therefore making plans get marketplace unaffordable given wage.

It's sick joke. 2 weeks caos /s expensive colleges. middling state school $5k per semester.... Wow, that’s alarming amount venom towards total stranger. Please reel in. Speaking like towards someone don’t know part problem. idea much hate Trump. allowed disappointed option. sucks able calmly express rational opinion without attacked. weren’t people behaved rudely regard people’s feelings. even know person 5 seconds making rude assumptions. care live die don’t know anything you. people little fucking nicer considerate towards one another, country would mess currently in

Edit: Example: Anti-maskers = rude strangers make assumptions don’t care people live die. world could use lot less lot kindness  Don’t jump water don’t know deep is... 45 years old. underlying health issues. really wish people would take virus seriously. live NY. Someone works place vacation FL. apparently essential come right back work. understand anyone thinks vacation good idea right now. 3.5 million people America confirmed virus.

That leaves pool 325 million American potential become infected. family friend keeps bringing up. whole family covid-19 positive including teenage son needed hospitalized. saying hospitals full need COVID funding. asked brought son ER replied actually needed it. Mind boggling. Fear looking weak. finally wore mask back.it military walking him. will. amazing city. fantastic job overall, still 'fuck ups,' know? ever needs vacation tips hit PM. I'm active Chicago subreddit. Stay safe bud. ex went NYC last week. like...E, really? bunch NYC friends visited house yesterday.

I probably block insta given breakup month ago, damn guess people really care anymore distancing  Board Education perpetuating rampant anti-intellectualism know trouble.

There's reason say social distancing except making political statement. egregious borders criminal. putting students, students' family members, teachers, teachers' family members, staff also staff family members risk. what? want prove point? know many people asthma, flu never affected us high risk manner. meant NY big state lot people would rather go Montana ok. Supreme leader snoke says go away. 

Sorry, meant supreme leader Trump. area business sold meals families (think something like “smello mesh” wink wink), reasonable price would totally subscribe 2-4 meals week. Especially since you’re chef! idea...like local meal subscription. Good luck you, work 14 months, start new job 2 weeks shut down(here nj) feel pain. American politicians still want dig heads sand pretend exist. 

Not even kidding, holders public office believe pandemic real. fucking wouldn't. Liberals would comply mask requirements large trust science experts. Trump's dumbass followers deny science masks. LOL, that's selective math right there. That's true Europe. possible US, wealthiest nation Earth, can't deliver safe water citizens?! finished yet still long term effects  teachers union. Imagine grocery store employees felt entitled teachers did.

And say ""they remote learning"" - already shown work. death count rises it’ll look like it’s nothing! /s

But seriously that’s probably it. Americans incapable understanding preventative measures. worth, American option people donate miles. truly decide make break, I'd look options have. 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 We're fuuuuuuuuuuuucked got paid lol need see historian future talking reason hygiene measures transformed political stances, least rich countries New York state day without reported death since started counting. New York City days reported deaths, early epicenter, state, yet. Hopefully get soon. ‘But wait! There’s more!’ mean fly american weekly still. pretty good seen flight crews yell people masks.  often people starve death suburban Texas? nations 2% unemployment?

Do count German system Zero hours contract precarious workers?  didn’t require basic math. even sure immunity possible yet. *China Contact Tracing best public health method used limiting spread COVID-19. process quickly identifying people may come contact infected person collecting information potential contacts. 

It also successfully used help stop spread Ebola West Africa COBRA fucking joke - offer continue insurance EXORBITANT prices lost job income shameful. death toll covid 5x times higher cause deaths outside hospitals , deaths occured 6 months vs year causes. Remove internet please. We’ll compare death rate 2019 death rate 2020 give clear picture total impact. mostly talked swine flu back then. Also really big deal. actually believing protest nothing spikes let’s know gullible y’all really people get sore throat cough -- people get deathly ill. agree Trump Europe demand early release liability protection pharmaceutical companies hospitals. Americans flip out, say he's following Europe's lead. country litigious liability protections even important Europe -- say someone left center. Let's get vaccine ASAP -- even random people bad reactions die, better alternative, vaccine appears extremely safe; question effective be. said, also clear, according EU, vaccine requires two doses, even reason getting early. wondering would’ve handled better Gillum elected Desantis probably would’ve sole fact Gillum Democrat. don’t think Democrats properly manage Corona, fact Desantis say hands months infuriating chose Trump constituents. friend works governors office blew fucking mind conditions working in. one wore masks, one social distanced (this months ago, i’m unsure know he’s still working!). still people coming work well pandemic could’ve easily done jobs home. didn’t even move safer secure facility away state offices. friend tried defend Desantis’ inaction “letting counties decide.” Really? disjointed response pandemic best way tackle it. actually starting like Desantis too, anything better greasy, gross, slimy, nasty, gross, evil, greedy, slithery, gross Rick Scott. Yuck! think medical degree 6 years working Internist given enough knowledge experience know SARS-CoV-2 different virus influenza thanks advice.

So making shit resorted name calling... Great sign intelligence. completely copying improve healthcare lower taxes. 

I doubt that. Everything American society interconnected. Economy, education, healthcare, politics, etc. can't completely change one inevitably destabilize rest.

If US could copy another countries functioning healthcare system would done so. fact current interconnected society makes money people power, allow anything change. selfish fucks ones small towns still think rona hoax MSM trying bring Trump. Masks infringing ""rights."" businesses totally disregard governor's orders. Yeah...ran quite ""selfish fucks."" two way street, man. Jesus fucking Christ

Edit: found it. hand, quite good social system around 70% medical fee covered state, retirement pensions (even though screwing us over), unemployment money (even though screwing us over)...

Salary big still social state Yeah. think two viral lung infections time gonna end well even healthy people. tuition-industrial complex, like things neoliberal, credibility anything. 2020, American colleges universities corporations whatever takes make sure eat first. internet access 10% issue. could give kids best internet access planet still learn anything. Link chances Trump pushes declares pandemic over? January It’s quite terrifying see antisocial misanthropic lot people here.  while, flying new Microsoft Flight Simulator. want even go airport working vaccine. New York first place country experience massive influx cases caused that. time, know treat covid, supplies, testing, etc. Good idea. I'll start getting ready whenever decides stop Palm Beach. Come guys, 2 weeks  confirm, friends Michigan June -\_- feeling Obama pushed hard bridge making right. treated like scum. need treat right way nazis treated ww2. don’t that’s true. Live work “purple” counties, shelter-in-place order given. that, time also factor.


I expert, imagine hard measure length immunity virus hasnt even existed full year. Anyone starts post you’re cute reddit form blanket dismissal someone listened to.  claim assumptions views wrong made check post history. Guess posts /r/CoronavirusCirclejerk... customer. Scary part company one contractors working hospital covid patients. Well November 2nd competent leadership. Facebook? I'm skeptical end crisis couple weeks definitely going improve things. Thing anti covid measures also reduce flu viral infections might even result overall less deaths (in countries something) Don’t forget mostly deaths occured inside hospitals. Covid passed flu LONG time ago, well 1m deaths  Yeah, wrote phone quickly. got it. Made couple edits. they're Americans, they're always right, dare compare China? They're willing wear mask they're China that's mask can't suppress freedom. /s there's nobody left kill, entire country wasteland now. /s isn’t lol, look ingredients like know this???? end day weight gain cal vs out. fat eat much simple.  Well, eased lockdown may 11th France seems okay atm Oh, misread I'm sorry. 

Still, see similarities usernames... Dude even big deal compared fucking this. Holy shit, plastered everywhere getting news coverage? hosted massive superspreader event two days ago. Look crowd, nobody wearing mask. Look many people would vulnerable severe infection. Someone literally die almost drives buts people talking herd immunity. 60% population shit ton people infected, 1% 60% likely dead.... also shit ton people dead. hell wrong people? Everyone ""okay"" couple million people dead end this. LMAO

""Kids get sick I'm scared teenagers.""

Ok, boomer. know people wear yet see store post anything saying acceptable. Ultimately still serves purpose preventing forward propulsion exhaled aerosols. yet, MANY people, like mother, suffer things like lung cancer, get treatment could ever need, including experimental therapies targeted radiation, ZERO cost her...while USA would already millions debt care received

uh huh...it's heads, we're really covered...okay countries open. Including ones opening soon going responsible letting us in. instance countries test coming make quarantine get results back. Maybe typo number actually 9000 new deaths? thanks america. Whether relate post think r/iamverysmart fodder also intelligence test. I'd say prison affects health everyday... (You never know going die there.) Judging case numbers probably make difference good see church value members values weekly offerings. much harder estimate lockdown, usually good estimate taking averages period, lockdown can't really look HIV jokes aside, don’t think Mexico want right now, they’re bad COVID crisis well, bad gang violence places. Canada though, sounds mighty tempting.... imagine believing virus would magically 2 weeks people wore masks.

I mean CEO Salesforce? Really? Well, prereq course nursing degree wouldn’t call degree rip-off, class completely agree one thing, similar current diseases like Measles really punishes medical reasons can't vaccinated certain % vaccines minority protected rest. punish vulnerable along idiots Thank you. There's doubt US done terrible job managing pandemic, nothing response OP. Naturally though, everybody jumps immediately political corners claws come out. reply people wait 2 weeks infections chaos (deaths/ICUs etc) Let present perfect moving goalpost straw man. Nice work  Wait till Winter. 200k new cases day minimum talking random population testing done New York.? time virus active spreading parts world, elimination remotely possible country prepared shut entire planet.
For countries Australia New Zealand heavily dependent tourism, elimination seems unlikely me.
As nation immigrants, thought able travel overseas see family, without quarantine (and cover cost) returning home, great either. Headline say ""Truth spitting sane man thrown press conference.!"" Everyone reacting way. public need Truth, needs facts needs leadership governor. Damn straight calling shame Desantis. I'm US people live love. worry every day roll dice get sick they'll end dead physically, mentally financially fucked life. Masks need mandatory, Social Distancing needs encouraged. Vulnerable people need shielded state telling businesses ""If staff job home, Send home. Otherwise risk costly pentalties!"" Something like 60% americans can't afford $400 emergency go guess helps keep mask wearing up. Anti bodies necessarily reliable, vaccine trials 4x anti body production actually virus. 

They also many questions anti bodies may stay around forever may still able get sick it. 

This excludes fact people say ""I'm pretty sure already it. I'm gonna wear mask."" 

I think main reasons discussion easier everyone wears mask reduces social stigma, know true value longevity antibodies. lmao dude acting like apply job get it

it's hard enough get job *in one's city*, let alone another country, let alone another country citizenship/residence/visa for. really went ""liberty death"" ""liberty death"" we? Nah man, millennial here.

The country I'm tiny also COVID19 free. citizens residents want people coming country dealt global pandemic kill friends, neighbors, loved ones see pretty beaches complaining wear masks everywhere.

And worth, that's first world feels US right that's perfectly reasonable.

Most countries dealt head-on citizens sacrificed greater good shit getting better. US result dumpster fire one wants part it. Water? mean like toilet? literally advocate virus sick fuck spirit crushed tbh. Nihilism. 29 cases reported region Stockholm last 24 hours. 3,4% positivity rate 81801 tests last week Sweden total. I’ll close eyes hope sustain maybe, maybe, lower even more. ""an annoyance Karens."" know, kinda makes think asshole principle- “if run asshole morning, met asshole, run assholes day, you’re asshole.”

You’ve entire college education never met professor positive impact you? mask mandate. enforce rather strictly. stop spread locally. past week two mainland fuckers started flying 1500+ day. we're getting 20-40 cases every day

Edit - read second half post commented yeah that's likely happened disagree. Even though T-cells *may* bolster resistance part greater whole Ab aspect much part immune response, proven disappear time study. Even *if* T-cell response proves effective, total response severely diminshed. although headline cover complete extent situation, also say response disappears *completely*. still headline all.

By definition clickbait doubt able find news articles covering simplest situations clickbait. Curious, sweden schools ninth grade stayed open, teachers also infected level national average. People always saying ""just wait two weeks"" death cases ICU cases explode Sweden mentioned, takes two weeks people get really sjuk CDC specifically recommends getting flu vaccine August, since loses effectiveness time. recommend Sept-October. I’ll go CDC recommendation internet stranger’s reddit comment. ""We"" South. Northeast, people following guidelines fat unhealthy people South.

Not smug either, stating facts... probably won’t last pandemic endure either. Buckle up. Oh foolish antibodies work like 3 months constant argument ""wait 2 weeks"" ""lagging deaths catch up"". sorts metric compare us rest world.. 

None indicate even mediocre job actively pushed impeachment it’s way Republican Party survives Trump joke.  end Trump greatest thing happened Democrats long time. live DC almost nobody wearing masks. I've asked say stuff like ""it's uncomfortable"" ""the virus hurt young"" ""you can't catch outside"" i'll sell mine sham marriage. bidding starts at... whatever hell cost good lawyer guess Awwwwwyiss! Really? bored. miss people. Back mars people kept chanting sweden would dead people streets ""2 weeks"". never happened kept saying ""2 weeks"" May. understand TB works. vaccine - perfect others development. widely understood kill lot people Africa Asia, common problem Europe North America.

The curve flattened - look numbers. flattened California, flattened Texas, flattened Florida.

Look graphs second. Look one graphs 'daily new cases'. look like fucking flattened curve you? wish could upvote twice least consumers would think critically minute meat comes from. think people know care, I'm experience majority people eat meat idea bad industry refuse think makes uncomfy. time blonde jokes... /r/GiantMeteor2020 fuck you, that's why. America fucking shithole. Yeah, even reached year diseases spread robots. That's going wild. ...why make remember show thread feeling like 300m us petri dish knows widespread damage be...and learn ways life petri dished. :( “They done ‘X’ worse everyone else TOTAL!....except handful relatively densely populated large countries maybe countries didn’t record properly”. Doesn’t matter agree trends, person right selective.

Trump would practice conceding defeat! Why? curves point right direction. attitude like see! Doesn’t violate right self-incrimination? Doesn’t seem like constitutional. deaths! 

Winning? Must gotten science. walked operating room wearing face shield, I'd get kicked immediately room would considered contaminated. Unless one's nose mouth covered, spreading particles. could...but Americans would WILLING listen...never gonna happen dense wrapped ' know better everything ' can't accept facts contradict beliefs? ego fragile? wake every day goal make fool yourself? 

Let give hint genius: spreads:
Similarities
Both COVID-19 flu spread person-to-person, people close contact one another (within 6 feet).
Both spread mainly droplets made people illness (COVID-19 flu) cough, sneeze, talk.
These droplets land mouths noses people nearby possibly inhaled lungs.
It may possible person get infected physical human contact (e.g. shaking hands) touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes.
Both flu virus SARS-CoV-2 may spread others people begin showing symptoms, mild symptoms never developed symptoms (asymptomatic). fail believe communities help them. People want schools open either, they're scared children! President made clear “unites” certainly Canada. country, leadership right protect Canadian citizens exterior threats including Americans entering bringing infections it’s running rampant U.S. due poor measures. take precautions soil keep virus check without adding risk. contrary opinion online courses actually bad. problem we're facing 2020 that, even mere existence middle-class job market doubt, people disengaging focusing things. Distance education ""is failing"" American kids suddenly aware elites (a) give shit us, (b) running nation entire world cliff. Zoomers jaded (and rightly so) 15; took us Millennials bit longer.

Hard care conjugating French verbs odds getting job able afford trips France low.

I've said ""ghetto"" high schools. schools usually fine. teachers mix find anywhere: excellent, professional paycheck collectors, well-intended capable overburdened. problem low income students stupid; aren't. problem they're well aware jobs opportunities realistically available them, rationally disengage. would actually bet us seeing minor reduction deaths next 5 years. Idk anyone else, bought shit since high school latest. honest.  don’t know vote moving forward.  see ads politicians around here.  It’s basically bunch people saying good Trump reiterating ideals.  can’t vote either.  

In general don’t believe Democratic ideals wish 3rd party candidate worthy. Unfortunately bigger problem don’t trust politician think corrupt. 
We need term limits sweeping reform politicians incentivized vote particular cause. isn’t correlation.

It’s dog whistle racists. hear cheesy gravy fries, too. Lets get liberating, Canada. USA first, rest world second

winning! only... written response people unrealistic expectations. Also, years later Spanish flu pandemic, anti-mask protests like now. beautiful man Ted Cruz get ugly wife? hate medicine become politicized. kids learn educated! 
/s I’m definitely feeling negative feelings (sadness mostly) going back 18 days. know students need ever precautions I’m taking going benefit students. 

Most likely kids bring home them. I’m wrapping head around reality. I’m Florida wish would push schooling back month two get better handle things. This. current job plans continue reduced workforce/work home setup least rest year. think people realizing nothing going change while. didnt??
Oh thot said killed people, assumed talking trump....i mean even see blame everything broad daylight days. Same.

And pour roundup soil good measure. I'm beginning think governors Texas Florida bet going see reach 20K cases per day first. harder everybody way used it. automatically mean bad. stop going anywhere years bro. Super easy.

Love seeing anti social loners talk easy nothing. Even could leave shithole, certainly can’t now. sorry. think guys must going (can't even imagine!) every day. wish could help more.  Definitely 99% people followed social distaning, mask wearing etc, trying reopen businesses go work feed families. Definitely hope too. way things Coronavirus right now, really look likely anytime soon. Especially since money. think scholarships got anything now. could flush floater. That's would do. Instead seems dropped deuce bucket continue stare it. Florida's approach ""all guns blazing"", hate think lackluster would like. Naturally, expect Republican Governor use gun reference dealing pandemic. issue mask mandate like every sensible country / US state done? go fuck arrest lockdown mask orders unconstitutional General welfare Constitution one thread deaths still seem staying relative incredible number cases. course every death tragedy considering unnecessary point we’d handled better. I’m curious people don’t die, percentage experiencing long-lasting effects, permanent effects, serious side effects? I’d like know because, ok, get probably won’t die, could, odds it. odds lungs gonna fucked? I’m gonna blood clots various places? feel tired shitty months months? sure anyone knows saying head at.

Edit: downvotes asking questions? denying things exist? Flossing over. Made laugh. Reminds can't wait able go dentist someday. divested money policing put education would help society way around. value children. Gotta get guns Pirates Buzz Lightyear blazing, hands tied That's crazy. twelve? ure invited cake day party! Yes, said, put higher quality requirements place requested people received positive results certain period go redo test. 

The current requirements are:

The tests available usually measure IgG, sometimes combination IgM / IgA. high demands need placed specificity test order give false positive result individual level. performance recommended Swedish Public Health Agency includes positive predictive 90 percent, ≥ 90 percent sensitivity ≥ 99.5 percent specificity. Tests lower specificity proposed used prevalence group regionally higher 10 percent. - person positive TTI amazingly reluctant get tested. surprised. College one magical times life saying losing life? Fuck shit, miss college much, life easily worse wish nightmare current students. measure, discredit discredit Fauci. nothing IQ Test American People. Maybe let 11 counties secede. invest early kid. stocks etc. top you. Unless advanced degree good luck getting work visa/immigrating anyplace would actually want live. future save 1918 wave, 2020 staircase use analogy warn stupidity.

In 2020, waves remind us go beach soon. Cardenas Supermarket Oakland infected workers, Berkeley Bowl - latter serves white affluent clientele. Two McDonald’s Downtown/Temescal also got it. 

Oakland’s cases mostly Fruitvale San Leandro. recent cdc results show death rates actually 0.26 percent. fact, take account infection rates inflating deflation death toll, percentage much much lower. knew. Im sure looked passed mass media numbers looked peer reviewed studies like ""Infection fatality rates ranged 0.02% 0.86% (median 0.26%) corrected values ranged 0.02% 0.78% (median 0.25%)"" rates common flu 0.305 students, unless professor/school/coordinator utterly failed create reasonable online course. 

I've taken bunch online classes last years, vary wildly quality. school actively created full online degree program pre-COVID. Simply put, professors incapable providing good learning environment online. rush convert everything online-format last minute going exacerbate problem. That's aleady guarantee @ 3.0M+ cases.  We're moving busy Melbourne regional City prepare eventuality. many things West could learn Asia.

Plus couple acres bush &amp; slower life sounds sustainable &amp; saner us can't. Trump kept world build wall. Except ended walled in. Well drove bus right oncoming traffic... Many us done. terrible thing do. ""We find always better fire people friday. Studies statistically shown there's less chance incident end week."" $120k isn’t even enough pay one patient’s hospital bill! Like real, walked gym city (which can't still closed even though 0 cases days I'm US) anyone wearing mask - I'd leave contact complain.

Like O.o need certain parts media stop pitting citizens citizens. feel like Fox News right wing radio grew conscience, crap would fade away. Unfortunately there's chance happening since hate product make money. Sounds like punishing people public health. Got power make bastards pay now, dontcha, highness? show 'em who's boss. Shut businesses imprison homes get foreclosed on. keep right destroying average people's lives. Everything fine.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* want corona south beach diet? CDC unsure catching Covid twice, although people claimed caught once. shoot next hurricane comes. love Totally agree.

Taken completely context. Also propaganda. Downvoted. Mr. Gloom Doom spread Trump propaganda everything amazing. really can’t comment effectiveness contact tracing apps, even though one downloaded phone, that’s one way it. It’s basically impossible convince even tiniest segment Americans download it, KNOW, one method. reason it’s effective live small population (not even population LA) required show entering (probably all) places. way effectively trace people, logistically it’s going work, agree you. 

My initial comment basically theorizing, completely understanding measures would definitely ineffective US due size population, inevitable pushback population (see: dispute wearing masks), must huge constitutional element I’m paying enough attention (also, whole heap issues surrounding state federal government powers can’t even begin articulate).

I definitely reaching (again, everything I’m saying totally wholly theorizing) human contact tracers could generate short-term jobs, obviously expense government see whole host issues related one. Jesus fucking christ... like *whats absolute dumbest thing do? Yeah let's that!* “USA” cohesive response, that’s problem. States left make plans weren’t even adequately supplied. congress squabbled rather prepare us economic blow that’s still come. It’s criminal negligence federal level. I'll check well, thanks stranger Big mad lads least. Yes, international student, leave country - classes became online.   I'm trying likewise, tbt. grew different state then. really was.

For $200,000 year. Like penny pinching get lesser quality things kids. live childhood did. 

And I've told partner never reach mark even 175,000 i'm any. ruled cant commander convention center, right still it. place wants free game start, make masks mandatory public: everywhere, time. home car, wear mask. Fines double every repeat offense might help, rescinding person's driver's license would effective. Ground 3 days first offense, doubling time repeat offense. Impound car week driving grounded, double repeat offense. consequences mandatory, zero tolerance. 

I quite sure would bring infection rates entire country. Yes, we'd appropriate stadiums, mall parking lots, empty lots score every city large town park impounded cars first. month people losing driving privileges, sight maskless scofflaws would rare. hope die out. hope! get kind acid sprayer spray faces aggressive idiots without masks. they'll finally medical excuse. Well, tell alone frustration. Many people are. Maybe thing, situation impacts everyone differently.

You probably want hear anything else this, wearing mask tune constant talk they're aimed you...they're aimed way many people wearing them. part many people aren't. Okay that's masks.

Hey ever need talk someone feel free message me. sounds like pretty frustrated stuff right I'm sure would suck dealing vent, case outlet before, now.

Good luck hope go hours without hearing masks! :) Ya kinda economy worry economy Best decision ever Statistically that's impossible, unfortunately Dr Fauci needs stop trying become celebrity problems. try actually listening dad. might learn something.

Why hard realize you’re lied to? mean, it’s like they’ve lied us countless times right? cannot fucking relate 52 new cases.

What's competent government like? don’t quite understand point. quote simply illustrates N95 masks superior already established. fact remains however cotton mask still effective reducing transmission mask original question regarding. Sorry disagrees opinions masks it’s inconvenient truth. whole state poorly fyi lol  often get publicly shamed idiots? one Weld County wears mask. walk department store North right now, single mask. includes employees. happen Weld County wearing mask, people look disdain. It’s obvious believe whole thing hoax infection numbers prove that. Sad part number elderly I’ve seen without mask casually getting within six feet others. don’t know District 6 upcoming school year Weld hot zone right now. Best luck anyone visiting. don’t know man. One friends stayed he’s living pretty damn cool life. works 7 months year, he’s shit am.

House, kids, started business. wear three mask virtue signal louder rest mask wearing friends. hate era administration... really unbelievable situation. knew movie Idiocracy would come pass point, fast. Imagine entitled assault humans job, ugh Wow. can't seriously equating national academic standardized testing biological testing virus. matter size population density is. national testing make sure results centralized tracking implemented. I'll use germany example exactly doing. app people downloaded. runs google apple exposure framework 100% designed around privacy. everytime someone tested goes national health authority. person positive NA gives user number allows users decide release anonymous info phone people might exposed them. anonymous person gets notified exposed quarantine. people follow rules system hot spots contained life go on. Genius move Trump... America's high education system corrupt high education system developed world absurdly expensive.

Like everything else America. Obviously third. /s world US = 😆😆😆

let bodies hit floor! let bodies hit floor! China can’t get thing control none us can. That’s crazy anyone would invest heavily oil nowadays even pandemic Lots people wearing masks SWFL. Death confers absolute immunity. Except masks, masks still aren’t needed... guns blazing! like diabetic injecting public: fuck ‘em, it’s health. would love see happening. Oh boy, imagine could get large groups Trump rallies. 

Oh wait, forgot Trump misinterpreted truck driver protest supporters. I'm sure Trump's delusional mind would treat like protestors praising him. I’m going trust doctors scientists however found buddy’s grandma’s reported death cause vs “real” death cause. actually happened, reported as, might well different you’re guessing told. confused thinking live Orange County, Florida!? severe pandemic 20 years OH GOD THATS CRAZY North Point pretty big deal. Like half people work go there. think, anything, churches might follow example. mean, way true school since March, factor spreading it. Now, factor, major factor. senile nutcase get President?

American commentary seems think problem Australia sack Prime Minister - that's employee performing, surely? done quite lit last ten years - result crisis right PM job. Agreed spelled Our... Good point, update comment. year? No. even close.

In total; that's simply fact. flu killed hundreds millions course history. allowed, unless they're BLM protest. Sorry yeah need correct that, still 100x amount deaths though may chance vote anyway. death registered Monday actually happened Thursday last week, probably reason.  transfer supplies seems like possible point contact infection, perhaps someone lied quarantine coupled false negative test, worrying, virus lie dormant infected individuals levels don’t detect current testing NYC usually lot outdoor concerts / festivals summer Recovery business vaccine. requires people returning normal behavior- something happen right vaccine. There's ton people work many still facing financial hardships. going back normal right vaccine.

There's economic recovery, pandemic. country story about, mind sharing? idea type test did? tight, enclosed space like airplane amount social distancing mask use going make much difference. contaminated aerosols going quickly fill cabin way ventilation system dissipate them.

Sweden never full lockdown, take measures. E.g. 50 people crowds, ban visitors elderly homes, closed secondary school, distance learning universities, bar/restaurants regulations, easier stay home sick. Recommendations stay home symptoms, work home, unnecessary travels, social distancing, etc. Recommendations elderly 70+ people. Hospital beds ICU beds never run out, think always like 20% free ICU beds.

I'm sure possible compare US right know little. Swedish people better shape (e.g obesity), single households, trust government follow recommendations, different covid strains maybe., 


Edit: nordic countries really uses mask. need vent. I've mentioned husband works school district (NJ). going work since end June slowly, surely everyone stopped wearing masks. custodians, department works for, administration. one still wears one treated like outcast. also take breaks anymore pack tiny room. 

I've told would report district wants to, believes come really singled instance. best keep away people. becoming increasingly depressed angry. 

I know. want open schools, employees shrugging off. mention secretary came two days exposed 4th BBQ. mind-blowing point.

The guy wrote doctor 3 years Ah yes Chernobyl vaccine. I’ll wait Oxford that’s option. school says they’ll require vaccine available really don’t want one ngl Much better deporting students take classes online. saying period time. 

No, I'm saying opposite. misunderstood said before, apparently, repeated above. I'll say clearly.

We keep social distancing long need so, takes recognition humans places it, we.  people think can't aware rest world think US country show empathy shame someone accepting social distancing go forever even long periods time without sacrificing huge number (typical) people's mental health

Nice try.  go indefinitely without sacrificing anything.  Humans adaptable, people seem want come ""sciency"" reasons can't adapt. valid reasons that, humans adaptable species common sub still shocks every time.

You're poor drama queen. True. also look states infection rates, responses individually instead nationally. Several states well. protest actually blamed shamed, however, nought. point hes making fid far far less swine flu. they're looking wrong, college accredited degrees certification. learning actually free :-) cases people shown naturally immune virus? Looks like trying find reason advertise obscure study that's getting much traction 

Reddit's free advertising! post barely related comment get free advertising study says everyone already knows! Woot woot! 

Bonus points calling complete stranger racist -- someone never met know nothing -- beyond​ support separation church state, which, IIRC, exactly Constitution states!

Why US Constitution?

I'm supporting separation church state, calling racist that?

Sounds like matter say, looking reason call someone racist hopefully get free advertising study. Fair point rofl matter government website says, bet true right ""Probably"" cut it. Source claims Yup. organize strike, lose benefits. miserable people lol Karen accept this, kinda natural oil Keeping distance means keep distance all. practice inapporpriately triaging elderly cleraly shown numbers. compare Intensivvårdade Avlidna chart: think appropriate say elders survive care, many doctors including one Sweden's prominent geriatrics doctors disagree think many elders would survive given care. Edmonton-dweller here. 7 yr old Honda civic never died despite plugged in. baby served well years shit rolls downhill smell it. 

In case, shit's carried back homes. may catch shit mouth nose. well said! go outside sub, nobody US takes seriously...  shouldn’t socially distance obviously sick people anyone masks never seen alternative social distancing. ""The board’s “recommendations binding,” superintendent added.""

So board punted others decide. Political move. Report county? Canadian I've said many times... whole, like states touch. I'm surprised mask wearing considered medical advice. 

It absolutely is, treating such. finally got this. I'm frustrated government website saying things like ""you MAY responsible bill."" Give us definitives, please. think US lockdowns became necessary due inaction - however, several countries able control spread without lockdowns. Ah yes, well researched ""yeet"" approach hard drink coffee without mask... inside outside gate... “hOaxHIO” Wearing mask really protect you, protects people getting it, right? people already it, wearing mask mostly pointless itself. 

The important part wearing mask everybody else wears one, means peer pressure. 

So that's i'm gonna keep wearing mask...it's important everybody does, limit spread, people gotten yet. Wuhan: 50,000 cases, lost. Maybe seaborne. thats bc wear masks social distance. orgys wait. going third sentence lmao doesn't, fucking ted cruz. He's never relatable anyone, ever.

It’s almost like nepotism. Without frats/clubs hiring decades know club playing field even. sounds like via article took every precaution available avail. field, mind? Academia? one lucky (and driven, I'm sure) few.

There's doubt make living anything, question gives best chance. Picking field vast majority wash somewhere unrelated is, fact, bad idea. facts support belief. 

Certainly *some* cases transmission traced protests, actually cumulative effect protest areas shown *drop* transmission people areas stayed home less interactions (shopping, resturaunts, socializing, etc). Perfect excuse take year off. many people need touch something ""wet paint” sign someone says stove hot. can’t help themselves. 

I suspect America adopt masks lot faster next pandemic, like SE Asia learned previous outbreaks. worked... Define normality? Outdoor dining? mean there's really nothing else that's normal NYC right now. gather people large groups middle escalating pandemic. Clearly. Amen, cut Idaho rest country. TBH travel ban, interstate travel except essentials. Cool. Thanks that. 

I know lightning statistics looked up.

Regulators know complete certainty headed toward herd immunity MUCH faster vaccine ever come, telling people would either a) make panic b) make opposite, take devil-may-care approach would cause happen quickly overcrowd hospitals. 

Everyone two brain cells rub together fully aware NYC cases plummeted magic behavioral policy change, herd immunity. Current epicenters like Florida, Texas, Arizona soon follow, regulators health experts much harder time selling narrative “it’s they’re good mask wearers social distancers there!” you’d better believe they’ll try. It’s also they’ve stopped publishing recent antibody reports: it’s beneficial alert society progress toward herd immunity. Already received 2 alerts like that, live Houston Orange county conservative county part California.

Until recently, spot red sea blue. beginning change last Congressional election. But, clearly, change reached local elections. Sending back virus exist moronic, that's I'm insisting send back virus exist.

Conservative bullshit finest. Blatant doublespeak. There's also virtually nothing right now. Hard times ahead NYC tourist industry collapsed. No, want nonsense non-scientific beliefs go unchallenged internet. Especially beliefs may influence people behave irresponsibly put lives risk.

This kind embarrassing you. even read posted it? course similarities influenza SARS-CoV-2, they're respiratory illnesses. duration asymptotic transmission period, duration illness associated infectivity, number completely asymptomatic cases, fact SARS-CoV-2 inherently contagious, SARS-CoV-2 super spreading events mention emerging evidence aerosolised spread SARS-CoV-2 much less common influenza. enough disparity 2 viruses, seasonal influenza vaccines result degree herd immunity within population therefore spread slower less extensive would lessen impact interventions like mask wearing.

What nail-biter article! feel like information. confusing information. yep, among things Welcome America voted for. Letting Covid run decimate northeast 10's thousands deaths there's left infect really strategy I'd brag about. Dunno NYC yesterday, everyone eating outside masks, social distancing, etc This. go Mexico week. mask social distancing really done. People blast USA time, take granted. Mexico simply disappear never found again. Atleast America there’s chance you’ll found call 911 help get bind. Probably biggest thing took granted infrastructure. worst road United States, probably one better ones Mexico. taught social interaction. watch YouTube pirate videos stuff that’s behind paywall. it’s really piece paper I’m paying please say stop jerking academia like it’s Arron sorkin show. Colleges want money less value customer, don’t call us students. flew American Airlines weeks ago, started selling middle seat again. route I've flown probably 5 times before. flights big jets two seats - three seats - two seats. time used small connector plane.

Oh mask, signs saying let without one...the lady front let without one. also signs saying please respect passengers medical conditions allow wear masks. Essentially saying please make scene dumbass decides want wear mask.

Yeah I'm flying quite definitely American Airlines. Right?! part makes fucking furious.

""Staaates what's best them, folks"" ""the U.S. government shipping coordinator, states responsible getting PeeePeeeEeee folks"". turned ""WE got get country open folks, want look incompetent I'm going say everything fine"" ""If states open schools, I'm going take away funding (that really much control I'm mainly bluffing) I'm I'm going send illegals back came folks"". 🙄🙄🙄 Shit like gives anxiety... vaccine thoroughly tested works would certainly better would provide antibodies non-harmful non-contagious way. immune system equipped deal it, way vaccine works equips immune system properly, using immune system.

Immunity mean permanent, never part definition. feel like they’re told they’re wrong stronger believe anyways. They’re making victim martyr belief speak. 2 days deaths great news 2 days new cases would best. 

When deaths, means better treatments people Covid. 

No new cases means actually stopped spread start managing isolating new cases. 

But everything New York absolutely work. look countries Covid control see well works.  Teachers TX lose benefits unionize go strike. Even political reasons you’d expect average leader TV saying, “we’re ramping production X, since production would take long”, “masks bad first place”. That's relief, thank much taking every precaution possible protect risky places small towns tourist places two reasons (1) locals give fuck &amp; (2) tourists give fuck. Fortunately, fall either two categories.

I agree more. I'm caregiver cancer-survivor mother &amp; stage 3 COPD father (who needs double-lung transplant), imagine 2 groups people made life very, scary &amp; stressful husband &amp; I. think great guys fall categories.

I'll read edit &amp; reply thorough response get bit time, thank reply! think good discussions interstate travel sub particular, &amp; whether ways remove risk everyone. lasts. virus around since 2019 literally hasn’t single documented case re-infection. You’d insane think immunity doesn’t last least 6 months based alone.   China, infected numbers magically stopped 83k. Enough, time prioritize whats allowed open. Disney world fun, awhile. went kid, cool. assume us like wait year. However disney open hot spot schools ahve stay closed. Others people hobbies like gym others also suffer. Dont tell going disney world better tradeoff terms risk able go gym year. Idk, parents took kids parties try get infected chicken tested negative, went see, caught virus 57 days later? Sounds like one false negatives asymptomatic spread sea.  Interesting Again, that's high end estimated deaths Spanish flu (estimate 17-50 million), whereas 576,432 current confirmed. estimated way higher. currently 30-87x amount deaths. Plant based *anything* medicine means it’s likely genetically modified

Source: worked plant molecular biology lab

I don’t know exactly virus works article didn’t get specifics “plant based,” *active agent* “plant based,” it’s doubt “genetically modified.”

I don’t actually care that, anyone similar experience would surprised that, I’m sure anti GMO mob find refuse take it. 

But hey least vegans happy ... find plants mistreated lab setting. Shhhh don’t tell vegans 100k soon according Fauci... reports multiple countries primary schools increase spread, sure fits conversation thread well? Kids still kept home symptomatic (and kids symptomatic lot time experience this). would need mask properly social distance? Let's keep ...I've seen many tourists lately w low mask usage. this. blows mind people retaliate stuff like “well it’s barely killed flu does!” such. 

Like, think that. It’s lethal worst flu strain decades EVEN entire world changed fight it. It’s ridiculous people naive  Natural immunity comes body experiences virus decease creates antibodies it, vaccine immunity comes weak dead version virus put body couple harmless chemicals make sure 0 cabapility spread get strenght back, leads white blood cells learning able create antibodies creates almost perfect immunity week That's assuming people agree conclusion come to.  throw English Channel, arseholes. helps, one roommates Covid, isolated basement, neither 2 roommates caught it. I’m sure spread air conditioning, easily whole house would’ve infected sure. bring 1 family may 67 yokel family members they’d try bring states. would chaotic. 

Chain migration, folks. America sends people, sending best. Federal Government (or was) threatening pull public school funding schools plan fully reopen (thankfully every school district complying). phase 3 poised enter phase 4 July 20 States rolling back phases. fuck about?

We also hitting marks densely populated populated cities country. Good. say something people bring nonsense table. Don’t keep mouth shut subject. really insane. elephant room affordable vaccines treatments be. Austria - smack dab middle EU China's vaccine completed. state-owned enterprises China begun notifying employees vaccinated voluntarily.

I know announced. may make final confirmation international medical community. 30% got it, death rate way lower many Western European countries shut UK, Spain, Belgium, Italy. Nonono... woke. 

It fault russian lizard agents paid chinese goverment cyborg pretends bill gates microchiped people control via 5g get Adrenochrom pizza connection gain control flat earth install new world order. sure seen youtube video (which posted antivaxx fb group) person never heard evidence credibility claims hide it. article indicated, 130,000 people died COVID-19 total could grow 200,000 fall. numbers big, they’re hard grasp - really liked examples provided within article gives us better way visualizing understanding impact. example...

Michigan Stadium Ann Arbor largest football stadium United States. holds 107,420 people, football stadium country large enough hold everyone died COVID-19 thus far. Try visualize that, frightening.

Furthermore, many cities population less 200,000 - imagine entire city wiped fall.

And today, short months, COVID-19 ranks sixth leading cause death United States. 

The next time anyone votes, thinking things politicians handled crisis. could much better everyone zero excuse America going best prepared nation world handling pandemic worst actually it.  Truth Who's crying? option work, obligation. says lot come place society look teachers babysitters. Get shit sorted OC GOP hostpot CA. make temporary exception like lot countries did? Land Many Terrible Restaurants. 😆 Agree. Lol. Canada said stay fuck out. generalize us utter stupidity few. majority us America reading article thinking WTF? situation absolutely affected desire church. pastor said 1% percent die would fine 99%. mention long term health stuff. Many people know church anti mask still think it’s flu. closest friends think overreacting. last week “encouraged” masks, to. 

Our family attended person since March.. Give 10yrs, might able get job Canada treating/assisting/deprogramming American escapees. Presumably they'll escape Mexico, contact Canadian embassy exfiltrated great North. Lol, fucking argument simple. people make excuses shit politicians? Also bet dump net worth stocks classified briefing like certain politician did. Nuke site orbit, way sure Who's saying masks alternative social distancing? Mask up, stay clean mindful. rest ridicule hospital bed grave. thoughts exactly. don’t much clue end day. I’m blaming anyone, I’d hate decision making position right now. Bless scientists trying best. make sure remind us long takes get results Here's less likely spread virus also become less sick adults.

You're lying forgetting read. know someone flew sitting near duty flight attendant wearing mask. friend asked it, said ""I'M EATING"" pulled single grape. reddit moment study. clear discussing churches frame white churches completely ignored civil rights progress black churches. attacking minority institution. Yes position racist published earlier, nice! Thanks! Makes sense biologically: body time develop antibodies viral load minuscule first &amp; takes reproduce. means masks make difference even get sick! Antibody tests show 30% Sweden it. Surprisingly, seems enough cause cases plummet. unlike happened NYC... humans always one third worthless dipshits, one third competent average people trying right things, one third capable leaders performing complicated jobs creating things make life better everyone.

The dipshits used called stupid whole lives, separated 2/3, kept busy manual labor work, generally ignored enough harmless. last 40 years, bleeding hearts upended society enable people, misguided altruism, results disastrous.

This going get worse, much society longer consequences anyone, ever (unless minority course). Antisocial kids disrupt entire classrooms violent outbursts, can't removed school. Kids learning can't given failing grade, despite teachers gentle insistence need get better, see passing grade think ""fuck you, know enough"". people grow fuck society ways, ""I wrong"" attitude, enabled ridiculous ""customer always right"" policies, disrupt stores harass menial labor fuck always get want I'm always right. drive like dangerous assholes, fuck places go I'm important. spend ridiculous debt never pay for, increasing cost everything rest us. vote racist hateful policies candidates fuck group better want shit ones. vote policies would help everyone care about, they're stupid narrow minded conceive situation would benefit, focus *don't* want help, would rather spite people lives easier.

We raising third society knowledge, empathy, sense, skills, desire things, simultaneously allowing believe fine great useful deserve every luxury world over, opinions valid valid 2/3 us, actually strive understand world around improve it.

They cancer, spreading via internet. Hopefully stop showing much empathy soon, taking high road effective thus far. Maybe Brad exactly friend politics community. airline? civil summons enforceable. That’s get served owing credit card debt. money. That's problem. Education funded state local level. People stopped paying income taxes started collecting unemployment -- revenue turned expenses. People behind property taxes. Sales taxes discretionary spending people eating restaurants. Tourism stopped, one collecting 20%+ hotel taxes people pour money local economies.

States cities can't print money, options. France, less, hard lockdown : travel 100km without good reason (such work, seeing one last time dying family member...) almost like ""just flu""... I’m sure don’t remember H1N1. H1N1 still exists, better controlled flu vaccines. type influenza still circulates seasonally.

Further, big deal (including strategic school closings climb pandemic levels) working get control. But, knew fight it, strain influenza. 40% population immunity H1N1 starting gate.

It easier control H1N1 older people already many influenza antibodies impacted children - children easier contain home adults anyway.

Also, antiviral drugs work treat influenza also work H1N1.

H1N1 similar incubation period flu, 2-4 days.

SARS controlled containment. stopped spread died out. acutely severe therefore quite scary. However, easily spread wasn’t long time someone would infecting people ill. known cases spreading people already know sick. you’re advocating eugenics? Yes, technology solved knowledge accessibility problem. yet solve motivation problem. Maybe need virtual study buddies provide support family capable that? thinking exact thing looking picture. Idiots. Plain simple. fair, numbers going since mid April, many tests now. Sweden keep school open 15s? virus going circulate? No, send back, least take away access children. Thank you. I've wondered purposely giving person 2 viruses might viable alternative vaccination.

For example give someone mild virus get immune system ramped up. give low exposure covid-19 virus. saying cumulative percentage still 100? seems even weirder they’ve never negative? 💀

I thought thing. Agree. corporate America responding giving us good timeline idea much better constantly hearing media. vaccine available greatly impact economy confidence consumers companies. assume anyone posting black white thinking lack nuance intentionally seeking drive divisions America. going eat one alive. Death Santi-ing still going show source?  Ignoring summons doesn’t make go away lol nice see brits mask-morons.

i getting worried us usa while.

I still think USA outright lead race bottom here, though...  Los Angeles Houston something say this. Lol bro... said anything that? said ‘semblance normalcy.’ Keep tourists care, make city suck. yeah entertainment venues start open phase 4, July 20, suck dick.

I’m even sure point you’re trying make. civil rights progress that's related separation church state regarding social programs? rising freshman sophomore, taking gap year going community college. Bit screwed upper classman. would still like take year junior. depends whether Air Force 1 makes last-minute flight Moscow 19th not. ohhh sorry, meant CAD that's different story job make fill will? They're daycare. part issue have. make sense schools closed daycare isnt? 

I can't imagine asking another parent watch kid 7 hours per day indefinitely. like we're friends parents kids school sad part would strict masks staying home numbers would way we'd probably reopening safely. I'm saying lied American public, ain't honest.

It's easy point understand. read slowly might get flat wrong, USA 960 deaths July 9 according Stop arrogant ignorant take advice, lose snark. People certain age (even stable ones intubated) less 20% survival rate ICU care (they know kept admitting). adjusted treatments less invasive cared hospital departments (ICU care Sweden means ventilator). several cases people elderly homes reluctant refer elderly hospital care (these two systems managed different levels administration Sweden) currently investigated mishandling.

The military literally built field hospital 100 ICU respirator beds never got used (even though Sweden doubled ICU capacity close 90% usage capacity peak days). Triage supposed happen capacity started exceeded, cases taken seriously (and taken already April reports hospital Stockholm made). start dying 2 years. no.  have. stale. longer fits. kinda dumb think lol.

Fuck heard punk, constitution can't protect hearing Seriously? Noooo :( still think unbelievable me. Even worldwide shut down, death toll still spikes. Maybe better sleep homes gone. can't stand financial lockdown, world lockdown opportunity lockdown. year would year success many people. like animals zoo. think efforts paying off. 52% last count forgetting we're still AIDS pandemic killed 21st century.  Don’t listen reddit, listen Johns US highest rates testing per capita, far lower positivity rate Brazil.

33.2 compared 6.28.  underclass provide herd immunity whether want not. put ban list never allowed fly again. Rules rules... Thank you. kidding won’t absolutes. Look historical estimates you’ll usually see massive ranges (Spanish flu killing 20-50 million, etc). Victoria, Texas. Things starting get really bad too. keep track New Yorkers ones spread shit (extremely frustrating) experience. supreme self belief they’ve DoNe rEsEaRcH impenetrable.

Edit: like group says focus stem growth anti science beliefs rather try change minds diehards.  That’s probably best approach. really plays like top quality thriller, it? I’m US

Exit: Yes, say $600 per week. yes, millions people accessed chunk change. find funny companies given billions, churches even... pay salaries money could gone directly working class. middle man? revenues got cut Im assuming

States cities took ***massive*** cuts revenue. Income taxes replaced paying unemployment. People stopped paying property taxes. People buying much eating less sales tax. tourists mean less hotel tourism taxes. Businesses going bankrupt mean less corporate tax revenue. People dont care anymore. lot people tried hardest stay inside, socially distance months, virus isnt getting better, what's even point trying, leaves choice, old, high risk, stay home, ok getting It, go whatever, one cares anymore.

There government program help try beat this, people really couldnt beat it. point, I'm back normal mask, working 30+ hours week, going gym, going eat, going shopping, small parties, etc. honestly isnt going end vaccine comes out. Again, anyone saying masks alternative social distancing? 

If everyone social distance great, social distancing possible reject mask use? Hey, we're great Albany. fastest candidates right Oxford Russia.

This pandemic sure exposed U.S. first rate power everyone thought was. Shit, haha, twist link might help, there’s way deep link particular week, graph shows spike flu &amp; pneumonia argument every time someone’s says “they’re entitled opinion”. pertaining anti-vaxx train thought things denial systemic racism lack comprehension need universal healthcare. let ignorance go unfounded America sake “freedom speech”. let people differing view points matter destructive are. need attach consequences affect deniers science progress. let ignorance go unfounded consequences spread us. seen pandemic. Stupidity ignorance needs quelled humanity continue. believe study suggesting antibodies declining, might decline. also occured Spain, I'm sure London study based Spain data.

The word 'might' encompassing know yet would constitute immunity. hope T-cells help, still researched. Wow that's great. Florida 15k new cases per day think they've come close peaking use miles fly, they're eating cost. stick harder using miles making break.

Ted Cruz still destination. get detained causing disturbance. hope so. last thing need open border US right now. eight-month challenge

8 months? 

By time things hit market, I'm hoping vaccine. That’s it? already happened, cooking double normal capacity since March. Finland said there’s second wave won’t close schools. easy might feel schadenfreude South made fun us, remember lot people dying *not* people said shitty things us online, even it’s actually justice die gasping alone lack empathy. seems like actually understand anything either, provide helpful answers. would say given cognitive abilities lot anti maskers feel like would latch onto take seriously would inadvertently created another problem add list. 

For record know people refuse wear seatbelts they're people wear mask. come serious mental gymnastics both. He’s literal extremist thinks anything short Chinese Gestapo coming front door welding locks shut “not enough” see good news.

It's long wait. Right now, things control getting worse. difficult American avoid Covid several months. good. Another interesting thing note Sweden's deaths infections per day steadily dropping despite cumbersome system. 

Perhaps there's something Flatten Curve strategy, all! make vaccinations compulsory nearly anything life: public education, youth sports, college, jobs, etc. Eliminate religious exemptions allow medical exemptions. parents either vaccinate kids live batshit crazy reality grid. Governor Michigan done job well. feel safe knowing keeps science numbers  Super Bowl victories:

You’re looking stats *matter*, man. Thanks this! I’m Shanghai obviously right. joking... economy almost everyone weak survive covid19 already died? I’m 30 Got links scientific studies show kids can't vectors virus? nightmare experts saying children likely spread disease? you’re going inside somewhere public, like grocery store. 

Did miss law going effect couple weeks ago? Thank you. wish same. safe there. let's clear, maximum death toll H1N1 pretty much garbage, near high Man, that'd nice. I'm nurse US annual raise cancelled months ago. seriously think need put gates around regions country let essential workers out. would feel much better chances Northeast sectioned New York Maine. point getting virus much dangerous ineffective method ""triggering response"" immune system (which equips preventing future infections). There's data long-term organ damage survivors, hundred thousand dear, getting increases risk accidentally spreading further. 

The point vaccine quickly, harmlessly, efficiently provide protection, cases made equip immune system even better getting virus would. Hahahaha, yeaaaa right. wealthy people’s kids aren’t public school. competent response leadership? Best restrict absolute needs. I’m glad Canada strong laws it. weren’t trying make international point inclusive country is, would prolly take less actual refugees well. Can’t win every battle, guess. one said covid sunshine roses, suggest NY kind wasteland moment truly touch. extra $600 per week, per month. extra $2400 month saved many people complete financial ruin. places lose teaching licenses quitting contracted period. think enough Swedish residents write relevant authorities this, changed. Almost everyone know, maybe 10% people, including outliers, saying need wait change things gets bad. state categorized dramatically rising, control, needs take action (depending chart). need dire, irrecoverable, deaths kinds start rising state take action?? I’ve school decade. 

What part constitution understand? Please avoid quoting rage machine. Social distancing. Proper methods controlling virus. that's possible, masks. incorrect translation. know google always good swedish, believe see people swedish knowledge comment well. doesnt survive either way. know many people want punch face. Want bet this? Deaths hit record highs least three states within last week know of

California 
Florida
And 
Texas 

I believe It’s 600 week Nice, better safe sorry. safe sorry involve flying AA. 
Also flight 17 days ago think I'm good too. would said listen doctors, wear mask, etc. probably wouldn’t are

Plus, he'd surging polls. People would see right thing crisis, he'd become difficult beat reelection. instead reliably shits bed. is-- certainly want out-of-state visitors time either. Yes, now, already stated reasons.

Why fuck Germany example test much US right now? “Behind scenes processes” meaning skimming large percentage money administration bullshit jobs help one like South Florida better. businesses require masks even making people wear properly. amount people see using mask cover mouths, leaving noses completely exposed, absolutely ridiculous. Cashapp instead. buy masks distribute school. good estimations first two months pandemic. Note countries probably accounted covid deaths (Belgium, Germany), probably missed thousands (Italy, US, France) nations weren’t even close capturing real toll (Ecuador, Peru, Chile). we’ve moved pandemic poorer countries last two months suspect lot latter category nothing back up. suspect countries may many cases US, testing capability confirm it. mean, he’s wrong... but, didn’t exactly help prevent either. totally understand that. think people blame ignorant, particularly current environment weaponized politicized misinformation. thought experiment moment, imagine politicians suddenly started saying Covid caused ketchup, long stop eating ketchup fine. produce studies show this. particularly trust politicians sure think better judge what's true scientists, motivation lying obvious, would know bullshit ignore it, right? That's ignorant people feel. They've spent months/years/a lifetime hearing scientists lie tools deep state, give confusing conflicting information constantly, motivated help people take away freedoms, contradict preachers pastors politicians trust, telling ""it's flu"" bro.  underfunded public school system (or joke ""home school"" program) give tools understand works, totally reliant trusting someone tell truth. made choice, confirmation bias, group think, insures choice trust religious leaders conservative politicians scientists know-it-alls, continues seem correct. 

That woman natural predictable result allowing people monetize misinformation, piss poor education system. feel sorry her, I'll feel sorry ignorance gets killed, even though pretty obviously going kill others too. deaths continue spike. Look countries like China India contact tracing. done even face soaring infections massive numbers infected. need political will. problem things changed last 14 years. Hell, theyve changed last 3. Im saying impossible much less countries want americans right now. We're even allowed Canada right now. Really highlights difference boss leader. bosses scared shitless people ""above"" (i.e. federal government) people ""below"" (i.e. constituents). true leader, time TRUE crisis, would stand people them, inspire people them. Hmm, annoying site hasn’t updated since 07/09. guess we’ll learn today briefing. don’t know anyone living counties. know Franklin got public Health Advisory alert 3 phones telling us cases rise wear masks out. be... interesting lack better word. google translation. offers amount protection wearer.

*edited add additional example. People let flight fined well. dangerous there. Yikes! Definitely less still exist.. unlike industries. 30,000 deaths, twice many Florida, Texas, New York combined.  I'm sure I'd taking victory lap that. less likely spread virus also become less sick adults. person education extremely important childhood growth.

You claimed article shows kids *less likely spread it*. Fail. doesn't. 

Nice try. US domestic flights Delta usually best three major US carriers (I'd rank Delta United American). US airlines like Southwest Jet Blue aficionados, flown years.

In experience Delta falls behind international routes, US carriers fall behind international carriers (eg Singapore Airlines, Korean Air). sheep 

How calling people ""sheep' explode last weeks? I've heard people say mind boggling me. fair, knew 3 frat members college, 2 doctors now. really want repost correct title translation. heat kill spreading via air conditioning south. That's explanation really.

New York apocalyptic come fall Na, south spread north. take hard decision stopping Interstate travel going keep going around. obvious, unfortunately goes mighty constitution Sweden adopting contact tracing strategy 1. recommended 2. literally proven fail neighboring Denmark, country similar culturally, etc. Sweden. 

That simply quite obviously laughably bad. 

Yeah, yeah: Sweden htis feels like resources apparently. wth it? Bizarre. People dying home, alone, they're afraid go hospital expense. Then, they're found, places like Florida recording cause death something COVID. guarantee it. need fly weekly? people get back loading refrigerated trucks.

A History State Authority Restrict Travel
COVID-19 first pandemic affecting America, last. circumstances, states well-recognized authority limit travel within across borders.
Over 100 years ago, smallpox era, U.S. Supreme Court issued two decisions limiting “right” interstate travel—which, way, appear U.S. Constitution. First, 1902’s Compagnie Francaise de Navigation Vapeur v. Board Health State Louisiana, Court stated:

That early day power states enact enforce quarantine laws safety protection health inhabitants recognized Congress, beyond question. Congress exercised power subject, state quarantine laws state laws purpose preventing, eradicating, controlling spread contagious infectious diseases, repugnant Constitution United States, although operation affects interstate foreign commerce, open question.

In words, Congress (not president, cannot enact law himself) says otherwise, states may act protect citizens pandemic harms.
Likewise, 1905, in Jacobson v. Massachusetts the Supreme Court held:

Upon principle self-defense, paramount necessity, community right protect epidemic disease threatens safety members … every well-ordered society charged duty conserving safety members rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand.

Although Jacobson involved vaccinations smallpox, Court’s confirmation state enact compulsory laws regulations protect residents epidemic still good law.
Good law recently applied travel case 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote Supreme Court in Zemel v. Rusk:

The right travel within United States course also constitutionally protected … freedom mean areas ravaged flood, fire pestilence cannot quarantined demonstrated unlimited travel area would directly materially interfere safety welfare area Nation whole.

By time decision, notion restrictions interstate travel warranted circumstances secure Warren could use basis analogy international travel.
Federal Inaction Interstate Travel
Thus, following Court decisions, must ask: Congress said ability restrict interstate movement time public health threats, limit states’ authority? answer Congress, past, has delegated power to Secretary Health Human Services authorize Surgeon General make regulations

necessary prevent introduction, transmission, spread communicable diseases foreign countries States possessions, or one State possession State possession.

In response Ebola earlier threats, regulations exist. One authorizes director Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC)

determines measures taken health authorities State possession (including political subdivisions thereof) insufficient prevent spread communicable diseases State possession State possession, he/she may take measures prevent spread diseases he/she deems reasonably necessary.

Indeed, March 14, CDC issued a “No Sail” Order, renewed April 9, banning cruise ships disembarking passengers (many Americans) American port. Why? achieve the priorities of

Preservation human life; preventing introduction, transmission, spread COVID-19 throughout United States; preserving public health critical resources federal, state local governments; [and] preserving hospital, health care, emergency response resources within United States.

However, CDC director yet issued similar “No Non-Essential Travel” order, would restrict interstate travel essential commercial health needs.
The Important Role Travel Restrictions
In likely event allowed so, important remember happened Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918. Locations lifted social distancing mandates early experienced a second surge deaths. Moreover, currently U.S. continues shortages of personal protective equipment, testing kits, essential equipment needed anyone safely say someone coming – example – large cities smaller cities towns, far less health care resources, increasing risks Supreme Court CDC said legally addressed restrictions travel. experts say U.S. needs to triple current testing capacity before social distancing restrictions safely lifted.
The U.S. exceptional. April 17, have many more people – 750,000 confirmed infected coronavirus country, many Americans – over 40,000 – died it. daily totals still rising faster almost anywhere else world. COVID-19 largely spread well-meaning, asymptomatic people – including so-called super-spreaders – put innocent lives risk 50 states.
Conclusion
Now time partisan politics, among governors, Washington. state’s stay-at-home restrictions lawfully allowed continue long governor deems necessary. governors disagree state, CDC Congress mandate nation-wide protection everyone’s lives resources avoid second surge deaths, residents “lenient” states allowed travel states ongoing stay-home orders. article’s title confidently stated resistance fades. assertion isn’t supported evidence, know antibodies fade people mild infections. don’t know whether antibodies fading causes lack immunity.

That’s responses based on. There’s many sensationalist headlines, many people know better making assumptions incompatible scientific method. betting democrats Republicans die. I've got question everyone. moved I'm trying get insured, wait period seems indefinite. April, president said US government would cover coronavirus expenses uninsured. promise still stand? seen updates follow-ups this. happened grandmother couple siblings! heart surgery 36. Scary stuff! Maybe meant Oklahoma? per capita cases far highest world. 1% Americans caught Covid-19 point.

Its per capita deaths still behind hard hit European nations (UK, Italy, Spain, France, Belgium, Sweden) catching quickly unfortunately people aren’t going physically distance wear masks forever. social creatures rely lot facial expression like interact one another.

Not nature. Plenty countries societies (which studied aware of, right?) social distance matter course.

It's US that's used it, there's nothing preventing us biologically, people like there’s vaccine within like two years mass death

I'm far left, view continue encouraging widespread education (maybe cost students) abolishing exploitative economic system requires 95% people take shitty serf jobs first place.

However, looking measures lower risk people situations can't keep much distance possible cases masks recommended. true. Thanks making look adding another terror already terrorized brain! Anyone lives Southern CA calls Anaheim Angels. LA Dodgers one LA would claim Angels own. Sweet strawman don’t know person embodies “at risk” woman picture. competition stiff think DeSantis might hold belt right inept political leader (except know who). he's everything win title.  shown exist, shown permanent not. 

The fact happens means big problem going cost money, time, lost productivity deal secondary effects virus.

So dying problem, we're talking here. aged **worse** milk. came make mosquito joke. Well played. Also need compare testing rates per capita.

But nuance. don’t take kindly talk like around :s remember everyone fed bullshit /r/personalfinance went made /r/povertyfinance type financial help people actually seeking. way anyone making 40k talked like fault former sub absolutely ridiculous see throughout comments still. money makes people become giant assholes absolutely empathy even entertain thought “not everyone position”? Yes. Definitely Mickey find data shows extreme political divide got last 20 years US, Obama mandates unfortunately change anything.

Actually, since virus survives longer cold environments low humidity, there's causation. Also, low humidity dries large respiratory droplets making lighter concentrated linger air continue accumulate. Man ""the flu kills people per year"" people sure got quiet.

For numbers, 2017-2018 flu killed 79,400 people.

Corona killed 138,000 counting. We're really 5-6 months since really started ramping up. realize county went heavily Hillary 2016 right? sure GOP. work bunch colleges upstate New York, medical nursing students went New York City March April, hospitals desperate grateful extra manpower made low-risk staff stop saying it’s flu broh then? 1,000 people get struck lightning US day?

It’s economy, again. might true (it depends choose study really), different issue altogether. point trying make online classes automatically discounted worth less traditional classes. Reddit! Really, people lost fucking minds? US lost fucking cause. Also talk doctor. work education, doc recommends get undergrads return campus every fall. means mid-August me.  Oh, I've said many years people believe rights people like them. want rest us live fascist dictatorship.

Practically everything makes sense view lens. nothing dying. Young people still tiny tiny chance dying Covid. Much less 0.1% young demographics. makes sense keep ordering around. seem unable math articulate thinking. talking saving lives value life. honestly kids I'm concerned about. following data, see trouble virus. 

It's teacher faculty danger. kids going spread virus like wildfire going lose lot teachers. what? ever concert, festival, protest, populated event city? everyone stay outside streets flooded many people? 

No. streets flooded, coffee shops, bars, porta-potties, etc lining streets flooded well. 

Again, admitting conditions contributed spread doesn’t mean don’t support cause. reality contributed spread.

Wrong. highest risk spread indoor environments coronavirus likely spread ventilation systems. safe.

The best thing decide get hotel room would leave window open entire time hope best - sleep car? really think social distancing sustainable life?

Tuberculosis kills 1.5 million republican party pro COVID-19. idiots ones campaigning strict lockdowns protect vulnerable people.

Contradicting arguments what? Dude, delusional comparing Biden Trump. 

You think write candidate like Kanye gonna solve problems?

Biden isn’t first choice, neither Hillary, sure shit would either charge shitstain currently office...

Your comment makes things worse... He'll change mind point. Cases deaths eventually rise level force shut state down. 

The question many cases willing accept? many needless deaths happen choices? Philadelphia biggest protests country, virus numbers look good. also require masks everyone public. done. Russian living America, real food miss most. produce much better there, too. Rooting Singaporean authoritarianism US proves protesters right. Stabilize consistent upward trajectory... much worse situation deep outbreak. sink, longer takes bail water boat. 

I appreciate Cali this. Given sheer number Californians mobility folks, would fucked pulled Disantis. fly blue angels still better getting drafted Vietnam. Imo. still fucking sucks. American dream seems unattainable I’m better lot peers. Holy fuck. someone Canada, thought never even entered mind. makes much sense now.

I hope happen Biden president. Unfortunately due divisive partisanship across country, I’m confident they’ll cooperation various state governments. property, won’t able take loan pay it. read people going get shot wearing mask.. 
but isn’t left want masks right carries guns don’t want masks? It’s alll confusing! I'm actually required trust anything understand standard transparency trust???

I'm going church. require act faith.

And I'm accusing scientists vaccine researchers unethical. saying pharmaceutical industry unethical POTUS unethical man.

But even everyone saints, must know public entitled audits transparency, right? We're supposed subjects democracy. Democracy supposed work us.

I'm saying whistleblowers put solitary confinement less.

And say someone created vaccine strategy region increased vaccination rates. I'm saying hospital employee also immune compromised.

We NEED transparency order earn public trust order vaccine work. public access proof, trust new vaccine resulted abbreviated safety trial. drugs ordered trials completed.

These truths spin machine use see public distrust.

And safe get vaccine important get right. right. I’m Denver wife nurse, saying say need supplies anything else ‘out there’ I’ll happy deliver you. take care taken care us😊  needs redress grievance need pay this. care diet plan trying nice. Hey, please try stay safe front lines. 

I hear y'all breaking NY records, soon 1000 deaths per day coming. 

Please take care yourself. Aloha Hawaii. I'm sorry living around idiots. wrong. done nothing. no, masks, shot holes them. “Everything we’re mitigating spread. know stop spread COVID-19,” Greene said.
If someone contracts coronavirus, Greene said Department Health determine needs isolate classroom entire school needs close.



🙄🙄🙄🙄

The trump administration government retarded. leader free world said 99% infections harmless. Bigly. possible...but access best healthcare.

Maybe 340 lb guy NFL would risk? eh,

this variation whining employers somehow want employee know everything already also get barely enough pay make worth it.

Do really think enough intelligent people easily retrained job? Anecdote means nothing, life encountered many many intelligent young recent college grads working menial jobs, could easily trained something else relatively easy.. would cost employers money. Honestly, idea. Maybe they’re banking fact time get doses, we’ll 30mil already infected won’t need vax (this kind sarcasm also kind really)

Should get 300mil hard cap, might good enough herd immunity short term could secure 30 more? I’m trying discredit dire situation Florida right everything minimize chances catching spreading anyone information July 1st Florida Department Health starting combining results rapid tests lab tests individual multiple unique cases. Also information discredit people arguing one person tests positive multiple times counted unique cases test. many people life believe mostly hoax carrying like business usual Florida engage information would helpful set straight. follow aggressively, I've read countries did, think mask usage thing 3 weeks stopped, I'm sure tell you.

Edit: mention sitting absolute charlie-foxtrot. Thry got jump things, playing complrte catch-up, 94 first TV timeout. effort weaken economy Trump reelected.

They fail see Trump come strong support masks locking hard 2-3 months reopening safely, would received ton support. Check approval ratings, first stages letting Fauci speak approval best been. Crazy would stop train. understanding SCOTUS would weigh constitutionality, would take months, would obviously way way slow COVID-time. governor, including Cuomo, would challenged move, would taken long resolve many state's residents would fled panic long ruling.

It's kind sad never made kind plan deal scenario advance. Like, passed federal law 1998 declared president \*could\* cordon state event pandemic biological weapon attack, constitutionality already established, would nothing worry about. Or, maybe could passed constitutional amendment pandemic pure thought experiment, amendment understood apply specific states.

Too late now, course. think so. Studies shown invest education brings crime down. We're investing children level. reach adulthood lack support leads criminal activity lock up. let's even talk policing students inner cities. parents sister teachers South Los Angeles. could tell horror stories. suggesting ""just flu,"" say that. saying widespread mask wearing like we're seeing would prevent thousands deaths things like flu...soo..why stop virus rear view? yeah, think rhode island randomly picked new york hat said ""that one"" think possibly epicenter outbreak northeast time people new york leaving city coming rhode island quarantining problematic rhode island low numbers point governor best prevent spread.  
kind like cuomo now. picking major hot spots people quarantine enter state. It’s time start listening drunk Canadian guys pandemic advice. best suggestion I’ve seen sub’s existence. Cause expenses lol Meanwhile Denmark. one wears masks. wear mask, covid ard weirdo. much covid left here. Masks one piece puzzle. 

IMHO, state moved reopen indoor dining bars testing %positive rate dipped 1%.  rising automatically closed again. Every President destroys segment economy. Obama did. Bush did. Clinton ...

If work sector that’s reliant grants, better prepared get screwed often. *Laughs sodium content* bold strategy Cotton, let's see pays them. decades research claim lmao but...from understand- virus mostly impervious bullets. That's roll. I'll wear around chin pull pass people continue wearing couple minutes after. suggesting they'll turn around lol? Clear Creek County one. sensibly enforced. warning first offense ""up $5,000 1 year jail"" second offense.

We small fairly vulnerable population. also every single vacationer infected states. happy local government taking super seriously. Uh huh. Rust belt way urban America.   wedding. Covid-19 toll climbs, sick workers families dead face another burden: fighting benefits workers’ compensation systems that, states, stacked them.

This we're honoring ""heroes."" disgusting. Pretty sure money laundering scheme Never trusted english teachers still don’t. wanna learn English history major. agree here.

I 100% lockdowns posted fb ""buy groceries now, everything closed soon."" 

A week later Home Depot packed people ""essential"" home projects.

The lockdowns failed.

The people spoken. 

We go Sweden route whether like not. I've found articles/videos momentarily including genetic clotting disorders list risk factors increase clotting COVID-19 statements additive. they're like ""oh fine, need prophylactic blood thinners"" going hospital dying need way prophylactic. think I'm gonna listen advice. Prophylactic doses blood thinners super low risk stuff take. gonna happen libs apparently use harry potter reductionist tool. lens understand conflict harry potter. things get reduced ""X Dumbledore!"" ""Y like Umbridge!"" becomes insane shows inability grasp real world conflicts real world dynamics. thought weird thing first, leftists made decry libs, wild. time teacher's unions come together issue collective ""Nope. See Zoom."" problem is, everyone gets once, chances death rate spike, hard. Hospitals overloaded, people would survived right treatments die pointless preventable deaths. Moreover, endangering lives like completely unnecessary achieve results viable vaccine even better, altruism. Look Asian countries. already returning normal despite pandemic raging around world, yet aren’t severely affected all, thanks people don’t let freedom get heads block fact live society, isolated universe. point, way see Trump winning voter fraud. know LOT people voted saying ""to hell dingus"", including myself. dunno...I mean, saw good sneak peak back toilet paper ripped every shelf. Okay. prove worth less now?

I would assume he's worth billions stealing taxpayers 4 years Even Alabama places like Chick Fil Zaxby's stuck drive-thru only. Considering everything else opened fuck ASAP, appreciate chains now...aside CFA's right-wing BS that's another story. I've heard complaints anyone angry sticking drive-thru would imagine would perfectly fine go route Canada suffer. thing know?

Am  Hope NJ. Even though tho gov didn’t authorize indoor dining, they’re still going ahead windows open. technically airflow outside. technically it’s outdoor dining. Stupid bastards. It’s 120° kitchen want money. We’re worked death. Half staff laid yet we’re essential. overtime isn’t worth 70 hours week. People don’t wear masks. Servers don’t know ho wear masks. like matters much anyway everyone cramped line kitchen can’t one foot apart anyone given time. I’m done. die, is. Trump dragged handcuffs crimes humanity.  think referred mar-a-lag-aria you. you, terrible selfish human. happened growing turned sad, pathetic totally uncaring person? Basically someone allowed stupid assholes care anyone anything money, become people power, everyone except people power suffers consequences.

This happens democracy effectively shut propaganda anti-democratic initiatives like voter fraud lobbyism.

I hope guys turn around! locals like tour*ism*. understand living couple years, Asheville relaxed progressive community driven art, people ton freedom. could argue population less well-off financially, strived art. brought lot people around world live place paint, sculpt, make music, take pictures, exist nature like. mostly accepted regardless roots appearance. 

In lot ways still like that. That's locals nasty tourists. end day people around extremely human cruel someone elsewhere. 

But difficult ignore side-by-side shots ""90s"" Asheville current. still cool, progressive place, people progressively find harder find jobs places live. lot local artists businesses forced favor expensive vacation rentals boutiques owned people moved huge, congested cities. funding goes tourism industry anything. 

The murals art see around city dope, change lot. apparently back day entire city canvas, government folks decided tourists like that, started regulate people could put art. There's big green wall Vance monument think used freely painted local artists whoever wanted add, consistently gets painted visitors look ""eyesore"". Yet there's always ton trash around downtown cleaned drunken disorderly tourists causing disruptions.


So yeah, people city going treat badly. Especially employees, hard find job around pissing wrong tourist leave homeless. mean people come pandemic disrespectful, mean put forth effort leave less trace respectful towards city. Especially buying local art! flea markets great that. know much charge Disney Weddings? venture magical world Disney Funerals. doubt tough bars small businesses see way around quite honest seeing plenty small businesses ignoring safety guidelines particularly bars restaurants makes hard empathy them. women left picture prime candidate getting deadly case coronavirus. upper arms look thicker waist extreme obesity makes less likely survive virus consindering behaviour matter time gets it.

I'm wondering what's up. 2020 proposed budget DOD 718.3 billion. think could take 1/3 away risk getting invaded either snowmobile riding Canucks Mobile Tuck Roll wagons Mexico. liked Florida Man headlines lot better meant stupidly spreading death disease.

• someone lives house teacher tests positive? teacher need take 14 days work quarantine? time covered? Paid?

• district going find substitute teacher work classroom full exposed, possibly infected students substitute pay?

• Substitutes teach multiple schools. diagnosed COVID-19? kids school quarantine get tested? going pay that?

COVID-19 first pandemic affecting America, last. circumstances, states well-recognized authority limit travel within across borders.
Over 100 years ago, smallpox era, U.S. Supreme Court issued two decisions limiting “right” interstate travel—which, way, appear U.S. Constitution. First, 1902’s Compagnie Francaise de Navigation Vapeur v. Board Health State Louisiana, Court stated:

That early day power states enact enforce quarantine laws safety protection health inhabitants recognized Congress, beyond question. Congress exercised power subject, state quarantine laws state laws purpose preventing, eradicating, controlling spread contagious infectious diseases, repugnant Constitution United States, although operation affects interstate foreign commerce, open question.

In words, Congress (not president, cannot enact law himself) says otherwise, states may act protect citizens pandemic harms.
Likewise, 1905, in Jacobson v. Massachusetts the Supreme Court held:

Upon principle self-defense, paramount necessity, community right protect epidemic disease threatens safety members … every well-ordered society charged duty conserving safety members rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand.

Although Jacobson involved vaccinations smallpox, Court’s confirmation state enact compulsory laws regulations protect residents epidemic still good law.
Good law recently applied travel case 1965, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote Supreme Court in Zemel v. Rusk:

The right travel within United States course also constitutionally protected … freedom mean areas ravaged flood, fire pestilence cannot quarantined demonstrated unlimited travel area would directly materially interfere safety welfare area Nation whole.

By time decision, notion restrictions interstate travel warranted circumstances secure Warren could use basis analogy international travel.
Federal Inaction Interstate Travel
Thus, following Court decisions, must ask: Congress said ability restrict interstate movement time public health threats, limit states’ authority? answer Congress, past, has delegated power to Secretary Health Human Services authorize Surgeon General make regulations

necessary prevent introduction, transmission, spread communicable diseases foreign countries States possessions, or one State possession State possession.

In response Ebola earlier threats, regulations exist. One authorizes director Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC)

determines measures taken health authorities State possession (including political subdivisions thereof) insufficient prevent spread communicable diseases State possession State possession, he/she may take measures prevent spread diseases he/she deems reasonably necessary.

Indeed, March 14, CDC issued a “No Sail” Order, renewed April 9, banning cruise ships disembarking passengers (many Americans) American port. Why? achieve the priorities of

Preservation human life; preventing introduction, transmission, spread COVID-19 throughout United States; preserving public health critical resources federal, state local governments; [and] preserving hospital, health care, emergency response resources within United States.

However, CDC director yet issued similar “No Non-Essential Travel” order, would restrict interstate travel essential commercial health needs.
The Important Role Travel Restrictions
In likely event allowed so, important remember happened Spanish Flu Pandemic 1918. Locations lifted social distancing mandates early experienced a second surge deaths. Moreover, currently U.S. continues shortages of personal protective equipment, testing kits, essential equipment needed anyone safely say someone coming – example – large cities smaller cities towns, far less health care resources, increasing risks Supreme Court CDC said legally addressed restrictions travel. experts say U.S. needs to triple current testing capacity before social distancing restrictions safely lifted.
The U.S. exceptional. April 17, have many more people – 750,000 confirmed infected coronavirus country, many Americans – over 40,000 – died it. daily totals still rising faster almost anywhere else world. COVID-19 largely spread well-meaning, asymptomatic people – including so-called super-spreaders – put innocent lives risk 50 states.
Conclusion
Now time partisan politics, among governors, Washington. state’s stay-at-home restrictions lawfully allowed continue long governor deems necessary. governors disagree state, CDC Congress mandate nation-wide protection everyone’s lives resources avoid second surge deaths, residents “lenient” states allowed travel states ongoing stay-home orders. Min Orange head believers! US government admit last administration wrong, order everyone wear mask, R0 drop, hospitals start empty, people feel safe again. interesting take Swedish situation. 

No matter strategy is/was allegedly largely irrelevant Sweden's results. literally stopped logging Reddit commenting 2months this. logged back today comment unrelated topic saw replies. People simply believe say, even truth, unless evidence back story. Putting shoes, completely understand would downvote comment. Social Media cancer, Reddit. Refute ""anecdote"" want, downvote want. nothing prove phone conversation actually happened. record it, anything back story. con't care, still felt important share experience.

Whether *actually* counted numbers? zero proof that. felt sharing story important nonetheless. Disregard want.

Yes people lie internet, reason believe I'm saying true, felt important share experience appalled response received. I'm normal dude living life trying share experience others. I'm simply getting chest. Take grain salt, also put shoes moment--what gain coming back 2 months later responding? 

The thing offer assurance overheard conversation two ears would testify oath happened. That's OK, nose big virus would get lost way lungs. noble goal get people wear masks, rich CEO exaggerating effectiveness order gin excitement mask contest he's going turn profit-making enterprise need right now. still get flu vaccine every year. think I've ever caught it. .... carefully avoided saying anything giving helpful guidance *to schools supposed charge of*, parroting ""we open schools"" over.

It's like telling someone jump boiling lake lava. person screams ""YES HOW? WANT DIE!"", say ""Well, examples jumping private sector, every jump same. really important jump across lava."" miserable March April helped most.

The government shut pretty much everything one wanted go otherwise. won’t downvote you, yes criminal follow airlines regulations air. lot power want use it. ""How going afford island escape increase taxes AMIRITE!?"" ... no. Protein =/= meat. Meat made protein, meat inherently multicellular. virus isn’t even single cell. case provinces Another day, another Swedish public figure saying something stupid COVID-19 Sure does, currently downvoted people don’t get it. wanted „warn“ you. Trump tells Abbott shutdown Texas. 

FTFY Ok, expiring eviction ban? signal openness avoiding impending fiasco? Can't second wave never leave first wave i've seen proposing it, caveat scare crap everyone currently working Texas nothing like real union. power strike collectively bargain. think going end? gripping article... 💩 Shutdowns, physical distancing, competent government, populations aren’t braindead.  Wearing mask totally protects you. cuts transmission 30% person wearing increases 70% 95% person wearing one too. Wear damn mask!

Like said, don’t want again. long immuno compromised body keep winning fight virus? I’d prefer find out. anything, Trump president made issues US clear before. dont think necessarily got worse, obvious before. West Ada school district needs money. fundraiser...which get since Idaho value education. problem school district Idaho even tell parents going back person stay online next school year.

The governor basically passed buck schools plan except ""wash hands"". school districts plan one wants take responsibility big fuck school year going be. 

If go back person teachers students die, people going pissed. Can't wait for: ""Sorry Mrs. Jones taught algebra died. Anyway, make sure finish homework gave you. worry we're sanitizing building weekend turn new teacher"". asked clarification whether fall category, understanding vaccine candidates works already SARS, ten years ago. coronaviruses, makes sense groundwork might transferable. real? prior respiratory issues stopping wearing mask, it’s best interest going anywhere mask required anyway worse worse worse worse severe within 21st century... far Yes say, much may valid, 50/50 chance essentially useless. 90-95% chance accuracy far essential.

If 50% data essentially useless, scrambling information either way, data basically useless. i'm sure worth 5 year legal immunity companies supposedly coming it. i'll curious happens court public opinion high-end? think problem states pressure reopen quickly. think longer lockdown increased stimulus, recent surge could avoided. Also, virus became partisan issue became terribly difficult get 330 million people comply. New York certainly bright spot recent darkness surrounding spike cases. Yup, let's give NYC &amp; Boston till Sept 1st see happens. people going wear masks day every day. you’re told plane federal offense. Oh see. Thanks denial stay denial matter what. saw day someone Florida sub screaming ""ShOw PHotoS VirUs!!!1!! CoNSpiRaCy!!!!!11!1!!!"" think system really hurt people broken down. Republicans primarily ones going without masks pandemic, Republicans primarily ones defend current healthcare system.

Denying Republicans health coverage recklessness might finally convince enough America's health insurance system needs change. memory 2009 swine flu. Must media intense. guess New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania chopped liver? pretty good too.  reinforce peoples belief Trump's claim reducing resting reduce deaths. Oh good fucking God active duty duh Looks like people distancing outside seem risky. Yes! Embrace vinegar! even importantly, variations poutine! got used wearing mask 3 days realized “wow isn’t bad” locked fuck start. I’m “essential” worker couldn’t help notice cars road month.
Couple serious contact tracing. masks I’d say peak 90% wearing masks grocery stores. We’ve gotten little complacent lately we’ve cases past 6 weeks. attributed truckers families. went shows 614 new cases needs attention. Statistics shown fact actually true. They'll refuse learn. always Yup like USA Canada forever changed 9/11. Sure things got back ""normal"" couple years things never normal pre 911 again. world (and especially USA even Canada innocent places. Felt safe attack another country foreign group, much anymore) innocent place then. day, I'm public especially big crowds, always check surroundings, watch people, look weird packages bags sitting around themselves. Look nervous looking people etc know everyone isnt like this, lot people need people like now. hard explain younger people born young 9/11 happened different things were. Pre 911 didnt spree shootings school shootings either. Back really big ones US history, happen time. Pre/911 liked staying highest floors hotels, loved going tops highest building different cities, anymore, makes nervous. Airports, flying makes nervous bad first years 9/11 still there. majority St. George feels way. Ridiculous. notice sexual orientation religion list immediately classified intellegence briefing? did, do. problem airline policy. appears every airline states passenger take mask eating drinking. passenger carry food beverage item say eating drinking wear mask - Cruz did, carried coffee cup ""drinking"" entire time. full flight let you. 

They also let people wear mask ""medical condition"" anyone make one wear mask.

These terrible policies step plane passengers wear mask entire flight. situation nuts, also, literally every adult date will. Well, typically would particular set skills. Skills acquired long career. Skills make nightmare criminals. think good percentage teachers quit, retire call sick. Even small percent, like 10%, going impossible find even many teachers. think lot people choose health jobs. 

It's gonna shit show everywhere schools force teachers come work. Risks life drink coffee plane airport. Looks like doesn’t make good decisions. Bureaucrats

Sounds like redneck Woodstock go court without clothes better yet judge require masks court first-gen American, embarrassed, rational peoples fault nobody born American say birth place. 

Every crisis brings also change covid potential change lot. **are** increasing. 

You look seven day moving average, weekly trends. saying widespread mask wearing would protect thousands came thread saying superstitious?

You haven’t called flu outright continual questioning people’s insistence taking extra measures don’t typically take suggests consider circumstances severe usual. common refrain people insist “just flu”, spite vast statistical differences.

As said, systemic diseases like cause acute cardiopulmonary, respiratory even renal neurological damage don’t go around time. Americans generally deemed flu enough reason discomfort themselves. 

That said, There’s reason can’t shouldn’t extend mask wearing flu protocol. People countries years now, perhaps will, people ever move past politically paranoid excuse mask wearing public sign weakness excessive social compliance. 

But suspect given current selfish conduct people won’t universally adopt mask wearing country even protect thousands less severe situations like flu season. knows, maybe change. 

But least advocate people stepping outside getting something minimally restrictive temporary mask mandates pandemic high risk freedom excluded public life without excessive risk. right, is. Masks absolutely *the* solution; sensible piece sensible policy response severe disease outbreak. us have, 30% absolute idiots ruining us. like kindergarten keep losing recess time 3 kids keep yelling class. might like spanking much Snoke: Star Wars reference. think cost rec center going magically go away students one semester? buildings mentioned. using campus internet many professors using create share lessons it. fact costs go way college invest new equipment software training professors adapt new (and temporary) environment. suck? yeah that's right now. yeah dont think vox article evidence all.

Nice.

This favorite pun moment Governor DeathSentence FL. one really knows many lives government shutdown saved. cost debatable close 3 trillion. many lives think saved? sake discussion, assumed million 2. Yep, know that’s happening. don’t resident LA county tested LA county. OC, still lie qualify test you’re asymptomatic uncommonly-symptomatic Willful Ignorance Cognitive Dissonance probably bills pay. think reason go. Yes, isn’t Obama’s fault? /s rise /r/FloridaMan  surprised. spring shutdown, many teachers nationwide receiving *death threats* ""demands"" parents (physically) report back work. American parents pretty two-faced; one hand, they'll whine cry ""dangerous"" is, yet hand, they'll demand schools re-open ""it's hard work home."" 

Like not, 70% issue stems parental irresponsibility lack respect education. Actually, san francisco many homeless better benefits places homeless. come/get sent counties states get benefit. San francisco doesnt funding care constant inflow homeless people. Ironically NYC one safer cities right now. One thousand Brazilian deaths day. terrifyingly huge number Love Mickey  saying learn college use, right. College degree classes take. degree opens wealth white collar jobs six figure salaries simply accessible people without degree. College much expensive 5, 10, 20 years ago still one best investments make terms money-in opportunities-out.

But yeah recommend taking French classes unless already economically independent going college ""to follow passion"" fun learn new things. rich politicians think rules apply them?

It would nice example put fucker jail.

My understanding vaccines vaccine works training immune system recognize combat pathogens, either viruses bacteria. this, certain molecules pathogen must introduced body trigger immune response. molecules called antigens, present viruses bacteria.

From: immunity possible, vaccine possible? that, think 100% right.

Thank you! board starting child kindergarten 3 weeks Im seriously rethinking now. SAN FRANCISCO —  There’s common refrain masks don’t protect you; protect people germs, especially important keep unknowingly infected people spreading coronavirus.
But now, there’s mounting evidence masks also protect you.

If you’re unlucky enough encounter infectious person, wearing kind face covering reduce amount virus body take in.
As turns out, that’s pretty important. Breathing small amount virus may lead disease far mild infection. inhaling huge volume virus particles result serious disease death.

That’s argument Dr. Monica Gandhi, UC San Francisco professor medicine medical director HIV Clinic Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, making — unlucky get infected virus — masking still protect severe disease.

“There theory facial masking reduces [amount virus get exposed to] disease severity,” said Gandhi, also director Center AIDS Research UC San Francisco.
...
But experts say masks essential people wear still go public, shop go medical appointments, get exercise like heading beach park.
...
The reason masks important controlling spread coronavirus widely spread people visibly sick — either haven’t yet shown signs illness, spend entire course infections little symptoms all.

A key piece evidence emerged earlier year, Diamond Princess cruise ship carried infected crew passengers Asia. study published U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention found 712 people testing positive virus, nearly half asymptomatic time testing.


“We also know viral load highest early disease,” said Dr. Chaz Langelier, assistant professor UC San Francisco, panel discussion. fact, 44% transmissions believed occur infected person symptoms, according study published Nature Medicine.
That’s different seasonal flu, peak infectiousness occurs one day onset symptoms, Langelier said.

Masks don’t filter viral particles, Gandhi said. even cloth face masks filter majority viral particles.
And even person wearing mask gets infected, mask — filtering viral particles exhaled infected person — probably leads less severe disease, Gandhi said.
...

The idea lower dose virus infected brings less illness well-worn idea medicine.

Even going back 1938, study showing giving mice higher dose deadly virus, mice likely get severe disease die, Gandhi said.

The principle applies humans. study published 2015 gave healthy volunteers varying doses flu virus; got higher doses got sicker, coughing shortness breath, Gandhi said.

And another study suggested reason second wave 1918-19 flu pandemic deadliest U.S. overcrowded conditions faced army camps World War wound down.


Finally, study published May found surgical mask partitions significantly reduced transmission coronavirus among hamsters. even hamsters protected mask partitions acquired coronavirus, “they likely get mild disease,” Gandhi said.

So happens city dramatically masks public?

If Gandhi right, may mean even there’s rise coronavirus infections city, masks may limit dose people getting virus result likely show less severe symptoms illness.

That’s Gandhi said suspects happening San Francisco, mask wearing relatively robust. observations needed, Gandhi said.


There’s evidence masks protective — even wearers become infected. cited outbreak seafood plant Oregon employees given masks, 95% infected asymptomatic.

Gandhi also cited experience cruise ship traveling Argentina Antartica March coronavirus infected people board, documented recent study. Passengers got surgical masks; crew got N95 masks.

But instead 40% infected asymptomatic — would normally expected — 81% testing positive asymptomatic, masking may helped reduce severity disease people board, Gandhi said.

The protective effects also seen countries masks universally accepted years, Taiwan, Thailand, South Korea Singapore. 

“They seen cases opened ... deaths,” Gandhi said.

The Czech Republic moved early require masks, issuing order mid-March, Gandhi said; that’s three months Gov. Gavin Newsom statewide California. Czech Republic, “every time cases would go ...their death rate totally flat. didn’t get severe illness cases going on.”

By May, Czech Republic lifted face mask rule. “And they’re great,” Gandhi said. 

Edit: Removed California-specific sections. even close. takes YEARS controlled lab environment develop proper antibody tests even they're 100% accurate. fast tracked better flipping coin see not.

Full disclosure: April confirmed positive. Took almost 2 weeks recover almost ended hospital. scary considerations:
* there’s good chance never vaccine works. 
* vaccines don’t work well upper respiratory tract anyway
* Given antibodies seem last 3 months super infectious may never obtain herd immunity
* seems like times exposed worse chances survival

This thing could go around around killing 2-5 percent population every year rest forever. repeated exposure 2-5 percent could increase. 

Then long term effects. Hiv starts mild flu like symptoms, quietly destroys immune system next 3-10 years. die. idea covid-19 going do.

To open restaurant could either open far sponsor PR status owner business could apply investment visa would need assets 1 million dollars that. 

The easiest way get cook would apply restaurant sponsor you. tons would it, could give decent list doors knock on. easiest restaurant middle nowhere people choice also tons restaurants cities would sponsor you. would work year two government processes residency certificate, free leave whatever want including open restaurant. could give details want. So, non- not-for-profit organizations pay taxes then?

I'm religious person, I'm also blame churches religious people nothing. 29,389 days remaining century mother Earth whip something comparable even worse, human population continuing increase... live Vermont, 90% higher people wear masks, higher percentage indoors. anecdote, went grocery store days ago. single person without mask. also employee sitting watching make sure people go right way aisles stay six feet apart. even saw yell “stay six feet apart” group older folks talking. laughed, moved asses six feet apart. People aren’t fucking around here, border NY, saw shitstorm. Also, new infections predominately younger people, doctors better learned treat virus. Don’t expect death rate come anywhere near March/April (especially since outbreaks Northeast fueled nursing/veterans homes). said, be/still unacceptably high. Third paragraph definitely something considered before. us pretty well w/out college (esp programmers)... maybe good year people going tech fields least try Udemy, online routes...obviously everyone, schools built online may cheaper.. WGU think pretty affordable online. tests tampered. Bc hospitals make money saying ppl die covid. make trump look bad. entire world it. Rural US swear hear everywhere turn. ppl joke.  2023 - max capacity produce 1 billion / year ---- that's bit late imo Scotland far fewer dense urban areas, too. four cities England nearly many citizens whole Scotland, one double population. Scotland sitting countries comparable populations Europe. really, probably hinting lesser talked part strategy. fact Sweden hospitalise elderly, people 80 65 pre-existing condition giving oxigen (not ventilators, basic oxigen masks) antibiotic hospitalise. mean... it'd actual tangible consequence, least there's that. mean? good friends family going really rough time, could give points pick little. something look forward to. make us pliable sheep, melty squeaky cheese fries hearty gravy, nom nom nom. hot af last week.

I can't even imagine flagrantly businesses would abuse legal immunity even pretend care workers customers. Sure continue way. People wear masks time anyway due pollution. gov’t already set travel bubbles business travellers.

That’s literally he’s saying. making everyone Air Force One wear mask? Pilots, press, security, President? Thank you!!! hadn’t thought searching way :) walking around Manhattan yesterday. Parts city look like scene Purge. even correct number, that's taking account many adults school, things like parents would get infected kids. 

She's treating like would chicken pox, sweeps district infects basically everyone, taking account children come contact many adults ALSO immunity already previous infection... feel like title makes sense, I’m dumb normie words, works (shortsighted) interest top 1% people general receiving healthcare education. 1. dont know handful is. 2. straight wrong. wonky-ass generalizations, even attempt saying something valuable. problem anytime googled kids can't carry coronavirus end non scientific sources. Telling you, rich people politicians immune law. They’re good follow it. read article, title all. media asked Dr. Zhang future epidemic.

Zhang said world divided two categories, one China, strictly controls virus, Europe, completely eliminated virus.

China cannot completely closed off. question deal communication two worlds.

What Dr Zhang saying Chinese afraid virus. Compared United States, 70K cases per day, country operating normally.

The Chinese allow dozens cases per day, happen opening border. overpursue zero cases.

It could thought attempt reassure public opening border future.

 Background story: Previously, Europe demanded China Europe open borders. China rejected Europe public opinion. idea Chinese open border country next years. Seagulls. businesses, pay taxes.

Besides pilot plane crew, could catch Covid need ventilator care. want get covid stay home take self distancing seriosuly. job involves high contact people quit change jobs. 

It's choice. take actions vaccine whether everyone else lockdown anyway, difference make you?

Even can't test track new cases, still lock inside without vaccine could flare anytime since miniscule % population gets tested going public places could contributing it. Ew, David! **not** lean conservative decent person. shitshow we've walking towards last 40 years…

I'm conservative, need moderates decently functioning democracy. Take care mate.  Florida last week nobody wearing masks nuts Blushing.

Then there's asshole Northern states followed reopening guidelines CDC. also actively encouraged social distancing masks pushed businesses making law/policy. 


The southern states turned masks political issue. Laughed social distancing. didnt even bother following CDC guidelines. they're paying price.


Bottom line southern states wanted go back normal northern states going new normal. fire burns field once. that, fire risk low. see, last time jack shit late, time decided thing, including acting surprised jack shit effective. not, also significant youth losing important years experiences lives. hopes eventually vaccine gets made, gets scaled distributed country-wide. Even then, there's people saying refuse vaccine, meaning fully effective even things happen.

There's lot consider here, people avoid consequences shutting things down, real permanent. limited time planet. We're 10 years olds once. We're 18 once. generation risk losing entire year here. end? vaccine January? irony fine, I'm playing along.  I'm pretty positive ones decide they're striking, loopholes. reacted faster Sweden didn't, like article says. remember Cruz needed isolate exposed someone covid early on. ever hear tested positive? Must hell shot... circumstances surrounding air travel recirculated air plane. Sen. Cruz's health. contracted COVID19 flight? He's Texas large number cases deaths are. telling leader State, wants send message? Kind irresponsible. time cases getting lower. increasing again.

So, even he's perfectly healthy think would man put inconvenience short encourage others save lives. Americans dumb cocky. believe crisis begun. months evictions skyrocket, still big unemployment numbers, Covid around worse fall schools reopen. definitely another stimulus. Good. Enough barbarism already turn people onto streets. Pregnant sick people even. 

We shelter available, people need shelter. OK, we'll let in... Could be, would mildly inconvenient surely nobody wants that! visited last weekend it’s pretty nice. crowds tourist traps gone outdoor dining makes look much Parisian. don’t think NYC dependent tourism places like Florida- hence Florida refuses shut down.

Edit: nvm realized troll. Glad better. Sorry assholes continue increase risk everyone.  criminal act people disregard rights safety others. feel entire Republican Party accomplices murder. want put kids hands, F that, thanks. That's report seasonally-adjusted excess deaths.

Even Democrats Senate Finance Committee privately expressed concern potential benefit disincentivize work, Washington Post previously reported.

“From numerous conversations people White House — understand redoing $600-per-week benefit would really bad economy really bad fall, need recovery,” said Stephen Moore, conservative analyst White House ally. “The stakes really enormous here.”

Moore, citing conversations multiple small-business owners, described talk taking benefit $200 per week “very objectionable.""

“We go back old unemployment program, want help people financially payments go everyone,” Moore said.

But pandemic still raging many parts country, clear whether safe return work places. interviews, many workers said money provided different incentive — living sick at-risk family members health conditions prioritize health concerns instead pushed look risky work paycheck. also happens die unless good amount life insurance.

Senior Trump administration officials begun signaling willingness approve narrow extension enhanced unemployment benefits helping tens millions jobless Americans hurt coronavirus pandemic.

In less two weeks, federal program provides $600-per-week increase unemployment benefits expire. Many economists warn disappearance enormous federal stimulus, created March, could hinder economic recovery deprive millions Americans vital financial lifeline.

More 30 million people collecting many recipients say crucial pillar financial support right now.

“We’d basically choose paying bills eating,” Erin Walker, 48, furloughed job dining manager college campus near Summerville, S.C., end April, said looming expiration benefits. “I honestly don’t know would do.”

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) June 30 said added unemployment benefits set expire July “mistake.” (The Washington Post)

For months, President Trump White House officials argued $600-per-week unemployment bonus provides disincentive work scrapped Americans return work part economic recovery. benefits soon set expire economy showing new signs strain, Trump administration officials begun opening door accepting narrower version Congress previously approved.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said CNBC last week administration’s priority ensuring future benefits amount “no more” 100 percent worker’s prior wages. Mnuchin’s comments surprised congressional Republicans thought shared strong opposition extending benefits, according two people spoke condition anonymity describe internal dynamics.

Larry Kudlow, president’s top economic adviser, told Fox Business Monday administration seeking “some unemployment reforms.” Kudlow previous weeks aggressively bashed $600-per-week increase.

Kudlow also pushed “return work” bonus could supplement reduction unemployment benefits. idea viewed administratively difficult implement path passage unclear, according three lobbyists congressional aides aware internal conversations.

One potential compromise discussed Republican lawmakers would involve cutting unemployment benefit $600 per week $200 $400 per week making least part difference sending another round $1,200 stimulus payments, people said.

On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said next package would include “unemployment insurance unable get back work,” though identify much aid would necessary.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said statement administration opposed $600-per-week increase would rule administration agreeing limited expansion benefit. Maintaining unemployment insurance benefits current levels “does incentivize returning work,” Deere said email. “UI reform priority White House phase four package ongoing discussions Hill.”

The emergency, temporary federal benefits come top payments appropriated state governments, though benefits vary. Democrats largely called benefits extended.

Lawmakers little time resolve competing positions. Republicans discussed issue internally reached caucus position matter. serious bipartisan discussions underway resolve impasse. Senate comes back session July 20, five days enhanced unemployment benefit expires 49 states. expire New York state July 26.

“They don’t time, scary this,” said Bill Hoagland, senior vice president Bipartisan Policy Center former Republican staff director Senate Budget Committee. “It’s irresponsible.”

Trump offered little clarity preferred outcome, saying Fox Business last month benefits: “We something wanted gave disincentive work last time. still money going people helping people, that. want create great incentive work. we’re working that, I’m sure we’ll come together.”

More 1 million Americans continue apply jobless benefits every week, rise coronavirus cases across country threatens prompt new wave shutdowns. still 1.6 million fewer job openings February — although rose slightly May — raising question whether many Americans job return to.

June’s jobs numbers showed United States recovered third jobs lost worst coronavirus crisis. economy appears worsened weeks since, signs improve expanded unemployment benefits expire. March June, United States saw steady decrease share households expected income fall within next month — 39 percent 31 percent, weekly census survey showed. end June, 34 percent Americans — 1 3 — reported expected see income fall coming month.

The unemployment benefits helped stabilize economic turbulence unemployment rate rose roughly 15 percent April falling slightly 11 percent June. Americans made $70 billion less wages salaries May compared February, reflecting lost jobs cuts hours wages. Emergency unemployment benefits filled gap, funneling $70 billion per month economy, according Ernie Tedeschi, worked economist Obama administration’s Treasury Department.

Tyler Kemp, unemployed 38-year-old lives mother subsidized housing Las Vegas area, said benefits allowed him, first time long time, feel financial cushion, mother unforeseen medical expenses, example.

“If stuff expires, means won’t money emergency things,” said. “It’s like security blanket hasn’t long.”

Removing lifeline could spell hardship millions Americans. 30 million Americans would see income cut 50 percent 75 percent benefits go away, Tedeschi said.

Darrick Hamilton, economist Ohio State University, said letting benefits expire “would make recession deeper, longer entrenched. get downward spiral people lose income pay bills, affect people collect income bills well.”

“The way prevent depression recession keep aggregate demand up,” Hamilton said. “We also need stop people’s suffering pain.”

A recent analysis daily data economists University Illinois, University Chicago University California Berkeley found relationship generosity state’s benefits rate citizens returning work coronavirus crisis. ""The rules thee, me."" - GOP saying. depend type, vent like FFP masks allows air pass going out. Fuck need leaders like this!!!! *- brother died swallowing mosquito.*

Found interesting [article that. asked question. Something someone said back made think always dormant form way another recent environmental changes could possibly triggered activate. look I'm spouting nonsense here, poles melting permafrost thawing microorganisms frozen thousands years thawed proven reactivate frozen permafrost. knows sort novel organisms humans may never experienced ecosystem. mean Siberia fire Christ sake. planet changed us, accelerated natural process exacerbated it. natural cycle eventually civilization progresses far enough alter planet kind way planet keeps check. listen though random guy internet full ideas even though pretty bad ideas. You’re hero Georgia needs right now, hero deserves. you’ve ever lied life, you’re honest? bar really want set? 

Edit: added words link below. good accounting “hurrr Fauci lied never asthma ( severe average). Admittedly, challenging wearing mask exerting think keeping life worthwhile trade off. Also, that's inhaler!! Yeah I'd agree that. agree people online offering medical advice ""talk doctor"" link actual credible source. point money there. half ambulance fee. could headlines lazy read full statements days sure seems like Fauci keeps giving unrealistic timelines / hope vaccine - wrong? That’s interesting. didn’t know anything American water anecdotes I’ve heard people I’m certain states. didn’t know enough comment impression great? Firstly, small infection (probably one treatable?) lot different epidemic without cure.

Like said, people looking differently, argue point made I'm gonna assume look Chinese people differently since virus, that's problem.

Secondly, agree China probably hiding numbers Trump literally said rally 'slow testing says 83,000 cases right now, even number extremely inacurate say TEN TIMES number would still 830,000 compared US's 3.5 million. *after* Trump told slow testing.
Keep mind China also higher population higher population density.

What's that? 10 times reported amount still enough? Fine let's 40 times, still 3.3 million. unless China somehow hiding 98% cases that's ridiculous argument make. We’ve known since February restrictions travel Germany side? mean state departments recommendation travel there? Florida normal time year, Texas isn't.

Considering general sentiment NY public comments region outbreak, stay fuck away now. 

If can't polite someone going rough time, can't expect politeness back. It’s like movie Jerk. People like, “all need schools open. that’s need. Well, need restaurant open too, that’s need. bar. that’s need! need nail salon.” Encouraging people engage, persuade, anti-vaxxers good thing. need careful turn movement bully people taking vaccine covid. 

We know vaccines take years develop, primarily extensive amount testing establish safe. Despite efforts, vaccines later found harmful. example, one. facing covid pandemic, naturally want push covid vaccine quickly possible. natural, valid, concern whether *rushed* covid vaccine indeed safe widespread use. unreasonable people decide taking rushed covid vaccine. make anti-vaxxers. 

The last thing need build *another* cult advocates use vaccine approved government mindlessly. yet cry bloody murder call it. I'm sorry parents went thru that. wear mask every time go store nervous stories like this. want yelled trying safe. honestly kind scary. bright side, least masks mandatory. start back without even requiring masks.

## Abstract

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused infection severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), become global pandemic. currently remains unclear whether convalescing patients risk reinfection. generated rhesus macaque model SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized interstitial pneumonia systemic viral dissemination mainly respiratory gastrointestinal tracts. Rhesus macaques reinfected identical SARS-CoV-2 strain early recovery phase initial SARS-CoV-2 infection show detectable viral dissemination, clinical manifestations viral disease, histopathological changes. Comparing humoral cellular immunity primary infection rechallenge revealed notably enhanced neutralizing antibody immune responses. results suggest primary SARS-CoV-2 exposure protects subsequent reinfection rhesus macaques. US Constitution says Hi... Yupp clearednthe backlogg cases andnnow low positive ratio. takes one get ball rolling, 35 days way enough time get many. Especially thought negative isolated sea, cared masks distancing going go limb say American health workers paid, way, way French counterparts, decades. Judging use “maths” guessing schooling US.

1. doubt schools happens. referring testing situation - educators working hard get fixed. super, example, encourage use test assessment schools uses several metrics account it.

2. don’t set correct answers questions often guided student responses. written curriculum every school district worked for. Except teaching math really correct answer - child got answer way incorrect, best practices include prove second way (and yes first graders, even - number sense work encourages developing multiple ways see numbers reason) reevaluate work incorrect. Reasons also best practices include working partners groups sharing way thinking. ever flat say “MAN WAY THINK WRONG?” No...because would discourage discourse free thinking. ask find made made small error could effect work later...

3. hard pressed find school US teachers merely lecturing expecting students regurgitate information. hold Socratic seminars, discussions, encourage students support answers using text research. answer. actual area expertise, tell again, aside working state mandated test (which account less 2 weeks school year preparing for) expecting specific answer, ask students defend work. Again. Promoting free thinking. areas work understanding authors, biases, effect media students receiving. 

No school system perfect, tell harming system US happening within schools, brilliant teachers using best practices learn around world. government officials continuously push “accountability” faulty tests, parents want children practiced old school ways “learned” like. hoovervilles seem like great place spread COVID-19. Also rename Trump Towns reflect times? I'm saying anything initial comment. man gets fired, totally allowed upset it. say he's honest, lied American public.

You believe lies justified - fine. still make honest

And yes. I'm talking lie March. onset pandemic US, opportunity contain threat need mask protect time protect wear mask SARS-COV-2-virus airborne larger drops. cough spread lot longer away 2 social physical distancing. sing also get drops push long way away. speaking get drops travel quit bit. 

By using mask stop biggest drops leaving inhale people's big drops. Thus protected.

Some sizes drops hanhs around suspended mid air longer time couple seconds. think drops around hours. infectious drops droplets falls surface linger longer therefore need either use kind gloves touch surfaces wash hands without touching faces use handsanitizer soon touched surface.

I going use face mask disposable gloves really long period time forward, ar least March April next year current thinking, perhaps even longer. far tell, article sites one study. And, don’t think it’s great study. study also sites may bc non protestors stayed home protests. doesn’t mean protests didn’t spread covid. means every restaurant store closing every major downtown area stemmed tide enough make spread protests caused. bc something worthwhile doesn’t mean won’t spread virus. Hugging grandma good. It’s also risk. Exactly. proverbs apply are:

The death rate overall seem low, people long-term impacts this.

There things like get sun/vitamin D/zinc/exercise/eat well, etc.

Also, reporting lags. Tests take 5-10 days results, local govs sometimes report weeks. Deaths lag. deaths reported April.

Honestly, hard know believe reporting. would like following score football game online seeing stats 4 games ago mixed stats current game. ‘Fear’ ‘two’ people infected. saying hopefully policies place prevent massive spikes. link prove point idiot Yeah well, also can't take COVID related spontaneous combustion table.

Scientists discovered one genes, genes have, already structure close one needed bind virus well little adaptationn needed.

This good news vaccines really. Exactly probably undercounted deaths.

I suppose possible showing look [CDC excess deaths (Select Florida ""Select Jurisdiction"" box.) add weekly predicted deaths average weekly expected deaths going back March 1, get 4,040 (which actually lower state's current reported COVID-19 death count 4,277).

For whatever reasons, Southeast get hit hard really compared Northeast. Florida's daily death rate starting rise important put rise context. current 7-day moving average daily death rate 72, translates 3.35 deaths / 1M pop. (At peak, figure New York state hit around 50.) Here's nice set charts show daily death rate different states different regions also forget Florida one largest elderly populations US State. Something like 80% US COVID-19 deaths individuals aged 65 older. Around 20.5% Florida's population 65+ vs. like 16.4% New York, around 15% US whole.

Suggesting Brazil far hidden cases US. Absolutely disgusting company. real world, one sentence would come back make meal oversized ass.

In whatever fuck living now... much. course Zodiac Killer isn’t gonna care wearing mask. problem story **we've also seen photos wearing mask plane**--he put finished coffee.

No haven't. They're different arm rests. Different planes.

Also article: *The original version story implied Ted Cruz photographed wearing mask American Airlines flight earlier seen wearing face covering. second photo ofCruz different flight Sunday.** Yeah, pres [the CDC mouth nose cloth face cover around could spread COVID-19 others even feel cloth face cover meant protect people case Everyone wear cloth face cover public settings around people don’t live household, especially social distancing measures difficult maintain. 

So, yeah, US actually better Sweden here. sentence never thought I'd write lol.  unfortunate come severe case.. might changed mind. Might work trump well. Protestors outdoors far better wearing masks general population. rise cases people protesting lives, it’s likely fair bit less people going reason all. Even double amount compensate year halfway done. numbers covid deaths compared causes death compatibly low. mean, straight said death toll includes anybody covid positive. get shot face die bullet, tested positive corona, that's covid death. make sense? 

This thing already bad enough, inflating numbers? accident. People need reminded. Young old. us, who's going remind them? president? He's terrible role model whole pandemic. finally photographed wearing mask 7 months pandemic. He's freaking turd deserve daily covid tests Good thing neither contagious. missed first. That’s brilliant. Haha Still supposed social distance even mask seems like people get that. mask mean go hug everyone Probably, yeah. according Fauci, that's primary reason lied Weird, what's difference Ted Cruz yahoo White House? disagreeing idea need go mask nonbelievers seems what's appropriate Ted Cruz also applicable anyone else elected people.

But I'll add caveat well school possible missed fine print constitution.... Last heard mitch friends wanted five year ban covid related workplace lawsuits, especially involving putting people undue risk providing ppe   hope know November Serious question. long health care workers put this? point, don’t see bunch quit? protests Toronto well see sort surge it

Things kept trending downwards anything

Google photos ""Toronto protests BLM""; look many people wearing masks. 

Google photos Hong Kong protests happening entire time Covid, still happening. many people wearing masks? ""bUt ClOsEd bOrDeR cHiNa!"" God help hear one damn time! Clinton guy big thing mouth president often media or? 

That one thing gf like i... need spit really good working... 

Saxophon called. Yeah remember him, better times. overbooked plane wanted give seat someone else.

This False.

Board Education trying demonstrate children selfish moron. Taking this, applied New York State - according Syracuse, 402,000 people postive. Assuming one fifth total cases, number becomes two million. total population new york approximately 19.5 million people, Making positive ten percent. Another thing bring mind half cases NYC, densely populated area.  URL/page hijacked ad service they're using. Plenty sites problem.

And that's case anything else say you, clearly bigger issues can't help with, good luck. world would think Trump would want help "" average Joe""? post history probably think virus hoax.

You're assuming. cute please that. 

I guess let country crumble huh? desantis? children siblings human interaction? children exist, need target additional support specifically, put children siblings, multigenerational household members, parents neglectful risk falling ill Lol wait, what? Cancer heart disease kill 126 125 Florida residents day, recent full year stats.

They choose instead take 0 precaution, despite easy do.

Do buckle seat airplane? wear helmet bike riding? 

I’m guessing type person throws fit asked something simple, even could potentially benefit yourself. 

I suggest deep introspection, look self mirror, ask yourself, putting others risk simply wearing mask?

Rest world without US, Brazil, India, Russia - population 5 764 800 000  What? Please tell joke? honestly believe UK government recommend masks prevent companies losing trivial amount money people slightly time make inferior masks? takes minutes make mask anyway.... ?

Even assume ridiculous motivation present. make sense anyway profits additional 3 months mask wearing would much greater nearly non existent amount lost people making (which said, easily still do).

Teachers want school (and 3-month long summers really hurt retention information) every year school year expands bit more... later June, earlier August. Speed limits work. Seatbelts do. Wear seatbelts. kids going school, huge added burden, mentally financially

Idk I'd think kid spreading coronavirus dozen people would much mentally financially burdensome, no?

If rather risk odds vs. deadly virus take care child maybe made mistake choosing children. unfair make people suffer due mistakes. lot people valley lately wearing masks though gives hope beginning change mind. said, dude day straight tell democrat plot help Biden win something. Like, motherfucker, virus care democrat republican. sure? Anyone think there’ll another shut down? Good hear, I've needing new knee fluid. Dark web? :) I'm sure one ever cited evidence before.

The ad hominem fallacy fallacy arguing someone insulting you, can't defend point. can, mean everything says issue proof validity masks. point people wearing masks ones say facts cites lies designed to.... destroy America somehow. Saying ""it saves lives"" wont stop ""it's conspiracy!"" morons. Nordics use masks no, natural social distancing helps yes, situation could even better masking. 

And there's whole scandal recommendations masking loosened elder care, recent masks recommended. Yes, that’s I’m saying, ‘concerned’ stupid. many business owners short sighted unwilling understand even unwilling compromise fit business model? Maybe shouldn’t running business can’t way prevents spread protects patrons. articulated elsewhere, including sub. usually gets downvoted oblivion groupthink anti science ignorant rednecks 100% blame. Even purchase back February?  take point, family Florida disagree points. 

I’ve family members tell hoax meant hurt Trump (not media). 



3. Obviously science messy understanding grows time. discussions require level nuance seems impossible entertain people. example, masks effective preventing transmission, likely won’t protect wearer others. 


Of course preaching people get nowhere. you’re someone claims: 1) less deadly flu 2) large scale mislabeling cause death Covid (the example used car crash) 3) Democrat’s want keep economy shut November hurt Trump. 



Getting wear mask would small victory, would nice lived planet. Investigation? crime? They’ll probably implement “No taking pictures American Airlines’ property” rule. That’ll fix everything. I’m also enthusiast, nowhere go there’s much point leaving house imo. Especially since lot stuff closed. go leisure drive times month I’m driving cars every day like normal. need economy thats designed able protect workers scenario like this. absolute hell wrong country (rhetorical question, list massive) Covdiotic maskholes Nah.  hide per usual. would think politicians would love opportunity literally keep public eye. gives ultimate excuse, yet idiots like still wear mask. flew AA June. enforce masks. 20% people wearing them. Christ Dark shit....

I informally wrote mine back March...... Like said yesterday, think can’t get worse, does. much worse get? would gladly sacrifice 100.000 pandemic over? That's selfish. nobody says building monuments abusing workers cheap technology selfish inhumane. one can't justify tbe other. Oh, dont worry, we're 20 years in; gets *much* worse! Maybe 40 years ago. started school August every year growing decade I've teacher too. year earliest starting date ever me, go back students first week August. Thank feedback. I'll trust insider info ;) curiosity, immunocompromised person choose get nursing first place? think would inherently higher risk professions. TLDR: omg stop pointing NE. Forget early deaths. Florida villain. hear? They're testing more... test more, find deaths. Fellow argie here, gracias por tu comment.

Es una pena ver cómo la mayoría de RE-DI-TU-RROS argentinos son unos trolls macristas sinverguenzas. Pero alegra ver cada tanto una persona con cerebro como vos, es una de las razones por las cuales voy la mierda de este antro (Sí deje r/argentina, la agenda pro-Macri/Espert daba cringe) [Looks like needed 2 Quick emotional response.

Weak intellect.
Herd mentality.

Any weak little quips? 

You really, really bad getting across point right point. expect respect people wear masks emotional?

I 100% willing change opinion give good enough reason English really Americans Europe, they?  two even causally linked

The comment article also said confirmed clusters began suggests likely causal. Canadian American data protests anti-mask BLM, know Covid spread open air, significantly less able to, similarly significantly able spread indoors

Also add UK list. saw spikes following BLM protests. welcome, people awful, hope best, prepared worst. There's also mounting evidence closed air systems spread virus readily push infections. new information either; since beginning speculated summer months easiest months us since people outdoors there's less spread. data comes countries hit hardest first (all northern countries winters) also seen well Europe Canada managed virus since weather became nice (while Australia suddenly issues winter, virus exploding across southern hemisphere exactly predicted. 

Even US, big spreaders tend 1) people going business normal, 2) people forced back work offices indoor buildings, 3) bars clubs, 4) parties. 

This say outdoor spread happen, indoor spread carries higher risk wearing mask -- countries undercut expended growth 80% making masks mandatory everywhere outside, limiting indoor spaces people could go. 100% high. 

That said, know even outdoor beach ""Covid parties"" spreader events, less powerful indoor spreader events, know sure masks precautions impact movements since seem correlated breakouts given protests happen compared breakouts happen (some biggest protests northern states managing virus really well -- prime spreader, states larger protests would spikes, states smaller fewer protests) Normalcy bias: post. even obligatory mention he's zodiac killer Ok makes sense. flawed may best way estimate true cases. However still disagree 16% population enough keep numbers low compared March April. hell I'm epidemiologist could right. *Grim Reaper entered chat* Great time kittens!!! dick human returns it.

Our 2 cats much lovey talkative we're around time! Also, they're taking numerous naps day around us, whereas they'd typically go hide somewhere get front window sleep. whole point lockdown end virus least deaths possible. Herd immunity WOULD work. It’s crazy new concept. means maximum deaths would happen. Yes, pretend problem run away, well done. Jesus.. wake feeling like every day :( Deaths peaked pandemic peaked end march, beginning april. 

Using weather 3 months later excuse seems bit far fetched. Also one educated populations country, there’s reason state doesn’t suck saying long wait times there's low cases Covid-19?  Well...then maybe US close hospitals! Also, stop testing we'll zero cases forever! Seems NFL may decided yet fan rules be. isn’t perfectly half due preferential inactivation, also isn’t random. Cells one lineage inactivated chromosome. 

There evidence 12% genes inactivated chromosome still transcribed. doesn’t necessarily mean double immune system, immune system isn’t single gene solely X chromosome. fact, see sometimes genes activated selectively silenced chromosomes inactivated corresponding active chromosome, sometimes expressed preferentially expressed non-silenced chromosome. 
 
Women much less likely experience x-linked disorders due preferential inactivation well standard inactivation. genes expressed, it’s variable women. 

The current theory autoimmune disease relation sex hormones (estrogen, testosterone) rather x-chromosome expression. isn’t recent article [detailed. [interesting discussing autoimmune disorders related X chromosome referencing variable gene expression maternal/paternal X chromosomes X-inactivation.

TLDR X chromosome likely play part immune system notable variations immune system function related androgens estrogens. Women lack sufficient estrogen levels (ovarian removal, post-menopausal) higher risk illness. funny people this, family Argentina suspended travel inside country closed borders. took 120 days get 100k cases first detection vast majority inside capital.

... would imagine 35 test entire crew. tolerant BS Sounds like perfect time open schools. nice parts france Higher levels vitamin D, lower initial viral load, less recent illnesses already weakened bodies. Institutions often use knowledge base make decisions; however, really depends professor doing. professoriate reliant service, teaching, research. would likely fall service, limited three--especially research institutions. 

As educator, definitely say make point assist institution. remember business administrative team (and others) people doctorates MBAs well equally make decisions.

Plus there's entire concept organized anarchy contend with. Seeing lot Florida Texas plates west too. Hilarious stuff That’s much big brain work them. US bailed airlines too. Think that.

Not happen anyways. pro teams get special treatment... Correct imagine teacher 15 minutes day see kids swapping face shield?  people buy idea sacrificing comfort worth saving lives, sadly appears rather unpopular idea states.  brother lives rural county Oregon compares Kentucky -- except poorer even fewer kids graduate high school. heard sunshine &amp; heat going get rid Covid-19! Mostly 40% Americans believe it, Russian puppet wannabe dictator told hoax. local public school gave kids recess 3 days week, behaved enough. son's 1st grade class constantly held side recess....because wouldnt sit still enough desks. teacher called son sitting chair work, ""sitting like frog"". come get day. 1st grade kids move much get giant excercise rubber bands placed around legs desk chairs keep feet rubber bands.

We pulled out, homeschooled second half 1st grade lots sports, found private school 2and, academically advanced, reading 3rd grade books always great math.

This year I'm trying get k12 online school. 

Btw, work desk cant keep feet perfectly still even 1 hour. Wtf schools think 6 year olds day!? 2 weeks infection defined time threshold diagnostic quarantine early on, 99% people going ultimately show symptoms, would shown symptoms time period.

Read sentence carefully. \~1% people incubation period longer two weeks. Maybe 50% people **don't show symptoms all.** lot willing downplay symptoms **might** COVID means get earn living feed family they're told getting sick means destitution.

You could perform tests quarantined people, sensitivity tests MISERABLE, 50%, 80%, depends administer particular test use time long incubation takes person's particular immune system.

Testing day 0, day 7, day 14 least stands reasonable chance catching cases, sounds like test day 0. would throw negative anybody who'd caught previous several days, people who'd caught far back 10 days previous... even perfect test.

You perfect test -  Better late never. say again, seem problem comprehending - **never** RTC shows face mask wearing general public *any* benefit reducing spread *any* virus - ***not one.*** perhaps didnt try see China break again... whole again...

The rest country small handful cases. Atlantic provinces around 10 cases total combined. anybody check percent formula report correct? Jayzus Kryste! really need stop testing! rate positive tests grew 4.4 June 8.7 July. suggests US testing enough. I'm aware that. I'm saying shouldnt assume ADE + reinfections couldnt cause something similar covid-19. Throw stupid ass jail. Every week going two 9/11's Rules thee me. Indoctrination North Korea, pretty much. nephews wear masks everyday school Japan.

Also comes tenure pensions, know people want teach Texas leave Texas reasons. hi. landlords leeches. them. pandemic. landlord still collecting rent, lowest scum earth. flew work shortly changed policy didn’t realize it. terrifying social distancing fight. morbidly hilarious asked everyone maintain social distancing airport disembarked.

America: wow fuck country bet it’s China need follow great strong example step up.

Everyone else: god hate Americans Speaking American, dont blame all.  Thanks thoughtful comment. Facts. death rates Florida deaths per million Florida start ramping I’m shitting government. also it’s local governments higher degree state governments. Bumfuck Florida isn’t Miami shouldn’t need treated caution low population density. it'd take prove graph excess deaths vs covid reported deaths FL. I've idea get data, I'm sure it'd interesting.

I mean, packed concert BLM protest same, sports, beaches even safer protest, outdoors dining patios. he's special little snowflake mask would make melt.   Maybe tiny hands couldn’t quite get mask on? you’re saying isn’t argument wearing masks, it’s reason everyone wearing them.

 never said reason wear them. made comment people do.

My mask protect *me* getting it. point disputing. It’s hard social distance six young adults living house 100% person color. Karens scares airliner bullshit like this. Scotland one step ahead England good stuff one step behind reopening. mandatory face masks back (we’re mandatory two weeks) haven’t reopened pubs gyms yet pubs gyms opening next week terms schools opening, it’s even county county. districts too, could wind portion schools given area open closed. This! AZ flattening TX. shows virus controlled without shut down. virus much weaker doesn’t spread certain time certain region. Hang Florida things better gone next 3-4 weeks max. comes ultra Patriots.... Covid19 play flown Air Canada weirdness everyone wearing masks felt perfectly safe. country garbage fire full idiots can't really compare... Masks reduce chances spreading virus. Masks actual benefit everyone everyone uses them. 

Doctors religious leaders media members spreading fear saying wearing masks. would prefer Rep. Ted since COVID lives longer metal materials. That's equivalent Florida twenty five thousand tests per day, Americans familiar size. Database updates equal # cases. Imagine life series events event row database. new event make new person. still you. “what if” scenario “whataboutism” ridiculous. You’re trying disregard carnage took place (I’m NJ well) say “well Florida.” 

NY like 8 times many deaths right now. Let’s ignore taunt others. months ago now. higher  live country run Liberals province run Liberals.

The infection rate county zero since start. yet single case.

If American would burning governors mansion bare minimum. watching American News day politician flat refused recommend wearing mask middle surge. Instead made bullshit philosophical arguments self interest.

Apples supply chain wrecked half stores shut down. 

Less consumer spending means advertising spend means less ad revenue. Ads majority Facebook Google's business. unsubstantial part Apples business. Amazon's profits way too, given they've suspend shipping many items.

Not single companies objectively worth penny December. contrary, would taken bit, albeit lesser one, companies rational market.  

They're winners economy, least losers. yet money flows anyways. apple fall far tree. Guess is... [US taking advantage crisis? Nah, radical wrongthink We’ll need (cheap scalable) vaccine candidates work though we’re going vaccinate everyone, like CanSino’s Imperial College’s. Oxford’s vaccine isn’t type give booster shots for. I'm saying general lack faith Manitoba regarding health care. enjoy showing emerg HSC waiting 6 hours see doctor 8 minutes. go emerg first place? family docs far between. 

And comparisons directed US? medical systems world compare Canadian one to? sure. life feel fortunate living spread rural region.

However communities like mine mostly southern states still experiencing high rates infection. 

If people coming work daily basis argue wear mask, wonder much longer community we're bad southern states.

Also perception rural communities pretty bad. registered 50 new cases tomorrow people would like 50 cases, cares? would result something like third coronavirus cases county reported *in single day*. small communities start spiking, one cares notices raw numbers much smaller place like NYC. know firsthand significant spike right reopening ridiculed pointing out. End life expensive humans, too. Oh see. Yes sentence correct though. Exactly. experience similar knowing people recovered. rough go, not. Nobody denying people serious lasting effects, many people sub comes mentally unhealthy. keep grandma home bars? no, turned riots police attacked people. That's point. know Beth job, Cruz dick, random twitter guy said never asked wear mask totally full shit. Could none, idea. guess 15K (!) Sunday, think they've done good. stepping including going away gifts opening Disney. followed link scrolled bottom said 215. Tbh, always terrible geography, willing corrected # countries. So, spike NYC Boston? answer anything totems? ""I covid I'm sick leave"". 5 year old could better

Fuck guy seriously Surprise, leaving flu invasion either! Numbers NY north going pretty steadily though seems like we’re working. compassion important, think confirm, Scandinavia. Per capita US getting parity Western Europe infection rates minuscule comparatively targeted. honestly amazing baby boomers think invincible. dad 70 still working FL, going fly Colorado meeting FL organization talk it. Cases FL exploding thought would ok a) fly FL airport b) meet people around FL. huge family can't stand thought leaving them.  That's always Republican game-plane. Force crisis. Say private industry better job. Farm responsibilities no-bid ""temporary"" contract company owned GOP-friendly donor. Gradually sell assets government agency pennies dollar said company. Determine (without evidence study) said company great job, make permanent. Said company returns favor lots donations GOP.

It's planned government agencies eventually.

That way, control ""data"", message, purse strings. fascist utopian plan. know could negotiate biology. [Aged like like milk see that, see beyond reasonable discussion. nice day. Thanks!

U know many kids dont know underlying conditions. shit show idiots running things, fault taking voting seriously. Also parents: SAID FOLLOWED CDC GUIDELINES COULD OUTBREAK HAPPEN ;( delusion fuck think won't. Keep coping, reality assert itself. Check statistics many people die flu year. 
The flu virus circular ""corona shaped"" virus like Covid-19. 300million people USA example, around 50-56thousand die flu virus average year
 That's U.S., check rest world maybe look back 20 years. course, think empathetic think wonder many 20 years spent wearing mask probably 0.

Perhaps think Zika virus, swine avian flus- corona shaped viruses, west Nile virus, etc. Please research emotions get better you. might give impression much less informed.

Infected dead 2 different things well. look 2 amount recovered. next time airline industry gets bailout, flat nationalized. vast majority companies suck comes pricing, service, planes, overall experience. know government would even better job point I'm sick companies basically getting away everything answer regulators customers, answer shareholders. going force make hard choices without help

The republican version aid. nuanced sub... correct take apparently New Zealand's success 100% attributable actions taken superior leaders, nothing due fact island 40x less land 100x less people United States. Even slightly apt comparison like Germany, I've downvoted pointing US 28x larger area control. Masks reduce chance spreading virus virus.
""Doctors religious leaders media members spreading fear saying wearing masks""

Yes are. saying need masks time making people feel scared. literally making people think big scary ""Virus"" (who nobody cares little details like viral load immune system, rest little details) everyone. ""They could asymptomatic!!"" ""You could spread without knowing!""
That literally spreading fear is. Making people fear unknown.

I done best make unknowns around virus known myself. AKA tried free ""Fear"" surrounding virus.

You gonna bring something heard table. repeating things heard time time sheep without ability question even things. Orange county CA always uses backlog excuse. matter look it, week week, month month, Florida surging. importantly, hospitals can't handle anymore. one measure gov came excuse away. understand flex that's 5 times make lol.

As far tell, study nothing going random shops testing people.

There mention representative screening group. appear relevant larger thread - think worth posting - think comment right place hang it.

Of note - testing appears existing samples already file Mount Sinai Hospital (I'm going abstract, immediately find actual article). Given aimed longitudinal study - drawing instanced data (such current proportion infected people) needs done care.

I'm dismissing challenging suggestion 20% infected population (at publication date) - throwing caution interpretation appears incidental results part aim study (as given title). would you’re down.

Because I've read articles topic doctors say that. need multiple vaccine candidates work we’re going vaccinate everyone go back normal. Oxford’s example stopgap vaccines early reports suggest temporary immunity. BioNTech ready December, cheap highly scalable vaccines like Imperial College’s reach poorest countries. CanSino (Chinese-Canadian) currently lead vaccines iirc see. seems sooner rather later cases spike second wave arrive Can't wait NY open back coronavirus explode again, causing another shutdown rando Instagram. lived another country, too. yeah I'm beginning think best scenario would tell everyone first round supplied mask placed nose/mouth 3-4 months daily. easy get full dose everyone try stay 10 feet away people avoid vaccine effective.

Apparently moving patients hospitals something happens kind COVID, think maybe probably moved patients northern California dozen times year. Post-COVID, we’re seeing fairly frequently, multiple times month, sometimes multiple times week,” according Cardenas.

And Bay hospitals fine Area hospitals generally low caseload, numbers increasing. out-of-county patients coming treatment, numbers beds could shrink quickly there’s post-holiday surge.

So still beds, patients still getting them. sometimes patients moved smaller hospitals larger ones, always happened, happening more.

But doesnt seem like ""people dying cant get hospital beds"", right?

I there, I'm guessing. know car dealership day, went corner away people partake ""Free"" coffee. course time lazy put mask away, let dangle one ear. photo taken moment time absolutely could looked like this. I'm religious wearing masks, I'm also cognizant possible use REAL photos tell whatever story want. Given Ted Cruz, likely thought rules story 100% accurate. albany county. I'm assuming ""beach"" little strip land touches Lake Michigan otherwise landlocked state. 1918 would lot worse made Chinese lab. know talk like knows politics? sounds like idea he's talking threatening withhold money people, something he's practicing decades. I’m still really confused moment. Part still reeling grandfather’s death two weeks ago. don’t want grandma die too... would mean everyone situation getting fully fucked over, make sense. point way around:


Whatever study decide take, good personally, might good professionally (but, yes, sure shot...).


I decided leave field computer 1995, study philosophy. working big bank time, making 60k year, everybody said crazy. (In way, was: job driving nuts...) studying, found application philosophical theory cryptology. 


Created company things fine.


So everybody wants study: go it, whatever field. Yeah doubt people sending kids public school built 750 students housing 1100 halls packed shoulder shoulder every class. Louisiana silently moving third per-capita cases larger states grab headlines. Seems like half people know gone go beach Florida. Democrats proposed additional $600/week addition actual unemployment benefit paid out. Republicans referring said that. logic working unskilled labor anything close minimum wage. approximately $7.50 hour, let's go $10 hour. make average $400/week(gross pay) assuming full-time work. minimum benefit already around $200/week tacking additional $600/week months. Suddenly, getting paid literally double staying home.

Businesses can't compete government level never meant able to. goal stimulus cover people, keep alive this, keep economy going nobody truly knows long affect things. pay people extra stay home, reason try even attempt find job anytime soon begin money siphoned system means replace long time. actually small businesses went extra trouble get funding keep people hired original intention keeping employees working food table, employees wound pissed owners due losing extra money laid collect unemployment benefit plus additional $600/week.

Hell, even engineer, could still make close 80% current gross wages unemployment work, based online benefit calculator. able rest brain go work \~3 months 20% paycut time able work projects meantime pretty sweet deal. sweet deal, find work afterwards, still even runs out, still receiving regular unemployment months minimum thus extra money buffer short while. least couple studies done recently masks, including material, many layers, much breathing resistance, can't find links now. Giogling brings recent media articles. anybody links studies?

And hell getting downvoted Every time hear “Medicare all” wish they’d make Medicaid. coverage much better private plans (and Medicare), helps much worry cost need treatment. I’m still trying get health managed enough work even reach point I’ll still keep hours income low enough stay Medicaid, since I’m many expensive meds can’t function without. Politicians actually suffering consequences actions? Unheard of. cousin lives immunocompromised dad grandma. believes everyone get covid sooner later. take precautions. He's pretty sure covid (fever, loss taste smell). passed along grandma, go ventilator bit. Thankfully, survived recovering. time, supposed go quarantine. see social medias, still going out, etc. Throughout this, seem care all. Still hanging friends, everything normally pandemic. wears mask work. month ago... saying widespread mask wearing would protect thousands came thread saying superstitious?

I'm not, I'm using logic ask, masks saving lives here, havent previously advocated for? prevent covid also prevent said, There’s reason can’t shouldn’t extend mask wearing flu protocol. 

Thank admitting probably temporary.  Different president too. Cable news less interested focusing negative live SC everything heading hell faster blink. governor two steps away half brain cell, ordering ""all bars must closed 11 curb spread covid"" ""we football fall continues"". welcome South Carolina, everyone. passengers flight take class action American Airlines &amp; Ted Cruz placing harm's way? Yes, vary strict (all time public vs. indoors), broad mandates boil ""wear mask leave house."" article, four days old: statewide face-covering orders include exceptions young children, people medical conditions could make wearing mask dangerous. key differences – chiefly, whether masks required indoors public states initially required people wear masks indoors recently expanded rules include outdoor public area physical distancing possible. Right, would mandate face masks nationwide enforce it. answer simple yet - done? American horrible. Empty exit row front me, man asked could sit (his whole row full) flight attendants didn’t let “those seats cost more”. mid flight another dude sat row, flight attendants asked seat, said no, let stay (but didn’t let original guy stay??). weeks ago  Remember borders racist? Meanwhile Michigan, we're arguments whether go mask free. We're r0 1.1.

It's still debate, completely different framework. feel South, especially tearing hair trying get neighbors mask up. Remember too, vaccine get, likely similar flu vaccine. It’s gonna 100% effective, likely gonna way lower risk getting virus, possibility contracting always there. like get flu vaccine, lowered risk contracting, doesn’t go zero. still stay peoples cough/sneeze zone, wash hands frequently, stay away know infections. Social distancing masks stay good. I'm glad northeast moment. Here's hoping close borders let us go back normal. tease... offer sounds good right now. Again, nursing homes could set COVID wings. Put COVID-positive patients one area, specific set staff. standard practice *even without Cuomo's actions*; nursing homes vulnerable community transmission, too.

And again, I've already pointed you, New York ""the lowest rate \[of nursing home deaths\] state country"". There's evidence worse states' approaches; fact, appears worked well. percent positive 15k day wasnt 9%. ""official"" percent 11.4% even that's correct. math tests reported vs cases 15%

Edit: testing value always higher make percents look lower. pay attention reported tests per case report lower say percent positive ratio that's part it. also eventually cases mass civil unrest unbounded growth. rewards worst character traits human causes class divides, suffering, resentment. inherently flawed system. I've read reports virus may early last Oct. may never get straight answer. Texas middle giant spike seems tailing least Houston surrounding Counties. We'll need couple weeks declines clear ICU beds. plenty beds emergency rooms full cant triage ICU beds quickly enough. bit cluster F really smart people making happen. Hence one lowest death rates. Texas come top eventually. trifecta Memorial weekend, BLM protest, July 4th weekend taken toll sure. Always idiots running around see masked days. Lol New York 2nd highest per capital mortality rate world, behind New Jersey, think good job? moron sent infected patients nursing homes caused thousands deaths. Fuck you. businesses dont give customers damn thing didnt pay pay mightily for. want what? Sympathy? Goodwill? Fuck outtahere. know chicken pox gives shingles later life. Covid-19 give us? even money growing trees. feds literally snapped fingers created $3 Trillion. ""how get paid"" debate going decades. Debt always around we'll always paying taxes. Like continue system fail anytime soon. disney reclose?  time hurricane season

shh....don't jinx us!

It surprising FL hit 2-3 Cat 5s season... Yup. Makes sense. wife works NYC DOE opening we're writing wills well. don’t believe NFL cares anything money, support fans games; believe municipalities stadiums situated permit it. incorrect. good getting specialized care, expensive care. However good care masses. Starving might exaggeration, crippling debt probably much common. Teachers barely scrap is. [Here’s also well-known cases patients testing positive months after. Could also explained failure fully clear begin with, something else; point don’t know enough sure reinfection isn’t possible. would nice voters would ban office. Basically IRL version “fuck around get dunked on” ex’s Texas people wonder many Americans don’t trust government politicians. Lol, 'under investigation'...

What way saying 'we anything time, going anything now.' Remember death sentence blamed NY? God he’s awful. dear Lock traitor ass up. they’re parties nothing happening them. Assuming you’re attending won’t get you’re hoping get sick. feel like take look mirror reflect disgusting human actually is. person party probably one wishing Illness people. Pathetic. Darwin awards. honestly want feel sympathetic this, can't. extreme rarity reinfection tell fears misplaced. weeks? Try couple months. Texas, Arizona, Florida late close, early open; bars open since May think.

Now they're taking sweet ass time reclosing things state wide. Looking union’s Facebook page, opposed opening person.

The OC board education, however, wants open without even basic safety precautions masks social distancing despite parent pushback, still voted favor opening immediately without them. normal. Experts yet agree whether children spread disease less. read studies support children less contagious well studies supporting children contagious. research insights needed point. stage anything less cautious. Risk reward price point acceptable 

I went bought n95 dust masks respirators classified site $10 per mask. patient samples used previous tests kept ice? fairly simple matter use genomic sequencing determine whether reinfection relapse.  Exactly Karen types seem extra layer persecution complex No. sacrifice lives to.

It's pretty simple. real circumstances, happen often, dead people vote. politician shamed lack mask use rest us must, get attention. Nobody wants get sick. Schools live open exactly two weeks - July 28th. *”Those die hospital rack average cost $32,379 last month life.” $300million single day, going someone’s pocket. almost everywhere synonym people suck power name patriotism Pet insurance friend. $10/month premium coverage, barely pay anything Wait, asking governor tried respond logically pandemic gotten praise governors straight murdering population? double majored biology physics (so usually 18-20 credit semesters) worked lab 3/4 years. loved college experience. worked super hard, physics group small got along really well. still fit extracurriculars (eg rode equestrian team great social group, too) loved studying.

And felt like lot time...but retrospect way less work master’s degree veterinary degree residency. Still liked those, too.

I remember undergrad adviser saying something like “In undergrad thought gee lot work, started grad school thought nothing lot work, became faculty...” Ergh. asking world start pandemic killing millions. 
You clearly American, explains extreme sensitivity. immunity **SYSTEM** goalpost. always combination many things including Bcells, Tcells, antibodies tested PCR. Antibodies always decline time. Cell Biologists always know this. There's article subreddit somewhere talks mentioned main topic. Unfortunately, opportunity find moment, either. I'll post later, unless someone else finds first.  No..the Rangers playing games year. 1. hits issue nuance. virus absolutely deadly claimed health systems overrun. run logical fallacies forecasting models.
Unfortunately we’re going relearn lessons Lombardy NYC Florida Texas. 

2. I’m sure happens, straightforward gap analysis deaths even glance pneumonia deaths shows opinion completely backwards. 
As analogy, it’s great convince someone wear seatbelt car. that’s going little good think going faster safer. 


3. Wearing mask help. it’s less effective avoiding high risk activities. damage done whose understanding current situation flawed (or even backwards) undo benefit marginal mask wearing might bring about. 15 days South Florida. Well that's... insane. California Texas mask mandates. Texas’ mandate recent, CA one ages, they’ve constantly locked least strict NY. yet, cases keep rising. Whoopsie... try again. 

25% NYC back April source: study need 43% herd immunity: Maryland big spike. wear full face respirator since that’s like thing works. dystopian headline! Alternatively could know, strike? Resign? Take pick. Nobody's making teach. Yup. Unfortunately, right. Ooof, you’re right. That’s big one don’t respond to.  think fused together one big mega Karen Honestly retrospect Trump Wuhan'd NYC. remember considering one point decided it, believe advice Dr. Failsee  mask mandate? Schools closed currently right?

No mask mandate state level, though counties pushing themselves...

The state mandated schools open person education fall (August) - though many counties saying follow mandate (and continue virtual learning)...and factor Federal level saying schools physically open subject loosing federal funding...

&amp;#x200B;

...Florida special kind messed situation - economy largely based tourism/hospitality, state income taxes - another slow shut may result bankruptcy require Fed level assistance hand got lives.....  guess finally found use giant pile FEMA coffins [New well US casualties (military civilian) US conflicts since second world war combined. couple outliers days believe... metro area population dense NYC major international airport sick Europeans flood into. Right, like basic math question: report's positivity rate lab wrong bunch positive column negative column, positive number right missing large number negative reports? I'd like think herd immunity possible 100-200 years time (3-4 generations worth) Yeah, except “government” profits people mindset, struck safer home order, followed lots loud yelling foot stomping mere mention mask mandates. 

Watching mews now, current infection rate nearly 9%. cases going every day, setting record record. daughter works restaurant host/server, I’m scared death her, needs money do? cautious wears mask gloves, washes sanitizes hands constantly, it’s still dangerous. many idiots going eat going bars like everything normal. Wow, I'd forgotten soon mentioned nostalgic shiver dread. *are* bizarrely high, I'm sure many people shoot die stalls decided leave easy access whoever installed absolute perv likes tour bathrooms regular. Or, suppose giving benefit doubt, someone really incompetent installed tiny doghouse doors bathroom stalls. Upside-down. bright side, property cheap Idaho get whole lot cheaper. fairness though, countries populations 10 million higher we're 3rd tests per capita.  numbers suck we're bad job handling this, numbers really tell complete story. Target’s minimum wage like $15/hr now. Change jobs. Last one voted work well? lose federal funding dont follow bureaucrats. Many schools basically rely federal funds stay open. basically open stay closed forever them. believe smiles weird UK like lol can't afford keep out, need trade deal. 

So there's ""mandatory"" 14 day quarantine basically one respecting. worried country crumbling, subscribe right

Ohhhweee. right oh oh mean left sorry mean subscribe right. 

Why believe this? I'm young see point going back forth. I'm assuming person African descent regards going see world same. let fear support system oppresses others feel safe. see mess we're right pandemic? Things change. Precisely. looking lady day. already illegal shit. &amp; Richard Burr. Gov. DeathSentence isn’t Ted Cruz zodiac killer. Hey smart guy, Texas one lowest death rate Covid is. Give guys credit keeping lot people alive NE states. Make exit next flight. family can’t afford Obamacare plan either, even maximum subsidy (I check every year.) deductibles affordable plans high ($6900) we’d paying insurance company privilege paying pocket. California expanded Medicaid, think we’ll lose coverage state finds we’re married.   haha comments always make moderating little better, thank reason Sweden high numbers no-lockdown, getting caught early huge influx measures place + lot old people clustered nursing homes got hit pretty hard. Well maybe full lockdown would lowered numbers somewhat would still high compared neighbouring countries. need opposites. Confirming link means connection, mean causation. Covid spread neighbours parents, parents neighbours linked me, tertiary spreader. parents spread neighbours, neighbours linked parents. 

It's careful word choice since linked order things linked together implies causation without writers saying anything wrong. source known right leaning news outlet high fact credibility, also noted rhetoric (emotive language, leading language) push political agenda -- saying linked letting readers assume causality exactly MO. Winter coming. Wait, children become vectors COVID-19? able to! normally file disputes online, could also call CC company explain! Mine February too. I'm Idaho keep making front page awful reasons. sad see many fellow idahoans give Covid 19. Schools never open here. ""Investigation""? statutory requirement wear damn' mask, clearly seen everyone wearing one. hell investigate?

Mind you, he's senator, he'll get scot-free.

Recall George W. Bush's granddad, senator Prescott Bush, attempted military coup president Roosevelt, committed *treason*, got free pass. Cruz safe, imagine. Except airlines kind monopoly. Depending route times need take, might choice.

It free market. put effort dragging Fauci mud actually listening putting proper plan action keep country safe. could donate [directly “Hey Beth, minimum wage flight attendant, didn’t tell one powerful republican senators country something opposed first place company received ton bailout money boss?” Unless Rey, case, carry on. No, literally said lied useless order guarantee supply hospitals.

The government power straight seize goods public good, absolutely need lie public, *because could've fucking seized masks regardless public's perception usefulness*.

They knew better lied. wonder anyone considered could picture pre-pandemic ?  cases young people states protest 3-4 weeks protest ""we cannot link cases protest"" . Washington state, outbreak nursing facility signaled pandemic's arrival United States. Now, nearly half new coronavirus cases Seattle area showing 20s 30s, according recent analysis state data.

It blows mind people still try defend protests outside okay, wonder people would ok open air sports arenas, music festivals, outdoor bar/grills, large beach/lake gatherings, parks packed 1,000s people wanted fun Saturday afternoon.

Even knew 100% certainty sunlight instantly inactivated virus still huge amount risk peripheral activities protest like sharing car, stopping gas station fill car fuel, using uber/lyft, going public transport, meeting friends, passing somebody water bottle, placing hand park bench go sit, etc. Arizona right behind them!!! reference? seen picture mask old one information blood type playing role again, he's pretending exist, would hurt narative caught it, could see 50/50 respond heh. heartbreaking developmentally inappropriate young kids! That’s crazy, albeit anecdotal, statistic. Stay safe! We’re going need multiple vaccine candidates work we’re going vaccinate everyone though go back normal, especially Oxford vaccine mainly stopgap vaccines. doesn’t fully prevent disease give long term immunity, weaken give people chance escape. BioNTech ready December Imperial iirc (which highly cheap scalable) millions early next year 92 deaths Arizona. Going grim day death count fear. Perhaps worst while. Yes. paper true. practice guarantee mean shit military would pull coup something size. debate awhile back another issue, Trump postulating something high up, abruptly backed incident disappeared. nowhere near size selling state literally purpose military operations. comes Alaska, gonna big fat no.  would even confirm someone contracted cash interacting infected person gave cash? I'm one people think vaccines mandatory, unless accredited doctor says can't one legitimate, medical reasons. reason better ""my religion says wrong."" Or, ""They're poison"" whatever. acceptable reason would be, ""I autoimmune disorder, can't vaccine else body freak hurt overreacting vaccine."" shell game? guess would military, highest risk, essential, everyone else.

And likely rich people everyone else. Oh know. Tied Evers hands plan. (R) way. It'll drive state (and country) right cliff. Exactly right. saw headline well, ludicrous figure. Please, wear mask, people. expect solve problem. I'd like thank citizens UK making Americans look like great tourists. joke. lived Idaho 10 years ago. claimed Overpayment unemployment, error. something around 800$. I've living another state since then. Last week received lean threat mail Idaho 2400$ this. WTF wrong state. Many sites keep capitalization- also anticipate spending real amounts time here. lol

Wrong counts !remindme two weeks mzzyhmd -40°F thing. getting made number?

Hell Florida, ""pneumonia deaths"" %500...that's fucking COVID, COVID often kills people pneumonia - they're suppressing numbers, inflating them.  exactly DeSantis thinks happens next? scenario lose-lose airline. want anti-maskers Republicans boycotting airline action Ted Cruz, want pro-maskers Democrats boycotting airline failing deal Ted Cruz. vet told shell game. p wont make watch lifelong learners leave school Would pretty dumb strategy considering Texas really play people sub assuming bad faith? agenda except learn find best solution.

Testing basically doubled since April, infections since June tripled. going long summer US; there's sign great divide whether protect vulnerable, allow herd immunity let God sort out, ever going end.  anecdotes I've encountered suggest surface infection deliver sufficient innoculatory dose cause severe disease, however even proves true, likely someone touches surface rubs nose still infect others even mild case symptoms lasting week. saves others, therefore everyone must wear useless !remindme seven weeks likely point. Keep idiots Canada. Bunch selfish narcissistic people. Enjoy corona state 2022 idiots. seriously something would like backpedal quickly?

The average temp mach April Stockholm was: 3 5 C. Hardly warm pleasent NO. reason. Far evidence support reinfection “As far know, hasn’t documented case reinfection,” told Gizmodo. 

She scroll like 3 paragraphs article. person testing twice almost *four months apart* isnt evidence reinfection, would count evidence?

Best case scenario virus hung around guy months suddenly put hospital multiple times... great news, right?

People need drop normalcy bias understand serious is.

Edit: There's also this: may airtight evidence reinfection, enough evidence prove virus outlier many disturbing first 3 months COVID-19 pandemic, COVID-19 expected immunizing non-relapsing disease. report national case series 11 virologically-confirmed COVID-19 patients experienced second clinically- virologically-confirmed acute COVID-19 episode.  Firstly parents shouldn’t screamed you.  

You wrong, right either.  Sometimes adults self destructive things, checking them, offering support, small measured amount advice, cannot make right thing.  might right might right anyway.  cannot walk path another person.  breaking law, *endangering people* cannot make things way want.  

Since grandma endangering herself, you, presume she’s breaking pandemic rules area, can’t make parents protect herself.  behaviour could really scary sad you.  You’re allowed tell that.  

One thing might going despite old people really wanting live, spouse dies long standing relationship, spouse often loses live.  Even pandemic many elderly couples die within short timespan other.  

I hoping lives, yet would take opportunity tell good memories grandpa, her.  Tell favourite things her, favourite things him.  Sharing stories dead loved ones moderates grief much.  unique opportunity next weeks tell everything wish said dies.  case. Exactly. unrealistic - mention unfair - expect elderly immunocompromised stay indoors indefinitely. larger portion us preexisting conditions lot people understand, too.

Like wear mask, people! requires almost sacrifice part!

*But muh rights!* performance poor. I’m convinced poor performance rises level recall impeachable offense. 

This understand. reporting covid true, people dying place, sufficient reach level recall impeachable offense? They’ve done “research” Facebook, blogs YouTube, none actually read studies besides context snippets. unfortunately come contacts lot anti-vaxxers irrational fear vaccines, doctors fierce need protect kids. Unfortunately one mom friends got sucked vaccinating, tried reasoning didn’t vaccinate infant daughter caught whopping cough hospitalized month suffered terrible cough months. vaccinates again. Compassion goes long way really wanting protect kids scared thinking vaccines dangerous viruses protect against. safe place Covid infection Peruvian Andes.

That's ultimate strike. fucking moron. disgusting parasite. Concern troll. Unless entirely airborne, cash potential vector, surfaces. scientists know 100% airborne sure transmitted larger droplets case, cash possible vector again, surfaces possible vectors. Nope lol black cloth says lot CA regulations northeast, virus hit hard, people take lessons heart. shows *people* care enough take precautions need regulations. Regulations mean nothing people still parties taking precautions. last week, though Humanity... truly doomed. can't claim huge things like without scientific papers sources. Literally conservative politics (I’m USA) right now. 

Conservative economic policies basically rooted “I got mine, don’t want give single thing anyone else. need work hard like me”.

Every time see someone wanting defund education, healthcare, welfare programs - makes sick. type person purely short sighted self centred reasons state. Agreed. I’m trying come response tells doesn’t get fired. not.

There's even lady actively coughing photo...   That’s kind thinking. Like, they’ve kept employee health insurance stopped paying boosted unemployment started up. that’s due run soon, know they’ll need pay keep long term people board (which, need, they’re massive boost parks), might well bring people work make safe. Serious question. headlines I’ve seen report evidence lung damage seen even people display external symptoms. 8 know lungs checked verify damage? I’m actually sure one would tell lung damage. I've heard people saying scares crap me. Yea I'w heard entire sweden (me included) found shity eldery care is, even though equipment available ""only"" recomendation use them.

My girlfriend norwegian, talked Mother works eldery care norway. told use kind equipment standard time, everything already ready use covid came norway.

I know dont agree swedish strat Great strat, im sure possible sweden pull off, I'w never really thought sweden ""had shit together"" im bit confused som many country seems disapointed, expecting more.

That said, think executet ""swedish strat"" poorly, imagin terrible would executed lockdown...

Edit: sorry wierd typos... Seems Phone love randomly capitalise letters switch swedish/norwegian fun... learned applied rest country. 

I furiously broken-hearted this. 

In early days shutdown, sat home working, huddled desk 5 blocks Elmhurst Hospital, hearing every siren go past. One things gave grim hope city's pain would warning states go were. 

I personally lose anyone, people know did. People know lost jobs (I took pay cut). 

We canary coal mine, people squandering lead gave them. New York second highest death rate compared others states, first one New already 20% false negatives - turn around time two weeks prevents retesting I'm sure mean poverty wage. 43k year close $20.67 hour work every single weekday year. Dallas Houston, get 1 room apartment avout $1200/m, 2 room apartment $1500/m. come $14.4k $18k year respectively. Even paying health insurance ($100), new car ($400), car insurance ($150), utilities ($200), food ($300), expenses (let's say $300). that, still get pocket $150 taxes all.

And I'm high balling that. get new car little $275 month, food go $150 month cook, nearly doubled health insurance.

Now kids add another layer finances I'm going get into, that's far poverty wage. factory Malaysia. real roads near it. footpaths.

Leave cities Malaysia dirt poor. Yeah unfortunately would come federal government. unconstitutional states restrict travel. Sometimes, die even get chance change mind: way, unconstitutional. don’t need set precedent. think argument ""plight working class parent"" absurd. Yes, understand difficult position. Everyone gets that. pandemic put us difficult situations.

But attitude essentially hey gotta work guess children society's problem like *then get me, man.* 

Honestly problem work culture anything else, I'm always #1 person criticize work culture. wanna criticize suggest country lock sure, agree you. cool ""my kids gonna get virus whether like not"" crusade. understand wanting pay full price was. Lots people much that. don’t get point? saying higher rates testing done beginning US last 7-14 day window?

Or saying Brazil’s testing ramped last 7-14 days skews all-time average actually testing appropriate rates now? second thought followup covid found semen. I’m talking organizing, something seem lack critical understanding of. pitch money teachers go fundme decide go work. Saw posted May yet enter clinical trials, typical New York second highest death rate compared others states, first one New healthcare workers stuck mask since March whatever. idea country in, still PPE shortages regions. Russia beat us first person space, they’re gonna beat us vaccine ?  Well problem fucking bad now, real cure could worse testing match pandemic population. US still higher positive test rate compared countries means still testing enough people. What's fuckin' investigate???

Fcking imbeciles. difficult class, take what's point? No, REAL problem taking mask (the way photographed off) exceptions care peoples health lives. no, care airlines policy is. negate science. Considering around 85% deaths 65+ category, focusing telling older people stay home come contact anyone instead telling millenials they're committing genocide going beach? Younger middle aged people hurt this. They're losing jobs school futures destroyed. Seniors get free money healthcare existing worry aforementioned things. 85% less deaths, things would look lot less worse. Ah, we’re playing reindeer games see. must type person said “the flu kills people year” covid deaths recorded month in. NY &amp; NJ got hit HARD BEGINNING. What’s excuse TX, AZ, FL, etc.? daily rates increasing huge fucking rate? Oh right, don’t believe wearing mask &amp; social distancing. 

And don’t give bullshit number deaths &amp; death rate NY/NJ dealt virus knowing fuck kills people. deal thinking problem lungs find people literally fucking dying blood clots fucking information it.We lived shit learning go. we’re still learning virus, sure shit know hell lot treat rest country. may lives saved hot spot states information didn’t beginning. tell ignore facts. Governors hotspot states deserve taunted refuse anything save people. 

The reason 40% deaths northeast far states getting started. nothing anything government did.

You sound like Trump back Feb - ""there lots deaths Italy, none here. win!"" kids, you. Try homeschool kids talk ""free child care"". stupid comment really annoys me.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wait October even November rolls around. There’s clear pattern resurgence areas seeing extreme heat south, driving people indoors air conditioning. New York may much rougher time cold comes back. Compare today last Tuesday Tuesday shit's us content sit idly stage set. Almost twice high, per capita, california average days. 

A state twice population. work average joes department public works, average joe myself.

Trump fool trying keep average joe blue collar demographic happy, pay come election.

He thinks ones voted haven’t changed minds, tell many blue collar minds changed good.

I tell first hand average joes beginning turn trump condemning choice makes Abbott DeSantis idiots, DeSantis another level. 6 weeks probably conservative, AZ peak earlier far ahead Florida terms total cases per capita, TX 50% way That’s going make anti-vaxxers dig — applying much pressure make really believe Bill Gates hid microchip injection.

We may live slow, gradual adoption vaccine. Ironically may see higher adoption make clear vaccine voluntary, even though don’t think be. hate we're point see headline, like 'of course to'. remember horrified read needing New York, reading articles otherwise unemployed lay-people paid sling bodies day. reading rising cases, diminishing hospital beds, new hard lockdowns, feels like horrifying less logical step. that's awful. again, point fact conversation Fauci?

I seriously get tangent tried take talking one person known salary. way around, work like that, also came say this. Agreed. two dogs probably think quarantine best thing ever happen. lot early studies intense selection effects, like initial Santa Cruz survey, antibody tests 1-3% false positive rates (whatever reason).

You deal high false positives still get reasonably accurate picture, signal swamps noise - area heavily infected. expect common cold exposure last however-many-years remarkably unevenly distributed.

 make think little bit? Even teeny weeny itsy bitsy bit trump really is? like want Americans coming over.  Go Florida Man! likely. immune acted within scope offices committing fraud. moon landings fake! earth Flat! virus fake! can't trust educated! many kids dying? deaths covid related? unsafe assume recovered patients neither catch spread it

I seen news reports someone catching again. share? complain closing threat snow, yet want go full steam full hospitals even get started may resort cans ""Perri-air"" fresh clean air keeps up. 😄 Whaddabout. know right? crazy people Good maybe learn something NE.

Also, check lead-time issues. many cases testing way earlier NYS able beginning. Florida seeing 27 day lead-time positive cases deaths.

Damn I'm PI guess work wrong agency. us make maybe 120k live suburbs appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Assuming FL Governor currently playing ""rational"" game sucking Trump's ass - he'll continue charade RNC August, try squeeze much political favor cash tourism possible time...then hopefully press conference he'll throw arms air say ""Who could've known?"", hopefully semblance another shelter place, seal Florida while, get Fed assistance FL near bankruptcy without tourism/hospitality prop economy (especially winter season/high season coming up).... assumptions though....

The really sad part Florida could've mitigated majority, this, used slower tourism period (late spring - summer) handle (longer shelter place, state level mask social distance mandates, etc) good position open tourism winter (high season)...but wait bag marshmallows settle single mini marshmallow opening early, fast.... piece shit highly responsible pandemic. early lies masks destroyed response. tried Trump treason.

You seem understand lag case results deaths. day place shuts still expect cases climb next 10-14 days higher end caught slowly develop symptoms. Additionally, spreads within family groups helps continue elevate case numbers lock down. cases peaked 2-3 weeks lockdown started decreasing afterward.

Also, mask policies group size restrictions aren’t different plenty states seeing cases spiking now

They *absolutely* different. Many states getting hit hard right (Texas, Florida, Arizona, etc.) state wide mask mandate, businesses blatantly breaking seating distance guidelines, populations taking virus seriously. Fricken' Disney World open going try argue New York City similar guidelines Florida right facts don’t support you’re saying all.

Fuck Kemp. opposite doing...... mechanism place actually enforce that..  hope every faculty, staff, students, visitors hold accountable call people wearing mask properly since required now. also know that's wishful thinking observe around me, people usually mind business. Remember - Russian. United NEVER admit mistake.

Tried fly Newark Hong Kong years ago. snow storm domestic flights cancelled, international still flying. start takeoff (3 hours late, totally fine) plane blows something engine immediately abort taxi back gate. get us new plane, 6 hours original takeoff time announce they’re flying us San Francisco instead get us new crew cuz point can’t fly full distance. tell us it’ll 2 hour turn around time get SFO way. 

We take off, great mostly empty flight SFO. They’re handing lot drinks, extra ice creams, pilot tells us several times compensated inconvenience. IMMEDIATELY upon landing, it’s 3am SF time, announce they’ve cancelled second half flight. clear plan along, would rather ship everyone different part country fill half full flight Hong Kong. 

They refused apologize, refused put anyone hotel everyone went fucking ballistic. gave maybe 20 vouchers people ended spend night airport. 

The supervisor straight told boyfriend wasn’t United’s fault flew us 6 hours way cancel flight immediately upon landing. offered us $200 voucher, tried claim told valid claim number. 

United fucking sucks, refuse fly ever again. Coronavirus shares concern... ask Julian Ricky! Neither methods found work iirc; using hydrogen peroxide gas is/was one ways sterilize mask without reducing efficiency.

Edit: stated article, UV also found work well without ruining masks understand; sorry citations hand. That’s assumed. wanted make sure. They’ll getting dog car won’t going mean still top states total deaths per capita total cases per capita. az tommorow. Children least vulnerable disease. wouldn’t surprised likely die influenza. Yea, sure hear social media. Cause know, usually rely radio information here. Colored TVs entered country last year. However, 80% population can't afford though, oh poor us. Excuse me, go ride donkey back home :'( . Get fuck outta man hahahahaha. millionaire Qatari something? Hahahahaha jesus fuck, thick you? one strongest lockdowns world months, coupled contact tracing, one comes abroad, vigorous testing. expect? virus keep self generating. fucking hate pandemic got every fucking layman speak like scientist now, read ""journal articles"". think Danish health authorities “fucking dumb”? advice. people following it. Mask usage 2-5 percent DK public settings, isn’t practical follow proper mask protocol.

And gotta say going significantly better using technique US. Duuude, can't say large indigenous population problem. Yup, phase 3 trials compressed is, seems like maxing around 3 months regardless numbers Scandinavian neighbors? Still diligently avoiding comparisons them, wonder why... young friends bailing teaching state it.

All according plan.

There's reason education system southern states robust rest nation. lie. went walk single mother 49, 9yo daughter. talked went walk park. sat said “I living mom would like move see works out. don’t want work need get together awhile. “ also don’t intend sex marriage go church now.” shock. walked car haven’t talk since. mean hot 30yo would consider well, beautiful woman around nice. 49? better fucking delight least clean house work.... hate dating. Wait, saying hate capitalism? /s nightmare , teen infecting parents grandparents immuno-compromised family members stresses . upon time even CDC staff embedded China.

And diplomatic relations diminished. true. Also percent positive isnt 15% 20% (take number tests today subtract yesterday's divide cases number)  went well Denmark. around 140 cases back then, leas 40 now. No, discussion challenge trials subjects intentionally exposed, company decided take on. placebo vaccine groups go lives researchers look number infections group. Don’t bother, he’s typical rightie persecution complex. totally get hype, ""more (except"" ""more all"" - hate stupid hyperbolic shit. Statements like headline seek nothing get clicks. Stupid. not. Thinking everyone die ventilator wrong. practice medicine Sweden like even normal circumstances. may disagree make right. want thank American neighbours running experiment there. 

I like think they're make running phase 3 efficacy tests vaccines easier.

America leading way again. God bless patriots. :'( really? I'd wait see independent lab based reviews say jumping in. wish llama goalpost moving? always stored immunity. long-term immunity is. shy put steel man exercise you’re forced argue position opponents one valuable practices imo.

For example, I’m pretty left leaning, would say think best argument conservatives make universal healthcare (which completely support) is: “the federal government historically super inefficient incompetent technology implementations, would universal healthcare different” 

I think that’s great debate have. Instead drone able fund universal healthcare really bad argument since private healthcare system expensive universal healthcare system far, already universal healthcare system works great (for people 65). None old ass people marching streets defund Medicare they? 

Also republicans longer make conservative argument since apparently OK increasing spending Obama ever also super incompetent job. See previous comment third-hand sources. Idiot charge place near best world COVID? 81801 PCR tests resulting 3.4% positivity. pooling testing performed currently Sweden. fans go NFL allow it? Because, sadly, definitely know people would still go allowed. I’m pro anything tbh, I’m amused Reddit’s unwavering conviction Sweden committing reckless genocide Russian media well known critical political leaders 🙄 comparing time testing percentages instead last 7-14 day window.

You spinning truth fit beliefs. I've heard South Fla hospital leaders -- point -- main concern shortage actual bed space, equipment, ventilators. issue staff. (nurses, doctors, etc.) exhausted worked pandemic months need relief.  state sending 100 nurses Jackson Health help. sure exactly arrive. Well didn’t age well, lmao US include ""probable cases"" count.

This [from &amp; Probable Counts**

As April 14, 2020, CDC case counts death counts include confirmed probable cases deaths. change made reflect interim COVID-19 position statement pdf iconexternal iconissued Council State Territorial Epidemiologists April 5, 2020. position statement included case definition made COVID-19 nationally notifiable disease. Nationally notifiable disease cases voluntarily reported CDC jurisdictions.

A confirmed case death defined meeting confirmatory laboratory evidence COVID-19.

A probable case death defined one following:

- Meeting clinical criteria epidemiologic evidence confirmatory laboratory testing performed COVID-19
- Meeting presumptive laboratory evidence either clinical criteria epidemiologic evidence
- Meeting vital records criteria confirmatory laboratory testing performed COVID19

Not jurisdictions report confirmed probable cases deaths CDC. available CDC, noted N/A. 3 months. live major city 43k would poverty wages. Yup, live WI, too. TV market, actually. Yes. necessary travels 14 days quarantine required. Working together best solution, often people fail realize it. someone living Florida, makes happy!! live smaller town, fucks seem think “oh, won’t happen here.” believe guy Facebook saying “I drove hospitals &amp; looked normal me!” 

and every day local news reporting 90 new cases new deaths always try discredit saying “oh, well underlying conditions” “well 70 anyways” 

the people comment shit Facebook town pure fucking cancer society cases, reduced collection efficiency N95 respirators certification level 95 per cent.

Reducing effectiveness mask render unusable. options autoclaved mask mask autoclaved mask clearly best choice even filters 70% cleaning process. think result public policy coordination federal provincial governments resultant buy-in enough population make work. Anti-COVID rallies (in Manitoba, least) tiny compared US cities. hard justify attacking right wing premier (that's like governor America) he's less following lead set Trudeau, centrist prime minister. 

Also, extremists conspiracy nuts here, they're (so far) much less influential America. version Fox News/OAN, etc, silly website called *The Rebel*, nobody matters takes seriously. correct. spring relatively cold late. three weeks warm weather June, July uncommonly cold wet. last two weeks we’ve temperatures around 15 degrees daily showers quite bit thunder Stockholm region. Boy, would know kid raise comes take life years later. different kinds safe.

I’m sure candidates made far safe doesn’t immediately obvious consequences.

What different vaccines long-term safety profile unknown. Yeah may never infected antibody tests inaccurate. think so? hope everyone smart enough know couple thousand worth long term risk Vox article click-bait crap. See discussion actual science subreddit r/COVID19.  That's generous interpretation NIMBY, usually pejorative. definition NIMBY may unfazed halfway house near school another neighborhood -- they'll damned going next gym!

Yeah, they're using freezer trucks. wouldn’t say I’m setting aside, that, is. Much South East done first wave except includes dear Philippines... hay..... Canada 5 major political parties number smaller ones. certainly ways system could improve definitely allows greater representation interests ideas federal level. bad virus can't take ones asking it. Coronovirus forefront many publications starting January.

The word there, people ignoring it. ""common cold"" ridiculous umbrella term use different rapidly mutating respiratory viruses, coronaviruses (like ""Some animals mammals""). Masks would much cheaper Ugh, realize bad Texas. Right work state, indeed. pension mean much dead though.  Maybe actual change happen people realize nothing lose life. like there's abundance up-and-coming teachers former teachers looking scabs jobs teachers start dying start striking. one actually english, understand it. many people liking this, even good comment. timmy, left paint chips chew on, mom going beach 4 ratchet friends. safe, love you!  Look, send couple dudes flags. We'll provide rest. That's good way see everyone going get sick early... Maybe save teachers lives early shutdowns elsewhere kept seeing problem things opened back up. grew PBC. believe you. historical data trend (for last several months) says anything...wait Saturday/Sunday peak, Mon-Wed almost always trough.... keep sanity, better look weekly averages Pay good I’m at. Meanwhile Florida: let's reopen Disney, send kids back school, host RNC Jacksonville (the #6 rising spot FL). state guys (these states) learn.

It took 3 weeks find available time slot grandmother's funeral. remember hearing "" mystery virus"" china way back November December , government nwn sooner . issue lack understanding virus's existence, failed response virus's existence. work, paid, waiting test results. Turn around time? 7 10 days. dropped /s I'm LI. Risk low here. I've back work weeks mostly see people wearing masks following social distancing rules. Sorry, article much place consider good source issue. Especially since, again, common theme word ""intensive"" gets left that's turns subject. also seems third-hand information best. source closer topic question?  think teacher's unions strike/walkout. give big FU school districts backs piece trash Betsy Devos Block her, dude. helped immensely get breakup, pandemic. ...what!?  possible distance? lot easier mask rather taking seriously adopting/adjusting?

Apart work haven’t situation couldn’t distance in, place looked crowded I’ve chosen go / use service. 1918 parade = lesson learned. Originally said got 120 last time Europe. I'm European never really made dent here. got contained early probably Asia even much exposure. ""fuck you, dont tell do"" mentality country. ingrained history blood. people CANT come together unlikely allow people travel recent PCR test complete mystery though. Chinese living US. I’ve wearing cotton masks since end February. shocked experts said masks required sick caring sick person early mid-March.

I Hong Kong SARS face masking immediate 100% long time. one said didn’t work. respiratory virus broke out, everyone knew home Asian friends - Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai masked right away.

It’s kind laughable say misinformation save masks doctors nurses got call parents week Valentines Day begging prepare spent week looking masks n95s hardware stores surgical masks pharmacies city surrounding suburbs. live sleepy Midwest stores totally bought then, mention online. no-mask “advice” came weeks far late save mask supply then. snow birds, it’s tacky Florida. roughly. Sticking plan measures maintained long time. Years necessary. totally right Trump forcefully disperse peaceful protesters National Guard. Completely different. vote authority school district decisions. It’s individual districts. Thanks fully, district emailed right away they’re following state California Guidelines. doubt public schools actually open without mask requirements. 16.2%, still high. COVID messed Texas. COVID ... Oooh that's cool Look, know; know 'investigation' almost certainly means 'figure manage PR', realize we're talking almost certainly wearing mask. I'm saying alternative explanations. Yeah. That’s countries doing. NY authority it, not? entirely speculation. Palm Beach County, NEVER time roads clear shopping centers empty. one day. Germany handling outbreak differently US is. would naive assume generalize results world large. Yeah, problem major reason start recommend people won’t get beaten?

They recommend don’t drink much alcohol. People way. don’t recommend masks people still going use them. Haha, thanks. pc would link top fifty causes death. look see state high number one day often pass years total deaths several newsworthy conditions.

Florida going get worse gets better I'm afraid got return alright 1.5 million died TB last year. masks TB pandemic? feel you. kids thought pain ass making wash hands. glad deal school aged children pandemic. indifferent news.

This seriously important subject need information current information indicates possibility. least, doctors know need look heart disorders patients hospitalized covid. Ignoring risks patient sudden heart failure recovery. 55% insignificant chunk group.

We seriously need know millions people US require follow care, possibly years, help them.

And, yes, covid patients need know possibility. get follow care know look for. Brushing leads complacency kill people. Thanks! James Bourne. great news! hope malaysia continues positive news! 

my grandma finally able fly back home malaysia weekend stuck Australia since April, i'm glad see malaysia well! Im confused swedish people wear face masks social distance public resturaunts/bars...meanwhile US facing crisis Florida/Texas/California without ICU beds hospital beds left 

The US, extent swedish approach. consequences far deadlier US caused health care system verge collapse..

Why sweden suffering consequences without wearing masks/not social distancing bars/resturaunts?

It make sense all. problem. Discounting effects severe economic damage make problem go away. live US you’re rich, probably won’t access vaccine right away, watch goes 1%, ok get it, probably too. OP's article clearly showed airline mask policy. honestly don’t understand waiting week. Alaska Airlines best go everywhere Air force required wear masks uniform Statistics seems 8-10 days infection ventilator average. Yes enough. people told needed wear masks would bought loads anyway even told make own, would meant even less healthcare workers big problem April May. UK government behave even slightly like Trump administration comparisons ignorant lazy. really think give shit mask industry anyway? like supporting tech financial sector. largely opportunism pass pandemic. It’s €1/hr. 😐 say, expensive poor. They're keeping wages down, they're increasing cost living. people know made poor choices (influenced predatory lending agents, people actually deserve ""discipline"") mean everybody's spending wildly frivolous things. Thank you, stay safe also. might cut some... hour downtime single production line usually 5-10k lost revenue. Yeah daughter comes year visit July 7th. uncomfortable attending airport. 

By way, 9 wore mask entire flight Midwest west coast. save redditors time: South Carolina seems US state closest number citizens Scotland. Maybe American thing, feeling one go bars, one missing life? could go hiking safely, meet outdoors masked distance safely, picnic safely. many ways, rather going bars drinking. alcohol consumption glamorized American western nations, movies. dating apps meet people safely. ""It would disincentive go back work"" - Republicans

Even work fucked response bad need shut economy again. Georgia get deal? Privatized small company founded 6 weeks ago 15 employees owned close personal friend President Trump.

I'm guessing know that's pretty much going play out. Orange County embarrassment rest Southern California. place groups Karens protesting able get haircuts get nails done couple months ago. They've routinely flaunted governor's mandates recommendations could help prevent spread virus. think they're going find kids transmit parents fine, contrary board's belief. Ah yes, that. heard while, complete bullshit. Take $1200 blood money go crying courts grandpa dies brought home covid minimum wage job. American. Imagine someone constantly tell *complete assholes* flip spit put mask on? shit pay? I'd give too. sure cold viruses things like herpes pull.my mask &amp; start coughing around people. apologize saying hard cough mask on. 
Or light cigarette right outside door. Maybe inside, rights smoke violated too? Sorry, mobile. 

[Here Existing antibody tests useless 1% population infected, infected people got virus previous two weeks.

They're useless 20% population infected.

""Not even 50% accurate"" misunderstanding false positive false negative rates. ...and great Florida moms like - head back school Timmy, mommy needs quiet Facebook/Instagram/Twitter time.... benefit is, remove one glove use phone pay shopping, don’t touch anything car door glove free hand. avoid cross contaminating phone needing clean it. thinks main I’d miss **Why states surging coronavirus cases experiencing high death rate?**

Florida 282k cases New York 428k cases, yet New York 8x deaths Florida currently has. discrepancy? There's ban recommend either. Unless changed? many harassed even beaten wearing public. US needs effective response early detection. response purposed expand economy instead suppressing disease, earlier know, worse gets. No. want go summer houses Sweden hassle. Papa Trump said okay! 1% reasonable high end estimate. 3% not. Yes. Generally Democrats liberal leaning states, run liberals supportive wearing masks many cases mandated it. patriotism really looks like. Exactly not. hybrid model best shot *stability* 2020-2021 school year. Kids get in-person attention instruction need certain topics/subjects, online busy work compliment in-person experience. Lower student load created gapping (33% - 25% student body building time, 1-2 weeks) makes feasible serve lunch classrooms, social distance, safe. 

Y'all keep acting like go away lockdowns *it go away*. find ways live *in pandemic*. get this, fuckin shortcuts here. Normal coming back anytime soon, suck up, flexible, protect people, figure fuckin committing resources plan, parents staff plan much easier.

And kids get fucked entire year Zoom. country hates kids, god I’m Maine live Boston yes, everybody wearing masks, safe, working home result, gyms open, restaurants open things mostly normal now. Funny works can't even tell real quote anymore. Um, yes. That's lie. masks *only* sick people healthcare workers, mask mandates today?

&amp;#x200B;

Is because, possibly, there's *very* good reason healthy people wearing masks too? Whoa. countries got that. Many countries. Much earlier on. saw nowhere near case fatality have. almost like... countries looked SARS-COV-1 kinda just... used measures starting point. Whoa. Novel idea.

&amp;#x200B;

GTFO misinformation. knew asymptomatically spread *February* Diamond Princess incident (again, handled CDC US embassy). good idea long incubation period well. get probably taking time inform COVID situation time, using feelings tell people they're wrong. Figures.

&amp;#x200B;

We p*lenty enough* information say, ""Please save N-95 masks medical grade PPE medical professionals, *it's good precaution make wear cloth masks* mimic members. perfect protection, every little bit helps."" nothing else, model UK predicted *2.2 million people dying COVID.* good enough reason wear mask?

there's much unpack there. Shit. would too.  stability they've known maybe job love. tough choice people tend fearful change (especially like do). 

Going teacher Target stark contrast many teachers went profession love it. People quick jump bandwagon either direction, unfortunate education information never important. Clam down, click bait article. actually pro mask republican 

He removed mask drink coffee. least bit surprising. Ever heard quote ""never waste good crisis?"" Bingo! 'right work' laws NEVER challenged FEDERAL court much much much infirm legal grounds. 4 common cold coronaviruses (229E, NL63, OC43, KHU1) produce permanent antibodies confer sterilizing immunity. 

We idea one produces humans, sure going permanent like smallpox immunity. headsup- saw person arguing scientist I’m OC. board doesn’t authority school districts do. It’s “recommendations.” exist since don’t power? knows lol.

My district, Capistrano Unified, already emailed response saying following state guidelines. doubt public school district follows recommendation.

I think purely private schools want stupid go mask. US Canadian border staying closed least August Weird cuz public school teachers know southwest work second job afford rent roommates. Good Australia admitting saying protests COVID linked like USA. problem can't solved militarly priority America well outside field explained like this:
It's clear long term natural immunity going thing not. may/may able make vaccine given strain. However instances infection exist higher chances viral mutation different strains. Every cell virus gets tiny chance creating new unique strain. 1000 infected people likley get splitting strains, infect millions pretty likely.
There's real danger result tipping point infection countries new strains pop faster sort immunity could develop, thus recycling new versions disease population akin common cold flu (which new vaccine formulation year even guarantee get sick strain designed for.)

The big issue let get beyond specific critical mass given area could establish permanently.

The end game situation likely going citizens countries curb stomp fast enough may well looking perminant travel bans rest world. Can't save economy dead friend, lives need come first unless we're Florida. say 0.02% x 74 million kids 18 = 14,800 kid coffins get 215? usually 193 196 even convict

We could have. Senate chose to. Big difference. perfect bone structure mask... could taken chance hide chin/neck transition. RIP Texas let ice cold Corona expire! 140 million?! 🙏 think people like bored. way convince vaccinations bad new world order coming Jesus returning destroy civilization unless nothing else going on. think got 20th rewatching Office, realized life empty, sought something keep mind busy ended black hole stupid. exactly DeVos wants, people pull kids public schools. “school-choice” person owns/has major interest charter schools. think PUBLIC schools care money, wait kids enrolled private school. know talking home-schooling private schooling, general reply meant wider audience, completely directed you. reason schools pushing in-person people holding purse strings making them. Don’t blame school itself, blame system ties funding in-person attendance. government entities holding funds hostage don’t give single shit whether put kid private school home school them. That’s less money spend. 

It’s major gas-lighting Republicans right now. Set impossible standards unfounded mandates blame schools can’t safely meet standards. “We gave much flexibility, look handled it. Definitely schools fault, administration.” 

Greg Abbot (TX Gov.) pulling shit local city leaders begging authority. Abbot: “These people asking authority ones can’t even enforce mask mandate already laid out.” Yeah jackass, that’s executive order UNENFORCEABLE. Look caveats exceptions, would impossible local government limited manpower make sure aren’t over-enforcing mask mandates restaurant occupation limits. That’s want authority make ENFORCEABLE rules get virus control. complete utter abdication shirking responsibility allows claim it’s fault virus raging control many areas Wearing mask good start. Yeah, it’s weird, huh? It’s almost like private insurance workplace middle 13% unemployment bad idea. area, everyone complains Affordable Care Act brags longer canceled it. Basically, plan get sick go hospital, get treatment, go straight bankruptcy attorney. Hospitals going take beating huge COVID spike, thousands people going pay bills, people advocate carrying health insurance going complain resulting job losses hospitals. complain Medicare socialism.  death rates start go bonkers. health system magic: made human beings supply chains. unlimited amount resources they're gone, they're gone EVERYBODY.

The herd immunity idiots like Hitler pushing divisions around maps Stalingrad they're starving freezing death without boots. resources exist paper, exist real world. 31 papers year, quite reviews meta studies. number proper studies efficiency corona virus high yet.

One study year find statistically significant reduction community spread mask mandated, effect large.

I go links, year promising titles. says I’m not. I’m wearing mask every day everything still got canceled may give vacation. going happen literally everywhere. Even campus 1 week going detrimental. ruling powers trying get Americans ready complete disregard human life involved forcing re-opens. get worse prepare mass graves victim re-opens.

Refuse arguments absolutes. 16% positivity means nearly 5 million Floridians might it. Staggering. 

Travel banned to/from border shuttered point. Quarantine entire state.

I wish international airlines (whatever remain flying U.S.) would halt service state make point. number deaths going go way coming weeks.

According latest number Florida currently 282,435 confirmed infections. 33,000 considered 'recovered' another 4,277 dead.

If 245,000 actively infected cases shake similar proportion 'recovered' dead, would additional **28,000 Floridians doomed die** without new infections happening all.

Considering 'no new infections' seems highly unlikely, things bound become extremely ugly coming weeks months.

And thanks insistence keeping tourism industry going Florida going let entire rest US partake fun times ahead. Amazon warehouses criticized/accused past allowing people use restroom unless they're scheduled break.

Amazon taking giant shit time honored tradition, rather, god-given right. Passengers sue airline. piece shit Syracuse Rochester fine terms Covid. smoking bot friend?  Oh, introvertest introvert. took months actually feel isolated. get regularly. walk dogs, I’m phone someone least every day, plus video chats etc. None friends care isolate long enough safe hang indoors Texas it’s going fucking hot outdoor social distancing hangs probably October. I’m frustrated alone people parading around like giant social gatherings zero social distancing isn’t big deal. course wearing mask, zodiac killer. Maybe new modus operandi killings. problem leadership america(rep dem) would use extra money help ones need. OK fishy. 100% positivity rate? state department heath question numbers publish them??

EDITED 1: OK took look report. labs tested number people, like 10. reported positive. get it, sample small draw statistical conclusions. labs tested hundreds people still find 80-90% positivity rates. That, opinion way weird. state questioned numbers, IMO. 


EDITED 2: link report, read page 25.

It’s like write recommendation wear jacket it’s cold. haven’t recommend people go around freezing wearing jackets. maybe let people make call themselves? Like masks. guy’s asshole.

But make sure vote representatives future supported this. Paula Gomez votes it. I’m district 5 south county genius, Lisa Sparks, running Congress. Won’t voting her.  People still go dining halls workers live dorms, go libraries staff live dorms, janitors, groundskeepers...

It's closed system, still people student population campus potentially impacted. again, might *your* grandma still someone's callous disregard saddening surprising. ""And doubt rest world gong continue trust us firepower""

Your implication trust us, take us. Yeah constitution explicitly bans that. federal government authority Yup leave enforcement smallest hierarchy expected lackadaisical others. would interesting social rating system similar China. would act present enforcement arm. However really dystopian why... went non-accredited liberal arts school everyones grades well rounded 
and dont regerts. Iirc Florida releasing numbers screwy math what's actually considering ""critical"".

You pretty much get hospitalizations even recently started get released. Agreed. you’re going live society enjoy benefits, need vaccinated (unless small percentage population can’t get due compromised immune system severe allergies essential ingredient). point. Force local resources stop paying testing actually states masks alternative social distancing? Got link? Nah, what’s going happen flight attendant going fired ~~letting picture taken~~ enforcing rules making airline look bad. Weather. US hotspots right ""indoor"" weather hot outside lot. Sweden right ""outdoor"" weather pleasant (15-30C) mostly sunny year. Also Sweden right basically peak summer holiday. Many people work, major cities iether country homes abroad. School out. 

Also, social distancing Sweden, would assume better US. shouldn’t *“or we’ll help see out.”* **We need already seeing out** addition fixing this.

I think I'm curious that. Thank frontline workers!

Unless know they're airline direct route place want go to. Including DoD civilians. record everyone lives Texas feel like Yup. fly Delta AA last month.  


Delta spacing seating, boarded row starting back, enforce mask policy, bag sanitizing wipes seat, pilot came explained air circulation system importance wearing mask. 


AA complete shitshow. Boarding free walk past people already sitting would stopped aisle long periods. completely booked flight even selling last row flight attendants surprised sounded pissed. Mask usage enforced all. flight attendants never left seat lot people either pulled mask nose often completely. also passenger rows behind sweating profusely coughing entire flight. fly AA again. I'm anti-vaxx heard multiple people life anti-vaxx leanings express concern take new vaccine, wanting wait million others took first - lets hope everyone getting idea time else aint gonna work lol. gonna lie say I'm peachy keen early either, rather exceptional situation, need pointed every time-tested vaccine new vaccine. 

Elect stupid politicians, win stupid prizes. like people want cake eat too. Eating cheetos, consuming corporate media, wanting give f either leads globalized world, people ravaging world, suddenly goes sh** want luxury taking vaccine, either. work way. 
 ship sailed long ago. cared lot sooner this.

Anti-vaxxers live naive oversimplified world care public health consequences vaccinating far outweigh small percentage detriment collective vaccination process. part paying dues live society, else please go live woods, special exceptional put everyone else risk - anti-maskers. Free-riders, feel free live way life, free riding backs others, please go somewhere away society. beep boop boop beeeeeeep boop boop. Bones Ted Cruz almost sounds like north-east states upwards 30-40% populations infected,

New York City, hardest hit city, around 20%, nowhere near 30-40%. pockets NYC much higher (parts Queens).

To note, [NYC's Health Department says herd immunity There's still much vulnerable population here. Instead, success we're seeing likely due behavioral changes (masks, distancing, closing potential superspreader locations like indoor dining, contact tracing). Yet found one scientific report states kids vectors. 

Can say absolute certainty kids can't pass virus onto vulnerable adults later die? IIRC city high 20% range state whole much lower question people active sub quite time. bored yet? still paranoid done this? drama teachers? lucky. district saying ""the TEA tied hands"" opening 3 weeks. students two zip codes district qualify free reduced lunch rate 95%. parents can't afford keep home district staffer know says schools likely 90-95% full. that's schools overcrowded already even 90% full means completely full social distancing. mean, kinda helps conservatives literally trying get virus. They’re holding “coronavirus parties” people known infected invited come. They’re trying prove virus hoax. course, many dying becoming seriously ill. Funny? CoVid-19? I'm back normal better normal.

Yes, get back normal 'be same' unless unlucky. information incorrect though. House passed Heroes Act May. claim making? necessarily part term ""plant-based""? claim made outfit making vaccine? 

There many things ""plant-based"" harmful toxic. ""plant based"" gives obligation safer us. 

I believe depends synthetic process used create chemical relation plant-based method would determine ""easier ramp up"", ""plant based"".

Maybe charge Covid task force though. 

As New Yorker he's pretty much corrupt piece shit terms everything non-Covid related. Another thing may different people severely ill COVID-19 may worse long term heath damage, lung damage, stokes, kidney failure etc.

I think long term sequelae bad Spanish Flu, survived, got better, except maybe cases Encephalitis lethargica, though disputed Encephalitis lethargica connected Flu. Refusal wear masks social distancing?  Part problem US protesting also coincided re-openings, straight correlation isn’t definitive proof link. Also, wonder protestors tested positive willing confirm participation protests. could see lying means “not hurting cause.” 

In Minnesota, starting see another uptick cases again, would consistent 3-4 week buildup timeline required detect impact certain actions (i.e. protests). issue also started re-open state around time protests, possible simple attribute uptick cases mass protests. Many upcoming vaccines COVID based vaccine developed SARS. time finished SARS ended wasn’t needed. fact raising vaccine ‘concerns’ without even knowing basic fact implies indeed vaccine resistant else uninformed. post unhelpful potentially deadly. better.

Clearly able build evidence worked one took 2 weeks become operational (and one week found good location) 

Further, large field hospitals never saw patients. doesn’t mean did—again evidence field hospital. reason added went unused point able build able build enough weren’t ever even used.

So I’m little confused you’re calling bullshit. whole point comment America able build field hospitals.  yay! mixed messaging! Listen Dildo, started thread describing ""moving another country residence"" ""an easy choice"". choice costs *at least* 10k right bat, nevermind moving expenses themselves. countries want move (including Canada, suggestion) *require* come 6-12 months salary cash expenses too. That's around 25-30k minimum: Liquid, accounts.

You spent another 5 6 comments complaining *should easy* Americans **TOO POOR IT**, oh, ""it's fault they're poor"". 

So let cut bullshit: **you** get experience changing international residency, long take? born live now? Where'd go school, major? Let's hear credentials. Cause speaking like someone even done basic research, shooting hip: ""Poor people suck"". Typical fucking Americans. Burn baby burn... great news. true numbers show week reopening pubs public indoor areas. hopefully Scots brains English counterparts wear masks keep social distancing. r/technicallythetruth

Haha, real, pretty stupid. always aiming &lt;10%, anything bad. understanding testing **a lot** Florida, still seeing 16% positivity shows fucking COVID-19 response. 

Florida many cases learn from. First China, Italy, West Europe, even US New York, still managed fuck even anyone else basically, rich '1st world' country. shows stupidity leaders there. Uv causes cancer ""fake quote"" paraphrase well known writing generally acceptable use paraphrases summarize what's said. ran 7 miles 900 ft gain 7:30 pace N95. summer. really hard.

Anti-vaxxers reckless idiots they're hardly majority population. comment remarkably foolish assertion.

New York's spread long period time. answer? enough time Florida patients die. predict see steep increase COVID deaths states Florida Texas coming weeks get act together. (Disclaimer: medical professional theory know could talking ass) Dogcapt making joke. paraphrasing one infamous dumbass things Trump said immigrants. sure figures referring to, antibody testing showed 20% antibodies.

Those figures also likely towards higher end estimates; sampling people grocery stores thus provides upper bound estimate antibodies lot people dont go physical stores anymore.

Whether outcome positive definitively discussion had, argument never face masks nothing hinder spread themselves. could trust government work them. sad state SW Volusia county - go grocery store (the place leave house anymore), also see 80/20 masks/no-masks split. thing really pisses people wearing masks also usually young healthy looking. elderly masked, ones wearing masks usually 20-30 somethings yoga pants - probably anti-vaxxers too. wish Publix would start requiring store entrance. fair though

Prior pandemic flew Qatar airways Q Suite Cathay Pacific Business Ho Chi like 140k points, incredibly cheap. availability pretty much anytime looked flights. underreporting.   Delta best airline. don’t fly often always go Delta. Even cheapest seats pretty great imo. Teachers show Texas gets message. Tbh, people know would mind facemasks, even discussed work since job install fiber peoples homes figured respectfull actually wear mask.

But dont even know mask use get them. charter schools follow school board mandate, imagine case, good. Damn. Yeah mean United OK air everything around flight that's crappy. always overbook need ask someone sit flight out. also heard used describe people good point placement facility without actually objecting facility existing.

Cases growing precipitously. Antigen tests look fragments SARS-COV2 virus (as per ) far understand used detect active infections. completely different antibody tests understand correctly. turns out, public schools engine powers almighty American economy.

Sheeeet, Florida breakfast. already cases Swedish people surviving ICU otherwise would let die families fought save them? day Reddit, article said masks protected wearer he's lone wearer 65 percent rate, doubt that. Maybe 15 percent something. still going continue wearing masks anyway. keep reading headline ""Too many peers care grandma died shotgunning Bud Light"". Wait three weeks Florida peaks comparing, also scale numbers deaths per million since population different one party saying mask orders illegal...  report also showed Orlando Veteran’s Medical Center had a positivity rate 76 percent. A spokesperson VA told FOX 35 News Tuesday that reflect numbers positivity rate center actually 6 percent.

Wow!

## Abstract

**Aims**

To describe cardiac abnormalities patients COVID-19 identify characteristics patients would benefit echocardiography.

**Methods results**

In prospective international survey, captured echocardiography findings patients presumed confirmed COVID-19 3 20 April 2020. Patient characteristics, indications, findings, impact echocardiography management recorded. Multivariable logistic regression identified predictors echocardiographic abnormalities. total 1216 patients \[62 (52–71) years, 70% male\] 69 countries across six continents included. Overall, 667 (55%) patients abnormal echocardiogram. Left right ventricular abnormalities reported 479 (39%) 397 (33%) patients, respectively, evidence new myocardial infarction 36 (3%), myocarditis 35 (3%), takotsubo cardiomyopathy 19 (2%). Severe cardiac disease (severe ventricular dysfunction tamponade) observed 182 (15%) patients. without pre-existing cardiac disease (*n* = 901), echocardiogram abnormal 46%, 13% severe disease. Independent predictors left right ventricular abnormalities distinct, including elevated natriuretic peptides \[adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.75–5.05) cardiac troponin (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.13–2.53) former, severity COVID-19 symptoms (OR 3.19, 95% CI 1.73–6.10) latter. Echocardiography changed management 33% patients.

**Conclusion**

In global survey, cardiac abnormalities observed half COVID-19 patients undergoing echocardiography. Abnormalities often unheralded severe, imaging changed management one-third patients. 2-month national quarantine (soft lockdown) reopened last month, mattered even never locked like Taiwan South Korea. small state dependent global trade/commerce, fortunes tied world's health. Heck, scrambling secure food supply early months countries started locking first. that's article says okay virgin haha Derp South elected &amp; nominated person beat him...   Says Miami (or wohle USA) worlds new shithole!""

New? Lincoln Electric makes fantastic welder helmet type deal. wearing balaclava mask, shield 8 months now. tuck chin chest helmet forms seal. 

The biggest problem learning air currents work open close things, walk public, ways set things surfaces etc, air moves door closed, air stays car close window.

I installed fan pointed front door door open, blower keeping shit outside.  numbers low. said 25%, Dr. Fauci's opinion high enough herd. many, many communities Texas, teachers people college degrees around--and thus become target scorn community whenever rage whipped outside sources ""coastal elites"", ""big city lie-berals"", etc.

I absolutely assure teachers community strike, community would almost completely united them. already seeing Big Man start incite hatred schools teachers ""propaganda centers"" part larger electoral strategy inciting mass Culture War. yeah thing... went past weekend friends birthday... big risk me. shocked see many people living happening. little hope point USA survive leading nation unseasonably warm pleasant.

it proof back statement up, that's mean. also uniform whole country, argument pretty weak.

What argument again? ""unseasonably warm pleasant weather"" killed virus, took people outside more? Yeah, July, lower temperatures July like 15-20C, still comfortable objectively beach weather. Actually, beach weather might help considering overcrowding going June's heatwaves. God anything parades, else watch advertisements drive agonizingly slow?

go fishing something, there's plenty shit outside. live Albany/Schenectady, cases going here. There’s also added expenses infrastructure online learning (eg. Unlimited Zoom licenses faculty aren’t free), takes lot time alter curriculum teaching setup online learning. It’s sucky situation everyone. Compared crowded bar full ice arena protest’s spread pretty minimal. I’m saying didn’t happen cops certainly testing positive large numbers made certain choices PPE. Important note part article blatantly false information without pointing out.

""The commentary angered anti-mask advocates, accused Polis discriminating suffer asthma cannot wear face mask.""

Unless lung disorder point can't physically leave house / constantly oxygen absolutely wear mask period. People claiming can't cuz asthma full it. guess masks nothing it? We'll see. +1200 cases UK today, wondering lag effect weekend something sinister, previous Tuesday jump like (basically double last week's figure double Monday's)  Stretch January 1.... people really stupid? **BOOM BABY**  agree US could things better...IF tested small amount, numbers would look way lower here. We'd cases, know them.

As far 275,000 tests 373 cases...How determine test? 275,000 people come symptons 373 test positive?

Because, US, could probably test large group people show doctor symptoms get really low positive rate.

And test aggressively early, basically assumes let people outside virus. would basically impossible US.

For instance, somehow tested 365 million people, quarantined sick...travelers outside would still bring spread eventually.

The type, 275,000 tests 3 months nowhere near enough know accurate picture. keep going back Biden. even brought Hillary!

What looking trump really disgusting human horrible things sympathy common person (YOU!)?

Keep is? think America going well right now? succeeding country?

But reading this, wanting 4 years nothing seems, clear ability critically think use reason.

You're problem country dude.  KnOw RiGhT? Also event took place Republic Airways since cheaper pay regional airline work smaller routes fly planes seat 200+ people. retrospect, overselling flights, better using larger plane one flight multiple regional. Remember said ""We're slow, phased, reopening numbers go we'll stop reverse"".

Turns government version ""just tip"" never going actually slow reverse. Pff see. Many many European countries shit many didn’t even shut properly.  big problem Covid-19 new anecdotal evidence. literally haven’t time proper clinical studies. Yup, point stuff like days ago NY State reported deaths day Texas, caring one's going other's going up. give fuck politics. care well people, general, full stop. current political climate, means generally vote democrats - even though far perfect, far less active harm marginalized groups like BIPOC impoverished Republicans. alternative. Third parties wasted vote. dumbass statement ICE camps: also ""doing want."" following advice experts spent decades studying epidemiology public health. know me. know you. certainly know whiny bitches protesting mask ""freedom"" (lol). 

My apologies caring people look like less me. affliction called empathy. hope day conservatives learn (and no, generous white conservative friends count). online should. kids can’t younger, volunteer, teachers class select few. fact matter it’s fatal younger people teaching essential position. work bank branch tons older employees choice need money considering shift online don’t even think older teachers would go in. allowed province all? damn borders closed reason. Force shun completely public. Lol.

House arrest. Whatever. South Korea still increases cases even though ""golden"" standard you? looks numbers, still active alive seem pretend not.

And Japan? Also another spike lately. Also another golden standard like tout.

New Zealand still reporting positive cases, love tout ""over it"". 

The shit still here, still spreading. Aztecs  Texas mask mandates. Texas’ mandate recent, CA one ages, they’ve constantly locked least strict NY. yet, cases keep rising. Whoopsie... try again.

Texas state wide mask mandate July 3rd, [and included opt clauses counties refusal adopt many 

[California implement statewide mask mandates mid also locked nearly long New York City, else lifted restrictions [in early [near end surprise cases began steeply climbing right afterward.

You making lot assumptions state's reactions virus quite innacurate 25% NYC back April source:

Okay 30% claiming though? difference 400,000 people paper makes assumption super spreaders, gain immunity, significant impact spread lack COVID-19, one hesitant put trust behind. superspreaders ones careful responsible global pandemic. restrictions get lifted population becomes lax complacent safety measures, virus begin spread easily among average citizens Republican. She'll tow party line. SC resident here. Yes, you're* right, enters* body through* mouth nose. also EXITS body through* mouth nose. 

When inhale, air comes general vicinity mouth/nose. 'stream'. Sure, breathing mask trap/block particles, that's relatively minor effect.

When *exhale*, however, form stream air travels quite distance. maskless person basically constantly shooting streams potentially infectious air whatever direction they're looking, whether that's person they're talking to, food supermarket, food lunch truck, whatever.

The primary function masks prevent stream thereby dramatically reducing distance person likely dangerous others, infected.

That's wearing mask selfish. * right told public anything worry about

ftfy else stuffed weeks convalesced?

Literally anywhere else. Send state, use military boat even though may upto par, force ill equipped facilities housing vulnerable population take them. rocket rate matters.

First New York’s numbers tell whole story: state Health Department counts residents physically died within nursing home, omits contracted virus went die hospital York minority reporting deaths way; California’s count for example, includes nursing home patients transferred hospitals died.

So rate 100% higher. ""Gotta hit hard numbers first quarter play catch rest quarters."" 
-America's corporate culture mentality He's old school democrat. He's corrupted shit, politicians, things need get done them.

Wouldn't mind president, we'll see. Anyone gets office going degree corruption, I'd rather someone that's proven able handle large stress situation covid someone failed miserably. States touch: ""Well hello!""

States below: ""Sorry."" Right, probably done next week totally prevent situation getting worse.

/s Bots allowed sub. Hence knickname Doomers. Try turning TV going outside. It’s not, Harris county people Dallas county. Infections per capita higher Dallas Houston actually Haha thanks! that! 

Have great day - keep spreading good information. 

I'll look later. Interesting topic. district plan. looking new job. LOL counts rational discourse?

How heavily imply Germany mask enforcement cause sharp dip graph posted. Except mandate month sharp dip. Thanks answering. answer sounds much differentiated got first one. ""free child care"" comment often used people know takes kids addition teach kids think everyone want to.

It's great take care son well! takes lot effort. Sorry response came across rude b/c read wrong thing comment. ever happened people caring wellbeing? pro-anti debate complete misnomer. real discussion like every issue world, cost quality. Big-pharma serious issue needs heavy reform. Vaccines obviously greatest medical invention aside penicillin. material components clearly breach FDAs regulatory specs. Wake hell up, one cares crazy far gone idiot loud mouth antivax stereotype. point stop gaslighting legitimate concerns humans conduct scientifically scream like barstool frat clones. It’s fight, it’s conversation. real fights deal with, racism, sex offenders power, corruption.  Genomic sequencing expensive. gotten cheaper recent years, still way expensive hospital do

Samples last long they're practically useless. get sent in, need processed right away last long.

Wish could preserve properly sequence cheaply, would make easier work out. Bringing back fairness doctrine would good start. Much conservative media would illegal 50 years ago. According Fauci, enough herd. think overwhelmingly human thing. social creatures evolved collaborating one another working collectively. 

It really generation brainwashing propaganda glorifying individualism personal greed led horrid alienated society. Big reason many depressed, suicidal, anxiety medication, etc Llamaboghini Cool hopefully neighbors never leave Queens one comes inside Queens there’s vaccine Cats awesome 👍endless supply entertainment 😁 Interesting theory virus action, supported minimal in-vitro experiments. Call clinical study real patient outcomes. *This virus spreads primarily indoors.* Well, that’s said municipalities, federal government. again, Dolphins Bucs might fans, Jets, Giants Pats won’t... Don’t know you’re voted. Flight attendants much blame Ted. MSHA recognize KN95s issue citations using them, silly stash N95s inspections KN95s regular working times... Thats joke, yes. think assumed R0 2 1 week incubation gives weekly doubling. purely mathematical point view, doubling 4 weeks (4 generations), R0 2^(0.25), little less 1.2. get understand kids probably fine holy shit want risk kid like that.

Pass. found crisis beat throwing weight around saying we're best side gave in. US wealthy elite. rest us poor trying act rich. Good luck That’s circular argument know it. people sub want believe hope worst. ignore obvious facts. 13 million people infected handful may may reinfected . Suddenly means immunity lasts short time. 

The person mentioned healthcare workers brings valid point. people likely get reinfected actually issue would ones constantly subjected virus. Yet, gets downvoted. Took way long, honestly. technically directly come say it. hard schools plan prepare. teacher minor annoyance, seriously feel bad school administrations clue direction going. mean ""knew,"" can't really anything something official stated. attributed 'young people' celebrating festivals unofficially cancelled. far biggest worrying oubtreak Lleida linked fruit pickers (mostly migrant labour welfare fall back turn work.

It's bit surprising (perhaps even little suspicious) think almost nothing really linked yet bars, restaurants, hotels tourism! That's reaction back March said masks work. doctors news media saying schools safe disservice credibility healthcare professionals giving anti-science crowd bull shit latch onto. Well certainly big enough need fridge trucks pre COVID, weird take bit mid-summer pneumonia bring edge Dude needs shave beard. amazing look worse one. businesses around country making less money moment time, including. still ability operate normal capacity. places still receive amount money considered essential places already pay employees well, like government contractors. Health workers shafted sense making less money midst workers even laid areas receiving pay cuts, well highest risk. would increase lay offs increase pay government would seriously shell health care workers could continue make similar amount money without laid off, even getting actually giving pay bump. country still somewhat economic collapse. Well trust president, Fauci says undoubtedly correct, get couple things wrong, intentionally lied us needing masks. Exactly, criticize people learning mistakes. It’s northeast got hit early people know friends family friends died. won’t lie first heard COVID-19 nyc thought joke saw friends father nearly lose life. shook fuck immediately bought plane ticket France. I’ve ever since lol. Hoping return soon looks like cases pick back Government subsidized daycare subpar learning activities.  leave mine car dashboard. Summer heat/UV kill anything inside car. Early hard seems much better long run. Slow growth seems allow ""all hoax"" mentality set T25 schools Even elementary, class sizes reaching mid-30s. literally defeats purpose.

This country screwed right now. Republican governors literally joined death cult trying kill many people possible, even democrat governors saying “meh know it’s bad can’t close everything people mad won’t get re-elected”.

It’s despicable history show many lives lost it. See that's problem ""essential"" classifications. employer (small office, easy social distance, follow regs) lay people allowed liquor stores pot shops remain open. 

So yeah understand may issue alcoholics, T1 diabetic dying also issue lose health insurance. eradicate body gives essentially [no going isolate everyone planet burns out? would deserved? loss legitimacy mainstream media? Yes--absolutely greatest detriment everyone. want fascism? get fascism. Lol deport Americans. “...cases deaths Arizona. Hospitalizations rebound hit new high, ICU hospitalizations.” 

How irresponsible cherry-pick tweet. Remember, it’s amount COVID visits hospital represent bad gotten state, lack ICU beds number deaths. act like sort alt-right agenda kind broader commentary.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't. Fauci lied American public. posted internet comment saying think lauded honesty integrity.

&amp;#x200B;

It's simple, simple idea. Almost seems simple you, thing want bring BS nothing comment.

&amp;#x200B;

As mentioned first response - I'm critical *entire administration's* response. comment replying saying Fauci honest, wasn't.

&amp;#x200B;

You slap people around red herrings want, never convince anybody anything. Yup, gave sandy hook. They’d rather million kids die ever give inch. [11.8% 60 covid hospitalized, 4.28% mortality 327k teachers texas, average age 43. 18% teachers × 0.18 × 0.0428 = 2,519 dead. categories line different sites, course there's bit rounding here, that's still whole lot dead teachers. that's elderly teachers, 55 immune, infection rate holds, hospitals overwhelmed death rate increase significantly. love Science follow u/smokeandedge 's advice, Unless 99.9999% certain job want work start going 4 year school. Start community college test ""waters"" move still certain. Also trade schools great option depending state. Bruh, I'd *kill* class size 20. go yesterday. 

Saw several people mask around necks. Like??? defeats entire purpose mask. ton influence amoung businesses well respected industry . Big Tesla guy fan Musk striving do. way he/they've chosen handle situation right scary. explain Japan less 1,000 dead wear masks every day despite significantly dense US. UV may good there, another redditor said down, 3M n95 masks get 60C (~140F) *e: long* become damaged, keep mind. protecting lands future generations fucking value. I'm sure future generations agree you. wonder State Income Tax, need parents back work, people buying shit need WFH.

Basically, money important lives. think cases totally hopeless convince them. sure heard facts, believe them.

Best thing could support politicians/political parties/organizations/groups/etc. country advocate mandatory vaccinations. Like making vaccination requirement children visiting kindergartens, schools, sports clubs, etc. also adults certain jobs lot people contact like doctors, nurses, teachers, pastors, on. 

This way people simply lazy get children vaccinated least it. fence cases, too, getting vaccinated would many negative consequences. least would hardcore fringe group anti vaxxers left.  Adding exemptions regulations exactly make regulations ineffective. seems akin “no shirt, shoes, service” thing. business owners rules point. guess question point “Basically winter” high Arizona 115 day... It’s women stereotype. It’s rich, privileged, entitled white person stereo type. I'm professor open-enrollment (like community college), affordable, state-run, commuter school. student too, obviously, blue-collar family help pay way. slogged 12 years higher education (and took lifetime debt) get three degrees required professor field.

Honestly, say super happy proud working school I'm at. look around see students motivated engaged (many adults, paying way, want there) see faculty working asses off, despite lower-than-average salaries, provide highest-quality education possible students.

Most us prefer face-to-face classes social element online work (for teachers right, think school really do). put absolute classes regardless format. ""teaching school"", meaning focus performance evaluation pedagogy. also need contribute scholarship administration program-building, teaching advising core work.

Choose school like this, can. Many giving similar advice, I'm glad see it. Even profs affordable state school community college often PhDs, creds, ""teaching school"", motivated put energy students. Online classes complete bust. honestly say (and student feedback confirms this), students getting 90-95% would get in-class, virtual classes. 3M sending masks overseas US nurses running low? Ah, we’re playing reindeer games see. must type person said “the flu kills people year” covid deaths recorded month in.

Wrong. Check post history. take seriously anyone. think reinfections happening within weeks everyone finally see that... like took forever everyone believe airborn.

I support 100% nationwide lockdown eradication way this. assumptions completely fucking wrong. state taken seriously have. Yeah I've seeing headlines (I dont claim read articles) theyre seeing lasting effects recovered patients lungs instead you’re going give what, 200 million people US Covid booster 90-180 days? [Coronavirus immunity may last 90  Except people like Kanye receive federal stimulus? 

There enough money go around, actually need it. absolutely problem. I'm debating that. 

However, think need majority run headline bearing sentiment like ""So long herd immunity"". millions cases across world, we're gonna see weird stuff like anecdotal reports reinfection. 

As article linked affirms title, hard data suggest reinfection significant possibility. could something else altogether. [This instance, suggests relapse / reinfection may attributed exosomes releasing viral particles delay. 

And here's [the director Harvard Global Health saying short-term reinfection -- we're discussing -- likely going extremely rare, happens all.

Short-term reinfection obviously till air. relative rest country, yes. ofc unless bubble tea place neighborhood open.  countrymen morons I'm getting way sanctioned public shaming guess. IMO Business need step plate, ""mandates"" become meaningless. almost like NYC mismanaged pandemic beginning suffering 25% COVID confirmed deaths, already killed high risk patients cant kill second time. What??? No. think social media exploded couple photos maskless Ted Cruz mainstream media ran became ""the shocking story shameful behavior"" du jour. went FL March/April Trump Health Officials == White House Advisor Chuck Woolery. information get available federal level one less

You know, information would readily available I'm surprised all, New York squandered lead China Italy gave us. difference politicians smart enough listen scientists. Hmmm ya probably. Covid earthquake. resulting economic calamity looming tsunami.  used caretake suite diabetic mice, practically floating pee every morning. don’t know felt need share that. assume swarmy pile mashed potatoes get like entitled oligarchs do. airlines can't afford war Congress, even little weasily bastard like agree. folks shooting articles every damn day? Grant Imahara ""Mythbusters"" died brain aneurysm past week. year miserable. Bread job? Fuck I'm in! Peter Tsai, one inventors N95 mask, recommend using blue shop towels. See  Philly heart mummers US can't find link memo. Anyone it? extra $600/week goes away end month eviction grace periods end, think lot people going *desperate*. Food banks already stretched limits. worry we'll start seeing states fire teachers start marketing $10/hr sub jobs unemployed.  part, yeah. Lots masks, people keeping distance. US only, confused first low estimates mask enforcement occur graph? April 22nd, well curve stabilized.

If going play dumb engage you. Another false statement. preventable. care argue hysterics. Mind telling town 1000 pop. touristy? people think children part alien race?!?!? humans carry disease much adult. 

Why keep saying kill children? enough evidence prove kill children! Schools closed kept children safe. Watch death children sky rocket school opens. going turn worst news headlines couple months. Well, half million people died Unless classify Americans separate species yeah, maybe... otherwise no, rest world handled problem much better Hopefully people end enforcing rule get heads bashed in. already law everywhere? Psssh. Cash app, Venmo, Apple Pay got there. Thank goodness Sometimes, children die *still* change minds, dig in:

 Lol don’t. I’ve seen.  Oh oh oh, I've heard one before! Next say hospitals making lot extra money overreporting Covid deaths, right? Welcome long term butt sit! Somewhat retail, work customers quite bit. I'm trying get better job actually cares employees. Recently got job interview believe, state infected, one used mask headquarters. even told ok wear it. much corruption government protecting people longer. Businesses gone control one keeping check. Ah, see. Seven day average 14% 95 81 398 new cases today, good. Also 28 deaths hospitals, seems likely majority 138 lag weekend previous months. Nah I’m Texan agree. People like don’t help death rate whole population Europe (not infected, people) related covid 0.05-0.1%, quite close excess deaths media, example, check total annual death rate around 1%. infection fatality rate higher that, said around 0.5%. would nice could close rest country open schools NY going shit show again. Mmhmm. Communist governments always trustworthy numbers top notch medical systems definitely believe 100% accurate. Stopping cars knocking random doors far different asking contact information airport. 

BTW, thanks everyone came NY visit first months year helped spread virus fucking place. guy got plasma, improved, deteriorated again. 

Did get enough? Or?  Probably. need much draconian lockdowns nationwide. TN basically like TX light. fucking order food takeout. Don’t know you’re voted. reside Texas completely agree Imagine ruining life piece cloth listen person. de-escalate situations. work customer service can't stand saccharine voice CSRs use. pretty straightforward people lot times shit control. 99% time letting talk showing listening, calms people down. Baker impose requirement issue fines? Welcome fun allowed 2020! This. 10+hour long lines vote

Is actually real thing ? That's completely different argument. I'm saying point, far deadly NY NJ.

I support 100% month-long nationwide lockdown. believe eradication way this. no, dont support *any* state doing, especially AZ, Texas, etc. F  think study linked days ago explaining humidity big reason seasonality respiratory viruses. reasoning low humidity aerosols dry quickly lower size droplets stay afloat longer time. Summer temperate areas would benefit many goes outside, summer hot areas opposite people would crowd inside many cases turn ac. made think getting humidifier winter. put bowls water stoves. It’s great see officials actually following this. They're dumb. People need stop calling Republican leaders dumb. They're not. know exactly they're doing. Logged tell u ur delusional. Ppl sayin kinda nonsense since april look now. virus cannot controlled proper shut down. Lol. Cool. Hitler used kind stuff Gestapo. That’s fun. V shaped recovery!!! using UV light CPAP cleaner sterilize I’m starting change mind need Universal Health care. thing. think need better protection money people spending 8 hours small room 30 kids breathing air. American's often issues something happen real. thought California, live, would better whole situation. Even rural parts state, also live, thought we'd better. Clearly, not. probably till gets LOT worse. SECTION THREE - CORONA

This gives trouble. several policy ideas might explain approach regard election, really convincing. ideas might be:

\- economy (meaning solely stock markets job numbers) one Trump's major selling points. November election happens major resurgence, makes reelection probable. However, majorly neglects negative influence high corona cases deaths reelection chances.

\- Killing Democrats Republicans. evidence inconclusive. even would case, within means democracy.

\- Calculating Republicans go voting control Pandemic. might worked theoretically Trump giving motivation Democrats vote out, daily, think tactic

\- Betting overcoming pandemic November due herd immunity (a losing bet). true, Trump could celebrate mastered Pandemic 

\- Betting pandemic becoming normalized November (an equally bad bet).

\- Letting pandemic get hand make ordinary election impossible.

\- list goes on.

CONCLUSION

There probably different proposals. General measures already implemented, specific measures temper election preparation. prepare number different proposals shift depending developments next months. handling pandemic, however, really fit here. **Irregularities surrounding upcoming presidential election expected, degree happen counter question.**

The handling pandemic might explained Trump power struggles different factions administration and/or GOP. Outside interference pure greed also options. Policies made discussed policymakers decided enacted politicians. demented erratic grifting narcissist politician, likelihood diversion policy quite high. That's multiple ones backup. Power struggles reduce predictability continuity. Outside actors whole nother issue. 

While convinced Trump GOP trying install cement autocratic dreams means, lucky many incompetent idiots. already managed inflict major damage US democracy. competent team would able exploit current situation far effective.

2/2 work hair stylist NJ, we're currently one safest country. went back first time yesterday. felt wrong. felt stupid. N95 face shield clients fantastic. right.

I diagnosed GAD, makes things disaster. informed boss today coming back while. told I'll always job. Thankfully, work one good ones.

This conflicted terrible I've ever felt life. I'm breadwinner family wife lost job. standing inside closed room 8 people yesterday felt ... insane. ready yet. soul crushing. “Big US banks say economy go shit”

“World Health Organization says pandemic may get worse”

“Top scientists say opening schools lead sick dead children”

These things must obvious population... right?

*looks US population* 

Never mind, like ancient alien wisdom us, please keep saying it. Interesting, read paper, past bloombergs synthetic control method statistical method used evaluate effect intervention comparative case studies. involves construction weighted combination groups used controls, treatment group compared. comparison used estimate would happened treatment group received treatment. Unlike difference differences approaches, method account effects confounders changing time, weighting control group better match treatment group intervention.[1] Another advantage synthetic control method allows researchers systematically select comparison groups.[2] applied fields political science,[2] health policy,[1] criminology,[3] economics.[4]

This study, know statistical analysis enough know whether 90% 30% certainty thing. moving indeed find strong convincing statistical support general perception public wearing face masks Jena strongly reduced number incidences. support point wearing face masks cost-efficient
measure fighting Covid-19.

So much strong support cost effective Depending region analyse, find face masks reduced cumulative number registered Covid-19 cases 2.3% 13% period 10 days became compulsory. Assessing the
credibility various estimates, conclude face masks reduce daily growth rate reported infections around 40%.

So strongly effective, 2-10% (better nothing, unless concequences dire, put aside) effective preventing new cases growing fast (they still get virus, spread out. e.g. flattening curve)

One guys confirm me, thought already flattened it, need flatten Data. use official German statistics reported Covid-19 cases Robert Koch
Institute (RKI, 2020). RKI collects data local health authorities provides updates daily basis. Using data (available via API), build balanced panel 401 NUTS Level 3 regions 95 days spanning period January 28 May 1, 2020 (38,095 observations). use cumulative number registered Covid-19 cases district main outcome variable. 5 estimate overall effects variable together disaggregated effects age groups (persons aged 15-34 years, 35-59 years 60+ years). Asan alternative outcome variable, also use cumulative incidence rate. Table 1 shows summary statistics variables sample period.

So took past, predicted would happened put masks based stats already have. correct get wrong addition, argue region’s demographic structure, overall population density age structure, basic health care system, regional endowment physicians pharmacies per population, important factors characterizing local context Covid-19.

So agree elderly populations risk factor, yet blanket policy. I'm guessing cost effective ACTUALLY protecting Although case study Jena framed clear identification strategy, Covid-19 spread single municipality may still driven certain particularities random events may prevent generalization estimated effects. 

It would seem errant redditors generalize results based study, figure clearly shows gradually widening gap cumulative number Covid-19 cases
between Jena synthetic control unit

NGL, reminds climate models.. easy predict week year future climate, gets muddy, complex model variables, see genuine concern here. likely say take look estimated differences age groups, Table A2 appendix indicates largest effects due age group persons aged 60 years above. reduction number registered cases even larger 50%. two age groups find decrease 10 20%.

Lot less 40 unless lump elderly youg people together. entirely accurate.

They go admit would depend adherence variables, things hteir control, best case scenario study. knowing masks people kind throws wrench numbers, again, probably whjy use set analyzing city Jena. introduction face masks 6 April reduced number new infections next 20 days almost 25% relative synthetic control group. corresponds reduction average daily growth rate total number reported infections 1.32 percentage points

I notice say 40%, 50% higher like article said. read says 1.3%, 25% less would (25% 1.3% .31%) basically small difference, compounded time... dependant many variables simultaneously stress need detailed analyses. 

Even author agree bloomberg article. I'm sure find way call asshole dismiss though. can't find P analysis here, say testing random chance even applicable here, bothered check.  Ye ye mind tripping bit much loool live PA. school district plans masks “social distancing”. put “social distancing” air quotes high school 2.4k kids, middle schools 1k, 10 elementary school around 200-600 kids per school. 25-30 kids per classroom, way hell socially distance. Also lunch? stuff couple hundred kids cafeteria wearing masks (because eating)? entire situation appalling. I’m glad I’m high school I’ll going college 40k kids. I'm Dutch stoner predict economic pain coronavirus

Sheesh exactly accused countries numbers.  point, bad sounds, hope collapse Florida shows stupid is.  type people fleeing US due fears COVID logically issue self-quarantining 2 weeks avoid spreading it. worry, see hypothetical happening anyway. Pretty garbage science here. Basically people heart conditions get covid heart conditions say. bashing it? shocked hear 200k people would attend race like socially acceptable here. think Americans worse people, whole; culture, however, tolerant depravity stupidity.

Along time ago, study released South Korean scientist demonstrated reinfection would happen. literal actual scientific evidence. story, data observations collected scientist demonstrating hypothesis. Or, call it, evidence.  Calm hell down.

I made facetious comment based glancing photo article.

JFC like guys look smallest reason try pick damn fight. do? done? can’t thrust family poverty beliefs system broken. kids rely eat... ***CUIDADO!*** Hahaha... brilliance left real time. Don’t blink might miss Actually many documented cases people testing positive second time months later. Nothing available data rules reinfection relapse. pity anyone living FL brain. Make arrangements kids; let back school spawn FloridaMan FloridaKaren. studies shown young children inherently want share. ""Fuck you, got mine"" something learn. I'm even saying inherently wrong. situation going starve death, take survive. America cutthroat totally understand mentality. much like art subjective viewer's interpretation. yes iAy caramba! agree theoretical perspective practice we're seeing doubling average 1 month adjusted #s that. 


Then we're catching we're testing we're basically looking doubling confirmed cases (4 weeks so) doubling ACTUAL cases (probably closer 1 week like saying). asthma well bad. honestly find difficult breathe weeks wearing out, notice much.

I admit wear one work I'm outside gonna 10 feet anyone cause manual labor almost 100 degree heat kinda rough heat depending mask, sweat much clogs makes can't move air it.

Masks really bad they're made wish everyone who's physically able use them, actually can’t wait see headline US. baseless assumptions retail worker brain taken seriously people spent lives studying diseases medicine! I'm done here!):&lt;"" China put physical partitions around every school child classrooms, must wear masks well.

Australians close entire school two weeks one child tests positive coronavirus. Ya think? School's back two weeks? Damn guys short summer. WAY faith leadership do, haha. agree cities take stance all. I'm guessing read sites.

First sentence site: looking bulk orders (10,000 pieces), access FDA-approved N95 KN95 mask producers. Please contact us factory-direct sourcing: bulk@areweoutofmasks.com.

Also look bottom valved N95's KN95's.

As accumed pricing agree people comfortable ordering US supplier. Also people can't bothered write email talk someone phone, click order US supplier.


Edit: Also using non covid use buy cheaper KN95's important parts materials. use rubberband adjust fit good.

Edit: I'll also add one correction accumed prices high near 10x. looks like $3.50-4.50 extra per mask likely sourcing cost. anti vaxxers refuse take vaccine wait even longer get rid virus could end resurgence depending effective vaccine  Americans deserve fail natural selection test. blows mind commonly accepted belief America protests way bolstered spread. logically make sense me. one left report? live Phoenix true. lot ""patriots"" wear masks going out. governor sucks too.

But say this, 2 month ago, Arizona testing nearly amount residents testing currently.  kind wondering much Arizona's rate infection increased versus rate testing= case numbers. virus worse 2 months ago testing reporting lot positive cases now. thier 

their That’s I’m saying! worst part contracting HIV initial flu, skipped HPV vaccination never correlated future types cancer men women pesky red dots Chickenpox go away never hear virus again! Good thing got 3 months anecdotal data, though. I’ll check next blog post BigBrain.org go ”award winning” again.

please name award keep referring to. Speaking Ventura County resident, sure got lot assholes LA county coming Memorial Day trashing parks.

Largely agree OC, LA also bumper crop selfish idiots. telling flu, bro? think replying tests based (I'd guess) worldometers infos state (once again) numbers plain false

These numbers provided French Government - claiming providing fraudulent data? large group ATCs could tap questions asked. tell military folks perform duties elsewhere, good luck conscripting civilian teach school classroom. test like might make possible test everyone, least week.  Catch isolate asymptomatic spreaders infect others. remember reading immune response thing killing them, one could 100% say was. 

Im sure army nerds working overlook actual virus..  right? Foolishness... foolish Foley looks like 👀👀👀 they've 2020  cringey post. embarrassed good thing i'm queens! neighborhood well, can't speak vandalism art?  making god damn sure schools reopening next month... meant come across thinks knows to, fact not. means, I'm saying US testing enough people good job. I'm pointing several countries may dire situation US, vastly underreporting case numbers due test limitation. Or, know, STEM fields. jobs require grad degrees (or knowledge/experience) better know stuff. lots core classroom learning helpful (eg. undergrad research, lab-based courses, free admission museums libraries, access online journals I’d argue nonmajor classes helpful—building relationships clients via art history discussions didn’t come molecular genetics class...).

Most “college piece paper” people know screwed around undergrad got job unrelated tangentially related degree think speaks choices value education. maybe truly learn organic chemistry, cancer genetics, quantum optics high school own...but seems atypical. Looks like marketing scam me. UVC shown basically worthless Covid air purifiers, let alone masks.

Also, statement respirators replaceable filters expensive per year expendable masks, extremely questionable. I've using full-face one pollen long time far cheapest &amp; comfy option available. Nah dude, don’t remember story, excuse anecdote, woman Dallas whose doctor said got twice? Clearly everyone going get reinfected.  online NY form car traveling: knows find NJ one?

""EEEWWWWW! THINK TOUCHED YOU! COOTIES MILLION YEARS! RUN!"" Even though unity, laws pretty consistent, except weed weird liquor laws is, experience. ive lived several regions point feel confident assessment. Anyone think Disney Florida reclose numbers rise? probably open good now. 68-year-old 70-year-old Florida

But course were. Boomers boomers. Americans, bringing disease country. Time deport them. Yeah feel good ""the other"" thank Ronald Reagan that. Exactly. cant life figure rest country didnt learn happened NE. think mix arrogance, ignorance, greed anything. 

CA least already working rein outbreak. contrast FL still doesnt even mask order place. They're gonna try speed run herd immunity entirely predictable results. 

In month people dying Florida hundreds, thousands.

Edit: today saw biggest one day death toll Florida far, 132 deaths. yeah, think kinda want point tiny little finger subreddits like r/politics feeding mania getting caught drama instead there's political leverage political action. like...every news past 5 years Trump same; lied something, badly. yet becomes fixation.

Meanwhile, look much change effected spite Trump terms Police Abolition Black Lives Matter. Maybe lol. God, imagine driver one trucks? thought job bad.. yea cause arguing fox-news boomer parents usually goes well This'll help...right? get COVID19 transmission paper?

I got test today state's run testing since could get test hospital without referral. 2 coworkers' spouses tested positive, prompted go get test. somethings noticed...

They handed paper people cars. People cars filled paper handed back.

The person took tent area someone input info laptop.

Someone else took paper back car put car's wiper. may got person grabbed paper someone else.

You drive up, person grabs paper. person hands swab, insert 1"" nose.

&amp;#x200B;

So potentially sick people filling paper, handing off. Can't person grabs paper get virus gloves hands (some employees even wearing gloves..)? person grabs paper bring car, could virus someone else gloves spread paper. drive up, person administering test grabs paper car hands test. instance grab test, feel like potentially shared germs everyone line front me.

I see anyone first tent sanitze hands. person administering test santized gloved hands prior grabbing paper, concern paper contaminated.

I could find much research this, aside virus living packages 24 hours. seems risk low, still risk...

Also, test stick swab nasal cavity. comfortable. one nostril. accurate? didnt specifically mention friend, cancer survivors general. mean annual Corona Cull, maybe year lucky year??

Or eradicate thing. Karma get disgruntled citizen get first. sorry, keep links. accessed time posts subreddit COVID19 subreddit news outlet reading. also sure quality conclusions studies drew. understand point research points us one direction. Also, problem studies Europe countries lower infections rates general. results applicable US? know.
All saying know enough say children spread less. Sure, perfect lab conditions means less perfect scenarios itll shorter, nonexistent. going 24 hours everything perfect setting lasts 6 days. Thats works.

We diligent ere side overly cautious cautious. cautious leads potential spread virus overly cautious leads slightly inconvenience. Understandable, shut football half city would fire.

Although Wentz gets injured entire city getting set ablaze. fuck. couple found “not guilty” too. vet told shell game. Deutsche Bank says everything super duper. C'mon man.   Come bay lol Oh, they'll blame teachers happens. We'll faulted somehow enforcing social distancing 30 desks crammed 20'x15' room. It’s incredibly negligent ask people protests. it’s good cause, doesn’t mean virus isn’t going attend. It’s fucking lunacy start taking responsibility actions. large crowds virus spread end killing people. 

Lock fuck down. give source says vaccines works almost 10 years? I've searching can't find really want it. &lt;3 NYC healthcare system never collapsed peak there's chance collapses anywhere else. Navy ship sent NYC 1,000 bed capacity ended treating 20 people would specify around whatsoever unless willing wear mask properly otherwise lost cause, sorry sister selfish.  sweet them, flight coronavirus party section cattle class.

Good know. I'm glad I'm going anywhere anytime soon Oh well, trump might launch another tweet endorsing 'one America News Network' shady ass channel like Yup, pretty much. Good two. took 20s. least figured out. daughter works Universal opened while. employees use authority tell people mask call security escort out. would assume Disney would point. However, depends employee much conflict willing bring upon right thing. hope flu infection + Corona infection mutate something lethal. easy solution problem.

If someone walks without mask, close front doors, announce store refuse sell patron anything. 

You need store employees business owners enforcing laws. patron comply, call police trespass them. Reddit loves blame everything zoomers young adults really screwed things time. call generation covid generation. Man... zodiac killer might gained quarantine weight. Hardly recognize him. you’d click link you’d see it’s preprint study Kings College London. LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! LOCK UP!!! Love seeing make assumptions purple. FYI, much social person. used meet friends multiple nights week tutoring teaching day. husband used go one concert year, try take one vacation year. supposed go see niece first time summer. family used get together major holidays sometimes because. 

But trying safe. none us want get sick spread sick. 

I also love applying statement comment VACATIONERS. :) happens incredible unlikely option vaccine becomes ready distributed October (because know Trump try push one know countries, ie Russia, claim people vaccinated end next month). would still remain closed 2 3 months needed imagined ice fishing drinking Molson, never wanted escape summer much. I'm kinda' done this, sake accuracy anyone else happens upon thread. clearly read link posted. Yes, cages built Obama administration. What's happened Trump entirely different matter. Also, Obama created DACA Trump repeatedly attempted get rid it. keep playing tired ass ""both sides"" argument. 

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ No, real. Luckily minority EXTREMELY loud it. almost always Trump Republicans. I'm sorry friend. Facts propaganda.  want hateful racist change reality.

[Brazil Wastewater [First Wuhan Cases December 

Unless virus time travel, well could started Brazil China. going start cursing Brazilians now?

China screwed up. hid virus. lied deaths severity. 6 months US screwing things since China's fault. place virus originated way culpable failure US federal government local governors shutdowns mask requirements. 

You need exit hateful little fox news bubble realize world black white clear villains hate blame complex real world problems. guy got right
[England UK. answers part could basically everyone sweden afford stay home get sick symptoms. really big thing responsible thing. threat ""big one"" literally shaking everything this? Wow... months! might get carpel tunnell  comes cases per million people Arizona says, ""Hold beer!""

They're already fourth country metric, behind New York, New Jersey Louisiana. concerns educational mental development children well really see practical solution that.

This pandemic, things *going* suck.

Instead trying fight consequences accept happen instead focus mitigating best can. Fucking appalling. US continues one-up itself. means deaths Meddling middling? mean, surging cases surrounding states stabilized perfectly vital moment ramp preventative measures. said ""natural"" let spread unchecked. yes, know vaccine may work personally need hold onto hope keep going dark place. specifically say ""In 24 hours"" ... suspect 24 hour period covers two different days, mayor wanted get headline there. mean, hyperbole definitely realize believe this. counter-argument: give state Texas, fetishizes local control ""small government"" point said control hands opposing party anyone wants something different dominant party. State marches says ""No, no, no. Obviously meant best level government one currently control."" holds *doubly* true hyperpartisan nationalized Culture Wars issues.

See: bag ban, mask order, bar/restaurant shutdowns. Depends mean clear. downside number cases look like early June? states follow NY number cases rises quickly decreases slowly. Without vaccine months slope. quarter population sure slows tho. Funny thing polar opposite. reference ""2 weeks they'll dead people streets"", happen. Questionable. NY reopening 800 cases day still Since owning second house ""essential travel""? even allowed entry. part California cost whole state many problems current situation. I’m surprised university professor don’t see problem here....

1. Students taking debt large interest rates pay facilities unable use.

2. completely discounting students learning disabilities. students need structured classroom experience concentrate learn. students longer getting initially signed grades suffer. understand epi curves models show curve complete tapper nothing like ""Wave"" seeing long wave? allowed liquor stores

because liquor stores actually essential, especially pandemic, employer isnt.... state

How? military boat

The Navy specifically said USNS Comfort designed infectious disease, designed force ill equipped facilities housing vulnerable population take them

Nursing homes probably *most* equipped convalescing elderly patients facilities available us. already exactly role. Sad bitter truth. family kids that's little reassuring. guess that's get upholding quality standards avoid getting fined important actually helping people. Let' see:

 South Korea +62

Japan, +368

New Zealand, um 0? 

US +65,488. 

Yep, completely comparable. Common adage responsible personal finance calls 6 months (up year!) emergency funds kept liquid disastrous scenarios like this, individuals.

But corporations, reason, means go paycheck paycheck. fail, taxpayers bail out. Eagles games Lincoln Financial Field expected exempt

Is entire US governed dumb-asses? I'm pretty sure virus care age consent . . . Teenagers going lot infecting. Yup too. know, people actually followed mask, social distancing, sanitizing, etc guidelines could probably *decrease* number people getting flu year, even school session. clearly going happen we're double-fucked guess. careful, dont let use ""we won! over!"" Pretty damning stuff insurance industry sure. mean clusterfuck. Seeds gardening roped places could still buy alcohol.

I assumed everyone older 18 understood Ive explain bunch neighbors why...

We really need fund education better.

So many dumbass people smugly repeating nonsense like makes sense lying. ""They useless going buy millions reason."" thoughts, stance, don’t think matter 50% American families know someone hospitalized died COVID 

I’m reminded New Jersey family regular huge family gathering like 12 people got COVID 6 died something like 

I wonder asked survivors today think postponed party year would say? 

I in-laws adamant Easter party, begged it. showed article New Jersey family didn’t even read 

The compromise delay party month. urged it. heard someone earnestly say “it’s good thing May uncle (WHO LIVES FUCKING LOS ANGELES) sick cold)” 

None statement raised single red flag amongst family members. losing fucking mind 

They ended party May, one got sick, that’s used ammo “see one got sick, told libs mainstream media reacting whole thing” 

I’m resigned fact going get thing hope I’m one unlucky ones throws clots body dies 

The stupidity country hurts close beaches?  article comments amusing. Pool party water park ""fund raiser"". County state mandates gatherings 50 fewer. Schools distance learning options.

It look like going knowing risks. arrogance ignorance. don’t say word anymore friend. Don’t make get face shield! NYC nowhere near herd immunity, recent studies England seem indicate COVID19 immunity disappear months. 

Herd immunity going get us one. Vets do. People don’t. It’s like people get mad Liability policy won’t cover damage car. Imagine US properly dealt situation... people would way likely believe ""oh blown proportion"" would probably opened fast. God damn immigrants get country diseases
/s well sort which? 

We’re 1100 hospitalizations. Broke 1000 last week. I’m American. Don’t mistaken, leading us. direction logic dictate. Florida born feel Florida trashiest state. ya I'm sure American represent whole human species saying. look world getting better WTF. Noone says dirty word. There's campaigning face masks. use face masks want. FHM recommends therefore people don't. 1. send ships thousands beds ended getting used all. set hotels, dorms, something. Literally last place went back nursing home. 
2. understand hard would've been? sound like typical armchair quarterback. lot easier come idea, another thing realize hard would've implement. 
3. going fall rates sword it. keep mind count nursing home deaths died hospital, even mind still 6,000 nursing home deaths. Rates mean shit high number bored yet, disenchanted certain countries. \*waves Israel\* needed.   
America new Florida rest us. invented designed average American. health leaders, including Sacramento County health chief Dr. Peter Beilenson health officer Dr. Olivia Kasirye, said **contact tracing efforts linking large clusters cases indoor, in-home gatherings among friends extended family members guests maintaining adequate social distancing wearing masks.** Please do. Please bunch people buy tickets attend. I’m freaked going back work. sub February: ""WHO says theres evidence airborn, speculation fearmongering.""

This sub July: ""We've known months airborn. idiot deny that.""

Similar story playing right reinfections. RemindMe! 4 months True hear Americans news think it’s hoax, didn’t believe real. what's sad ""real"" Florida death number double that. mean 29 years old war 27 years life. experienced terror attacks ( near 9/11 attacks NY happens), natural disasters ramped up, (Sandy, Katrina, others), see climate change largely unaddressed called hoax.

This even without mentioning personal ex

I don’t cable smug fuck. personally never heard massive amounts NYers summer homes RI

Yeah seems like bit reach. Hell, would hard ask around family group friends find someone remembers ever actually *being* RI. Total shit subjective. way, days rain temps 15 23 bad Nordic standards. New England, fuck rest country doing?  Wearing mask really require ""trust government"" tho  good. ENTIRE point compare America western countries similar dynamics still keep comparing second third world countries. desperate defend terrible dismissing entire point.

You cannot compare countries listed come top. taking everything said america similar countries using agents different countries Lady G needs thrown rest festering bathwater November. hilarious. criminal president criminal things every hour nothing, line drawn senator wearing mask president calls virus hoax refused wear mask near five months now.

This year long Monty Python sketch disappoint. Observe mammalian facial tendrils! Nobody cannot say earth human now! 
1. neglects law large numbers; 
2. assumes one two things happen: die you’re 100% fine.

The US population 328,200,000. one percent population dies, that’s 3,282,000 people dead. 


Three million people dead would monkey wrench economy matter what. doubles number annual deaths once. 


The second bit people keep talking deaths. Deaths, deaths, deaths. one percent die! one percent! One small number! big deal, right? 


What people survive? 


For every one person dies: require hospitalization. 
\-18 permanent heart damage rest lives. 
\-10 permanent lung damage. 
\-3 strokes. 
\-2 neurological damage leads chronic weakness loss coordination. 
\-2 neurological damage leads loss cognitive function.

So sudden, “but it’s 1% fatal!” becomes: people dead. 
\-62,358,000 hospitalized. 
\-59,076,000 people permanent heart damage. 
\-32,820,000 people permanent lung damage. 
\-9,846,000 people strokes. 
\-6,564,000 people muscle weakness. 
\-6,564,000 people loss cognitive function. 


That's thing folks keep going “only 1% dead, what’s big deal?” don’t get. 


The choice “ruin economy save 1%.” reopen economy, destroyed anyway. US economy cannot survive everyone getting COVID-19. Thanks... Ugh...

""Have tried DMT?"" 30 months? Read article; never made claim. misinformation, spreading it. You’re right. Especially bizarre, need anything different. sure. think requiring sources subs (like r/covid19) important, read something seems incredible without source I'll try find something supports elsewhere. time get nervous responding source lol video/ audio quote one that? 

Everything seen March said ""our doctors first responders need masks right now, thanks"" ""please board like toilet paper selfish pricks"" kinda thing. Also one mentions virus mutated contagious here. multiple articles find that. Open schools

If someone thinks vaccinated really placebo, relaxes precautions gets virus either dies lifelong health problems, ethical? Idaho beautiful people definitely made Napoleon Dynamite make sense. I’ve said I’ll say again. god, Donald Trump, wore one. What’s excuse now?   Got real agent smith folks! sucks pandemic team sport. take tons precautions you’ve got assholes putting everyone danger. aren’t unions. They’re “professional associations.” Public employees Texas prohibited striking. teachers, penalty loss teaching license retirement benefits. mean tests free, make vaccines free grandpa ICU virus Romania...

What’s perpetuating spread anti maskers feel it’s fine congregating churches, bars restaurants without masks. That’s anti-science. reopened Casinos too.  forget parents teachers everyone else works school. Also people parents work with. whole thing beyond stupid. reminds [this interesting Philosophy Bites.

They’re murdering instead. mean, yeah... making money corporations taxes, also privately owned small businesses. really can't stopped economy government can't print money. weird say though. I'm able work home. dont think I'm good position say, go ahead let people work produce hide home. said, also good position say, everyone stay home, since everyone make living working home. 

I see argument dead elderly ""positive"" side effect. However, like attribute malice something could complete incompetence.

I'm going inject Pine Sol, fuck daughter, ignore bounties military, fellate Russian Oligarch, wait miracle. That's sterling leadership. Hmm. happens company considered essential, office worker ability work home? company force come work? 

My friend's company whole considered essential, everyone actually needs office person get work done. Even though everyone working home since March, order came out, CEO demanding everyone come back office work week. can't get work done home, want butts seats. That's exactly do, shopping parents walks, nothing really. July 4th trip planned Dells drove week early look around, feel safe. Breaks heart better keep safe try next year. here: here. I'm sorry kids. thought allowed drink planes now? can't hold cup coffee 4 hours order wear mask Show total number deaths (regardless cause) compared period last 5 years ask covid deaths far, far higher theory true. sound mentally unstable. hope family gets help need. point argument simply people influence thought subject, influence coming people visceral immediately negative reaction skepticism nuanced discussion vaccines. think someone long history lying everyone seems ok leaves list. I'd think wearing gloves handling food would solve problem. Colorado here, making us factory wear masks, dont see company cant force employees wear Could ended “I think Hillary would done better job...” theft medical equipment feds still running low?

Idiots. them. Corrupt, despicable wastes oxygen. pure speculation cases people recover, multiple negative tests symptoms, test positive months later symptoms either relapse reinfection? can't force that.

How education commissioner?

[Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran Monday ordered public schools reopen August offer “the full panoply services” students emergency order, public schools required reopen August least five days week provide full array services required law, including in-person instruction services students special It’s entirely possible.

Florida/Texas need take notice. get say totally possible wouldnt put past I've seen far picture flight mask coffee hand head shot sitting terminal mask on. I'm bar mask completely sitting table drinking, move around fo bathroom step outside use phone put mask on. pictures come moving around without mask eyewitness accounts wearing mask majority time using coffee prop hope American Airlines bans cant insult anymore Donald Trump said primaries internet said since.

EDIT: dont prove wrong said first. prove wasnt wearing mask boarded. Florida recorded record high deaths (132). Mexico City used island lake? Issue is, purchased many company's sanitizer bitter, so, confused made like fake product, cause pandemic demand sanitisers really high, so, fake products sold many. (Purchased Amazon). No, I'm mental health professional 20 years experience de-escalation spent decade training employees ""Motivational enhancement"" 

That being, motivate mentally ill charged felony crimes improve mental health understanding courts work stand trial crimes.

I literally spent decade convincing people work hard, could rewarded Prison.

Convincing people wear mask easy.

But would set ego aside see “States, hospitals nursing homes may able rely Washington supply personal protective equipment medical professionals.”

May? absolutely cannot rely. still use Winamp hate every inferior bloated music player I'm really pulling Oxford vaccine.

 I've wondering. death toll virus terrible every live lost tragedy. Im downplay that. 

My question/thoughts:  flu deadly kills many per year. far charts I've seen kills ""healthy"" people year kids people 45. age groups like children higher chance dying flu. 

As far understand, covid WAYYY contagious. guess question is, flu contagious Covid would worse? (Fatality wise-not long term effect wise) 

What makes deadly rate spreads.

Ppl say isnt flu flu pretty terrible even age groups this. 

Got good articles this? Send em way. wait 10 days now? Elections consequences, especially voters swing-state like Florida. wish ideology left market liberalism. right. Mindless rejecting government approved vaccines stupid, blindly accepting government approved vaccines. CDC guidelines vaccine development. Look particular Stage 3 trials about, bits people rushing through. require general public, i.e. **everybody**, take vaccine rushes Stage 3 trials? perhaps high risk folks take rushed vaccine, rest us continue social distancing mask wearing? 

I doctor scientist. someone knowledgeable explain wrong, perfectly happy keep open mind listen. key word **explain**. Simply yelling anyone refuses take government approved vaccine anti-science explanation. Term limits one ideas sound great theory awful practice. give even power lobbyists (who much knowledge legislation newly elected politicians), result worse laws (again, due lack experience), amp team sports-like conduct elections since politicians become dependent party infrastructure win elections. There's lot work political science topic. stylists incapable transmitting virus. first stylist's husband developed symptoms tested positive, daughter son-in-law, roommate.

That going follow question.

So proof masks freedumb says half clients refused testing, last article read said 91 139 clients refused testing.

Face shields thrown, fall off, lost, broken, stolen, swapped shared, dropped toilets, sneezed slathered mud. go home wrong kids, sanitized million things. masks even worse. think China actually gained little cases, deaths since April coronavirus? Factual, scientific, logical consensus deaths undercounted, lies propaganda trying trick people ignoring political reasons. lot us choice is:

look toilet paper disappeared. 

&amp;#x200B;

if anyone idea.. TP supply would dwindled slowly Feb.. instead.. one Monday March.. day live infamy.

&amp;#x200B;

if put masks Feb.. might never lock down.

but told gone April waited. RIP Texas want shut anti-vaxxers? Give supporting facts contrary. That's anti-vaxx movement gained momentum... providing many facts disputed pro-vaxxers. idea gains traction - FACTS. Things like:

\- vaccine companies ""immune"" lawsuits, pharmaceutical companies not?

\- thousands thousands people report children hurt vaccine, vaccine?

\- CDC, company insiders, risk long established careers, leaking contrary information?

\- single vaccinated vs non-vaccinated study? pharmaceuticals everyting else, vaccines?

\- Etc. etc. send ships thousands beds ended getting used all

Comfort meant average hospital things. never supposed quarantine ship well.. historically putting bunch plague ridden people boat almost never works logical. Traveling puts risk pool. point? states got hit first fault own. mistakes made leadership. suffered consequences, also learned lesson since gotten things control opening slowly cautiously try best prevent additional outbreaks. almost certainly perfect. issues. right region whole handle starting slow path back normalcy.

Meanwhile states watched happen, ignored lessons learned, suffering consequences. Even mistakes 100% identical NY FL/TX, fact FL/TX making now, information available, makes much worse.

Like someone trips tree stump something say person watch they're going. someone else watches trip walks trips thing call idiot. northeast tripped, dug problem show everyone ensure knew, states walked tripped anyway. medical staff don’t want kill patients. would happen strike.

I guess ones working could it, need sleep well. It’s easy thing Eagles inexplicably exempt:   Source? self isolate myself. continue practice good hygiene, social distance wearing masks. Instead rushing vaccine, need continue improving treatments people need it. Here’s source Scientific America explaining risks rushing vaccine.

[Risks rushing still way, way ahead states COVID deaths per capita.

The northeast victory laps come little odd me. Part reason better government indifference killed lot vulnerable population already.  states learn northeast, northeast learn Europe. I'm sure keep bringing up. 

NY NJ first epicenters virus. barely knowledge thing. Also testing plays huge factor it. beginning, worst, people getting tests sickest sick. lot died. people get tested anywhere. see death rate slide day day. takes 2 months die? thought 2-3 weeks. We'll number 1 COVID-19 recoveries! want open schools soon. Ridiculous ... Really goes show big difference leadership makes. Although, Canada also national health insurance think also contributes success. America, many people willing get tested take care health medical costs insurance. percentage young people without health insurance especially high, understandable health insurance expensive. help younger demographic that's testing positive Covid moment. WV. Idaho 2nd last. read FL seen big spike pneumonia deaths. think might cooking books bit. honestly? nothing changes. people still anti-mask. purchase it? third world country Even attended protest, nothing happen. protest change anything, protest illusion choice. seen substantial changes since protest started. forget also say ""the death count inflated"" suits agenda know best way keep control seem important? Control information... administration authority tell hospital can’t furnish CDC data. Republican misinformation campaign unfortunately alive well. morning local conservative station Colorado Springs, host absolutely fine caller threatening City Council members ""fight death"" enact ordinance mandating mask wearing city. caller referred members ""brown shirts"" Nazi reference. radio host Richard Randall said ""great call"" spewed nonsense including local government actions conspiring since election year Donald Trump President.

It's especially eye opening watch someone who's views things evolved science that's (in terms COVID). Someone originally staunchly non-N95 masks changed view quite bit. still hates cloth masks (wants production surgical grade masks spun up), also recommends people wear acknowledging something help. rest us become prisoners assholes. can't anything, even safe socially distant way, morons without masks crowding everything. Vietnam don’t wear mask go jail 24 hours get fine. got virus control one month. easily enforce mask mandates, many governors willing so. one cost effective solutions right now.

Also, economy trouble matter what. Telling restaurants reopen going make people go back normal behavior. difference 0% business 20% business restaurant going keep doors open.

In addition, ICU's *are* verge overrun. We'll get point refuse service, people dying treatable injuries illnesses. I'm sure getting information from. would know urgent (because otherwise wait) need repairs anyone oversee property?

I’m familiar ELISA results interesting certainly helpful results previously seen.

It would nice explained upfront instead several comments later, re-iterating things weren’t relevant trying say.

Single parents same. state need know get guardianship child(ren) end orphanage. mom step-mom teach OC grew here. stupid idiots can't grasp basic science logic. already left message machine. cannot happen wear one , anyone would either already making one right Hey again, completely different thread. 

Check conversation thread totally different person:

You: ""But don’t get vaccinated, fall ill... don’t expect much sympathy certainly expect rest us shut stubborn. That’s you, wear one. rest us decided get vaccinated.""

Other guy me: ""I completely agree one thing, similar current diseases like Measles really punishes medical reasons can't vaccinated certain % vaccines minority protected rest. punish vulnerable along idiots""

You again: ""hose idiots ones campaigning strict lockdowns protect vulnerable people.

Contradicting arguments what?""

-----

Let's take look whatever happening inside muddled head yours:

Other guy me, paraphrased: ""Yeah sucks people get vaccinated punish immunocompromised.""

You, paraphrased: ""Yeah anti-vax people apparently pro-shutdown too!"" [Is like are?? live anti-mask, anti-vaxx, anti-shutdown crowd people.]

Then come crazy shit personal responsibility stuff part **our** conversation arguing someone made head, part demographic never even heard real world, convinced represent way. 

I hope cleared way. change tune boss orders to... Clothes blasphemy then. covering gods beautiful sex organs?  I've seen posts r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk people spiking states coming NYC waltzing world without quarantining. too. do? #Posting anyone insurance can't afford care. Please search local FQHC.

Here's search FQHCs. find state. filter state. temp anyway

Immunity following infection may temporary vaccine developers trying induce stronger immune response. Come guys, whole world playing hoax that’s come with? Pathetic. Everyone, start making screenshots past anti-vaxx posts made anti-vaxxer friends social media.  Vaccine trials looking really good right anti-vaxxers able receive vaccine fall Tier Tier II categories. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I'm kidding fuck anti-vaxxers. would say nfl likely back virus won’t infect cause protest just...  believe precedent actually. know industry require vaccine/testing condition employment given employer pays communicates prior hiring. us known since Feb. Phase III much much larger earlier Phases usually 10,000 people. still measures safety immune response like earlier phases also looks efficacy - essentially immune response enough stop infection/symptoms. 

No trials injecting people virus (it happen things like Malaria cure something goes wrong safety net). However, Phase III trials happen countries high levels transmission (eg Oxford Brazil South Africa) enrol people likely come contact disease like health workers.

Once around 30+ people trial tested positive covid-19, check many people tested positive placebo group many vaccine group - small proportion vaccine group test positive compared control group, suggests vaccine effective people get emergency approval. dumb asses. Maybe wait weeks maskers die catching covid.  $1,000 nothing. Lock up. People might dead two weeks them. send places. tweet world. 

He actually control them. may control CDC, control hospitals. half people. Compare flu vaccine. hope there's another viable vaccine works. shit 1037 open ICU beds, 8% ICU admittance. 

Florida 242,000 active cases, meaning potentially 19,300 ICU admittances..... muh freedumb?? We've *got* stop letting damn corporations control us like this. I’m thankful keeps talking even though people either listening even attacking him. US needs people like Fauci! 111 days coronavirus could accelerate massive problem blamed for. FUCK THIS! FUCKING TIRED COVID! NATIONAL MASK MANDATE GET LIVES POST COVID WORLD!!! absolutely not. get people posting shit obviously idea literal [.01 second Google tell otherwise. 

There teachers' unions Texas. Know know? I'm one. 

Unions illegal much within shitty system advocate teachers. talk raising min wage too... Okay good, feel like I’m over-zealous time exactly That’s get bullying Santa /s Yes, defeat purpose whick places ban them. That’s cumulative. don’t think states catch up. main driver deaths states elderly. NY, NJ, PA, MI, CA etc forced nursing homes accept covid positive residents.  New infections south average 30s unless there’s reckless contact young elderly, hope won’t hit high cumulative death rates said done. also heard ""We made Gods image, wearing mask blasphemy"" Granted, probably ~80% bots, check responses tweet. condone that. interested seeing Travis Bexar county stabilize.


edit: meh. good, terrible. importantly: fattens wallet shareholders... Nah, they'll protect mother throughout pregnancy punish baby birth. like republican way. dare push liberal hoax propaganda!!! Yeah, there's that. think rent freezes cities stuff get cancelled people riot, unemployment gets reduced. I'd support it. shit ridiculous. country billionaires, yet people struggling put food table get wifi kids' education. Please strike. families lives important. understand need jobs money band together many possible could cause great change. 

You didn’t sign can’t teach anymore children you’re dead. take twitter feed? 
Also comments dumb dumber....and dumber DUMBER concerned kids, fine, going carry home parents, turn going get sick. makes angry. WELL DUH! GOD DAMN IT! OBVIOUS! whole thing started CHINA PEOPLE THOUSANDS THOUSANDS infected COUNTRY! 

Re-opening move totally void conscience! **THEY CARE US!** bad. administration hide numbers help failing polls. selfish move cost human lives. way put it. love protest.

But seriously apparently fair amount people think covid conspiracy fuck life poorer making government richer.

Because yeah destroying economy great way that.

And rest ""heh fuck quarantine virus exist anymore, plus masks uncomfortable"" situation. Tons people care, all.

So yeah, little bit conspiracy theory, lots people lazy / lacking common sense. Overall mask situation seems less rights. Thailand. Covid killed job. work permit, could get back in. varies lot. live, anything 20 could considered large class (except gym, band, choir, arts programs) Tedros even medical degree, wtf talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

Also, article mentioned extremely misleading people ""socially distancing"" then. cancel events make everyone wear masks, everybody complied, unlike April 2020 current pandemic.

Thankfully, World War much interesting topic Spanish flu. Otherwise, people would socially distancing 2019 even without Took 3 days protests officer killed George even get arrested. may reading tweets correctly good news CEO dump 20,000 shares stock...and chief medical officer exercised 20,000 share option?

Something fishy Denmark...

Look Zaks Tal Zvi...he sold 100k shares stock company last weeks...he Chief Medical Officer Moderna...looks like ""pump dump"" me...borderline insider trading... Gotta control numbers cook books. Maybe everyone staying home stanking house. burn candles bathroom make smell good. everyone staying home work bathroom shits.  fields!!! Sure. opened general store said “no Muslim head coverings allowed”, probably sued.

Only there's specific laws protecting discrimination based religion. store private property, enforce 'arbitrary rule' want customers long violate law. even need *reason* arbitrary rules. CARES act gives certain classes people ability stay home collect pandemic benefits, can't remember top head grossly negligent employer one them. would need look that, however runs end month unless extended, sticking point certain political party giving liability immunity employers like running unsafe operations. Nah, one guy Wired says everyone else lying knows truth. Well, says maybe does. mean, present proof parties take place, says based sees thinks take place. moral superiority, assume right. 

/s (in case needed) NONE worth risking death putting family loved ones harms way well.  fucking selfish honestly teachers taking attitude better GOP forcing teachers situation. Twitter huge disconnect paediatricians (who know nothing schools function) teachers school mental health professionals. Doctors stick lane. Exactly thoughts schools France reopened kids respectful average adults, said, many cases. Welp. buy hold hope got good sense timing cuz know selloff coming soon report cases traced back didney whurl. Yeah Americans get fucking sloshed stop socially distancing altogether real quick.

No matter anyone cuts it, fundamental problem.

Indoor dining cannot happen october want recover regulatory garbage clogging process. know produces antibodies, know mild side effects, yet we're still running phase 3 trial mass production. Sure, might want know exactly effective is, we're certain better nothing mass produce first, figure much better nothing later. let perfect get way good.  people love miserable tiny amount kids dead. likely lifelong health complications. Italy shitty healthcare tho /s Prof. Yaakov Nahmias says research shows novel coronavirus vicious causes lipids deposited lungs, solution undo damage: widely-used anti cholesterol drug called fenofibrate. essential travel only: fixing home choose postpone necessary replacements qualify such. 
I know sucks world changed fundamentally last six months forced us live kinds restrictions limitations, know sucks even more: risking renewed outbreak necessary things get local epidemic control (unlike disease-riddled southern neighbors). 
 
If anything, given possible consequences little stunt, couple glad got mere slap wrist. matter much house worth them, never worth public health. got kind evolutionary thing eventually filtered out, right? never camp “let evolution sort strong weak” it’s inherently skewed vulnerable populations obviously, get sense something like pandemic could actually hit certain people harder based cognitive bug. saddest thing people issue likely won’t even bear consequences alone all; people around will. insane maaaan... He'd insane enough try Macaroni Cheese tariff. Luckily there's Kraft Dinner plant Quebec. Im surprised dont even know unlikely survival youve put ventilator. Gator fan, truer statement UGA found. also never gonna happen. Let’s help buy houses next other. Remember Easter timetable set Trump? would control Easter masks. That's fucked up. goodness. also really easy deep nasal swab. stayed current see machines make consistent, thought great. yeah kill elderly wont second wave hate co-signing conspiracy theories, really can’t help wonder that’s case given signs. 

Minorities indeed likely catch it. They’ll much impacted economic effects. that, Covid giving excuse shut voting polls..I mean, let’s say wouldn’t surprised administration connecting dots too. 

I sincerely hope that’s case though, would truly terrifying. decimal still off, check population Bergamo total deaths Poor goats  *looking around city*

.... fine... y’all trying take dumbasses Canada? Canada, close damn borders!!!! 2nd wave party phase paper ModeRNAs mRNA vaccine.

Abstract anyone interested reading.


BACKGROUND
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged late 2019 spread globally, prompting international effort accelerate development vaccine. candidate vaccine mRNA-1273 encodes stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.


METHODS
We conducted phase 1, dose-escalation, open-label trial including 45 healthy adults, 18 55 years age, received two vaccinations, 28 days apart, mRNA-1273 dose 25 μg, 100 μg, 250 μg. 15 participants dose group.


RESULTS
After first vaccination, antibody responses higher higher dose (day 29 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay anti–S-2P antibody geometric mean titer [GMT], 40,227 25-μg group, 109,209 100-μg group, 213,526 250-μg group). second vaccination, titers increased (day 57 GMT, 299,751, 782,719, 1,192,154, respectively). second vaccination, serum-neutralizing activity detected two methods participants evaluated, values generally similar upper half distribution panel control convalescent serum specimens. Solicited adverse events occurred half participants included fatigue, chills, headache, myalgia, pain injection site. Systemic adverse events common second vaccination, particularly highest dose, three participants (21%) 250-μg dose group reported one severe adverse events.


CONCLUSIONS
The mRNA-1273 vaccine induced anti–SARS-CoV-2 immune responses participants, trial-limiting safety concerns identified. findings support development vaccine. (Funded National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases others; mRNA-1273 ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04283461. opens new tab). irony, moron. statistically, every 1% unemployment increases, 40,000 people die.

but dont bother numbers, youll hurt like rest reddit circle-jerkers. Well agree people ideally wear surgical N95 masks possible. people able to, still believe cloth mask scarf better nothing. That’s scientific bodies suggesting generally trust opinion, everyone. None going change fight stand ourselves.  country edge oblivion none matter change course virus soon soon mean hell lot sooner November. still haven’t offered solution 

There go bad reading comprehension again. need really take time look threads over. 

I explicitly wrote: ""Any vaccine develop would confer immunity beyond natural infection seems result pass virus people could die it.""

Luckily, Oxford vaccine created antibodies level 2-3 times found recovered COVID patients. Hopefully pans out, get regular booster shots maintain immunity COVID-19 eradicated completely. don’t see way life continues productively you’re suggesting.

I'm suggesting anything. I'm merely reiterating facts researchers presenting us. sorry reality situation inconvenient you. Likely ok, 29 million go... Spanish Flu officially ended 1922, 4 years later. fair, I’d like see Trump sentence people vehicular deathmatches dildos cars me, Tucker seems like complete antithesis staunch conservative is. dont even get wants watch human equivalent clutched pearls.

He child like tone asking frivolous subject matter infuriating coming adults mouth.. ""what this? mean that? so, scared be, *in homes?!?*""

Clearly guy that's never faced much faint breeze opposition growing up. Yeah, stupid development well.

We've failed many ways. said, deserve it. Again, ever worked minimum wage job, one lose pay rent feed kids? naivete tells no. course, free report anything OSHA. worth risking job? worth getting employers bad side? maybe hold little longer... Please tell dipshits keep pointing New York's total death count going, ""See? SEE?! Look well Florida compared them!"" u\ravagedbygoats feels like we’re attacking saying experience isn’t everybody’s downvoting makes angry brave. 

lol problem SPREADING DISEASE, lack courage.  WOW, heard her. realize State Rep.  They're fucking idiots  Stock price goes brrrr  sounds right. Problem that, entitled people work everyone else continue wearing mask presents problem timeframe. case need make law fine people wearing mask every state. Add Alaska. Fuck it, add states They're pro birth. they're born, fuck 'em! lifelong damage 6 month old virus

This people take coronavirus seriously. can't keep screaming, ""The end here!"" expect people keep listening come. Appreciate response. Thank you. Michigan, people shooting guys head stabbing people told wear mask won’t Probably announced marrying Obama Hillary Yes. even less. months ago. issues reliability, apparently, also problems hospitals trying source everything necessary tests. Hey totally get stress relief part drinking drugs....work hard play hard friends’ mentality...has since 18 I’m 40. gotta work hard part first !! Today going end around 850. So, we're inching toward 1000 per day total hardly called ""leveling off"" anyone's book. *pro-wrestling heel Florida hot water test results. many Testing centers 100% positive tests... like...no one failed? tried enforcing mask mandate? discussion worth reading reasonable were. Take care guys. Pretty sure lost primary thankfully Seems legit pretty clear Trump lying anymore. don’t think Americans understand devastating virus be. don’t I’m willing bet others. don’t even know extent long term effects know exist. 

This thing parade horribles still people flippantly deciding wear masks.   mean I'm 30 least half time unborn/playing pokemon. lot people say sounds scary find weird things virus body.

On contrary: scary thing many people kills. Knowing kills means work ways treat it. good thing. feel sorry people Texas. sending guys die look good remember that. like non-maskers, hurt people harmed. 

Anti-vaxxers make deadly immune compromised unable vaccinate. 

If get vaccine 70% effective, likely won’t enough herd immunity...unless someone else knows sure. absolutely right. said over. pushing hard mail ballots. orchestrated people realize. yes people actually wear it. Many countries control US lol   appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* functioning humans federal government realized would control well November long cracked wearing mask public would much better place overall right now....but didn’t aren’t. It’s literally simple. Oddly, made tear up. hope needed today. hilarious since effectively solving crisis would made popular. slightly optimistic, anecdotally, people East Tennessee getting MUCH better masking last week so. So.. Maybe we're learning? yea thats covid works. dont look statistics though, might hurt brain Interesting. Thanks sharing! NH here, like rules though covid infection rates aren’t bad due surrounding states serious  live Missouri much saddens say I'm pretty sure public schools still offer parents religious exemptions straight ""personal exemptions"". historic global pandemic outweighs concern, valid is. think anti mask people attention really fucking stupid questioning point T-cell mediated immunity, take time activate therefore create window either asymptomatic mild symptoms, would still contagious others? That's understanding T-cell immunity great contributor herd immunity novel virus situation. Maybe I'm wrong. 

The experts studies looking also cite fact long-term immunity many coronaviruses. get re-infected strain year year, reasonable scenario (though obviously guaranteed even necessarily ilkely) coronavirus. 

The lead Oxford vaccine team said recent technologies used create vaccines interact immune system differently way natural virus does, makes hopeful vaccine treatment (which might take multiple shots require boosters time) may provide complete immunity natural infection people. Ahhh, figures... Another factor putting us potentially last Tuesday holiday catch boosted last Tuesday's numbers.

Still, days showing 40-60% growth week week still expecting today easily top last Tuesday. googled tea.gov website, maybe go ask listen teachers. Worth try. Maybe tell country watching (I hope many are).

Main Switchboard: (512) 463 4734 

I would think try reach commissioner's office?

William B. Travis Building, 1701 Congress Ave, Austin TX, 78701 Especially top pile bureaucrats Betsy Devos. even try hide coverups longer, fucked Lmao must suck live city wealth. Income. good. open back up. reddit circle-jerkers jobs (who kidding, dont, youre fine that) dont understand means 30 million unemployed.

the average age caronavirus deaths 70. nation tired living lives crying lived. Texas 50th nation people health insurance, makes sense open quickly.

Wait... That's question - especially multiple vaccines successful.

The mRNA vaccines understand similar other, Moderna's works Pfizer's likely works extent well mostly monkey see monkey point, since giant orange monkey many worship wear mask, helper monkeys refuse so, also threaten do. add Indianapolis, Indiana list going online only. 
\*Edit - apologizes misstatement, said one township in, Indianapolis, added list. Workers world unite! election former governor (Rick Scott), stopped vote count several counties. due including several absentee votes knowing could possibly defeat DicSatanist. stopping count, election. stole election. DicSatanist even cried TV. willow! solid 40-50% americans bother vote last time, surely spend minutes pulling lever spend months lockdown hopes maybe changing election results. Yeah, thinking going happy, week drew big Xs worksheets refused them. So, improvement. study I've seen place got close 60% antibody rate Bergamo 57% people antibodies Bergamo lost 5% population get that. 

As place aware gotten anywhere near level anti body rate, I'd say 5% accurate figure based current data. Cross posted here: wonder, even effective hypothesize, could produce enough drug things could indeed go back normal? Wish said Feb. know shithole states, NYC vaccinations already mandatory schools easy add another vaccine list. Parents already mandated bring kids vaccines, get coronavirus special get 2 1! Yeah did. epicenter federal government literally stole PPE. Yeah, lose license strike. Dude kidding, shit 'bout get really real. know lot elderly people. one ones know reckless...they want die. 

Not even 87 year old who's diagnosed terminal leukemia. wants months got left. even give single example measure become ""stricter stricter"" changed multiple times since March order satisfy complaint long-term swedish strategy long term. Every single thing claimed loose start got stricter stricter given proof dates like think was. haven’t even tried animal studies, let alone human trials. vitro studies shouldn’t even make news IMHO. country acting interest? WOW, THANKS ALERT JAPAN! NEVER WOULD GUESSED HA HA ! ! assumed follow US's will, like Japan does! worst decision. thought process put putting high risk people covid positive patients. 

I know everyone loves defend beloved democrat governors trump level stupidity. baffles actively try isolate even voters already have. much sugar leaves constant state hunger. makes buy food. Capitalism work. think problem says “could” “would”. it? US privatised healthcare system awful many reasons, think blamed failure Covid. New Zealand's public healthcare system far lower funding US fraction ICU beds per capita US has. experts knew got hit hard would run capacity way faster Italy US would. That's adopted strict lockdown eliminated virus instead. Relying healthcare system ambulance bottom cliff.  I’m nurse “American healthcare workers given shaft” probably written constitution somewhere based joke life. Houston chronicle published hospitalizations down. viruses ""get stronger"" fall - people tend congregate groups indoors. Kids go back school. People spread viruses easily indoors close groups. 

If people wore masks, would less transmission. Lol dumb approach.

He wants good economy, doesn’t want work it.

If administration worked hard clear covid, could probably return level normalcy October, see economy start rebound.

Manipulating numbers makes problem worse, better. makes worst decision could make every single time. point still stands  conveniently left anything yet founder famously anti-semitic.

Really? going judge company now-dead founder believed in? deal Volvo/China claim. hold Tesla US automakers accountable shit America done past 20 years Middle East (let alone since inception)? grasping straws.  Okay, got it, KICK ass running. We're aware this?

well suppose know anything candidates ahead time
if want vote free change guidance world filled people like yourself

""change guidance"" = LYING public noticed keep deleting comments here.

I delete shit. idea your'e talking about. edit comments sometimes. even know tell someone deleting comments whatever referring to. 

Maybe fucking nerd. Won’t happen. Half US clinically stupid. arm gets sore flu shot can't lift past shoulder next day so. Still get every year. Still better flu. Still would annually Covid shot to. I've people tell politicians eating kids. 

Those must ones pedophile ring get hold of, eh? craziness never ends people. simple piece cloth would take, apparently, that's much.  :| Uhm????????? accused China doing??????? Right, seems like already collected enough samples know helped, way correlate data? Tbh throwing every medical record every AI engine see apparent trends. like think somebody already. UGH would get fucking nerves. Where'd come China respond shutting markets response? Stop spreading pro China propaganda here. people telling wayfair trafficking children via online cabinet listings. still haven’t offered solution achievable sustainable. don’t see way life continues productively you’re suggesting. Exactly at. one willing risk sending children back normal school day. precautions impossible keep full day. unreasonable students teachers. remind Sharpiegate.

The thing know sure majority USA wrong approach fight spread.


The real aftermath might seen years. disaster virus actually far worse long term complications.  there's 50% chance moderate side effects, there's ton people going get probably included. TV version protests reality often two distinct things. cameras roll things happen place things happen course means people police interacting close other, anyone attends protests knows feel rare situations avoid them. really easy enough maintain distance masked average march protest. mean err side safety stay away, close call, really, either choice good one. Thoughts prayers, sweetie. two types people go Harvard

1) exceptionally gift student

2) exceptionally rich asswipes parents donating money

Which DeStupid? strictly accurate, say get sicker coronavirus. said average preexisting conditions, may put higher risk. It’s logical, I’m aware studied sure didn’t mention any. “get US” wanted to? one friend EU resident bc direct lineage lived there. one friend works Germany citizen? 100% immune response major side effects higher dosage.

Phase 3 30k participants starts 7/27. I'm going volunteer. paper read. anecdotal evidence doctors regarding symptoms noticed. course going bias towards severe disease. see severe cases end hospitalizing patient. reflect reality virus vast majority cases. I'm still shocked every day unborn lives important eighty year old lives group Eh, maybe rest us favor. 20 29 year olds get become immune fewer vectors passing on. Yes, know die, clearly volunteering take risk. So.maybe let rest us completely avoid contact anyone age group 2021. ok say bad words reddit. “SUCCESSFUL COMPANY SUCCESSFUL! news 11!” No, dumb ass politico. maybe get covid prove it. potential Moderna one they've released data peer reviewed kids young right going lifelong effects living early development, there's way around it. EUA October/November
Widespread distribution Dec/Jan
Most US March

Edit: multiple candidates successful, US could get Based post history, sure seem let Americans live mind rent free much shit us. lack self-awareness call us arrogant? Nice. Florida already basically worldwide epicenter covid, much less US. Agree. LA, one first people got infected person screened passengers arriving China LAX. pace, US recording 100,000 positive cases per day August 5th: 

7 * ( ln(100000/3368309) - ln(1 - (3368309/2948084)^(-1/7)) ) / ln(3368309/2948084) = 23.8 days 

and world see 300,000 cases per day July 30th: 

7 * ( ln(300000/12954225) - ln(1 - (12954225/11480555)^(-1/7)) ) / ln(12954225/11480555) = 17.5 days 

The US still accelerating, couple days ago prediction using math August 9th.

Face shields jack shit stop respiratory droplets. Based what?

Yep. Australia people magically turned heel beliefs vaccinated kids! far that. people agenda studied virus said wasn’t man made. There’s tons data it. understand skeptical. Hell, first too.

No, think everything Trumps fault. vote local DA? one responsible holding police accountable. Doubt it. virus mostly young, almost probability death them, very-young can't even get spread it.

*Young people proceed go back normal.*

Disease observers: **shocked Pikachu face** Knowledge seems best defense paranoia. wash hands touching anything questionable. chances breathing virus one surfaces improbable almost impossible. Disclaimers:

1.) vaccinated recommended medical authorities

2.) think everyone required vaccinated unless medical contraindications diagnoses (no religious ideological exemptions)

3.) think vaccines safe

   Basically, believe science.

This said, reason skeptical safety vaccine? vaccines spent years years tested safety. vaccine developed course 6 months. hesitant see enough time evaluate safety vaccine exhaustive fashion vaccines market.

There think us united work together get rid COVID-19. 

There think (or believe serious)

Quarantine change that.  know? 😮 everything said. Stay mad two emojis brother 😂 someone lives Oregon, 🤮. hope going prosecutions government authorities disregarded scientific evidence encouraged people deaths.  Yeah poorer demographics. Things set run smoothly. reason work day. dissuade people turning up. sure are!

This particular case series strong narrative blame US. Saying hey seems pretty shaky given testing results proposed modes infection get downvoted oblivion.

They great contact tracing end metaphorical equivalent pulling rabbit hat. Today looked delay reported case reported death Floridas newly reported 132 deaths.

You look data here: [http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/\_partners/covid19\_report\_archive/state\_linelist\_latest.pdf](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_linelist_latest.pdf) 

Results: sure philly. I’m south gatherings limited 25 - exception churches, schools. 

So could large events allowed, aside “exceptions” decided governor mayor. better hope enough, there's possibility Texas flip blue election Abbott Trump admin keep fumbling: best. Folks. Believe me.

Whaddya got lose??? model X love it, Elon really shows smart one area one dumbest others.
He really turned Tesla covid comments
Though I'm Keeping car .ʘ‿ʘ think issue starting premise opening economy top priority right now. I'm criticising you, many people disagree. Yes, argument misses point. everyone mentality thinking themselves, “what protects me”, end situation. protects you? do. wearing mask. protects me? wearing yours. 

Also can’t speak efficacy different material type, last read wearing mask reduces risk 65%, honest don’t care exact percentage know using simple logic percentage protecting face covering face isn’t *0*. 

I’m saying you’re saying masks pointless shouldn’t wear them, you’re saying beside point best dangerously misleading worst. Plus she’s hot AF  think debate would could actually compare total deaths per state per month compare last year show results. know source stats. really higher. 

There pandemic 4-6 months STILL made now? directives??

Back April dad, public worker, classic symptoms Covid told could receive test.. middle surge. daily rates would MUCH higher surges capturing data like rising states now.

My point see lot people including friends family mine act like know much better friends south. well 8K deaths state MA, certainly pounding chest saying beat it. saw NBC nightly news included NY one states Covid starting surge again, yet don’t see evidence web Johns Hopkins map.. lying? always think creative ways make money. fell got many times life start over, losing job cakewalk me. lost EVERYTHING Katrina, moved 3 different cities 2 different states year. start scratch kids, work 2 jobs get back feet 9 years later opened business. wish best!

well, he's never worked anything else.

He truly believes say something firmly enough, becomes true. always case past. Maybe I'm wrong think way, take lead testing? saw federal government dropped ball since late January, can't step take proactive measures considering New York huge international travel hub people densely packed other. shut earlier Italy deaths hundreds per day? things could've done need depend federal government.

Don’t worry though. Donald Trump sent God vessel, that’s wife’s relatives tell haven’t one while. Cuomo de Blasio utter failures response. De Blasio told people big deal, flu, change behaviors.

😭😭everything sucks I'm suggesting believe reason make easier allocate resources current hotspots.

I'm saying clearly. Source? I'm almost certain achieve herd immunity. Today shaping much better expecting (in terms deaths). may even top last Tuesday's number unless get crazy numbers California Texas (which quite possible).

This marks second day row falls significantly trend deaths following last week. Certainly can't make conclusions two days data, interesting nonetheless. week tell us lot deaths headed. Stay tuned!

Edit - appears come across saying things dropping. saying all. Rather I'm noting decrease rate increase deaths last two days. last two days deaths broken matching case trend line three weeks ago. Sound promising! something seriously wrong ~~our country~~

our species - conclusion I've come past years. country better lot, worse many ways European ones, I've lost lot faith, seems mean IQ mean empathy empathy distribution issues.

I guess looking centuries millennia, making progress? *hand wobbles* Yeah gave Sure one week.! Totally normal. /  NY around 1,400 deaths per million population. currently peaking states like CA TX 150 deaths per million. looks like Northeast states killed vulnerable people got with. him. Governors thing iirc. UK half deaths similar policy said since beginning. Maybe choose words carefully. Swamp creatures federal government attacking Trump administration? astounding. surprised. negative spin, get closer election, one could predicted... Good news NY deserve praise besides it’s frontline workers. state act soon enough cost large number lives. I’m giving pats back yet. realize many people died right? far success story. fucking dangerous alarm bells going off.  openly Swedish Denmark experiencing difficulties disproves anecdata Danes upset Sweden strategy. people don’t really care.  either. family says I'm nuts, friends go lives like everything normal complain meet walks, visits yard, etc. Nope, gonna it.

That said, we're still ""living up"", spending lot time hiking forests, cycling forest service roads, walking beaches, etc, **BUT** extremely deserted locations absolutely nobody else. Luckily we've always types keep love foraging know remote areas forests never see another person. biggest risk factor driving purposes. get gas station empty self-contained campervan camp remote areas.  said, driving slight known risk, got rear-ended drunk driver back deal police/fire/repair shop (all outdoors), luckily high quality N95 masks left last year's forest fires, we've carrying occasion managed get sick (we're well past incubation period now). France also complete disdain government authority forms? husband teach, don’t know do. like afford work, like Idaho decent vacancies anywhere. ""No... countries stupid.""

*Russia North Korea entered chat.* Hell yeah, mean perfect definitely way better most. People burn NYC lifestyle time ""Communism incorrectly report public health data"" -Karl Marx Wipe poor, reduce overall “burden” rich get richer. but...I thought Facts Feelz? Keeps beer cold. GOP CCP much closer ideology either one likes admit. it’ll never happen... got it. wish - we'd lot better. New York terrible job managing break. Peoples memories awfully short. worked correct it, let's pretend great model start. Yes. I've really surprised hear parents area concerned middle school sports field trips kids' general safety classroom. district Q&amp;A parents yesterday many parents asking dumb questions acting like everything A-Okay back school go. really surprised me. think scandals uncovered within 10 years. anyone still alive is. relating story nurse told her? also predict coronavirus outbreaks using social-media data looking places posting live event Facebook notifications. long expect phase 3 last approval? 

Also, one caveat test tested people ages 18-55. Hope results 55+ people promising. That’s Flyera shit. live St. Louis County confirm overheard many people live say drive St. Charles shop sign protest mask mandate. incredibly stupid allow two large neighboring counties complete opposite rules restrictions. 

Although certain Missouri continue see increase cases - governor turn blind eye order ""save Missouri economy"". said, political figures expect companies allow employees work home take time uncomfortable physically work. However, company's anything like mine - allow courtesy work home long state city require it. reason office allowed us work home March St. Louis issued stay home order....this time different. worried see bad prominent cases continue become Missouri. Thank much reply information. 

Yeah, quarantined back house bathroom, can’t come wife drop items need them.

They gave oxy sat test yesterday 96%. usually normally.  Election consequences, life death consequences. They’d manage best could Er divert hospital capacity they’d never reach full hospital. Every person ranting masks also ranting liberals. Well yeah 0 deaths day big accomplishment we're long done acting likes already stonks go Yep bodies refrigerators happens.... happens... Sadly seems wingnut.   Wholesome award what? MN. He's right schools. school went voted best second best country believe. stopped laughing guys decided come (Ireland) vacation govt next nothing stop even force 14 day isolation. feel like COVID take care fight us time. Anyone Sweden forum? actual Sweden residents credit sudden drop cases, hospitalizations deaths? Please read full post... said need fund school lot solid plan reopen... face big problems said... lot family hurting without meal program day care kids... especially don’t many jobs... example mother 4 year old baby choose go work (minimum wage job) stay home take care baby... lose job... really shitty place country... don’t much options left... teachers staff? Masks decrease oxygen level blood. agree this, medical condition makes cant wear mask likely FUCKED get COVID. Obviously go work, go work. get groceries, go get groceries. thing medical services. anything else, deserve whatever fate happens you. Today(or effective date Wednesday) may mark grim turning point US history. see dramatic shift reporting- less cases, less % positive results, less deaths, bed availability, less strain medical systems. system controls aspects flow information, there’s telling come it. right mind within HHS would defy trumps orders withhold information public view. likely argue mass information available sparking panic cease sharing benefit. That, reduced testing already announced, leave people completely blind happening. result seeing cries help working hospitals reach news organizations still bold enough defy trump. 

In days, maybe weeks, “defeated terrible China virus, saved millions lives, best response &amp; healthcare world, made it”- trumps future words. 

The CDC last voice reason, quite literally removed responsibility this. Betsy DeVos offers us zero strategies plans pointing countries success stories, says deal local level. schools force teachers buy majority supplies already public schools defunded help, enrich friends private sector. future generations inevitably suffer claim victory. actually happening... people support person “he doesn’t answer anyone” yet dismantled one safeguard another.. fear children, teachers, precious healthcare workers. folks beaten down, taken order they’re falling ill dying, atmosphere already experiencing critical shortages staffing. 

Every weakness healthcare safety nets patched &amp; barely held together stripped. What’s even worse, thousands bright young minds ready enter field medicine limited Government doesn’t want update legislation increase educational support fill physician shortages becoming obvious systems strained. 

Winter coming. Influenza merciless. common folk left jobs, insurance coverage, forced emergency rooms hallways filled beds covid. find checking see dream.. wake up? People home starving death dying covid. hiso go hospital already country safe places. think reinfection issue also fact people enough prevent virus spreading. Breazil, uk, usa main countries idle dire consequences particular countries also means potential reinfect regions ignorance, also high moment. confirm, live Hialeah. full conservative shit sticks vote republican way due abstract fear communism/socialism (they even know words mean). entire time whole Cuban expat community Hialeah playing games, wearing masks, following type guidelines. also confirm voted DeSantis. let anyone fool you, Cubans think white extremely racist (not course large part). also horribly educated, Ill mannered, think know absolutely everything. come here, stay away, infested COVID-19 listen. also add 1st generation Cuban-American deal intense stupidity every day wretched existence. Mine nurse, qualified anything. worth pointing they're striking keep schools closed, kind lateral move public. Could we? Maybe. we? No. sub full people lack qualifications guide afraid voice opinions. base opinion qualified sources. different things might Florida voted Gillum. October 31.... 2023? believe enforcing fine although think nearly much money I'm sure plan enforce it. I'm sure many us normal non-pandemic circumstances would attending protests Covid. wanted several protests city little kids, health comes first go. ""Keep protesting"". NYT

At point NYT pushing people get infected name wokeness? admin bring everything anything back hating minorities. That's card play election. Vaccine available later year / early next year. news vaccine approved ready fo use bump stock tremendously. So, sell stock (of course selling lot stock makes stock price drop now), wait til right announcement, buy shit ton stock, news comes out, profit $$ well, let anyone Disney World buy ticket. safe there, ask gov disney people. send city disney world. There's also old people refuse wear masks practice social distancing too. young. According mother 55+ community took old guy hospital confirmed Covid trouble breathing. prior? Hanging around community, people over, calling hoax, masks, etc. people get tested likely it. selfish attitude. Anecdotal know, true story. german experts baffled low death rate. expected much higher... that's acted quickly... that's low death rate.    
You see difference two weeks make. Italy, Belgium France much less Germany little later. much later, late.     
I'm pretty sure lockdown soon first cases like Germany, would much less deaths... would probably say ""It necessary lock whole country couple deaths"" trying careful word choice.
Lung cancer happened deserving person 🤗 realize gonna come back defenses true second wave hits.  


We see bad things now, expect bury data info future attempt force economy action .  


they lie safety order get help churn economic engine starting. too...well us are, saner members society Nah, infection graph totally facing wrong way Yep. Thailand speak something, happening. random tho. done sickest covid patients extrapolated entire population. yea, everyones already dead. Arizona health care worker: ""Who?"" EIB= Excellence Bullshit accurate April? Every day like small city nearby major metropolitan area, Jesus. Floridified. Maybe it’s I’ve gotten use wearing one work day, still don’t see people issues wearing masks. People pretending pandemic petty problem participate parties popping up. Alliteration. Probably Orange County* take lessons heart. truly would easy see works right? large number people Tricor died Covid move on...if not...PARTY ON!!! AAP's statement outlandish even cavalier. read entire statement, clear reopening schools rigid demand, call put high priority US pursue. provide guidance grade terms social distancing, also make clear first two bullets needs adaptive revised based individual school districts current situation.

I think would agree reopening schools safely ought high priority, falls state's reopening phased schedule worth discussion without huge political debate behind it.

&amp;#x200B;

From first school re-entry policies consider following key principles:  policies must flexible nimble responding new information,*** administrators must willing refine approaches specific policies working.  critically important develop strategies revised adapted depending level viral transmission school throughout community done close communication state and/or local public health authorities recognizing differences school districts, including urban, suburban, rural districts.***   principles mind, **the AAP strongly advocates policy considerations coming school year start goal students physically present school**. second recognize children learn best physically present classroom. children get much academics school. also learn social emotional skills school, get healthy meals exercise, mental health support services cannot easily replicated online. Schools also play critical role addressing racial social inequity. nation’s response COVID-19 laid bare inequities consequences children must addressed. pandemic especially hard families rely school lunches, children disabilities, lack access Internet health care.  school important healthy development well-being children, must pursue re-opening way safe students, teachers staff. Science drive decision-making safely reopening schools. Public health agencies must make recommendations based evidence, politics. leave health experts tell us time best open school buildings, listen educators administrators shape therapy last ditch effort keep alive, potentially destroying lungs mechanical oversaturation air pressure oxygen. sedated treatment traumatising. I'll dead frankly care. It'd different actually assets/property. fail see ""literally"" every adult one. nothing give loved ones. Right exactly. would LOVE escape Canada could, bet ass would follow everything asked me. we're screwed, telling me. scary thing is, trusted meth lab little bit more.  actually knew dangerous, took safety precautions. Sure, fatty liver disease, triglycerides well 400 (150 high) years ago everything else norms. going paleo couple years back, triglycerides 50-75, still fenofibrate doc like paleo - thinks I'll cheat. 

Was going get let stop, I'll continue bit longer. cause nobody ever wants go upstate unless forced to, nobody coming virus AKA China Next president’s slogan ‘Make America Great Again’ Agreed. mean, get sore arm every flu vaccine, get worse sore arm bump side kitchen counter. pump full vaccine too. (I've fact already tried sign phase 3 trial, doubt they'll accept since work home lot exposure otherwise). alternative: OP experiencing manic episode lasted 3+ months, Sweden reason become target obsessive search information fight back anxiety. 

either way it’s concerning. downvoted? You’re right, two weeks ago 7 day average new hospitalizations 365, 140.

Now may due lack capacity they’re adding less beds, indication outbreak spread. 

I’ve noticed too. It’s AZ well. Whoooooosh Yeah. Jesus white blue eyes. focusing tiny group conspiracy theorists vs actual problem young people partying another way fuck covid response totally politics vs reality. already know mask use higher Canada Europe. Thumbs hope another company working traditional inactivated vaccine.  Everything bigger Texas. here's problem, sociopath apparently reading comprehension toilet well. 

You arguing different people time two completely different posts can't even keep track conversation. Look back post history last hour so. place.

You coming left field hardcore crazy shit never part conversation thread. said that’s vaccinated naturally acquired immunity it’s issue mild colds NEVER issue

You literally never said thread, thinking somehow summed aren’t scared common cold flu, would scare us sudden?

And said common cold flu kill 130,000 people six months. ranted something personal responsibility bunch shit nothing talking about. **WE** talking people vaccinated. 

**WE** talking herd immunity option natural infection rate immunity seems fade matter months. don’t know called solution isn’t sustainable. know fact. realistic, you’re ridiculously left socially distance wear masks forever? isolate forever? live government welfare forever? work None sustainable sooner realise ISNT going anywhere happier you’ll be. thread circle jerk doom gloom. I’d love hear solution, solution achievable sustainable.

This entire part response literally arguing yourself. need take breath, brush reading, calm guy. Shut news take walk. commentary walking back today? definitely ""low"" community spread. Blame nature political action, we're talking political blame one source.

Blame aside, absolutely way governors sort politician making public health decisions like this. need federal CDC make them. true all. Yeah.. birx bought administration cant trusted. Wow. wonder... Time pass new law stronger Pendleton Act 1883. looked found another civil service reform act 1878 prohibits nepotism crying loud. tf you-know-whos get jobs WH. unqualified mofos. Need make everyone pass specific exams get job. shit needs stop. look sketchy bit guinea pig situation, works we'll know.  


Wasn't one coming India well, one? can’t deport citizens. One people couple Canadian got first place. [left arm right Beware, contrarian. would mute then, comparing case curves death curves states like New York New Jersey we’re hit hardest April, appear deaths lagged cases 2 weeks most? that's bad raise care others. gentleman end lmao .007% population date succumbed, .16% world “confirmed” it. use percentages news stories telling us increases prior days instead actual numbers? Big percentages sound scary small percentages don’t? spike may also backlog probable deaths, locations issues reporting. example France Belgium also show similar spikes (albeit multiple, smaller ones). he’s alone room, moron. They’re saying wear masks 24 hrs/day, you’re public. It’s hard believe people stupid. Churches. lot Megachurches Texas... boy upset could person services. Im still certain somehow moved dimensions one somewhere movie idiocracy. live? coworker dual citizen US European country he's heading (for vacation!) later month. another adult sit still save life. reads child abuse. I'm glad got kid cesspool. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 Also fire pit stocks. else rural/suburban see friends winter? That's look moving average... moving up.  still hard comprehend armed militias busted way buildings blocked roads hospital still get arrested it. Protesting haircuts bar salons worthwhile cause. Right New Zealand getting 1 new case 24 hours enough induce panic Deaths higher Monday last Monday. Remains seen end today, we're sitting 700 bunch states still coming in. may last Tuesday, significant. Imagine UK far fewer people wear mask US Europe. I'm often one mask wearers shops old ladies seem particularly keen telling wearing them. Looks like cheap real estate FLA time next year. NY literally handled worse state. mean? actually slight increase seeing, tho, hopefully small bump 4th trend. Nothing gonna happen, maybe airline apologize Ted Cruz.

Remember lawyer shot Dick Cheney 2005?  apologized Dick Cheney.

That’s “powerful” works guess everyone something bucket list? ""masks prevent virus"" thing nuanced that. 

They knew masks would effective helping stop spread, time worried two main things:

1) shortages masks healthcare workers

2) people wearing masks improperly getting false sense security

Basically mask hands doctor nurse going valuable one hands random person, people already begun hoarding (toilet paper, bread flour, told months ago beginning lockdown

Right. thinking locked down, social distancing, good hygiene would preclude need everyone wear mask. supposed sheltered place house, would need mask? People thinking mask magic barrier would tend go more, making problem worse.

We've seen well straight forward people relying right thing works. played effectiveness masks, would even fewer frontline healthcare workers. 

People morons, no-win situation dealing general public. mention garbage salaries teachers get paid put that? wish lived somewhere else.  It’s hypothetical even place speculation could take us “selling Alaska” comical sad. really hard get everyone wear mask, spent last six months telling people wear mask.

This mistake cost far greater originally anticipated..... I've described happening fact. 

Isolate vulnerable. Exactly, I'm West Chester, see masks everyone. drama refusal enter. mask, entry. Calm down, Riot Games. death penalty him. that's others without mask. fair fair. According current statistics, herd immunity means close 5% population ends dead. That's ok. American public much generally unhealthy much world success mitigating virus, diabetes obesity translates increased comorbidity likelihood death.

Wear mask. political. European countries hit hardest nearly fully recovered basic advice healthcare professionals followed. China controlled regulated wet markets here

can *prove* came wet market? Help difficult times maybe make new friends die.      
No kidding. keep complaining. is, course, technically impossible rule existence Covid parties. Maybe somewhere vast complex nation foolish people getting infected purpose. It’s also possible miasma media coverage coalesce vector own, inspiring Covid parties otherwise would happened. far there’s hard evidence even single one taken place—just recurring cycle breathless, unsubstantiated media coverage. Okay leave open bunch withdrawaing sick people yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really depends amount negligence. fire house caused spark landed open pool gasoline burns neighborhood court would probably deem decision keep gasoline open pool proximate cause rather house fire. students deserve rate increase people hospitalizations certainly slowed run beds. paper, think would mean deaths start shooting up. Deaths outside hospitals unlikely tested COVID, though, ""count"" months. 

However, also could mean actually need beds flattened spread.

In short, information publicly available let us know happening now. Cases capped, hospitalizations capped, non-hospitalized deaths probably still reported. I'm genuinely skeptical person set foot university. Certainly professor. They've got insane fixation grammar predictor ability education seems straight pompous boarding school circa 1953. Possible they're instructor finishing school (French perhaps) environment planet Earth conventional wisdom might still taught.

Would recommend engaging. Phase 3, approval... manufacturing scale getting shitty US healthcare system . December/Jan maybe? Would phrase statement guns way? mask's fault here, never gun's fault? Huh. We’ll see. one people thinks kids shouldn’t attend funerals loved ones?

You obviously diplomatic it. kids absolutely understand mortality potential Covid, necessity wear mask. infect people Coronavirus catch it, kill grandparents. maybe even us, parents. 

We aren’t insane state city they’ll required attend school person, though. though? Might almost better introduce e-learning learning younger age? Especially context fighting global pandemic without vaccine. Id argue teaching kids use computers self learn relevance future disease ridden classroom. think continuing 30 days extension good mental health immigration officers, 60 -90 days palatable, side, economic impact delaying border entry 3 months huge deal Canada. crazy decision made. Thanks ignorant US citizens, come now, America slowly surely become isolated country 2020. Doubt it. probably reclassified counts covid death. places fudge numbers look better. 

Like dying something got covid. know died covid.

 covid would lived gotten secondary problem begin with. Convincing morons stupid never works. He's saying leave local officials knows federal government not. Yeah, seems like logical thing instead writing fucking will. Death go work? Seems like obvious answer. Texas, they’ll lose job retirement. schools already moved majority teachers substitutes benefits well. sister’s school district would probably pounce getting rid full time salaries teachers benefits. They’ll gladly fill spots part time substitutes. Hey moment safely go back favorite corner table favorite bar stoked. figure week 2 get potential vaccine(whenever hell is) Yeah, people looked 1918 Flu second wave, concluded that's ""just pandemics work"". necessarily true. 

Reaction time slow back then. time make couple major policy changes (or ""culture changes""), disease behaved accordingly ""eras"". 

Today closely resemble neurotic chipmunk sleepy bear 1918 brethren. kinds shit, makes sense, doesn't. effect whole bunch micro-waves, seems me. We'll see there's big one, I'd imagine based policy change culture change, ""that's diseases work"" Phase 3 usually goes control group hits specific number cases. infections still high it’s tested number hit relatively quickly. Isolate myself... People amaze every day. What's going mid west states? barely hear anything them. Communist regimes well known suppressing information, manipulating public perception situations within country. I'm sure point trying make. Birx complained hospitals adequately reporting data, convened working group government hospital officials devised new plan, according Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer Association American Medical Colleges, participated. .. definitely NFL Eagles football? mean figured but... making teachers sacrificial lambs. 


Pediatricians already see dozens different kids per week parents, *known* sick, frequently get close them, examine them, sometimes aerosol generating procedures them. Teachers see 25 kids week, none parents/families, theoretically ever touch deal screaming/crying spreading virus everywhere. risk getting sick seems far lower teachers pediatricians. 


I mean, oppose school reopenings us right now, understand point. It’s hard downvote 1% high-end, math. America's current IFR 1%.

I think 3% ultimately encompass third-world nations least suited this. final IFR countries many times greater western nations. think western countries see IFR win, picture, they’re fucked. reopen close, blame falls set agenda reopen made decision forced hand. Reminder current bump due protests. Wear masks get mad outside instead leaving masks home storming state owned buildings. Science pick political favorites, political favorites pick science. like watching people argue wearing condom might help prevent pregnancy. Seems promising. 

Only thing would suggest patience. Phase 3 needs go perfect tested people 55+ yet. 

And even available... Bringing scale US going take time.

But still good news. USA!! USA!! Land jackasses idiots foresight empathy!! Wooo 🤪🥳🤮 That's specific prediction... really figured much.. ANTI mask crowd whats extra 10 min drive right? Problem leadership understand.. maybe want extra tax dollars... since closed borders going things like happen.. happened opened bars restaurants etc earlier. bode well us literally things attract likely take least amount precautions. assume Stl city County going fair much better us long term due mask mandates actually taking seriously.

 ya complete lack co-ordination metro area..not mention regional etc going keep causing issues. mean.. im like 20 min drive illinois example. Reminds drinking age ILL 18 21 MO many people crossed buy beer.. 1:30 many people make run east side alcohol differing liquor sale hours. Swine flu much country, wonder why...maybe competent government back then? Ha ha, forgot Mountain Dew part Camacho’s name. According “Experts”, can’t spread Covid protesting outdoors wear mask, it!! Mask, mask tyranny.
Why try cannibalism instead tyranny? Thank you. sick people saying this. evidence means haven’t enough studies data. Assume anything possible. Chance attending protest directly causing meaningful societal change: Next 0%.

Chance getting virus protest: Much higher that.

It's tough decision. someone wants shame protecting health, they're bad anti-maskers. uh huh No, stating I’m high school dropout Ad Hominem. 

You’re obviously low-IQ idiot. That’s example another. think everyone agrees decision keep people nursing homes probably mistake best decision time much confusion unknowns virus.

The Pro-COVID folks using early mistakes, NY learned to, refute almost Cuomo's subsequent decisions regards lock downs masks. really care people died, act. extremely disingenuous side certain parts country situation people. I’m thinking places multiple feet snow. wind rain would work. traumatized politicians decided sacrifice better advice. 

This new phenomenon. 

Source: 14 years healthcare - 6 Houston, Texas. sad part is, everyone could start wearing masks tomorrow, 4-8 weeks still cases (there obviously be), detractors call lie Darwinism work. think NBA season bellwether. 

I think NBA complete season, promising Leagues. NBA shut season midway, Leagues going next impossible time.

And worth, NBA taking pretty seriously. player exited bubble (by short distance) grab food GrubHub delivery guy, player skip practices, isolate 10 days, pass battery tests able resume. realize reason believe Trump weaponizing virus order increase odds winning election. administration already removed thousands voting rolls previous administrations, pushed polling locations consolidated thus making voting much uncomfortable big, largely liberal, cities. already working mess election prepandemic. months Trump co. manipulating right believing virus threat Democrats generally pushing need take seriously people die, likely show vote? millions unafraid country folk spread would lick others assholes Trump asked to, millions liberals packed cities afraid room 2 people? virus made political Trump attacking election veil misinformation built months, may intentionally allowing virus spread.
And this, Trump co. taking almost direct control numbers always claimed wrong. guess we'll wait see numbers anything funny, hopefully merely way administration say plot doctor numbers.

No matter political party part of, get absentee ballots. idea pandemic look like November seem like it'll get much better. worth risk. Idk nurses hospitals dont always know tests for. hospital doctors tell nurses key in, us lab nerds really one doctor understand specificity looking for. three possible antibody tests run blood covid, wouldnt know one looking (IgG, IgM IgG three) Yeah, like consumer economy needs consumers money! Oh wait... submission removed because


**Titles must edited source.** submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed [title Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed. ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* shows Maine basically state safely return 100 percent mobility Oct 1 masks masks, shows Maine creeping come Nov. Faster masks course. 

As Mainer moved away I've thought moving back pandemic. remember February. blow it! sad Rush Lung Cancer preaching tobacco cause cancer 20 years. strange. early pandemic started post factual unbiaised news catastrophic strategy Sweden mass downvoted horde swedish fanboys hear anything ""Sweden exceptional country world anything bad comes foreigner anyway"".     
I think motivated spread truth even more.     
Some people spend time energy save lives, save reputation beloved countries... Well, virus tears city kills everyone it’s gonna kill. one talking that? exactly NYC expected look like. northeast place US didn’t effectively flatten curve ask around Europe. country, situation almost back normal, except everyone wearing masks ban large mass gatherings.
But course, competent government actually listens doctors scientists... 2024 next schedule election that. Hopefully demographic change reached turning point. kept proving wrong, simply don’t get it. Plague still super deadly even take antibiotics.

That's reason humans get much anymore. Working grocery store Ma.now. I'm break. People follow mask rules pretty well, starting see people wearing smug look like they're looking fight. gonna get worse. give shit school. care students/professors ones conducting research actually contribute society dumbass. Shields protect eyes how's why's known awhile. forgot Monday-Tuesday lag Wednesday bump. one scenario completely work covid. could get symptoms pass 2 weeks even realizing it, could never show symptoms pass exponentially prime around. bigger population live bigger exposure. question. professionals predict need stay home quarantining ? Well duh. risk people already died! Great job killing people early New York. 
Florida right behind districts could definitely pretty fast, infrastructure designed already. sister’s district subs sign shifts want app district that’s like Uber. pretty much already use exclusively subs there’s rarely times can’t fill everyone wants full time hours. don’t get benefits all. needs upvoted more. quite successful countries, shied away recommending community overall unless situation proper mask protocol practical, usually case. done much better “stick cloth face cool” strategy. strategy overselling effectiveness try get people wear them, inadvertently convincing people acceptable substitute SD.

Their results, like Canada, Denmark, Finland, Norway, speak themselves. Well let’s say one doubling consistent increase would agree didn’t drop substantially right before.

It’s actually really hard define exactly spike be.

Like hit 20x deaths day two would still consider spike even went right away. Convinced 50% country live alone

Ehhh. Elderly likely less dependent children. evidence protests contributed increase cases. That's dumbed bit much. Cloth masks show evidence providing protection wearer others, several doctors spoke (I recently surgery) noted surgical masks primary purpose protect patient's body medical staff's germs rather way around. N95 masks really masks designed protect wearer surgical cloth masks.

That said, evidence (though almost studies cloth masks available) indicate even masks can't stop virus, decrease amount viral load body (I.E. # virus particles enter system) level *might* allow body develop antibodies without infection.

For example, noroviruses (stomach flu) require little virus get sick mask probably much help (ignoring fact infects digestive system anyway). SARS-CoV-2 virus requires lot virus cause COVID-19 (if understanding correct learned anything new since then) such, clean cloth mask provide least protection around you. But, primary protection still people mask limits amount range droplets coming nose/mouth assumed start. Well least time set testing &amp; contact tracing, well remodelling &amp; start physical school day 86 87 (taking possible snow days account). Maybe plan January start everything place &amp; heavily enforce distancing &amp; masks community. Pump full side effects fatigue, muscle aches etc etc _**And wash hands soap regularly! ALWAYS touching face too!**_ Someone shot still advance, shootings result instant death like ""Many peers believe grandma stay home, safe, groceries delivered via one numerous options available family, allowing peers live lives!""

Seriously: hearing people Maryland lots love parents **and elderly Maryland!**

People tired ""We limit lives harm might come Grandma/Grandpa!"" unless one situation: Living home elderly parents visiting regular basis. really hope recover country honestly Trump not, headed direction since inception FOX News.

Its pretty sad response worse say, Vietnam. due respect course, Vietnam fucking schooling us pandemic handling. August 15th

That's month watch trend rise killing 10s thousands fellow Americans seem zero compassion for. 

I guarantee number deaths first 2 weeks august minimum 50-75% higher last 2 weeks June. 

RemindMe! 1 month get u/pinner52 apologize apathy Ok good... want make sure Trump can't claim cases final word ""statistics"" Oh yes. Everyone bang job making decisions data. Trusting data. Listening data. 

Please tell data article informs decisions. I've reading reports (not media source) months now, article error waste paper. talking! Ok then, income taxed income. They're used interchangeably common verbatim, lol. point still stands failed address point. probably fractured femur fall rollerblades (was going 15 mph lost traction road). hematoma still size baseball week. day happened much agony swelling felt like going pass out, almost accidentally shifted weight onto it. Even then, never considered going ER. Yes. dont watch shit. mask less protecting protecting others you. Okay. Let's try something. Let's consider Chinese authoritarian communism vs American pluralism John Locke's social liberalism. Let's, sake argument, consider equally valid. China contained virus. American not. take emotional jarring away 1950s McCarty-era sentiments communism simply look data - makes sense. China lying ""authoritarian"" policies dragging people homes hospitals, welding apartment building doors shut actually worked.

But unpopular opinion Chinese communism works containing viruses. real unpopular opinion coming months social distancing mask usage failed American policy. virus explodes people gathered large groups (i.e. see spike Disney World guests coming weeks) regardless mask usage/social distancing ***regulations***, Americans still ***in practice*** stand close together wear masks around necks. (Watch tweets images Disney World Orlando example) 

Personally, think social policy effect follows: American leaders live pluralist society ultimately care welfare American public live outside social status (the fuck-all-immigrants, fuck-outsiders mentality). Homogenous societies Asia actually care (Japan, China, Korea) welfare see country family brothers. read report Thailand foreign nationals get infected, public hospitals Bangkok taken care Japanese national Vietnamese national free. That's unheard for-profit American medical industry. complicated nations, draconian laws work could never work ultimately Mitch McConnell's constituents would roast alive found assisted people whose skin color white religion Christian.   state cases yes... 🎼 “ Nobody likes me, everybody hates me, I’m going eat worms” 🎼

Me - resident NC they’re going open Disneyland this, murica Yeah they’re place didn’t effectively flatten curve Wait got bonuses. got told ""be thankful still job."" Xi largely successful. Trump moron. absolutely dumbfounded Im excited...reddit please explain settle temper expectations. great read Feel like people entitled. Using stupid constitution rights attempt validate argument mask orders shocks see dumb country rlly is. wait people drop dead group realize soon almost like Herd Immunity works way viruses work. someone lives US, I'd like say this: 


The USA developed perspective corporations. entire system rigged make money putting people first. shit hit fan people need put first, work system support without people. Money rig doomed. People selfish/have ""rugged individualism"" attitude states messaging profoundly positive effect. don’t like mask feels, you’re definitely gonna like getting intubated. 

I don’t like seatbelts feel, it’s better feeling going windshield. stopped drink coffee. pic taken democratic fundraiser guy. 

He's wearing one. He's stupid supporting hairdresser lady, wearing mask good news aware sub allow altered headlines (Rule 2). likely cause post deleted, unfortunately. happen please repost unaltered title. well everyone sub pretty squirrelly moment understand people going little nuts post! unfortunately, false SARS Ro greater \~50% barrier effect masks provide. 

in words; people continue spreads SARS causing accelerating deaths even everyone wears mask.

this link provides interactive details; Dr. Birx complained hospitals adequately reporting data, convened working group government hospital officials devised new plan, according Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer Association American Medical Colleges, participated.

I remember Birx talking issue months ago usually report Sundays. people would get data states pretty much every state reporting data unique way. would spend hours recompiling data hand time automate process automate process. remember explaining sometimes receive states data 2 3 morning. Saturday/Sunday typically day let people rest process Monday/Tuesday usually worst comes reporting. optimistic part saying way streamline data make process tolerable faster.


HOWEVER, cynical part says they're know next weeks situation going get much much worse. want get data ASAP public spin anyone else chance so. Ok going call strangers see store wearing mask. people helpless lunatics weapon hand. else going ""sacrifice lives Economy."" (Texas lt Governor). dragging feet next steps stay tuned numbers. Im pretty sure competition Florida Texas. 🤦 D. Jackson says all. Everything need know. 

And no, I'm racist all. 

I see looting destroying hard working buiness owners, see actual protesting. Common sense America hard come by. mean pretty clear. made millions dollars instead losing millions dollars. ""I sure, many Trump-Fans listen finally correct sensible thing.
That help change course pandemic.""

Narrator: ""They didn't"" Someone analysed function crematoria said numbers bodies burned much higher reported. People criticized analysis pointing crematoria burning bodies also medical waste PPEs, assumed contaminated burning safety disposal time. also burning 24/7 paper assumed. paper debate interested. Nature research article found antibody prevalence Wuhan around 3.5%, around 385,000 people city 11 million infected. 4k estimated died Covid, generate incident fatality rate 1%, little lower IFR Spain New York, would expected least little higher treatments pretty rudimentary days, could sampling bias due fact Chinese elders packed together nursing homes, primary driver death NY Spain. could some, maybe factor 1.5 2, think 10 100. Still kind crazy. Imagine soldier asked take vaccine gone testing yet. That's going lower ""morale"" tad. literally everyone liar according admin.

i'm sure there's they've accused.

but Trump tells truth always right. Like said cases zero soon. wrong

 **Face coverings required bus school** 
The best way slow transmission COVID-19 school setting require staff students wear face coverings throughout day. Pre-K second grade students issued clear plastic face shield, may used addition instead cloth face covering. sister sub Texas, district gone pretty much exclusively subs. app like Uber go schedule shifts/days want. Nobody permanent classroom anymore really, take cart room room. None benefits. haven’t hired permanent teachers couple years. Yup. bigger fear hospital NY run profofol.

If you’re one people self ownership need do, expect 99% world stop they’re go life care free. time, good news. Depends course disease, age patient, etc. symptoms would experience would lead people hospital pretty quickly. 
Just like pandemic, one size fits answer solution. tend worry less diseases easily identified curable (not treatable). We’ve bubonic plague lock while.

Edit: Concomitant pneumonia COVID plague could nasty, that’s going rare. Yersinia isn’t nearly infectious sars-cov2. Prove it. remember ten years ago people looked like two heads mentioned avocados toast, one favorite breakfasts since could remember.


Now apparently rest generation can't afford homes healthcare. Thank you! shithole countries sending best almost ran out. Doctors/Pharmacists looking older therapies could used alternatives. 

We enough Propofol Precedex last while, scared wouldn't. hard separate human nature behavior ingrained societies. Human history full sociopaths willing anything benefit others expense, also full people making ultimate sacrifice others personal benefit.

I say seems like Eastern Cultures (see Japan, Korea, etc.) seem able elicit high levels cooperation things like mask-wearing great effect without strict law enforcement.

Western cultures individualistic US home Outlaw cowboys Ayn Rand seems take next level. Covid-19 vaccine led patients produce antibodies neutralize novel coronavirus causes disease, though caused minor side effects many patients, according first published data early-stage trial experimental shot.

Side 100–microgram dose, one Moderna advancing larger trials, 15 patients experienced side effects, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain, pain site injection. side effects considered mild moderate.

This test vaccines seriously giving higher, 250-microgram dose led serious reactions set aside. Although side effects severe — meaning required hospitalization Probably lying media helping cover it.

NY 32,000 deaths, dwarfs every state. Cuomo royally fucked city. surely stop American COVID cases going US losing respect leadership throughout world. guess there’s chance turn around then. 😞 tell me. National Geographic article, think it’s behind paywall used alternate link, recommending guy mentioned negotiation tactic agreeing certain points first (i.e. “I understand you’re coming from, it’s hard believe anything mainstream anymore, look nonsense hydroxychloroquine covid-19”), trying offer new information (i.e. “Have seen article 140k people dying measles due lack vaccination? surprised many died, We’re swingers? like dinner parties happy hours friends it’s scaled visiting one household time moved outside Also see: point kindergarten?

I'm looking someone challenge theory try understand feel 'truly' happening there. Many people saying months now: Herd inmunity real solution vaccine created.  going Lindsey Graham? simple fix this... (in US, anyway)

Why one post updated OSHA regulations concerning this?!

OSHA explicitly states *the employer’s obligation protect employees harm work*. I’m sorry *ma’am*, would love let in, could jeopardize employee’s health expose fines and/or litigation. 

Case closed. Questions? Google OSHA + COVID. 

Need TL:DR? Google OSHA general duty clause.

Your “liberties” jeopardizing health others. Pretend COVID exist want. Pretend pretend degrees human biology make better rest us. Pretend ‘herd immunity’ works way say pretend royalty... DON’T CARE! 

I quote federal regulation trumps *anything fantasies dream up*

#Now put damned mask! Commically top doom hyperbole here. here's make better

Have ever watched press conference read watched copious [technical telling us make better exactly since January. problem listening.

WHO one best resources available regarding health issues international concern. Seriously. Check country never million years thought would deal Ebola -- identify dozen cases? covered. Everything [safe dignified provide guidance kinds public health issues.

The whole point compile analyze data develop guidance member states. problem them. us. look it. Idiocracy crept us much quieter think people imagined. 

A lot us knew built house cards though. Mind blowing stupidity everywhere. COVID make penalty stupidity much immediate. lock grandparents nursing homes us grew far away grandparents. It’s part capitalist American culture, don’t strong extended families. Doesn’t help grandparents trump loving ignorant complain wearing masks. something love make enough money support yoruself, great. That's be. I'm specifically talking people major gender studies, art, photography whatever complain making enough job. real school, also small institution rural northeast US... 1200 students pre-rona. financial situation dire, putting incredible amount resources toward infrastructure able offer almost everything online person students choose modality they're comfortable given state things, inability guarantee safety spite efforts.

Before COVID, already pursuing competency-based education initiatives, still common across US, we're hoping position improved institutions likely looking new ways compete. Also ton opportunities high school students earn early college credit next nothing.

Giving away name would likely give away identity anyone working it. really interested, I'll send PM... I'm happy answer questions PM. Bad bot. Yikes, I'm definitely advocate current economy. I'm also advocate massive inflation uncontrolled economic collapse. assume there's middle ground, that's hard find Internet forum. already feel average IQ country rising. hospitals eating costs without guarantee proportionate compensation. 

Insurance dodge payouts, they're great that. Either denying claims defending red tape hydra-style subsidiary bankruptcies upward liability shielding. one way other, they'll jack premiums much (already are) keep bottom line looking good. make Insurance inaccessible wide swath people. care.

Insurance companies take hit pay well they'll live pay nearly much should. also decade eat costs defer disrupt repayment/class action long.

Insurance obligation pay hospitals enough corona treatments hospitals survive. won't.

Bottom line this: shittiest moment human history hospital business. Companies going start getting it. cook KFC years high school. Even never messed someones food. Also hit floor went trash. said still never sent food drink back wrong. Even though never spit persons food, know happens especially send food back ""It's back square one"" worse.

Ideally, could help sufficient resources enforce mandatory mask-wearing/social distancing mandatory weekly COVID-19 testing all. serious? 1k dead per day Brazil? making Ebola seem like runny nose. imagine breaking hard red light hear massive crash trailer? know, dark, it’s coping mechanism.  Ok, question on-going school year debate:

Why people resistant AAP's recommendation open schools?

As group Pediatrics, probably data us how/what children deal physical mental health stance since Pandemic begun may inform recommending schools open open.

* one hand, very, real risk children carrying COVID-19 home at-risk family members school teachers.
* hand, very, real risks children families parts country simply cannot function without schools session. Namely either Rural areas poverty-stricken areas cities. Specifically follows time away school associated interruption supportive services often results social isolation, making difficult schools identify address important learning deficits well child adolescent physical sexual abuse, substance use, depression, suicidal ideation. This, turn, places children adolescents considerable risk morbidity and, cases, mortality. Beyond educational impact social impact school closures, substantial impact food security physical activity children families.

* know can't stop COVID-19, slow (which turn also lengthens pandemic). also know that, short miracle, achieving herd immunity getting vaccine anytime soon.

So question risks concerned about? important - particular topic:

1. Slowing COVID (as can't stop it) accepting risk lower income/rural families?
2. Accepting COVID risk best mitigate risk at-risk teachers family members?
3. option still needs considered?

Note even bring students Mental Health disabilities largely reliant schooling caregivers well-being..... address fact lot people groups (poverty rural) also access broadband necessary online learning.

And people everywhere still playing game ""Listen experts/doctors/scientists! (except like say"")? 


Can really say ""#BlackLivesMatter"" make greatest risk groups schools open? mean struggle critical thinking, yes, many do.

Yes, proves point. blame ""the system,"" really, come student herself. Blaming ""the system"" actively participating shows hypocritical. Americans seriously dumbest mutuerfuckers planet. much changing people's minds wearing masks, Robb Willer Matt Feinberg done research changing people's minds stuff. shown something called moral reframing works. it, take moral value important person tie issue want focus on. talk apply idea youtube video book:  Maine cases I’m scared go due weak health. Good job New York! news vaccine yet? IDK NFL gets ton money TV deals think fans allowed Linc really hurt much. supposed Transatlantic cruise October NYC UK. way put foot countries idiotic re-openings Healthcare system.

Doubt democratic country's supply chain could handle shit.  seriously think cases keep increasing without raising demand hospital resources?

I good authority additional cases due additional testing. authority, anyway... Left half graph north, second half south, look who's winning! american population like 3 year old, ""no"" responded ""you can't make me"" they'll exact opposite thing unless beat ass establish consequences. encourage businesses require mask recieve service... pretty simple fix nobody right justify business choosing want serve. Slap face argument Eagles fans fucking bonkers, week I'd daresay they're even half insane players team. One time got subway car dude wearing MAGA hat, spent whole ride side-eying him. looked frightened, I'm sure he'd spent day (in New York City) stared at.  Maybe CA, Florida going get worse even NYC though, gotten already. Meanwhile, idiots Orange County, California voting return school masks social distancing. Could reason cases spiking here?
It unbelievable people understanding reasoning. Get mask face. stop madness.

Edit add: clarify: Katie O’Mara Lactation consultant registered dietician south Orange County taken upon anti-vax anti-mask friends push dangerous agenda board. claims fighting choice return school teachers students wear masks social distance, would like know exactly many teachers would willingly choose return school without safety measures place. teacher willing sacrifice life lives families work entitled parents raising children disregard science common decency global pandemic? First comment removed automod ""incivility"". Edited:

If best excuse something puts people risk ""it's illegal"", a**--uh, big mean jerk**.

God forbid call totally-human Ted Cruz is. can’t recall impeach someone hunch can’t done quickly. needs facts gathering evidence trial sort. saw long took result months ago different issue. 

Imagine sitting governor say n-word public right now. long think he/she remain office forced resign? think option wait next election? 

The fact calls resignation makes one wonder. negative coverage echo chamber? No, ~18% antibodies NYC, ~13% overall state. Doctors stated again, EVERYONE GOING GET THIS. contagious, never successful vaccine coronavirus.

The point SLOW SPREAD, stop it.

And places get hot summer going spike summer beginning this.

I understand everyone flabbergasted developments. follows logic. Yeah, covid infection absolutely nothing like cancer diagnosis. anyone even pay attention asshole anymore? He's irrelevant decade now. Wait, Lindsey Graham openly disagreeing President? smelling defeat November? posting snarky internet comments, done improve situation?

Genuinely curious. man said exemption governor's order, lifted shirt revealed gun holster upon hip

I wonder edgy tough felt brandished gun like 17 year old that's job. 100% rehearsed beforehand walking businesses looking conflict. manchild loser. shame people need hear message types places message circulated. Turns low infection rates country makes harder virus spread.

We pretty bad numbers back February, Germans Freedumb Party thing. easing now, masks place public, indoor areas still mandatory wont get pleasant request leave building take mask off, leaving building. thing know future holds, mask, lockdown, etc we're Donner party choosing still make trip, time, changes whatsoever much.

 

**Food Coronavirus Disease 2019 evidence suggest handling food consuming food associated COVID-19. coronavirus news. **When cases finally dropped due lockdown:**

Massachusetts/New York: ""Cool, bro! Lets keep using common sense following safety standards vaccine.""

Texas/Florida/Arizona: ""It aints evan bad hear! aintz understand gotz wer dat der mask. MUH FREEDOMS!!""

And see results... Um, firstly, ""4.0 GPA"" Europe unless specifically attend American-style school. Secondly, country system. France, instance, give perfect scores unless something like mathematics computer science. 

Perhaps same, clearly full crap. lost almost 50k people combined thing. That’s nothing celebrate Stand line bunch people think may covid take test may may accurately measure infected 48+ hours ago. 

Seems legit. Montana 1800 active cases per million. North Dakota 4800 per million. similar total population density, I'd think. difficulty believing online classes inherently worse. classes lectures never used 1 1 times professors. think online classes good.

I've also taken additional courses strictly online they're exceptionally good, quite expensive, worth it.

I know Georgia started increasing fees instead tuition HOPE scholarship never covered fees (only tuition) going bankrupt. might they're still charging fees, that's pathetic reason. Fees charged online schools. workarounds tho: put filter that's circulating air outside oxygenate bubble simultaneously mask without worry whole kid fiddling mask issue, place items kid needs day bubble need take place objects bubble afterwards.

Granted I'm aware kind idea silly, image teaching 30 bubbled kids amusing me, hoping total ppe compliance actual kids adults dont manage also isnt cost effective long run.

Edit: decided quick search inflatable balls walk go for, 200 dollars. Pretending personal filtering unit costs around 100 more, one break payments school year terrible investment. Again, I'm completely serious, I'd support something like this. really go hospital talk cv19 patients face face teach adapt coronavirus. /s Natural solution vaccine. can't hide forever. Life always risks. G We’re mega fucked. I’m glad see agree, turned lot better hoped lol. Thank renewing faith humanity. Yeah that's thought. Like I'm happy got experimental data it, damn sick go home! swine flu apparently 18k confirmed deaths.

Most people seem realize this. get flu numbers excess deaths, confirmed cases. comparing CONFIRMED COVID-19 cases ESTIMATED flu numbers, like article done bogus way measuring it. wonder accurate really day 1 global scale ignorant believe many people wearing masks. That’s amazing news! *big fat* idiot. “If we’re gonna troubled! get kiss wife” never would've believed we'd ever reach 800 cases day time nearly 800 deaths day. Elective procedures typically hospitals make money. Treating masses people coming ER typically doesn't. 

If big dollar elective surgeries bringing much money also maxing staffing. Possibly hire traveling employees drop off. 

I say going bankrupt, definitely losing money. Clearly, sample random participants could decide whether opt out.

Samples random. Otherwise, cannot assumed match population. Stats 101. much so. coworkers quoting statistics information March. Yes, jewelry 50% Europe. friends skincare fragrances can’t keep demand Every time see ask question.

What better choice?

We covid epicenter world. federal response, testing, nearly enough PPE.

Hospitals overrun.

Trump’s CDC said send back did. 

Cuomos perfect untested waters completely failed federal response. 

What better option? can’t send home. cant keep hospitals indefinitely limited beds increased infections. 

What better option? I’d love hear it. RISK food handling? risk others eating food someone *may* exposed prepared? Thanks Yep, still people Mass throwing fit too. many residents calling mayor dumbass, can’t even see actions prevented bad situation. luckily, smart people outweigh dumb, we’ve able clamp virus thankfully.  ... except initial upward trend? Lmfao Missing year socialization key ages may lifetime impacts.

Becoming infected, infecting others, particularly caretakers, pandemic also lifetime impacts. hate this. Young Americans: get decent college degree case feel need get hell here. Healthy paws Llama Pharma, need drama NY lot people punched asian cause asians wore mask three months ago..  American thing. happens everywhere. countries, actual laws actual enforcement, rely ""common sense"" ""morality"". example, Germany. I’d say it’s time serve plate broiled Rush it’s obvious meat spoiled long time ago. shields gonna get nasty quickly. Imagine snot, phlegm. mucus know else things....who going clean them? seriously?

&amp;#x200B;

If hell serving? Sweden also much greater spread measures taken anywhere Scandinavia

You mean risk community spread [very  

Quick, downvote me. forget California! Thanks answering. I've never worked medical field I'm curious, reason hospital's cross-train nurses? pay issue? Whatever gets approved available everyone right away. people worried vaccine rushed safe, people probably first wave vaccinations anyway. get it, people want it.

It's probably problem 6 months initial release, expect lot people either get board basically never will. would think would perfect opportunity anti Vax movement destroyed, bunch nutjobs think mask killing them. useless many might buying whole ""The fragrance kills CoVid-19!"" stuff going around internet. Yeah, hence barely communicate. okay, zoomer. undercut someone gravitas untarnished reputation. 

So no, message originating WH going gain traction. escape California? I've honestly lost faith people here. Governor issued another shutdown, office non-essential work ""those poor businesses"".  say thing

we make room smell like cake

that's live NY/NJ amount friends social media partying semi large groups 10 without masks social distancing astonishing. invited “beer bash” weekend people 25 people RSVP’d far. swiftly declined lol person hosting works hospital well graduated Masters. would thought would common sense guess takes kinds lol Oh interesting, getting pretty wild perspective American society right I'd imagine.

But collectivist vs. individualist spectrum something describes responsible individuals society feel towards actively contributing society, even something directly benefits them. see individualist part US pretty easily right I'd argue far end spectrum. simplified version individualism people put well-being needs well-being needs neighbors, fellow towns folk, fellow citizens, ect. see predominantly US people say 'I wanna wear mask, catch it, catch it.' attitude completely ignores fact whole reason people wearing masks protect people. justify 'muh freedom'. Also, general hostility amongst conservative Americans towards type social programs US, like universal healthcare free tuition, another good example. Funding programs beneficial everyone, even attend university go hospital frequently. conservatives argue 'you shoulda made better decisions saved money medical bills' completely ignoring approach hurts society since got huge proportion population using disposable income cover medical bills tuition, rather using money invest, buy shit, support local businesses, ect. also even touch fucked people believe Healthcare privilege right.

In terms collectivism, opposite. far end spectrum, people make value well-being well-being completely. extreme collectivist society really exist, East Asian countries tend embrace collectivism countries though. far end either side spectrum great thing though, gotta mix individualistic collectivist values. comes Germany, slightly lesser degree developed Western countries US, people understand value paying higher taxes fund robust social safety nets. obviously lot examples this, one always like Germany people get pissed walk across street red. happens time countries, including US, still taboo Germany, especially amongst older generation, people believe type behavior cause children run traffic.

 Idk, things I've noticed, perspective well? like say US people assume everything allowed proven otherwise, Germany people assume everything forbidden unless told otherwise. stressed could something it. Yikes. wtf pregnant current condition? Y’all basically asking handouts you? Yeah one time machine AKA Maskholes. (Not neologism liked it). ""may"" Thing called adrenaline. People really underestimate people capable bleeding out. Remember couple weeks ago idiots commenting “cases rising deaths aren’t.”

Well, go. mean... that's said though. implied commenter saying that.

I also garauntee racism (especially black brown folks) exists systemic level. mean people outright throwing racial slurs (although small amount people anyway), treatment regard employment, hospital stays, applying loans, etc. data there, too. really feel like going full-scale debate though I'm sure find others argue with. thought I'd give $.02.

Also, take time conversation two black folks. Let speak, let explain is. anything, give perspective situation. good day! ignorance + confidence impressive.

I tell typical conversation people used to.

I tell people gets shut down

I ramble peer reviews come back outdated peer reviewed x arguing waste time.

People want lectured, people want told do.

But care want, seem care making feel good lack ability get people things want 

People like part people wear masks all. several members department working change it.

But maybe missed nuance. Roche’s response COVID-19 Bro got embarrassed, save pearl clutching. people dont trust media right wing... media (fox) worst. trust Teds people found real problem. Ok Bs here, won’t let us go back work, I’m mechanic bowling alley, 600 kept afloat pay bills rent, blowing hundreds things don’t need. stop might well die. I’ve job 20 years, get 290 regular unemployment. That’s gonna work. I’m caught inbetween governor hard spot. magazine think they’re doing? Publishing 3 month old information.....

Oh wait. Facts care personal attacks opinion. change, facts facts. happened, try actually reading it. see next week two. Guilt paralyzes. Social pressure works ""group"" one buy into. effective use underlying values make case.  best comment I've read Reddit. Ever.

I've laughing three minutes straight.

Be safe /u/lord_covidton Oh yea, turn cannibalism. right wing talk show hosts lovely plans society. Texas letting new teachers get hired without even passing competency exams.  Add USA list. We're fucking bad decent number people literally fucking dumb think ignore reality repercussions. even done yet. Stay tuned! FloridOOF. fuck shitty grammar proof point. literally survived situation thought relative ease. todays news: believe wonders, magic fairy tales everything happen done. Sincerly,
 rest world. this. keep voting people fund war military indefinitely. meanwhile even masks!

hopefully people ask *what want elected officials do* think long hard voting internal politics many universities (and industry!) suggests even older folks can't consistently.

Oh gawd, really going say social skills ACADEMIA INDUSTRY? even close! willfully comparing apples grapefruit last-ditch effort show students irresponsible. Academics notoriously inept comes interpersonal skills....notoriously. I'm saying backstabbing, etc., happen corporate world, ramifications frankly exist academia. Internal academic politics Ivory Tower comparably small. mean, dude, get real.

You addressed original point, students social butterflies still suck working groups toward goal. suck parents, least write professional email. I’m real curious south react football inevitably cancelled. NY proves along social distancing works. morons still call hoax blows mind.  Seriously it’s getting ridiculous. say wtf. Key difference could government shut non-essential industries.
Essential services strict sop.
Shut parties/bars prevent irresponsible folks going.
Set fine whoever goes outside without valid reason. Set police blockades prevent people traveling districts.
Mandatory masks anyone needs go outside groceries medicines etc.
Schools due open next week delayed another 2 weeks new cases recently. heavy enforcement possible. reason countries successful compliance. beyond science first smell blood water. get long term and/or permanent damage catching recovering.

As I. statement, others like it, overstate reality, bad people saying problem all. Let numbers speak themselves. reality is, young pre-existing conditions, likely going require hospitalization, likely little consequences it. decide risk tolerances, making everyone think certain death disablement, even people pre-existing conditions, ridiculous saying risk, especially pre-existing conditions.   You’re arguing point I’m making. Hope funding orphanages... know ""For 1/100th time"" tweet day grasp fractions, guess notion ""per capita"" understood comes surprise. north OC. Less Karens here! took sample Worldometers 7 day average death rate CA, FL, entire US taking noticeable trend upward (and CA FL reaching highest rate they've ever had): post stated take awhile deaths actually show states like NJ reporting deaths *May* right now. deaths happening they're showing up, ""going down"" say. Deaths trending poor direction never claimed entirety would visible 2 days... already showing indications getting ""spike"" asking for.

For real demonstration graph likely look, check graph Florida hospitalizations deaths mapped infection likely occurred closely mirrors curve cases, see spike occuring: Thank thats much better explanation name calling lol. figured mask act blocker self. Like mouth shield, dint really think spray preventer. 

Idk still view selfish. think health want it. get saying putting every one esle danger. logic, still sneezing hands cars takeing inside stores touch things. 

That's beleive better mandate would wear mask want protect self. give television mini commercials made gocerment showing wash groceries disinfect things get home. 

I work life saving industry self, im emt, certifications chemical warfare. guess I've seen much worse stuff less protection mandates. Here’s source no. 1, asked. source Northwestern Memorial no. 2, see Florida’s health care system. currently saturated. am. 3 year old 5 year old (who's supposed start school year).

We answers either, add. wife still discussing kids. responsibility capability so. lot people freedom have. 


My wife also backgrounds science, particularly Wife Biology degree Masters Public Health. So, despite concern, tend defer experts (pediatricians, doctors, virologists, etc) looking overall risks. Let's open schools Yea, China definitely honest. Though, countries 100% honest   deaths high need refrigerator trucks? see high worldometers website f\*cking country, man. swear god. *We’ll back two two hundred thousand deaths.* [H1N1 first detected humans Please spread lies disinformation. fact rewrite history fit narrative quite telling surprising given racist tone beginning. whole state floundering pandemic root cowboys. 

Go Birds. too! Meh. stopped shopping like 15 years ago.

Note: Idiot downvoters, never said word refusing wear mask. always wear mask, moreso respect retail employees, feel front liners. 

I stopped shopping best buy years ago discovered amazon early. Plus worked Best Buy, biggest assholes ever met. Completely changed view them. Fuck Best Buy. fine. wait tomorrow's 8,000 fresh cases. feeling anti-mask crowd whipped frenzy it'll take massive forcing mechanism get wear masks. feel like politicians opened Pandora's box. wanted get drunk fingerbang Jenny hallway! Keep dreaming. ""Mah rights!"" probably second dumbest thing Idahoan ever thought  Roche tests Peer pressure works see people peers. ""peers"" wearing masks, wear masks. someone anti-mask already, pro-mask peer. 

What might work a) focus Trump others WH wearing masks getting tested time b) give masks reinforce values feel important - like mask American flag. heard story Reddit someone whose neighbor lived state forced buy mask even though anti-mask, bought one flag thinks looks ""cute"".  That's one example technique work:  ""Good News"" flair cause cuomo doesn’t anyone left eradicate nursing homes? Sure dear, amazed cult worshiping politicians US cost ignore facts reality.

&amp;#x200B;

Just stay safe, country turning complete catastrophe rate, next month going total disaster. 

&amp;#x200B;

Please blame Mexicans media loved ones get sick die. could predicted except leading scientists world? ~~That’s chump change. Florida we’re pushing 15 thou’. C’mon, Brazil. Step up. /s~~

EDIT: I’m sorry. totally missed said deaths. thought said cases. Read fast. Wow. 1,000 deaths day incredibly bad. stupid fuckwads south Midwest start coming vacations shit. I’ve read accounts people north east talking friends family going CA FL vacations coming back here. feel like another months NY/NJ hit April numbers easily.  Damn, never would though Muslims free speech. Crazy! many ""other"" dead per day Florida. whims trump needs others.

Got questions? Scream “fire” crowded theater.

See gets you. would say FU report usual also crazy short sighted. big cost temporary shut down, people spend decades disability ""recovery"". know someone living lung scarring, easy thing. Tics need grass live city probably outside. Soap changes water tension lift junk germs skin washed away. soap much actually \*kill\* bacteria, dose Purell help kill anything soaping left behind. Caravan say? Trump gonna build wall call rapists terrorists. It’s election year all. That's Alex Jones American police trained hesitate kill first believe point could danger. also trained way every situation overwhelming force needed. Literally son riding bike home work day works graveyards got stopped one two 5 police cruisers riding bike street said drug activity. Ie, live liberal, urban environment state one liberal areas country (Madison) seeing 50% mask usage. rest state outside Milwaukee maybe like 10%. Maybe. 

Dane, Milwaukee, Door County (because tourists) best this.  Read wrote before. recommendations visitations multiple municipalities implemented restrictions. 31st March set nation-wide ban visitations.

Is PPE relevant complaint strategy applied since start ""stricter stricter restrictions""? still given example this. March soft, harden? Cause examples shown show got looser. 

And think Prime Minister speaking seriously this, heard speech 22nd March - No, actually take page Canada’s book ask people nicely, please quarantine, wouldja?  Little late game, no? Good idea, know 'anti-masks' nonsense opening act real luddite lunacy play vaccine actually gets here.  Meanwhile country, schools scheduled reopen week pushed back 2 weeks due new cases. 
Why American government hell bent reopening schools? tag probably. would tagged United States.  Trump Co.: Goddamn feriners !

Foreign donors: ORLY? kiss billions dollars goodbye. 

Trump Co.: ...... self-consciousness guess. But, better know, think. there's start lag deaths. Gets outrageous. died DEFENDING FREEDOMS. moral equivalent WWII soldier. RIP Cubans vote conservative. voting patterns completely different Hispanic groups. [A majority Cuban-Americans voted governor fucking idiot that's how. March bare minimum reopen cities scrambling implement orders, April bitched cities enforcing orders praised people defied orders (at least one directly associated political group), May aggressively reopened weekly cadence sending orders mayors tried enforce mask ordinances, spent June bitching everybody's fault. lt governor literally said ""there important things dying"" hurt economy. past weeks closed bars (note: restaurants, churches, whole lot things still open) required masks (but still let counties opt enforcing it). TEA requiring schools reopen anyone wants come back elearning. state government fucking bad would think want kill people.

And know what? 30% disapprove he's handling virus. Somewhere close 50% approve. great irony that, someone lives state that's well, much freedom right now. 

My kids saw three friends today went swimming, done within rules social distancing masks.

They're summer. global pandemic global demand vaccine. one created take months get packed shipped locations need it.

Glad wearing mask. Good luck you. Death outcome care it’s reliable metric determine bad things are.

Elon cares car deliveries. Yeah 99.9% people hear see quote headline sub. G P policy like Alferd Packer preemtively killed ate fellow travelers necessary. 

Except actually punished sees writing wall wants distance administration okay :( Ohhhhhh I'm confused 😵 I'm expert, AFAIK length time presence antibodies correlates severity immune response - people severe disease seem antibodies stick around longer milder cases. vaccine provoke strong immune response, may get protection lasts - hopefully least year.

As ADE, far evidence ADE vaccine candidates. definitely useful, that's comparisons thst generate clicksm  Says yo-yo making baseless claims....... Actual title: _Coronavirus: possible get infected multiple times?_

Can please stop edited titles? sub going downhill garbage people injecting. “miracles” happen. Germany low infection rate. also travel ban America high infection rate.  Dear World,

Please send help. held captive morons. 
If science textbooks preteens send ‘em over: information books that’s standing us medical catastrophe. 

xoxo politician bring snowball outside proof global warming isn’t happening.

And honestly, engineer must commend dedication scientific method. man chose trust silly books literature instead DARED think /s pay issue, knowledge issue. Nursing school teaches basic nursing knowledge working teaches nitty-gritty specialty. equipment used procedures happen hospitals often extremely complicated take months cross-train. country cops shoot people leg strategy non lethal force? Lol terrible That's even close true. issue one press briefing, leads talk hour, gets distilled headlines (often mischaracterized) published around world posted repeatedly. Unless watching actual briefings idea substance provided. responsible happens COVID gets inside country kind like made movie combination 'Contagion' 'Idiocracy' except entertaining funny, runtime 6 hrs long. That's reality we're living in. administration use push school reopenings...  Pearl clutching best. Partial immunity due T-Cell interaction would result mild case, would still allow virus spread vulnerable people, right? someone can't work unsafe receive benefits keep fed.

When ever say that? said system place help TRULY cannot work. right large group healthy people refuse work due extra get unemployment. let's continue ignore that. seem like teachers would starve either way. one would rather die.

Sure hope not. know try make seem like want work.  There's hope see headline again. biology mathematics. Remember name come time vote. really bothers antimask freedom groups almost certainly buying propaganda places would love see America fail. man speaks truth. There's nothing Best Buy can't get cheaper Amazon. reason buy something Best Buy absolutely need minute can't wait Prime. Like yeah, I'll pay $20 extra video game Christmas Eve ordered weeks ago lazy. I'll pay $10 extra HDMI cable TV needs work tonight. that's really it. farthest edges subject virus mentioned. kinda slow? Lol, that's hysterical 

Yes, I'm Seattle. tell I'm from. Well certainly negative pressure eat meat? drink alcohol? still far likely die heart conditions cancer, yet 20% country morbidly obese. 

It's fine protect yourself. say death dismemberment sentence without pre-existing condition fear mongering. sad friend died, extend condolences. statistical outlier. know three people died it. Two pre-existing conditions knew of, third 78 years old, likely too. reality probably outliers. said, unless something changes drastically country, still good deal likely die heart disease cancer. *everything* power protect those? See bad mod bot. I’m adult enough get bent shape dude’s perceived incivility. It’s actually insulting sub seems think needs protect us mean people.

Just letting yall know problem reddit needs work on. someone mild symptoms- tests positive- recovers fully within 10 days- tests negative, safe assume longer infectious? Thank much, that's exactly kind article looking for! lol. thinking like going get thousands killed US.

Im sure getting data stats arn't quite correct. 

You cherry picked lowest 3 days every week. Sat, Sun, Mon. that's fine well use days still show increasing trend. 

July 13 465    July 6 378   465/378= 1.23

July 12 380    July 5 261   380/261= 1.455

July 11 731   July 4 265   731/265= 2.75

Total  1576   Total 904  1576/904 = 1.74

In past week comparing day week deaths increased 74%. Give another week two going see increases especially hospitals begin fill up. freezer trucks parked outside hospitals stacked bodies like NYC? Probably better treatments vents now. unnecessary death caused callous people refuse simple things like wear masks go need to? absolutely. Ahhhhhh  Anything involving immigrants, he's behind it. [It’s got plants Woooo, that's long right, they're dead trucks. usual summer flu, see Magic Kingdom! start.. watching county council meeting last night. live saint charles county directly adjacent saint louis. Saint louis county city mask mandates.. county executive reiterated last night would that. Worth noting close enough anti-maskers happily drive extra 10 mins shop without mask. meanwhile local news reporting county new hotspot metro area something like 400% increase infections last 2 weeks. county good representative see many non MAJOR urban cities counties MO even infections spike.

In meeting showed actually outbreak among county employees something like 40+ confirmed many tests pending.. meanwhile closed county offices... gone back working home done ANYTHING reverse reopening last months general public County offices. Insisting people use common sense wear masks leave individuals.

My county gonna hurting pretty bad soon.. hate passion. worked malmö bought pack different ones midsummer used give Beska Droppar Coworker Portugal. loved it. whats point No. It’s time issue. Hospitals understaffed is. ICU specialized unit requires lot critical thinking, takes time master. saying med surg nurses don’t critically think medical surg nurses newer nurses already lack due inexperience . meat pretty rancid. Thanks no. party Family Values. Tomorrow’s headlines: Caronavirus death plummet. “Winning” leading cause death. Trump right! give swedes. One absolutely highest death tolls world still insisting best strategy.
You immune reason I'm wasting time tonight.

Edit: see swedish downvoting herd arrived. sorry bunch are. Hmmmm Find winter... He's epidemiologist, listening experts. stock price worth killing employees.

Or maybe is, know, I'm Elon. sure takes two weeks virus run course lol.

4th July mass festivals tens thousands attendance, 10 person backyard parties? 10 person backyard parties Canada, could afford numbers knocked down.

and surges began two weeks protests. LA almost clear covid.

im saying cause wasnt important bonkers one admit absolutely reckless detrimental fight covid. Southern state governors I’m sure... respect that, reality science today rarely deals certainties, especially trying deal new things phenomena. often scientists researchers often hesitant make concise certain claims likely say “we believe likely” kinds language like that. say can’t form consensus “know“ things, takes long time figure things out, especially since can’t observe eyes directly. commentor included, many experts, taking precautions, don’t necessarily see need go things like groceries. anything, seems like you’re probably risk grocery store taking groceries home.

Like said before, think need safe. reason I’m commenting simply let people know don’t necessarily take quite extensive measures. you’re like me, don’t necessarily ton room let things sit well without either coming close contact near proximity them. also don’t ton money simply spend massive amounts disinfectants cleaning supplies really needed so. suspect true people, I’m necessarily knocking particular actions, want assure people likely okay takings actions you. dont know, lot's people actually like parents.  would pretty unpopular move. make $6 hour teacher? want tell people take precautions, poster maybe overblowing real world: 6 days thing one data point study also showed half life 7 hours slightly different laboratory conditions. sunlight involved, half-life minutes. like profile picture/gif actual Eagles games exempt fans allowed even says FALSE preview pic. 

However, clear white house wants allow kids staff, people spread to, die. going explicitly say that, going answer question, ""How many deaths symptomatic cases acceptable you?"", want schools open whatever happens, happens. need parents back work economy looks good election.

Also, refresh comment section find many people read articles. prime example American arrogance...this positive story health care workers **France** course made situation US instead. 

Source: American mean God believe gave us vaccines doctors reason. Faith reason follow best medical practices Actually common strains coronavirus cause colds might months immunity. know one do, worth noting reports potential reinfection already (not ones inactive virus still circulating, actual second illness).

It's clear yet virus reemerging people, really catch twice, think bears Excellent policies. based China South Korea? Betsy devos trying privatize schools bascically funneling money meant public schools private schools. giant donor trump campaign since billionaire. Also brother founded blackwater, maybe there's plans increased privatization military? Idk states MI considered recovered died within 30 days. I'd consider solid data. money federal contractors redundant work (and probably fudge numbers), god forbid put money towards well crafted plan end actual problem.  data. Select peers, Europe North Maybe start serving inside hockey rink? They're pretty darn cold. space, harder leave, refrigerated. Makes sense - BHP mining company Australia sent home everyone 50, illness could badly affected Covid indigenous. months they're still home full pay.

We 4 active cases state still practice social distancing see masks about. hate right. came New York, told friends family would basically situation like Italy. concluded reading news. sad leaders access far greater resources basically let us every level. happen. hear this. doctor goes years medical school years experience top that. Anti-vaxxers spent hours reading blogs link back forth one another think ""I know doctors!"" Thank thoughtful comment. currying favor Trump anymore? average doctor US paid order magnitude french counterpart. dad qualified really gone elsewhere. example hospital system live. Even spring really enforcing travel restrictions. Exceptions state visiting elderly relative, picking food, grocery shopping, doctor visits, ""necessary"" home repair see people never really stopped going out. fucking stooge There's stories UK media well Vietnam looked him. :) Yep. Sits door while, garage absolutely need it. needed right away it’s opened, wash hands, open inner package, wash hands, remove contents. Boxes labeled date delivery. 

Groceries similar... delivery only, moved quarantine laundry room 3 4 days perishable. easily washed perishables, washed Castile soap putting fridge. Frozen refrigerated food gets repackaged outer package disposed of. open dump bowl, wife repacks. handle dirty, handles clean. wash one sink, move empty sink rinses puts away. Garden helps reduce need perishables store. 

Maybe overkill, it’s working far. Look I'm saying beat ass, but, yes I’ve heard private venues stadiums exempt actually, confirm? think restricting test typical sense enough test, close testing sites noon 2 due 104+ weather afternoon. Quick way injure/kill nurses/techs making work outside full gowns/gloves/etc. extended periods time extreme heat. restrictions coming reporting hospitals/clinics notoriously outdated fax results rather results updated realtime. suprised reporting lag 2 weeks+ major 3-day holiday weekend weeks ago. Friend got tested June 17th get result back June 29th (which actually hilarious seeing quarantine time) ""stricter stricter measures"", almost current recommendations set place already March. fact, stricter traveling looser people go holidays. watched woman pull mask hear cashier saying. eyes almost rolled head. People think freedom means can't whatever want regardless harms others, regardless private businesses require. It’s less 5 deaths. “Not included state’s COVID-19 death count approximately 3,000 cases person’s death certificate indicated symptoms similar COVID-19, it’s clear COVID-19 actually played role person’s death, Hutchison said.” Meanwhile 3,000+ possibly COVID counted. scales significantly tipped “undercounted” direction. That's opinion, rule law. Go birds 🦅 Yeah e already picked option 2 read yesterday, 11% wake students same. Still couple days signups close actually explicitly exception ‘1st amendment events’. allowed! Meanwhile, back reality...

Ohio State Rep. Candice Keller: ""Spent $53. mask. one store maskless. brave. Try it. like it."" probably die COVID-19 billion dollars know use it. get convalescent plasma something. people base entire identity contrarian, ""make point"" even point fucking retarded. I’m simple man.. see Brawndo, upvote sound like power bottom. want in. assume current total ICU beds bit higher 2019 total prep COVID, based last year’s numbers think you’ve got 

What I’d like know many empty beds super rural areas NC. Like know Charlotte Asheville filling up, assume Durham Raleigh same. mean cities capacity empty hospitals hours away? distribution extreme? Hopefully latter. There's none NJ. almost people said fuck it... We're herd immunity method whether like not. kinda board regardless want point.

Hide pops. Hide ya granny. Hide ya asthmatics... Cause murkin errbody Well, considering drove it... sure pretty intense strikes. see overly priced healthcare system that's extracting maximum value insurance pools without results.

And yeah, we'll blame rising costs healthcare uninsured obesity.

 long bankrupt families sporadically, else care. Seems like perfectly convoluted scam.

Finally pandemic happens see they're running house cards. 

No one go work, hurting healthcare workers. Ok, everyone hurt healthcare system?

Here's $1200. Good luck. own. fault plan paying rent without job. second. third.  Pay attention, patriot worried health nation looks like! true. Antibodies may disappear however immunity lost. Certainly within months. 

For example SARS MERS immunity lasted 7-11 years natural infection. broke leg needed surgery November. enough want go back. Nice hear! don’t believe “tell think make right thing” argument. leads low levels trust authority. CDC needs perceived factual unbiased. Anecdotes can’t unbiased. could give anecdote Denmark far better US 2-5 percent mask usage, doesn’t prove anything.

""I fake condition masks ouchy"" exception. I'd drag social media change it. Yes actually rented VHS movie called Forrest Gump starring guy named Ron Banks. inspired quit job go running full time. I'm actually typing perched near cactus sunny New Mexico. comment probably get lost, here’s two cents

I’m board certified pediatrician internist; conflicted opinions matter. pediatrician says get kids back school- psychosocial detriment deprived social interaction school likely untold effects many kids, educational standpoint surely long term deficits derive significant periods time spent outside classroom. Online learning slowly become functional teaching utility, teachers prepared trained give didactics solely elearning, given wide variety learning styles, confident many children suffer learning classroom. older teachers probably struggling hard technology anticipate lot early retirements. 

Honestly, I’m opinion, largest reason try get kids back school child abuse- hundreds thousands kids trapped home abusers; child abuse/neglect rise deaths child abuse. Teachers play pivotal role discovering, reporting, sheltering children abuse mandated reporters. see kids anyone, often first report. children stuck home laid off/furloughed parents/babysitters/guardians, also significant drop reported cases schools closed, means seeing severe critical injuries hospital abused kids. 5 children die child abuse per day US (before pandemic), number expected grow. that’s *deaths*- take note brain neglect, verbal abuse, injuries, sexual abuse, long term effects abuse (mental, social, physical) happening behind closed doors. suspect far greater number children die suffer effects abuse healthy children comorbidities die COVID reopen schools properly. course, would take great consideration sheltering immune suppressed children, chronic underling conditions, etc. would done **right.**

Now. said, internist says absolutely open fucking schools. taking consideration teachers, janitors, admin, bus drivers, etc- difficult protect working adults healthy children harboring virus vast majority cases totally asymptomatic barely symptomatic. risk adults much higher, young adult teachers conditions fine, going get unlucky. older teachers staff high risk, lot ancillary staff safe well. Likewise, infection risk parents, grandparents, guardians high- keep mind lot low income families (and many cultures general variety incomes) live grandparents utilize retired family members child care parents working. Likewise, lot children grandparents primary guardians removed parental homes (going back abuse issue). anticipate repercussions opening schools adults effect much larger magnitude expect, opinion near ready combat effects. 

I school administrator teacher; work university know graduate level, working tirelessly since January electronic lectures make schools safe learners return absolutely needed anticipating COVID may never go away. providing e learning adults much easier kids. haven’t heard much making elementary, middle, high schools safer kids; simply wearing mask isn’t going enough many age groups, adequately protect adults. needed large, decisive, timely regulated guidance governments get schools back open fall- August barreling towards us, states working hard botch even easiest steps containment. 0 confidence states adequately prepared open schools protect *everyone* (not kids), viewpoint cannot support reopening schools.  yet continue test people 50% little generous least Green Bay area. almost never see anyone wear mask get groceries.

33% freedoms 

1% ANARCHY!!!!! There’s way Broad St happens next spring, right? Hard justify going &lt;50 Late feb early May. 

For town-ers, Broad St refers Broad Street 10 mile run, race first weekend May ~40k participants heart city. postponed year fall outright cancelled decision today. mean, earlier complained enough early antibody tests performed Sweden, complained government actually using ones performed make policies early that. really cannot follow type reasoning (not calling logic, cause none). Man oh man 3 dozen fans going angry. Ah, someone can't work unsafe receive benefits keep fed.

Hmm, seem like teachers would starve either way. one would rather die. Dear literally country except North Korea: Please liberate us idiot half population. Soon yours: Texas Reality TV fan here, confirm Trump third-rate reality host. Top tier got people like Rupaul, Jeff Probst, Arisa Cox. got ones like job could improve like Julie Chen Phil Keoghan. Finally shit hosts like Trump. what? 

exactly said...i questioned over. 

why? 

i asked him, would logic that? O.o kept going around circles went onto different topics........ good cautionary tale, socially distanced successful, threw caution wind failed. Exactly. Feds don’t power that, states thought? good, thing irked little bit last Buy believes relevant statewide policies requiring masks appropriate public health response protecting frontline retail workers customers growing spread COVID-19.

I'm sure Best Buy, like everyone else, believes *national* policies requiring masks would even better, scared say so. Omg screw guy. love watching republicans fail pandemic one time would loved see get crap together. America isn’t failing people want fail it’s failing ignorance lack competent leadership. PERIOD. Many states going thru NYC went thru. Part building herd immunity. Cuomo hero. presided inevitable. Right speaking something dont proof of. didnt wear mask entire time get result whether said right away waited proof. say turns didnt look like fool people support asshat use play future accusations. ""Sure did. Remember everyone said refused wear mask plane"". Trump continues use tactic make (try) liberals seem untrustworthy get him.

EDIT: worship idiot politicians tell want hear. politician validates personal beliefs, assigns blame issues causing problems life tells going make everything better them. Selling snake oil Still nothing west part province, fear that's going change us soon. Yes, week updating paperwork. AFAIK Worldometers goes directly state county web sites gather data, imagine John Hopkins well. CDC always days behind didn’t even update weekends.

I’m sure fuckery planned need cooperation state county levels. Sad noises suspect Trump threatened withhold federal funds Polis play along. zero evidence back theory hold say compared funding threats Trump made. Right?

So easy bit distant, consume bit less, wear mask. think California almost inevitably going get hit hard point. It’s countries populous state governor heavy pressure start reopening. That, mixed millions people protesting certain areas reopening quickly, lead violent surge we’re seeing think America learn?

We'll vote someone dumber spite. Eagles stadium surrounded huge parking lot. chance letting fans anywhere near facility chance world pressure China paying damages? think fair pandemic started country, yet pandemic allows come ahead Western world. seems pretty random. know someone returned US day 10, nobody called checked-in them. vote republican. rich, average American could care less about. pepper spray someone coming knife may still advance. simple someone coming knife. political thing. FHM recommends therefore people don't.

FoHM recommend wearing masks. recommend wearing generally. Video said fight  Certainly JR show school without face shield? barely counted show up. taught kindergarten going work. They're kids , they're going understand risk. Bloody socialist healthcare provision.

/s Two thirds us will!! think also important parents family members serious discussions issue everyone around shares concerns. K. [The Oxford ""was found produce neutralizing antibodies 1.8 2.8 times greater seen recovered coronavirus patients."" 

Hopefully continues pan trials. Y'all inconveniencing life long daily basis whole laundry list shit people countries put with.

Free education, medical bills, three years paid parental leave, unions minimum 25 days paid vacation days things Americans get enjoy come mind think things would inconvenience much could never live longterm.

A piece cloth trap would LEAST irritations tbh. hard data back up- understanding material portions testing reporting infrastructure work weekends.

Thus see rush get stuff end week things lag weekend.

In case phenomenon present many countries whole pandemic. thus really need compare week week numbers like weekdays rather day day. lung transplant, virus attacks respiratory system.

*Claps cheeks* oh goodness! Who's thunk it!!!

You disingenuous. respiratory system system virus attacks. known.

You clamming systems impacted. Source. say tip hat mayor relentlessly fought federal government terms populair opinion. man asked ventilators ridiculed nitwits states trying provide best care city inhabitants. New York places way way ahead dealing pandemic one dense populated places earth. Good New Yorkers please remember government officials fought tooth nail get point! Damn that's bummer. 30 flights year bad experience yet aside delays control.

AA United underwhelm best.  mean public places? area mask use public legally required time universal, cases test positivity increasing anyways. problem likely ridiculous amount time people spend socializing homes friends family strangers could virus. Getting people wear masks peoples’ residences never going happen. Probably referring worldwide flu deaths per year cemented status one ~~hardest-hit~~ **dumbest** states US’s widening Covid-19 outbreak reporting record one-day increase coronavirus deaths, tallying 133 fatalities days saw country’s largest jump infections.

FIFY. He’s talking worldwide He's half man used be. Good riddance scumbag. Stabs someone refused service wearing mask, tries attack female police officer goes arrest him?? don’t kids used work sub. Thanks you’re doing! Stay safe.  bet. hate term “politicizing” normally, consider meaningless word. case data pass political appointees hands public allowed see it, instead CDC seems like good definition “politicizing”. 

It time look indicators like 2020 deaths compared previous 5 years. That’s weekend backlog... POS. Please. wasn’t even wearing right half time. nose. regardless, he’s 3 months late set good example.

Better late never guess Certainly government failed continues so, virus death sentence, sure. simple calculation, however, current cases deaths shows we're roughly 4%. We've increased testing bit - 5% recently.

Current stats show UAE 0.6% death rate they've tested nearly half population apparently. Even US ends 1% less death rate said done, that's huge loss life, herd immunity far reasonable option. let history decide egregious failure was. comparison county southern California we've 57 deaths total population 3.2 million.

They’ve adapted. every day it’s this:

So, I’ve wondering...so information rebuke anti maskers say...so I’m means anti masker I’ve thinking...

All this, followed two paragraphs bullshit trying downplay pandemic like entire Federal Government is...just little subtle...trying sow little doubt.

To 10% people posting “questions” actually serious, know MAGA maskers aren’t right hospitals dem damn librul cities aren’t falsifying death numbers cause panic...

America triggers LOT people. I’m amazed many people pure hatred country. 

I understand lot work America, don’t understand hating garden soul level. “22% intensive care unit beds still available statewide” mean actual numbers? Mask wearing definitely decreased weird. days go store 80% people wearing masks days might like 3 4 people besides me. 

One thing clear though: shutdown started cases rose, virtually everyone played rules. happens people almost certainly fall back line even they've started getting little lax. gun deaths! Yea sure heard immunity, however would still slow spread people practicing distancing % immunity exists. substantially reduces spread even before. gone restaurants started takeout sparingly I'm sure, tell mask usage works restaurant supposed eating drinking That's problem. Americans equate freedom comfort absolutely moronic. one reason keep border closed  Literally quoted death beds realizing they've fucked ROYALLY. quite sad takes getting point dawns we're trying fight virus damn hard. brought COVID-19 Syracuse, Rochester, Catskills?

Oh, see anyone said that. world seems fine, seems Americans stupid ones. risks ECMO astronomical. misinformation ""just another machine"" ridiculous. like saying nuclear war ""escalation"". need two ICU nurses RTs run machine fire-hoses unsafely anticoagulated blood communicating chest machine bedside (often) still ventilator, requiring insane medications blood clot machine outside body. time subject high-risk operator error could kill minutes, mechanical dislodgement literal life-support wake thrash bed, spontaneous bleeding, liters vascular constricting loosening medications streaming bloodstream manage blood pressure second second, almost certainty incredible PTSD.

The thing masks two issues need balanced. upside masks slow spread deadly virus. downside is...something...I guess. downside, materially. reason waffle masks cater political debate them, political debate frankly stupid.

I see Polis politician little courage situation. Colorado well, probably little him. He's lucky. think people told us COVID black plague 2.0 needed halt everything decided take month lockdown gather streets millions party...errr Mean protest  also load BS wearing masks prevents spread? Personally, I've problem wearing mask warranted, also willing give opposite viewpoint consideration. Medical science become joke due competing forces trying control narrative. Blocking instead getting naturally like avoiding doctor don’t get shots. problem’s still there, forgot true. Canada's well, can't take granted. still potential spiral control again. ! Please explain idea BUILDTHEWALL  completely incredulous: claim made absence evidence.

When cautious: minimal evidence support claim.

When persuaded: plenty corroborating evidence.

It's fake news probably fabricated definitely can't corroborated. news item something disagree with, make fake. specific values claim refined make fake. profit-motivated media organization exaggerating severity even fake news (but problematic exactly reason \[disaster-numbness\]).

Edit; corrected third link get eli5 this? I'm hella lost actually means. takes make people realize they've spent decades treating teachers underpaid babysitters, it. I'm scared still changed fixed. Teachers paras school staff among best brightest. treated paid funded such. could start pretending care whether live rest year not. know believe point. think that's purpose. fair valid point. went little information treat virus. Healthcare workers treating respiratory symptoms sudden people started dying blood clots &amp; issues. lack understanding new virus played huge part number deaths deal with. There’s much information even hot spot states, death totals may never reach levels know treat patients. My-err.

The participants followed two years receiving second dose.

A German study found 40% alongside social distancing methods. mask alone reduce 65% saying you’re saying masks pointless shouldn’t wear them, you’re saying beside point best dangerously misleading worst

Equally people think they're safe *because* they're wearing mask dangerously misleading. creates false sense security. You, anyone else going store normal mask, without, chance getting virus.

What offer level protection people infected person wearing one. still perfect, depending mask might still help - FFP ones vent bolter air leaving help. also needs tight fitting. also needs social distancing measures. mask alone work. That's seen huge differences US UK. US around 3 times mask usage, cases spiralling. UK next mask usage cases dropping. Theres credibility left.

Let's face it. They'll believe ANYTHING fox news, OANN, daily caller, 700 club conservative rag feeds conservative hystaria. lol, whole snopes article disingenuous. said risks weren’t bad. response every student infected x number would die. implied statement willing see x number students die without ever clarifying number was.

Snopes quietly fucking coronvirus shit entire time, it’s another example fact checkers good expertise given subject. Polis really pretty sensible far. first time he's said done something sounds pretty bad. I’d say yes, nobody live see it. result orange hair grumpy old man continuously consistently promotes fake drugs, covid hoax, wearing mask useless, economy fine, everything reopening.

Seekus Deathus Funny. see comment anywhere article.

But since put way. 99% survive 1% kicks bucket. (Yes even 1% high number. argument there.)

This article mortality rate. inflated numbers. forget mask. way many times I've seen border security American rolling border undeclared guns CBSA found them, go ""muh 2nd amendment rights!"" Gee, wonder masks work... dunno...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* r/Coronavirus[name want] similar things

for example biggest UK one r/coronavirusUK Ouch - even going reported cases they're tough go it. 67 139 48%. 139 contacted reported symptoms. Can't test people refuse. person you’re arguing really good points (u/LlebOcat9) you’re oblivious actually lead someone right direction.

Such ignorant stance, embarrassing  okay people wearing masks class room wearing masks? Even europe reopening schools. report that. Say “5% Covid patients show heart damage”

That’s whole point! Report correct information instead lying saying “half” problem well done steak? report last 2 paragraphs really want believe disease big deal Quite fitting talking Swedish country, especially since classifies intensive care Swedish country might classify non-Swedish one, frequently risks causing lot confusion countries classifications try report matter.

In short, nothing odd that. Fort Bend Florida... point gave oppertunity provide news articles worst flu years last decade could find article website discussing bird flu article fox news discussing history flu pandemics 1500-1800AD. willing reasonable discussion. Critical thinking important living fulfilling life. Take moment step back garbage propaganda pushed throat politics major news networks try make decision own. find sides table want fuck come conclusion start taking steps control life. said nation, people.  Minnesota makes list. really hoping removed next week. interesting article. Thanks sharing! murder rate way up! controlled spread. opening schools another way make worse. That's thing nobody's talking about. Cases skyrocketing schools closed. think can't get control, we're rolling toward daily mass gatherings schools. get it. protests started six weeks ago seeing massive spike NOW. Like, takes two weeks virus run course worst protests ended well June over.

I go ahead blame 4th July spike valid points less two weeks ago. Interesting. makes sense. susceptible people get infected first, HIT reached, less susceptible people get it, remaining susceptible reduced spread?

What's herd immunity threshold via infection something like regular flu?

Edit: Although says HIT different both, mentions body know difference vaccination normal infection R0 HITs roughly either population. company said chose face shield can't wear mask. one employee wearing faceshield. complainers switched masks pretty quickly. wonder he’s exempt he’s Canadian ? worry death lags 4th july weekend.. florida beating it. like miracle.  /s   know may happened gone get there.


Agreed, however, couple neighbors contact info site cameras view property.  know certain immediate neighbors watch property season inform things perfectly Basement could flooded would known.

Again, vast majority people second property exceedingly far primary residence lean rely upon neighbors check property then, couple I'm speaking do.

True need monitor check property, traveling Florida northern Ontario see basement leaked absurd. peak Nic Cage, fucking loved it! wonder that’s regional thing. maybe city vs urban? I’m small city ranchers laborers coming shop it’s opposite here. hear Dr Fauci asked see manager. trusted? often count associated deaths hurricanes - CO poisoning running generator inside, heart attack trying get fallen tree house, etc. - (just like covid19) without hurricane died right then. looks like article June 25th so, joke? Fuck cuomo bullshit stripping funding old folks homes policies. mention praising blackrock. Isn’t old study? feel like I’ve seen graphic before. You’re cool misleading titles confirms beliefs. 

The 10% figure high. know hospitalization rates 11% people 60, less 1% people 20s, general population infected people much lower.

You’re also ignoring questions study. important many people undiagnosed heart rhythm issues precovid.

Source: say ""WHAT FUCK?"" even believe we're pandemic now..... That's bad. anyone validate source. Unless it’s government academic research don’t believe think medical staff striking would change anything? aren’t paying attention- trump co don’t care dies. get medical help get sick, hell would give damn random patients hospital die? (Patients could otherwise saved btw, staff went strike) 

They blame democrats, base would buy would push on. furthest east state then? Hey hey hey, Colorado damnedest despite surrounded morons people TX FL plates driving try vacation/sight see discount good news order push pro-mask agenda?

There good news reason wear mask. really isn’t it? isn’t whether drug might good news, filtering news bolster pro-mask agenda. media obligation stop reporting promising new drugs order manipulate people wearing masks.

I wear mask. don’t go around pretending effective suppressing good news C-19, blowing bad news proportion order try get people side wearing masks. 

You mean people say virus politicized.  That's little confusing. biggest city continent new cases? rural Arizona them? definitely lot idiots want recall especially from

Inaction white house about. Oh boy, go again. Lol r/im14andthisisdeep load bullshit, thing health condition prevents wearing mask.

There is: autism, PTSD, SPD, claustrophobia mobility impairment prevents removing mask yourself. UK it’s $100 they’ve recently cancelled lot they’re getting upwards 40% false results. people says COVID party exists. yay! i’m cautious optimistic towards vaccine always get responses saying get hopes they’re produced quickly. good. I'm sure protests exempt well. Philly scheduled play tonight. DOOP! window opportunity closing.

On bright side, likes Graham feel comfortable breaking ranks right now, could spell disaster Trump come November. poorly written article. never mentions coverage order goes discuss mask usage UK whole. Can't really blame OP title one.

It looked seperate BBC news article actual able find correct details.

*edit I'm Southern California btw really idea what's going countries moment. much news going on. Sounds like maybe different ethnic Swedens vs. appear though may foreign born several latter category report abuse wearing masks: run away meth-pipe hitting train :(. None us know stop it, get (and would allowed go did?). We're half nation drunken driving neo-nazi enablers, half nation deer caught headlights. Given many times pattern played history, hold much hope avoid crash. much Republican. Maybe. thinking genetics susceptible getting sick die next decade damage time get infected drugs? tests data prove work. Notice countries full people wearing masks saw drop cases, US saw surge starting around april 1st, stupid states opened stuff back without requiring give opposite viewpoint consideration.

Lies viewpoint, ""opposite"". Lies invalid, side conversation. get deny obvious facts pretend lying. triggered post Reddit?

What wrong you?  say wasn’t real? believe it’s real concerned effective current strategies immunity lasts less 90 days. Wtf Doubt it. There's good chance internal plan hold tight long hopes remain open initial vaccine distribution.

Over next weeks, attendance likely increase well folks realize safety measures parks put place working well prevent spread virus. told well, employers (and worker unions too, regard safe working environment) evaluate activities increased risk measures would helpful. issue specific recommendations every profession. 

It still true advice mouth protection. That’s right. People refusing masks understand efficacy less absolute. 

They masks politicized. 

There amount efficacy data would change “minds”. True. also wondering saying otherwise might hurt accreditation. Luckily online options kids ability support home. make sense wear one underlying conditions?

what kind backward ass logic hearing? full it, American here, studied abroad Europe, barely work cram last week passed everything. I'd failed every one classes work ethic. works great giving someone “benefit doubt,” prevalent reddit.


Oh well, far im concerned seeing pretty predictable decade ago, US doesnt know manage serious crisis  cops typically older rioters. Additionally, rioters may asymptomatic infecting loved ones irresponsible manner. watch nightly unrest Portland every night streams. wearing masks cops. Coulda woulda shoulda. know actually changes belief told wrong? work you, topic? notion ""pro-vaxx"" moronic literally stooping level ignorance anti-vaxx. need empathetic intelligent people seek listen understand concerns hesitant vaccinations. need converse non-superior, non-judgmental way. anti-vaxxers certainly lost cause ignored. others wrongfully lumped category righteous pro-vaxxers serve purpose except keep drama going instead making actual effort help. No, enough die. teacher would feel go back work possibly die lose entire livelihood. US failing people, especially working class families. I’ve hunch since March case, still gotta ask, T-cells that? colleges online end September stay way get lifeline vaccine. prove everyone in-person school impossible ages. possible way make safe even 5000 cases per day nationally, let alone 50-70k+. Yes, sick idiots careless others, infected others stupidity surely caused many deaths already including themselves.

Again, good riddance. Yes, I'm sick staying home stupid many are. Every fucking country world getting better contained, are, getting worse worse. richest powerful country world. entitled assholes. Fuck may add. Vaccines aiming provide longer period immunity would naturally achieved surviving virus. No, we're not, that's actually problems coming since people traveling Florida particular coming spreading again. large two fold: places outside city could go went early stayed took shit seriously. Within friend group stretches like 25-35 never went unless necessities.

Small groups us would still meet every weeks go head New Jersey particular get essentials gone NYC due scalpers, intense system place spent time together frequently lockdown. Hand sanitizer every step way too, public transportation, cars. May Phase 2 hit since we'd started small 10 person group hangs apartments able see friends again. Essentially, going intermingling via public transport anywhere outside grocery stores, mitigated lot risk. quarantines taken every group meeting. group 0 us gotten sick.

It also helps large NYC lucky enough option work home, or, not, businesses closed people receiving unemployment. That's large biggest group people getting sick stuck jobs like security cooking cleaning usually held poorest live here. Infection spread due fact many people illegally, or, legally, still barely poverty line living small apartments 4-10 people. lot spread *wasn't* outside, virus ravaging overcrowded apartments one one time there's place proper quarantine 600 sqft place many others. Cuomo DeBlasio want speak though would address massive poverty housing issues NYC never do. Hazzah Cali.

Strike. attributed lack testing early phases pandemic, lack overall knowledge virus, overwhelming number patients icu high density population areas. feeling top 3 change upcoming weeks total covid deaths oh nahh got wrong there. 

I meant someone saying human species failing containing virus. really America. Yes people world feel effect wrong say human specie American. seen people wear masks? People don’t know work. I'd reckon actual covid death tolls would around asain Hong Kong flu levels. sad cause 2 flu strains much preventive measures we're taking right we've destroyed economy it. Texas education joke. funding actually gets (that siphoned board members' pockets) goes primarily sports programs academics. far curriculum goes matters standardized testing scores less determine much funding school receive (for football!) what's worse tie pittance toss teachers bonus students' scores incentive focus testing strategies aforementioned tests. thirteen years ago high school. cringe imagining curriculum now. That's insurance general. might need it, do, glad it. Pet insurance dirt cheap end even saved money instead, fraction cash 10k operation dog needs whereas paid insurance, already paid for. dumb behavior like pandemic prom Manchester dipshits Saline causing 43+ cases house party last week. part agreement gets reviewed every month extended extra month time. Strike anyway, make restoration jobs, certifications, retirement condition ending strike. Wow! Really threatening was. bet China scared two carrier groups SCS.

A man waving knife around threatening riddled full holes. Sure carrier groups powerful situation US US wave knife around. someone works office need least bachelors degree even apply, would surprised ignorant educated people be. keep close vaccine. keep extending?!? US recovering speak now. exactly propose that? You’d need strict lockdown worldwide. accurately, got earlier rest us. IDK look happened New York anything massive failure.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  insanity... one rooting it. us avid followers information coming able make rational educated predictions.

Edit: ok. Downvotes typical Americans. leg stand on. situation arrogance despite overwhelming ignorance. Republican 700 day lot less spring states lot higher testing capacity nowadays. practically dying already get tested early on, otherwise told stay home tough out. there’s lot places test anyone everyone, including without symptoms all. Maybe need start holding hosts events like accountable. Plus, hotel vendor. really hate idea criminalize non-compliance, Governor issues order shouldn’t ignored.  Nah actually care kids. wants privitized profit. irony masks mess facial recognition algorithms government chose crappy way identify mindless sheeple.

Side note: first time heard word sheeple back 90's. Neo-hippies using refer people office jobs. volunteers told behave exactly would normally behave. vaccinated whole group, one got infected, would know everyone avoided infection vaccine worked simply encounter virus. would scientifically rigorous evidence vaccine effective. Maybe unnecessary, far harmful.

Plus, don’t worry donning doffing every pit stop. /s hahaha forgot add CBD two stylists. Go collect data get back us. long time since story broke. happened mid May. must something anecdote support conclusion masks suppress spread C-19 community settings now. TBF flu shot might right - went around second grader's class last winter, mostly test-confirmed cases, third (including kid) felt little fever day half. Others mild, course. Get flu shots, people, might keep getting flu it'll sure make getting less awful! 

(I know students, might people call GI bug food poisoning mild headcold flu. But, flu shot, actual flu really mild too.) one suggesting people breathing particles kicked surfaces. separate scenarios:

A) Touch surface touch face

B) Someone talking, breathing, coughing, sneezing around live Sweden it’s dirty word. want wear one go ahead one complain. don’t want wear one it’s also ok. one complain. blows mind well known KNOW you’re going start fire something simple. 

Why leadership like this. It’s really depressing. late close, early open;

Problem way early close. shutdown month ago, think people would receptive us closing March less 1000 total cases. cases, one took lock-down serious (evident minimal decrease daily case # - ). Couple people fleeing northeast/northwest hotspots Florida, CA, TX AZ things started looking grim there, recipe disaster states. Ya sure, opening accelerated downfall thing least Texas, even indefinite lockdown probably done enough. honestly goes mid 2021 everyone going need new jobs really work well '08. said, recession we're currently facing less worse one Bush left us with, dug one. mean.. except fact still breed everyone except French, pretty much species.

Homo Americana-Federalascus

The Dodo birds human race. Known prefrence white feathers, tenacity stubborn ass iron will. Proud home territory, fed Greedcredicus Cricket, found abundance throughout territory. frightened, show incredible defiance, often exact opposite would expected Homo Sapien cousins. call Homo Americana-Federalascus also unique. communicate common english, show preference call ""FREEDUMBS!"" attempting de-esculate confrontational situation. almost sounds like made playing politics everyone's lives Florida reports 100% people tested positive NYC zero cases one day. anyone buys bullshit deserve whats coming way.  Lets hope false allama. everyone sub is. Glad live Europe rather US though. bad asthma. severe allergies block sinuses. wear mask whenever go building isn’t house. doesn’t bother all. think people use reasons full crap making excuses they’re selfish. cause govr ran election People writing headlines ""Eighth Highest Day"" now? 

Coming soon - Highest Daily July 14th Case Count Since Pandemic Began!!! find reliable daily deaths strictly due Covid data?  deaths going well now, depressing gets.  Imagine voting him. 
Now imagine ones vote again. Trump retweeted Chuck Woolery’s craziness, may want walk ‘taking seriously’ statement back... provide scientific studies show cloth mask scarf effective preventing spread virus? know type.. unfortunately. Hopefully sleep well knowing sort ultimate judgement, good person. !Remind 30 days mean, everyone stopped reading upvoting articles, news would stop writing shit. Upvote compliance safety instead idiots.

...was literally point.

What suggested align reality either media standpoint human behavior standpoint.

My click upvote changes nothing. people huddle solos stick heads sand whatever they’re going do. Media going report whether gets five clicks 5,000.

And frankly, don’t want head-in-the-sand silo huddler shielding reality. It’s important know people exist, try understand believe believe, inform children heads swivels. people may reinforced observations Trump company. average active GOP supporter much That’s right, meant western Middle class vacations. That’s real problem here. voting Yes, underwear required...for next 3-6 months treat masks like underwear see happens. Huh? 

A permanent lockdown? ""semi-permanent lockdown"" even mean? Really? Source? distinction is? Wave 2 different strain? wave 2 considered nightmare one viruses usually become less deadly mutate? Seriously. Public shaming thing work. actually tiny bit hopeful right might increase uptake public transport well — U.K. government vague potential benefits face coverings point I’m enormously surprised people currently don’t think matters wear not. interesting see messaging clearer they’re planning recommend widely, really hope is. shut absolutely everything down, over, later explosion. Every person currently runs course within two three weeks, peters stops spreading. course, good luck enforcing kind lock way many Americans acting right now. using really small sample size stopped two gas stations way camping trip back. time saw zero masks. people working people shopping. 

I’m glad hear it’s actually lot better experienced. Fun fact, cloth materials vary widely also tremendous variations way construct mask, effort takes breathe better works. you’ve ever worn N95 mask eight hours working know mean.

Larry affect, you’re looking filtration want make certain air circumventing filter. need good snug fit feels like you’re using amount effort hold snug mouth, might circumvention.

In industrial hygiene, pressure drop often used surrogate measure well filter working. there’s little pressure drop, there’s little energy lost filter, usually indicates there’s leak air circumventing filter.

The idea cloth masks really filter it’s cough/sneeze guard. However, want mask provide limited protection filter, effort takes breathe better - obvious caveat want able breathe somewhat normally, won’t subconsciously liable remove it. mask effective without continuous compliance. People need need guess. regardless large gatherings pandemic good idea makes little sense state many dense many dense areas. live East see 20 people time, fine, issue dense areas won’t unless state makes them. comments Mesa county example. Sigh. gov. California (I think) yesterday Twitter telling Australians imprisoned fight government (some back lockdown spread everywhere). focusing us 6500 cases day? Theres part problem. Ironically ok imprisoned world looking US going fuuuuuck desperately trying get trouble. That’s wife does. She’s healthcare worker community. N95 cloth mask top.  people “it’ll never happen me” belief. protect something can’t happen them? minds we’re inconveniencing “our” pandemic.

these people think “i don’t need use condom. i’ll never catch anything. happens *other* people.” 

they never change unless thing could never happen finally happens. smh Hong Kong seemed control... they’re 3rd wave cases rise. It’s gonna get real bad US don’t vaccine ready. Question mods: post others posted legit sources Twitter deleted immediately? starting shut back would respect huh Each?  flip would nothing short monumental. still get started going barefoot grocery stores buying house moving middle nowhere, worried breaking lease? also rely taking money liberal states republicsns love shit would high risk environment? places tests antibodies different places test active infection need least 2 weeks healthy take tests. taken people professionals working task (not taking care patients something). antibody tests requiring bit blood - self-testing kits mailed earlier country selected houses. specific appointment time exactly avoid congestion waiting crowded rooms. several regions literally pharmacies performing tests.

Not least, motivation go test antibodies positive, means go see parents grandparents without worrying infect them. read somewhere tweaked strategy slightly older people nursing homes protected. deaths came people nursing homes. Sure, testing capacity probably stabilize around 12000 cases day can’t think horror fiction writer created plot massive viral outbreak occurring US government’s response “yep, aren’t going anything keep schools open. Wait - ok, 50% capacity restaurants. it.” Western parents, live there, call Governor DeSenseless, I’m steering toward Governor DeathSentence. seems reflect times accurately. Stay healthy, people! Honestly, one reasons taken table may speed trials all.

So, deliberately exposing people without payoff. wow... That's voted him. Go get 'em, Polis. started translating gave up. Zhang Wenhong something say goddamn, always repeat things twice waffle pissing off.

Here's first 4 paragraphs:

**Zhang Wenhong:** Imported cases closed management, every imported case closely monitored managed. Thus effect discount calculation discussing pandemic China. still go work everyday, including daily visit patient wards. Currently 400 imported cases, Shanghai effectively operating cases. Thus imported cases, current management China effectively zero. That's closed management mean: total separation society large. Never mind 400 cases, even worried Shanghai 4,000 imported cases.

At stage people focus therapeutics. course too, involved clinical trials. 400 cases Shanghai, despite effective therapeutics far achieved zero fatality. Likewise 300 plus cases Beijing, also fatality. Considering cases closed management effectively disregard imported cases calculation say China active cases. active cases, what's next? strongly agree Dr Zeng Guang's opinion policy eradication necessary, yet hand complete eradication nation wide remains impossible short term. tell now, Beijing definitely zero. policy eradication come time zero. first two cases popped Beijing made call huge issue. Many people said rush judgement, yet month later Beijing outbreak resolved. confident? Wuhan achieved eradication. Dr Zeng Guang said China's eradication policy actually bargain, countries aiming bargain? cannot achieve eradication, eradication requires great determination.

Let's say China US terms testing. full population test Wuhan would say China's testing capability inferior US. question weather test entire population Wuhan discussed quite while. certain US could run tests us, yet noticed, despite enormous amount test US conduction able successfully control outbreak. words, normal conditions tests helps controlling spread, yet work US.

So difference. suggest due system government. can't speak that. seated today room full scientists speak scientific angle. think main difference China US community management ability. specifically ability go household test eradicate. Fact matters can't it. test isolate cases test ineffective. mathematical models put big emphasis test efficiency. seeing never case like us anyone able achieve near 100% test effectiveness seen Wuhan Beijing. Wuhan truly achieved eradication. know cities provinces dealing Wuhan, far Shanghai concerned completely open Wuhan Beijing. long hold green health QR code care came from, welcome open arms. believe test result. Appreciate you’ve done, honestly can’t even imagine you’ve seen through. it’s infuriating leadership end day it’s control. Keep good fight, thousands others like can’t thank enough This! held liable deaths, illnesses, disabilities. Literally he’s worse nothing, policies helping spread. r/NoShitSherlock Understandable hope things work you. would surprised made comment check twitter Amazing, legend EU become today? envision ideal EU? honestly im kind work indoors retail, id shitting pants...so keep bravery. said karen found selling bottle waters .......... without permit. Uh, what? husband's grandpa born Canada. I'll look this. assumption I’m using excuse take seriously mistake. I’m big fan accuracy. 0.5% bajillion infections still way many deaths.

The CDC currently classifies 0.5. Covid-19-projections. San Antonio pretty poorly right now. People around testing positive. wondering stupid nutsack going spread despite best efforts stay fuck away. going see end month unemployment extension signed. 

It's going real shitshow. That’s top 25 school entire world. must amazing options. Learn like Americans best lesson right now.  AB BC(maybe another province 2?) stopped reporting weekends, days worth cases bump monday numbers lower weekend numbers. kind bullshit college going charges parking nobody going there? November already??? actually particularly deadly strain. 2017-2018 flu killed ~62,000 Move Canada 

People reason think moving another country easy walking cross border declaring citizen. 

Getting visa live another country, *especially* coming America, *very difficult* since forever, coronavirus not. Based [on data surrounding Americans vast majority Americans would put hardship *just spending money application fees*, nevermind actually getting selected granted visa.

That's factor costs associated. Moving place National Healthcare? Tough luck, paying taxes *and* private insurance initial months least. also moving entire life, securing new home, new job, saying goodbye everyone know, learning new laws, new languages, new customs, etc. married, convincing spouse come too, things well. children, thing. Many us also take care parents grandparents siblings.

""Just move"" ever easy choice lot Americans -- again, probably majority -- next impossible. Trump can’t shut single county can’t open single school. president authority - beef state local officials do. learn love metric (everything divisible 10 - expect home stuff, that's still feet reason) Yes, FDA would approve it. mean someone go rogue recommend though. Someone bully-pulpit. see you’ve got totally figured based comments I’ve posted Reddit. means I’m mute real life. someone possibly interact Reddit still pro-active, vote try good influence people? villains one place. west way strict...there never dangeous vaccines anti vax fearmongaring... die, get worse fall, aftermath, we’ll pile bodies sky high. Given can’t read statement, I’m
inclined disagree say go college Florida coming hot today 15,000 cases.

Today's presser Governor great. asshole idea hell going on. blow in? never heard I’m going google it. it’s another rich prick “ideas” thanks. BBB government entity, many government entities recommend using them. non-profit organization serves mediator issue business. incredibly knowledgeable great do. 

Another option simply fight charges disputing transactions bank. business charge money legally cannot use services. Anybody sees comment, read piece work's post history. decide worth even five seconds time consideration. Shit luck. Hardwired self destruct. Past tense versus present tense. Medical science learned areas significantly improved treatment.

If used medical approaches today NY Italy, would probably 1% higher. don’t. 

We know invasive ventilation broadly used. know using statins steroids fight lung inflammation significantly reduces deaths. much clearer idea antivirals effective. much convalescent plasma use treatment.

You can’t ignore ways chopped death rate since March information wasn’t hidden, wasn’t headline. people read whole article... happy neighbor province, wish could get point hot spots keep popping people getting complacent.

CFL season Winnipeg hub?! I’m VA, amount parents school board meeting pushing kids go back full time CRAZY. 

Teachers Bus drivers spoke like “Full time happen. CANT it.”, meanwhile parents like “Fuck it, send back. Take chance.”

What’s going happen kid catch it. teacher. another kid. Nobody quarantine except teacher, it’ll spiral there. K test cases. amount seeing goes well beyond seeing increased testing.  Thank US Military helping pandemic. hospitals need help get thing. Miwuhan beach. Enjoy stay.....in hospital. Monday, all-Republican Texas Supreme Court dismissed appeal party seeking host convention scheduled 7-1 ruling. 

I genuinely expecting Texas Supreme Court let go ahead it.

The Texas Republican governor issues mask order.

The Texas Republican Supreme Court backs Democratic mayor's decision cancel convention.

Texas actually showing sense.

In meantime, I'm stuck Florida. Yeah, think important keep news. people literally think risk younger patients. Two weeks ago two 2 year olds, 12 year old think 16 18 year old died. one single week. Four young people. Lol idea talking about. 

You probably can't even explain view morals warped. Exactly long lasting stuff virus body still discovering Shame work common sense, logic science don't. braindead consumed Fox, OANN, Trump bubble go anywhere near latter three. Shame work. unfortunate, choice short fines punishment? make pariahs, less want keep willful ignorance. Orange County idiots refuse wear masks cause da freedum Here's comparison you:

Exactly, U.S. idiots protesting wearing masks Trump came get go said ""wear mask, best option. help us stop spread covid 19"" idiot VP always wearing masks TV every time, every speech. 

If Trump this, would A) far less cases US, B) far less people protesting C) talking point could brag about, except 1 minor thing did, blocking travel CHYNA! March. beat drum every time someone accuses Trump anything.

I wonder mean ""collectivist"" applies Germans? I'm familiar term.  evidence major factor. certainly seemed though could be, many articles reported (this representative article Time magazine, pretty center road publication), simply weren't. 'why' interesting, hopefully guide activities fluid period evolving knowledge. Well hello neighbor! Again, March travel restrictions placed unnecessary travel abroad also recommendations unnecessary travel within country farther 2 hours travel time. lifted June.

Please, provide one example ""stricter stricter"" far everything saying wrong even admitting it. think it'll take decades studies analysis post-mortem this. still studying long term effects dust inhalation 9/11. foresee tsunami academic papers, theses, reports coming next 10-20 years Don’t get people wearing improperly?  Lulz. Same. Osterholm hopeful, during/after Musk, ugh. believe 180. Winter coming.... employer requires doctor’s note can’t wear mask.  That's article says...they given one wear instead face mask. Nowhere say mandated, except students cannot wear cloth face coverings reason. sorry hills make last stand, right wear mask surely must sorriest. home depot, Lowes, applebees, target, wal mart, favorites freedumb fighters follow suit? Vaccinating every person honestly trivial cost compared spent. Lets say £5 make £5 distribute administer. That's £70 billion. global scale that's almost rounding error compared what's already spent globally  mean case stricter gun restrictions, seems backwards me?

Edit: Oh understand now. Needed downvotes level reading comprehension. misread meaning type person would state present case stricter restrictions, rather person justifies them. thing California. northern part, even conservative parts, much better southern parts. Historically herd immunity achieved use vaccines we're Reddit, friend. ""None us lie"" blatant lie evidenced shear insane level medicare fraud prescription narcotic pain meds doctors country. Michigan sent 18 physicians prison last year alone. lie. fact, lie lawyers literally teach lie. Public education joke throughout country. told great grandparents exist gosh tragic story around. would consider second test. relatively high false negative rate, especially symptoms appear. symptoms consistent covid fever, would say better safe sorry case.

Edit - can't type expect everyone wear mask run bike. really bad. God, pic guy mouth open directed towards guards something. I’m Albuquerque. hope current increase due rule changes early June (particularly allowing dine-in) we’ll start seeing things level next week due rollback last week. Even best case though, don’t think get back statewide late August (and later cities). too!!! Here's tomorrow! seen many people bring riots protests big reason current surge. catch zodiac murders might get They'll people die heat stroke instead covid lol Would love know precautions put place, namely mask wearing [this trending Expect stories like this, publication notes memes circulating social media among online gun groups claiming state open- concealed-carry laws firearm owners require anyone carrying firearm wear mask, laws exist, federally Kansas. 
 
But...but...but meme TwitBook told carried gun, wear mask! MUST true!  cool. love Malaysia. Hi New Zealand Dr. Redfield national television he's even wearing mask.

Hey Dr. Redfield... put mask on, TV! go random store shops test people

-Republicans, probably  problem lines thinking completely divorce virus problem economic problem *can't* actually practice. freewheeling pandemic going obvious human economic consequences whole healthcare system, also going broad economic consequences people see what's happening. 

We saw NY, based phone data: People locking down, great degree, ever told to. family/friends -- we're right now. There's shutdown order live, need be. see risk, respond going eat, shopping groceries, etc. on. know anyone planning go back ""normal"" there's vaccine reliable treatment.

In words, relegating one problem focus solves neither amplifies both. Deaths lag new cases think already undone making non-story, can't read article due paywall. Mind reading updating? I'm wrong corrected. reminder show Arrested Development takes place... parents (in Greenville) invited take kids gathering neighborhood week. *They'll icecream trucks!*

No, mom...just. no.

My aunt literally released hospital covid (so sick) still think anything dangerous flu.

I know what's people here. Man, kudos Governor keeping state safe. would bet faced lot heat antimaskers, Republican state legislators, President himself. Hope keeps up. Makes sense. someone think problem testing reporting. weird coincidence whenever Canadians lake water reminded beer reason test again? Long Island going lead way second wave (Nassau Suffolk counties). Even went through, plenty construction workers refusing wear masks flying Trump flags. Teens nighttime beach parties tons adults house parties. can’t wait figure sabotaging children’s school year. People like actually look numbers - notice always look raw case count instead percentages population adjusted numbers. lot easier make things say ""US bad!"" guy trying. Imagine could country working towards goal. ""Based findings, researchers concluded 0.7% everyone infected virus New York City died due Covid-19.""


TF? Based people acting would guessed low. place image looks familiar. anyone know is?  preaching! Best thing happen retail! can't much mystery, people experience longer incubation periods 14 days 1-5% cases. 1 1000 chance original patient long incubation, following cases showed beyond 28 day mark. Unusual impossible. Never said thought practically feasible. we'll get nowhere paralyzed apathy. That's culture here. one reasons trying reform police. It’s walking back student visas this. Ex restaurant worker here. Never myself, saw several occasions. must come contact someone ill. careful go places need (work grocery store) wear masks time. work home wife works OneBlood (local blood donation business). 

Anyhow, Sunday around 3 pm, started develop fever. pool beers felt like something went me. became fatigued weak. went inside check temp 101.8. Well, figure Florida sun, assumed may overheated.

I wait 20 minutes go down. decided lock self away rest. couple shivering hours later, 102.3. took Tylenol called call nurse recommended get COVID test fever, chills/shivering, body aches diarrhea. 

Sunday night Monday morning hell, toppin 103 degrees lot rest, fever, diarrhea, well. thing last night today, except fever got 103.5.

**TL;DR**

I COVID test back tomorrow. wondering anyone heard COVID cases fever, chills/shivering (that actually kicking type) stomach cramps diarrhea, sore throat, chest pains shortness breath? expect respiratory symptoms? early respiratory symptoms appear fever?

Like wrote above, going since Sunday afternoon.

Thank advance help responses. someone freaking bit, really appreciate it.  1) People experience permanent organ sensory damage. isn’t death, it’s still important.

2) New cases increases likelihood virus spread even faster, inundating hospitals.

So yes, wrong.  They're trained shoot. Even old lady knitting needles would get shot needles deadly weapon. universities already cancelled fall sports?  Ivy League one.  Others too: see rioting took place NY past couple months? city leaders scared witless impending lost tax revenue people fleeing violence coming back  fucking flight...wtf Yea keep hearing people talk one wearing masks can’t relate. I’m Bucks County seen maybe 10 people wearing masks businesses since March really enjoy Lovecraft CGI netflix preview really threw off, saying worth it? couple weeks go pass estimated bad flu season. Albeit 4 1/2 months instead 6, unlike flu season go away. NYPD looking way right now. still illegal drink alcohol public areas, NYPD enforcing all.

For example, outdoor dining allowed, restaurants allowed sell to-go alcohol. resulted places lots people around drinking outside. NYPD enforcing social distancing, open containers. fact, weekend reported something like 100 social distancing violations 5 open container violations. could easily written 50,000 open container violations weekend, looked way.

So, better way would say drinking public de-facto decriminalized, rather legalized. lost GDP per person dies

Is loss GDP downside person dying?

Are even prepared add tiny, small percentage top represent human misery fact people would quite like die? 18 March, Health Agency recommended everyone avoid travelling within country. eased May allow 2 hours travel. removed June. 

Again, stricter stricter. saw someone make princess costume. style hey help kids I'm it. trump get lessons Xi :. Kill info. really impressed setup. love shit BB, needed. easy shopping trip. price online, shipping times wildly inaccurate right now.

It looked like lot people using curbside. realize it’s simple, yes? There’s shit choices area jobs 17 year olds. She’s taking college courses nursing degree already, options field live nursing homes, *at least* frightening restaurant, I’d say even so. yeah, please go on.. hit earlier states. E- Either way, Ro pretty damn low gives immunity makes less severe next time. This...sadly tho seen Lyfts pick people w suitcases passengers maskless. 0.01% children die Covid still thousands children, unacceptable.

I support sacrificing lives economy return ""normal"". I’m curious too. Man curbside pickup BEST!! don’t even get car. hell people want hang store even non pandemic times beyond me. Don’t better things do? “however small country’s GDP” unnecessary qualifier.  fool proof, access soap water, second best option there.

It would illegal every state business serve food without access soap water. establishment eat operating legally, wash hands.

I'm sorry, get complaint, really pointless. wash hands eat place buying food pandemic soap water accessible, eat there. keep ranting showing triggered

Actually seems like triggered. OP simple list quotes sent time vote No-Bama ""020 !

Obama running. We're aware lied. admitted it.

No - made hard choice preserve ppe needed like good leader should. change guidance world filled people like yourself

On side note. I've noticed keep deleting comments here. Perhaps think respond suffer embarrassment need delete comment future. oath nothing words person behind actually believe care it. talk schooling debt many doctors solely money, making lot it. act like prescription pill phase fad relegated doctors. Finally! cure found! /s zombie apocalypse nightmare world we’re in? know think single worse thing privatize infectious disease planning. 

Seriously, profit? one employee, blow 100% federal funding hookers blow, another 20 years next potential pandemic hits, declare bankruptcy? hard establish crew infected, considering 35 days, contact dry land supplies brought port Ushuaia,” said Alejandra Alfaro, director primary health care Tierra del Fuego.

Do mean took supplies left? stopped port get supplies. latter, I'd wager money that's caught it. took supplies them, possible strict quarantine voyage claimed, caught hotel boat. beds beds, level care required patient makes ICU ""beds"" different normal beds. hospitals separate units staffing patients considered critical care patients, patients need intensive monitoring care order stay alive. staff units specifically trained monitor care patients state. units also likely kind equipment required help patients. increase staff equipment makes unit special. political Republican made virus wedge issue? Walk off, nothing important here. Never claimed US military weak. probably overcautious.

But let bit overcautious? tough times, especially risk, harm wait extra hour checking out.

When little control, sometimes helps cope trying control things *can* control, waiting longer going there. 30-year-old guy died 2 days ago saying hoax contracting ""covid party"".  Italy Spain too. lot states refer model hard hitting ones cant something like South Korea. plenty warnings lot Asian countries heeded it, also probably common sense mask vital survival sense community rather obedient. referencing tourists meant states - visiting NYC (where live). foreigners...who shit control MUCH better have. first time comment topic...

I personally hate whole buracracy related vaccines created partial response vaxphobes... empty home, allow homeless person stay rent? generous. Heck, could start small, /u/drydenmanwu suggested, let one crash couch.

---

While agree sentiment, idea *let homeless live vacant homes* naive. misunderstand me, think need massive overhaul social services, better access physical mental healthcare, expanded housing support programs (up including fully provided home necessary - nice, think college dorm), etc. hate sentiment ""we could solve homelessness just... took vacant homes gave homeless!""

We need something homeless problem. condemnation homes homeless helps one, issue supply, even one wealth inequality. homeless homeless housing prices inflated, they're homeless myriad reasons usually boiling mental illness addiction. failure social safety nets US. ❤️ study. lazily crafted hypothesis significant assumptions.  understand people comply mask wearing go stores, stores discretion serve you. like ya go beach town, signs read shoes shirt service. i'm go speedo make political fiasco something control over. ...It's spinoff quote Fight Club guys... Random acts awesomeness like make day. Good you! don’t respond logic reason , need convince emotional level (that’s way get anti vax sister even CONSIDER she’s wrong ) reminder NY NJ combined 47k deaths.


Texas, Florida, Arizona, California 16k total


How made local handling two states?


Complete shut really saved them. Ah yes, Philadelphia learned history. 

***Now*** that’s employ facts benefit humanity. 

Gee, we’re *what else* could learn thing called history? True facts true hopefully doesn’t come back NY... seems fair enough. 181 person/sq. mi

Trust people interested spreading north Manitoba. main city (Winnipeg) located south province population slightly larger Stockton, California, comparative purposes.  provincial premiers? No, really. elected representatives - said, official Opposition. 

The Alberta premier? Test again. suspect exposure, try test least twice. workplaces require least 2 negative tests confirmed exposure/positive test come back. would test twice within short period time , I'd test 2 negative tests week later sure. craziest realization discovering unhealthy behaviors *profitable*. victims, industry leaders. know blame single person, many systems encourage addictive behaviors. Anxiety causes people buy. Instagram causes anxiety perfect, competition pressure workforce causes people seek escape solutions. Keeping Jones's causes us buy houses can't afford become indebted banking sharks. happened community growth development? I've never felt Isolated. feels like everyone talk minds bought paid corporate interests. I'm terrified there's escape this. picture passed around days, others right thing? Again, it’s possible someone infected, it’s statistical analysis used figure many people infected asymptomatic. don’t test *everyone*, test group extrapolate data group. tested 1000 people California found single person didn’t symptoms antibodies, wouldn’t conclude 40% cases asymptomatic. tested 30% clients barber shop none tested positive. make reasonable deductions data. Deaths lag new cases Meanwhile Alberta government trying cut pay would hospitals go bankrupt midst overwhelmed patients.
They work max capacity close everyone else.

It’s insurance companies going take hit. travel work deemed essential travel. Protests allowed. Eagles think lol think important *everyone* hears it, even though many us surprised. Yep. Way go, FDR. laws beat NY 100% apply AL WY. Duh really.

Ideally change rate growth particular cluster would best measurement country terms fighting virus. 

If 2 countries dozen initial cases cluster able stop spread virus early wouldn’t say country bigger population dealt better per capita. Well least pops daily say things awful getting worse nothing else help value. less deadly, better knowledge medicine treat this. know getting hospitalization numbers roof many states right now. deaths unfortunately come, takes time. doesn’t change fact 71k new cases. look odds numbers. 99% people 14 day incubation period, that's quite reasonable. Yes going miss 1%, far extend it? 99.9% 21 days? 99.99% 28 days? There's diminishing returns. This, could asymptomatic. Still it’s encouraging... people say lung conditions American Lung Associations says: 
   Masks Cause Low Oxygen Levels?  
   not. wear masks day long hospital. masks designed breathed evidence low oxygen levels occur. evidence, however, prolonged use N-95 masks patients preexisting lung disease could cause build-up carbon dioxide levels body. People preexisting lung problems discuss mask wearing concerns health care providers. absolutely scientific evidence mask wearing physical distancing weakens immune system.  
  
My Aunt rare lung condition (like super bad asthma) Grandmother COPD. wear cloth masks. wonder could backfire. allow say 25% capacity strict mask rules, think problem. blocking fans may unintended consequences large amount fans gathering outside stadium places. Places mask usage social distancing enforced. would say maybe 5% people public transportation system wear masks. [...] low, it’s zero. 

I think forgot /s. hope forgot /s. ICU requires Lower patient ratio due higher acuity patients. ICU nurses 1 nurse 1-2 patients. ICU patients critical drips, vents devices require higher level care trained staff

A regular bed higher patio ratio patients lower acuity. regular beds general medical floors staffed 1 nurse 5-6 patients. nurses general medical floors knowledge anything ICU related. typically cannot push cardiac meds manage drip heparin. argument hospitals convert regular beds icu beds insane me. People think nurses wear many hats, still requires training. can’t train general medical nurse ICU nurse less hour.sure make bed ICU bed can’t make nurse ICU nurse. takes training time I’ve read plasma full antibodies, itll protect months probably. However, us healthcare system controlled big Pharma... also limited supply possibly expensive. Best option though. Idk... ""I like Trump"" sounds like he's trying lose business conservative state. He's acting like ardent supporter that's sure. 

Regardless think handling corona situation pushing non hardcore supporters out. ❤️ ofc every american sucks feel really bad every single one y’all wears mask wants asap Ted Cruz's beard weird?

Good thing murders contagious means precious economy tanks near November. General strike. can't fire entire workforce kidding can’t pay hotels employees need paid PA count? kids going Private schools proper set ups like. God people ghouls. agree saying. Obviously, intelligent people understand predicament wearing masks. However, gave conspiracy theorists deniers something hang to. Bottom line, terrible decision nation's premier medical authority lie public. three months come better solution i'm sure I'd call impossible situtation. could instructed public wear fabric mask save non fabric medical community. Agreed, yet predict 8 weeks ;

We national mask mandate

Texas still dragging feet ""shutdown""

Florida US epicenter Covid cases per capita (probably surpassed Brazil India Total cases)

T-man say Fauci's fault providing better guidance

The rest world stopped laughing us watch us like train wreck fascination disbelief even could dense. Fauci honor used tissue orangetan... work organic synthesis lab. wear goddamn faceshield 6+ hours day everyday, want project all. lunacy. straight pointless even get tested waiting day.  New Mexican, also ashamed. We've required masks 2 months, people assholes. Examples:

- rational, reasonable friend told one day stopped wearing mask saw bunch people without assumed public order requiring longer effect. 

- relative works health care industry another state came visit. Flat refused 14 day quarantine ""it's pointless"" want constantly removes mis-wears mask public uncomfortable fogs glasses.

Plus strangers see wearing mis-wearing social distancing. people truly heartless assholes hope able learn appreciate concepts science compassion without lose someone love.

In NM, we've recently rolled back reopening dine-in longer allowed (was allowed weeks cases going down). People bitching governor fault assholes violating order spreading virus.

I ashamed us, local national scale.

Fucked up.The crown appealing so, continued... Negative travel restrictions. States say restricted, short breaking national guard check point everything crosses state lines shutting highways there's nothing substance.

Lockdown refers closing schools/businesses/recreation places give people reason about, likely implemented curfew Vietnam defeated US, rubbing faces /s . “once” great superpower can’t even produce wear masks could texas, places, ban public employees striking..

That’s fucked up. Hard fight stupid Blame al-al-alcohol ♫ 0.8% worlds population fifth cases worldwide beyond insane. would kind understand third world country, not. I'm lost words stupid moronic people really be. Ok, owner pay mortgage bank perhaps living tenants rent, person blame can't afford subsidize renter that's work?

That seems insane. fault renter owner plan country's healthcare system woefully ill prepared pandemic.

Our government could easily put moratorium mortgages extending life mortgage however many months takes get safely back work. 

That's largest expense anyone. Instead...we block work nearly half country, give em $1k, say good luck own. 

And despite that...we world's hot spot. Like Wtf?!?

We global embarrassment. Circulating antibodies necessary immunity. whole point cell study. cells remain reactive SARS-CoV-2 proteins spur body's immune system mount defense new infections--i.e. confer immunity. 

Infection SARS-1 MERS, two dangerous human coronaviruses, follows pattern: serum antibodies fade time, cells remain reactive. date cases reinfection SARS-1 MERS suggests infection confers long term immunity. 

Also interesting researchers found reactive cells half blood samples tested 2015 2018 meaning must circulating coronavirus whose proteins similar enough SARS-2 many people might pre-existing, cell-mediated, (at least) partial immunity. might explain groups (e.g. children) seem get infected less, suffer fewer symptoms, survive better others. lot fat young people probably lot it. told ingesting disinfectants would help talk thots dog.  That's meant herd immunity. people can't get vaccinations (kids cancer, etc). enough people antibodies (through self-immunity vaccine) can't lower risk getting disease Oh must related. mother's side actually money somewhere trust grandkids. found papers maybe 15 years ago asked mom told I'm sure much plan uncle suing it. 

It came recently told planned happening seemed shocked. told one told said well guess planned adult life around get money pass extra suprise. probably best plan life waiting inheritance. us. We're fucked idiots, though. Yeah one common things I've heard Teachers either quiting day opening simply showing up.  UGA alum. confirm. ""sLoW TeStInG dOwN!"" Mmm Brawndo. It’s plants crave! want one super bowl Vikings die People, even sub, actually believe death figures accurate. I'm pretty sure one realizes they're already lied to. There's 0 chance there's 50% immunity New York. anything, antibody tests could also showing opposite people testing positive antibodies incorrectly too.

But even Long Island numbers concerning people understand curve stays flat continuously flatten virus eradicated. Sooo 5 cases today... :( Sorry record breaking Wi. That's horrible hear  entire time happening need sedated.

It seems corona often goes bad quickly initial intubation done sedation takes effect. bit unpleasant.

Technically speaking sedation also required afterwards patient properly tied try rip tube out. Fuck that. I'd call cynicism I'd call people selfish. made spend 4-8 hours day selling useless shit assholes want argue maybe even start fist fight employer's mask requirement, think I'd say, ""Fuck shit, I'm going want, too."" That’s left lung, surely right lung fine Ron DeDeathSentence College worth person either. need get cases drastically down, build supplies, aggressive testing contact tracing prevent new cases first wave dies down. 

US never even let first wave die. reopening still getting 10's thousands cases day. I'm happy see study think great example masks make huge difference. However, fuck stylist working SYMPTOMS 8 days!?!?! Texans: ""A people dying ain't gonna scare us.""

Covid crippling ability treat people: ""Listen little shits."" Smfh Wow okay that’s nuts. point governor one can’t exercise emergency powers. 

Stay away Michigan ;) even close. AZ 90 deaths. fake Maxime Bernier got around 1000 votes within 800 votes Green Party NDP riding There’s pretty much zero evidence people infected twice time

For disease that's around approximate time takes immunity wear off, yes would expected.

I'm lying, I'm referencing researchers field making warnings. I've seen one credible saying warnings illegitimate. random redditors. Honestly, given teachers definitely workers affected point considering federal government trying push everyone back unsafe work conditions forcing sign away right sue, surprised point general strike actually happens. crazy times given disconnect leaders everyday citizens, think people gonna get pretty fed shit couple months higher death toll. small businesses start going mass, started already, people going get point feel like nothing lose. guess might general strike due amount people I'd expect street who've lost everything unemployed.

I'm believer theory 'covid time', social political changes happen excelarated pace. There's already plenty instances happening, good, bad. changes thought unthinkable decades away occurring suddenly becoming possible present that's want spend time talking about, problem, yours. problems US fix. cares exist. do. Let's stop talking blame start talking solutions. Yes. 3 kids - two toddlers. Lots milk, vegetables, snacks. much meat anymore. pack meat get $20??!?!

I think might ice cream pushing amounts. Part thing shop online pickup groceries. used go shopping times week know could get something cheaper somewhere else.

Some ready-to-eat packages (like lunchables, macaroni cups, quick-serve items) definitely push up. gotta gotta work. nurse, plans meals meticulously days works since gone 14 hours day (12 hours commute).

I know (and used to) shop cheaper (like going sprouts getting real food get processed machines), we're trying minimize store time much can. price pay, literally. complaining, eager stores get competitive dine-out options. laughed laughed Las Vegas' mayor said willing let control group. Texas stepped done us. 

Thanks, Texas. bodies necessarily reliable

My Anti-bodies definitely unreliable. stay night, drinking, gambling... show hung next morning. I've never seen pizza McDonald's, maybe eastern Canada thing? poutine west coast. nothing value lost.

The Trump administration ordered hospitals bypass Centers Disease Control Prevention and, beginning Wednesday, send coronavirus patient information central database Washington — move alarmed public health experts fear data distorted political gain.

The new instructions contained little-noticed document posted week Department Health Human Services’ website, Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports. on, H.H.S., C.D.C., collect daily reports patients hospital treating, many beds ventilators available, information vital tracking pandemic.

Officials say change streamline data gathering assist White House coronavirus task force allocating scarce supplies like personal protective gear drug remdesivir. hospital officials welcome move, saying relieve responding requests multiple federal agencies, though others said C.D.C. collecting data.

“The C.D.C. right agency forefront collecting data,” said Dr. Bala Hota, chief analytics officer Rush University Medical Center Chicago.

Public health experts long expressed concerns administration politicizing science undermining disease control centers; four former C.D.C. directors, spanning Republican Democratic administrations, said much opinion piece published Tuesday Washington Post. data collection shift reinforced fears.

“Centralizing control data umbrella inherently political apparatus dangerous breeds distrust,” said Nicole Lurie, served assistant secretary preparedness response former President Barack Obama. “It appears cut ability agencies like C.D.C. basic job.”

The shift grew tense conference call several weeks ago hospital executives Dr. Deborah L. Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator.

After Dr. Birx complained hospitals adequately reporting data, convened working group government hospital officials devised new plan, according Janis Orlowski, chief health care officer Association American Medical Colleges, participated.

But news change came shock inside C.D.C., long responsible gathering public health data, according two officials spoke condition anonymity authorized discuss it. spokesman disease control centers referred questions Department Health Human Services, responded request comment.

The dispute exposes vast gaps government’s ability collect manage health data — antiquated system best, experts say.

Nobody head fully screwed takes Kemp seriously, failure corrupt dimwit, likely let issue die courts simply ignored, since unlikely Kemp actually shit it.

But also live suburban northeast town currently surge. Contrast US places like Florida Arizona exploding hospitals overwhelmed - even governors implemented shutdowns May

This exact scenario Swedish officials anticipated way back March. Basically, push restrictions hard long, people going get fatigued stop listening government says, second wave hits, got nothing. start, Swedish approach use restrictions possible, wasted political clout goodwill if/when really need later.

In addition, Americans generally less healthy, worse expensive healthcare, way worse sick pay policies, therefore ""desperate"" get back work. Sweden, government currently covers sick pay everyone, strong recommendations stay home get sick pay symptoms all, people that. America, lawmakers instead busy making sure employees can't sue employers ""force"" people back work... difference mentality like night day.

And top that, Americans general trust government, selfish, whole thing got weirdly politicized covid karens going around actively maliciously sabotaging things.

The good news though lockdowns much less impact people think, ~~herd immunity~~ community resistance easier achieve think, lot people infected lot people died, virus die new hotspots well, regardless public policy. cheese Poverty wages Texas. means rich even upper middle class. 


But Poverty stricken Texas. Now, trajectory nature housing market lies economy. 


But get $35,000 major cities Texas. Moreso, roommate. Kansas City metro area. solid BBQ place apparently run dumbasses. 

For part KC done ok Covid. hot spots Leavenworth (the prison) St Joe (meat processing plant). locations 45 minutes city. We're perfect we're trying. maybe knows it’s bullshit hysteria media created effort rock boat get trump office result wearing masks? I'm curious places able get rid it. US still idea we're doing.

Masks may helping prevalent might think. mostly we've taken things seriously start responded quickly. Yes, technically remote neighbouring state (North Dakota - city (ie: dense population) nearly size Winnipeg) 4493 positive cases vs 330. YES, done roughly half testing ND has, account 10x higher number cases ND (which state-wide population largest city, *helps* explain higher number, still come close explaining away).

Another factor might help: actually get sick Canada, check hospital treated cost patient, probably encourages people sick actually seek care get treated/isolated. I’m RN Houston hospital admins using site record accurate hospital numbers (under covid data reports) - Ny screwed unknowns everyone infected. closed late cat already bag. realize though don’t want everyone bucked wears masks

Florida Texas ignored reality knowing coming dumb it.  Plenty time prep close wear masks. God forbid lean ny repeat them. smelling breath mask bad need better dental hygiene [immunity temp facts pretty settled. Let's pretend status update 2 weeks anyone even knowing now. seems like really awful thing someone, expose medical information employer.

How HIPAA violation immunity previously gotten disease also involve t-cells anti-bodies? California? One without symptoms infects another one without symptoms. unlikely without symptoms.  Along Sweden, Finland, Canada, Australia, Germany.

Not sure data looking at. take literally months cases surge Florida? surge exactly time California's did?

Because Florida shut late incompletely April 1, reopened far soon May 4. Again, current positive case rate 18%, take months surge -- number infected many times currently listed poor testing contact tracing (which noted problem, first post). plainly, take months surge, simply testing / contact tracing enough see bad numbers truly are.

California **did not** surge time Florida. California big surge first month, ***linearly increasing*** ever since (thanks Governor Newsom's restrictions). Florida's cases grew much quickly first, slowed April shut down, shot ***exponentially*** day 80 restrictions lifted.

Not even remotely growth curves two states, see easily look [**FinancialTimes graph two states - one hold waiting long, another hold early, experienced curve (in case months cases started coming in).

They curves, all. Look graph link that's even addressing states like Illinois, who, again, hold acting early, death counts way 2x states hold acting late (and Cook County cases county country).

Of course death count higher: Illinois Chicago, second-largest city country New York City, population density 11,847 people per square mile. Patient zero Chicago came mid-January, Wuhan. Early restrictions simply kept things reaching New York City County cases county country.

Nope. [Los Angeles County dubious distinction three weeks, Florida get slammed late March early April?

Florida **was** getting slammed, testing much. Medical examiners' records show [a lot people dying Governor DeSantis: ""If go back ... beginning April, even 10,000 test results day."" testing less March. likely scant contact tracing. state 21½ million estimates IFR somewhere around 0.2%

Nope. Current estimates IFR ***the entire population*** [three five times higher \-- 0.6% 1%. comparison, seasonal *i*nfluenza IFR 0.1% .

**But -- IFR people aged 65 older jumps 5.6% . comparison, Spanish Flu (the one killed 50 million people) IFR 2.5%**

So, I'll ask -- data need see, number percentage statistic would convince Bad Thing? Gee wonder country happened arent *useless*, aren’t 100% effective. mitigate risk, eliminate it. Yup even special areas take mask that's *fantastic* idea. I'm Florida everyone stupid fuck making realize every Florida meme true. We're dick U.S. we're starting flare hurts pees. said masks work enough front line workers want hoarding. halfway herd immunity depending theory use? Yeah, Boomers running scared. (And that, mean cowering home.) Spartanburg Frankly masks seem easier keep face shields kids.

For anec-data, 4 year old back daycare, kids need wear masks throughout day compliance shockingly high. Welldone NYC 🙌. shame rest America bubbling steaming hot mess.

Since then, developed low grade fever (100.1-100.7) two separate days (7/8 today), mid high 99s days. Runny nose sneezing symptoms.

There different levels risk.

We President says CDC lying everything; exactly think federal government going make progress all?

As public deserves, public elected administration. They're getting exactly deserve. also elected incompetent governors states like FL AZ, again, people states getting deserve. wanted incompetent government, voted got it. That's problem democracy: people stupid choose good leadership, get bad leadership, one blame. agree fault mask people least great degree. thsts punished all. like robbed someone police closed business instead going robber committed crime. Came say exactly this. think stigma teachers easier switching online courses easier it. Let tell you- worked twice hard amount course work overall try make class entertaining zoom worked hard come creative ways interactive group activities remote (this breakout rooms). 

Adjunct professors furloughed means work FT professors. universities decrease pay per demands students, means decrease pay professors double workload. 

The entire education system needs changed. see win-win situation stands. Guy, man hate. feel personally attacked somehow. blacks Latinos suffering more, moment. Well, half people tourists Texas probably help. went theme park yesterday 100% masks required, 33% capacity, rides wiped every 10 rides, ride seats socially distanced. felt pretty safe. sad thing soon see wrong get control many personally lose loved ones this. sad go far see it. turned Texas alerts phone. would constantly get Amber/grey alerts 2am people 5 hours away. ""Nothing see here"" says every r3d state routinely under-report deaths. live little west Cleveland someone know flew Vegas vacation. middle aged works health care. know better... Boycott Disney. Disney World. Disney movies, stores, ABC, ESPN, Disney+, Fox, Hulu, Marvel... slaughtering people money. take deep breath, close eyes, stop instants.

it's far over... yes, current times ideal, suck actually. time back ounce considered normal, life too. anything, hard times discover ourselves, ability adapt emerge side new scars (to proud of!) found appreciation small things forgot surrounded mundanity. also see people around, find really hang to.

we're coasting now, rough terrain (and unemployment offices mess, colleague going CA limbo)... we'll fine eventually. take step outside dark, one-in-a-lifetime comet admire tonight, amazing free. Correct. Gov letting cities burn. asking help weeks. won’t budge. Burn burn burn. Climate change denial understand little better. effects aren’t face way average person would notice it. 

But everyone know understand coughing, sneezing, talking, etc spreads germs viruses we’ve seen happen one time another, especially kids. 

There’s excuse denying either though, don’t get wrong. WINWINWINWINWIN
OMFG we're gonna beat everybody  know several companies make good money that. Maybe need education yourself? creative? imaginative? staring past multiple windows. window showing different moment time.

 jump conclusions, misinterpret data understand. make effort read educate yourself, Facebook reddit. Agreed. think bank statements checked reach alaska/drive back south every non essential way purchase carry fine. plenty data prove you’re wrong. NY 36th per capita death rates long term care facilities.  please keep believing facts.  Source: NYT long term care facilities death rates 

Also, EO based republican CDC guidelines time.  

So you’re wrong every part comment. Yes. rural Oregonians pushing reopening wasnt area. said need stay closed wear masks. people started going get services, like hair cuts vacation.... this. like Idaho. problem. Now. is. Isn’t crazy opponent - ex meth user - would likely done much better job handling given would bot shoves head Trumps like DeSantis did? America. holy sh&amp;t cluster f&amp;ck mean though? Providing contact information? call check people visiting NY? note this, follow set data believe they\`re using here. 208 306 hospitals report numbers, that's almost quarter known hospitals ICU beds. Another 28 one ICU bed left. Another 68 two ICU beds left. 

So yeah, 208 hospitals reporting data 143 reporting 0 2 ICU beds left. heartbreaking ;( Hey bud! Looks like active again. Would mind responding comment call insulting autistic kid using gain sympathy losing argument... Cause actually feel rather ""clever"" one :) Well hospitalizations stabilizing. Can't increase number available... states obfuscating death data well behind testing, people die without getting tested never counted. pretty big effort states downplay deaths, especially Florida. :/ pretty spot on, you’ve got admit! think he’s normally storm chaser. Never happened FL (big shock) will. Remember people Italy freaking loved ones dying rotten front enough resources pick corpses? perhaps said, ""Never gonna happen America"".

Well, worse Italy regarding infection rates. So. Yeah, could happen here. 40s gone. 2nd surge preventable. RIP Yeah I’m sure make people don’t wear mask want wear mask insult try shame them. make political insulting people. God hate shaming politics deepen divide good. kids go private school. totally see enrollment depending public schools handled learning home situation. buddy’s kid’s learn home school basically sign Khan Academy say hi teacher week. furious. wants fired. 

For me, private school offered smaller class sizes, flexibility, class excelled whole. Meaning teacher students didn’t wait slower ones catch up. school starts fall, kids going continue remote learning school perfectly fine that. Attendance isn’t required get paid state. 

I could buy Porsche, I’d rather better school kids now, keep safe assholes care money student’s health. think is, teach countries do. don’t know functioning really. Yet hear great plans ones return. honestly think corporations stay try nationalize them? Workers cheaper elsewhere right keeps strength US purchasing power (ie much stuff US citizens buy) fact home. really think Bezos would choose lose Amazon stay instead moving another country? get piece included joke, land. 

At least pandemic, Disney properties always reputation ""Not Happiest Place Earth, damn near cleanest too! try &amp; throw something ground, one legions 'cast members' snatch quickness!"" feel confident go extent deaths lagging degree I’m sure much. time, think better treating smaller percentage sick people die. Also, seems young people getting fair better. open windows then. Thinking it, reality know indoor areas air conditioning dealing Florida temperatures.  mean senior citizens csnt handle higher Temps well.

I think thry shut whole park dint, think kinds places necessary. Bezos cant take infrastructure stock.  tries run Amazon another tax jurisdiction put sanctions bank deals him. Fuck like guys fuck Iranians. could pay tax. You’re boring tears right now. Sorry hear you’ve gone unless you’re 90 years old heart rate well 128 intense exercise. sure don’t something else going on? Sorry sauce like existence. Auth-right certain disaster. NY already preparingat home classes like did. leaves single families shit luck. work, unemployment wont enough people. cant leave kids home alone. people need two incomes. neccessary keep people safe go well people can't get money live sympathies. know american couple tried claim refugee status Trump won, first try it. way country going though...  God click link. lost half brain cells.  Umm... False. maskholes

I love it! possible heard word 'maskholes' yet? read news several forums pretty much daily.

You enriched life, thank you! No. There's evidence asymptomatic patients getting blood clots after. know, there's brown people blame something Americans gladly give away freedoms. want leave Canada (rightfully) locked border 😭 guy show gun next freeway honked him. Course lawnmowers hat different kind I'm sure got pass. think crazier Rubio moment give times. said ones support him. lot great people Texas! Interesting. hadn’t thought learning classroom equalizer before. Cali right track sure. Well understand hard lockdown Wuhan early days best way.

Edit: serious, downvoted? know lockdown harsh, though necessary, may improved. Make permanent. Build wall, keep third-world out.  fiancé Canadian citizen PR? allowed fly US visit re-enter Canada anytime wish return required self-isolate 14 days upon arrival. (I realize last bit may make trip impossible due work responsibilities.) Actually, parties position power, Democrats nothing, Republicans actively made MUCH worse. Faced two choices, one bureaucratic nonsense inept anything, coordinated looking harm whenever possible.

I hate say vote least bad option, I'm trapped burning building, one person standing looking nothing, one bucket gasoline, think I'm going go one nothing least see buy time figure better option. Union Halls used stepping stone many people enter skilled trades.

You go hall sign up, get apprenticeship card, get job skilled trades training paid getting benefits. 

Now hear ads ""technical schools"" unaccredited sucker people use Pell grant GI Bill money, charging $20-30k 12 months training job that's $15/hr. interesting Abbott TX EXACTLY thing? almost like specific strategy. Dare call agenda?? /s wine tastings closed this. reason believe still open? need stop punishing people poor resources better themselves. alone would improve things significantly.  conservatism dangerous outside seems like financial responsibility values true goal conservatism using economics public policy oppress undesirables. I’m asthmatic, also Coloradoan. wear mask everywhere (not go anywhere super public) solely protect selfish bastards wearing masks. hate people using breathing problems excuse. think it’s hard breathe now, wait exposed virus fing idiots!!!!! Gun wielding maniac sounds right also think freedom means freedom consequences. one covid-deniers would dare tell insurance providers wear masks practice social distancing. held accountable, feel invincible, aren't. conspicuous omission ""out"" haha President needs sign executive order, mandatory masks every state inside public place, exception.

This insane thing I've read Reddit day. like expecting Xi Jinping make public announcement proclaiming China going adopt multi-party democratic system. thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I explain Manitoba's secret weapon keeping infections getting in: one wants go Manitoba.

I tease. Great work guys, keep up! agree weren’t states like New York specifically refraining collecting information? since aren’t (and shouldn’t) create database everyone protests, would find difficult make claim level certainty strongly disagree article states. telling protests, thousands (possibly tens thousands) people attended, often coming close proximity protestors (and police forces), least contributing factor rise COVID cases US? mention number people practicing poor hygiene (touching surfaces, touching mouths) wearing masks (not all, there's sizeable number protestors wear mask). Uh, understand sarcasm? 
Read post again, dude. Carefully. Slowly. Analytically. tragic know simple things mitigate epidemic, segment public stubborn, selfish, stupid it. evidence BLM protests increase cases (in fact, may reduced cases people stayed home instead going bars restaurants protests) care anyway want make screwed-up political point. confirm lived Northern Southern California. cynicism liberals really turns off. general, stupidity comes understandiong economies capitalism works. side Cleetus inbred cousins.

Glad done, jeez talk late....exponential growth incubation time means results seen least week. keep seeing governors always numbers already way high, never before. Yeah cancel, really hard. [Or University California actually raised tuition. every year, year different. Yes.

If mean virus, sure. Disease? No. Bacterial diseases frequently completely cured. Congenital defects? Many well cured surgeries. diseases, including rather serious ones, cured diet. Oh, replied wrong comment, think. people learn, comes America UK, worst case scenario usually means best case scenario three months road. *I like picture Jesus wearing mesh mask, 'cause says like 'i wanna protected, im party, too'... cause like party, like Jesus party* Wow bullshit.

That said, agree rest post. sad (in eyes) they've been

~~asked listen experts, considerate others, work together get this~~

so inconvenienced, put upon, persecuted! wonder many times people checked stat since March? Search job Canada (or somwhere else), move, done.

This 14 years ago (Germany Switzerland).

All need ""egoism"" say bye bye others plus need love country moving go back (home).  know sarcastic, sad millions Americans say shit like completely serious. This!!! Luckily we're good making employees wear masks restuarant, behind scenes ""anything goes"" management literally told me, ""You back here. one cares."" real? Even feel way, make sense play safe morale?  Yeah, that’s common knowledge. Hence, stupid ones die. can’t reason people don’t want facts; segment nation needs go. sure he’s praising Abbott, said going shut Bankruptcy somewhat complex topic, honestly much started with, would done better investing instead.  likely; done research Georgia state law. 

Most time, states hold supremacy cities organized subordinate entities. simply boils Georgia law allows cities stringent emergency powers permitted governor's office. 

City emergency powers state emergency powers could entirely separate, could specifically addressed via statute.

However, cities always incorporated state law, never federal. federal government recognizes authority states, absolute right regulate legal entities within border.  fact think wore masks says everything. Bullshit. cursory look videos online protests tell true slightest. I'm arguing that, literally laying facts come me. Wynn long said schools remain empty closed, may well true. dad emergency pilot, sometimes works y’all northern Florida. Thank work. I’m sorry it’s bad. Obviously bet family wear PPE. COVID-19 scares dad motorcycles power tools. him, it’s strange change mostly freak accidents adults virus. one another, moved hospitals full can’t help severely sick people. guy private education always seemed give students upper hand, kids aren’t good area enough money won’t opportunity experience (and mean Charters privates). I’m NASCAR fan I’d take baseball. still national sport? WA sales tax purchases

Hell yeah do. sales tax Seattle 10 fucking percent. female direction. That’s buy jeans 80s online waist expected dramatically rather gut wider hips. days Americans carrying weight upper back torso, rectangular jeans made reflect this.

The new population blob shaped clothes don’t even observe dimorphism males females anymore.  comment pro really matters. somewhat unclear, searching.

The Florida DOH reports PCR Antibody testing together, likely % positive lower (they report 11.3% test positive rate today). sources use FDOH numbers aggregate differently allow better picture pandemic progress. [Source numbers Covid Tracking Project Yesterday: 65,567 new tests, 12,624 new cases, 19.2% positive
* Previous Monday: 33,741 tests, 6,336 cases, 18.7% positive ""...rapid release cytokines""
So triggered cytokine storm? I'm disappointed College biggest fucking scam ever. wouldn’t say exactly pretty darn close - statewide mask order took power away local governments issue stay home orders. many days judge Houston begged stay home order??? Dallas Fort Worth ISD begging allow us open schools virtually first nine weeks without cutting funding. He’s going start making decisions soon. teach north Texas go back short weeks NOTHING planned ppe. Wow, that’s awesome. mother law sounds like she’s really engaging excellent job. absolutely insane statistic saw reporter. 

Australia (population 25 million) 9,980 cases, according data Monday Johns Hopkins University.

South Korea (population 51 million) 13,479 cases Monday.

Florida (population 21 million) 282,435 cases ❤️ Dr Fauci It’s probably less 60%. It’s lot complicated simple formula got passed around March. 

But it’s probably lot higher hoping reach person didn’t say doctor. said presumed positive doctor. What’s trend look like deaths 12 states allow teachers strike without repercussions. Teachers still technically strike, state holds power revoke license earned benefits so. 

It would dangerous weather COVID-19 storm homeless without health insurance one “made example of”.

Quite teachers able quit without losing everything already here. autopsies say otherwise Ron Reaper Sure stayed whole comment I’m glad May ask voted him? curious reason, I'm US really follow election.

Amazing people like fall propaganda attack people disagreeing pre-determined narrative.  irritating I've left house like 3 times last 6 months. Work home.

Yet I'm living family goes visits extended family takes kids crowded pools. drive across 3 states, generally give shit... frequent barbecues....

If get sick die, it'll hands family. mental health fucked. I'm paranoid shit traveling room via A/C. Cue exodus Texans want ensure biblical plage. Yeah misleading headline Probably hospitals still need PPE  Well, let team down. doubt contacted virus though. likely got last two weeks.  We’re way past “civil debate”

Please this. plenty Americans. I’m one them. simply understand reaction many people around me. american absolutely right. even school never stop studying learning. people buy shit read. america thats somewhere around 30% ish population would guess. Real talk ive never ashamed call american. outbreak revealed much shit america. happens literally everywhere else too, yet managed everything finally flattening rise, outright eradicating it. wish could get shit together don’t waste another year life BS bad federal government interfered state government. NYC resident working home never infected - Bwahahahahaha, fucking clueless. true. People look opportunities start trouble. It’s like people show protests riot gear. guys intention wasn’t eat, make statement. Yea agree. Manitoba pretty common Truckers Trains though that’s get cases now

Outdoor transmission remains rare nonexistent Mine pathetic. met nice lady thought could go somewhere boom...pandemic. auto-immune disease despite otherwise healthy. that's no-go. Fuck virus! intelligent comment here. Ah. Yes. Taught Trump University doubt. Dude. Sweden disaster. They’ve admitted herd immunity wasn’t right way go antibodies last several weeks.

Herd immunity never achieved. vaccine way ends Flu seems like good proxy observing secondary effects effectiveness behaviour changes response COVID.

It seems pretty apparent lockdowns/social distancing marked effect influenza - month that's usually quite bad.

Obviously lab reported cases, therefore likely short actual number, difference stark.  Yeah like sometimescars go left others go lefter A&amp;M definitely make it, least better most. former students support school fervently donate lot university. big donors rank file middle class suburban ones especially. Please safe come eh?🙄 Schools Europe let younger kids come back kept 10-15 classroom pretty well. outbreaks. doubt could replicate kind distancing here. Schools older kids go back issues. concerning levels outbreaks saw Israeli South African schools. comparison study released days ago info one place. time later I’ll try find post link here. [Here 2010

and many others......But yet zero random controlled studies show actually work. . weakest pathetic. Many states barely even participated. biggest idiots started opening bars restaurants early May. cowardly response. NJ. Wolf made mandatory Murphy. lmao, somewhat strawman. OP clearly meant state many people working home would worse otherwise, cannot deserve respect. hardly perfect. economy fueled corpses dead. things start shutting workers get sick creating domino affect, shutting economy uncontrolled way. least 18 months go. That's people tired. friends. family. People can't date. Kids can't play friends. 

If partner working home kids, experience order magnitude easier most. Close borders. Seriously. work pizza restaurant get ton online orders lol ones know person lol. Let’s forget one first official COVID cases NY came FLORIDA! (And superspreader led hotspot Westchester also led first official COVID case NJ led first official death NJ). Worldometers says twice many new infections daily April. Yet half number new deaths daily April. testing rate doubled since April. Deaths 25% since June.

Does mean testing more, naturally cases logged, total number daily new cases actual reflection infection rate actually drastically increased since April? death rate going skyrocket weeks, due increase actual (versus confirmed) infections? 

It's serious question. feel stupid, need ELI5 explanation. think would need take vaccine often religious/political mafia. Wow. wow. pay $280 go disney world even covid-free. really still know. Seems like small chance could give cat cat would almost certainly show mild signs. small chance cat could give someone else. know positive quarantine quarantine cat worry would approach. disinformation enemy, honesty warpath. Article June 26   Basically told parents stuck kids fall, boss unlikely get second term. ability retain piece information, it. Forced use product work. Incredibly unimpressed. That's nice think masks bad masks represent science they've gone entire lives understanding thus disbelieving science, posting unscientific bullshit computers onto internet, made science, comfortably air conditioned homes cooled science...

it goes literally bottom stupidity. Violence never answer. 😎 going pandemics polar caps continue melt unleashing pathogens human ever encountered before.  lucky virus type familiar mitigate true new viruses bacteria may start popping up.  could easily one pandemic away extinction event. both?  Yup. wife works covid patients. N95, surgical, face shield, gloves. one team gotten shit.

Incredibly good argument. mask tiny small request stop PANDEMIC course humanity. thing Arizona already close NY cases per capita, half cases last month. Better treatments work medical structure support patients process giving them, % ICU beds available 

Add New York full lockdown weeks hitting peak numbers compared Arizona starting wear masks, though statewide far know, seems like fair amount pushback, it\`s hard see people could compare two.

Don\`t get wrong, I\`d love people lived. I\`m rooting idea Vitamin leads better outcomes southern states, better treatments gamechanger, heat kills virus, etc. It\`s hard optimistic know really easy Americans dehumanize prisoners particularly blame propaganda machine fully backing prison industrial complex sweet sweet profits therein think story prisoners dying old are, it? remember wear mask then! majority Americans feel US owns Europe, fact that's dismantled Europe's recent travel ban Americans. generation going dumb.  Back school 2025? Might well embrace idiocracy.  Enlighten people still don’t wear seatbelts think they’ll able react time, seatbelt leave bruise get accident (as wouldn’t get injured weren’t wearing seatbelt accident), they’re worried they’ll get stuck seatbelt car explode. Legit, heard excuses. that's call magical thinking. Come on, article Global Times? tabloid press China. even Chinese take Global Times seriously. take it. I’m curious, current demographic infections younger population? many infected young people showing ICU/hospitals, area, (higher percentage) young people needing hospital? Yes think concern children, also families teachers. 

I think schools need open afford kids home helps community taking one individual equation. School public service honestly families without year can't. many stages there? Every death play role historic Haunted Mansion!   u/Mighty_L_LORT right though.... international students pay full tuition, offsets costs Americans get scholarship rides.  That’s we’re going huge increase cases! Masks, new pants tadaaaa. support people’s right protest, going protest means take certain risks getting spreading virus people reason don’t want admit regards black lives matter protests. Could stupid person leading Dept Ed? incredibly myopic don’t even know begin. make detour via third state list then... mean like fucking president? would probably found proper treatment stop people declining health. count. read story known transmissions blm protests. 

I wish could write /S really posted over. cities smart mandating like cocoa cocoa beach others right. Stay away Florida. Especially big cities!! sucks. Yep. found hilarious stimulus included $600 week McConnell tried repeal lot people making money unemployment jobs. goes show weak labor become decades $600 week millions Americans make. knock effects going long lasting. Biden needs start thinking BIG, like really fucking big wants economy look like next 100 years. 

Trump driven supporters far left field, don’t think they’re ever going able come back. killed Neo-Cons. Romney wing millionaires can’t possibly pull together enough votes evangelicals shrinking demographic. Suburban white women fine bashing Muslim skulls middle-East. fine deadly respiratory viruses ignored. Without constituency, national Republican Party. guess who’s going win bunch state houses right district lines get redrawn. Trump may ended R party dominance long time. someone told Trump liberal plant destroy R party, wouldn’t shocked. He’s bang job it. concerning, patients hospitalized covid likely severe critical case virus. It’s possible, half 20% severe-critical patients heart problems, could uncommon complication covid whole. Taking account asymptomatic cases remain undiagnosed would make percentage abnormal heart scans lower.

These factors precisely fatality rate isn’t measuring stick need use evaluate seriousness virus. **Foxnews A.O.K w/ this** Serious question: u/thraw3000 unable find higher paying work graduate degree accounting? possibilities come mind (keeping mind TOTALLY ignorant accounting): got degree lower-tier University help networking, 'practical/co-op' work facilitated post-degree connections, live area accounting skills high demand, degree stress 'practical/job-ready skills', personal limitations allow take advantage opportunities outside current home/city, excel field (but obviously finished degree), get good references program professors, etc. tens thousands accounting jobs globally, I'm trying understand career path panned you? better be.

 Yeah, wtf saw one story “Coronavirus destroying ionizing church air filter spectacular!”  


We really ruled fkn morons. ""Only 0.02% kids die."" already said okay it. 

You say /s many people say seriously.

It's terrifying. Fair enough. least fact permanent world views are. world runs food, people die starvation? Sure food grows plants trees. still need people harvest it. Economy economy.  he'll get scot free that's world 2020. young remember companies stocks went unreal levels number clicks got websites - 1999 /2000 . ended well/s wish mythical 'deep state' real control. Anything ""in control"" would better GOP shit-show. rundown costs move Canada. final price rundown costs \~5,000 $ USD move work permit (if find job ahead time *and* willing work non-citizen years *and* get lucky) want move 2021 end spending 17,000-32,000 $ USD still might even get move.

You're solution add tremendous cost. Somebody evaluate every submission funds.. Yeah.. That's good idea... 

Just look highest education level world copy that. leadt parts it. 

It's figured out. Right? thought mandatory month ago, everywhere go people wearing masks, think I've seen handful people outside businesses wearing masks. Thank God majority around seem taking seriously least. agree US general dropped ball hard, particularly federal government, also many states. think equally significant factor also culture encourages people act selflessly responsibly. 

My state quick shut numbers reflected it. tried extremely careful reopening time I've go business, tons precautions, felt safe could possibly feel interacting people away home. 

I think would sitting pretty here, everyone would taken seriously, worn masks gathered together social activities. case numbers started explode contract tracing shown businesses opened, private get-togethers -- bachelor parties, frat parties, weddings graduation parties shown sources recent outbreaks. carefully planned limitations rules mean nothing citizens also take responsibility changing behavior limit spread protect fellow citizens. 

Now rule private gatherings 10 people, people can't even trusted own. people go ""nanny state"" go recklessly endanger everyone else, government crack lose freedom. long would taken rebellion start?

There one.

The right obviously rebelled Trump ordered it, must good. 
The left rebelled Fauci would agreed Trump. talking deaf ears say that. 

To whatever survival rate long 95% interpret meaning ""Not Me.""

For reason ever consider would possibly one people could potentially die virus.  consider getting sick would minor inconvenience. intelligence process number means real terms care. 

As long 'not them' give shit hurt, whose life ruined, whose family destroyed; fucking concern them. can’t even imagine single parents parents can’t work remotely going through. can’t stay class day, someone tests positive class goes virtual weeks. Worse idiot. recent trend sounds like active bomb US politics threatens destabilise 40 years political maneuvering. 

This individuals anymore. Lmfao irony seriousness sending Comfort Florida? Surely extra beds needed. Well, consider Alaska 2.5x size Manitoba half population, yesterday announced 116 new cases, 93 residents. [Here's nifty case counts yesterday see spread almost every part state, cities. That’s said “people” said it. It’s said. 

He’s taking responsibility lot people aren’t him. It’s good leaders do. accept blame even it’s fault, conversation move forward solutions away fault.

Him demonstrating good leadership traits doesn’t make liar. means gives damn right thing saving lives himself. Ah, PEI strategy!  place terrifying. neighbors constantly parties completely ridiculed community Facebook page brought numbers. compared flat earther discussing fact we’re fucked. next door neighbors hosted pool parties every weekend since beach. And, feel bad, hope one contracts shit slows down. However, there’s three hundred homes community appears they’re fucking rednecks little bit money.

Especially time? advice, stop procrastinating things is; embrace feeling lost leave “the system” time monetize one actual passions know you’re talking about

If guys passion hip hop dance, needs stop beating around bush pursue that, ‘socially acceptable’ version wondering someone IQ 25 could even comprehend this, realised measurement referred Fahrenheit Celsius 😂 Cant force lockdowns schools? POTUS reopening schools demands...   Well said. It’s unfortunate don’t see practical solution people never empathy lives. Facts welcome reddit covid subs That’s source website uses accurate doesn’t quite understand Colorado displays it’s data.

Colorado’s 5% twice since May: July 6th July 9th. (Flip positivity chart near bottom “Daily” 3-day moving I'm sure there's scenario flashing gun kid working take-out could dick move, explanation no. mean provinces took seriously? think many states didnt take seriously?

Yes states got results. New York, Michigan, Massachusetts, NE. 

The problem states ones seeing surge now. Texas, Georgia, Arizona Florida definitely not. reaping sow now. California something else went wrong there. 

By contrast every Canadian province (regardless political leanings) took seriously. even though 6 diffeent polticial parties power federal provincial levels vastly different ideologies managed work together one goal. Canada also huge country tiny population. guys dont metro areas 15 million people.

Our population also concentrated. Windsor Quebec city corridor alone represents 55 percent population. Add Calgary-Edmonton Lower Mainland (specifically Metro Vancouver) 75 percent. 

We also much higher transit use. tend live smaller homes likely live multifamily buildings yet much better. Rising compared last week maybe, way compared highs April. 

Maybe we're headed toward new peak there's little evidence suggest currently. 

 

Current excess death statistics CDC basically confirm numbers accurate. currently seeing deaths would expect see without COVID. small amount deaths even register. context, many people state Florida test today vs last Monday? 

Can’t use one without other. directly related find % positive tests increasing testing capacity increased. make example Florida let try fix own. Need learn lesson somehow. Like raising kid. Jiminy crickets, that’s lotta dough! Apparently Ivy League colleges recognize recruit fancy private schools... they’re spending double college education get kids prestigious college, pay 4x average college education guess. kid 6 college educations. 

Also you’re parent fellow parent friends sending kids fancy pants private school, well gotta keep right?

But yeah public schools absolutely incredible, advanced tech wise ton money, you’re spot on. Parcel taxes ftw. They're also safer expel anyone wear mask. Well could try focusing beefing computer work home skills like programming graphic designing making music, mean else fails euphoric drugs still waiting consumed, you’ve almost exhausted resources maybe vaccine available life go back normal you’re going withdrawals. Cheaper, faster, performed poorly high school it’s chance redeem wear masks? I'm Alberta, sadly case here. Another mental midget. NJ number one New York 10th.please stop pulling data ass.

Straight There's herd immunity poor neighborhoods now. dry bushes burnt.

Rich areas basically forest fire waiting happen since everyone sheltered. Edited, left wrong one, admit typo.  

Can admit reading comprehension inadequate? think Americans worried venting got bombed Japan? No, picked figured fuck it. like social environment start working transform it. Complaining internet people already agree fucking stupid. [Jesus Tapdancing Christ, people must live completely different *seriously* jumping conclusion based *one* case *one* doctor? 

There people who’ve gotten measles twice, that’s disease afford lifelong immunity 99.999 percent people infects. 

Cases like need examined, certainly, it’s fucking ridiculous jump straight assumption immunity doesn’t exist, mountain evidence contrary. alert remember getting NY message begging anyone medical background come help hospitals, pretty terrifying. possible remember getting shelter-in-place alert, plea help really sticks mind. I’m surprised you’re surprised found bunch Americans people living America privileged POS. must love today’s politicians, stupid protesting, everyone else without mask. mention continue ~~liter~~ litter, too. stubbed toe doc. Fauci: need amputate whole leg. guy CCP puppet r/ emojipresident

Fauci served six presidents nation's foremost expert pandemic response. terrifying me, little brother moved Florida teaching class next year already know they’re going close schools Personally, blame governments distributing school funds based property taxes money staying specific communities.

That means rich parts town get want nice expensive houses poor parts town struggle keep band programs funded.

Ideally, money allotted based need. minimum allotment state level, property taxes across states lumped together, schools get money based need. 

If school needs new roof, get it. Maybe comes cost nice school, asses go sell chocolate candles liquor stores police stations like school made do. 

If rich complain, welcome world. want something schools, work city budget via bond. Whatever faults may have, Cuomo done good job handling pandemic. NYC safest large city states right thanks largely him. Wouldn’t guessed back March looking dumbasses around giving shit social distancing. 

Although think dumbasses starting get lazy again. Every time go groceries early morning run, see people without masks. go park Brooklyn evening, see people large groups chilling out, masks sight. sound like brown shirt right now. point I’m pretty sure it. fool ignore something big. spike guarantee. Maybe area got lucky large numbers cases present protests, areas get lucky. Look science, politics. Thank captain obvious :) Sadly, regardless political people like you, Abbott, Trump making COVID, apolitical.

It doesnt give shit democrat whose social distancing wearing mask, Republican ""free breathing"" fuckwit. walk shit head, Typhoid Mary, mother fucker's snot cloud, new host.

So ""good people"" going die well. 10 countries cases Florida. 28 countries cases Dade county. want functional kidneys, lungs, brain tissue, heart muscle life long. Avoid infection. Viral load. need close contact (less 6ft 10 minutes) get enough viral load get sick. Protests fundamentally promote that, since walking outdoors. WAY, SLOW DAY. MEANING CASE COUNT SURGE TOMMOROW. seem keep saying maskers avoid anti-maskers. say let's expand completely segregate society non-mask wearing non-lockdowners everyone else. I'm sure mind catastrophic deaths side since theyre big personal responsibility 'a while' understatement.

that's least 1.5 months complete lockdown another 2 months gradual opening. China might try something funny though. kind makes sense. military realistically oppose incapacitated stops invading Taiwan, Vietnam, Philippines South Korea? they're they're going now. Looking 1 week moving average John's Hopkins Data.

Plus deaths lag behind new cases 2 3 weeks. They're good indicator. Outside lake sunny day 7 people low risk don’t feel like dumb fully captures essence Dan “Throw Grandma Volcano Appease Economy” Patrick. says Congress right control interstate commerce. President, governor, bill street. 

We get ignore founding documents laws country convenient. Bullshit. Multiple mayors come recently since admitted protests played role. much protests contribute spread still questionable. 

Anyone believes protests didn’t play role naive hell. one wants talk cause criticizing sacrosanct movement like “black lives matter” big no. Unpopular opinion: 90% paying degree, 90% learn us curriculum. Yeah, gonna bad time went college frats parties, comes education still getting 99% paid for. “libs” read Harry Potter apparently... read different book joke nothing political affiliations. ""You'll love seeing smile mortician cleans up"" that's response I'd give point. I'm fucking done entitled people. I'm waiting snap mask free idiot problem! know practical definitions word “know.”

No, need assume worst case.  need accurate possible, prepare cases weights toward probability Who’s going enforce this? City workers waiting NYC airports take info? Airlines aren’t going take on. 
My mom shocked couple weeks ago talk Floridians need self quarantine one seemed care there. Got plane climbed cab. (She self quarantined tested negative traveling). I’m happy she’s staying New York coming back Florida while. Trump President United States built skyscrapers former career. downvotes tho lol   found documentary crazy guy country it(Belgium) felt fucking ashamed it.

How Americans deal types incredible me. Thus, outdoors mask virus’s kryptonite point start using trucks disinfect streets. family state panic right now. Driving towards wall odor (DeSantis) wheel. Though pretty good news me, fat person. Eh... already knew cases much antibody response, do. guessing anyone reinfected 6-8 weeks later 'little antibody"" response group.

My guess cases give level immunity, fades point. However, immunity/cross protection better none, would hopefully allow avoid severe case.

And keep mind there's lot talk immunological dark matter, people less susceptible others could change things lot.

I definitely see scenarios partially effective vaccine preventative treatment along sort immunity virus slows process greatly allows us return normalcy. still ways though. Early 2021 would best case IMO.  exactly voted Governor Polis. smart man never talked anything willing walk for! completely misled, obviously person lower rung life, posts 100% useless waste time. altruism. insight. humility. give fuck yourself.

My username PBateman guys wanna go shoot people together. That’s accurate. Medicaid assigned income citizens would lead believe statement true we’d seeing everyone who’s income low enough receive Medicaid worse outcomes. fact matter among Medicaid recipients contract covid19 people color 2 3 times likely negative outcome. financial situations, medical coverage, race determines likelihood die. Bear attacks contagious.

Bear attacks contagious. friend getting attacked bear, socially distance...very distanced, also likely get attacked bear. can’t get attacked bear simply around somebody else attacked bear. 

No,but get attacked bear simply around bear attacked someone else. Coronavirus different thing.

We agree. Coronavirus much smaller deadly bears. also spelled c-o-r-o-n-a-v-i-r-u-s bears spell b-e-a-r-s. know, read comment you. one replying to. part reacted way did.

But look rest country. look behaved first ""lockdown"" even call that. I'm state sort locked sort not, plenty places open whole time even breakout gone, opened way back up.

So way see it, may well call ""permanent lockdown,"" don't, idiots know better make significant minority country idiots know better allow ruled what's going around completely ignore it. people, can't understand slightest bit nuance, may well blunt - ending ANYTIME SOON.

For many people addicted instant gratification, can't see past next week, much less next month next year, scrape paycheck paycheck - may well ""permanent.""

Because society, seem completely lost sense object permanence case. sight, may well mind. constantly hammered home thing still us dangerous always been, might well go bar hair dresser back school.

Yeah. Make permanent. grow enough recognize difference permanent large number months small number years, change minds. given past months, ZERO faith average fellow American even capable that. Goalposts school LA county private, unfortunately Like bitchin' keytars? necessarily dumb. restricted within-state travel 14 days, would probably stop virus' spread tracks even better halting between-state travel. However, people might starve, etc., could problem. also thing really hard leave countries eastern part Europe. think called metal draperies something like that.

People also feared weapon existed war, one could destroy city almost warning. believe called gadget. always say...

He’s telling like is. That’s true. experience people put people danger, apologize come crass put whole state danger well. say that? actually kinda is. He’s live stream interviews lately; listened podcast called Podcast-19 FiveThirtyEight on. It’d good big news corp gave bit though Sorry keep posting this, say economy, nationwide mask requirement could save everyone $3000 preventing $1 trillion hit US GDP. best way save jobs, money economy masks, testing contact tracing smart science-based reopening Theres population problem. much rather hard truth people dumping metric fuck tons sugar shit sandwich situation.

r/brandnewsentence  Texas Abbott too! Look partner crime Ted Cruz wear mask airport airplane, still think they're law! Let's get all!

Edited autocorrect. Yea sucks. dad even religious thinks Fauci full shit. Crazy. read entire article, it’s largely opinion piece. claims made CDC fudging numbers, mechanics death certificates drafted, rest article theorizing says COVID statistics. former impossible research outside opinion pieces latter reason doubt factually accurate. 

“Right wrong, something seems pretty weird this.”

What mean? seems weird this? Can't put people ICU room ICU. mean... New York still suffered far, far worse Florida did. Maybe Florida surpass overall deaths per capita point, July 13, likelihood died covid significantly higher NY Florida.

This isnt endorsement/criticism either politician, btw. commenting state gone point. Thank advice!! definitely appreciated. lot also whether want go marine science herpetology, I've really leaning late, especially go grad school. That's whole nother story haha 

Unfortunately know much what's going Hatteras. lot work Beaufort current internship based Provincetown I'm bit loop outer banks, although know great coastal studies center Manteo. Yes know make ignorant comment. New York cases deaths anywhere country. took month mandate masks. positive patients nursing facilities.

They control way praised. think bit dramatic? permanent lockdown? Why? 

We need get numbers control keep control vaccine and/or better treatment available. changes need implemented daily life, course. permanent lockdown? 

Why would still need locked decade now? first pandemic hit world people managed recover without ""permanent lockdown"" past. also know think society going unrecognizable this. 

Like, be. things change - should. highly doubt concerts movies sports permanently. They're already back certain parts world actually virus control.

EDIT: clear, lock shit numbers low enough actually safe out. ""permanent"" lockdown absurd, unless mean ""indefinite"" lockdown get shit control.

EDIT 2: want point early stages this. HIV essentially death sentence 30 years ago, today there's pill take avoid getting entirely mention treatments minimize symptoms progression. 

*Right now*, good treatment COVID. That's remain... eventually figure shit out. might soon, like forever. Whether there's effective vaccine better treatment options lower mortality severity, something eventually developed. 

Could years future? Yeah, could be. even ""permanent"". People going quarantined forever. FWIW, neither [Kåre Mølbak [Frode Forland thinks they'll second wave.

The disease suppressed mostly contact tracing isolation long enough infected keep up. There's great stats page Norway (in Norwegian, lot guessable). Bars amusement parks opened June 1, gatherings 200 people allowed since June 15, compared 50 Sweden. TLDR: TLDR: COVID exists. Vaccine difficult create. 

Need human tests subject (especially health workers)

Need animal tests subject government dropped ball hard sure, hundreds thousands selfish, stupid people guilty. masks necessary sterilization prevent disease? stronger associations N95 similar respirators compared disposable surgical masks similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks

But I’m really grateful guy. Everyone talking him, one talking pleas hospital admin, adding 3,000 plus medical staff help failing hospitals nothing stem flow patients headed way.

Nor anyone notice nursing home staff residents test positive amazingly low rate soon I’ll mixing 200,000 biweekly tests rest states tests artificially drive percent positive.

Definitely another victory lap day. Wait yesterday day problem. Opening schools fine right?

Now see people governs call Death Sentence DeSantis People want economy stay open. constituents. type thinking removes chance debate. obvious way thinking damaging his. words, hypothesis Italy's outbreak 2nd widespread outbreak country first understandably mostly undetected. 

Couldn't hypothesis used explain COVID mysteries? instance, unexplainable bad outcomes people predisposed general? Large numbers asymptomatic carriers even pre existing conditions? 

I read interesting article beginning pandemic already hypothesized something similar. aforementioned article discussed alternative theory 1918 Spanish flu's 2nd wave severity. Popular consensus mutated. theory article 2nd wave actually worse due ADE. basis hypothesis viruses generally mutate become fatal due natural selection. i.e second wave severe due immunological effects ADE. authors also pointed ADE would explain strange occurrence 1918 much deadly young adults whose immune systems strongest produce robust cytokine type responses. always ask Nintendo medical advice must sound prediction. guns going do?

Covid-19: *If insist.* push, i’ll share something learned local community college recently - extra helpful loan applications bc covid, also giving loaner laptops subsidizing internet service. maybe look it? take class. lot fairly recent textbooks. one need, i’ll send free. maybe little helps get even one class people 55, compare mortality rate covid-19 flu. teachers strike teachers go back unsafe conditions. reason SAR governments separately responsible pandemic prevention, central government get say (at least yet, one imagine goes disastrous SAR ask help central government intervene).

Or alternatively think way: pandemic prevention measures deployed Beijing applied Hong Kong moment, Hong Kong municipal government subservient central government districts would already locked now.

Given difference makes sense measure separately. Sounds good. consistent words actions. important. know didn't. would expect k-12, resources, get. success still depends upon attaching best brightest around world post secondary education. bummed that's all. much better.

Oh believe it. Great, kick Texans visiting Colorado. Let's honest gonna maybe 2021 reopening looks it. get downvoted hell, think Disney World open enormous embarrassment country. 
 
That said, actually think great idea. Florida hot, Disney World stressful. place socially distance outside take mask really nice retreat. 
 
I say coming helping friends mine move first house, yesterday. 4 us friends wore masks loaded moving truck 2 hours 70 degree heat. drove new place unloaded everything. able spread shaded back yard take masks off, wonderful. Like 5 mph breeze shade sweaty tired, felt really nice. 
 
I think Disney never opened up, also certain one follow rules COVID-19 Incubation qnd propagation zone. people socially distance, take precautions aware actions effect people, would welcomed addition.  docs give SSRIs 

be careful shit protestors lock downs quarantines aren’t? Stop hypocrisy. tens thousands people blocks it’s problem! Want place work open doesn’t go get laid off? Ahh you’re selfish bastard. Don’t want forced state wear mask? specifically makes selfish bastard. 

It’s obvious following order entirely okay promoted others treated like “selfish bastards”. isn’t even news anymore it’s part everyday life people allowed follow quarantine others evil it. It’s asinine.


When going realize wearing mask much protest anything else? want protest go right ahead want defend people protesting that’s right don’t fucking hypocrite pretend there’s one sided high horse “bastards” start stop people wanting forced government wear masks.

Coronavirus Forever After

Coronavirus II: Idiot's Pride

Dawn Coronavirus I’ve never life heard someone STEM/CS major say college magical. wish college relaxing fun makes be. Cleveland “The Jesus Town”? That’s new one me. I’ve 45 years. certainly enough churches Christian schools colleges here, that’s sure. years ago also held annual Church God Prophecy conference, thankfully moved larger city. think real unique, eh? sever emphysema, pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, COPD, wear mask too.

We must miracles. Granted, I'm 34 issues, 70. believe China's numbers 😅 using evil people compare Newsom? I'm saying he's evil, I'm saying fucked up. Stop mindlessly praising him. There's room debate here.

Nothing I'm saying radical. Nothing I'm saying talks displeasure local government. I'm leapfrogging anyone angry Gavin Newsom responded -- there's room angry levels government let country state get sorry state in. 

Learn productive discourse ain't chief. We're probably liberal people, especially defending Gavin Newsom, I'd hate see react people even farther away political spectrum.

Newsom watched us fuck up? somehow that's what, *my* fault? (a) Gavin newsoms fault divesting power rather using good (b) local government fucking much? shred brain power, humility, empathy, understanding? Get head ass. think term ""wave"", meaning like country country doesnt make sense. live Massachusetts things good last month so. look curve infections/deaths MA, clearly went wave March mid June cases stable recently deaths hospitalizations continuing decrease day... there's reason say anything like Florida Texas right took time opened gradually kept eye numbers/followed statistics epidemiologists governor Michigan made masks requirement today people STILL it. Poop rainbow lousy commercial slogsn Worried special education. could get lots money bloated military budget maybe stop interjecting trillions endless wars
Or something?!! Makes much sense. Looking Hong Kong make depressed. Doesn’t matter well do, take little break, slowly start school, let people indoor dining bit, bam, community outbreak. name calling coming 9 year old charge.

What expect someone knows Fauci WAAAAAAAYYYYY smarter him.  ted cruz probably took 30 seconds check Newsom write single tweet yesterday. retweeted one tweet yesterday reminding people wear mask. It’s sad writing completely false comment couldn’t take 30seconds day double check thinking. mean typing comment would taken longer fact check. Biggest problem body cooperating lol. I’ve following parks closely. began planning great 3 week camping trip Yellowstone glacier last summer take place month. Even got amazing camp site Many Glacier. held hope long possible cancelled trip June. really looking forward Glacier. Closing East side park made decision cancel trip much easier. end wasn’t worth risks family hurdles would involved. harms exercising probably harms aren't, less noticeably.

Wearing mask makes feel bad. you? tried putting hot sauce it? leave. unemployment raise even GDP collapse. reasons president (Democrat republican) attacked corporations. governors parties give sweetheart deals. losing major economic disaster. worst thing add second economic disaster first. Yeah shit. 

The supposed genius spouting obvious commonsense. bar become low. never said would next year, could well year. time arrived shores NZ warning watching Italy. 

Unfortunately politicians warning. Construction great idea pandemic job. Mostly outdoors spend plenty time isolated others. would look get back chef pandemic over. since we’re silly victims according you, change actually come about? wait right thing? don’t try influence people vote favor interests? sit back allow enable jerks destroy county, hoard money control every thing? orange county though.

&amp;#x200B;

They considered none that. Remindme! 4 months  Yo get Trump sucks, straightup bullshit somebody reddit made 100 upvotes. 

We literally know rich/broke Trump never released tax returns.  Give week. Houston’s morgue already overflowing, coroner request FEMA mobile morgue. Two weeks outside. 

Abbot rock hard place. needs placate base, shifting demographics mean seat could play next time term up. Google tell us. Good luck! Wait till millions kids get Covid19 school give Grandma grandma dies. Trump lose Texas Georgia maybe Kentucky! say double digit electoral college votes?

Everyone vote want see Trump lose 10,000,000 votes. Let's make sure lose, biggest loser loudly fired. rented car get Brooklyn Schenectady. Florida plates. felt ashamed. American intentionally coughs essential worker welded house. Theyre 21st century-illiterate, say information illiterate. pearl harbor happened month ago, would penetrate consciousness would tepid panda express boycott.

Edit: design, makes easier separate pocket money. got COVID I’d still wear mask recovering one reasons model behaviors others. can’t wait go visit beaches blows over. I'm sure dont know whole truth.

That's sure, since nobody really yet. never basically shut entire world making vaccine number 1 priority scientists doctors across global. Plus first thing tested vaccine creation safe not. Cure vaccine synonymous . Vaccine prophylactic measure meant prevent lesson infection. cure means completely eliminate infection symptoms. thing . honest , speak politics early stage, much better. course fault.

I might people knowing going here, fact US needs shutdown, lack action, afraid economy breaks down. wise, people die, pandemic grow, economy break anyway. Better short, sharp shock ... location services turned ""on"" phone? Ah yes, wonder NY occasionally updates unconfirmed deaths, announces ""keeping score."" So, yeah say make sense--as accumulation recent unconfirmed deaths. appear so, currently option Europe looks it. Lol, r/MaskSkepticism droplets lose transmission vector (droplets) quickly evaporative heating. High heat, low humidity droplets dry seconds. Sad see getting downvoted. NYT analysis excess deaths also shows Florida undercounting. Texas Arizona however are. states true death toll 40-50 % higher official number. again, FL case, least according New York Times. official numbers check compared excess deaths. idea FL hiding lots deaths myth. comparison excess deaths would reveal that, matter Makes sound like died masks, already neighbors believe happen. I’d like see insiders refer president. They're real life r/MaskSkepticism posters. real life Dolores Umbridge. consider giving avocado toast? funny thing is, even Plus pretty sure, 16 countries outrank US freedom socialised healthcare. old alt-right uses justify opposition mask use. Damn, r/MaskSkepticism sad. can’t attribute dumb. Everyone knows wash hands cover mouth cough/sneeze that’s virus transferred. 100% selfish wanting get attention “rebelling” see many Asian people wearing masks certain situations “normal” times, community individual mindset. county, low income Latino neighborhood 78% cases from. mostly work essential jobs live crowded conditions. 

Other counties might problem, too. members certain political party. problem! I’m optometrist patient refused see said couldn’t due ADA. didn’t know time, I’m glad know now. helps know ADA along company, board backing complains me.  good example can't everything pre-covid masks on. 

Some activities can't happen. Group fitness classes (whether gym school) probably happen anymore. Masks saving anyone. China built entirely hospital cope Wuhan. America denies thing tells people wear masks spend money. r/MaskSkepticism gonna post like proves one wear mask. Looks like we're gonna top 465 today. I'll shocked get 1000's tomorrow Wednesday.

even little brother said something anti vaxxers going fuck like back april

they shame. actually punishments fines might actally get thru them. otherwise maybe deaths might show light people close start keeling they(Fauci/CDC) trust us enough say make one, wear bandana, wrap shirt around tour face? sounds like would've prevented many people dying stopping spread homemade masks early on. Outward Bound programs like step here. would gangbusters business students want take gap year mostly outside you’re scared, stay home. I’m scared, go out.

You can’t make put anything body invade space.

And mask works, care mine? Isn’t job? made original claim. Burden proof falls you. Common sense. upside is, you’re alive hear fucking downside! Personally, think Wolf Levine crack season. agree? Thank you. states also testing people symptoms NorthEast state outbreak. outdoor gatherings okay. experts attacking anybody going beach sounds amazingly cheap tuition. Actually lockdowns part successful, almost everywhere saw steady declines spread. issue reckless re-opening complete failure government organize testing tracing, enforcing mitigation measures like distancing masks. Contact tracing works infrastructure it, enough tracers follow leads.

The lockdown meant reduce spread manageable level, contact tracing could effective, places re-opened could safely following proper mitigation measures. real failure public broadly didnt take seriously ignored restrictions. 

Basically every country world went lockdown, countries followed strict measures KEEP levels low. US george bush moment, unravelling ‘mission accomplished’ banner acted like everything back normal. live Ohio got two big packages face masks office 12 people bureau workers' Comp, probably ended 100 masks Ah yes, calling people selfish bastards great way change minds, certainly cause ingrain views even further, right? Trump turns he'll contention general. No, effective hard solution lockdown. issue level self service independence got us GDP now. Bleach shots /s close till Business owner here, actually variety business last decade some, areas would suffer tremendously shutdowns. say correct macroeconomic level, iron detail, unfortunately (and much traction lockdowns comes from) reality looks quite different.

First all, almost shutdowns done kind relief financial compensation place. People asked shut stream income, still pay rent (for everything - restaurant rent usually insane) often times least partial wages, trust government (yeah, right) get sort compensation. many countries came late, small, all. Trust government low USA (and many places right-wing populists especially), naturally people dont give up.

Second, businesses significant savings. Reasons different, large financial system HEAVILY disincentivizing savings. built world want everyone reinvest every dollar. bites us ass. every week every month even reduced income allows measures cut costs, save money, something it. People want agency lives, jobs. natural try minimize time feeling helpless minimum.

Third, recovering economy help went under. lot businesses, shutdown forseeably end. every day keep open sell stock, otherwise recoup investment, save money day after.

And, last least, consider individual perspective: given choice 1% chance death (not accurate people think chance dying covid-19) save career business, vs. chance dying (which also true) certain ruin, ton people would prefer gamble, especially feel certain people carry burden, whereas many professions jobs largely unaffected benefit lock down.

I honestly favor whatever measures need taken, stupidity ignorance alone drives demands. card Chip phone ping credit card readers require still physically input passcodes confirm button effectively ruining point mention amount anti vaxxers right now. swear people becoming anti vaxxers misinformation Seems word lately catch survive it, got antibodies. recent source immunity?

Try NYU Archive link: regions tell Ivo general assessments made beginning pandemic, stated elderly primarily cared home nursing homes taken hospital even need hospital care. 


#""The fact general rules care elderly makes cold,"" says Professor Ingmar Skoog, elderly researcher University Gothenburg.


At early stage pandemic, several regions issued instructions make general care assessments, something Ivo believes may behind fact elderly assessed individually many cases bad experiences. 

When Ivo makes major examination country's elderly housing, elderly's right care needed, three regions: Region Stockholm, Västra Götaland Kronoberg responded Ivo beginning pandemic, priorities set general assessments elderly housing elderly. care would provided accommodation even need hospital care. 

- serious possible implement guidelines. we've heard could re-examined fairly quickly, says Anna-Karin Nyqvist, Head Unit Ivo's Mitt department.

In guidelines several regions, including Stockholm region, stipulated care elderly provided special housing greatest extent possible. 

Ivo, conducts comprehensive review elderly care , states observations regions' priorities regions beginning pandemic carried general assessments elderly cared hospitals, despite need hospital care, without staying homes care there. mentioned general terms Ivo's presentation presented Tuesday morning, several allegations DN, press service announces email three regions replied restrictions.

Ingmar Skoog, professor director Center Aging University Gothenburg, says Ivo's reports general rules care elderly ""very nasty thing"": 

- interesting Ivo states places general rules one make individual assessments - makes really cold, shows media written about, relatives testified right, says Ingmar Skoog continues: 

- **A general assessment basically means medical assessment made. emerged pandemic gone far much chronological age, biological age must determine**, says Skoog. 

According regions' response Ivo , reason treatment limitations stated uncertainty pandemic would burden care infection reached region risk care would overloaded. couple regions stated care capacity expanded care fallen ill covid-19, need guidelines making priorities decreased. According interviewees, general assessments made today care needs level care, Ivo states. 

According response Västra Götaland region Ivo, difficult beginning pandemic give elderly equal care, therefore elderly ""probably"" receive individual assessment. Eventually, individual care plans developed, according health medical care director Ann Söderström.

- Individual assessments made case illness gradually individual care plans developed others. guidelines priorities primarily concerned intensive care. time, hospital care always best elderly person many illnesses, says Ann Söderström. 

- individual assessment must made together patient relatives.

At time, many 40 per cent interviewed 40 worst affected municipalities state limited opportunities obtain individual assessment treatment linked covid-19 special housing. 

- find behind numbers. special accommodation [care home] is, all, private residence - **those live right medical assessment everyone else**, says Ingmar Skoog.

- start requesting medical records municipalities, also primary care, doctor individual assessment, says. 

What consequences may treatment individual elderly people when, example, transferred hospitals, Ivo's continued review hopefully able answer, says. 

- consequences elderly, think something able see review journals, says Nyqvist.

MA, see well 90%+ people wearing masks outside. believe not, one time total since May walked Dunkin Donuts seen someone without mask (but came quickly grab order since ordered mobile left quickly FWIW). Besides that, every person I've seen every store, shopping center cafe I've worn mask. one makes fuss it, everyone supportive other. walking, even masks on, people wave smile walk by, nice see same. feels like everyone accepted ""routine"" around seems keeping numbers down, even begin Phase 3 past protests, July 4th weekend, etc.  We're living one times future time travelers want visit. city (Lyon, France), masks public transportation enforced inspectors police, penalty 135€ fine.

Sweet. means infected show symptoms. 

That change pool people potential become infected.  

 could call 'natually immune.

I'd prefer call infected carriers virus potential spread others.  #ronadesantis US, stem degrees high demand. family members getting 100k+ offers pandemic. People may forced take pay cuts one taking less money keep job stem degree. Totally untrue Texan finishing degree- done state (and if) graduate. Thinking people, much older me, who’ve gotten am, mercy dumb ass kids (and parents’ ideologies), breaks god damn heart. Sincerely hoping achieve support DESERVE- because, all, it’s fucking fault virus didn’t go away. Yes, skills valuable certain places allow go there. mention need ""ace"" quiz entry, also query skills. skills might ones expect make sure ask want go...

For Europe even fixed skill list (Only benefits added certain skills) example need get blue card:

They easier access labour market produce binding job offer gross annual salary least 53,600 euros (2019). skilled workers fields mathematics, IT, natural sciences engineering well doctors, threshold set 41,808 euros (2019).\[...\]

And exceptions dont even need price break, allow even ""easy get positions"" there.

Disclaimer: hold ""good"" passport (downgraded rank #3) makes good bit easier, consider skill set fairly location independent.

Edit2: EU also allows free choice workplace within borders... visa needed there. Saline, one people attended reason Gallup Park Argo park closed. Wow 2020 investigation wearing damn mask 🤦‍♂️ understand store something one around like come really ! ask random Canadians, ask CIC (Immigration Citizenship). family close friends Canada willing help, go MP's constituency office they're trouble navigating all. know applies immigration countries need visas, maybe that's overkill, calling MP's office pretty low-risk like end blacklisted friend called MP asking help American move Canada. lie anything change story actually stay file. say moving take care sick aunt, better real aunt. 

I highly doubt we'll ever accept refugees US, mostly one criteria whether relocation within country solves problem (i.e.: fleeing incompetent psychopath governor state trying give everyone 'rona, move different state solve problem). Accepting refugee US would basically like Justin Trudeau holding press conference declare US failed state. actually alarm something similar month back Kiwi said lowering numbers hold (it back dropping 60 50 40 per day several consecutive weeks) 4 weeks reports would week estimated 60 going 75 week estimated 40 also going towards 70s. asked reminded 4 weeks guess what. week 64 turned 64. week 51 remained 51. ex &amp; arguing numbers. believe problem trying figure numbers coming from. say x number cases hospital admissions tests? Also case number death numbers higher, lower same? Exactly, beginning US sucked testing, read reddit, seemingly still do. least understandable, given widespread virus is. Sweden literally changing law thing Denmark work lol great public shaming. Source. Mb resident roscoe yesterday several bars restaurant jam packed people moving around tables talking loudly. little Corvid mist everyone. Dude, ever consider that’s it’s illegal smoke public places US now? Reduced deaths reduction traffic reduction non-covid 19 communicable diseases higher extra deaths due closed hospitals current rates.

It could change current spike spirals completly control. too. Lol assumed people wore inside, know better since I've seen told let building. Glad keep door locked allow time.

Spoiler Alert: we're longer midst raging pandemic soaring infections 25% world's deaths. 

And science-backed federal guidelines prioritizing safety schools follow.

Right now, they're saying ""gotta open! Economy! Economy!"", means fuck people risk lives lives everyone love. Wait. Come January 21st gets join rest world get Covid-19 test every day people around get tested.

And since January, he'll go Mar-a-Lago, NYC. wonder coronavirus situation going Florida then. vaccine doesn’t “equip” immune system anything. triggers response immune system immune system designed do. you’ve already virus body’s immune system successfully fought infection, would vaccine anything differently? point receiving vaccine would immunity disease. question still stands, there’s immunity disease would point vaccine? can't unsee this.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  cases per deaths ratio NY’s peak. think treatments testing playing role idk actual impact. surges places like Florida Texas deniers first place already accounting practice question much impact well.

At rate look death rate whatever may relation testing case rates still imagine correlation similar pattern cases going 30 50% week current testing conditions. Doubling every 2-3 weeks. 

We’re starting see deaths begin spike past week pattern new cases begun rise 4 weeks ago nationally Florida. things equal deaths 2000 day nationally 3-4 weeks damage already done.

It’s new frontier judge severity effects individual actions. Cases clearly rise stagnant time. Summer, reopening, Memorial Day, July 4th it’s catching up. next weeks see deaths continue rise not. That’ll proof need.

It’s invasive test people aren’t getting risking going hospital settings don’t too. people paranoid little extra cautious people rushing get tested because. cases rise they’re rationing tests well. 1000% tax pot would drop ocean terms revenue lost everywhere else. Legal marijuana going save us. Ppl like south too. took friend drop car walked mask like snickered him. one wearing one, like last week hate attitude, nothing prior COVID seems ""fun"" was. state reopened within last month, going anywhere proven rewarding enjoyable... sucks, reality. bad news california lot buisness owners going go belly lot people work restaurants wont able put food table.

Looked far sanitary place notable among results medical vulnerability stood 16.1% 6,741 non-smokers, versus 31.5% full sample 8,405 young adults, included smokers.

So.. among young people smoke (almost 20 percent, according article), almost 1 3 classified 'medically vulnerable,' meaning increased risk - seem quantified - requiring hospitalization get Covid.

Jeez, mean, I'm pretty much hiding bunker, headline really stretching it. Definitely intended make sound like 1/3rd young people Covid severe symptoms.

I'm definitely concerned unknown long-term impacts, think risk severe acute symptoms *that* high. making comment really dislike headline, article seems saying 1/3 young adults researchers consider might risk factor severe covid19. everybody, even sizable minority folks risk factor actually develop severe disease. whatever reason decided main prof lectures would recorded GTAs lead 4 sessions 50 min long discussion sections

Should separate Washington DC category something, too? Seems like odd decision. Idk man, shaming people wearing masks looking like waste time. lesson Trump era elites politicians gigantic influence culture. want people wear masks, stop getting arguments internet, call governor tell harshly punish people don't. ""Liberals"" gotten used powerless they've forgotten system making people things want to. People always fucking idiots, always will. That's government. freedom live life, leave home, work, eat restaurants, rely lungs oxygen.

Cases local transmission decreasing week.

Guys this, call fetus don’t feel bad murdering them. remember Black death also hit Middle east, North Africa Asia. Accepting something fact it’s labeled study (especially new study) scientific method actually works. That’s dangerous approach anything find spoken written. knee jerk reaction led W.H.O publicly announce via Tweet evidence indicating human-to-human covid transmission back January. Information always questioned analyzed. 

As study question: method valid? data valid (collected cell phones)? conclusion based correlation (which isn’t always causation)? results replicated? results valid? variables investigated? study approved review board (it wasn’t). study peer reviewed (it wasn’t). funded study? 

Quoting Abstract reading entire paper. Additionally, actual paper included disclosures as: “NBER working papers circulated discussion comment purposes. peer reviewed subject NBER board directors.” 

So yes, believe used word “narrative” appropriately.

Edit: Typo I’d like think years time able look back count damage, sure things won’t worse year’s time. Tegnell killed bare hands. Colleges universities closing this, accelerate that, trump able strip tax exemption... well... don’t surprised see 25% go next years. $600/wk 40 mill (not many collecting) $100 billion. Billionaires saw weath increase $200+ billion far pandemic.

We spent much every three months past 20 years fighting Middle East. money would better going us used kill people. Me..It saved me.

Gods, kill know. Ted almost looks human photo. likely live New York make 40k poor, generally vote party anyway. also never .1%

I referring comment said. 

But thing IFR tied age.

If disease kills 0% time 50 100% time 50, IFR?

So that's said ""Much less 0.1% *young demographics*.""

And indeed much less 0.1% chance death younger demographics.

*""What chances needing hospitalization dying get Covid, according CDC?""*

0 - 19yrs old = 0.1% hospital, 0.0016% death. 
20 - 29 = 1% hospital, 0.032% death 
30 - 39 = 3.4% hospital, 0.14% death 
40 - 49 = 4.3% hospital, 0.2% death 
50 - 59 = 8.2% hospital, 0.6% death 
60 - 69 = 11.8% hospital, 1.8% death 
70 - 79 = 16% hospital, 4.3% death 
80 - 89 = 18.4% hospital, 7.8% IFR low I've seen it, ever.

Obviously debate here. several reputable sources pegged lower.

Like [Center Evidence-Based Oxford could make simple estimation IFR 0.28%, based halving lowest boundary CFR prediction interval. However, considerable uncertainty many people disease, proportion asymptomatic (and demographics affected) means IFR likely Swine flu, IFR ended 0.02%, fivefold less lowest estimate outbreak (the lowest estimate 0.1% 1st ten weeks outbreak). Iceland, testing per capita occurred, IFR lies somewhere 0.03% account historical experience, trends data, increased number infections population largest, potential impact misclassification deaths gives presumed estimate COVID-19 IFR somewhere 0.1% 0.41%.* think different?  can't see logical conclusion worldview, perhaps fall categorization. blame critical. struggled spelling like you, I'd upset educators well. fair someone dropped ball education.  country sucks  Meh, real sheltering place 3 months now.

My answer: don’t fucking know yet. hard understand?

You ask „HOW VACCINE WORK“, didn’t answer. answer question? Bingo, ask it. asked IF, HOW. 

Just read question slow carefully you’ll see question unprecise. 

Look downvotes btw... hope cave time though.

He one acting, show numbers weeks' time. Which, suppose, entirely morally acceptable long gambling status quo increase likelihood status quo succeeding. investigation mean absolutely nothing happen, sure, believe it. mean it’s still worse densely populated countries done last 7 days. US recorded 435,000 cases last 7 days; Peru, ranks 4th terms highest *total* cases recorded 330,123 *since pandemic began*. 

In words, US recorded cases *in last 7 days* Peru, Chile, Mexico, Spain, UK, South Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Italy etc. recorded **ever**. 

435,000 people. That’s similar population entirety Minneapolis. could possibly realise he's joking State law still requires masks indoors anywhere else social distancing possible. OCBOE still bound state law... Interesting, think research showed vast majority cases dangerous regular flu though. lockdown needed... Fire away foreign friend. I'm open wife coming around well. loves job getting real tired low education healthcare country means future here. assaulted passenger drag plane

an *asian* doctor. presbyterian ohio, might picked another person drag plane. 

just thought. true February it’s still true now. Gonna need source one tests inaccurate sometimes unavailable don’t know people relapsing reinforcing seem leaning toward relapsing.  Colorado fierce independent streak culture. put onus local municipalities decide decrees regard masks. hard put blame one governor enacting statewide requirements 48 others not. Especially Colorado dealing outbreaks magnitude state going through. use miles first though. boycott No, sounds like things already pretty bad became issue, things even true. I've seen plenty times ""medical care"" said instead ""intensive care"", something elderly noted respond badly to, I'm highly sceptical claims related that. agree. reason herd immunity horrible strategy calling strategy flattery deserve.

But Spain able reduce number cases herd immunity kicked in, mean Florida get without trying. None supports original argument US may lose nukes loss trust.  Obviously trust important allies that’s different topic raised. Even US became isolated, nukes stay. American ban flying.

This immediately raise ire whackos, fine. instill confidence rest us. take look ""the rest us"" poll find strong masks one 80-20 arguments requiring masks puts 80 camp.

This no-brainer. People looking reasons fly, why, business flies, would ever give reason get planes. 

I'd willing bet 20% militantly anti-mask, few, fly anyway. seems like no-risk situation take stand.

But, 2.5M+ mile AA customer I've seen shoot foot over, I'll hold back placing bets. great again. I'm thinking killing myself. Deaths neatly increase line population, population density acts multiplier. Scotland one city region population one million, England least four plenty figure, one city twice population whole Scotland. need learn sir, fuck whole world act defiant it! Increased efficacy increasing shareholder wealth... Deep Apple doesnt fall far tree say ;) country issuing studies indicating children go back school wear masks parents &amp; teachers won’t get COVID19 contradicting every turn mate.

I'm glad selfless individual. signed daughter Virtual academy State K12 connect. Local home town teachers trained well teach virtually. open schools probably stay open long covid rampantly whelming teachers students. schools close students get even behind. daughter asthma risk health sending schools may prepared pandemic. fall behind us choosing virtual school her. lol. that's one actually lives Manitoba. rest Canada pretends humans living scare people. Yep. Boyfriend took test last Monday, word back yet. Face masks house new normal. teaching actually. Look number new infections day. Hospitals filled Arizona Florida. company acted horrendously back march, instead taking precaution squashed rumors ""oh someone office went visit grandma nursing home *may* *may not* effected"" feeling well stay home ... next say similar meeting (?) girl meeting said feeling well... okay ... following week start working home (finally) found said female makes Facebook post bed ridden infected disease. may already knowing it!  would survived corona free scenario collateral damage never understood part movie kid. still don't. reads like opinion piece last SC case, 1999, seemed uphold constitutional guarantee freedom movement among states.

Also, speaking federal government's ability right limit interstate travel, rather right state's governor limit movement. illiterate? boss sent [this everyone morning evidence need worry COVID-19 safe come back work office. Help links sites tell simple facts dispute hoax claims. depends shutdown ""real"" not. AFAIK, UK ban people going outside homes right? China did, groceries delivered government 3 weeks. People allowed exit residential complex. armed guards posted gates residential complex.

China ""real"" shutdown. UK not.

The virus dormant 2 weeks, 3 weeks enough find quarantine infected persons. infected can't spread period since everything shutdown can't exit home.

This works much spread yet. # death greatly reduced everyone wear masks follow social distance. people like make impossible happen. think there’s portion irony OP. wondering, Sweden’s population around ten million. take education seriously. 

Example: public school system bunch 1 room school houses dotting country unconnected. one businessmen realized could make money schooling stitched one room school houses together without plan beyond ""make money"".

we also put personal issues schooling. 

Example: California went best schools country bottom list single generation. How? law passed change property taxes applied schooling. Originally property taxes went big pot CA public schools got equal slice proportional slice based student population. new law made property taxes applied specific school district. paper sounds fair right; money going local school? practice CA diverse makeup, super wealthy/affluent communities drastically poor communties, translated communities stellar schools communities worst schools country exact state. people state want funding neighbors education. well congrats, neighbors moron!

If soures would share information retained school save materials teacher gave unit. inevitable outbreak due protests, can’t plan multiple massive super-spreader events expect consequences. 

Also use lotion see doctor you’re still jacking widespread death panic. Fucking ghoul. everyone needs go business. wear mask want feel need.  What's investigate? like there's going consequences.

It's another example elites politicians giving shit knowing matter bc nothing happen anyway. large unhealthy corporations receive bailouts thousands mom pops go business? agree poster said bailouts. fair equitable system let businesses can't hack fail. Large small. strong survive. economic darwinism will. little entrance paper got said 7-10 days. Phone call positive, mail results. I'll update actually get it. try blow candle also good test vast majority Manitoba uninhabited. point you’re trying make, grouse? Follow $$$$.....you, kids, grandkids lives sale ""the investigation"" about? either wore one didn't. investigate? nations... wish could claim asylum New Zealand 

LET INNNNN think talking shit France's employment virus response 40 million unemployed Americans completely incompetent federal response. true big problem.  like people something stupid put people's lives deadly danger live Pennsylvania one remaining states teachers still strike. seems like damn good reason one push hard enough. Mods reading posts correctly translated. honestly can't believe prioritize sticking Google translation conveying accurate information. Feels like blatant rule break deliberately post low quality information you, according yourself, ability moms teacher fear family's life schools open again. bad enough adults world, expecting kids follow guidelines naive. Tbh, one board anti maskers. One county supervisors member one duo supervisors excused restaurants enforcing indoor dining closure April.... knew way going. Another follows footsteps DeVos, so, again, surprise. 

But resident, I'm furious this. irresponsible completely unworkable regard safety teachers, staff, immunocompromised students. wonder OC governor's shit list right now. miles, use American? would essentially flying free putting ""burden"" without actually paying them... flying partner airline passing burden onto someone else? Seems like makes sense use miles start flying elsewhere.

Unless enough miles actual free flights, probably things spend miles still get value cost airline money. It’s okay though. self-selecting gene pool. rational people wear masks maybe won’t get infected choosing enrich rest us walking steadfastly towards completely avoidable demise. read story people like mother literally worse animals. Daft? British? Yeah let’s make fun semantics it’s thousands needlessly died Swedish style... thinking enrolling child small private school following CDC guidelines going beyond them. went school VPK, weeks summer camp. cost $12,000 year, don’t trust public school system. still doubts, need go back work, terrible remote learning. uncertainty frustrating. someone voted Trump, agree. President 1000% cause mistrust wearing masks cracked enforced mask wearing short while, we'd fine now. 404 error need airlines. 4 major ones left US reducing competition would serve make service worse can't take business elsewhere. bailouts come conditions course, government also acquire stake large company accepting bailout. sure sleeping car safer, things considered, State law requires mask indoors see authority permitting OC Board Eductation override state law reads theatre me. cant allow absence masks anymore could permit cigarette smoking schools IMO, G0P signalling base. Huh? 20 states mask mandates. Agreed relatively low case counts right we've seen quickly change. give example action done Texas? “Right work” means cannot forced join union condition employment (though may choose wish). “At employment” may you’re thinking of, also correct case. 

Texas (specifically Texas, states like Texas) prohibits public school teachers striking law quite level didn’t ever think hoax, cousin taking seriously all, going bars hanging large groups. got covid began lecture people serious scary people need aware it. love receiving text message. *Surprised pikachu face* people seen, Ted Cruz certainly one them. $170 cancelled AA flight April spend end next year.. yeah I'm good. fought give fucking refund point cocksucking crooks keep it. Everyone power strike. Roman plebs would simply walk Rome ancient times, bringing halt. knee jerk reaction many counties California making correct decision. first state shut down, populous counties already said person classes without order state. Orange County dangerous mix rich entitled people like painting victim-turned-hero. Seriously, watching grandfather, many uncles father age trades convinced NEVER go route. College way, go cheap state school set. (And community college first make even cheaper, wish hindsight). Oh. Shit. Forgot part. dad co-sign private loan. least federal loans would gone! Yes. Fucking yes, police waiting gate people done that. Federal Aviation Regulations 91.11, 121.580 135.120 state ""no person may assault, threaten, intimidate, interfere crewmember performance crewmember's duties aboard aircraft operated."". would violation federal law.  everyone looks excuse hate Disney. I'm start looking intoy journey man Tool &amp; Die card. machinist 10 years body far wrecked. ""under investigation"", investigation what? There's video proof wearing mask. Either action nothing pretend responsible. Could always play patriotism card. Americans willingly sending children die resource wars less. Play propaganda right, stress danger virus, stress people's patriotic duty, charge people breaking quarantine provide free food, essentials, medical care people true lockdown like China did, people would complied. life insurance policies paid six months pay out, two years. clearly offer quite bit spreading C'mon, Ted! Except Russia, India Brazil. So, countries. much love public school always support public school system kids goin 8th 10th grade, gonna sit grand experiment out.  specific passenger wouldnt get way emergency surgery appointment something well. Vulnerable people frontline workers would get us MASSIVE proportion way there. acknowledged real. Absolutely hard hit areas would wait months — chances good close schools due infections regroup.

It gets trickier relatively safe states, still think staying best option. fact distancing hybrid attempted reduced budget insane. you’re seeing people state come NY work couple years, move city. Native New Yorkers didn’t leave. I'm fine that. Wow I'm shocked broken 21st century record. surprising bad swine flu yet little stir caused. Travel? remember days yore... rush blast media even bother notice mask picture different flight. Tell us jumping conclusions losing credibility? Spanish Flu, October 165,000 people died US. one month. 

You expect see similar figures. Covid worse Spanish Flu. It’s infectious deadly. reason people currently surviving modern medicine. didn’t even antibiotics 1918 sick people got nursing care. resources running out. hospitals filling up.

It’s going slaughter. Lots license plates jersey already said makes think wear mask? Yes, airline personnel questioned, get N95s? need none-covid related work reasons, would love new source actually available.

I know someone works 3M's N95 mask facility South Dakota, access raw materials would love know get them. I'll pass along source. Well kids attending... mentioned friend. means properly educate children possible. like idea private schools inherently better. grew all, ton private schools, required less credentials teachers we're actually vastly inferior public schools. think might me, seem recall discussion you.

According WHO, one wear face masks possible keep social distance.

The infection control expert Björn Olsen wants break Swedish taboo.

- usually wear face mask go shopping, says Björn Olsen.

On Monday, announced 230,370 new corona cases world registered last 24 hours. ever, curve steadily pointing upwards.

A total 12.9 million people infected, according Johns Hopkins University.

- starting get grotesque numbers. almost classic pandemic moves on. mainly southern United States hit extremely hard. situation South America, really escalating now, says Björn Olsen , professor infectious diseases Uppsala University University Hospital.

#""Became dirty word""

The fact many countries, including Sweden, expanded testing also contributes rising numbers. Increased testing several benefits, according Björn Olsen.

- **Those tested positive naturally try keep distance others. think also reason seeing decline Sweden, started test more. think effective way reduce infection**, says Björn Olsen.

At time, spread infection Sweden declining fast enough, professor believes.

- must prepare fact long time. also reports first tests vaccine excessively good. probably trust vaccine, trust social distancing, face masks, things like that. Face masks become something insult Sweden, properly used face masks are, all, important barriers, says Björn Olsen.

#Uses face masks yourself
The professor one 23 researchers repeatedly criticized ]Swedish Public Health Agency's]( strategy. latest [debate article]( , FHM criticized dissuading public using face masks. Since beginning June , recommends wearing face masks places difficult maintain social distance.
According 23 researchers, quite clear covid-19 contagious symptoms. [according Norwegian Institute Public Health]( studies show 20 45 percent infection country come pre-symptomatic infection.
- authorities stuck everyone face mask abuses it, spread infection even worse. like factual reports it. Quite opposite, says Björn Olsen.

**Do use face masks yourself?**
- Yes absolutely. go business, usually it. I've bit sloppy before, I'm becoming convinced actually works. protect me, protect others infected. That's about. also behavior look strangely someone wearing face mask, says Björn Olsen.

#""It's big mistake""

Another criticism Swedish Public Health Agency still give advice go work, school preschool even family member ill. 

- like mantra Swedish Public Health Agency, symptoms contagious. big mistake, think so, says Björn Olsen, professor infectious diseases Uppsala University.

The Public Health Agency's press service states advice face masks remains. questions, please refer tomorrow's press conference. Everything absolutely ass-backwards. federal government, entity capable supporting country nothing.

Instead choose dictate everyone doing, like school openings, determined local level based infection rates factors areas.  Except there's evidence anyone asked wear mask. best failed wear one times, see nothing suggest outright refused wear one.

UK hit badly many reasons. vast amount international arrivals, London’s density, public transport system, lockdown week late, maybe people wearing masks sooner would helped somewhat. However come people trying make profits selling trivial amount additional masks people still free make anyway. government even provides guide this! I'm hoping logistics work out. everybody country needing vaccine going determined gets first? like go doc pharmacy expect jab. going age group? alphabetical last name order? another method?

*If interested*....hey fully understand hope return pandemic passes

PS...some basic de-escalation tips

1. someone raises voice, keeping calm calm tone escalate things more. seen/felt condescending taken understand ""seriousness"" issue.

 raise voice theirs, level, always stay them, talk bring voice/tone down. subconsciously bring you.

2. Reflective listening, means repeat back saying shows understand frustration. possible, use slightly softer words repeat back. also subconsciously bring people down

3. Agree anyway you, responsibly, can

* bullshit because...*I understand pissed because...*

* can't fucking believe...*I get it, would angry if....

* hate this....*yeah see frustrating*

* I'm sick of...*no doubt, find annoying too*

There’s way they’d follow threat. father liver disease kill him. gets covid tomorrow, develops pneumonia dies ventilator, death certificate going list covid, liver disease. 

Again, I’m sorry coming crass. don’t mean make light tragedy losing parent. mean terminally ill one thing something else kill faster, it’s inappropriate list cause death, possibly listing cancer comorbidity. would interesting many covid deaths pre-existing conditions. 

Not intending downplay saying please take way.  understanding person say heart disease gets covid higher risk complications. covid happened, wonder many people would inevitably passed heart disease anyway.  literally feels like dystopia novel.

(Note: I'm sure number increased recently.) That's WAY LOW amount people. test 3X day 4X population. that's roughly equivalent us 1 days worth testing entire pandemic.

Vietnam conduct tests tests done early extremely aggressively. 275k tests, found 373 cases, that's 737 tests per positive result. US keep ramping testing people getting infected long period time. US performed 37 million tests 3.3 million positives. That's 11.2 tests per positive result. Vietnam tested 66 times US per positive result basis. 

The US missed chance use lockdown bring case level manageable level contact tracing testing. cats bag made problem much harder. hate lot - let's concrete source statement bub  thing people need paycheck survive. 

So either lose everything protesting showing up.

Or put lives risk.

The reason regions asking infected people “contact tracing” (at least case Stockholm) don’t believe staffing capacity contact tracing large enough scale. One reason contact tracing, regulations written, permits health care workers contact tracing. making local delegation, hopefully easier even bigger regions implement centralized contact tracing. Yikes, math hard. cancer heart disease growing exponentially, week week? No? post irrelevant. Philadelphia airport filthy joyless, another one avoid.

That exactly doing. read far studies supporting - children less contagious children contagious adult - short contradictory studies. point, think dangerous anything less cautious. investigate seriously? saw picture. Oh dear..... Thanks. Appreciate it! Way miss point. 

The idea someone “under investigation” wearing mask sounds like something you’d find satire Russia, China, Soviet Union, etc.

It’s ludicrous waste resources. Except voting mail always super easy FL. 

I agree factor states, nationally - DeathSantis can't relying this.  news 2 days mandate masks CO already! Yeaaaaah maybe need this, distance learning might better option.

Hi there, revisiting one month later. say global headlines last week Florida epicenter COVID19 USA tens thousands new cases per day there, I've thinking lot conversation had. say extremely curious... changed tune all? not? Actually, suppose would obvious, mostly not, not? Florida labelling tons deaths pneumonia. Plus they're State count probable deaths. Plus state terrible health insurance coverage many people die home. pictures 


I'm confused.  ""The numbers speak themselves!"" - Ron Deathsentence Ok - look - [here's video Dr. Fauci explaining There's plenty doublespeak sift through, longshot actually understand - worth shot.

&amp;#x200B;

What calling dishonest man dishonest. Nooooot super complicated idea. guess silent CDC’s production contaminated tests excluding private testing, early anti-mask messaging, guidance return Covid-positive patients nursing homes free hospital beds?

I’m fan administration, really don’t want CDC bear thing right either.

EDIT: hell machine South Korea automate [a million tests per SK since February. deaths still 1% nothing worry /s live. End second last week June, start day Labour Day. I'm pretty sure much Canada like that. know College/University Ontario ends April schools setup trimesters. faces better fit reusable respirators whether half-face full-face type.

Two news articles today... hmm wonder one important... I’m questioning dad died cancer, I’m sorry hear that. don’t believe random internet commenters claim cancer deaths labeled covid. 

If suffering cancer got covid, covid specific cause death, makes sense put down. seem implying cancer deaths maliciously relabeled doesn’t match reality **vast** majority cases. I'm OP fly visit medical facilities install train physicians techs critical safety equipment. We've transferred much possible online meetings still situations require site presence. travel March-May started back slowly June. Several places within driving distance since fortunately, want function travelling.  calculated loss. small percentage people die large percentage science friendly voters stay home suppose would net gain Republicans. Fortunately think Democrats force stop another four years madness irrespective Covid-19. I'd drive stay night, that's Even point pandemic, cheap fast reasonably accurate test would game changer Well shit. certainly want anyone fight improve anything retroactively benefit *you*. social distancing. easily take metro shop groceries keeping away people. heard anyone cough months. also controls restaurants, crowded places gets shut down. 

It's also different culture. Bragging ignoring risks, shown risking workers get butchered social media. American companies threaten employees, churches brag faith bigger fear. would work Sweden.

Young people visible careless, seem die. one 20 died. long keep away grandma distance older parents seems work.

But Sweden still slow react, I've seen cloth masks sale anywhere. Obedience please tests done, less positive cases. looks good. mean clusterfuck. Seeds gardening roped places could still buy alcohol. 

Logic would say home gardens better pandemic. I've seeing many friends feel like gone worry it. Seen people head Los Angeles, Myrtle Beach, Vegas others. matter time comes back. mean cruz, right? I'll take redneck Mad Max bullshit I've dealing 30+ years I've lived here. Also hate hot weather, everything temperature people repugnant. news story large house party causing 40 cases. 

No articles thousands people protesting, causing thousands postive cases. Internationally, protests seem linked Covid either. Canada cases linked back protest transmission far know (though Ontario best job contact tracing), Vancouver many protests, Montreal, three cities massively different results. KW actually larger BLM protests Toronto surprisingly (or unsurpringly; they're university tech tri-city) they've ahead Toronto reopening every stage due low, controlled case numbers. 

I think fairest say social interaction carries risk, risk strongly mitigated masks, social distancing, open airflow, depending well protest (not BLM) adheres three traits (plus others identified proven yet), events low high risk  I’m sorry going :( I’m suggesting ‘exponential surge’ doesn’t exist, peaks flattens it’s goes 0 it’s own. data says continues exponentially infects everyone without shutdown. prepared March, I'm realistic understand country filled bunch petulant children can't what's best us without crying personal freedoms. remember Malaysia worst-hit country Southeast Asia early on, mainly due large religious gathering. Seeing case numbers rise back shocking, many parts region (including Philippines, I'm from) hundred cases back then.

It's great manage get control, though. Malaysia's total cases nowhere near bad Indonesia, Philippines, even Singapore. Keep mind Malaysia treats workers similar Singapore does. dumb luck outbreak happened among Singapore's workers first, causing everyone Malaysia scramble test/socially distance foreign workforce. #1 thing convinced importance vaccines societal scale going older graveyards.

So many family graves. many tiny little ones. Entire families would wiped space weeks, babies ten year olds, look dates. Could fire? Could tragedy killed everyone short period time? course. Perhaps. likely explanation disease sort hit once.

There's small cemetery mile house. One larger grave, holds 17 year old sent Civil War, whereupon died within three months, disease. Three smaller graves cluster around it, little sisters, died time war over...... disease. 2/3 soldier's deaths Civil War disease, sides armies. Many diseases caused poor sanitation. prevent lot diseases today things vaccine (notably dysentery typhoid fever.) 

Herd immunity works prevent majority people getting sick. stop everyone getting sick. may end harmed helped vaccine, happens tragedy. work identify ones might truly harmed vaccine, vaccinate everyone else.

Modern graveyards still occasional tiny grave. since advent vaccines, lot less them. US #2 testing (at 43M, China 90M). Obviously falls look tests per capita though (where US around 20th). seems strange considering studies show virus live cardboard 24 hours plastics closer week. takes someone sneezing standing front isle, without mask on.

I let stuff sit week unless need needs cooled, I'll disinfect it. people asymptomatic contagious, probably caught short time departing gave everyone else board yeah better reputation management enforce safety policy. Remember ""We safety first..."" always remind pass 10th time without offering pre-departure cocktail. :) Dude that’s valid question. haven’t heard many kids dying either new information it’s true. right wing fixation now. Anyone conform MAGA talking points love dear leader sheep follows trendy media personalities. even trend /r/conspiracy /r/the_donald legitimately thought people hated Trump might souless ""NPCs"", non playable characters lacked free will. greatness obviously apparent people could possibly disagree actually human, got opinions left wing celebrities. I'm exaggerating making shit up. Go /r/conspiracy search NPC see yourself.

This carried coronavirus, anyone real mind see ""hoax"", ""sheep"" wear masks take seriously. I've seen tons memes half-joke, mask wearing government experiment see mindless followers, truly woke fall it.

Terrifying shit.

Edit: here's fucking stupid.

1. Flattening curve managing hospitalizations overwhelm hospitals give us opportunity improve treatment find cures. Hospitalizations going states hit hardest.

2. Spread healthier individuals eventually hit older risk populations higher mortality rate. young won’t die doesn’t mean aren’t going infect others. Especially don’t wear mask. 

3. Hospitalizations lag new cases; deaths lag hospitalizations. won’t know true impact surge well August.

I’ll gladly admit wrong September everything risen. WAY premature tomfuckery.  actually one city, done nearly major cities, here's news back joins three top tier Chinese cities gone lockdown mode, including Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing. According CCTV News, Shanghai Municipal People's Government held news conference prevention control novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Shanghai Center Disease Control Prevention (SCDC). press conference, Zhu Qinhao (朱勤皓), director-general Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau, confirmed city's 13,000 residential communities implemented ""closed community management"" measures entrance exit restrictions.""

If there's entry/exit ban, ""real"" shut down. Street empty meaningless me, get groceries? delivered government? not, means street grocery stores point, like shutdown, ""real"" shutdown. Hey - yes, episode 638 ""Do, try"" clinical update Daniel Griffin. Hello communism! already beginning to. Here's [listing](http://www.maltzauctions.com/auction/363014/155-acre-college-campus/) buy campus auction. agreeing started talking first world privilege people I've stepped on.

WTF man?

Why inventing persona me? Yeah even think taking seat. Great point hunting conspiracy none found. Everyone hopes right, one wants pandemic deadly, preparation key mitigation probable likelihood NY, Italy, Spain representative anomalous. goal posts moved understanding threat *has* changed. Viewing virus static condition allowing new better explanations mortality hard hit regions (when know potential kill many) short-sighted. Even today, ~5% less US' population (NYS) accounts ~23% US' deaths. ignores secondary fallout excess mortality. peak, around ~2.5% population (NYC) accounted ~55% US deaths. one wants deaths acting like *can't* happen setting us failure does. Except doesn’t admit claim article. 

DHHS says still established source interlinked clusters, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton record expressing scepticism protesters caught virus rally. argue point? I’m talking “herd immunity” crowd.  may profit may want cover costs occur whether parks open not. That's guess. also doubt profitable like this. words, less half testing positive truly antibodies.

I understand mean folks creating antibodies, fact know many false positives, type problem describing impossible measure - still know enough antibody response disease tests reliable - either direction. covid symptoms back January. Ended amoxicillin week later full body rash. told probably allergic amoxicillin even though I’ve several times. keep wondering covid! Okay, that's good know. find auto-translation articles Swedish really confusing! particular, headline says 81k samples, 81k tests.

But means could getting many test results! 80k tests 3% positivity get almost 30x many test results 30-pools. that's get massive amount positivity would drop increased testing factor 30.

I know Sweden ""trying"" test contain virus, outside areas high density elderly people. rest Europe goes forward suppression, they're missing huge chance join them. could easily eliminate virus testing everyone once, 10-20% immune keeping suppressed trivially easy. article seems conflict clickbait title. 

DHHS says still established source interlinked clusters, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton record expressing scepticism protesters caught virus rally. intellectually dishonest yourself.

Trust experts want, fact unwilling attempt come opinions dangerous game.

Good luck, done here. interest good discussion. Bored lonely better bored, lonely unable breathe Media interest covering it. Yeah New York counts death nursing home death die nursing home. nursing home resident gets sent hospital dies aren’t considered nursing home death. deliberately changed policy months ago. Record deaths? Time open schools! Thanks. actually thinking states report *cases* vs *people*. helps. response, Texas, Florida Arizona deciding let numbers catch states? kind response that?

It's like people one area started walking cliff, warned areas walk cliffs, too. areas responded saying ""bah, many people walking cliff. We're fine! need change anything.""

Correct response: put fucking sign says WALK CLIFF That's BS book that's clever discuss utterly empty reality.

Stupidity + Power malice. 

If stupid, fucking things malicious can't necessarily help it. 

If stupid power, automatically malicious better position anyone resources advisors balance actions. reason say fuck um show up. 9,100 new cases means 100-200 deaths two weeks. 

Go Flor-I-duh!!! one claiming positions disappearing loss grants, organic market service. European, I'm reading horror. WTH.... work medical imaging america. 100k year 4 1/2 weeks vacation. bad. feel like statewide mandate would least *help* situation. Visitors would know ""Colorado requires masks."" would highway signs state. keep track county in, get play dumb. ""wear damn mask"" (to quote Polis). aggravating. agree, making decision first step. 

Not everyone government tells them. There’s many numpties feel freedom wear mask important right infected someone may even know they’re carrier. cousin, business boomin'.

 fair, one photo cropped/blocked seats. could happy meal lap (based look him) see photo. isn’t though. link title see US still quite bad company. intent diminish mess US handling this; don’t like data displayed misleading ways comparing aggregate totals different sized countries. love reply even realize lol hear ""FAKE NEWS! *FFFAAAAAAAKE NOOOOOOS!!!""* Sure, also need respect seat someone, cannot force up. Whoever came last correct persont miss flight. free file complaints overbooking.

The airline booting him, standby anything, booked months advance, paying less flight person wanted take seat.  Good. Also fuck America. I'm outta first chance get. rabbi explained question whether Torah handed Moses Moses. 

Even handed Moses, write human language, incapable properly expressing majesty God. means, even believe Torah Moses directly writing given, merely translating divine words, divinity lost. can't accept there's pious Jews read Torah lens meditation understanding, that's anti-thetical everything. Uh, roughly one quarter us will

But referring immediately, total number deaths average good but, basically normal deaths, plus covid deaths, plus another chunk deaths. going say died covid since tested positive dumb venture waste time money. Retail worker education thinks understands virus. Lul.
""I'm sheep. I'm individual! know cus Daddy Joe Rogan tells so!"" many NY/NJ plates right NE FL. It’s like it’s hot heck pandemic vacation???! join Canada want fucking work.

not saying don't, draw many conclusions fact New York, epicenter, deaths now. could make argument disease worked way vulnerable kind immunity achieved part population. Perhaps both? Masks immunity? always could spread it, severe terms symptoms adults. bet still Florida. mean two states something moment.

And, He’s President United States America. think Hanlon's razor applies. 'Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity'.  want believe that. Slightly misleading headline though true effect.

Idk shit sports stadium sports would allowed play well.  England handled terribly. glad live Wales.

1. less deadly flu

 *Yep, definitely deadly media claimed, despite media gloom doom reality passes person person lot easier flu. right near deadly said far contagious flu, that's wear mask want accidentally give someone could hurt*

2. large scale mislabeling death

 *Yep, doubt shit gone full political bullshit. saw Washington counted gun shot victim. States want make trp.look bad doubt. Fuck them, assholes, thing spreads easy, I'm probably safe probably safe, carry know. wearing mask less likely hurt old person wiping nose. silly know figure least do*

3. Dems want keep Economy shut down

 *I doubt secretly thrilled economy fucked, probably shit fuck Trump more. Politicians fucking suck. Im sure shit wearing mask Pelosi says so. because, much sucks often feel silly, might keep accidentally giving someone flu might fuck up. say fuck politicians I'm still gonna wear mask*

They love planet. admit modicum truth say, acknowledge reality, far likely wear madks get one either.  Wrong dumb dumb, two pictures floating around. One plane drink wearing mask. one everyone commented saying can't wear mask drink time even though can't see mask anywhere close him. 

Because that, second picture came gate sitting also mask on, also drink hand insinuate might drinking. reptile man obviously wearing mask mandatory. guess goes famous republican mantra, rules thee, me. welcome! Let convention, since republicans convinced democratic hoax, kids?? lost all? America *is* Swedish model man That's dumb. wasn’t done 4 months ago? Teachers get penalized student fails, rather students. teachers dumb courses make sure even dumbest kid follow. Students take personal responsibility. certain splitting schools based aptitude - rich kids get good private schools. 🦃 Well, could right, let's look one.

The positivity mistakes handful hospitals way [the report](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf) list sorted volume. numbers big labs look right, odd numbers, fixed, serious effect overall numbers.

On hand, single day death number *may* important own, part continuing 7-day increase following record ramp-ups cases hospitalizations, then, yeah, maybe pretty big deal.

Partisan flip-flopping riot talking points lame nothing this... besides ""covid-denier"" movement started way riots pretty much shift talking points looking backwards reaction whatever happens. Cases down? big deal. Cases up? Deaths down. Deaths catch up? Overcounting! matter what, answer same: BIG DEAL.

But sure agree people lie science influence others. dare find upvoted post sub actually matches accusation tho Well Santa around we’re good. helps anyone close regularly tested We're not. headline hogwash. chief medical officers repeatedly stated there's evidence increase cases linked protests. Four people went tested positive, may may infectious time may may contracted protest. Genomic testing virus traced latest outbreak breaches hotel quarantine. info included article, yet chose go tangentially related possibility rile people up. cases coming close family gatherings indoor dining venues allowed reopen, protest held month ago. bet users sub jacking refrigerator truck pics. phase 3, trials typically give many people vaccine send loose wild data analyzed six months so. tens thousands people signing deliberately exposed vaccine research though, maybe we’ll skip waiting natural infection step spray face long sign waiver. Depends natural immunity. study showed antibodies could disappear within three months shorter. depends well immune system handles it. good = natural heard immunity. I've since....late January, early Feb so. I'm bored per se, maybe little desensitized all? I'm done 2020 whole though. Skip freakin' year. Doesn’t help much rest state won’t follow... Milkdrop still best automated music visualizer! politicians engaging insider trading profiting virus we're worried guy wearing mask? wear one either. Omg, system. says this? Even go zero today theres likely people get tested, already see swarm white (Jets Whiteout) starting August 1st reviving Covid careful  Per capita, 3x many deaths Cali days. Lol: teenagers think invincible: pretty sure lasts late 20s 🤣 Face shields stop direct spray contact. Since airborne qont ANYTHING stop spread school I’m deathly afraid virus. It’s also ruined every single thing going life devastated children. stand line hours, I’m voting. husband.  

Just like needed go ER couple weeks ago, things priority. wonder many parents actually going let kids go school...If kids Id let back school CDC hasn’t said this, little evidence pointing towards re-infection early on. concerned sometimes overcoming grief important help cover fucking nose it, either. likely explanation smaller labs didn’t report tests run/ negative tests reported tested positive.  


The chart also states it’s tests run, per person- shouldn’t used people using it. doesn’t effect percent positive per day based ‘per person’ metric. test positive, end hospital test again, number isn’t supposed reported two positives week- it’s number tests run different number people tested. Many people multiple tests- think health care workers. case guys didnt know- AAMC still requiring premed students show person around 6 hours test indoors- across whole country. twitter Im seeing students test positive taking MCAT. 


I mean love Fauci take AAMC grain salt mean Ohio. basically mean states:

New York
New Jersey
Delaware
Conneticut
Massechusetts
Rhode Island
Vermont
New Hampshire
Maine can't see getting House. would expect Pelosi one leverage point.  someone works city great hear! Sounds like actually looked question several months then. Voice deep bunker probably: don’t kid. Let tell — let make clear: got greatest refrigerator trucks anywhere world. put covid victims ice better anybody world. refrigerator trucks best world, them. pretending required. Agreed, it’s kind like snowball effect.  Antibodies never stick around forever. That's immunity works. car accidents labeled covid,
Obviously Gotcha. Thanks. GOP absolutely nuts. Mask hand sanitizer load bullshit, thing health condition prevents wearing mask.

If cannot wear mask, already ventilator.

Ask HR give examples health conditions, CDC currently aware medical condition preventing usage mask. top that, since company policy prevented due medical condition? HR's job publish policies grant exemptions case case basis, someone medical issue, get exemption policy proving it. sad heroes die 6 months now. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* read article explained one reason labs high positive rates due testing occurring. 
Take grain salt article didnt go specifics amd talking general nature boiled - 

High positive rates suggest people tested already noticably sick. example test overflowing hospital testing people experiencing symptoms going extreamly high positive result randomly spot testing testing general population supermarket.
Generally speaking, simply testing already sick hospital isnt good indication actual infection rate going considerably higher capturing randoms spreading illness - sometimes unaware even sick. capturing results sickest people. 

So based said would questioning tests labs coming from.

Edit - didnt read articles posted sources. Ignore said legitamitly errors reporting. Ironically call everyone snowflakes would rather watch world die put fabric face. background pharmaceutical trials allows make point? Link pic? looked pretty hard find mask all. off. people believe shit guy says? mean, really. work teams due lack social concerned social life studies

So poor social skills spend time socializing?  Airlines take $25 billion free money, worm around main restrictions. ""We fire them, furloughed them"".

I'm pissed gave free money. business model got crushed, really get anything it. could done good ""saving"" others it, I'm sick bailing slimey companies.

Even bail out, would airlines. Maybe ones, cares. Except stockholders. Yeah, mileage program mags miles get like lifetime subscription People, People en Español! Yeah areas w reduced spread may better term. said, hear out:

I live one bubbles Oregon, Benton county cases low due college fairly liberal base despite population otherwise rural. Case count consistently low people following rules fairly well. current school plan hybrid classes w 2 days week kids. remote option also available. There’s chance we’re going infections school closures, otoh there’s also decent chance get year major cases. Depending college could also next fucking epicenter here. 

I’ve putting foot exclusively WFH due kids lack summer care (we got 2, infant 6yrold), gets difficult schools opening caseload low area. boss back willing let continue burning 8hr vacation week time “only” 32 billable hours weekly. everyone option, hand may forced.

There’s also FOMO kids part. daughter wants go back school. She’s going ask friends going back isn’t. resentment going grow especially nothing happens terms outbreaks. There’s personal connection people got sick, despite smart 6yrold it’s still difficult situation understand. 

I know safe option right option that’s plan doing, still sucks weigh risks. It’s privileged position relative people states cases exploding yet want kids classrooms, I’m living with. eat lunch put mask pocket fall. Im sure even call restart make money hourly jobs education requirements. losing besides sunk cost education? find PCR rate separated antibody tests? find combined rates Florida's reports. Edit another question: Florida's official data mentions PCR + antigen, PCR + antibody -- sure Florida including antibody tests data? Maybe wait November 4th say this. hate tell this, 90% Democrats believe daily massive BLM protests/gatherings spread virus.

Both sides putting heads sand supports ideology. Good thing there’s like 3 military bases San antonio, feeling we’re going make Italy look like cake walk here.  Hopefully ban like would passengers. submission removed because

Need backup plan case one class entire school closes. nightmare going start closing travel Covid hotspots. I'm living city 300,000 basically fully open, minus large concert/party venues. also contact tracing, every bar restaurant go to, fill form info. US looks crazy us side pond. talking state turning people away emergency rooms ordering refridgerated trucks, governor refuses make mask requirement mandatory (counties opt out, 70% have) shut down.

He might fire all, would absolutely fuck severely pulling health insurance fucking pension. He'd probably even consider victory it. decline!

Edit: thought /s obvious b could seen coming? live dorm/apartment whole semester. students go home weekends it'll cause issues. schools planning open go online Thanksgiving help accommodate this. knows fake idiocracy flat mind blowing. Effectively 100k cases last 10 days. Shut restaurants? Theatres? Gyms? Limit people Wally world, grocery stores, etc? course not, would make sense.

I swear, way Desantis sees daylight trump yawns. probably change groups, watch pressers. Dude present today's meeting Putting pieces place hide numbers. knew coming. Lying strategy ever had. Existing antibody tests useless 1% population infected, infected people got virus previous two weeks.

They're useless 20% population infected.

;) know OP article also shows sitting terminal mask either..... right? saying eat anyways? Nothing, cutting get point across nothing will.  adequate testing tracing numbers go could easily get schools open basically everything else. problem stands right max test capabilities private sector tracing test take 7 days come back. 

Every developed nation open sit around thumbs asses people wear mask Federal Government response shit. 

POTUS FEMA, CDC even Pentagon setup testing facilities using Defense Authorization Act make PPE, testing supplies. hurt earliest worst nature living situations huge amount domestic international traffic get , didn’t listen experts. wasn’t National PPE shortage proper testing system available time, would hit hard. data gear keep numbers low, even dense living quarters, got numbers really low kept low, states data gear have, number climb. “40%” getting smaller smaller every day.

Your point invalid. Well, lot Redditors US, loooooong way away able get back normal without complete shit show. Hooray! USA delivers another gold medal performance Stuff-you-really-don't-want-to-win-at olympics! nailed Trifecta incarceration rate, poor healthcare, decline middle class too! admit we've enough greatness? policy general unless kind freak accident. cite source also? social media. There's entire ecosystem actual media that's sprung cater alternative facts news. 30-40% country literally lives alternate reality. seen photo? mask sight Yes. Absolutely. Wholeheartedly. Arizona two years ago. right work state too. didn’t go strike. went “walkout.” 50,000 teachers marched onto state Capitol. close schools week half legislature caved.

Do let language stop you. “It’s illegal strike” means nothing unless allow stop you. It’s designed make think can’t. can’t fire teachers, know it. That’s nothing happened us Arizona. also photo sitting gate unmasked without coffee right flight. never even mask wear means let flight mask - policy. Zodiac Killer strikes again. One refrigerator trucks gonna break gonna smell like 50 dead bodies Texas summer heat. Yes Fidgeting.... constantly tell 9yo ""Please stop touching mask... Please stop touching face"" Yes supposed $20.00  Defenestrate. countries testing like cases going eventually go up. Gloves provide false sense security unless changing everything touch needed thanks suggestion already two car payments, one credit card (with 5000 balance) usual bills. fan loans/debts. I've posting today folks understand virus left fester.

Step 1: Convince base virus.

Step 2: Block legislation vote-by-mail

Step 3: Republicans unafraid vote person virus rages uncontrolled November

Step 4: Win election due deadliest form voter suppression side genocide uhh even giving parents choice run schools? either children comply masks home school them. context, that's good post. I'll part erasing downvotes! might wrong maybe go hell actually. I'll Google again. recommendation looks like something - ""wash hands regularly"", ""keep distance others""

What recommendation looks like something - ""don't visit elderly relatives"", ""don't go public symptoms""

This neither. literally lack recommendation either. Happy Bastille Day! need government runs science, politics. aren’t king ventilators? Look Trump. lies time, calls everything fake news. one holds accountable, yet normal lie ls court, could facing real issues.  Yikes, kids need exercise. ( ) also blew mind Greyhound buses would this. missed flight before. Wear mask shh bb ok &lt;3 can't deal stupid anymore. can't. professors? exactly spring chickens. Yes--I saw comparison made comment. Neither staff offered fake photo. photo mean put mask point flight. mask supporter months.

AGAIN (if read comments), I'm fan Cruz... I'm opposed form ""journalism."" google ""Cruz mask airplane"" right now, EVERY major news story, still fully investigated. know airlines in-cabin cameras/constant video feed, do, I'm going assume AA's investigation include looking footage flight. shows Cruz putting mask finished coffee, claims did, mainstream media look like witch hunting assholes. suggestion? Wait facts splashing across front page. type reporting harm good. know, that's said small percent. teachers choice, will. that's point. Enough teachers quit cause massive shortage. ""thought useful medicinal herb Ayurveda, conclusive clinical evidence effective treating ailment.""

So, woo.  think hard compare strategies US sweden, sweden there's government paid health care sick leave, probably take significant economic hit US child get sick. probably makes populations react bit differently outbreak like comes taking responsability case symptoms. That's exactly it. Problems endocrine system, sleep disturbances, stress, genetic predispositions, even infrequent eating cause weight gain. quality food makes difference. nutrient poor, body store fat make sure needs. Maybe open textbook instead listening rando gym. Que?

I mean, citizens living paycheck paycheck preventing real lockdown, profit healthcare discourages testing, electing moron leader proberbly dont know difference virus bacteria, pretty obvious going turn day 1 Could imagine were! update this? see going around facebook feed right countries Johnny would get smacked hard body would create vaccine assume ill intent down-playing effort NY containing virus. Herd immunity playing big role. many measures (social distancing, masks, etc. ) state taken play big role. US-States look NY nations want contain spread. definitely think last sentence explains like here. us cruel lives literally competing people, least indirectly. mean fuck, even finding home competition getting difficult, example, people simply existing means fewer resources people.

I hate modern life nothing stress, US definitely anything help citizens. point may 30 years gamble kids life every time get car, that's argument Understand you’re buying coverage for. People try use things aren’t policy like wellness preventative care. schools one main vectors viral parasitic transmission. I’ve seen entire grade level wiped lice matter days. avoid lice avoid contact child. Imagine virus spread though coughing sneezing. top 3 worst countries worst. Brazil Russia trying catch us miserable here. leader world, set stage idiotic countries fuck well there's much pushback universal healthcare ""socialism"".

That it. Poor Anthony landlords redact leaches. giving NSA nearly enough credit.

Looking solely data trends governance rolled (very little) - sure numbers continue go quite while....at current rate, Florida beat New York infected case #s two weeks....yay...#1...... Remember, guy’s vote counts much does. won’t close schools. sick idiocy regarding pandemic. Nah, American thing kick ass, get sued, pay huge settlement never admit fault. Increasing evidence virus commonly enters via eyes plenty cells ACE2 receptors loves. key stay away people minimize time spent people. Distance time crucial factors exposure. mask still good idea arguably even *more* important everyone it’s way, way better ensuring don’t get people sick. Good job Manitoba! **preferential Edit: know words pretend smart. Great bullshit confuse devide people. mistake give fuel people think whole thing's hoax. It’s great that’s option, parents supportive children. children good relationships parents. 

Also, areas broadband technology requirements, especially rural areas US. 

I actually work public health equity policy huge problem. work regarding telehealth, able complete assignments would also issue people lack quality internet access. mean, also think people way worried catching virus.

Oh boogieman virus! Nobody tell anything solid live total paranoia.

Guess what? went 4 months without mask gloves working retail dealing far customers normal. Nothing. Nobody around got sick, nobody died, none daily customers ever stopped showing daily. took tally see many people wore masks store. 4%.
4% people wearing masks, community almost cases, new cases far between.

Also, got incredibly low death rate realize many people asymptomatic / showing symptoms. apparently last long surfaces anymore, spreads air primarily. Completely opposite said months ago. 

I wont wear mask went 4 months wearing one height pandemic, nothing bad happened. proven unnecessary. need experts telling think able make conclusions.

Let experts dictate life want, kind makes people able called sheep. 

Stand believe backbone. dont care think know. know experienced, need bunch people cowering home entire pandemic telling behave. Haha yes Newark airport usually enter US into! rotten. worst thing come queue customs need go use toilet. bottom stalls end ridiculously high floor. said ""according post"" used ' instead "" indicate uncertainty whether exact quote. get gist said correct, without direct quote. right here. it’s glaringly obvious anyone paying attention her. Set standards pressure public schools making unsafe choices parents left blaming public schools seek “alternatives” end enriching circle influence. It’s honestly fucking criminal hope justice swift. ""Countless"" labs reporting errors yet article video list four? Okay. video scroll multiple pages single one say proceed blur pages can't even see ourselves. 


The kicker ""shocking"" article labs reported 100% positive test results reality around 10%, enough move 11% positive rate significant way. Hey bro ain’t like that! “Nazis opinions too, wrong.” Exterminate Reporting lags extreme many different systems; Sweden deaths added tally 4 weeks event.

In USA, many things, depends locality, many coroners professional medical training inclination participate data-gathering. 3143 county-level equivalent divisions US, deal deaths decided local voters much anything. confirm. Live michigan, also know bunch dumbasses. people showing office rifles demanding open everything back ivory tower ""well nursing homes""... Lunch wagon half tables closed. /r/ghanasaysgoodbye Crazy. We’re charter school within Capistrano Unified. We’ll know soon enough guess. sickens solely public health issue turned political issue. Pence Trump managing catch virus? Lol. mask point.

NY numbers going back up, cant keep this. referring behaviors.

Edit: since mentioned... higher percentage positive Manhattan.

Additional edit: NY times paywall back covid news longer “essential“, proof “it’s over”(tm) everyone go back party demand. clearly done research.
 
Singapore 40,000 tests per day.

Singapore's population = 5.5 million.

Malaysia 16,000 tests per day.

Malaysia's population = 35.5 million.

If authors admit this, confused resistance to. 

Questioning research critically auto negate support towards protestors (if you‘re possibly stuck). careful check confirmation bias here. 

Unfortunately, isn’t plethora approved, peer reviewed, tested replicated, research available today. It’s realistic claim say that. Scientific research rules, protocols, process. still infant stages learning it. It’s recent novel virus. respect opinion, it’s realistic.

The entire paper around sixty pages long. trying assume actually read whole thing, I‘m getting impression actually did. 

My personal opinion, little matters, study provides weak argument based possible correlation two (of many) variables, using questionable data. Additionally, lot existing variables considered. claimed things asking prove since start conversation. going this? Making covid daily top cause death, beating heart disease almost fifteen percent.

(Btw, adults run schools. don’t send alone. Although, teacher here, year might!) Hey borrow one?

Alternatively, somehow sabotage ridiculous military budget, y'all feel good old colonialism? grocery store workers cry much told go work? Fuck shithole country. Lost said decent chance get year major cases. Maaaaybe kids, want tell wouldn’t direct impact teachers, bus drivers, school administrative staff faculty? don’t know you, I’d willing reason good portion co morbidities. doesn’t even mention families children. 

It inevitably increases likelihood spread exponentially. concern someone,potentially children, may probably get sick, even end discomforting hospital

From psychological perspective, get social aspect, get learning aspect. large part believe things alternatively focused provided enough extent get next year. needed spend last 4 months innovative online learning socialization, instead banking person schools “work” Covid. Coronavirus taking talents South Beach missed April’s fools day months. Leadership dead.  incentive China lie massive pandemic, \*after give covering up, declare massive pandemic\*? gain declaring 4634 deaths instead 7123 deaths?

The benefit convincing people zero deaths. literally true January 11, rapid rise made obvious would impossible cover even week later.

The ""China lied"" point almost axiomatic people, there's little material reason believe they've lied virus since Wuhan lockdown.

They delayed talking publicly human transmission (which doctors ground started talking December 30), three weeks. That's it. put statement pneumonia cluster December 31, said human transmission confirmed, weeks later. That's bad enough. need make things up. level Chinese government hoping would blow over, dealing complete unknown nobody ever seen reasonable hope, hoping report failure ask help superiors. cases escaped China early January (a Thai man hospitalized Jan 8 assume many asymptomatics). Depends location school district. I'm Texas make decent money teach surprised manager Target made would teaching back hometown. bad is, EWR today 10x better EWR 10 even 5 years ago. imo, EWR still miles ahead LaGuardia. airport ever bad LaGuardia. Truthfully, first lock really effective less affected areas, states really essential piece establishing robust test-and-trace programs possible numbers low.

The lock TX, instance, kept daily cases 1,000 April. hired 5,000 contact tracers time, instituted stricter mask policies, expanded testing capacity, verge shutting economy 28 million people again.

They bought time, profoundly squandered it. problem. love picture. looks like pouty toddler. /r/pf filled silver spooners idea ""I X thing received payout, everyone else X thing receive payout!""  created opportunities China? Well carry then. Don’t forget horsey sauce. ashamed Miami resident. can’t believe began isolating March 13th face worst 4 months later. It’s even harder you’re living immunocompromised person (from cancer, less.) 

Our elected officials garbage. Deathsantis garbage, Trump garbage, mayors (Giménez &amp; Suarez) garbage.

Mayor Giménez said would close restaurants gyms last week backtrack constituents protested satisfied demands since he’s running Congress. It’s crazy would sacrifice constituents order win. It’s incredibly selfish representative we’re facing Miami. problem agree disagree actually longer works situation. philosophical disagreement. information people actually need know best help themselves. negative knowledge tool arsenal improving treatment literally saving lives. 

I actually spend lot time talking people ledges sub. particular study formalized version issue we've seen mounting evidence lot teeth behind it, real, exaggeration. 

I'm sorry like it, something recovering patients need know knowing possible could actually save vs brushing scary. Doctors need know risks patients, doctors patients need aware follow care may crucial, recovered patients need know warning signs may indicate need either change behavior reduce risk get medical care. information average person act benefit. here, noone gives 2 shits Thankfully we're hook one. Bubonic plague bacterial, standard antibiotics work. Shame work viruses. No. people getting tested likely it, majority either showing symptoms exposed it. can't say 16% Floridians (which would 3.4 million anyway, that's wrong). Imagine living country still dealing covid (*laughs danish*) Either limit number medical exemptions doctor provide, require two doctor sign-offs exemption, both. national vaccination record system. Um, ever Florida July? HOT, HUMID. Locals survive moving one air-conditioned space another, spending little time outside possible. one wants spend day walking around Disney World 95 degree heat 99% humidity. Plus, literally rains every single day around 3 pm. Tourists come winter, miserable every else, balmy 70 degrees here. ""Reports deaths"" deaths still occuring. Incorrect, coronavirus hoax get trump office allow lazy democRATs create welfare state always wanted! /s 

But seriously, way talk unemployment benefits nothing ongoing worsening pandemic completely insane strong enough kill viruses probably strong enough cause cancer live suburb outside chicago. Please please please report restaurant way can. We're waiting baited breath see keep phase reopening valid. I'm thinking can't. I'll make sure report restaurant see listening, though really seem people around following rules.  four voted favor publicly shamed. Sounds like throw bus since plan dismiss half workforce future thanks gentleman. dad shared want scream. mistake negate everything else going on. aware something like herd immunity work, people would die. Right? point #1 one reason oppose concept lockdowns together. 

 difficult get timing right. time cases really blowing exponentially I'm sure there's much benefit shutdowns worst already taken place, data shows people voluntarily adjusting behavior reducing effective reproduction rate virus states mandated closings. like mention shutdown early ruined economy, took liberties away end mattering anyways. 

 order lockdowns truly effective would go effect short period time cases blow up, obviously can't know advance. know everyone wants blame protests spikes, reality situation number people protesting US orders magnitudes smaller number people going business minimal precautions. Protests clusters it’s hundreds thousands people gathered clusters smaller one bar restaurant. “If don’t like America leave.” Except can’t now... drinking damn coffee people. I've seen people lay lap reason. Tell make law, direct complaints mayor's office Govt - ' get back work, breeder. kids property state' I'm Australian spent lot time Oregon find saying lot goes: ironic nation called ""United States"" least unity states developed nation is. want split Washington 2 states people different ideas, people NorCal/Southern Oregon want make state Jefferson. 

How many states many? much division much? “Forty-eight Florida hospitals, including eight Miami-Dade, reached ICU capacity, according Agency Health Care Administration.”

Why cover image people beach instead people masks desperately seeking medical care? likely first 1,000 plus deaths/day US quite time. Sad. dumbass president also care. Add Arizona list Lol could’ve told people wear mask minimized spread wouldn’t need this, premature dotard bad is, Rhode Island, promising open schools fall. consider online, aunt, grandmother cousins middle it. scared, especially mandate masks worn schools cause ""small chance kids get COVID"". failure online classes never really working enforce kids, want back fall. first zombieland. Tallahassee talking Columbus rumors uninfected places. Combination many factors. left wing CA lot anti-vaxxers right wing anti-mask. basically good amount people making situation worse. Also lot people states came spread it. 4th July weekend lot people Arizona came CA beaches I’m sure spread like crazy. major cities also big protests last month lot didn’t wear masks. Newsom also opened quickly. supposed phased opening course several months went Phase 1 Phase 3 like 2 weeks. even outdoors?

edit: serious question u/tenyearstendays, want know diligent research found universal mask use, even outdoors, would good idea? Fake news. drinking coffee. oc supervisors joke. oc board education joke. Dr. Chau joke. come fuck orange county Plenty people go Harvard Law poor understanding statistics pertain healthcare testing. reasonable enough people recognize this. DeSantis not. definitely! Research community colleges near . resources much cheaper ! Also stopped running trails LOVE pavement hurts  Reopening schools last thing pandemic. Period. Philadelphia cancelled public events gatherings end February 2021. Holy crap.

Looks like they’re trying condition deniers accepting long term thing. looks great literally ""Trump sabotaged testing publicly defended sabotaging testing, declaring COVID problem know it"" Thanks, edited it! Vote. Write congressional representatives saying want see laws established leadership pandemics.

Unfortunately, think anything Abbot illegal (just evil fuck, likely vein ""we make rules think anyone would do... *that*""). that's first thing needs changed, need guidelines set stone leaders required pandemics.

So... standard course action. Vote people tried right thing pandemic. Write congressional representatives (especially tried right thing pandemic). Demand action. Make voter issue. frustrating seems like voice matter, gets drowned out, keep shouting. valid hypotheses dozens studies looking into. 

And everything know coronaviruses, that's likely unlikely. 

The literature pouring incredible rate, sample sizes fairly small. No, critical pretty much means breathing machine. look numbers places way virus seems function guess could put around 10% would considered ""severe""? Also relevant- administration trying circumvent current CDC regards reporting officials Monday finalized new data reporting protocol hospitals, **eliminate Centers Disease Control Prevention data recipient**, leaving health-care institutions report information covid-19 federal contractor state, would coordinate federal reporting. Wow really put work ""But can't show up!""

Makes think self-righteous folks watching movies WWII wondering German people could go along Hitler ordered. Wondering world one anything. Germans could've looked way people dying. might even actively done anything bad - following orders playing along worried negative consequences made accomplices.

All kids spreading virus homes. siblings, parents, grandparents. people go spread virus even further.

But oh teachers can't possible anything mah jahb.

So, feel smack middle historical situation like that? easier behave, ordered? easy smug comfy couch - easy actually part history making, it. could also sold seat twice. Meanwhile unemployment bonuses end two weeks, live shithole. /r/wallstreetbets

That's released virus. realize approx 70 million die every year, right? I'm speaking nature pandemic billed media shills global apocalypse. Based rhetoric reddit certain news media, one would think setting foot outside house without mask spells instant death people dropping like flies. farther truth. disingenuous fear mongering stupid.

Edit: meant 70 million. Corrected. lot Philly built dense, outbreak would explosive there. 

Glad see this. love Philly. Would hate see get wrecked. Unfortunately won’t enforced. Empty gesture “The experts need use wisdom help us trying live this”.

Hmm, no. don’t tell experts do, way around. That’s they’re, know, experts. Done! New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts top three death counts entire country account 40%... guess we're agreement? ---- 7/14/2020 Lead way NYC, well done hope gets squashes quickly then.

Right, I’m saying wearing mask be-all-end-all. I’m even sure could get interpretation. 

I’ve also commenting people threads social distancing guidelines aren’t concrete either. 

Basically people seem heads they’re 6 feet away, don’t need mask... true. also seem think they’re less 6 feet away someone mask make problem go away, also true. 

I think we’re arguing side got confused started arguing other. I’m sorry frustrated you, worried using argument I’ve seen lot recently people saying “these masks don’t protect me, wear them?” didn’t think *exactly* saying, that’s something people interpreting leaning into. 

But you’re absolutely right. There’s way sure you’ll safe not, best way add layers protection ourselves. one thing enough. Social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, avoiding public spaces possible we’ve got. 

Stay safe there! safe can. hate we’re this, we’re together. works, major turning point battle viruses. RNA vaccines ton potential. bet conversation couple went something like this:

Also, vaccines actually based years research, geared SARS MERS. That's went trial quickly- small tweaks vaccines already created. Oxford already gone lab studies theirs, example. process actually quick looks. feel like China quarantining largest cities entire world kinda canary. NYC got hit hard bc heed warning.

But they'll enforce armed robbery. Shhh. praise democrats here, despite facts. Typical Florida retirees. Years years paying social security supporting boomers making ignorant reckless decisions public health. Way pay forward. I'm sure I'll make better decisions social security money — oh wait see that.



Now, Canada paying monitor boomers. reopen cruise lines, ship retired ignoramuses middle ocean keep quarantined there? Humans tend compartmentalize problems small easily handled packages/groups make seem easier solve. saying “it’s humanity, it’s specific sub-sect that’s problem” makes seem simple.

It’s republicans. It’s lot ignorant stubborn apathetic people. There’s ton people Northeast don’t wear masks wear incorrectly. % better, ignorance still exists. right different. New York 32 thousand deaths. states remotely compete massive death toll neighbors, New Jersey 15 thousand deaths Massachusetts 8 thousand deaths. yeah, definitely right, living north east different rest USA vastly less loss life.

I don’t believe death numbers quite honestly. corona death classified different ways different places. feel like many people think somebody dies it’s neat organized specifically say X person died cause. doesn’t work way. there’s point debating accurate death case numbers end day nobody really prove anything. coronavirus first started. southern states soon cases place work youre free call osha report violations. doesnt matter min wage appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* thing now. spending time outside people North good weather aunt mustache she'd uncle. amazing many people absolutely refuse wear mask properly,or all, 20 minutes grocery store.

&amp;#x200B;

Now completely destroy argument...

&amp;#x200B;

First all, back April, society PRACTICALLY UNIVERSALLY social distancing, can't even stress enough! Like... dementia like god, Biden? fucking scary; like something straight ""1984"". 

Second all, noticed every country that's multiple waves, second wave smaller first? Well, there's reason that. Every wave starts people living normally. example, global wave started late March due people even knowing social distancing is, we're still said wave people scared live normally. course, ""experts"" say people develop immunity virus. Sure, thousand people gotten twice more, that's compared 10 million. Yes, quarantine works point, global scale, matter much ""experts"" tell us wash hands, socially distance, wear masks, ext., can't get everyone comply. think people tried before? craziness Texas may turn blue.

There chance blue wave may sweep Presidential, Congressional, State, local elections.

I care, want ever office try get family killed COVID due lack leadership, science based policies, political words Arizona 92 today, adjusted population that's getting 900 compared country (the UK), peak deaths little 1200/day -- we're considered worst outbreak Europe.

And point we'd locked 3-4 weeks. going get bad. Hell, already is. still really worried statistics shown virus spreads minority communities most. Best stand down, stop possible spread, save lives, vote November. hit streets virus recedes vaccine available. soon tell. book nonrefundable travel plans, that's sure. 

IF Oxford vaccine approved September rolled October, even 300 million doses AstraZeneca producing risk right enough stop pandemic, slow drastically, especially coupled already gotten gotten it. 

I'd say there's chance, really soon say. Phase 1 really like front line infantry.  That's article says all. pretend....how's going you? convenient excuse them. Failed State. may started actions home lead current situation. sure for, 10 hospital patients? Everything us. mean Mask could stop this. Think that. I'm sure we're planning use testing monitor asymptomatic outbreaks schools right? Right?! Please???

Let's least serious safely. trump dumped new [side kind reddit-needs-to-read-the-article case, though. County Board actually make decisions school actions. CA, local boards that, decision vote allow within county.  Almost every actual school district restrictive this.

I'm writing watching local board make fall decision.  tough one unwinnable everyone. LOL admit shit retarded  process get certification went faster GM expected

They asked April.  coffee brought flight outside. means wearing one coming either.

Prove wrong mean economy coming back benefit . Believe company lot good philanthropy charity work. L shaped depression? still Canada ?   
Is anything forces pay fine ? really need ask question point? answer resounding yes. yay? F amount people RI visiting NYC beginning year going home probably lot higher NYers summer home there. 

People seem forget given normal day, NYC something like 2 million extra people flooding work, tourism, etc. That's spread virus, people. Sure, let's send little Johnny back private school classes capped 8 online alternative available. send kids nearest private school social distancing measures, masks classrooms 30 kids. easy recommend opening schools know full well privileged rich kid attendance. Well look Christians thinking it’s gateway “new world order” even thought Obama anti christ people eat Right, logic Trump... Okay. Factor then. change point? Sweden historically low mortality last year. neighbours not.
Covid kills people die things every year.
And Norway significantly lower mortality Sweden. Denmark slightly lower, Finland's higher.
If discount Stockholm, Sweden par Norway anyway. many die Stockholm? knows. many die Bergamo? New York?
There always cities harder hit others, health care system screws up.

And remains seen happens next half year.

Do note I'm counting *all* deaths, reported covid-fatalities, I'm myopic. see daylight trump yawns found way introduce light body? there's actual hard data saying this, anecdotes. Plus know recovery long time. thing pneumonia. American airlines left stranded Colombia March without emails messages. travel 45 minutes another city book flight Spirit airlines. Fuck american airlines. hope go bankrupt. going happen even trying. American, believe happen put effort. Here's Bitcoin address. 3LixoSAGPaVaEB61jJvHQjktYoBKV1MJgq article states vouched conduct ECGs heart scans due inherent danger technicians. also:
""The majority (901) known heart disease study showed similar changes. Almost half (46 per cent) one eight (13 per cent) showed abnormal changes severe dysfunction respectively. changes observed first time patients’ Covid-19 illness researchers believe could due effects virus."" that's worth anything you.  hitting 1k today assumes vaccine work. know yet. Yeah, people still go parks whatnot pleasant temperatures. Beach weather form nice weather know. 

Outside vs. inside almost certainly huge factor. protests showed this. Dr. Drosten predicted R value would drop 0.5 summer too. US south hot weather forcing everyone inside closed windows ac blasting also shows this. Getting joke means you’re risk take additional precautions. Spring weather south okay, start summer almost hot outside. Last weeks total shit ""Meanwhile rest country licking every fucking doorknob see"" - fiancee soon said article title Ignorance! American way!

/s And? US definitely anything help citizens.

lmao. really believe this?  Calm Karen 11% positivity aswell.... Gilbert told Commons Science Technology Committee might better result vaccine natural immunity obtained individuals recover basically, that’s one possible vaccine amongst hundreds way. 
It’s potentially long lasting, there’s many doses made already.

I’m sure getting info from, please research. Winter coming,hope bbq's worth it. Good things schools still opening up!

-Signed worried elementary school teacher ten minutes outside Philly. forget winter flu No, refugees forced country found refuge Sweden neighbouring countries(around Sweden) rejected. Ah ok! Thanks literally trying save necks.  You’re diminishing saying “driving circles hours.” That’s like telling gamer “press buttons hours” soccer player “runs around 90 minutes.”

I don’t really care either way, kinda bashing it. might, read airline’s terms, first class mandatory mask rules. Presumably eat/drink flight anyway. never Russia Romania used live hung around lot them...they love saying “Stupid Americans” lol hate country much. point school opens second week August. go back work first week.  thought run mill fox article read doc appeared fox friends. Hopefully helps change people's attitudes. That's changing definition ""better"". Better sense test uniformly. Certainly US worse Europe containing disease (though 3 countries listed higher number deaths per capita US). globally hard say well populous countries (India, Russia, Nigeria, China, Iran, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil....) simply means obscure data. U.S., even faults, decent job testing reporting. Good luck getting accurate count Russia. Good luck getting adequate testing Brazil India. compare us San Marino....okay suck. compared India....who knows what's going simply coverage testing. ""Higher positive rate""? we? feel confident enough numbers coming India understanding 1.4 Billion people doing? vacation. teach West Ada, I’m worry, go ahead add “anxious” outright “scared” list adjectives. ”lets drive place another country completely disrespect laws”

Im embarrassed American...
THIS CANT NICE THINGS remember press conference someone US government agency said discovered virus caused AIDS. would vaccine end year.

I think scene lot now.

I think captured Gross. Maybe people start getting teach kids instead college educated, indoctrinated libruls.

Interesting disconnect - simultaneously believes teacher brainwashed full bullshit, trusts said teacher educate/raise child. that's mean saying 'Make America great again' Yup. Sorry 2 writing. Shoulda bed. likely they've interacted guys handed supplies them. Indeed. It’s called “reading” one forcing go Disney World, man. feel like WORST customers right now. Shame everyone tip TWICE amount usually risk life margarita. Animals. it. Planes notoriously dirty they're cleaned ""extra"" mean they're clean. Also, spending several hours close proximity people breathing, environment previously also full people close proximity breathing inspire lot confidence safety. country, every level government businesses insisting 1.6m minimum personal separation. People wearing mask. There's way social distance plane. Also, contract tracing identified cases spread one superspreader infected people 14 ft away airflow involved enclosed space (restaurant AC). COVID spread air, droplets previously claimed. plane enclosed space air movement cabin. might great HVAC filters air still passing multiple passengers, breathing, filtered. 

TL;DR: big traveler, place. Used fly many times year. getting plane think either. idea bad swine flu was.. objective sign good last administration preventing spread I've disagreement people usually leads nowhere agree disagree. using whatever studies/papers/anecdotes find, picking scary pieces out, running gospel. Like said, need waste cycles trying make thing worse is.

Be safe. Yep. fly cross country American last week. mask policy trash. 

They mandatory except eat drink meant woman next worked granola bar hour went unmasked. mattered sat nose whole time. 

Or maybe fact delayed us gate, seats, hour half, waiting bags pretzels hand out. 

I don’t know hyper sensitive flown lot usually pick people never flown don’t often. felt like many people acted like never flown before. 

Fuck flying. Work fire want. won’t going anywhere. duration immunity entirely speculative; may lifelong, may six months. clue figure without EITHER waiting, months human experimentation determine viral dose, combined antibody decay curves.

Either way, temporary immunity vaccine would permit us return normal lives wiping active outbreak, re-vaccinating needed catch we're worried happening again. US Wuhan Y'all! someone start flying twice week every week next month super excited. It’s almost like know happens place**s** went it. 

What people charge expect happen? seriously think cases keep increasing without raising demand hospital resources? perceive hospital resources infinite? believe death rate stay hospital resources stretched thin standards care lowered / triage systems put place? 

I many fucking questions. Eagles grounded oh yes.... waay high.... especially governor pushing businesses running mostly nothing happening, masks mandate (stupid crazy) schools person..... right anything say it, ironically states (poor, rural areas) need most. southern Republican states catch (soon) hope tired Russian bot talking point end. best part excuse since saw happened NY decided NOTHING anyways.

I'm sure initial lockdown saved lives, I'm also sure end costing us far lives people resist lockdown far need.

We check every often progression across US. See coming terms reality looks like.  thought interesting probably change construct future masks. 

I still think mask likely better mask. buy masks unsafe short term, though people work environments required probably get efficient breaks effort made get comfortable masks work better.

Move, save 6 slices seems like lot even grandma. grandma dies means inheritance them. disagree, personal experience shown apartment lots windows planned cross draft better AC circumstances. previous apartment AC unit window, we’d leave full time summer barely made difference. current apartment AC, 2x windows, warmer climate, stays noticeably cooler apartment crappy AC did. I’ve also opportunity visit stay older houses years, ones built breezeway design, make enough difference used heat feels downright cool inside comparison. 

Human beings handle warm environments, us used AC can’t handle real heat. say someone spent lot time working kitchens, normal summer heat seems breezy. surprise. 3M published technical bulletin March 20 indicating damage 60 degrees C. autoclave operates double temperature masks (in Europe) required withstand 70C 24 hours. sure 3M's can't withstand temperature. make money pay everything goes rental property, including limited to, time away duties, expenses appliances, expenses maintain property, expenses pay mortgage, utilities, expenses pay wear tear, air conditioning, etc. can't make money rent, required provide services? pandemic hitting everyone. make enough live renting someone even multiple people certainly make enough replace even minimum wage job work half-time due expenses maintain property alone. landlords saints, true, requiring rent right mouths feed make scum. Right, know received last treatment, type treatment was, still is? think mentioned comment. US shut way early.

What think could done this? Diseases spread like wildfire exponential fashion. 10 cases today 100 cases 2 week, 1,000 cases month after, 10,000 six weeks line, 100,000 two months. understand 10 case side definitely ***feels*** like overreaction, they're far removed control situation 10,000 cases more. could governor seat given little information way back March early April?

I would also bet ego, definite divergence philosophy US. extremes, people prefer Swedish approach, people prefer approach like New Zealand. took completely opposite approaches way implement simultaneously, even remove ego situation.  Austin, New Orleans.

These places show number raw cases they're smaller cities, Travis County per capita confirmed cases Harris County. think fair point say basicaly affect kids much. think shitty people saying old people ones likely die, worried. clue long-tern affects are. dying severe symptoms mean health important everyone else's. 

We know people (younger people) issues respiratory issues (or death). Neurological issues blood clots two common ones I've seen. knows could even younger children us clue it. teachers kids risk, kids' families they're bringing home to, people families going interact with, on. 

I understand point less severe dangerous kids, personally think that's mindset get rid of. virus needs taken 100% seriously regards people ages, life health, even barely affected them. kind investigation possibly needed? Watch video. Investigation over. Yep, that's posted similarly threads actually. wanted see would happen hospitals US LET workers bring masks wear masks home. even preferences hospital overlords paper pushers.

You math. Yeah, also thought super fast. SF luckily held back never got point, even planning indoor dining seemed premature. People enjoy different shit you. That’s say hold event, bet listed hobbies could find one doesn’t make sense me.

So p100 mask way better everyone's cotton mask enough. worried wearing mask. probably knows stuff, going pretend everyone knows thing agree you...DESPITE 100% WRONG. cotton masks form fitting create vacuum seal around skin. could wear mask flu, cough hard enough enough times viruses droplets, get airborne. focus washing hands soap water eating healthier stress, lack sleep, poor nutrition hygiene habits, etc harm regardless. Hahahahah, laughing got hella upvotes thanks comment we're massacred Florida thread almost comment Getting intubated-which might need attend party right get COVID. people training possible fate. Seriously, mind blown number people can’t grasp concept back Florida

FIFY DeVos Umbridge Trump's Voldemort. He's trying body count ""The future Alpacas!"" - Nicolas Cage, Color Space is.  too, take small mental reprieve every contemplate one silver lining, hope seriously take edge worst climate change species extinction. Schools still providing meals kids summer. Handle childcare however they're handling right now. combat detrimental effects social distance right getting done sooner like majority countries done. reinfection real, continue vaccines? fact nothing do, return normal suffer it. Facts care feelings.

P.S Wear mask wash hands. CDC directly. Deaths Covid19 pneumonia things still actually closed NY? Still lockdown? Right, look numbers, Biden neck neck Trump, recently showing 5 point lead UT Tyler's poll. See details: trust 19% undecided though, likely flip state red comes time vote unfortunately. Honestly election eternity away considering everything happening right now, we'll see evolves. It’s like since least... forever. also thought election proved country moving forward ""post-racial harmony"" 

Straw man. People thought progress, sure, was.  nobody tried make argument healed divides.  People could see subculture open hostility toward Obama entire time went beyond politics. average American see issues exist, want anything change them.

Be careful assuming know Average American thinks.  

If guess general sense wanting things improve mostly feeling powerless anything real it.

Also definition “improve” would mean varies widely. explain American culture is. 

I’m playing semantic games. I’m literally stating isn’t one dominant majority culture.

Even meant “white America” pretty obvious heavily split least two major camps even gross oversimplification. 

Sure, foreign eye pick “themes” probably pretty shallow observations.  don’t presume expert French culture Even though know language visited couple times. issues happening United States. exist within global neighborhood try distance us from.

I think you’ve read lot mal-intent originally said. 

It’s deflection warn gleeful German finger-pointers serious shit deal themselves. Especially Germany de facto leader EU Brexit. 

It’s fine feel schadenfreude, especially shitty Trump treated Merkel, shouldn’t feel comfortable. 

Obviously US long-standing issues. Never said don’t even remotely implied it. 

Where seem differ I’m optimistic exposing issues weaknesses helps get solved. 

I see Trump failure, sure, spectacular failure also woken lot people real bad leadership looks like. still groups still quietly pacified several issues. 

I’d warn pointing fingers. may woke issues close home guarantee also “silently pacified” issues periphery.

Everyone causes they’re deeply concerned about. Uhh, yeah weather shit. sun barely out, raining lot. temperature. Often times it'll 15+, cloudy (and rainy). July weather south Sweden quite bad, even Swedish summer standards.

You want reference? went lake friends, 3 weeks ago. agreed go next time sunny warm outside. gone yet absolutely not. We're psycho bully class likes show knives guns collection. 

All sane people worried big things escalate. malicious purposeful slaughter. mean, ignorance blatant disregard health safety citizens wonders cutting immigration. tl;dr 

**They wore fucking masks** contact trace, testing early aggressively, catch many infections spread people. test even asymptomatic people came contact positive, even asymptomatic person.

So say one persons comes hospital symptoms tests positive covid. test everyone person came contact last week regardless symptoms. test everyone people came contact last week, time. Let's say person came contact 20 people last week. end testing 20\*20 = 400 people one person hospital. group 400, might find 10 people (2.5%) tests positive without symptoms. test everyone 10 people came contact with. 200 tests. total, test 600 people one person went hospital. find symptomatic person, test 2 layers deep sure catch everyone. Vietnam zero covid deaths people chance infected tested got bad enough go hospital. 

However, strategy works test contact trace positive people population. infection already wide spread 15% people rather 2.5%. end test way people. group 400 people, end 1200 people test. 1200 people, get positive results. number test scales exponentially soon becomes untenable infection already taken hold population. US tested cases Vietnam, end fewer confirmed cases, massively larger death counts. 

Vietnam also sent travelers foreign countries quarantine centers two weeks they're allowed go out, similar Wuhan evacuees sent army base California quarantine. always outrageous examples denial stupidity go viral giving illusion bigger problem really is.

It awakening people someone immediate circle gets really sick even dies. happens familiar local politicians local celebrities. think many people clinging ""*it's flu*"" ""*numbers faked election*"". denial scary.

At least that's believe.

But completely correct fast enough. Using masks preventative measure would much efficient, would saved many lives. But, going do? ╮(╯ _╰ )╭ Nothingburger trump 2020 COVID acts fast man... think human beings ever meant experience level control many aspects, emotionally physically, today.  Correct! makes sense. money home school. Oki stick it. 

Drop late march due lovely weather Stockholm. Got it.

People Roaming parks Stockholm en mass. 

A snaps lively 3-5 C Stockholm late funny :)

It seems reasonable summer drops R value. mean case flue. 

But need drop claim march Stockholm outdoorsy. year certainly even less so. 

Can accept truth still difficult? it’s actually opposite. governments encouraging hospitals report covid deaths pneumonia deaths keep numbers low reopen.

in oklahoma we’ve 1,400 “pneumonia” deaths year compared 700 year last 5 years. Yup. Selfish assholes absolutely correct! entire American economy built around individualism. whatever takes make money individual! Community health damned. really want visit over. That's neighbor. happen me. number coronavirus cases? Hell yeah! /s TLDR: wore masks took prudent precautions since midst global pandemic. Idaho great job back Mar/Apr closing week &amp; NY, postponing/cancelling several large events, outfitting stores w/plexiglass &amp; social distancing plans. lasted May, staying home &amp; keeping numbers low ... 

Then Memorial Day ""Stage 3"" bars/restaurants reopening happened exact time, people threw basic precautions window &amp; stopped giving shit. 

The past week masks Boise (thanks mayor's order), still lots people wear outdoors. Outlying ""cities"" still part Boise metro area separate rules &amp; mask mandates, people commute routinely erasing benefits. No, personal accounts many did. evidence Ivy personnel underperforming. 

And simply used phrase ""high quality"". higher quality? 4-500% higher quality educations? 

There students bottom 50% income families Berkely alone compared ivies. implying time takes someone die \~2 months? Due lockdown I'd say maybe get tested possible Oh entire executive team reached via zoom, safety convenience course  Let's real. Even dying they'd still think hoax. shitty window AC kind AC article mentioning regardless, since conditioning outside air instead recirculating/conditioning cooler air. gripes AC makes sense since window AC cool whole apartment well, room.

Window ACs massively inefficient compared central HVAC system. current apartment AC, 2x windows, warmer climate

That aside.. locales comparing?  Yes. Exactly this. Cuomo overall average best. fucking shame people say compared rest country great job got call contact tracer possible exposure 10 days ago noticed symptoms. go get tested anyway? Hope someone quick access info point - what's highest rate/100,000 population within US world seen far? nearly counties 400+/100,000 wondering compares worst-hit places depends upon definition collapse. people dying streets... No. people receiving less regular standard care... Absolutely consider fact DNA manipulated without leaving traces behind, article lied about? good point, teachers strike actually resigned once, would totally force state's hand would keep schools closed hire back teachers later.  Yup. I'm getting brunch friends I'm getting something I'd make myself, I'm getting Irish Benedict Belgian waffles bottomless mango-tangerine mimosas wash fatty, decadent goodness down.


Not something often, damn like brunch inawhile. Won’t getting good luck get shot heat moment actively running someone knife, that's you. happened really ambiguous. trying get her, think would done successful, stabbed guy? example public stupidity sociopathy, possibly one mental illness, good example brutality videos cops shooting people back.

If lady, guarantee would shot too. think though, major contributors standard vaccine timeline lack volunteers funding, plenty right Ah, servant waits master baits. public health? no. crazies mingle drink together. parties etc etc etc. masks. public health going stop stupid crazies gov. Yeah cause one thing kids good at, following rules. go again, spreading fake news knew something don't. Please provide source voter fraud arrests. goggled find it. saw trivial things like out-of-state votes, less 200 total. There's evidence voter fraud ever affected outcome vote-by-mail election Washington state. 

Every resident gets one ballot, signatures checked, double-check online vote correctly cast, system keeps improving. 

People convenient voting people know side win without voter suppression, that's simply pathetic. someone works hospital won’t let work home (only outbound calls, oddly enough), ALSO HIV.... I’m kinda weighing job life now.... Getting serious tastes, honestly.. Yeah. one everything right. cloud confusion early on. people really deserve criticism ones ignored learnings early days ignored science stupid shit sure need numbers-it’s obviously money. it’s like they’re going trouble surviving, invested think Disney+ going really valuable eventually parks recover. it’s like Disney $50B added value, even take year two. 45 patients aged 18-55 Phase 1 (results released) 600 Phase 2 (300 18-55, 300 55+) (results yet released).

Results: forgot everyday man people - Tucker Carlson, Trust fund heir Swanson fortune. sucks Chicago issues 14 day quarantine people coming many southern states, point going back fourth since I'll quarantine apartment Chicago.  many medical clinics NYC get test result 48 hours, instead quarantine. results come back positive, GTFO. CDC also reporting ""pneumonia"" deaths stupid! fucking COVID, bury head sand say ""the gays"" ""socialism"" whatever dumb fucks want attribute to, COVID deaths! don’t herd immunity Spain. don’t anywhere. Herd immunity impossible without vaccines. want. think people see CDC don’t read sort United States tag miss it. happened one given India August 15th? felt bit guinea pig situation, worked would know create it. Misleading headline. means we’ll need booster shots, boo hoo appointment every 6 months year quick shot, travesty! always own. came later tool whatever credit could find success cases. Good news? arent reporting anymore or? /s Polis mixed bag.  actually going close schools back March, Denver Boulder districts (who majority COs school population) closed Polis hemmed hawed, basically shamed it.  

Polis also refuses issue kind mask requirement, predictably looney tunes red districts even around front range trumpeting require masks anywhere.  

I like many ways, CO really leads stronger leadership face complete leadership vacuum federal level. People keep saying that, find confirmation 77 yo killed? article could find stable condition hospital. wait October. big fall ""spike"" then. say October take spread schools onto parents teachers, janitors, bus drivers. give us least month think everything fine kids school let guard more. Well put, yeah. Thank you. one yesterday 96%, normally me. 100 percent right AccuJack way wrong. I'm frustrated reading it. parents teachers? people interface kids most? first year I've ever gotten flu vaccine I've never actually caught flu before. mum never vaccine either flu life, teenager. people seem get lot, though. maybe get colds think flu. Smort! 

I assume everyone joking time silly happy! 

Eventually even self imposed ignorance bliss! Thank much reply. looks pathetic angry time mean, drove Northern California first weekend BLM protests, pressure open nothing fucking closed begin with. saw 1 mask total across like four towns. Revoke prize grounds idiocy! ""but one else family got sick""

""but cancer""

""but heart weak""

Etc think laws include element intent. Cuomo acted advice experts medicine public health. DeSantis acted, intentionally, contrary advice experts medicine public health. 132 single day award disingenuous argument day goes to... watch entire 47 minutes pop comment disagree? Dr, Scientist, Public Health official information expertise discredit Doctor? archive [http://archive.is/eA1oE](http://archive.is/eA1oE) Jesus hated black people Mexicans, right? saying something things HIV virus spreads specific way. Imagine airborne like scov2 virus \^ This!  Thank response. saturation test yesterday 96%. California south you? haha It’s also constitutional president declare “national emergency” whim start reappropriating funds stupid border wall Congress explicitly refused fund. And, know, children cages evil atrocities fall news cycle next atrocity takes place. 

Somehow whole system looked way stuff. can’t look way executive order would save lives instead create concentration camps children? always think TRUE blasphemy people substitute God. 

When invoke authority (""His name"") rule stance actually wants (""in vain""). 

 
Jesus called Pharisees ""brood vipers"" ""laid burden on"" people could meet, claiming God's demand them. yet demands drove away God purposes. 

(If I'm remembering right, one examples allowed people give financial support due elderly parents—""honor mother father, days may long land...""--to church instead, still count ""following God's word."")=

I try cautious say ""I think God would want..."" say I'm sure Son God would die agony sinners, knowing would never follow him, would approve one followers refusing help around people's sin.

What would Jesus do? Let's look did: ""While yet sinners, Christ died us."" think huge stretch extrapolate could wear mask even benefits people use Lord's name oath. defending US title written bullshit. meant encourage US bashing productive all. catapulted back across border. opening schools, age factor. plenty studies suggest children fewer receptors virus, etc. literally different biology. lunitic goes 77 yo man? true, though. Lives Matter protests cause uptick covid-19 Lives Matter protests may slowed overall spread coronavirus Denver cities, new study test results show protesters caught Lives Matter protests led spike coronavirus cases, research — Protests — Causing Spikes Coronavirus

Being outside wearing masks makes big difference Meanwhile California can’t get together OC voted 4-1 open schools face mask requirements 🙄 Gotta starve beast. attribute gone 75 years since significant change daily life.

People denial current state affairs want return normalcy 

I want government given refuses fight virus ""The US recorded cases *some* countries combined"" sounds boring title post, means same... especially since says nothing value really. Places people likely cases, that's statistics.

Go cases 100'000 compare murder rate 100'000, give clickbaity title, that's going for, time giving useful information.

Even kids ""superspreaders"" countries reopened schools significantly less infection rates US, even many countries still schools closed. sample size phase one testing laughably small reason optimistic vaccine passes it. Stop scientifically illiterate optimism let know one passes phase 30,000+ participants. Trumps putting numbers pocket Better bury data, dear. Yes. Socialization human interaction absolutely crucial stages development.

Yeah, heard guys got RCV passed. ugly I’d wearing mask time left house silution raging fire burning house? family higher ups education Philly area, discussed. rationale really matter split school, can't cleaned correctly testing good enough otherwise. 

Temperature checks shit. I've read high 30% 70% certain neighborhoods section NYC. rate elsewhere apparently lower. patently false.

Canada thorough comprehensive immunization program everyone, despite even Canada anti-vaxxers, people smart enough vaccinate, do.  
I mean rude, call bullshit. Seriously year protect kids community going negatively impact them. really cared much education, they'd planned implement fully online learning assure kids still stay engaged learning pandemic. They'd also education budgets probably triple actually are. going lie, say nothing all. Intelligent people* key reopening anything within US. Would know whether better info killed ?

Mah boy Trump told me! least could party several weeks. worth cough lungs out.   get point we're talking terrorism hostile nations like NK Nazi Germany... virus consciousness. _not impressed_. Great question, there’s leave behind regard possessions. example, resuscitate orders authorized make difficult decisions behalf find position “cannot execute will”. 

It best people leave behind decide things can. Otherwise, people love lose you, may argue decisions made well authority choose can’t yourself.  why? send back came from. Online classes taken US. online. question t-cells cold type coronviruses. provide immunity virus?  grantedly small study demonstrated people (adults children) get cold-virus once. 

So what's going t-cells? (whoever answers, please translate Stupid may understand) smaller crowds fewer imbeciles boring dystopia.. Ban him. could use nice long walks anyways. Actually, think based official estimate numbers antibody study results. recall correctly, revised death counts added 1290 ""probable"" deaths day two released Wuhan antibody test results. want numbers less line up, lot ways define ""probable"". Yeah AZ current hospitalizations double 26 days ago. week ago doubled 19 days ago. growth slowing. metric used governors NJ NY briefings show fast epidemic growing, it’s ironically number want see go up, Florida become trumps asshole..I'm I'm 80% sure florida blue coming election. may wrong. 1) including citations doesn’t make source good. taught middle school.

Canadian spouse failed quarantine upon entry Canada. suspect many license plates people seeing getting worked Canadian citizens living US. means closing loopholes, can't help wonder much anti-American frenzy based actual incidents.

Citizens always allowed return home. charged failure quarantine, entitled entry Canada. like father like son, can't type much more. mean would hope so, far know, government agency officially signed endorsed one test ""accurate""   ""dear god, thank fuck country leadership"" Basically, yup. flu seasons numbers also based estimates covid deaths right? late boomer, meant main boomers, 65+ OK Karen. Let's sue someone else completely incompetent. zero factual data waiting go outside  Never mind mistake tired dunno thought july 8 Happy baby recovered, hope immune! week two floyd protests front page r/conservative literally mugshots black people arrested random unrelated crimes.

I wonder conservatism. 🧐 one sliver insanity happening around here. immune reason made statement wrong, kept proving wrong stubborn admit wave off. exactly going define spike? agree objective measurement want this. ever say that? said system place help TRULY cannot work.

Like teachers. Unless course okay sending deaths. I'm not, seems like are. could say humans dogs. Yup. Neoliberalism. Destroying education name profit. Yes, it’s called completely negligent  think number one factor sociopaths discouraging mask wearing, especially indoors store.  US laughing every country US long time. every US citizen, no, collectively US always taken approach good US good US well, tough teats anyone else uses power (or threatens it) make point.

As soon another country dares take similar steps borders may somehow impact US it’s citizens get veiled threats “you better careful (the US) may throw back later”. Even another country taking steps best - things US everyday even costs countries greatly - Americans can’t help remind everyone else “power”.

It’s time others stopped worrying US “laugh” them. one laughing appalling response US failure protect citizens, don’t laugh deaths lives changed forever, also can’t help say “well, surprised?”. zombie apocalypse begins. YES!!! We've started 5 year old practice wearing mask completely agree statement. Unfortunately think people made minds kids wear without even trying giving time adjust wearing them. no-shits actual IRL communist, state 100% certainty virus emphatically doing. completely flies face principles, stupid besides bioweapons *always* backfire. Already peer reviewed, neutralizing anti bodies four fold higher recovered patients, good safety far, feel happy I'm getting really tired medical condition bullshit.

Everyone hospital gets mask. exceptions. Unless intubated expected wear one. Fair enough government part. 
Every parent know wants opposite though. willing risk children sending back safe enough. never bad time south. fact, I’ve never shit trip United States. way know. many variables moment. Hopefully get clarity nation wide game plan near future. Unfortunately you, ain't blasphemer who's gonna get struck God this. love clicks! :-( making claims, believe current situation virus China? Well, yeah. ago, saw posts claiming Florida lying cases.

Also numbers always wrong anyway whole pandemic testing even close enough. experts say around 7-8% US infected, days ago... honest, don’t know trust Russia’s Brazil’s reported numbers... again, don’t trust reported numbers. US definitely higher. california.. property taxes, mortgages, etc.  #thisisAmerica oh  Anti-vaxxers spent hours reading blogs link back forth one another think ""I know doctors!""

Also, pollution crematoria increased significantly Unbelievable. flagrant disrespect military makes awe still support there. Probably butt hurt. bothers people use little bit truth glossing facts.

California shut things early avoided bad early spike... things going poorly try open people take measures seriously feel like real threat. Remember conservative post woman stated would ""put grandmother woodchipper bowed government tyranny (wearing mask)?""

Those morons dealing with, situation improve even Trump afraid nutjobs enabled.

Plus, I'm sure reopening much larger impact increase cases protests did. totally different going bar shoulder shoulder others refuse wear masks. common sense really, good job proactive. realize solution requires heavy doses force keep said undesirables out. Sure vaccine technically ""forced"" forcing something else instead. thread comparing US tons 3rd world countries.

some parts world shut down. others pretended shut down.

if parts affected places shut whole thing would already. Openly socialist democrat countries like Norway, Finland France well reopening economy phase infection largely control. shithole countries like US Brazil worship incompetent autocrats situation gone completely control.

You need apostrophe here, opening single-quotation mark. Send us preteen English textbooks! Great news Moderna anticipate 5 BILLION profits this! always respected Fauci, LOVE Fauci 2.0. He's stopped biting tongue walking eggshells. He's going tell like give AF anymore. 

I think T-man really going regret taking pot shots Fauci.   God bless academia / researchers &lt;3 &lt;3 literally however want ways protest marches.

And things listed arguably accomplish more. Okay please read article next time..I'll send article next time Yes discrepancies different counters. think cut different points day. noticed worldometer NYT numbers exactly match fairly close day. Thanks civil reply hope great day! going say wrong. still right. mom boomer I'm 26 brother 28 children. don't. never said was, dont agree reopening country doing. comment mentioned teachers Texas make less Target worker.

They don't.

I dont know train thought coming from, commenting exclusively teachers paid better states. 10M people, it’s less per capita AZ’s totals today. COVID, Eagles fans worst. heard. Awesome! Uhhhh. someone frequents protests, people attendance **far** likely wearing masks I’ve encountered stores daily life. put one valves lips try sucking air exclusively valve. try blowing air valve. 

The valve mask blocks breathing air let air escape. (I dont know mask).

Doctors say ""they work"" concerned policy. *you* sick, masks work protect others. know I've careful, I'm concerning staying well leaving house twice week. get sick, ability spread covid limited. main concern avoid getting it, masks do. also avoid fogging glasses getting real fucking annoying. exactly schools can’t open safely. cost many parents lives child lost entire world instead year schooling. Ohioan, profusely apologize. guy dumbass. ""oh no"" Haha, get it. sure would shock anybody rest California seeing spike cases since end June *the entire state* started open back up. like people live Tesla, go home, go stores, go bars, get sick.

Considering you’re expert matter, come beat me? hit nail head barred entry. take Americans property Canada getting deported barred entry -- even years -- behavior would change. could seen coming? WHO? Defending man 30k deaths hands true idiot. mean, present proof parties take place

What's proof Vampires dont exist? think smart cautious. search polio vaccine, children died clinical trials vaccine Salk's version.  

If reading vaccine non-scientific journal, like random news article, idea quality vaccine they're describing. 

I'm ready socially distance FOREVER lol Yikes blows. won't

I'm sorry will. fact. we'd done right first time we'd opening like Europe process shutting cause economic pain. re-open soon we'll even economic pain. ignore well suffer economic need diverse set experts, virus impacts many aspects lives

It's funny experts expertise agree. sure let's keep trying find one dumb enough agree armchair sound like raving jackass. prescription eat box dicks boomer.

I'm millennial care opinion is, either stay fuck home reopen later keep half measures satisfy nitwits next years. choice. Get mad people following science, protesters. Huh, really interesting, idea issue Depopulation? Cull old, poor, sick. highest dose, moving forward with. 
What people reading bad? subreddit fucking buzzkill good news. back show us way Solution: kids Bars. assuage concern antibodies:

Antibodies meant float around blood willy-nilly rest time. supposed recycled body come infection. big thing determines long term immunity T-cells, special immune system cells produce antibodies desparately need fight infections. closest cousin SARS-CoV-1, first SARS virus, presence T-cells still recovered patients 4-10 YEARS infection. I'll get source sars claim momentarily, source T-cell vs antibodies comes father-in-law's medical doctorate ungrad microbiology Ok troll :) underfunding... misallocation mismanagement. 

We built system works great grant money public funding.  

It work crisis.  knew shortcoming... collect amount money anything name public health. Well, plus proof people treatment group developing right antibodies right levels (and caught virus). ""Coronavirus deadly, die yet. Stay alive make sure vote! P.S. Inject Llama juice""  didn’t even read header image 😂 possible treatment changes like mention remdesivir notable impact. However widespread infection rates Florida Texas, large populations, already reaching ICU capacity, may reach similar death rates. Especially considering Florida's extensive retirement communities older population. stopped reading new deaths

WEEEEEEEEWWWW GUYS many issues people act like can't solve countries have.

This standard US attitude seems. Health care, criminal justice prison reform, gun control, workers rights, education... Lol ""agree""

More like Trudeau told Trump nasty ass citizens arent allowed in. conservative plan since day one. since electoral college. true here. ""9th time July"" 

It's July 14th Vaccines obviously wonderful innovation I'm definitely denying success eradicating really terrible diseases.

I think taking ""antifascist"" approach antivaxers effective. antivax mentality may ultimately illogical, grounded logical concerns. difficult impossible dislodge someone's beliefs tackling logical concerns.  People work go school Canada allowed across people want visit direct family long stay 15 days self isolate. Also test people presymptomatic Same. Healthy guy. 40. Go running blah blah. still makes nervous there’s chance health means nothing. Even worse live Hailey virus over. Sick this. 'they' ? Also aware experts theorize official death toll higher due people dying home, rise Bronchitis Flu deaths, etc?  NYC healthcare system never collapsed peak

There literally trucks full cadavers outside every hospital people digging mass graves NYC yea, whatever. people take wrong way. “Look, NYC fine now. Covid19 isn’t bad.”  

They forget NYC order make this. TMC said anything? keep projecting image barely leveraging tons surge capacity have. bullshit?  K cool, byeeeeee games fans would attendance...unless decide make would distance fans stands. Still good idea fact cases stayed per day month astonishing

100%. understand either. live much north might well south snow. give idea, Trump held rally 2016. New York.

About month half ago predicted huge spike reopened. happen, things immediately tapered back lockdown-level infection rates. 

It make sense knowing seriously people around taking this. county also stopped reporting daily infection rates website get information Facebook. Like 85% ish population, lol. Exactly, 4 stitches ER, wanted give X- Ray's declined. Total cost visit 4 stitches one shot 1700 dollars. Waiting DeSantis sign executive order forcing schools open... Michigan recently instated [Executive Order requiring people wear masks inside public spaces. hope new flu strain immediate vaccine. Umm, Beto O’Rourke wasn’t nobody. Republican can’t win without cheating. Districts gerrymandered polling places designed exclude minorities. think people also tend overlook incidence false-negative results COVID-19 tests. quite common probability false-negative result double-digits, depending infection cycle test administered. people experiencing long infection quiescent phase, perhaps tests given period (like given early on) likely show false-negative result. Hey hey, dumbest *most self absorbed* motherfuckers planet. Meanwhile grandpa could care less climate change impact children. I'll note county executive refused mandate mask order last night council meeting.. outbreak among county employees county offices closing going back work home anything. line ""personal responsibility"". Mean county government showing control. can't even prevent outbreaks buildings among employees. (40+ cases among county employees MANY tests pending) Orlando's fault allowing amusement parks open, Northerner's fault visiting! Feeling safe important safe? going kids unknowingly bring virus school pass on. kills teacher family member class mate students deal knowing one spread it. heavily manipulating numbers?

I'm saying Covid minor cold, health impact far roughly equivalent normal influenza. nowhere close Spanish flu many (me included) feared back February. Obviously partially lockdown preventive measures normally take every winter. Fake news. 

Found swedish Trump.  RemindMe! 1 month still amounts thing; laughable response Governor Abbot. But, thank nuanced explanation. always important consider every facet situation. This. I’m pediatrics clinic seeing normal patient volume need create conspiracy see sick kids top majority covid kids zero mild symptoms wouldn’t even lead visit real problem asymptomatic carriers give teachers grandparents capitalism bad Medicare way bernie savior Mississippi buttloads heavy industry global trade.

Florida major tourism destination rest US.

California one largest economies world. would 5th largest economy world country, larger India. countries stupid.

I meant dictatorship/communism perspective. fact United States trying control information manipulate public data insane. side effects anti-vax people? Oh no, states sending - i.e. forcing - kids teachers back school. 
well suppose know anything candidates ahead time
if want vote free bias matters. informs decision making. don’t agree doesn’t make less true. want another 30 days eh. 

Sure go ahead.

Edit

No wish people wouldn’t lie push political narrative. see don’t take corona seriously know seriously life altering effects even survive. Maybe brought cleaning crew clean departed one left common surface. will....someday... someday soon, like someday later  title misleading. read statement yourself, worth noting ends on:

Yes - community weigh pros cons. no, think feds wield federal money carrot stick case. misleading say AAP ""walked back"" previous statement (2). clarification evidence decide, communities treated same.

Further, obviously still early days, clear ""Children less commonly affected SARS-CoV-2"" (3) documented ""The majority children infected novel CoVs reported thus far documented household contact, often showing symptoms them, suggesting possibility children important reservoir novel CoVs."" (3)

So good chance vaccine immunity last good while. Trump blinked. pissing fat cats. Lmfao vulnerable already killed  Pump doc, I’m ready go Oh STFU, ignorant twat. see meme says can’t even begin comprehend understanding people take seriously.

Whether SPE needed establish debatable. Without saying anything study's participants (because know anything rest life) think well-understood sadistic, cruel, even evil people perfectly capable masquerading upstanding citizens (e.g., normal college students).

What's questionable converse. know bad people (or, least, people nudged bad things) seem normal. Decades research psychopaths show that. mean ostensibly normal people pushed evil? necessarily. thought Lombardy's high IFR large population elderly people. title bit misleading subtitle accurate. We’re losing battle selfish, undereducated populace doesn’t understand science refuses take simple precautions prevent hospitalizations. abysmal response partly due underfunding public healthcare, largely due corrupt dysfunctional healthcare system designed serve people expensive employer provided health insurance, extremely poor elderly.

I going reply thing : ) Clearly, polly-anna view world believing enough right reasoning help cause people change mind, working. 

We still anti-vaxxers despite mound evidence disproving beliefs. 

We still anti-mask people, despite mound evidence wearing masks help stop spread. 

Peoples personals beliefs, ideologies, outright egotism stop person hearing amount evidence contrary. 

You try, point call are. Morons. Stop coddling them. Better start Europe Asia. already reopened.  anyone link public comments either region NY outbreak? 

Thx advance.  people supposed do? quarantine forever? That's really depressing think would difficult truly prove. We'd need independent observation oversight level have. However, whenever look conspiracy theory, there's basic smell tests come play. stuff stands first glance:

The experience reported hospitals consistent happened currently happening outbreaks countries, including countries national health systems rather for-profit hospitals. 

Tests usually conducted independent labs (at least live) report back provider county. would mean cahooting labs hospitals fake numbers.

The number people would need conspiracy massive. people involved secret, less likely going stay secret.

If someone refuses believe science scientific experts, think there's much convince them. personally, accusations pass smell test, I'm highly skeptical.  mention bunch Republicans want bring jobs back America ""China stole them"" still wears apple products Tuberculosis killed 1.5 million people 2019, overwhelmingly places poor treat properly.

Dr Big Brain told COVID overhyped tuberculosis killed people 2019. wear mask great tuberculosis outbreak 2019, hypocrite. even know say get people put random facebook videos random fucking guy saying infowars tier nonsense international consensus medical experts. deaths lead poisoning related issued criminals. Outdoor transmission: 
I seen combination study masks. Nope. virus overwhelmingly affects poor. Ted Cruz really care poor people die, he's especially going undergo minor inconvenience poor people. sure they're getting 25% late June. 20% mid-April confirmed cases doubled. Even testing caught twice many cases, still 30% infected. probably closer 40% based IFR estimates. Get em made lets go  air much better used 90s so? read major clean effort yielded results brit living Spain avoid destination heavily frequented British tourists. Spain beautiful country many interesting sites visit, yet number brits reach certain threshold, everything goes shite. Seriously comes another country middle pandemic pulls kind stunt?   keep eye EU too, everyone else approves well it’s probably safe That's combat competing force, science. Science something changes slightly time given new information add method testing previous information. people power trying save markets keep people calm lying already solid science flip back truth course people skeptical. called breaking trust, someone lies always little feeling distrust snowball time lied repeatedly. opposite viewpoint solid science besides blatant misunderstanding science first place people replacing understand opinion based understand, seems little. exactly right. testing way knowing widespread community transmission time way control lock down. Lockdown prevented community spread huge sections country.

What's shameful area came lockdown without robust test trace program therefore, clear path prevent community spread. Unfortunately, case country. lol yeah looked clinic normally go can't get tested week even wanted. Whelp. watched last week. Wild. YEEEE HHHAWWW! long don’t play guitar could ask someone else lives take look rather risking people Canada 'feel fine' 40-second clip starts Fauci saying, ""Right now, people walking, there’s reason walking around mask."" said masks provide ""perfect protection"" contracting virus people think. clip ends Fauci saying, ""When think masks, think healthcare providers needing clip left out, instance, one reason Fauci gave Americans wearing mask: ""The masks important someone who’s infected prevent infecting someone cute cut one sentence take context, pretend meant something polygamist 🤫 we'll gladly let people drink Coronas expire! overpriced worth jobs land immediately.

It fair. advocating this. look get result top college degree - networking connections make high price tag absolutely worth actual institution itself. Plus, also ""on brand"" life bc got Harvard/Yale/etc. stamp. 

I'm even saying people go schools idiots many are. always deserved. I'm answering ""is worth it"" question emphatic YES. 

Most professors famous researchers, authors titans reasons teaching - like research say taught Harvard/Yale/Wharton, etc. particularly gifted even invested teaching. they're trying publish research, they're fulfill eccentric hobby, lifelong passion. Say ain't wait 2021: Sequel! wife Canadian. really much vaccines. means go pool first person line get vaccine. fact people looking like go away blows mind. pictures urban hellscape sold already, first paragraph sure would have. also starting get ""Mask Fatigue""... Factory work good requiring masks, every day I'm seeing people wearing chins, pulling talk, stupid stuff. fall, forsee real problem. Look ACTIVE cases though. looked see recover catastrophe. currently less 9k active cases kept low quite awhile wife's theory wont get mask mandate till cases spike due idiots want recall him.  Nope: Remdesivir current treatment. checkpoints. Think much people would flip weren’t allowed enter leave state, based much outrage mask wearing. 

The state recommends/asks people coming high covid case states self isolate 14 days. There’s enforcing here. cannot access site Europe see Thumbmail basically says: ""Hey looks everywhere rural states infected""  absolutely popular support opening anytime soon even wrote MP yesterday keeping closed. Polis met Trump back tune approach changed. Back March telling everyone stay home. flipped right meeting. sure there's really conspiracy odd. anyone know antibody testing cost looked like average? want get antibody testing done however, I'm little hesitant I'm sure expensive typically been. many people understand that, helping employee watching companies ass, get sued. herd immunity idiots

I see lot morons saying, ""we need stop flattening curve get with."" literally, openly, pro-infection. don’t know, Musk pretty weird. might legitimately think everything’s fine go wherever wants. Maybe America learn?

Narrator: Wait 5 years. specify. states ""a positive test"". also said self reported participants. feel bad Walz. He's trying best good job deal anti science idiots impede every turn. imagine wanting right thing assholes block path take KNOW wrong can't change course gets worse.

I'm 18 excuses saw wanting Walz fucking ridiculous. people wanted see friends, party, drink bars nonsense. 

I'm really starting consider people bad people around certainly fun. Zero. guy died approached officer knife, mask. local news station Dallas, North Texas (though whenever hear 'North Texas' personally think panhandle). believe model isn’t much Prius. would open lot people. also shingle solar panel leasing lot better deal current solar company giving us. would switch, we’re stuck lease 20 years. No, actually.  Fair point cases influenza point summer Northern hemisphere, general lying patients diagnosis get money insurance/medicare fraud. US government powerful US insurance industry would *very* interested hospitals so.

In general, excess deaths confirmed covid deaths year. every excess death covid related, reasonable assume many undercounting deaths. also know 30-40% cases asymptomatic relatively unlikely tested, also undercounting cases (probably undercounting cases significantly larger fraction undercount deaths, doubt undercounting amount). Ummm...it's flu season. Flu highly seasonal hits fall/winter.

Remember talk coronaviruses traditionally dieing summer? ones do. I'm imagining Berlin Wall kinda ordeal happening soon Past sophomore year likely happening. Worked someone family member 40's it, still fatigued months later. Good you. must excellent health. surprised many people claim kids completely unable wear them. kids 7 4 we've started ""practicing"" masks. great! Kids adaptable, dont think people giving enough credit.   not.. compared LA IE.. Everything left districts.. mean anything.. Build wall make Americans pay it. gonna say... proven work. germane wrote. speculation OP’s idea virus sits dormant. Nothing know people test negative later positive. point. anecdotal stories isolated cases. It’s non story. actual issue would seen much often....especially high risk jobs. return deny American citizens entry part sovereign nation-state.

If escalates stupid diplomatic issue Trump wants Americans summer vacation god damn hate man. Underlying health exception first place people abusing it. forget Wal-mart's!


It's Michigander thing. supposed travel restrictions high-risk states, enforcement this. 
I traveled upstate NY weekend saw dozens cars southern states, particularly Georgia Florida. ....Maine.... Well... Many us entered field healthcare wanted help people. 


What's happening start curve supposed flattened.


The first ever patient took care hospital student 88 year old man lost mind alcoholism (hepatic encephalopathy). adult daughter (who suffered alcoholism growing up) would get face angrily project trying say hard hearing was. Every time came in, would get angry say kept bothering much thing (taking vitals every 4 hours). time us leave floor, said goodbye thanked letting take care him. 

For moment, cloudy blue eyes turned bright. said me, ""you're leaving? But... want go."" 

It moment knew really meant do. 


If quit exhausted heart (compassion fatigue), we'll die (choosing help many people possible inevitably die virus). time dig Google, clearly remember CDC and, think surgeon general, saying masks help wear them. Yes, prevent run PPE, lie caused loss public trust. longer evolving? it, view? assumed reason parents already flipping shit can't bear thought spending time children. They're used passing onto education system letting raising, means keeping house.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   Lots pediatricians private practices. still holstered, that's always brandishing places. Dude still needs kick junk stupidity though. Really glad got him. happened town face shared social media try ID him. Looks like might worked. adjusted Arizona population would like 300 East Asia countries like Japan, South Korea, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc. told masks **only** protect others? feel like messaging tends west thing we're used masks begin with. Dang sad. year half ago went service trip Panama help bring medical services rural areas country. population high rates underlying conditions like hypertension diabetes prescribed lot medications treat conditions. wish could go back help need most. many wonderful people Panama.  Whether give Trump talking points doesn’t really matter. He’s pro making up. maximum 2 hours domestic travel restrictions decided on? 

Was March? maybe May? 1) get number
2) that’s still fucking large number obviously read I’m critiquing perspective claim. vaccine  That's entirely accurate. ""recovered"" hit tally taken test quarantine up. Many number stays board. Also, assuming 28k die 245k active saying greater 10% mortality rate, doesn't. Safely assume .5 1.5% mortality rate active cases go even look hospitalization #s go want get better estimate. saying person followed number closely NYC. seeding occurred FL near NY even though seeing new case numbers exceed NY. positive test rate pushing 40% extended period time metro area.

Florida great situation right now, all. near situation NYC metro in. everyone needs remember time we, country, started reacting, NYC already fully loaded likely watched midst sickening portion exponential growth. likely missed chance manage virus weeks. NYC area testing many people FL may able save many, many lives via contact tracing, etc. Instead, already far beyond control started initiatives.

I said that, say this. Without appropriate measures taken, explode like everyone fears will. 5 months people tired plays role ability abide rules. far less people looking reasons wear mask socially distance March April. guess that's one way describe mom's basement mentality Europe saw things unfolding Italy.

Will happen here.

That quickly changed though.

The virus don’t care. Curious flu numbers year, would expect gone _significantly_ result lockdown. compare two

Edit: guess flu season ended around time lockdown went place really hard determine publican governor, 5.64 million. words, everybody. came Savannah got stared LOT mask. It’s atrocious gross negligence point. Umm, Beto O’Rourke wasn’t Republican primary. Elon Musk good person. factories worst safety records. fooling anyone, know. Look, something do? would even worse since delegates names public, means people later check social media find announced sick check obituaries least.  herd immunity. policies implemented. Simply put: Covid 0.2% mortality rate young people. gets higher older are, 20% elderly. vaccine simply beat number. trivial vaccine do. Vaccines exist today considered ""too dangerous"" give general population ones like yellow fever, 1 100,000 chance negative side effect. Compare 1 500 chance *dying* covid healthiest among us, decision easy. happening Shout jersey boys, still going strong 💪 Come western Massachusetts, lots hillbillies here, sadly lots trump signs well, confederate flags sprinkled there.  New Jersey. live shore amount state tags coming (cough PA cough) walking around masks generally ignoring guidelines reason Jersey's numbers look even better ask me. 

Jersey still good though. Proud Northeast I've almost every state. Lots cool people, lots shit people.

SC one worst. bad feeling whole time there. study. bold. It’s bold say based experience belligerent people always old white men. great relief yes, failure allow two infected people continue threatened public... case underlying luck.  Haha, intentionally conveyed fact additional commentary.

The moral story: facts seem offensive. Someone could make miraculous placebo medicine claiming cure side effects vaccines cash millions, saying.  go ahead label MAGA's terrorist group? mean, Juggalos considered gang painting faces gathering listening music. this... encouraged supported within MAGA group. do. live Ohio keep repeating myself, go grocery store, virtually everyone see wearing mask.

Then again, live one [8 relatively sane counties could get majority teachers agree authorize strike, think would really take everyone's licenses then? There's teacher shortage already. (From teacher whose district went strike 2019 worry that) Yea hard tell anymore. I’m listening guys initials names like PHD MD. Surely JR! every COVID hot spot world COVID cases pre-dating first confirmed case discovered (genetic evidence Iceland suggests SARS-2 circulating UK early January!).

And course normally week two places enacted real precautions, week two lockdowns started. 

During time millions children undoubtedly exposed, think numbers likely fairly accurate. 

To sure loads adults exposed virus lockdown, really hard imagine children well. events require permits. doesn’t include Eagles games. Honestly, pneumonia almost never written cause death.. Pneumonia usually symptom comes death knell larger issue. light almost here, y’all! Oh I'm 34 still learn shit new thing always every day. Good anyone figure  That's twin brother. happen me. might find like, etsy, maybe even someone makes custom ones Same. We've heard seen countries world. here. care flexing freedom get sick stopping hospitals overflowing depressing economy years come. really liberty - infringing rights make us wear mask, ten times make us wear clothes cover far bodies. Good. ruin Southern Indiana schools open July 29th... soooo... makes cooking much easier! good know. break 500-800 range?! Shit howdy that’s high state 5 million. Kentucky areas probably better rural parts Oregon Washington... Wait, knee fluid shit still going around? remember 30 years ago.

ETA:from recall solution back drink urine magic magnetic bottle. OP. I’m answering question asked since clicking link read article didn’t work you. That's depressing. main focus local media always circles back tourism extremely vital economy here, far virus spreading rapidly, really focusing RIMPAC imo.

There much talk RIMPAC 20,000+ foreigners/mainlanders roaming streets next month families. ever seen person, looks like Mardi Gras. Imagine thousands drunk sailors drinking beer streets allowed go freely base catch Bus travel around island. Oh way, military also exempt wearing masks.

The cherry top none required test negative covid quarantine. That, fact military lying covering infected numbers islands. time military admits infected case gets leaked like Navy guy infected Pearl Harbor gym months ago.

In early April rumor 200+ cluster Hickam. Also, civilian workers required go military homes Schofield. workers given list houses base contain infected family members, homes required wear applicable PPE.

An Air Force friend mine formally briefed early March command began start spreading propaganda friends saying medical Air Force doctors think really bad. said virus already islands since 2019 us already big deal. Basically exact stance Donald Duck has. last time saw friend person Idiocracy mentality absolutely terrifying around."
