That’s actually less severe delta, pure speculation point.   I'm at. buckle up.  Prepare harvest *lower* horn. Since eligible booster, make sense wait data behind current protection towards variant? honestly, worried either way rather wait. Im afraid damn virus, me, family, friends. hospitals getting crowded again, people die even though could prevent getting vaccinated. It’s frustrating would “new appropriate forces” analogy be? Oh hell yes A&amp;C reference, thanks Would like point transposing numbers uncommon, especially among people varying degrees dyslexia; mean OP read article.

Good luck there, everyone. Fuck stop already, Earth remains “as” deadly that’s still bad we’re basically dealing same, worse infections.  people takes vaccine would worthwhile takes day 2 B cells start making anti-bodies I've read. would assume would also change depending health infected. yeap. taking whole world her. believe second shot prepare worst, hope best.

we seen anything like ... hopefully final number comes lower theres confounding factor like half plane part tour group something. thought one knew much yet...will covid like beginning 2020?

No, not. Wuhan shut mid-January, point clear serious. world almost full 2 months prepare pandemic, countries, especially west, less nothing. 

With variants, right, there's much warning already spread far wide. fact, since viruses mutate time, variant *doesn't* spread, worth paying much attention to. here. spreading. recovery might enough ward reinfection. got 37, although internal medicine attending local hospital told still ""young males"" group heart problems booster (below 40). He's planning get booster soon though, 30yo. implausible CNN anyone know point. That's straight fear porn. CNN needs challenged show work here.

I going to, gave warning males age group increased risk heart issues booster? 

25 otherwise healthy. covid year ago also fully vaccinated.   question: I’m vaxed I’m sure others fam well would care? would care?

Personally, it’s it’s still killing people empathy, I’m risk care others well. people suffering effects long covid. it’s impacting medication system meaning (and others) can’t get care required health issues. there’s plenty people world haven’t opportunity get vaccinated yet. It’s possible part reason Omicron developed fact - there’s inverse relationship covid19 mutations vaccinated numbers within population. Point is: there’s plenty reasons vax already defends vast majority strains. 

You’re correct, extent. vaccines aren’t 100% long covid real, debilitating condition. safely assumed variant even immune escape I’m wrong can’t make new vax detects different mutations like day now?

Vaccines don’t detect viruses, prep body recognize them. Moderna released statement saying get new booster developed within 60-90 days. That’s one advantages mRNA technology. Pfizer released statement well, though yet read get lives already? go event, venue restaurant clearly see one cares anymore. place people care put mask protect travel airports. I’ve seen first hand many times.

The fact events held venues, restaurants open, air travel, etc… exactly “getting lives long legitimately “unlax”. 

No one knows. sucks, know. life many others upside known great loss. tell frustration negatively impacted life too, I’m sorry. Sometimes things drastically change circumstances entire generation/s (disease, war, revolutions, etc). almost become “filler” generation, speak, it’s next comes along things get back level normalcy. It’s unfair gets. happen. hope passes isn’t virus significantly less dangerous mutating spread kill. 

It unknown whether Omicron lethal. again, anyone care? Imho yet another flu (put simplistically). I’m tired mask mandates all. one wears em inside think ppl do, don’t bother replying.

I’m sure comparison drawn. Covid19 not, ever been, flu like it. assure everyone tired mask go far say don’t care people vaccinate anymore well. They’re idiots. I’m done giving damn. can’t stop world idiots vaccinate, that’s insane.

I frustrated antivaxxers too, trust me. we’re stopping them. Vaccines enough hinder thing since Delta. likely worse Omicron. measures required well. Also Ebola ugly af. Covid made Americans ugly antivaxxers would lining shots. new African variant NY concerned right now. going take time get spread. problem right still Delta variant, spread NY right holiday weekend. current state Delta falls squarely shoulders unvaccinated. know yet. regions found clusters South Africa much Delta wave. mean kindly please spread conclusions barely data itll spread unnecessary anxiety people. helps skipping letters. Xi, example, used. Travel bans work instead serve disincentivize sharing negative information. CNN said Delta Beta mutations wrapped one. mutations made Delta transmissible, Beta vaccine resistant. said one closer dangerous. keep reading statement understand go many basically becomes regular cold reading fast going help play Go told friend today already US, looked like crazy. Uh huh. Let's wait 3 days revisit sentiment. people stop dumb. Also, people stop saying forever. fair death ultimate liberation. Thank you! Vaccine efficacy already drops significantly 6 months even Delta strain. line boosters. March 2020 measures never implemented Covid variants. least speak U.S probably Canada. idea places like Australia, Austria Germany. another world own. Goodluck Citizens getting shut every variant.  Well built castle two slaves! going do, kick out?!? Well sure random - prompted question?  Thank rapid alert. I’m sorry guys getting sealed grateful head start? live near area w/ first Covid deaths US, surreal tracked strange see land here. wonder one even originated SA? idea would think anyone else would plan someone doesn’t access vaccines unvaccinated. 

That’s doesn’t even make sense.

I’m specifically talking unvaccinated New Yorkers article NY governor. We’ve open access vaccines months months. Absolutely legitimate reason get vaccinated. According anti-vaxxer conversation last week, deaths vaccine 13x higher Covid.

I kept mouth shut walked away one.    want tell though? People want accept answer ""as long takes"" governments forced make arbitrary timelines.

The truth still that, long takes get infections background level like flu is. could 2 months 2 years since virus mutations turning big unknown.  assumptions based known science. 

unvaccinated people likely get Covid, meaning active cases otherwise would be. they're likely spread vaccinated person. change careers become ICU nurse? Us five airports taking direct flights South Africa since November 9th. watched special reading Nu. Seemed like documentary comedy. Honest question: true, lab engineer design corona virus less lethal, transmissible vaccine evasive? spread population. could avoided months lockdown. Omicron planet-sized transformer ate planets. He's basically Galactus. none would discovered without extra testing? I'm speculating here, might mean new variant causes lot asymptomatic cases. would actually really good, may less dangerous.
That would also explain extremely rapid spread seems like contagious virus history, maybe cases discovered people started looking. Orders magnitudes fewer virus. Half world least one dose. extremely myopic view. honestly title specify rich WESTERN countries China handled extremely effectively. west especially US primarily responsible outcomes global south generally prolonged nature pandemic. didn’t test well enough, didn’t contract trace, didn’t China style quarantine ect. top hoarded vaccine protect profit. happened delta happening new strain primarily inability western countries able handle public health crisis effectively. AFAIK there's lot scepticism effectiveness Russia itself.

That yes. conversation 5 minutes ago. 

Interlocutor - vaccines arranged 

I - so, mRNA vaccines, vector, inactivated different 

Interlocutor - difference make, work 

I - decide that? 

The interlocutor - sure it


real conversation adult, alas  mean comment section talking hypothetically, *any* contagious virus/disease. Read room. Right. sensible thing aware wait, sense panicking. think it’s possible make inferences based know virology immunology that’s rigorous testing review. says doesn’t?  know every zombie game ever play usually “this flu” written walls blood everywhere

And everyone keeps relating virus flu, know we’re fucked zombie outbreak Oh cases. looking probably today. everywhere man, everywhere agree you, usage ‘downplays’ far assumptive man says article. It’s curated induce panic. need remember interviews aren’t conducted English.

“Won’t severe epidemic” manipulated “no cause concern”. society collapse already? constant ""will they/won't they"" fucking exhausting  Source tidbit info? know hard, need remember like earlier year news Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta surfacing. Especially Delta. 

We're reacting Omicron way reacted initial reports variants. Nobody remembers 2021's hell roller coaster we've trying survive keep heads water since 2020. 

There wild speculation variants going ""the one"" set us back March 2020 kill us all. probably either but, like variants, need keep heads us science gets done figure we're actually looking at. 

Some people mentioned governments moving faster variants? UK want immediately suspend travel India trade reasons nothing South Africa? back then, US still announcing travel bans days went effect. 

Others mentioned markets react Delta way markets reacing Omicron that's telling bad is. Thing is, markets actually negative reaction. [This Bloomberg talks two Financial Post Fortune can't link Automod.

Just like Mu pronounced Mi Greek letter μ. god damnit feels like never going end US’s response always slow. Trust it’s already begin review “data” don’t think idea yet worse outcomes variant. need wait 2-4 weeks lot people testing positive see hospitalization rates start going up. That’s kinda point advisors lol. (ideally) deep expertise subject elected official probably wouldn’t have. 

What concerns reactions multiple governments — presumably also advised experts — seem rather serious. wanna trust variant isn’t concerning, I’m also wondering there’s wisdom crowd going here. Moderna 100 mcg, Moderna booster 50 mcg, Pfizer 30 mcg, Pfizer kids 10 mcg right enough care vocal enough make rest us think wired ones Another ""both sides"" enlightened centrist trolling...downvote move on. Sharona Yeah we’re Europe right don’t want go back US it’s shit show. Biggest problem 50 individual states acting countries vastly different protocols. think Africa like 5% fully vaccinated. whole continent. One thing I've learned data much data make much sense comparing data throughout pandemic. I've flown COVID go holiday back. Honestly, holiday wonders mental health. Travelling pretty much live pre-Covid, think black white stay home. course abided rules needed to, vaccinated, COVID pass etc. think unreasonable all.   everyone tested negative prior flight, flight, 1/10 turned positive? many would positive days? good job countries closed borders swiftly.

“To summarize, omicron:
- still small sample.
- likely faced pressure escape vaccines.
- found country w cases (not would expect evolving become fit).

What else rest people? picked plane, testing positive yet. takes day two work way system enough test register it. people picked time negative test flight. still extremely worrying, many people caught 24-48 hours flying South Africa - many people spreading it, large percentage passengers test positive? would made much better. Yeah looks like things become extremely good extremely bad. Probably chance extremely bad fingers crossed. Can't wait shore Australia going sight kek Brazilian government decided halt flights southern Africa. Starting Monday, lmao   noticed, unvaccinated people right seem taking sorts unnecessary risks. Looks like war Ukraine on. 2022 maybe worst year. 
It likely vaccines would still effective, much moreso also already gotten infected along vaccination (so called ""hybrid immunity""). ""hybrid"" exposure virus. Specifically, infected coronavirus 2020 immunized mRNA vaccines year. ""Those people amazing responses vaccine,"" says virologist Theodora Hatziioannou Rockefeller University, also helped lead several studies. ""I think best position fight virus. antibodies people's blood even neutralize SARS-CoV-1, first coronavirus, emerged 20 years ago. virus very, different fact, antibodies even able deactivate virus engineered, purpose, highly resistant neutralization. virus contained 20 mutations known prevent SARS-CoV-2 antibodies binding it. Antibodies people vaccinated prior coronavirus infections essentially useless mutant virus. antibodies people ""hybrid immunity"" could neutralize fuck would even work? Rumour control, facts.

I hope shut fuck up. Necron-omicron… gonna need transform hand chainsaw It’s two different tests- + PCR doesn’t always mean current active infection- PCR tests pick recent infections time.

The variant world now. I've reading level-headed takes far, even Health Minister South Africa saying noticed worse outcomes far travel bans premature. Many experts saying travel bans entire countries answer; helping countries get better access distribution vaccines enacting better sense travel policies is. enact policies vaccinated travelers enter country get COVID test within certain amount time entry. That's best path forward.

These types travel bans honestly punish South Africa diligent sequencing good world citizens alerting countries get frustration part. long keep stringent safety measures place, countries really knee-jerk reaction variant know much about. thing already bunch variants continue so. Given COVID stay, freaking every single variant going help. know safety measures work... let's continue instead locking banning travel constantly.

The spreads, times mutate potentially worse forms. likely omicron variant mutated someone weak immune system suffering AIDS, example. Letting virus spread means kind thing likely happen not.

The spreads, opportunities mutate. Letting run wild perfect circumstance create worst form super virus. 

If never measures taken would position now, much higher stack corpses behind us. Vaccines luck ways out. (Luck random mutation becoming dominant maximally contagious worse common cold.) It’s baseless article’s presumptions. thinking Pandemic Legacy season 2 definitely crossed mind. never felt physically ill second dose booster, around relatives complained illness. One tested negative rapid covid test, tell-tale symptoms, another refused get tested, swore possibly it. never seemed catch either had, possible picked asymptomatic infection due vaccination status. use “may” vs “should” helps infection necessary care severe cases. must try bidet. Sadly true, least know blame on. Anyone around anti-vax. Make note gets them. survive know avoid. pretty sure already here. That's actually I'm guessing too! 

It three mutations predicted vitro lead strong ACE2 receptor binding though, could explain higher transmissibility possibly. given mutations know grant good amount antibody evasion, I'm guessing that's bulk advantage (and thing think confidence true, far mutation effect goes). 
It's good news sure that's case-- means new vaccine variant would bring world back place facing Delta moment smallest, easiest thing wearing masks. can’t even explains lot current situation. people watching way much CNN. J&amp;J Moderna Pfizer exact spike protein. Yeah exactly! original covid genome sequenced, Moderna able create vaccine 2 days. reason didn’t get till year later multi phased testing approach. would think FDA would allow mrna companies skip directly phase 2 testing since delivery vector dosage would stay same. probably already is. Even people haven’t South Africa already tested positive new variant. I'm 100% little 48 hours booster. Something peculiar little funny seems effect vaccine experienced second dose muscle twitches. second dose, got twitching muscle arm lasted couple weeks. twitching finger lol. Well that's easy one. omega truly 'the end' there'll nobody around buy watches. thing! first two shots gave sore arm slight fever. third one felt like dying: chills, whole body ached, lethargic, lymph node swelling. side effects 4-6 hours. felt fine morning, sore arm anything. making baseless presumptions 5% number 1) 'people' say that, professionals professors taught entire life devoted lives virology. what's taught university college pattern that's observes.. credentials weigh something community acceptance?

2) base viruses always behaved. variants less infectious, less deadly. 20 years, trend less deadly infectious.   Notice wording ""Texas spends 7bn improving existing healthcare workers benefits, pay, working conditions"" halfway real problem. 

People leaving profession looking prospect another year without raise due cancelled outpatient procedures (remember that's two years row now), another increase health insurance costs loss fringe benefits ($60 increase month family plan year), another year lean staffing satisfy business majors running ""efficiency"" calculations (try telling patient one they've waiting hour past time scheduled procedure). 

A lot left quitting regular gigs work travelers double pay can. Yeah, antivaxx effed anyhow.  luckily health care workers tons time rest recuperate preparation next wave  does. It’s gut feeling one different. visiting Idaho? Gross! Run!

Source: stuck here. Yah yup yup yup Flew Germany couple weeks ago UK, required proof double vaccination travel.

Would suggest cases double vaccinated people. not. remember reading Delta new scene state (Arizona) health dept doesn’t even sequencing, Utah send small sample (maybe like 5% IIRC). Far greater risk heart (and organs) Covid vaccine. likely already every continent every major country. strong evidence original COVID-19 strain circulating US way back October/November 2019. Detection tends lag far behind presence something like this.  played game  always force state ""I'm happy"" whenever enter site. honest, lie little bit read articles. variant includes mutations like N501Y that’s proven helps immune escape. Read article, guy said “some protection”. Title clickbait. course going little bit protection it’s 5% efficacy it’s going change anything all.  Guess I’m Japanese now. Sweet. massive news coverage media loves anything scare factor clicks. like went nuts variations reason. evidence variation break vaccines used US spike protines magically change. Cause ethics completely us film industry moved Australia since able control virus 2020 july 2021 internal restrictions. hotel quarantine seemed able cope. comfort, lot twenties really suck regardless. 30 new fun. 20s involve going parties year hate, bad sex, everything expensive sitting home watching netflix. still three four. bet they'll get data today, simple throwing another (faulty) pcr test every positive sample detects specific proteïne strain variant lacks. know, people say time, yet I’ve YET see evidence mask mandate “significant” impact decrease COVID cases, including addition testing, vaccination, tracing, etc.

Show hard evidence that, I’ll change mind. administration capacity high enough. need vaccine self-administered. Chances is. people, 20s late 30s, coming moderate severe disease, needing intensive care. 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated,”

The country 24.1% fully vaccinated according even allowing vulnerable/most densely populated first, that's really reassuring anecdote accurate.  mum too, 2nd lesser degree 3rd shot. hurt bit, moreso place constant movement, e.g. neck. lasted almost 2 weeks 2nd shot, 3rd went away days. Im glad got shot. Im still waiting mine late Jan. even know Omnicron dangerous!!! media saying that! Putting fear people good, small business can't afford close again, family exponential growth. R-number 1,1 cases rising roughly 10-20% week death rate Texas must going roof! really hard fake test certificates, one actually checks see cert genuine sadly  true though
Our epidemic Denmark highly fueled children unvaccinated never said capitalism bad. would really good news actually. infections, protected death serious condition caused Covid. Let's hope work like that.  know fact people fly fake test results. know reliable number would be. vaccinated spread virus less thr unvaccinated. believe thr gap enough avoid virus become endemic. I'm smelling burn! Well plans supplies field hospitals ready go. know state does, since already set before. True, probably spread lot know, still important reduce spread early stages omicron gain time advantage. PCR tests crap. Denmark every single positive test screened variant is. found new Omicron variant yet find hard believe many people would board plane knowing sick.  
 
If there's one thing I've found true, rare exception people always best self interests - regardless impact others. 
 
COVID climate change completely cemented belief. also correct translation.

No isn't. joke funny based wrong translation. seem high me, know alarming. Oh.. accept rapid antigen tests. wonder. Cause saying people agree let die civil. people complain Covid never ending issue. Idiots. Complete idiots. They're Variants Interest. Last variant got upped Variant Concern status Delta variant.

Omicron mutated immediately got designated VoC. Zero doubt. it’s detected anywhere world, it’s already traveled NY that’s fact.  Yeah Germany lockdown end next week. People still know exponential growth works unfortunately here. Even 42,6%, chance 61 tests failing 0,000000000000002

Def something else play test fiability  That’s uh, strange comparison make, Ebola infectious.  ask proof said natural immunity hypothesis bs.

Those articles relevant. think several pronunciations English learned /ˈɑm.ɪ.ˌkɹɑn/, ɑ vowel “cot” ɪ middle vowel “carnivore”. Primary stress first syllable. Yes, this. sure believe. Africa. corrupt. 

People corrupt everywhere Africa Asia, rules different. 

If someone says racist something dumb like days, chances never African countries. 

They paid negative result. think it’s early know. get better data that’ll take time. Ah Jesus boer. Mother Nature getting sick (literally figuratively) humanity, COVID fever trying something it. true, left country, South Africa vaccination requirements foreign visitors? Right, scientists indicating evidence far shows Omicron could mild Delta; lot young people showing symptoms, sound mild me. bought another. Want another one? rapid test destination. Amsterdam got PCR tests otherwise options sequence results. people fly Africa New York Black Friday sales? media reports quoting passengers saying many passengers weren’t wearing mask (as done). Well SA one richer countries Africa sort meant mire poorer. yeah 35% vaccinated pretty useless sus. say cases spiked 15X week deaths 2x 11 days since Omnicron first detected? SA low vax rates boot. Totally sus.    thing, never super mutation kills everyone vaccinated, vaccines available US. Spike protines dont magically change , vaccines US keep people safe. get covid ? Yes , wont kill , get vaccinated get boosters. People wear masks rest thier lives live lockdown, 99% deaths unvaccinated people. markets also reacted delta, I'm saying situation may seem worse factors described. also completely pointless. Covid already everywhere. behavior hope stay even pandemic:

If cold/ sick - stay home.

If can’t (shopping, doctors visit…) wear mask.

Wash hands regularly - use opportunity sanitize Hands.

Don’t cough hands!

…

I don’t know shaking hands - kind miss it, unsanitary intensive care unit going see severe cases, quote doesn’t tell us many severe cases they’ve seen multiple thousands cases there. Yes, think know soon.  Absolutely not. Proper ICU care one stressful complicated medical procedure. life death, fundamental bodily processes brink falling apart kept alive machines. Operating machines keeping body functioning multidisciplinary medical problem, starting people moving around bed avoid pressure ulcers, way lab specialist hunting early signs within samples complete breakdown. think it’s early tell. need data take time. not.tested variant yet It’s like war. However weary won’t (or even government, world) want over. probably won’t really even over. 

It hasn’t even two years substantial chunk globe hasn’t vaccinated yet, specifically much Africa. It’s sadly predictable new strain came there. that’s PCR test something doesn’t add up. testing issue Belgian side guess. don’t know variant they’ve infected with. given prevalence province it’s likely it’s new one. 

A majority Covid cases always mild. Seems like two options, know yet.

Looking SA Hospitalizations next 2 weeks give us data. read new strain likely come someone already immunocompromised aids caught covid throw easily. predicted beginning. thing going keep going vaccinate everyone. None us safe us safe. 
I hoping USA would come senses nationalised medicine dealing disaster.  
Sitting bar 10 pm: totally SAFE, nothing bad happen.

Sitting bar 11:01: everyone talked last week DIE! vast majority mutations non viable.

It’s viable ones we’re concerned one appears viable virulent form may spread extreme ease. Early analysis suggests immune escape possible though full scope - could easily scaffold mutation turns strain something much worse.  Well, s/he say ""everybody"". organization's pandemic response plan still give damn masks social distancing. Rapid Antigen Tests far 100% best repeated. work, supposed self test twice week, even vaccinated coming in.

However, miss many bad. Everyone flight quarantined doubt, tests repeated. would interested see cases among flight. mean brainer. likely Europe point, Belgians first find like happened variants IIRC. Wow, they've already declared waiting till 3rd... cynical person might think delaying Black Friday sales could go through... one would ever put profit lives Americans would they?? A380 HUGE. found 61 Corona cases flights. variant clear yet. Welp, may swollen armpit/lymph node #3 booster I’m glad got done week we're lucky, addition mutations also spike proteins vaccine still recognises. we're lucky. Lmao, thought replied wrong person. Wearing mask difficult you? I'll go back original thought feel seatbelts then? Five days ago South Africa averaging 500 cases per day whole country. 10% two flights test positive. implies rapid growth extremely high transmissibility. That’s actual professionals saying.

So please stop talking. gives vibes Europe everyone stressed out. Research shows variant protein spike. 
mRNA vaccines like Pfizer Moderna likely still effective vs Omicron.
Tests ongoing. governments shut doors flights southern Africa? Surely governments would better informed us. flight long, 11hours plus. Airports terrible places spreading infection even plane frequent air changes fairly clean. far.

On flights you’re required wear mask whole time, I’m curious transmission based surgical mask vs n95 vs commercially available masks. story covid, instead school wanted kid stop messing around duplicator machine. remember chatting husband days ago wondering I'd able travel Europe next year in-person work retreat they're planning. live Japan they've (wisely) super strict people leaving one come they're tourists rn.

I said ""maybe next year it'll over??"" looked like crazy. like, gonna next year, even next years. Corona virus stay.

At time thought pessimistic I'm thinking maybe he's right :( Triage fine, makes sense resources limited. think mean 2 4 weeks (the public) know. think sounds like grandma smoking spliff. checked out? resemble remark. know talking about. flu literally prime example virus becoming endemic part non terminal. Seriously god damn.  OK then. shows vaccinated people... problem... bad outcomes. include sniffles. even know rapid antigen test identifies variant? antigen rapid tests identify? it’s spike, won’t work Omicron. it’s nucleocapsid, still work. still restrictions. Every city metro area, unique Vancouver. Fraud? No, know Delta. 99.99% samples Germany first two weeks November Delta. Omicron Delta cannot mistaken other, difference detectable regular PCR swab. chance it’ll bad though? way knowing that. Hang there, take time end. That's fair point feel we'll know much even 2-4 days. South African infection numbers start pointing confirmed Omicron *and* (at least) 61 passengers plane also confirmed infected Omicron, would indicate pretty rapid spread considering Omicron first detected sample Botswana 11 - two weeks ago! Thank you! 853 people capacity, packed like literal sardines I’m confused naming convention - get it, Greek alphabet.

So ones feel like I’ve heard of, since moving new naming convention alpha, delta, lambda omicron. imagine there’s missing letters, significant enough get press?  said new variant Nu. already infected, enough positive test. here. CES2020 Vegas. Met 2 companies frim Wuhan. Git sucj 6 days later. 7 days 20 peopke work sick. “Just” ???!!!  
I know people back March / April 2021, maybe best time haha. Exactly, I'm also fine additionally requiring test even PCR test (who cares pay additional 30-40 euros PCR test return ticket costs 500-600 euros). Hat on, sunglasses mask....I'm hiding am. ""Live it"" - There’s restaurant near parents named Omicron that’s probably none pleased right now. Shut drama production mention, tore nursing home Granville. 50 cases one time point something felt off. think already state. real panic large fraction 61 die. analogies point, son! French buddy Au Macron? skipped Xi old news. night, Bolsonaro banned foreigners SA last 15 days imposed 15 day quarantine Brazilians. American, really weird reading countries totally completely insane. Yea 77 cases...less 2 weeks since discovery...how know? BS SA's unique COVID dynamics prior make analysis challenging. Unlike many areas, Delta ""stranglehold"" region, I'd cautious trying determine R values Omicron.

Did Omicron establish fast due lack competition specific areas muscle Delta head-to-head race? I'm saying *not* quick spreader, I've seeing fairly sketchy numbers thrown around without strongest backing evidence, re-assuring say ""we know enough"", think that's best moment. know, looking India least country Indonesia, seems like herd immunity exist Covid. Indonesia got absolutely buttfucked Delta back July, yet daily cases plummeted level seen since April 2020, that's 34% ""fully"" (two shot) vaccinated. many untested cases excess deaths basically among us Indonesians either caught died, caught lived semi-immune, vaccinated.   follow twitter tho lol

What talking about? [She continued covering experience like twelve hours article Quick time saving response question Omicron came ask: ONE KNOWS YET. There. question answered. Aerospace-technology.com says, “ A380-800 Airbus tops list, massive seating capacity 853 passengers.” luckily airlines aren’t cruel, least people extra pocket money. “ Rightly dubbed Superjumbo, accommodates 525 passengers three-class configuration.” thing is, showing vaccinated people alone going tell us anything Delta also show vaccinated people. It'll require proper empirical evidence make judgements. think it’s safe say it’s everywhere point. less 100 known cases new variant worldwide old enough know whether infection result severe cases severe symptoms appear weeks current strains mistaken. 

Yeah, data. tap water regarding coronavirus? QUICK VACCINATE FETUS'S cow patties recall Omnicron variant spike doesn’t register current test, test spike antigens mutated variant. it’s picking capsid N protein, may change tests efficacy That’s surf contest Possible. also due low viral loads since superspreaders identified accurately. woosh already happened… People need king fauci final word Time stimulus checks inflation means viral load high enough even spotted. Probably even high enough infectious. rapid tested, stupidity.

Pcr stay home. test 100 sick people 42,6% sensitivity catch 43, 57 goes undetected. Unless it’s something urgent essential would postpone trip afford get money back credit. correct. nice article though. Short point. guess Omega Endgame, need stop collects protein spikes.  Sure, delta could same, even variants could. endemic trait sars-cov-2 ensue this, wont go away generations. matter time. Everyone come contact again, constant reinfection. europe globally. Vaccinated people protected well severe infection. Please two decades after, please. Here. We. Go. worries Straya!! Wait...werent pcr tested 72hrs flying? 10x growth 6 weeks exponential doesn’t mean it’s smart keep continually reintroducing it. I'm gonna need solid source this. Thought needed time find inaccuracy skews false negative, false positives far less common, correct? lol Biden xenophobe! bigot! Racist! Lrrr, ruler variant Omicron Persei 8!  go out. It’s almost certainly going kill especially vaccinated. Don’t waste 20s. even was, would 14 days managed isolation hotel, moved even isolated room positive variant. EU citizens allowed KLM flights.

lmao eat shit! mean sure prerogative allow whoever want country schadenfreude good miss on. possible 61 group? Like school group something traveled together, stayed together throughout trip tested positive return. I’m going pretend that’s true make feel bit better. Moronic. Yeah, seems like stupid article. know : 
“The companies said adapt mRNA vaccine within six weeks start shipping batches within 100 days escape variant identified.”

Won’t know much else lab tests come back results. shows vaccinated people. article say exact type brand test used boarding? Means tests South Africa worthless inaccurate. Guys worry still flu.

HARD SARCASM Thank information. German system seems easy fraud, QR code based hand written entries German vaccination book. entries created pharmacies. two steps opens loads fraud. European countries QR codes based entries central vaccination data bases. Yes, that, too! Freaked first didn’t reaction like initial J&amp;J shot. swollen lymph lasted 4-5 days returned normal pretty quickly. Worse swelling lymph actually painful time. explained huge issue. Oh, trust mucus, forgotten colds still exist. Brb, getting tea. went sale Black Friday definite illness benefit real apart maybe nu VOC enough data yet. let science ruin good outrage South African tested many positive omicron cases

So far cases hospitals proportion Delta

Meaning vaccine effective Decent analogy however Omicron mutation Alpha variant, Delta variant. it’s mutation mutation (ignoring fact Alpha small mutation)

Continuing analogy, don’t know mutations actually impact key shape, could impact key colour, key chain, etc. don’t know sure yet hoopla fact spike protein appear mutated significantly. Magically changed words. 

Whether that’s big deal open question. always knowing real data facts hard know, especially secrecy around it. Still say true problem network infrastructure.

I know much stuff, heard amazing Brazil vaccinating. really well set-up it, despite best public health service Totally dumb. we're already vaccinited, yet push masks again, live bullshit forever? Covid wont go away magically disappear. Outbreaks keep happening long dont bad af (or die) vaccine, ok. probably already over, suspected cases Belgium Germany. traveler Belgium even south Africa got Egypt/Turkey. That's quite like extreme K.... people dont even know order greek alphabet goes in. obvious reasons skip nu xi, cares. time China opens they'll less 100% vaccination rate anyone age 3, including booster shot.

At point time IFR 20 times lower immunonaive populations unvaccinated patients hospitals. suspect waste ton resources trying save idiots either. Isn’t also issue vaccines don’t work well people immunocompromised? don’t really way protect people stop cycle? level-headed comment makes feel better whole situation. Hugs Virginia! wear n95 take trip bro... point living life fear people literally buy n95s excellent respiratory protection. sure, imagine even anti-vaxx/vaxx-hesitant, that's South Africa. Throw huge numbers immuno-compromised folks things look pretty. doctor question also said patients young. reminded people 6% South Africans age 65 would take time see repercussions new variant older populations co-morbidities. Hopefully also mild illness everyone, currently evidence one way other. Yeah but...this possible cause real alarm? scientists concerned, concerned. tracking variants whole time. They're loud one. Let media job. might need know. fast. I’ve read, evolutionary pressure virus become “milder” since spreads pre-symptomatically asymptotically. Honestly, cities people living everyone smiling day? read myocarditis COVID-19 patients incidence 146 per 100,000. according vaccinated people incidence 2.3 per 100,000.

Is correct? focused important points here, see. Subjective quibbles CNN headline. Oy. first US case Omicron found Florida test it...

\*thinking guy meme\* Polio small pox carried animal hosts.

Covid is. 

As long covid non vaccinated animal hosts it'll forever mutate stopped outbreaks South America. 🤞🏻🤞🏻 finding that? Source? It’s nearly two years widely avaialable vaccines. People done right thing destroyed life past 1.5 years tired miserable. 

A covid restricted life, one vaccinated, isn’t one worth living, frankly. get it, serve science experiment rest us test immune response vaccines new variant /s Wait. There’s B.1.640 variant? isn’t even surprising anymore, covid stay like flu different strains every season. Enough gas lighting fear mongering media outlets governments. plenty vaccines, masks, even treatment available reduce covid death hospitalizations. It’s time get back normal keep hiding every little variant. we're finding originate South Africa probably floating around multiple countries past month possibly months. Absolutely smart thing do. ""Go hard go early"" cited repeatedly one major lessons pandemic thus far. 

I expect rest us (and particularly U.S.) sit around tell enough data anything meaningful yet millions preventable Omicron infections occur world. We'd really better hope bad potential be... ""Lol remember shit. Along Fauci saying ""You dobt need masks.. FLU BASED VIRUS DOESNT TRANSMIT AEROSOL"". 

FUCK. Didn’t say thing Delta Variant? think we’ve hit ceiling vaccinations state. don’t think people falling dead streets would change thing. Delta ravaged us still don’t 50% vaccinated. would advice us immunocompromised people be? say “fuck it!” move on? Cause follow advice til cases way down. accept hat industries change times. Nothing lasts forever. # 1 baby name trending - Omicron Question, people like actively spreading virus whole time? need time see… know it’s hypothetical, that’s point. I’m saying it’s pointless, also perhaps even counterproductive ways sit around dreaming nightmare scenarios without evidential basis. purpose making 1 3 CFR idea thin air serve? IIRC increase vaccination rate Delta first hit, people realized couldn’t wait virus die down. Something similar might happen people, doubt effect widespread. think people still aren’t vaccinated point made minds and/or care little isn’t going spur action previous events did. spreading least months.

This variant likely around since mid October:  Well that's strictly true, Israel closed borders far. Yes. headline poorly written.

Honestly. think compliant here? Unvaxxed: hehe good luck everybody else! got vaccinated soon became available chance obeying lockdowns restrictions. even carpet bombed countries need boxes vaccines, many facilities store them, let alone administer widely. remember back day reading research paper Africa, found getting higher DNA yields plants whole extraction higher RT vs RT ice, way west. adjust climate control experiment, wrote paper *didn't have* adequate climate control labs. took problem got paper least. remember “leaves three, let be” lesson learned summer camp desperate moment wicked wicked woods  UAE Pfizer Moderna, inactivated vaccines. haven’t seen many people 2 years. 3 vaccines, immunocompromised, cases go way, way life hold. traveling, restaurants, packed gyms, theaters. Welcome us *have* live.  Looking *far* fewer sequences GISAID Africa (5,998) last 3 months North America Europe South Africa posted almost half African sequences almost 2800. Botswana posted 680. Angola posted 110. Malawi posted 27. Mozambique posted *zero*. disparity.  going to, obviously, open eventually. need share treatment vaccine technology. First photo world Omicron variant, created research area Multimodal Medicine Child Jesus (coordinated Prof. Carlo Federico Perno), direct supervision Prof. Claudia Alteri (in collaboration State University Milan), Valentino Costabile, Rossana Scutari, Luna Colagrossi.

The photo shows structure spike protein Omicron variant, right, Delta variant, left, compared original SARS CoV-2 spike.

Omicron many Delta mutations (already varied), concentrated area interacts human cells. red dots indicate areas high variability, orange ones high variability, yellow ones medium variability, green ones low variability, celestial ones low variability. gray area one vary. automatically mean variations dangerous, simply virus adapted human species generating another variant. ""Further studies tell us adaptation neutral, less dangerous, dangerous"", comment researchers. it’s mandated certain states, Illinois still mandated (not surprisingly) people trying yo fight months saying people keeping mask mandate installed idiotic they’re “for flu” mask mandate “forever” lol mental gymnastics honestly impressive Makes think sequencing lacking several months assuming every case Delta. know many countries confirmed last 24 hrs. Everybody looking now.... end game then? Living like movie Interstellar lived farms middle nowhere away people?  going great day earth piece tihs seid, kcuf fauci! interest, given 13% 19% incidence HIV possible widespread use anti-retroviral drugs could affect hospitalisation mortality rates within South Africa? That’s theses viruses go isn’t it? Evolutionary speaking. transmittable less deadly versions spread furthest. I’ve heard since beginning. live Michigan, get booster six months up? I’m five want limit cases entering. stop foreigners entering force arrivals quarantine (even vaccinated), contact trace figure omicron cases came buy time researchers confirm whether variant threat vaccine effectiveness. Yes, even recognize lucky luxury dumb. Perhaps vaccinating everyone soon possible would world’s best interest.

Except plan go convincing that? Unhappy dead though Vaccines, Fuck yeah 
Masks, whatever 
But distancing? HEEEELLL no. Nobody going tolerate restrictions can't do. People want go ""virtual"" Comic Cons zoom holidays anymore, want see people. vaccines priority EVERY mitigation effort. didn’t care Alpha Delta would care Omicron, especially vaccines may protect it. think option closing airport.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yet?  nothingburger. one knows enough yet. Urgent worldwide health issue…. Waits 72 hours implement ban LURR RULER PLANET OMICRON PERSI 8 it'll probably raging full force time Christmas travel. Yes, lucky luxury dumb.    So.. travel ban supposed help point? That’s it’s ridiculousness people social media saying SA ‘punished” open? What’s alternative- collective punishment millions cases. moral scenario? Echoes China politicised ‘racist’ ban entry region According article, data used study China 54% vaccination rate. August, countries presented higher vaccination rates China, 54 per cent eligible population inoculated. 

The numbers probably would different used current Chinese vaccination rate. wouldn’t surprised kept saying there’s new variant efficacy vaccines great. US lockdown again. Omicron infectious supposed less deadly. Fingers crossed, burn quickly. Locking extremely unpopular anyway benefits nobody politically. vaccin make sick, virus much worse.

The vaccin disappears days, whereas virus replicates. get spike proteins, much much higher dosis. wonder virus 'side effects', worse.

Obviously virus spike protein.

But arguments never convince anti vaxxer. bummer. starting get back tourists coming back in. work tourist industry Israel. agree move it’s going easy industry. Means working. Seems like know much India then, since they're apparently fine far looks like Omicron biggest nothingburger yet. respect cautious man fucking overblown. OP, argument important, large part antivax rethoric compare getting shot nothing terms risks, discarding actual chance getting illness associated risks. 1 chance 50000 get myocarditis seems like huge risk believe alternative nothing. course, compared risk getting covid x death rate unvaccinated individuals getting covid, much much higher. Thanks heads up! one talking this. Wow! Certainly one size fits kind medicine. like dire circumstances. That's unfortunate find out. Good take, think too. oh sorry, didnt realize adjust typing style order taken seriously someone dismissing comment mere letter capitalization. heres sources. [x] (an english article) (in dutch, concrete numbers) yes would mean nothing changed already know. *for two weeks, i.e. learnt deadliness Actions speak louder words always. tell everything fine smarter countries around world lockdown slightly value getting completely destroyed new variant ends dangerous. Considering low rates SA mutations statistically tend occur high-infection areas, leads believe really know variant originated, South Africa first place detected.  would think so, US, least, Im sure. Unless horrific death rate I'm pretty sure right country would find something else blame ignore like they've done last 18 months Rumor China planted Africa able determine that? anything, small part medias reaction this, it’ll likely opposite effect. thanks :)! right ""I'm still supported parents"" I'd take now. Delta still current immediate threat.  Please, please let thing! like watching city-sized icebergs calve glacier.

While boat right underneath. statements true... Source?  Ive bit lazy getting booster news new thing spurred making appointment. Unfortunately seems quite people decided thing rough finding appointment next week! least littles getting second shot Monday. Biden agreed support waiver, mean U.S. pharmaceutical companies must start giving away vaccine recipes developing countries make own.

The WTO consensus-based organization cannot move forward unless European Union, waiver, everyone else agrees. WTO members agree, next steps would countries implement national level removing legal risks hinder production supply alternative producers. clarify implementation options, countries must start text-based negotiations WTO, going item complex multilayered IP legal requirements — process could take months, even years.

""I'm going put odds likely find agreement,"" said WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell, summarizing WTO closed-door General Council meeting TRIPS waiver Wednesday.

But said consensus need wider access COVID-19 vaccines treatments. Oh, please. research. Watch YT video engineer.

Modern jets use hot air come first compressor one engines. bleed 20% per turnover, adding much air back in. Better turnover closed home.

And use HEPA filters. simply true. small minority people buying much could carry. That's cleared shelves, average person buying little extra. extra.  Adapt vaccine Delta Yes. highest rates incarceration dissatisfaction world. Omicron sounds like fully evolved Digimon villian. Short that’s, least select non-ominous ones. latest sounds like killer robot. Mask adherence Netherlands overall high Omicron first detection November 11th. opportunity ""exported"" two weeks already. Let's hope taking action late Depends local authorities. Correct, called burn out. 

Unfortunately volatility mutations (Eight) means may evade current vaccines part. 

Also, global low vaccination means people positive, overwhelming already overwhelmed system. 

Higher transmisson rate = higher hospitalization rate = higher death rate. 

This next worse case scenario. thing worse would higher instances stronger immune reaction would Unfortunately kill thousands chidren older adults, regardless VAX status. go... South Africa currently stopping imports vaccines much supply enough people coming take shots. sure situation Botswana Serious question..whats point fear type headline. Yes real yes need take precautions  Maybe instead handing stimulus checks rich people millionaires, focus increased job loss benefits impacted lockdowns most, like service workers. Like Canada did, working home? stimulus you. America dumb quite inaccurate. vote ending restrictions. voting new law gives government power areas confirms legality certificate. Things like always need backed public, that's democracy Switzerland works. 

It's like ""vote ending restrictions"". Well definitely wrong. thought recombination actually pretty rare coronaviruses. Fewer fewer everyday, seems. Get booster, make sure parents older family members boosters, go live life.

Wear masks required literally need wear one outside ever. Go out, travel, see friends, things love. You’ve shots unless serious health issues, you’re good you’ll fine. Michigan currently worst country last checked. also zero COVID restrictions even liberal areas people bothering masks. first mass use it, around 15 years, iirc.

But people truly object mRNA, always JnJ. Viruses constantly evolving. longer infection, mutations greater risk immune system recognise virus. Happy wear mask now, post-pandemic, dangerous experiment. efficacy B cells already shown Hong Kong cases too

Right can't draw conclusions like this. wishful thinking anecdotes.

But I'll try take advice stop posting worthless comments wait some, any, data, anecdotes. Yeah, really understand kind bidet, sounds messy disgusting use. Yes it’s forever. That’s well established doesn’t mean can’t take measures stop spread new variants higher worldwide vaccination rate. can't wait COVID season Cells Work! countries actually reacting normally this. It’s South Africa part.

South Africa good job research alerting world. applauded that. China knew deadly novel virus spreading Wuhan. countries sending aid forms help contain breakouts.

But know much mutant virus spread there, rest world entirely justified preventing travel SA. 

This Omicron virus could next Delta must contained much possible. vaccines treatments use tailored spike protein. It’s definitely good idea cautious play safe.  I'm thinking Canada beat US, specifically British Columbia, like 2 weeks since last apocalyptic event happened there, honestly, can't that. lots wrong answers, keeping passengers plane vents always wrongest answer. idea it’s still first answer airlines try use situation. what? Totes IR ES requested PCR months back. goes route backwards.

ES AT, DE DE ES people know.

I’m outside EU airline told PCR go back.

What find surprising whole flight could take antigen test coming exactly side globe.

The whole point getting tested positives inside aircraft, it’s pointless it’s it’s supposed 😕 I'm due (and eligible) booster. take wait Pfizer/Moderna new variant crafted booster? Imagine getting triggered wearing piece cloth. 

This everything kept open, want, slow rate others getting sick. 

Surely even ardent ""back normal"" person understands this. Yeah cost 2+ 9/11s week freedom?😷🥳 Sure, case assume fine proven otherwise. That's completely reckless. know enough worried. would imagine becoming disabled possibly dying disease high transmission rate would also effect peoples lives well. Again, body people could implement various financial safeguards people voted pay taxes exact kind protections. Oh wait, already that…. HVAC standards. Netherlands ain't exactly Congo. travelled train early one morning days ago first time since January 2020. person 6 got station wearing mask amongst 20 - 25 people got train changed single mask seen.

Despite cases remaining quite steady although masks clearly thing controlling spread agree necessary shops public transport find exactly threat, new variant poses. US least good number people Thanksgiving interrupted.  we? Yes. Ethically problematic though.

We need data soon well current vaccines perform preventing serious disease Omicron. see months ahead look like ? said PCR tests far. Lol ""should"". gotten now, there's way news new variant half way across world motivate them.

Hope one deadly Delta. Lot people included cannot get booster yet. used sign someone underestimating first time say media absolutely unhelpful. Doctors Youtube souting number mutations honestly wonder much public health riding algorithm. Also realize committed greek alphabet picking shorter names would also help avoid panic. Depends going. don’t think airlines mandate anything. travelled Dominican Republic weeks ago test needed all. Closing economy impact peoples lives too. world black white make be.  Thanks.

Possibly even coming week. maybe Monday-Tuesday take job. someone speaks uncertainty doesn’t mean everyone confused scared are. Rachel Ní Faoláin said vaccinated greater risk society double triple jabbed Covid said Covid certificates encouragement discrimination “a new large cheers crowd complained treatment vaccine passports said “coercion” never acceptable functioning democratic past twenty months, society evolved dictatorship, totalitarian dystopia,” said, speaking platform beside become intolerant... hate speech towards unvaccinated people become norm rising exponentially.”

See people take vaccine new variant.

This speaker seems relish “victim” status well spreading misinformation. US Citizens Legal Residents still go Southern Africa return Southern Africa anytime, Southern Africans cant come here, correct? Lol. 

In words don’t control data set. 

I’m convinced neutralizing antibodies fade boosters helpful controlling spread populations vaccinated early. 

But anecdata stories vastly outweighed population level sets showing vaccines reducing spread. Source slow build up? Maybe would also good news treating antiviral pills need taken early. regularly samples analyzed US find strain is? I'd bet money already US, wonder detection? like even test lot general. dumb. adapt works delta omicron new one cause example omicron came beta.

Compare influenza, require new annual flu vaccine every year, actually cocktail 3 variants thinks 3 new predominant stains year viruses mutated enough evade immune resistance previous year. even then, influenza strains often time mutate enough start manufacturing flu shots receive reduce effectiveness degree.

Yes, could theory become annual thing like influenza. would require COVID-19 behave way far coronaviruses demonstrated. example, one causes common cold coronavirus, naturally acquired immunity generally good least 3-4 years IIRC. agree. entire government doesnt give shit us bought out. sad sucks. person truly say people Bernie Sanders doesnt enough power make difference. sad Lol. think so. i’m shocked masks longer required public transport shops UK Literally nobody advocating that, get grip  Thanks China know safe. rather less safe two weeks ago. 

You're vaccines almost certainly still work. Relax. Lol, sorry guys! Shit maybe tested positive got really sick even though booster. way we're ever going hit 90% vaccination US unvaccinated start dying enough drop % 30ish 10. unfortunately happen quick enough

That's direct quote. OP hoping mass death. Exactly. restrictions losing jobs problem, getting sick. Drop lockdown, everyone brain gets vaccinated protected, people want get vaccinated get sick. Fuck em. There's small portion population can't lock take precautions. get sick treatments them. Inb4 banned making reasonable comment South Africa pretty advanced dealing infectious disease. SA may first identify necessarily place origination. 

That said, seems we’re always day late dealing coronavirus albeit may bit ahead case. 

I wouldn’t surprised it’s already US. HO. 

Vaccines need supplied poorer energizing nations. would help trying keep mutations low. 

We need think ways help keep transmission manageable. would like see US govt subsidize provide N95s must worn public spaces schools. blue paper masks fabric nit enough. 

Omicron concern upsetting. Time tell. Well vaccines well hoped, whatever reason. They're good added protection one must travel. leisure travel? Maybe society need rethink this. Maybe entitled consume way around world fun all.

I say someone traveled lot. I'm glad did, end helped add climate crisis well. may larger point even: driving much destructive, aimless flying doing?

The world needs change maybe covid telling us need visit Disneyland annually want to.

Travel needed made special is. bourgeois caste mark travel edification maybe needs dropped list must haves.

I also say someone researches writes 19C travel tourism. drunk? We're referring guy said OCN. that? like calling Delta DLA sounds like absolute hell I’d surprised wasn’t already comment thread. That's exactly reason though. northern areas people stay inside winter southern climates summer. evades antibodies variants, &amp; B cell immunity still applies. unvaccinated friends anymore - reason friends dangerous degenerates.

As data - like something could convince you, real choice get effective vaccine. don't. family too, traveling New York 2 years That's works real world though. mix surgical N95 masks. Plus airlines Europe least resumed in-flight service means people constantly taking masks eat drink, cart rolled aisle people. Stop asking questions make sense. must panic! According CDC, test ~750 samples state per week. jurisdictions test representative subset.  first red flag number mutations. previous ""worst"" VOC record holder number total mutations usually number spike mutations; Alpha 16 total mutations, Gamma 19, Delta 23. Omicron 31 spike mutations. record holders fizzled out, number certainly makes interest scientists. Additionally, 11 spike mutations either never seen seen fewer 100 times humans - that's ""new"" spike mutations previous VOC besides Gamma total spike mutations.

The second red flag rate spread. Omicron cases rising something like 5x (or maybe 3x, 6x) per week Johannesburg, Delta cases remain constant. two weeks went first sample collection causing large surge city. one orders magnitude previous jump we've seen, means first time since summer 2020 VOC spreading faster study it. rate spread holds up, weeks causes case surges areas direct travel Johannesburg.

Nobody's long enough measure severity immune escape, things normally know months advance new VOC causes surge. rightfully causing alarm, cases useless panic, rush figure out. Right essentially anecdotes handful people infected week, promising. However, South Africa's daily deaths also taken significant jump. Every day going bring new information there.

Viruses tendency become transmissible, less deadly time, virus typically actually want kill host otherwise can't mutate spread easily. 

Unfortunately, guarantee, need careful. However, good news that, since taken long notice new variant, likely already spread, likely deadly, least struggling beat Delta. We'll see testing reveals. oh god, again! people learn last time virus affects respiratory system, ass? That's statisticians do. 600 people decent sample size, though definitely many factors could bias skew it, said ""looks like"" ""could"". Also, you’re right.

Yeah, ignoring new variant entirely, nuts 1 10 people plane covid. Either people covid much likely fly planes, disease prevalence extremely high right South Africa. I’m afraid go walk unfortunately, maybe find courage talking variant, idea much variant impacts immunity, transmission, mortality. Ergo lockdown silly.

At one point initial surge split teams two that, folks needed on-site work, half could certain job ever given time. saved us couple stoppages team would get quarantined, would go back there's inkling omicron break vaccines. amount UK people Disney World right astounding zero evolutionary pressure forcing covid become less deadly.

That happens virus cannot spread kills spreading hampered symptoms. Covid takes weeks kill, spreads asymptomatic. Covid takes week become concerning mild cold many cases.

Problem stating covid vaccination gives better immunity little studies done, amount data super limited. Normally never draw kind conclusions based current data since crisis try anyways.
CDC also states super problematic compare studies studies point wildly different conclusions regards much immunity types protection provide.

It true little data found point towards vaccination gives immunity, contradicts cdc's conclusion severe symptoms lead production antibodies. (Link 1)

Also question regarding better immunity contradicted article August stating B, cells created equal one natural infection last longer broad, matches know virus infections general. limited data hard draw conclusions based studies. however know old school vaccines provide worse protection virus Everytime mRNA vaccines might different though mechanism (link 2)

Lifestyle changes changed worse covid. makes perfect sense staying home need socialize means less reason work improve health.(link 3); research gut microbiome know important lifestyle immune system, far important aspect ø. Weak immune system allows virus mutate basically immune system weak enough virus relatively easy time mutating (link 4). currently saving people super weak immune systems indirectly decreasing strength healthy peoples immune systems. also lots social isolation covid causes havoc immune system aswell.

My rant whatever fed up, rant potential virus mutate super virus.
So far covid gotten deadly infectious. longer keep higher probability we'll get super virus perfect combination high infection rate super lethal.
Think ebola combined covid, reason ebola died transmitting rate low.
A high lethality rate problem covid spreads easily.

The mutation rate RNA virus way high, expecting vaccine n isolation kill simply possible (link 5). takes one case world start whole COVID show over,.

Most guys focused short term saving thousands, history anything go might look virus kills millions maybe even billions worst case scenario. might extreme seen 100 years back Spanish flu. took one mutating Spanish flu dangerous COVID currently is, becoming disease killed young healthy men n women matter 1 day. (Link 6)

I really care people exactly super mad current situation. current infection rate see accelerating speed mutation, virus already one two important traits becoming super virus, ability transmitt easily.


Based concluded pandemic weakens immune system, believed weak immune system gives virus opportunity mutate mutations likely super virus emerge. Herd immunity thing throughout history got us pandemic current proportions. 
I would love vaccines n genetic entropy could job fear going route would mean higher risk we'll super virus due diminishing effect immunity 7-day running average cases country risen 40% day last two days. However, ""confirmed"" cases require sequencing recent. one wears em inside think ppl do, don’t bother replying.

Yes, little isolated world represents humanity anyone's experience different, reply. might also idiot category.  think people legitimately concerned, last two years sucked. one wants go another year shelter place schooling home, people concerns well health ones. think appetite restrictions low America unless strain significantly dangerous. hear news Merck? Tough news day does, read it.  Yes would! Think scary looking ebola high death rate. another user mentioned people take shit instantly serious confro
ntingly terrifying. almost like planning threats last 2 years.  fuck could possibly even know first thing me?? #1 Christmas wish list. second thing clearly reading obituary. variant problem Ebola lucky deadly HORRIFYING movie like way corona unfortunately. 

I've always pessimistic situation corona viruses (liek common cold viruses believe many) mutate frequently never able successfully vaccinate them. expert however please correct know better. agree exponential percentses. *let 'er rip*, we'll know soon enough. like epidemiologists call tiger. currently-approved vaccines good job stopping original Alpha variants. Unfortunately Delta lurking there, Delta could partially evade vaccine transmissible, vaccines didn’t stop Delta well original Alpha.

And Omicron might evade vaccines even Delta might also highly transmissible. It’s two years. Move on. I’d rather 1% chance death waste life away. isn’t going away. It’s likely didn’t even start South Africa. really advanced screening, first find it. Don’t racist, bro  log people “Hopefully millions people die” wow great person sunnier way say everyone saying. Vaccines less effective. zero effective. One scientists article says could ""very bad"" know yet. 

It's article others reassuring title.  It’s question scared, it’s practicing common sense global pandemic. Sorry, used better tone. think confused another person replied to.

The scientific approach right would collect data, right now. Then, data shows variant serious threat, respond know works. mainly consists vaccines treatments.

As cares travel bans, lot public health problems world Covid. south portion African continent poor place people die malnutrition curable diseases time. Travel bans make worse. can't write ""economic,"" things kill people.

It could directly counterproductive, too. believed new variants almost always develop someone compromised immune system, usually uncontrolled HIV infection. Travel bans severely limit HIV eradication programs which, unlike Covid eradication programs, actually worked parts world. untreated HIV means Covid variants.

So, improbable upside + several potential downsides likely basis recommendation. Sorry hope better answer. never ending….
Fuckin hell man  society continue make fun people cut fingers cooking too?

If they're holding knife wrong end certainly. Recently three fully vaccinated Pittsburgh Steelers players got Covid…I thinking new variant happened…good news mild cases recovered within week booster! Get booster, chaaaannnnce! I'm saying ""long term"" thinking terms benefits results shutting travel trying ""contain"" variant. long term feasible, still going spread fruitless. want pat selves back weeks ""slowing spread"" immediately open back would absolutely fruitless like initial lockdowns were. 2 years coping strategies involve fruitless, pointless short term shutdowns. overly reactive misguided evidenced recent past failures.  blackest Fridays.  wanted Pie...  it’s transformer need teenage boy girlfriend guide them. There's name people like that. ""non-parents"". People allowing smack mental health even proper data. media running capitalizing news everyone browning pants it. 

I wish everyone would relax bit. Things going back lockdown lifes feeling mostly semi-normal double vaxxed breakthrough case (even happens) new variant severe also provide stellar update immune cells. 

If variants spike proteins mutated much, personally believe unlikely put dent Delta. we'll see country barely 25% vaxxed. Fun fact: log live life normal, variant doesn’t even exist you’ll much happier little bit data find, seems like people tested positive home countries either asymptomatic positives mild illness. thing found long lag time clinical illness positivity. 2 Hong Kong cases tested positive 9 days we're negative point. Others became symptomatic 11 days. indicates potentially lower replication speed, unlike delta, 280x virus particles alpha. Delta onset symptoms 3-4 days comparison. lot breakthrough cases delta likely even true breakthroughs, transient replication replicates damn fast immune system starts thing. 
This, hand, may replicating slower, may give immune system time respond maintaining mild infection go apeshit super high viral burden. 

Or... could mean absolutely nothing. 🤦 want see plays out? Like... I'm curious crazy timeline gets. seem conflating wanting masks sake wanting masks wanting masks appropriate response situation that's evolving.  So, one hand, bit disappointing. hand, shows scientists jobs! r/BoneAppleTea It’s Black Friday. It’s always sell fest. Watch jump back 500 points Monday.

South Africa cases delta variant got detected recently started getting screened en masse yesterday day before. really, really hard try compare 2 circumstances think certain media outlets Twitter personalities drawing dumb conclusions.

Any guesses transmissible compared delta right honestly might well using dice draw numbers went international builder show Vegas Jan 2020, 100k + ppl huge Asian/china attendance. Vegas convention center masks obviously etc etc.. 5 team took flight back got nasty “cold” afterwards. Looking back it’s hard think Covid. best, live GA, try bring low key, basically say, “better hooked ECMO machine” people like wtf ECMO machine? explain half google like wtf?!? half like “meh”. 

it’s really really frustrating though US. i’m dead afraid medical debt usually say, “oh 30s even covid-19 like 100k medical debt” there’s many cases eventually something hit change Thats likely governments finally learned tough lesson. borders closed high infectious countries earlier, could much better spot. Instead Canada's government considered racist close borders China March 2020. I'm glad idiots learned lesson.  Wow fast.  That's funny think it. Like wouldn’t good thing variant contagious deadly delta? people won’t need hospitalization vaccines and, it’s really contagious, option essentially “let rip” among unvaccinated. words, we’ll get herd immunity faster unvaccinated recovered dead months instead years. Exactly, media selling fear narrative sells. follow scientists saying. assholes spend 5 hours eating single pack peanuts siggit thelibs  We're lucky variant comes testing. know omicron pcr test different signal (2 channels light instead 3) really appreciated reading this, needed it, thank you. 600 people airplane? like calling fire department told trucks way, ETA: 72 hours. understand testing centres send random samples CDC. Perhaps ask samples sent time being. opposite also true. don’t know yet.  South Africa best scientists, first identify new variant, again. “sHUt trAVEL SOuth afRIca lol”

Absolutely classic Well look Joe Biden racist banning travel US.  


What racist.  1st recorded case
It probably awhile  It’s awhile since daily discussion thread went 1k.  San Diego people done masks since summer. :\ I’m boosted up, never stopped wearing mine. could see Delta UK everyone throwing away masks, we’ve got Omicron way. thanks. transmissible there’s definitely something dont know do. 

Is like government CIA must known Hussein WMDs going Iraq? I've heard one before, turned know better fabricating evidence assuming they'd find real stuff later. people charge faking make it.  India may actually better places estimates level natural immunity charts. Well would call Ξ ξ greek letter Ο ο (Omicron)  think people claim media fear mongering reading fears news reports. mean, that's task media - inform people. vaccines free accessible guys townships? Markets routinely panic downside go all-in-on exorbitant greed bubbles “In short-term, market popularity contest. long-term, market weighing machine.” -- Warren Buffett

Particularly secular bull market market gets emotional sells strongly consider reaction oversold ""Buy there's blood streets, even blood own."" ""Bull markets climb wall worry"" (also unknown) 5x number come from? seen kicking around source Ah interesting! Noob question: assuming it’s spreading well 28 days already undetected, assuming it’s deadly, would already expect seeing spike ICU capacities?  click-chasing sensationalism media engages in, still going largely lean truth.

Compare end result places like Facebook sheer festering misinformation coming boggles mind name media second virus itself. Buying used BMW NEED security. repairs bills way.

Source: German car owner basically spends $1800 anytime something goes wrong stupid car. Omicron percy I8 ""This virus supposed 5x infectious delta."" think known. read said that? Gotta get extra money want travel weekend!! Honestly last time flew , people plane start give flying fuck maskmandate hour flight. looking excuses take mask off.

And time takes Africa Netherlands way one hour. 1) VOC looks problematic VOCs due structure apparent rapidity rise predominance witwhere observed 
2) know fact effective vaccines it. requires least little time data collection studies. sequenced this. research garbage data easily accessible UK. Seems leading pack. Passengers: 575 typical, 853 max

However, think that's relevant this, yes plausible amount passengers flight lived WA absolutely know LOL great state Georgia, lol sequence it’s genome **News article since edited!** New translation:

61 600 passengers South Africa tested positive, variant still unclear

Of 600 passengers two KLM flights South Africa, 61 tested positive coronavirus. two flights landed Schiphol yesterday morning. passengers tested, new variant coronavirus circulating southern Africa.

It yet clear whether 61 infections omikron variant. travelers arrived southern Africa since Monday asked GGD get tested soon possible.

All passengers age 13 flew South Africa Netherlands show negative rapid test 24 hours old boarding. EU citizens allowed KLM flights.

Last night, GGD said still taking account 85 positive coronate tests. estimate made 110 600 test results known. those, 15 positive.
Omikron variant

Since 12:00 yesterday afternoon, no-fly zone effect South Africa countries southern Africa new corona variant discovered there. so-called omikron variant, currently circulating mainly South Africa Botswana. According working group, variant coronavirus appears spreading faster variants.

At time outgoing cabinet announced flight ban, still two flights South Africa en route Netherlands. passengers tested Schiphol Friday afternoon. Special test lanes set airport purpose.
Isolation hotel

Travelers negative result may leave airport. spend another five days quarantine home.

Passengers tested positive transferred guarded isolation hotel near Schiphol Airport. must stay seven days complaints five days complaints.

There exception positively tested travelers roommates home flight: able go home transportation, allowed stay isolation home. means people living alone people road roommates allowed go home.
Understanding frustration

In statement, GGD Kennemerland says understands ""that frustration among passengers situation"". travelers South Africa wait hours Schiphol Airport coronatest results.

""People long journey land assumption home near future. Instead, confronted situation like never experienced Netherlands,"" writes GGD.

The health service emphasizes operation rigged ""in interest public health"" protect passengers surroundings.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) makes tiring constant bickering finger pointing sides. Yes, virus affects lives sucks, people would stop fighting would make world difference; even agree, stop fighting. What’s next? Optimus Prime variant? Well go. Welcome 2020 2.


But hey! going 2020 round 2 vaccines give us edge didn’t before. world much different place two years ago, better prepared now. I'm proud you.

Yes. easy. People hard-on living edge death USA something. can't bring work. can't bring extended family dinners. tell ones love love themselves? others?

It's... sad. Yep. Amy Cuddy calls ""Pandemic Flux Syndrome"". Brene Brown's podcast talking disregulating is. nervous systems meant level uncertainty challenge. mass collective trauma. Take care friend gentle others. Aids huge problem. need vaccine.  Anti-vaxxers mouth full feathers now. Surprised talk COVID don’t, point moot. Yet That's really helpful way look things, time around know hopefully better knowledge. work way. One superspreading event lead 100 new infections single incident single day (like Washington choir practice event 1 person infected 52 60 attendees). low numbers, single event like significant elevating numbers start many new transmission chains making likely future superspreading events variant.

I infinite amount time continue though, later. know. We've known 3 days. able say certainty Delta even 3 months. sure reality live ... enough countries states struggling high surge that's putting strain hospitals. Correction: Everyone tested rapid test less 24 hours departure. Seriously giving Diamond Princess vibes. need press conference alert us do. idiots aren’t better i’m idaho actually came US Japan won’t accept Sinovac vaccines. want travel foreign student thought better prepared even stricter rules. got jab Pfizer one arm flu soon got plane. fucking glorious, typed data CVS even gave vaccine giving out. JC, Chilean government strict one get Pfizer hardest, holy shit didn’t think easy. 

idk felt bad time, felt like shit 3 days. def worth now. dec 12 final dose pfizer! Chile get pfizer boosters yay also worth noting infected people Johannesburg young, young people likely traveling less likely experience serious symptoms. patient one. Old news; it’s 61 600 (you read [here, it’s makes easier six-month supply. varies lot regionally. E.g. Vegas Huntington Beach nobody wore masks. smaller “blue” towns Even get COVID boosters, really end world? Imo, no.  Thankss Interesting. made hate social media.

And taught seek credible reliable media. spreads faster able evade immune function since substantially different Wild Covid, Delta able ravage populations, Omicron. contageous means people become infected following even death rate Wild Covid mean real numbers deaths greater. virulent wild covid Delta death numbers greater %.

The second part infectious hospital system could collapse weight cases. hear people dying things heart attack vehicle accidents.

My son keratoconus. monitored. covid get see dr since specialist actually see face face assess eyes. got see Dr eyes deteriorated substantially time. sure people slipped cracks health condition. get booster next week like I’m scheduled wait now? They'd fill pool diarrhea complain someone pissed  agree plan get booster, wondering particular situation. It’s late contain it. It’s Europe now. Meaning US would already shut flights Europe. time it’s found states. every single bit bad news twice bad initially reported

and every single bit good news half good Wanna place bets reaches Florida? Sorry, allowed. pray rain, deal mud /s grasp it. needs doing. want wrong! first time felt deep alarm since vaccinated. Crossing fingers hoping wrong.

Or, variant takes over, hope mutated enough less virulent, even may contagious. Central Valley know better last winter. family divided this, even severe illness death. tough comprehend. I'm sorry. hear family trying! Hey vook, here's another really interesting informative thread:  always said, ban vaccines weeks antivaxxers get ""the government tell do"". Ahh shit go scale 1-10 bad Omicorn get? worse Delta?, media yellow journalism fear based overreaction? vaccines still protect us death severe illness hospitalizations VOC doomsday news Omicorn. Hey Canadianista, here's another really interesting informative thread:  Good sign. Though it’s worth noting also less fully vaccinated people SA, around 24%. Apparently - least enough come Covid-related subreddit complain story instead ignoring it. Stupid question, one strain take another?

I would assume someone cannot simultaneously infected two strains covid? So, Omicron system... door closed Delta? Omicron leaves system, person hypothetically somewhat immune Delta? Yes, lot spread US arrived Europe. already multiple introductions US west coast trace Chinese origin February.

The cat bag already.  Unfortunately, believe may already here. negative covid result mean covid free, dormant. tell go shot. One shot easy rolling log. Guardian picked Yeah masks definitely cheaper Gottleib retweets: ""With 15 people two flights South Africa confirmed COVID, although variant known now, absolutely way virus countries travel bans."" -500 social credits. modern Greek, seems Xi usually prounounced 'ksee', 'ee' English 'meet'.

Which sounds quite similar Xi pronounced Xi Jinping. see skip it. Straight no-trolling question: understand works. selective pressure deadly variants occur, virus becoming lethal, causing deaths, yet seems cause infection, although people vaccinated?

AFAIK personal experience contagion like flu, end incubation period always disease spreading time frame. would virus different? Genuine question there. Good learning company is. A+

But hope aware fact one earn money valuable work society time. I'm familiar. Fill in? Regardless point, countries South Africa apparently vaccine use due people wanting vaccinated insufficient capacity deliver it

Thus patent thing red herring Same. Black fucking Friday. WITNESS MEEEEEEEE! ever thought maybe closed border faster time due backlash recieved close fast enough data public Omnicron variant? one saying closing border faster data way proving that.  virus mutates fast. force people things want, that's selfish. needs vaccinate danger, everyone every x months, foolish ain’t fucking taking another booster till year now. mines last week. I’ll take chances. Yes I've lived NL aware 😊 mean international news, significant far spread could coming days countries also say firetruck virus. Firetruck right buttonhole. interest guys referred Gotlieb etc level headed Ah new Nu variant I'm taking wait see approach data, poster quoted point - governments across world responded variant light speed compared previous variants, there's probably something there. u/banano_tip 1 Years government practice Also like Delta found boosting enough. [Also posted ""Covid misinformation spreads many Americans awful math"". Bold prediction. 

In next days panic ensue, lockdown called (likely enacted) tighter restrictions imposed countries.

In next 2-4 weeks found bad expected (good), expected vaccine also works hospitalization variant (also good).

In days/weeks data comes out, news die down.

3-4 months that, cycle repeat new variant. mean he’s another Eric Feigl Topol? least Omicron Persei 8. Yeah I'm going back office January 10th nothing short announcement like going change it.   would like like Directory HR currently...  enough information make true conclusions probably closer Xmas. Well....that quick. Maybe much less deadly, ticket back normalcy. sure would keep delta spreading much, so, dangerous, could good, right? (I really know I'm talking about.) dont think point we'll ever done Covid learn live (re: vaccines &amp; social distancing). Damn going name kid Omicron.   drop _nu_ variant name? People go great lengths fearmonger days lol dry wit good sir. long sign medical DNR go hospital, I'm fine That’s hot take abortion  Americans don’t understand much densely populated everything Europe is. Huh? Human horn? ridiculous! would virile male like Lrrr need human horn? even know for! it, something you... put salad dressing? Thank you. new new virus strain article referring omicron? I'm rooting Delta beat thing dominance. C'mon Delta! going say: 2nd wave?! We’re wave 5 now, think. Back beginning covid, less deadly variants take best hope avoiding this. Could still happen afaik fixed ya Well feel pain now. Felt like 8-12 hour flu, though quite bad. first two doses breeze. pretty strong reaction, comparatively, booster. It’s estimated CDC half cases asymptomatic general asymptomatic. understand study saying ot trying explain all. 

Increased antibodies OFTEN means stronger immunity. However, people strong immunity low even undetectable antibodies. 

So means increased immunity would correlate increased antibodies. also means antibodies unreliable metric measure immunity.  may believe people wish stay perpetual state doomerism. know people aren’t immune compromised haven’t eaten restaurant since pre covid. flu shot. thing.  also extremely positive vaccines/boosters remain effective... It’ll keep happening  though? say government acting outside law find judicial power prevent illegal action, even government. Next variant Unicron. COVID eat entire planet. Good news.

So guy girl experimented lab created super mutant hsve compared Omricon.

The conclusion boosters would solve Omricon neutralised (which even confirmed) severe illness etc still preventable cells   Wait what? know travel EU allowed people without green pass putting others risk going around getting vaccine, stay hell away work  vax?  showing ER?  welp bottom priority list. kick outta bed someone else comes vaxxed un related covid needs it. That's Omicron wants think. Definitely, I'm British obviously speak medical vernacular seen treatment plans mild, moderate, severe critical covid patients. Viruses don’t want anything. They’re inanimate pieces genetic material. Viruses gonna virus. Give lockdowns, gotta go get boosters boys, let's go! think would've gone well China. That's literally point. people claim government cannot coerce population human rights like objective Truth, disagree say whatever want made up. still feel like sufficient.

A better system would countries forming kind quarantine bloc end letting people countries stopped travel affected areas. Like us banned china travel forgot Europe late.

We long time think better system. governments behave like one responsible single decision? need dump fool OP say problem anywhere else? Micron Micron children diseases cold like symptoms sometimes also present diarrhea. Diarrhea also one rare symptoms covid-19 2020.  isn’t going post-Covid world. It’s stay, whatever form takes. Interesting. sure answer question R value predict seem accurate fortelling spikes? basically free vaccine, no?

Bro-micron Variant Definitely. Shame stupidity doesn’t kill Oh know, trust me. 


I ended graduating Computer Engineer, first major Biochemist graduated Highschool lab technician degree. know body. 


But take numbers step step. want vaccines give us high degree immunity? course! target goal. first goal avoid people dying, course would like best shape possible. 


But unfortunately situation need agree absolute necessity right now, need worry dying. see numbers people dying reality one self person need one case end it: case. 


Yeah also terrified different effects have, going clothing reduced lung capacity. Honestly vaccine helps survive, that's good. 


I like ""No, fucking isn't"" origin thread. Cmon, yeah get it, want get immunity, need different layers understanding take good thing have. told PANIC! Alwayscelebratedforitsexcellencesssss point guess it’s choice risk  thought since beginning classified mild anything requiring supplemental oxygen? real life experience, overlap colloquial mild medical mild rather huge disparity? Genomic data year one least indicated European origin. We'd least probably avoided lot death Northeast, worst part Northeast overall general. Well get ass telling go fuck myself. I'm sorry vaccinated family members die, there's someone family vaccinated hospitalized, severe health issues. 

Breakthrough infections 90% time severe, that's plain fact. enough data, hopefully causes everyone get essentially mild cold provides immunity. knew I’d get downvoted anyway, majority doesn’t think anymore turn cnn fox nod head. agree guess one really knows sure whole thing seems little me. Swine flu cases corona virus USA day… don’t remember came about.. understand different virus freedoms seem restricted cases yeah 🤷🏼‍♂️ anyway thanks sharing man virus contagious delta, results asymptomatic infectious cases vaccinated individuals isn’t bad news vaccinated, could worst possible news unvaccinated immune compromised. unlikely syllable structure complex specific. case, nu problems English, French, Portuguese (ditto French), covers significant proportion people. 2 Hong Kong cases hospitalized received 2 Pfizer doses. knew I’d get downvoted anyway, majority doesn’t think anymore turn cnn fox nod head. agree guess one really knows sure whole thing seems little me. Swine flu cases corona virus USA day… don’t remember came about.. understand different virus freedoms seem restricted cases yeah 🤷🏼‍♂️ anyway thanks sharing man quite lot excess deaths considering population average age That's interesting statement considering 2 Hong Kong cases received Comirnaty. accidentaly read ""new virus"" really skipped beat  drink semen? Well happened yet.  deliver data rapidly :) people sat 2020 we’d done shit now.  actually half wrong efficacy used either meaning efficacy protection non infection typically means ideal lab controlled sample. Since real world ideal non-vaccinated variant mutations infer second meaning. Source. think case better overreact repeat Delta, even wild type SARS CoV-2.

They can't stop anyway, already EU Israel, confirmed. Surely already US, expect see confirmed next 48 hours.

The unfortunate thing stories little known new variant genetic sequencing comparative analysis existing variants.

It may even worse, again, better much front slow transmission Omicron info becomes available buy much time possible formulate appropriate response.  cats dogs sleeping together... MASS HISTERIA! know yet point.

They made clear state infections among younger crowd, variant detected Nov 9 means 2 weeks pass.

Normally deaths complications lag 3 weeks heavily depends age group.

I hoping well, celebrating hopeful news clear yet great thing do. hope badly less deadly, know 1 2 months, fair good data 3 4 weeks make good guesses. Right know zero. binds cells well delta least expect lead less severity. 

The major cluster data young people. don’t think covid tests pick 12 hour old infection.  Malaise-free Malaysia. sick reported like 90% initially? Dang bad... That’s said. stop profiting vaccines poor countries afford them? way would stop getting many variants need many vacc... wait minute... would ideal bypasses antibodies variants believe hit quite hard people. Saw that. Damn. Pfizer's still looking good, though. provide fucking proof? No, Delta higher chance death hospitalization per person.  Yeah. mutations direction dominates, disease would another flu. office space renting multi-year leases. Companies paying offices used. guess. …against Alpha  What’s stopping living normally past year? haven’t lockdowns long time. did. don’t think data showed Delta deadlier, way transmissible. Omega 3, 6 9. Despite millions playing Plague Inc, one could known become eligible booster 6 months 2nd shot 6 months fully vaxxed (2 weeks later)?  Yes, one earlier ones (I think Gamma?) one hallmarks. it’s longer percent (like sub 5%) cases since Delta came along. also read earlier today small number Delta subtypes too, it’s common (something like 1%.)

Point being, yes used proxy sequencing. number tests show gene deletion jump 5% 20%+, it’s good indicator something happening. Whew. Thank God it’s one. Way nip bud! that's right? assume I'm gonna fine drive work everyday difference die accident there's group internet assholes celebrate death mock personal risk assessment.

Do make fun people cut fingers cooking too? doctor explains risks surgery go bad outcome? people idiots too? still variant interest isnt it? stopped cardio gym home now, strength training gym, tolerable mask. 

I cardio month mask kinda sucks. sweat, mask gets sweaty, yucky. like can't breathe, get fresh air breathing. understand coming remember, external selective pressures taking place pay load virus tiny. mutation, working towards becoming virulant strains require sacrifice point genetic code majority time leads less stable virus dies out.Unfortunately whole world form virus becomes increasing likely role 20 die land 6 speak. Ironically social distancing probably number 1 contributor mutations happening, ofcourse social distancing still important, unfortunate sideeffect. Still explain skipped Xi. Repost mean waving vaccine licenses like they’ve begging us last six months? Yep, screeching close borders gonna damn thing. like movies.  still spread around you’re vaccinated. I’m home getting I’m fully vaccinated. may lie certainly billions dollars incentives so. may also mistake science product learning process. may true. Can't trust governments lied beginning saying masks work, aerosol transmission, etc. I’m working negative. It’s challenging. completely wrong. 

The primary endpoint efficacy vaccines protection infection. Almost every single vaccine designed prevent infection. Fauci came said line thinking comment wrong. test lot (our testing labs actually saturated work done). new variant specific markers appears standard PCR test apparently. Mental illness God's name anyone traveling much right now????? left county 18 months bit woman traveling continents??? fuck?  Sounds kind like vaccine, no? yeah, bring on! Israel let us know 2 weeks Honestly, it’s probably already there. 1 case Belgium - know of. means what, 10, 100 cases don’t know (yet). Sputnik one encouraging, given many people tried claim ineffective.

Hopefully, people Russia see decide get vaccinated. destroy You’re right, absolutely ridiculous backed scientific fact blame people point. 

We could listened vaccinated Africa, noooooo need hoard vaccines ourselves. could listened kept wearing masks indoors, noooooo we're invincible vaccinated we're rich white people. 

Most places Europe US even installed inexpensive HEPA filtration, mine-boggling. Never There's nothing suggest new variant produces false negatives AFAIK.

Whether that's case not, [the first test results flight flight Cape Town tarmac next apparently 15 testing positive 110 results released, positivity rate 13.6%. full numbers yet, whether among them. im going real dissapointed next variant isnt called ""Jesus Christ Crutch!"" ""Hooooly Fucking Moses"" yikes, US going test south african passengers coming weekend? could easily hundreds cases , looks like several flights en route wondered yet hear good explanation. way people talking ""outcompete"" seems indicate strains spreading different rates, one strain actually preventing spread another strain. must something specific properties COVID, two different strains HIV (HIV-1 HIV-2) coexisted long time. Can't even make Prince Phillip joke.  People fuss lot things regarding younger children, bronchitis drowning accidents poisonings correct car seat. Some, like cars, deadly covid, less. 

With cars though keep mind deaths egregious risk factor like speeding alcohol use lack seat belt.

Ah yes, hiding pertinent information could potentially affect entire world. Fantastic strategy. would really make people trust governments improve relations countries.   Nuthing much here. Crossing fingers it’s deadly, contagious.. positive, guess could try cook them, vaccinate rest /s scary thing. variant that’s way infectious doesn’t make people sick (or even symptomatic) spread faster infect way people. Even evades vaccines and/or pre-existing immunity. = countless opportunities mutate knows comes that. like mom got strep throat? Sounds like new sexual position Seems unlikely. considering first principles, replication life cycle would substantively different since viruses use host machinery replicate, doubling time unlikely different. Anything immune compromise something going need discuss medical provider. mean lot different things. binary one size fits approaches take. Solid organ transplant cancer/general chemo? Yeah stay home isolate foreseeable future. serious risk death. Low dose steroids controlled hypertension? Technically there's probably immune compromise, probably issue especially booster. Everything going require medical knowledge advise appropriately, Reddit. make clear U.S.A. restricting South Africa, restrict countries reported cases new variant??  capitalism, individuals.

There individuals assign leadership roles. 

If holding ball get blamed fumble.  3831 base pairs protein SARS-CoV-2. 30 mutations may affect current vaccines, certainly starting scratch means.

Additionally, *lot* uncertainty original vaccines included need test delivery vectors/platforms, etc. Modern Pfizer/Biontech indicated ability begin testing new variant-specific vaccine within couple months. can’t even get enough staff hospitals, let alone add surge capacity. many quitting due burnout. cruel reality worse things get worse terms able handle future waves. Also well agree long vaccine efficacy drop significantly, right. vaccine efficacy drops significantly due new variant, would option go back 2020 level precautions. Healthcare system strained due labor shortage, can't handle bump like all. assume near town town. get new information variant update day day activities like already immediate threat, especially infecting vaccinated higher rate. government USA abide another shut down. sacrifice economy. well smart. I’m part latest moderna trial. full trial takes 22 months. first trial didn’t end applied EUA. one won’t either omicron kill many people vaccine designed specifically target widely available. dominant variant within 2 months, possibly even one month. one said evade vaccines. Everything I’ve read says vaccines still effective, though possibly reduced. I'M LURR Antivirals deliver us extent (doubtfully) evades immune response vaccination.

What??!!! works guess.  Gotta wonder countries shows in, mandatory 2 week quarantines?   Perhaps. initial reports seem indicate mild symptoms/disease. Time tell.... [“Perhaps need outside universal threat make us recognize common bond,” Reagan told diplomats planet. “I occasionally think quickly differences worldwide would vanish facing alien threat outside  Oh boy love us. sample ~1000 positive tests fully sequenced week Netherlands. [latest first week November, shows 100.0% Delta strain.

The surge near perfect exponential growth stable reproduction number 1.2, past month half.

Nothing data suggests delta currently dominant strain.    feels like hard figure perfect/correct dosing regimen is, really that's because... one, nobody's really trying find it.

Higher doses provoke stronger immune response. time doses also provokes stronger response. Two small doses time gap better one big dose. There's lots factors.

The real reason various protocols ""because that's tested."" Pfizer 2x30mg 4 weeks apart Moderna 2x100mg 3 weeks apart? that's tested worked. Moderna looks effective now, gave Pfizer's vaccine Moderna's dosing schedule, might actually better! UK, people waited like 3 months doses, vaccines worked better people follow recommended schedule. change schedules? Because... that's tested.

Changing schedules would require clinical trials, regulatory approval, etc. *works*, there's real incentive go time effort money tinker works already. 

You got booster. fine. Might waiting 100mg availability better? Maybe... got COVID waited. 

From public-health perspective hard problem optimize. personal perspective, ""get whatever vaccine get soon get it"" pretty straightforward, nad works. upcoming wave might evade vaccines antibodies?  Time stop flights. vaccines work? actually get world vaccinated. rich countries throwing away shots antivaxxers wouldn’t take, people threw shit fits “murica first” mention sending shots abroad poorer countries. mutations occurring places vaccination rates low 20%.

We chance wave intellectual property laws distribute vaccines globally… blame capitalism, individuals. could possibly make many assumptions? New rona rollin' like Limp Bizkit shouting ""GIMME SOMETHING BREAK!"" son took 4 tests get positive PCR, act Covid. you? media reddit users focusing amplifying scaremonger stories? Link? Well, whole thing following predictable cycle. 

1) Virus mutates ""contagious potentially highly damaging/lethal""

2) one previous immunity similar enough deal it, enough people it.

3) Make physical suppression measures

4) ""I like suppression measures""

5) Make vaccine

6) ""I like vaccine!""

7) Get told it

8) Don't

9) Go step 1.

At point cycle break. People stupid step 4, 6 8.

Condition 2 likely cycle breaker. People get vaccinated, get sick, die. endemic immunity, might take years get there. ever going end? feels like every single time restrictions start lessened, another variant discovered everything shut again. I'm tired put life hold. almost 2 years end sight. Bruh Variant Go away troll  live South Africa, specifically Cape Town; huge shock, especially tourism industry/wine farms. hope year industry would recover.

From understand discovered mean originated here.

All international flights departing needed PCR test maximum 24 hours old (or something) boarding. stringent requirements even begin think getting plane. news quite shocker, think world general.

Then, course, Mayor criticising rapid alert world Tourism. Lol. don’t give flying fuck. 2 doses fucking Moderna still restrictions. bullshit point. box masks goes ass tomorrow. Cheers Finland. It’s true lol. something learn AP Bio… isn’t fact trade evolving contagious deadly, virus evolve both. Im sure tried like hell surely last 2ish years hard find people willing subject that. Especially given majority hospitalizations done nothing stop contracting virus. Sorry took post Rule 2. Hope well. First need mask mandate, advisory. way hospitals filling up, lockdown may thing relieve pressure. Going real shit show next two weeks. Got Pfizer Boost past Monday. feel pretty good odds 'the covids'... unvaccinated US kept Covid rates much higher be, people gather indoors holidays Covid spread otherwise would be. 

if everyone vaccinated Covid rates would low nearly concerned upcoming wave right now. stopped hoarding toilet paper? /s

In seriousness there’s reason think it’s here, least NYC. No. It’s already out-competed delta regions it’s found. Omicron contagious. 50% originally Moderna, thinking Pfizer ""just take cation guess""

O thank you, great one! Good luck, friend.  obviously twitter early stages pandemic videos people literally dropping dead streets Wuhan body bags piling outside apartment complexes. could've easily Europe US taken protective measures did, time hands (although move nearly fast enough). selfish people can't bothered taking action making small sacrifice protect others horrific potential hellscape. reliant rest us carry burden. Long-term protection result ""natural infection"" tricky quantify. vary quite bit depending severity infection. yes, correct people infected also get one dose vaccine seem produce robust immunity.

But worry! us previously infected got vaccine(s), recent studies shown still benefit long term T-cell protection! think Penn study August showed mRna vaccines elicited strong response CD4 T-cells (these cells produce antibodies) CD8 T-cells (these killer cells wipe virus). even Omicron able avoid neutralizing antibodies elicited vaccine regimen, body still tools defeat it. may still get sick, likelihood severe disease remains low!  old man I'm happy say felt nothing three Moderna shots got though know people did. Netherlands, must negative test traveling high risk countries, whether vaccinated. airlines make rules. yes....

properly universally worn masks goes long way too

[This first large-scale randomized evaluation demonstrate effectiveness masks real-world setting. wait governmentsee make mistakes.

I idea I'm agreeing but, too. ever happened would due irresponsible authorities power complex. valid reason ever go back measures vaccines place, therapeutics way fact virus already wide spread. variant variant. proven ""deadlier"" what's already around. feasible end-goal shutdown, shelter place measures. F-Shirts, friends two arms side! We’re going anywhere here. Agree disagree. support wearing mask. never unless required (flying / trains only). business enforces go elsewhere. variant actually gives distinct PCR signature normal test. test amplifies 3 genes one site needed detection mutated 2/3 amplify one doesn’t amplify protein. one way look spread backwards time even without genome sequencing vaccinated traveling ways, plain wrong. Since way through, waves actually furthering progress pandemic. great cost. That’s nice thought friend 70 years old, immune suppressing drugs manage debilitating lifelong arthritis. She’s 4 shots body reacting doses all.  Unfortunately agree. Thanks! Can't wait governmentsee make mistakes.   Omicron vanish, overnight one day wake say it’s gone. Oh... really need /s end? According NYT reporter one flights, everyone teated flight tested negative. Break what? can't go live life right now? find still need something dry though bidet. use toilet paper? know people use cloth towels that's even grosser toilet paper. That's issue. rate spread seen suggests spreading even 28 days. reason think would go undetected. South Africa sequences pretty good portion cases. Cases start rising approximately 11 days ago (they've risen 4-fold time based country-wide 7 day average). Lastly, Omicron detectable many PCR tests, traced backwards shows prevalence prior roungly November 21st, straight line 50, fully vaccinated boosted immune compromised. What’s concern?  Title chose click bait hell.

He sounds like virologist epidemiologist trying freak people hospitalization. haven’t tasted smelled food 13 months think think mutations like Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles. Baby turtles mutate talking humanoid physically strong creatures totally dissimilar original form.

The differences Omicron previous variants small you’ll need precise subatomic instruments measure them.

The variant similar enough current Covid tests detect it, logic follows vaccines measure effectiveness it. variant infectuous needed specific booster still take months happen. Mathematical models pandemic spread show there's little functional difference little initial spreading lot initial spreading long least infected people areas. outcome roughly exponential growth kicks in. unlikely border shutdowns really much think. start handing good drugs shove thing arm. possible think know enough yet tell. Omicron, largest coronavirus, simply eat coronaviruses? Go abroad anyway. might surprise different different countries. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I hope shut fuck up. remember thinking east coast trip see friend numbers cooling down.

I wanted 4 self-tests. One night before, one plane, one plane, another next night.

People don’t give fuck boggles mind. One women unvaxxed hadn’t caught virus knowledge. Imagine rolling dice. Good god. Yeah, definitely makes sense. Sucks many 61 people apparently got inaccurate results, guess really know % people took tests. delta vaccines affective it? RULER PLANET OMICRON PERSEI 8 Hopefully mostly infected omicron. means new variant mild many got still travel flights. moderna booster half dose IIUC. Nope. gonna wear mask social distance anymore. Also muddying variable fact 20% SAs population HIV+ likely immunocompromised (both response virus response vaccines) world population. Yup, graphs stuff problem. We're looking growth rate new variant based 2-3 days data likely spreading weeks comparing another variant very, cases country. Omicron became dominant south africa like 80 confirmed cases context. 


Omicron also far, far easier confirm cases compared delta. Delta sequenced lab takes days, omicron literally confirmed PCR test likely every single case omicron gets tested confirmed omicron everyone likely missing massive amounts delta cases assuming alpha whatever dominant time. Yeah number vaccines need boosters wear while. Tetanus every ten years example. unvaccinated. Thanks! That's genetically informative, tho emphasize yet much data variant acts.

In particular, analysis fails cover vaccination status mention none known symptomatic cases thus far fully vaccinated people (as half day ago, IIRC). example, breakthrough case Hong Kong asymptomatic patient hospitalized HK takes *all* cases hospital containment + monitoring.

Given vaccines provide 90-99% reduction severe cases, I'm waiting least moderately symptomatic breakthrough cases considering data worth panicking over. I'm epidemiologist cautious observation warranted given bad covid variants could get.  wife grew poor buys lot good brand good discount.

A store match every promo stores mess buys year.

It´s good high quality paper cheaper sandpaper one later rolls.  wonder Omicron variant's mutations could impact rapid test's sensitivity mutations going alphabetical order like hurricanes? someone tell E,F,GHIJKLMN variants called? I'll give hint. People still flying trump 2016, 2020 2024 flags Please Stock essentials!

We don’t need people panic buying toilet paper I’m embracing this! I’ve travelling throughout pandemic. Don’t let anyone shame going. multiple areas outbreak. 3 days ago Tswane Erkhuhuleni. Now, know.

I'm almost certain question  Sure slowing worthwhile goal. vaccines need updated need every day get! name ""robo"" it. Well said. everyone wearing them, mean want to. wear one time I'm - hate damn things dead afraid medical debt

you'd think republicans would too, literally experience doctor, guess they're lucky enough covid gets cause first medical bankruptcy job gettin hit head im gonna give break don’t look cross street?  I'm amazed one said it. tact mindfulness?

I DESTROY YOU! countries took around 5 weeks delta go 100 cases dominant variant. contagious delta might least two months takes world. Haaaaang everyone… let’s stop clutching pearls whole ‘vaccines might effective’ thing there’s EVIDENCE. it’s def already. question it. like beginning whole thing. NY doesn’t get hit first don’t know  idea work popular talking point among ignorant social media users.

AFAIK there's lot scepticism effectiveness Russia itself.  think lot questions data points like that. could mistakes bias sample test results collected vs reported happening mean increase great reality early graphs end twitter whatnot. seems based graph climbing percentage cases faster delta referring to. saw epidemiologist saying Twitter shouldn’t take graph face value lot targeted testing it, naturally would make go faster. still worried tho, things certainly don’t look good, seems early confident crazy numbers. 5x delta would pretty much infectious disease ever, there/higher measles. Lrr Oooooo new variant sooooo scawry!!!!  looked up. It’s one source one data pool. important semantic difference “probably” “supposedly”.

Supposedly infers assumption, antithetical scientific analysis aside null hypothesis.

Please careful spreading information.

We don’t know yet.   Crazy remember. nearly 2 years ago now. asymptomatic? gonna kill me, fucking already Good time buy toilet paper  Re: immune escape - Pfizer said lowers vaccine effectiveness 40% need tests. soon test antibody response? fauci cnn saying could pretty soon.

If actually evade immune response wonder long take reformulate mRNA vaccine target variant mass produce - assume full clinical trials required A380 carry 800 economy class config. case 2 planes already air flight ban announced. really insidious vibe. Greek letter, tho. **50-second window** closing door room case-patient C opening door room case-patients E. Therefore, hypothesized suspended aerosol particles probable mode transmission instance

That’s yikes me, dog.  January 2021 hearing new variant coming India... Bad feeling, schmeeling. Use buying op Yeah, Russian market tubled rest od world eh? Agreed, fueled politics sure. 

Also there’s peer pressure you’re one with/without mask. Many people tend go local style suppose unless religious it. Yes anyone rapid antigen test would boarded flight. line quote, editorializing. started buying today im saying world going end. Im saying new variant definitely worrisome used stock market proof. choice have? Stuck essentials, forget buy masks (the KN95 better ones), take care body pray (I'm even religious guess will). 

Drinking losing mind going help. Stay strong, we'll fine. *Fingers crossed* google this: Omnicron 500% infectious Delta. 100 days plus however long takes FDA/CDC equivalents countries give legal authorization. Still, Delta/Omicron shot Spring would awesome. happens still keep concert travel/road trip plans. This. remember numbers kept growing growing cruise point added initial trackers bad. Send DM then, don’t even know exactly google. much showing try. vaccine giving thing advantage? got JnJ June offered Moderna booster Oct. JnJ kicked ass 2 days, booster immediately felt light headed even worse symptoms 3 days! Sore arm took go ride!! No, see stories Iight imma head out. Mentally can’t handle thought over! Lol (s) yet. dragon rank. Unless, course, variant potential evade natural immunity, like Omicron suspected to.

From [World Health Organization meeting Preliminary evidence suggests increased risk reinfection variant, compared VOCs. Google it.  
The stupid bot reddit page let post links. 6 WEEKS? thought would several months. Damn, source that, gives hope. got feeling that's Chinese felt beginning too. Yes. Read latest NY times. won’t fully evade vaccines. Columbus seems stuff together it? I've enjoyed visiting there. Live small town east Cleveland. Big divide cities everywhere else suspect. Fucking chill people. SMH. No, 30% reduction hospitalization 89% reduction death (1vs9) honest answer would 1) long ago boosted 2) going?
Vaccine seems wane real fast, even boosters demonstrated israel. 0-4 months seems best spot. 4-8 still protected, less so. seems like 8-11 months anti body count starts falling threshold (though can’t remember exactly threshold was.) 

Also, 45% hospitalized Germany vaccinated. dont assume protected. Always take precautions.

And variant Russian roulette. data yet whether vaccines effective pfizer made statement saying expect vaccine way less effective prove right, modify current vaccine target new variant.  know panic right crazy didnt also kind panic variant delta nothing really happened? Dumb question....aren't people required show negative test getting airplane another country?  Unlikely happened 12 hours. 

I know someone left Germany US yesterday test negative day get plane. Good perspective, thanks thoughts. Omg sensationalism. helping people. I've hoarding tp since 2011. long fear running out. (From childhood poor)  Okay. I’ve taken pandemic seriously. spent 12 months alone. Got vax ASAP. Always wear mask. booster becomes available. barely leave home anyways besides holiday travel next month. news comes variant may need ANOTHER booster for. bother get booster? I’m pro science think multiple boosters within line 2-3 months begins concern me. don’t trust government all. don’t know. want right thing tried, I’m confused. get booster new variant evades it? seriously risk shots? I’m young, asthma. don’t know need guidance. “That’s BINGO!” land rest us survive decade 🤷‍♂️ call Corona+... Corona Max? people need get tested fly? Sure develop covid 13.6% seems crazy high considering everyone tested flew. funny thing fractions everybody gets four fourths life. shall see simply trust officials comes holding end bargain removing them.

I don’t understand all. Why? precedent gives fear? government give damn wear face. wanted force people wear something, never even attempted suggested before? mention it’s arguably even interests people walk around masks makes people harder identify. sure HELL don’t interest forcing people stay home. People staying home horrible government. badly hurts economy that’s like #1, 2, 3 thing people power want avoid. 

And that’s besides obvious, heaviest restrictions public freedoms living memory, pretty much gone areas. 

Seriously hell would ever want keep restrictions, want hear explanation. Unbelievable. pay $19.50 hour bill patients (if leave pesky decimal point.) medical system deeply broken nobody even know say - even “we want make things slightly better” party barely mentions anymore. Well thing bad feared able ignore it.

Hope basic measures vaccines hold worst it. Ohio's vaccine coverage trash.

Good luck. feel bad you. kids younger (16 18) fallen major depression last year know college look like them, ever able move house. wise words old Gen X lady hopes like hell find way past younger people chances explore did. treated staff like garbage expect? Treat people like they’re expendable they’ll leave keep leaving Fauci said Unvaccinated need get booster shots go get also needs happen major big vaccine companies need give vaccines 3rd world countries thats alot variants coming much tell unvaccinated isnt personal choice choice impacts everyone hold major companies standard get want make money pandemic might go longer needs keep trying strong arm countries dont got money vaccines Probably much faster like yearly flu vaccine. think state emergencies flight bans cute theatre. variant find way around Earth wants to. remaining thing see well new kid block compete delta. point start demanding reparations China? gone long enough decimated economies worldwide. chinese pay this? Unfortunately, government consider Covid dangerous enough make serious changes things done. Otherwise, could trained millions people handle Covid year ago many workers instead few. Hey. Use money invest future. Purchase various investments. No. spike protein look like spike protein ad infinum regardless mutations.

If mutated look different wouldn’t able infect Ace 2 receptors.   Thank explanation -- clear, plain-English answer. appreciate taking time write it. area saw vaccinated hospitalizations shoot fall, finally start declining boosters came out. There’s lot severe sickness decent number vaccinated people fall behind boosters.  Yeah I’m denying that. point it’s early yet let data determine conclusions. said, I’m watching one closely definitely concerned. hardly blame them. God, wish could award comment. Fort Smith help us  hardly blame them. obvious vaxxed creating variants spreading it. Travel ban applies non-citizens non-permanent residents. I'm traveling South Africa US Monday Delta seems plan continuing flights normal.  Nah. You’re right. 2-3% isn’t much. 

Let’s check back week two. may overreaction, hope is. things snowball. 2-3% becomes 10%, quickly, you’re bear market. 

Again, hope it’s one day, knee jerk reaction new version Coronavirus nothing worse we’ve seen. Delta saw action, terrible huge part population. February 2020 news virus first hitting Pacific Northwest Didn’t people threads say curbs political spread probably already there? Make mind /r/Coronavirus  think general article scientists detect COVID variants published July, updated yesterday newest variant. assure you, news breaking yesterday. looks like cases stabilized 1/4 delta peak. us barely dipped 1/2 it’s climbing again. good willing except coincidence super spreader event spread mutated spike protein seen pandemic (nearly double second place...), spread brand new variant, variant already made 90% cases area, marked first increase around 3 months... still admit super spreader event led community spread (quarantine hotel infection Hong Kong, someone infected traveling Egypt, 0 year old infected SA)  idea big are- ordered online ship. ""Omnicron""? would ever end? hard enough eradicate people wild animal populations too. Short sci-fi technological breakthrough can't conceive path eradication. I'd love read one. I'm director HR suppose like lot companies.  company lacks culture one ever sees other.   I'm older employee know job well enough well home....but remote thing difficult kids coming first jobs, people trying form relationships new new roles.

Short term lights kept long term full remote never worked well companies ones tried prior pandemic....only find hard way something lost.   Fucking insane.

Meanwhile current staff gets shafted bit. infected woman Belgium never traveled south Egypt. strain certainly widespread Southern Africa.  There's lot IP standing way making mrna vaccines anyone already similar work. Barn doors WIDE OPEN usual. Madagascar closed ports yet? tell unvaxxed brothers go suck vent leave alone. Lol Haha- Imnot guy stockpiling considered many exactly? Restricting travel little impact virus already country. I'm 22 middle depressive episode. Coronavirus rising house costs fucking up. finally enough money travel like always wanted literally save life stuck fucking PANDEMIC! 20 started i'm 22 now. I'm getting younger! Everyone loves Pooh! 😩  Animals always diseases. every virus we've ever encountered, came animals. Goddamnit! Jesus fucking Christ- can’t take much more.
I saw picture 10/2019 looked carefree, riding electric scooter downtown way art exhibit.
I look like hag one hears bullshit, one say ""Brazil's Bolsonaro"" would assume would easier variants?  date seem get worse.....although far big way  think seen variants less deadly last. makes feel better, multiple variants never even assigned greek letters. reserve ones worth identifying  New York.

Since variant will/will arrived outside US, logically expect first found international travel hubs. Last heard Mu also assumed Nu. guess already Nu Xi?  work like that. low levels spread variant arises random. get founder effects look like this. fact virus spreading Gauteng may nothing properties variant, behavior there, something else (possibly 6 month waxing waning virus people go careful careful). increase spread amplifies whatever variant lucky enough there.

The test comes variant introduced areas lots Delta spread (Michigan somewhere like that).

Delta may also reseed Guateng take again, right faces competitive disadvantage simply Omicron head start now. vax ""against Delta"". major vaccines distributed today targeted towards vanilla COVID strain. Hey I'm reporting NBC reporting.  crazy given spread deer live don’t move across states countries.

And don’t socialize regularly humans get infected them.

Almost unimaginable. must getting humans state rather spreading deer deer across USA. need less deadly Covid.  kill many overall takes long time really selective pressure become less deadly.  covid worst them.... Lol mask free since May 2020. Life lot better without constantly living fear! Bring downvotes. There's evidence significant severe sickness Covid leading long-term issues. magically appear variant product wild imaginations. die car accident even seat belts air bags. mean things useless. I'm 22 looking like going entire portion adult life could going fun.  Yeah, rapid spread mostly. lot mutations new, well researched. could cut ten understand, sequences would still immediately flagged highly concerning. Here's tweet:  think people really afraid deal 2020 again, fuels media machine wants clicks views. actually going force stop scrolling cannot handle way people writing this. crying evening reading anxiety high. clue actual worry, people proactive. low key, red eyes sounds little cool lol even Facebook point? Facebook plague humanity. level misinformation spread regards Covid alone astonishing. Like right sigh breath relief protagonist walk towards sunset end one saga, pan big boss behind first one. don’t think domestic flights require test. country country, yeah probably required. Yes. sigh. Also, ""Nu"" sounds quite close ""new"", might another thing causes confusion. I'm saying 70 still large number, compared started 1. 

P681H used dominate lot world Alpha, also key mutation Mu, present lower levels Gamma C.1.2. Yes, Delta appears useful P681R mutation, confirmed vitro experiments, like mutation instead P681H Delta outcompeted variants easily. 

A lot mutations Omicron studied previously, give variants advantages. levels coincidence layering first heavily heavily mutated variant immunocompromised patient gets sequenced also one gets seeded superspreader event rather dominant variant region, also superspreader event leads couple weeks sustained growth months decline.. TIL FSM many variants lately? 

South Africa, USA Belgium New strain dropped dudes evidence booster actually useful infection covid? nice since CDC isn’t recommending 18+? ineffective. may less effective milder disease still protective severe disease. We’ll know weeks. Meanwhile, get booster protect family current threat (delta). Whether new vaccine might needed new variant irrelevant decision. stocked mask hands sanitizer everytime see sale. r/fragilewhiteredditor Lots places California also don’t precautions new strain dropped fr fr cap skipped Xi. joke! Thank sweet comment. half expecting little kid run someone robotically say, ""Protocol Omega"", awhile now. # almost like they're purpose. entire 2020. flight attendant affected January saw mess coming. Everyone thought overreacting saying something big happening. telling 70 year old mother important getting vaccinated (spoiler: get vaccinated subsequently suffered horribly). experience surreal infuriating. one around listens. Hugs you. It’s rough there, take vacation time can. can’t fill people tanks running empty ourselves. got this. TOO. kid almost 20. Graduated May 2020. Highest honors world open him..until closed. heartbreaking parent see. will, hopefully, lots great experiences ahead. us past days life understand kids missed. 

Absolutely people lost throughout pandemic. heart breaks them. I'm trying take away loss. trauma lost formative years.

Hugs parents slugging nightmare hoping better kids side (assuming one..) tried 10-15 minutes weed garbage internet find US sequence surveillance rate best could 1.6% cases 9 months ago. idea current rates? better resource google? need swift action  Rarely viruses mutate become virulent, often mutate increase pathogenicity. would genuinely surprised broke norm. grateful support internet hugs. Thanks empathy encouragement. Take care family. Nu Corona afraid remove things go wrong, they’ll face massive backlash.

they afraid this, every time remove restrictions results another wave like Damn really got downvoted ppl read user Thank friend. get this. vaccine requirement air travel period us companies always remote first CoVID happy continue attract sometime gently poach influence people companies like one stated thread above. Hang friend. It’s rough there. Fill tank first, can’t fill others isn’t full.  believe rules returning citizens residents always easier. visitor may face mandatory quarantine quite often countries face milder restrictions. That…. Doesn’t quite add up. There’s still covid there. totally new virus I’d understand you’re coming from. isn’t true all. live France. suggesting drastic measures, shouldn’t say “just line boosters” spike protein shots designed significantly changed. 

We need learn asap prepared additional measures reinforcing place I'm amazed one even tried make video explaining cytokine storm immune system nuking vital organs. except add divorce fun. left us covid kids missed senior year, prom, online college nightmare we’re stuck crappy rental can’t buy house. kids well all. Nope. last line defense. Masks, distancing etc… important vaccines. going get downvoted making presumption based facts. know far, vaccines still effective variant. Definitely reminds transformer, guess accurate. heart goes both, get know it. live Washington state. wear masks public establishments. state in? Got old Unfortunately incredibly accurate. families tell us them. feel way. feels different compared variants, including delta. hope gut feeling wrong. Ah shit go cope  someone explain mask phobia me?

I honestly get it, anxiety/mental health thing? 

It means absolutely nothing putting mask busy train something. give fuck, barely even notice it. appears ~70 percent rate samples Michigan. Studies Iowa high 80 percent (link another comment) many states seem rate around 30 literally got partner back week ago. separated travel bans year half. bans come right back job (events/tourism related) gone visa renewal won’t happen it’s over. got back fucking week ago. You’re probably fine mean not? Unless abnormally bad reaction vaccine imo max possible immunity level? main reason I’m getting healthy 27 y/o lower chances vector spread virus someone might day. feel like healthy people really others instead think that’s great thing gonna use saltwater risk getting eaten type barnacle every time gotta go.

One knows 3 seashells for.  Note positive cases get sequenced. heard UK, something like 1% countries, much less. picked one Omicron case assume more.  Mark words, going work. Vaccines important variant extremely different. Probably even real thing going catch variant. I’m sure get downvoted hell don’t believe unicorns. Real question: test new variant? testing new variant? Would know here? couple months doesn’t breakthrough vaccinated people. otherwise gg weeks say anything boosters. wanted say statement often due lack logistics willing populations holding back, supply.

I also gave data showing wrong.  KKKKHHHHAAAANNNN!!!! South Africa's test positivity rate like 2%.

Both numbers can't right. Coronavirus-positive travelers self-selecting demographic board plane together. 14% airplane passengers infected, similar figure must apply general population came from. sister took Covid rapid tests, probably antigen-based rapid tests PCR tests. Different brands antigen rapid tests use different antibodies targeting different viral epitopes. possible, unlikely, Omikron might trigger positive rapid test. flu 8 different possible segments genome, different segments combine creating new strains, it’s virus family.

For colds different coronaviruses rhinoviruses completely.

It genome virus disease causes. 

If virologists collectively determine new strain sufficient genetically different new virus. 

Really species names viruses complicated viruses aren’t living species. Generally species determined various number pathogenicity factors.

SARS-CoV-1 gives disease acute respiratory distress syndrome, spreads exponentially less alpha coronavirus. means even better cause undetected cases, less dangerous is. real way mutant progression severity danger. means there's mutation. Evolution never stops, long COVID exists new strains. Look flu, example. False negative PCR results vary timeline. Within first 5 days infection 67% false negative. day 5 it’s closer 20%. You’re 100% correct though. Act if.. 600 passanegers check, around 110 checked. thats around 90 people infected. able share link? get removed automod? looking live updates page didn’t see it. Yes, that's exactly I'm saying. exceptional circumstances world right would make mandating everyone get vaccinated virus killed millions made hundreds millions sick anything like that. Definitely letting governments run rampant controlling people's every action normal lives people consistently dying every day thousands anything like that. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  exhausted this… Omicron came US consider safe country (Chile, 90%+ vaccinated, boosters campaign, people wear mask np, strict COVID-19 protocols) holy shit, want go back ASAP.

Nobody wears mask, protocol enforcements, even getting vaccine free easy shit (the thing deliver home jab), people don’t care. mall fucking full. even heard Q?????? Same. Although many cases now, seems like it’s moving fast. Lot restrictions stuff coming quickly time too. Feels eerie Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m pretty sure VAERS (I think that’s acronym) say, it’s mandatory reporting system vaccine side effects graph made shoddy data. didnt start 0 2 weeks ago, 3 months given mutations take time develope. said Prof Balloux. 

Also, barely Delta infections anymore left, much outcompete. speedier they’re basically already phase 2/3. FDA clears study order study large sample size like phase 2/3, prove science dosage phase 1. would make sense changed mrna encode different spike protein lipid nanoparticle vehicle mrna stayed well dosage FDA would clear mrna studies phase 2/3 based results original phase 1. don’t work medical research field though don’t actually know sure South Africa fairly notable seroprevalence despite low vaccination numbers - indicating high levels natural immunity. explosion cases Omicron could purely bypasses previously acquired immunity. 

The R0 value could far Delta’s, without protection infection resulting reduction R0, outcompetes Delta.

I’m sure you’ve read theories since you’re educated contributor. one happens favourite though, would explain massive growth. Wow  vaccinated people still tested, use contact tracing apps wear masks. like people thought wasn’t January 2020. Hilarious 40-60k people moving China Oregon Washington CA group PER WEEK pre Covid. case count remarkably high lately Michigan, assumed going hear new variant within weeks. thing happened Florida delta. Cases started spike science community comes podium new Greek letter. Stay safe ""Me? I'm careful."" Politics aside, upset community hold single monolithic opinion every issue? Sounds like familiar approach groups.... moderna stock went 20%... coincidence lol mean CDC, lol? Multiple studies corroborate makes perfect medical sense case, think even think topic really, Delta subsided may offset level antibody protection population + much recent vaccination/lower levels waning immunity - unless Omicron really ridiculous level immune escape. People selfish. Yes many board feeling well  epsilon? miss variants? seem lot letters delta omicron.. Yea idk I'm downvoted. feel already getting increasing breakthrough cases due waning vacine efficacy. Priority booster shots given older people received Sinovac. Thanks handing thanks around. fetal death?

Sounds bad.

I thought fatal deaths worst got thinking. good news scientists kept separate public get discouraged. medical staff deal patients screaming they're actually healthy nothing wrong. Seriously people already taking granted become dominant focusing whether vaccines work. reality idea far it’ll spread. Beta dominant SA worldwide prefer harass giving vaccines instead. omegalul, destroyer humanity many fear mongering posts sudden. Something sus. wasn’t free release actually pretty barebones crappy. released tons updates free years eventually became great. completely anecdotal, regardless high alert fellow Man's Sky addict myself, confidently state game never free. Though ups downs terms pricing. critically slammed upon release half-finished game barely anything do. Nowadays, many updates, features initially promised game developers appear extremely dedicated fulfilling wishes players extra cost. good game now, release good. aren’t eating drinking top other. one person infection front plane one person back weakened immune system, it’s better wear reduce odds matter what. you’re correct, food doesn’t permeate masks. ffs time around really like common cold. They'll continue fuck common people someone can't blame things turn sour. like Hu's new leader China joke back 2000s ... TBH, kind figured happen. many reasons. 

If humanity become extinct, asteroid, tiny, microscopical bug. Hollow phrases. absolutely guarantee still situation time user gets 24 25 years old. hundreds thousands scientists world working ways beat thing.

In first year pandemic saw maturation widespread use two new vaccine technologies (mRNA vaccines adenoviral vector vaccines) create vaccines efficacy higher anybody dared hope for. well development several new antiviral drugs. less year.

Scientific progress isn’t stopping now.

We may bumpy years manage living virus, wear masks winter, etc. eventually somebody going come vaccine drug close 100% effective preventing infection people take it.

Once reach point, restrictions need apply antivaxxers (if they’re still getting sick large enough numbers flood hospitals), everyone else gets pre-COVID life back. I’m sure scientific side suggest research booster side effects. said tendentially way lower intensity first two times. Turbo Corona Max HD Remix &amp; Knuckles, variant year edition  might causing less deaths infecting young vaccinated people. feel seen. wish people would stop magical thinking anytime numbers dip slightly. unlikely happen degree you’re describing. think roughly situation flu, decades mutation isn’t remotely deadly.

So far Covid pattern variant outcompetes others becomes dominant.  Keep mind explosion cases variant, Europe whole much densely packed example Distance across state Iowa roughly distance London Paris 😮‍💨 much trust CDC, dear Well ya go then, them. tell instead taking pay cut i'll take raise walk. Biggest raise ever got. Also dont pick extra shifts without bonus anymore. Still better cheaper traveler.

Management trying bully bluff way thru fall it. zero leverage soon work floor fold. guy got hospital court unrelated stuff recently.

He sovereign citizen defended told politians also affected sensationalist headlines. dont data have. FLYING fuck, nice take test airports. It’s called day 2 test, take day 0 Moderna making 50 million doses month worldwide. Even switched production tomorrow someone would get old doses still have, would lucky so. Good going share psychologist. tough time sure, reaching people really important. suffer alone. Take care wonder long take this? would guess everyone frantically trying retroactive examination. That's thinking too! Fingers crossed! ability understand written text surprisingly limited provocation.

Mask mandate worldwide impede new variant spread using high transmissible tendency. That’s save whole world lockdowns, stopping economy rush new vaccines research.

Next time ask people elaborate opinion instead provoke disagreement feelings. Covid huge range side effects death. Plenty life altering though.  Seems like problem variant breaks vaccines. Keep mind even true median age (per Google) 27.6 South Africa. population may representative populations may thinking of. March 2020 amazing buy opportunity. I’ll trust experts thanks. said need data determine efficacy vaccines omicron LYR OMICRON PERSIAI 8! Denmark almost 80% total population vaccinated yet 10x exponential growth 6 weeks, even every single remaining eligble person got vaccinated really change much. teacher anyone says schools perfect masks LYING. Whether significant amount constantly uncover nose, lower chin, etc, significant amount follow guidelines going spend class every class saying ""raise mask back up"" 1000 times rather teaching.

Also, may wear state employee shots, including booster, expiration date long wear damn thing. 

For one, Covid permanently going away another put passed leaders mandate indefinite masks indoors simply due reduction things like cold/flu.

Eventually taking ****ing thing going back on. Sports going happen, volunteers going stop tested, athletes going stop tested weekly, etc.

Anyone says impact breathing never coached ran one on. miserable hell. NOTHING positive it. Luckily sport outdoors required play, recommended. guess what, recommend anyone. voluntarily, choice. Thats permanent though it? good news doesn’t evade immunity, fails replicate highly vaccinated places…  think concerning someone sub correcting someone works acute medicine clinical terms. I'm risk group since I'm healthy 24 year old pre existing conditions, it'd parents gotten boosters already. would say variant?

The viral load must high airborne gets nasal area within hours you’ll test positive 

Scary thought problem one it'll late fight react.

It's weighing risk. risk inconveniencing travelers add risk getting control quickly.

So makes sense go hard know safe. way around. Worst ever *so far* I’m age it’s even really covid, former world absolutely magical - it’s ruined social media, reality literally hope climate change, plastic everywhere, way people date relationships changed worse, human connection general, commercialism, affordability. could go it’s gone shit, covid icing cake. first two shots made extremely sick two days each, first vaccine bad enough highly considering getting second, restrictions mandates damned. would rather get extra boosters need. craziest part looked long find fomite direct contact connection. looked CCTV see was, fact, airborne transmission. truly emergency, they'd divert them. Getting downvoted spitting facts, ouch. Interesting must changed since there, time masked Strip shots made ill would worried covid commission couple days. said random internet stranger best positioned decide best you. Ok, might getting TMI territory, legit question. moved Italy US August, bidet bathroom. love thing, still wipe using it.

For reference [this sort there's way aim stream butthole hands-free cleaning. would hold booster now? think might planes air currently? Selfishness. know people leave netherlands can't eat things, go country less strict measures. 

Honestly stop non-essential travel right now. it’s airborne hangs around air like passive smoke mist it’s likely infected plane ✈️ 

It must air plane, like fog snowlike people breathing That's total guess part booster help.

We know bad variant another supersede it.

Get whatever protection say. first two shots made extremely sick took two days, hence hesitation towards getting booster strain specific booster later. demonstrably better wider protection immunity conferred vaccination. 

Not according [the we’ve gone pretty far topic. reaction Omi? planned before? Anyone else feel sorta relieved see regular ol' Delta headline? Omicron sent us frenzy. missed Beta South Africa know life hard now, give up. get this.  We’ll know verdict bad good data transmission data vaccines. wouldn’t imagine 10% testing positive taking test 24hr previously common though Looking ahead… Pi variant comes out, get slice apple chocolate get Pi booster? Portugal, too. know someone went reason. selfish. get booster get new one ever released? booster might still help nu, enough data, def help delta ""traditional"" strains. nothing lose baring slight prick. 100 day thing theoretical time manufacture it. would still need FDA approval. Meanwhile, news handful cases Omicron change fact fall-winter spike good old Delta. new Pfizer one could possibly used prophylactically, hasn’t tested roll yet, theoretically could effective prophylactic.   must horrible. whole family, except one peripheral person, sane this. Sensible decisions taken. worry don’t worry someone suffer unnecessarily. worry people’s insane decisions impact obliged work them. Lol I'm 48 teen plays, thought free game? missing joke?  Nobody wears mask US, protocol enforcements

The U.S. quite diverse. Think like Europe state different countries (or countries South America). area (CA bay area), everyone wears masks, strict covid protocols, 90% eligible population vaccinated, case rate per capita lower compared Chile.

Georgia one anti-mask/vaccine states country. that's experiencing, representative entire country. would like someone going Brazil saying one cares covid South America. they] received knowledge, third passengers still refuse wear masks

This beginning seem like suicidal behaviour unvaxxed anti-maskers point. Well, fair, ""greatest generation"" raised boomers. gonna get booster tomorrow I'm reading Moderna gonna put Omicron specific booster within 100 days, I'm thinking holding it. would good news version? bad news would variant infectious less deadly meaning we're step closer COVID endemic waves variants every year. apocalyptic news would deadly evades current vaccines. even worse band together. start invading random countries kill innocent people. That’s really good point man test one last SA flights UK. let go home. bus full passengers flights. nothingburger. I'm putting money stocks markets reacting potential downside Omnicorn compared Delta. Main issue effective vaccine wise know 2 weeks. market hates uncertainty. One might imagine, though, time new variants become worrying enough justify Greek designation, worrying precisely one-upped existing countermeasures. omega variant would definition concerning us evades whatever defenses erected vs delta/omicron/etc. Thus believe Omega (or later letter) likely worse.  It’s absolutely crazy media pushing this. saw comments researchers may “become infectious Ebola”. It’s completely irresponsible. get it, need careful etc, end world fear mongering way overdone. irrelevant, going happen anyway. see many contradicting messages SA, downplaying Omicron telling us mostly mild cases articles mostly bad news.. Waiting line vaccination bus booster injection Okay I'm confused this: hospitalisations new variant? so, fit scientists doctors indicating majority new cases mild? article mentioned rapid tests suggests antigen based ones experience suggests accepted recognised test stations (at least flew). accreditation local though may different standards EU South Africa. mutations isn’t necessarily bad. emerging evidence Japan’s COVID wave fizzled virus mutated much: past 2 years especially last days, people forgetting amazing adaptable healthy human immune system is, even without vaccine. people vaccinated probably _that_ much worry personal level. never said ban xenophobic. said Trump xenophobic, true. Keep reaching  Fuck. mean also mutate animals something else come back vengeance? Reallocation staff. Surgeons doctors.  people mentioned governments moving faster variants?

People using line reasoning since forst outbreak Wuhan. “The governments thing, *what know they’re telling us???*

We’re living movie people, reality doesn’t foreshadowing big act three plot twist. Sometimes things happen. [In Netherlands, entry requirements passengers outside EU negative NAAT (PCR) test result based sample collected 24 hours departure foreign country, negative NAAT (PCR)test result based sample collected 48 hours departure foreign country AND a negative antigen test result based sample collected 24 hours departure.

So, take relatively inaccurate rapid antigen test also accurate PCR test.

If ignored possibility fraudulent tests (which clearly possibility), 61 passengers must've contracted virus within 48–X hours since PCR test. may already contracted previously detectable yet.

This means can't come concussion yet passengers' apparent asymptomaticnes, since severe symptoms would still take days develop. 10% infection rate within 48 hours also suggests extremely high number positive cases South Africa extremely high R0.

Considering antigen tests accuracy around 50%, also assume passengers went 48-hour PCR test + 24-hour antigen test route, large number empty seats (up 60) plane. I'm sure whether KLM far commented many passengers cancel flight advance, due positive test. I'm sorry what's going life. Hope rediscover strength carry on. hope seeing therapist? Atleast part helps going on. Fucking same. think it’s early tell whether variant less virulent. haven’t seen information age health tested positive. could infected recently symptoms developed. could also vaccination immunity prior infection protective. bribed There’s already Epsilon, others. never variants concern, merely variants interest. couldn’t hold candle Delta never really much. People made part personality. get use hammer beat people disagree politically also pretending they’re main character personal marvel movie. Threatening take away going cause pushback. did. We've known omicron ~5 days, take two weeks see symptoms infection. almost half spike mutations never seen before. I'm glad handful positive cases seem mild, early know variant perform. Whether Omicron different incubation period previous lineages complete unknown. incubation period shorter, instance, transmission advantage we're seeing rate spread actually gets cut dramatically. became positive flight? That’s bad. likely helping anyone I'm arguing, weighted moderate downside. Even anyone situation catch point would likely mild spread much all. Waning efficacy /= useless. fentanyl dealers drug users overdosing dying historic rates? 853? stacked like sardines? Yes, alphabetical order Greek language English alphabet. Here's wiki [Greek letter 'J'. modern Greek English letter 'H' represented apostrope (') first letter word second letter vowel. placed either vowel lower case vowel. upper case Greek letter looks like English 'H' eta (Η η) pronounced somewhat like 'i' 'machine'. 

Greek letters representing series items quite common various fields scienific writing. field labelling really 'goes town' astronomy. constellation may contain many stars common name. Here, instance, [list stars constellation Note astronomers ran Greek letters use Arabic (common) numbers. reasonable take doesn’t involve kind scaremongering. It’s rational assessment events last couple years demonstrates clear understanding human behavior. 

So course warrants ban. expect things changed permanently. won’t necessarily know get sort stable state. one thinks fact 10% people positive good news. must seriously mild infection sit flight. Same. People done while. Thanks that. looks like happened: Officials said Friday evening expected around 85 people would prove positive, initial tests suggested 13% infection rate, told news agency ANP later actual total 61 would accurate. imagine US testing everyone plane? true covid lot less developed younger population countries. 10+ year average age difference western countries makes exponentially impacted. you’re vaccinated take precautions, fine. Stop worrying others. It’s bad mental health.  one help anyone themselves... Like true, rough. No. not. end year profit taking spurned catalyst. Markets overreacting great time buy. glad still mask mandate public indoor places. easy act, mandate keeps lazy jerks skipping out, accounting chin diapers. Really? Gosh. That's weird. Plot twist: 1 kid German Health Minister Jens Spahn said days ago: ""Probably end winter, pretty much everyone Germany vaccinated, recovered died."" 10% positive two flights South Africa, assume variant already every country earth. 

I guess sequencing show us within couple weeks. Delta 1-2% deadly, hospital facilities, oxygen tanks. Take away overwhelming hospitals might get 5% deadly. 

Or roughly 17 million Americans dead year. would cause hundred year depression. Final dose Pfizer? second booster? another one year after? may well require support immune systems long time come. I'm not, calculated decision. Waiting couple months everybody said situation already moderately protected fine. one needlessly suffer appeal sense communal risk aversion despite factors play. annoying see lot comments thread blaming demonizing US, despite strain found South Africa Europe. 

This US problem, problem caused entire world. 

Yeah I'd rather sat house pretty much every day last 2 years working living home social life fun activities planned elsewhere, hell lot better putting others risk. Wish everyone else felt same. Holy fuck was!

How time flies! Generally citizen returning country, need vaccinated. Like unvaccinated woman flew Egypt Belgium new variant.  less likely experience serious symptoms

This good them, also makes much deadly carriers. sounds like movie title: 
Goodnight Mr. Omicron “We’re seeing marked change demographic profile patients COVID-19,” Rudo Mathivha, head intensive care unit Soweto’s Baragwanath Hospital, told online press “Young people, 20s late 30s, coming moderate severe disease, needing intensive care. 65% vaccinated rest half-vaccinated,” said Mathivha. “I’m worried numbers go up, public health care facilities become looked like cluster infection among university students Pretoria ballooned hundreds new cases thousands, first capital city nearby Johannesburg, South Africa’s largest “It’s huge concern. terribly concerned virus,” Professor Willem Hanekom, director Africa Health Research Institute, told Associated “This variant mostly Gauteng province, Johannesburg area South Africa. we’ve got clues diagnostic tests ... suggest variant already South Africa,” said Hanekom, also co-chair South African COVID Variant Research “The scientific reaction within South Africa need learn much soon possible. know precious little,” said. “For example, know virulent virus is, means bad disease key factor vaccination. new variant appears spreading quickly among unvaccinated. Currently, 40% adult South Africans vaccinated, number much lower among 20 40-year-old age group. stops magnitudes dying Looks like would number options: variant detectable early stage, variant harder detect current tests, test results falsified, multiple people infected flight initial test. work place safety issue, it? Delta first sequenced December, researched months, finally caused surge India late March. one point Delta cases increasing India 50% per week, incredibly fast rate rarely seen since start pandemic. Alpha cases remained roughly low constant time.

Omicron first sequenced Tuesday, researched Wednesday, causing measurable surge South Africa Thursday. Omicron cases appear increasing South Africa vicinity 3-to-6 fold per week, though lasted 1-2 weeks. Delta cases remained roughly low constant time.

These comparable scenarios. Either South Africa numbers wrong Omicron going spread *incredibly* quickly.

Additional speculation immune escape virulence unfounded entirely; aside genomic sequence simply know nothing. absolutely reason panic those, time Omicron could grown absolute prevalence several many orders magnitude. thing we'll probably find first (hopefully tomorrow) drop neutralization titers vaccination previous infection. third last week lie. Booster effective stop trying pretend otherwise.  Could industries preforming better compared delta came scene?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Michigan lot severe short term side effects. Everyone reacts different. 10? Well rate going, we're looking 3 COVID shots year beat total amount 3 years so.  said, get vaccinated. Better get get it.

Vaccinated + regular testing treatement soon get positive result.

thst enough drop death neglible number.

but would say regular testing seem critical due long asymptomatic phase:( sequenced it, going test antibodies work lab. think test specifically days maybe could take little longer. Possibilities:

* already infected prior boarding flight. would mean rapid test catch well, significant percentage tests faked.

* infection became detectable flight. Unlikely 10% passengers undetected boarding, detectable levels arrival. true, much higher percentage passengers detectable levels soon.

* became infected plane. know, incubation time covid detectable much longer 12 hours.

Regarding chance ending flight, may unfortunate selection bias people even tiny hint symptoms may want get home soon possible. I'd interested hearing percentage passengers could make flight due testing positive. know feeling watch movie character casually enters building without putting mask suddenly makes feel uncomfortable.

Btw due fourth shot get it. 5x infections would make infectious measles, lot.

Which I'm 99% certain be. keep wanting call OmniCron don’t know documentary talking about, took much effort time eradicate it, first vaccine developed mid 1700s literally started sketching Transformer. Obviously Decepticon lot scientists kinda rail lockdowns, say don’t work, pandemic kinda illustrated two different scenarios. Island nations PRC effectively pursued zero tolerance approach largely worked. think might need change broader message, they’re worried poors even broach subject. Stop Probably every six months booster, ignorant everyone else would guess EU citizens vaccinated, rapid antigen tests known way less sensitive viral load small. They're accurate used precautionary single time, symptomatic testing regular tests.

Anecdotally, 5 vaccinated people know mild covid one positive rapid antigen tests made home contacting authorities, one almost contact since first test 6 made positive. Passengers travelling Cape Town Manchester via Amsterdam 

That's good. know 10% people plane covid, still allowing fly countries? assumption everyone aircraft new variant, unless proven otherwise - isolation. know Omicron Delta yet. ""Expert goes fearmonger narrative, thus downplaying"" shows ineffective travel bans tbh. Go nothing IMO. Yes, react way reacted previous variants original strain SARS-CoV-2: always late people said yet enough evidence.

Here Portugal, Alpha hit us pretty badly even big one. Ambulances queuing hospitals unable deliver patients ICUs full. death rate shot highest world. countries experienced spike infections deaths due Alpha Delta could avoided timely action taken. rate reach Omega next year.. I'm pushing him. said be. said considering parents. would get it... fact triple jabbed trying ever help beat virus. Exactly. totally support lockdowns buy people time vaccinate, increase hospital capacity development new vaccines. travel wear mask. follow quarantine procedure testing procedure mandatory. 


Not everyone life sedentary life within borders, cities like person originally responding believes. Ha...mine A4. Can't wait deal another year chucklefucks. That’s mild means clinical terms.

Mild basically means ‘not hospitalized’. still likely bad unvaccinated, similar Delta.

I’m pro-lockdowns, know it’s going happen. it’s late anyway. start mitigation measures again, never really stopped doing. I'm really trying keep mind. every legitimate article I've read, literally like ""yes concerning know anything might resistant."" kind reaction people unanimously decided worse Delta take vaccine resistant. mean, could totally case, sure. information know right people know they're concerned know much rn. think travel bans severe reaction, think that's completely reasonable. idk. honestly fuck else besides stay news wear masks? fucking honestly. point I'm positive alien invasion would met sizeable portion population trying cozy perks/using weapon terrible, bad, good people. Right I’ve impression travel restrictions don’t work stop spread, may help slow it? time find variant identify it, probably late. Even Australia already 1 confirmed case Omicron. waited lockdown ""last resort"", waited long. 

If sense all, we'd locking two weeks right give scientists time need come answers need regarding transmissible omicron level illness capable causing vaccinated. answers questions hope, going world hurt weeks, point truly impossible put cat back bag facing another catastrophic round infections. 

A couple weeks locked nothing compared consequences acting soon enough. tour bus heard couple behind talking drive-thru testing. Guy sniffling entire time. that’s fantastic. 

For record, understood risk tour, good God people. Covid not, stay hell home sniffles. spoke soon woman quoted idiot. airplane well ventilated, much better house doors windows closed, HEPA filtered. Yes here. US family U.K. I’ve tickets booked month. doubt cancel, whole family vaccinated parents got boosters. change may make see less friends/go less stay home family.

Given COVID become/is already endemic never going time without risk think live manage risks/expectations.

The OP blaze calling people dumb without considering circumstances bigger picture. lot people (like us 2) really want travel specifically haven’t reckless held 2 years now.

Agree insurance issue. Potentially get flight refund voucher it’s flexible move flight spring. telling come side world antigen test get full PCR travel inside EU?

This doesn’t feel right. tried using antigen test fly got fat airline. vaccinated, done likely effective thing avoid severe COVID. 

Ensure eating well exercise continue mask limit exposure strangers fine.  control happens control happens you. 

Give weeks data come out.  way see currently detected may never noticed difference upswing new cases.  Untill fully vaccinated people dying infection lot changed us fully vaccinated people.  :)

Hugs Canada. Thank you! got plane? requirement take pcr test 72hrs? I’d go 30 years earlier. Woodstock, going moon, hippies.  Well doubt not, fact Yup massive waves. See, thing either spreads quickly, case causes huge wave, spreads slowly, case winds everywhere without causing massive wave. anyone link variant tracker? saw posted day. loving (most) cooks restaurants wearing masks. get take-out food trucks, peek kitchen see everyone masked up, loyalty life. hope trend continues! home tests Lockdown purpose exactly? lock delta, reason to. Unless data points significantly deadly past variant, lockdowns beyond pointless. mean simply hosts = mutations (although true), meant virus spread mutate one singular host far faster effectively they're unvaccinated. rather 100 minor infections minor mutations 1 severe infection multiple deep infections. South Africa plenty vaccines. demand problem supply.  necessarily. know enough variant infectiousness yet. could read article Yes, delayed spread countries. Obviously prior vaccines delay limited efficacy.

But that's key here, delaying it. 

Christmas literally weeks away. makes sense buy time multigenerational household mixing, boost many people possible learn variant whether vaccines need adapted. words ""selfish entitled"" right? confidently level bold claim 25 million people one broad stroke, well course except yourself? Classy mate. terribly sad. One wonder, though, ""natural"" death one specifically *caused* COVID. discussion autopsy article.

And 


""Several labs indicated one widely used PCR test, one three target genes detected (called gene dropout gene target failure) test therefore used marker variant, pending sequencing confirmation.

Basically, flagged Variant Concern seems allow reinfection (though preliminary evidence cautious think) detected high number cases vs strains. Though second note confusing, can't tell that's saying actually prevalent easier identify specific target gene look affected. didn’t make champ home tests
We PCR antigen tests government testcentres Doubt it. pick home tests ? It’s also seeing someone actively dying, getting make memories alive. It’s memories don’t get second chance at, makes people impactful life, character, etc. worth, I'm boat you. living Europe, seen family Canada since September 2019. bought flights home Christmas couple months ago, new wave virus kicked back up.

If holds constant, still plan go, since able get flights refunded unless travel gets cancelled due virus. Unfortunately travel insurance airlines view ""precautionary"" cancellation legitimate reason cancel flights. That's great link set graphs, make sense vaccinated unvaccinated hospitalizations low last January, covid worst? idiots driving pandemic. Every single positive test.
And test roughly 500.000 people every day population 6 million

We one countries world testing per capita Yeah definitely wear mask future I've got cold need go out. used think people pre-COVID over-cautious weirdos pollution obviously think anymore lmao. Oh absolutely agree - I'm one moment suggesting going lockdown preventative case. highlighting irony far reliable way prevent lockdown is... lockdown. Wow I’m shocked anti-vaxxer also racist can’t even resist putting racism anti-vaxx meme. I'm sure rule everywhere, fully vaccinated fly? People without immunity allowed plane, period. highly confined space share others hours end. Omicron entered chat. wanting go 2+ years without seeing family, especially aging grandparents. Vaccinated. Got light case isolated w/ gf. Going home get booster dose w/ gf Mexico back NY holidays. test leave last time went went got tested landed well seeing anyone elderly. sort symptom, get tested, take temperature regularly. almost totally isolated without family 2 years took huge toll mental health. I've done literally everything right. point, else do? Sounds like people bad case “shellfishness “ probably lot folks WFH tech jobs. Can't imagine people who's livelihood depends world locking would share excitement.

Literally struggled severe anxiety depression health anxiety (formally called hypochondria) since 10, I’ve never experienced levels before. Also ocd. Basically mental health hot mess, sitting refreshing thread googling “vaccines effective new variant” every five minutes even though know data isn’t available won’t while. I’m desperate soul right now. masks, makeup. masks little thing, feeling societal pressure look camera ready every waking minute priceless. get vibe Optimus Prime one save us Omicron? Based current inflation. fed cannot use nuclear cash bombs anymore work? thinking vaxed, pandemic stay, what's difference, we've shown progress slowing spread, travel? like things safer year two ten now. 

I agree. That's mindset. friends kids vacationing lot.  person vid call lab. right hotel / Airbnb 1-3 days prior. Going edm festival night late, I’d pretty much sleep go airport 5 hours ahead. I’m old, need sleep :) England, Wales, Scotland Northern Ireland different restrictions. England least. Seriously! international travellers supposed PCR test getting flight?!

Yes strange person, congratulations It’s contain; it’s slow down….to avoid short sharp spikes risk overloading social services amount brainwashed people mind blowing. no, personal experience sufficient enough think you’re right. likely dominant variant months. Based what? time machine? look historical charts last 100 years prove wrong. Cause people literally reading posted

Week half posted even comprehend well. said reason travel “growing children.”

Yes, call ban parents, spouses, etc suffice zoom call.

They continue acting like moral police comes peoples reasons travel, us don’t luxury lock home wait disappear.

You continue comprehending entire post together a.... single post. understanding viral testing. Please stop spreading misinformation. Nearly 100% cases SA moment new variant. highly likely majority 61 it. Thank you! people see this? many excited prospect lockdowns? swear everyone 19 year old b friends (mostly wealthy DINKs) going thr world. work home, easier ever. understand world governments think important cater wealthy leisure travelers stop thr pandemic. think I'm robot keep things again? I'm mentally exhausted scared even try.. would thought passengers entering Netherlands would required wear masks past year half. hell there?? two infections HK referring asymptomatic.   It’s “omicron” definitely scary sounding name. News media running scare shit you. Yes concerned little, WAAAYY better shape initial COVID outbreaks leaving, infectious enough test yet.

Or got airport Johannesburg shows test really quickly. South Africa example enough vaccines, don´t enough people want sadly - think problem would similar African countries.  UK nearly 30m tests per month too. I've lost grandparents close to, never close father (and know alive). mother still alive, need see people die. grandma died years joined navy. deployed time even try find home. grandpa died home, seeing hospital something needed. lived was, need see life support family decided going wake up. 

I guess I'm strange person. Damn take He’s fearmongering hack clings morsel covid continue 15 minutes Twitter fame sadly lasted almost 2 years. exaggerates, leaves things out, speculates, infers make things sound particularly bad. implies he’s expert real background subjects speaks. Bummed got Transformer variant instead late 1990s hard rock genre. Going listen Limp Bizkit pour Mountain Dew memory. It’s frustrating see level insanity sensationalism take hold people. It’s like excited go forever. Disney World 2 years missed vacations. First collected Omicron specimen November 9 though.  
So /kinda/ 2 weeks preliminary data. again, didn’t say otherwise. said spreads among people south africa literally isn’t true. People visit Miami winter?

New York Seattle would guess. sure. seems complicated might well let professional test  Lol. Overnight results. five day waits weeks now. People would dropping like flies happen. Problem covid worse flu bad people change behavior like would ebola smallpox.

Sooner later see virus deadly two. Yea but, weird how, despite progress made vaccines, masks, spcial distancing, hand sanitizer everywhere rules travel public/private spaces, things would still get bad lot people planes said vaxxed, could compare international travelers. might *caught* variant, there's single ground report dangerous form covid far I'm keeping fingers cross. dire says? guy speaks international broadcast audience Omicron, Reddit “experts” downvote message. Classic. sOuRcE!!?!!?
How ya go outside take observations ya self. Omniman covid variants must bad reading. say **evades** immunity. said **could** evade immunity based current data. trying hard make random scientist say things never did? genome analysis. several mutations associated increased transmissibility immune evasion, far previously discovered variant.

FWIW I'm sure many people assuming variant \*will\* worse. Simply \*good chance\* worse, governments trying proactive case turns true. clear, many people weak immune systems catch COVID apparently survive. sadly linger long time die. good question. Lmao lived nyc happened. couldn’t get toilet paper like week. get friend lived jersey. everyone experiences whole life Reddit.   ""Start timer."" Well, usual trade economy disease then, guess. still mean wealthy people need haul asses world new kind fun. fully vaccinated contracted covid

how sick get? purpose inbound travel restrictions slow ingress variants abroad, subsequently pace become endemic. 

The travel ban working exactly intended, buying time enact contingency measures domestically new strain researched. Memory cells recognize spike protein antibodies. still saw great prevention severe disease Delta. supply-side Jesus types missing dogma: *if God loved would already wealthy would able afford expensive treatments politicians get.* typical there’s info yet anyone fear omicron variations. Typical fear based reporting. Yes, pretty disheartened it. variant easier detect.

The PCR test checks three markers.
For variant, one marker giving positive. PCR result shows difference immediately compared Delta. 

The true (now disappeared) Alpha variant. fact, UK first detected Alpha variant. 

Otherwise fully analyse virusses genome. boosted? not, second shot? kids (2) got COVID weeks ago every adult house (4) fully vaccinated + boosted got without testing positive. Yes, morons living fear. Again, doctor. covid seems mutate pretty easily...like flu. I’m sure would same, caveat depends long ago booster was. it’s 6 months since mRNA booster, you’d probably see benefit. 

J&amp;J one dose two doses wasn’t whole lot better trials, one dose amazing second wasn’t necessary. J&amp;J Moderna Pfizer booster probably fairly equivalent two doses Pfizer Moderna. always bugged public messaging treated one dose J&amp;J equally “fully vaccinated” two doses mRNA vaccines. 

I’m epidemiologist directly researching covid, PhD molecular biology wrote dissertation evolving antibody evasion viruses. I’m aware - there’s balance stricken. 6 feet keep relatively safe majority situations. Plus, it’s many people sneezing directly - people cover nose hands elbow significantly reducing spread. Yes! Another excuse yell complete strangers feel meaning poor excuse life! left house 2 years! Look virtuous am!


Anyway, back feeding 40 cats! Yes averaging 2 surges per season want count “seasonal”  Rip. Thank clarification. believe covid surging means vaccines work. get them?

Its idiotic groups. proves doesnt work mandatory.

I agree clarification. ... aaand Omicron People clever likely daily regular friend Omicron letter Greek alphabet. So, omi, O. one place US ""lockdown"". very, light restrictions. New York place stricter rules seconded Los Angeles obvious reasons. Everyone always calls lockdown literally changed nothing. week everything calmed down, that, people back normal masked. 


Restaurants suffer yes, thats part business. small businesses enough cash payroll 1 month advance thats another Achilles heel small business. English never really made mind letter ""x"", get weird things like name ""Xerxes"" pronounced English ""Zerkseez"". Note letter ""x"" gets two different pronunciations word! That's true pronounced like ""Kser-ksees"".

Similarly, assume Greeks would pronounce word alluding something like ""kseelophon"". develop common cold covid symptoms degree important get PCR test, even vaccinated. contact positive person, tracing app goes red, also get test.

If currently infected PCR test show positive. detect low virus loads testing procedure multiply genetic sample many times, present. got infected, short time ago virus hasnt sufficiently replicated test result negative, vaccinated not.

Its spectrum on/off switch. certain treshold virus particles needed infect you, infections value quite close actually 1 virus, covid around 1000 iirc. make mistake, tiny amount quickly catch, specially indoors. 

It also depends strong immune reaction mucosa is. weeks shot local immune system strong matter months drop off, still protected severe disease, might actually never develop symptoms, specially delta viral load upper respiratory tract incredibly high, 1000 times higher previous mutations. Hence easily infect others. viral load similar high vaccinated drops quicker less likely get infected first place. shitty probability game really.  came mind announced name.  NEW TITLE: **Clickbaity news agency 'Times Israel' downplays** S. African expert Virologist **Barry Schoub** government adviser, **who says data far indicates vaccines protect severe illness new COVID variant**. Scientist shouldn’t make statements like without data, saying.

Not EU, SA.  Clearly LRR omicron percie 8 don’t disagree either. prefer cautious approach too, temporary time goal eventually get normal. problem people desire adopted new ‘normal’. I’m with, don’t think Americans either COVID certainly yes world reacts every new variant know much yeah... Really there’s data yet say either way. Best wait see, right now, world real danger. hear young, healthy people getting seriously sick covid outliers makes sensational story. vast, vast majority younger healthy people got covid completely fine, even vaccines. 

The vast majority younger people ventilated died either morbidly obese serious health issues. course I’m saying anyone deserved it, saying facts. probably anyone talk while. Ironically, turns less threat first suspected, seen ""proof"" covid hysteria, rather successful proactive collaboration among health officials. What? Come visit America health care system time places digitalization all, centralization information. least we're at. $$$  Hence “IF vaccine works” want told good things. get from? want people losing minds every time new variant thousands anyone paying attention knows this.  necessarily. won’t known Omicron index case determined. quick detection index case *might* found, guarantee.

There least one report immunocompromised patients COVID 6+ months, samples taken time showing viral evolution, patient died. Right forgot that. probably meaning 3 doses combo. Typically infectious virus is, less lethal is. Typically. Yeah, shock it’s number. We’re also going see places saying “it’s detected yet” realizing it’s weeks already, story beginning… needs data? throw words like “dire” headline call day. know vaccines work degree yet. Loll exact thought. found HOPING variant bad say. feel terrible deep can't help. travel bans useless, eliminated flu type b. Travel bans work curb things like this. 


The reason SA probably origin Africa largely ignored rest world comes vaccines. South Africa populated. Blah blah blah point US also abysmal vaccine uptake relative capacity. US also made plenty shit decisions. continue plug India, let’s forget Delta mutation appears emerged India Modi thought would good idea hold massive political rallies…

This isn’t failing South Africa. AFAIK, don’t even know Omicron developed SA, caught better surveillance. We’re going get blaming others walling world. phone could explode hand

*Samsung Galaxy Note 7 entered chat* getting information vaccination status infected persons. Health officials opportunistic...and shame them. Always been. fool One Nation claiming Twitter millions marching Launceston?

Interesting, considering fewer million people whole state. must counting hairs, teeth, fingers toes people. PFE calls moon 🚀🚀🚀 certainly consumed life recently. Yep, travel bans useless point. It’s pretty much guaranteed never find variant early enough travel bans anything even did, would probably enough teeth. Prob need another 14 days stop spread. good. New variants pop up

Article titles “wE kNoW ALmoSt NotHIng iT¡¿!” Also 2 weeks average time desease needs progress point patient either needs go hospital getting better. everybody confirmed positive monitored time. much better picture situation two weeks. God hope remains true. vaccine works omicron, don’t lockdown. Let natural selection thing stop holding following regulations hostage first data shows new mutation less severe delta. would afraid delta? sounds moronic 🤷‍♂️  remember early vaccines thing, one possibility ""the end"" covid. Dominant variant less deadly transmitted. No, it’s 100% person test positive. Zero restrictions England.

They've brought back masks mandate shops public transport. educational establishments places work 100 employees?

No social distancing work home possible.

Once again, UK government proving inept useless. point living life vaccinated+boosted. whole ""Omicron"" doomsday variant shown media going run wild stories next years. Irrespective whether variant vaccine resistant sensationalism downright Hysterical.  positive PCR test 11/16 said ""final result - abnormal,"" mean anything? It’s around long monoclonal antibodies yet conservatives quick jump monoclonal antibody treatment vaccines. (Both treatments work produce antibodies immune system). idiocy never ceases.     won’t. that’s true, really would flu (at point) realistic end game. may good, may bad, may status quo. Either way we’ll know month based cfr. New York California Australian way life, entitled selfish usual Hopefully not. I'm judging travel work. That's travel choosing do, rather necessity.

I'm judging people like kindergarten teacher know went vacation Mexico weeks ago state literally worst country COVID. Got back day later classroom again... There's reason vector virus go beach somewhere. There's literally data base claim on. DoSe KeEpp  science points this. new virus 30 mutations spike protein, specifically what’s causing High dose daily vitamine d, among vitamine k2 seems work according research happen enough cases pop countries? Since taken measures order study variant, natural governments demand lockdown ? I’m someone contraindicated oxygen/ventilator ECMO super likely get sick. talk time people know I’m could face. fellow cancer survivor friend die February 2020 ECMO (not Covid related, cancer destroyed lungs again) I’m way familiar could face. tried requesting masking brother-in-law’s funeral (following Covid death) rolled eyes me. burn rage them. refuse look ECMO prefer think I’m dramatic Covid rather acknowledge deadly AF someone healthy like brother disabled body? They’d prefer dead acknowledge it.    good news, though, happening no-one noticed anything vs. normal Covid cases, new variant may much transmissible Delta all. 

What read morning - apologize, remember where, would mainstream source, regular COVID tests test two characteristics, one spike protein. omicron trigger positive spike protein reading, figured test characteristic. 

Given this, entirely possible people getting sick, getting COVID test, told they're negative fact they're positive omicron. 

It true, many pointed out, enough information yet draw firm conclusions either way serious serious may be, every new development I've read past 36-48 hours makes concerned. basically feel like back January 2020 read novel coronavirus could transmitted asymptomatic. missing piece omicron, far tell, serious illness tends cause.   Thank Right tests people planes looks like 10% SA could infected Omicron already. that's case, even best case scenario lots people going show symptoms.  least government something. country, nobody really gives shit virus, every measure taken half-assed ineffective.  I'd imagine next letter Greek Alphabet Biden probably skip too. 🤷🏻‍♂️   Get bidet ;) Ok many ppl positive. still wear masks? I’m AZ. Last weekend Scottsdale, maybe 5 ppl masks crowded shopping center. 60% vaxxed here. It’s bonkers. EMTALA says seen, admitted. obligated attempt transfer medically necessary, that’s it. It’s ER. don’t disclose admission criteria. docs try admit, that’s usually bed board supervisor decision assign beds. I’ve seen Covid cases sit ER days getting bumped cases, wasn’t Covid room available. *might* explain 10% Dutch flight escaped detection via rapid tests flying exact DGAF approach travel UK employed throughout pandemic. COVID much problem. can’t escape virus. 

Governments around world thought could, transferred onus “stopping” COVID “returning normal” citizens. unsustainable approach beginning divided countries massively. 

Had COVID approached rationally (in countries) beginning, we’d different spot. many reason. work rather international field us live continent away families work obligations need go to. even us travel restricted minimum. yah many unavoidables. state US first one detect it? Got imagine new strain everywhere.  Africa asked Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ.N) Pfizer (PFE.N) delay delivery COVID-19 vaccines much stock, health ministry officials said, vaccine hesitancy slows inoculation campaign.'

In general, feel that, without compulsory inoculation, seeing high vaccination uptake African countries always pipe dream Probably fact there's dramatic shift case rates hospitalizations one reason freak out. problem is, new strain heavily mutated think there’s decent chance could evade vaccines. preliminary reports show could transmissible Delta. That’s everyone immediately putting travel restrictions, etc. Obviously can’t stop completely, need slow hospitals don’t get overwhelmed get new vaccines production. 600 people one flight? type plane that? So, opposite blockchain. Lol think, sent funny meme, might smile today? know of. tests cost like $150 certain testing sites accepted We're screwed mean make difference people avoided contact potentially infected passengers.  Thats popcorn brained imbecile believe so. seems like number changing quickly Source please ? definition long Covid take long time develop

There’s cases long Covid vaccinated it’s worth worrying varies, be. things know permanent regardless pathology. I'm sorry losses. horrible virus took people love life, too. things mind well. would argue flight ban makes sense all. Omicron already Belgium, Israel Hong Kong banning flights Malawi Botswana absolutely good horse already barn. It’s already gone global. Best thing hope vaccines hold line. share nobody act upon it. Share nobody allowed act upon it. What's difference then? RemindMe! 2 weeks strain everywhere soon. Hopefully vaccine holds up. hindsight, sitting doctor’s office waiting room without mask, especially flu season? Honestly insane matter variant. context comment responded. see ""thousands people"" still make miniscule fraction 27+% population vaccinated per claimed stats.

Nowhere vaccination rate challenged - thing challenged relevance statistic.

it matter 5% population two cities unvaccinated - thousands morons protesting vaccination still fit set.

in short, calling vaccination rates refutation article OP exercise irrelevance. scroll comment section nothing peoples genders mind will. There’s literally choice lol actually infected covid negative takes time viral load build get accurate reading.

So it’s possible infected test + day two arrival start able spread get symptoms vaccinated, practice social distancing possible, wear mask wash hands surroundings travel ? There’s cases new strain uk according news papers flights Switzerland. LOL problem is, new strain heavily mutated think there’s decent chance could evade vaccines. love it, hate it, would rate it? best, best! X2 someone else living Paris. DejaVu need stop. vaccine you? Ok, itemized bill, please try pay die 14 days due stupidity. Thanks. great. saw happened last time new variant, lockdown v3 definitely true. multiple pandemic examples know people exposed infected hurriedly fled plane another location ""didn't want get stuck"" want healthcare country. And? Ive seen data still change facts. Interesting? yes, Bad unvaccinated? Yes , highly contagious? Yes also less deadly make vaccines ineffective. Again, another variation blown proportion media clicks. new strain confirmed uk. three important things know virus: contagious is, much immune escape has, severe is. contagiousness highly suspect really bad news.

For immunity, important understand body two immunity systems, antibodies B/T cells. understanding B/T cells protect death unlikely escaped from. However, many scientists thinking might able escape antibodies like 10x number mutations Delta did. words, total immune escape might happen, partial immune escape likely really bad news.

That leaves severity. point, almost information take us couple weeks. important understand plural anecdote data. Additionally, COVID often takes time ramp becomes life threatening. point, severity could go either way. could get really lucky like cold. could get apocalyptic scenario SARS/MERS get 10-30% mortality rate. point, probably likely we'll get similar mortality Alpha/Delta, really idea.

The real problem even mortality same, already likely know contagiousness immune escape paints grim picture hospitals. went Alpha Delta, pretty rough natural immunity Alpha vaccines helping. lose significant amount immunity simultaneously deal something contagious Delta, good scenario might still look like India Delta wave. Tuesday discovery Friday travel bans without proof? Why? I'm South Africa right hoping get back home. There's LOT people feel need vaccinate. supply problem here. countries covid cases decrease majority population got vaccinated?  
It seems like countries lull cases majority got vaccinated seems like opposite happening S. Korea. course, numbers still low compared America EU still seems weird. Printfriendly worked want get time, ban international domestic travel. get people would elect travel internationally right now. understand travel necessary keep world turning, people dumb?

And rarely leaving core metro area high vaccination rate compared counties around us. Haha We’ve seen reporting PCR pic Om. haven’t seen reporting rapid tests can. could already unreliable strain extra unreliable. what's plan? Let's say someone young, fully health, fully vaccinated Pfizer becomes exposed Covid Monday. eventually end contracting asymptomatic case it.

If get tested Thursday rapid antigen test, likely show positive? likely get false negative? know hate this? I'm Filipino, one strongest lockdowns world. longest lockdown, actually, still going. CANNOT go establishments without fully-vaccinated. recent weeks loosened restrictions set alert level Manila fo (Level 2) prepare economy Christmas.

We're FINALLY starting classes face-to-face businesses open, curfew. FINALLY get open doors step outside, another fucking variant upon us...

This pandemic never end... No, cause roght person comes first hierarchy.   Uhhh airplane holds 600 passengers? need N95 masks situation. Surgical/cloth masks protect others you. works everyone masked. 1. South Africa advanced disease prevention infrastructure they've deal HIV, Ebola, TB outbreaks country's history
2. second point based bad statistics due fact Delta's prevalence SA low compared rest world.
3. Thats mostly due vaccine hesitancy skepticism. Tested negative normal COVID tested negative omicron?  dumbest shit I’ve ever heard 2 flights. delay another wave, yeah delay. No. two different flights too, total 600 passengers two planes. fail see relevance correct vaccination figures reply comment incorrect vaccination figures? I’m confused though. vaccines introduced discussed subtext COVID could out-mutate thé mRNA vaccines. What’s changed ? like thinking. 
^^^there  mask got become optional. opinion oppressive, depressing, allow quality human interaction necessary positive mental health development. I'm bit autistic claustrophobic, worst. I'd rather die covid forced wear one. said that, except wear work go anywhere requires it. fly, care restaurants, concerts, shopping (except food go county require them) people stronger reaction face coverings others. okay burka takes away voice connection others. Yes, seems be. Well, thing headline calls ""experts"", talks predicting unvaccinated people's behaviors.

It's kind implied thing expertise part headline. yet... drug companies cannot lie efficacy. panels scientists part approval process would call bullshit. would trouble getting medicines approved lose untold billions watch stock tank. conspiracy theory makes sense. It’s  mean that’s boosters work; initial dose elicits response NAB production follow doses typically given order promote CD4 T-Cell memory B-Cell responses.  idea don’t believe single source information, especially one backed science. scientific foundation entire world would panicking get point, South Africa would open travel. 

Drug companies also cannot simply “make things up” - limited strict procedures scientific methods get peer reviewed, go testing nearly every government health agency planet. lie something - it’ll get called pretty quickly wall scientific checks balances. Around parts, appointments gone end year. Boosters becoming available plus tighter restrictions unvaccinated caused quite lot interest. know mutations cause vaccine efficacy drop slightly, drop dramatically, chance all. T-cells recognize 70 regions said protein. HIGHLY unlikely completely evades vaccines Red spike proteins *so* 2020. Gotta switch up. Holy cow, source correct 20% south Africans HIV Israel fuck around comes Covid. South Africans wont feel persecuted entire world closes borders literally everyone small clarification: I’m talking “bidets” I’m taking hand spray attachments connected cold water pipe. I’m talking devices integrated toilet seat. western version (pricy ones) adjustable controlled spigot shoots water position rosebud be. think going cancel everything again. Lockdowns really unpopular political Yes old yes can. better sources point assertion incorrect outdated. media effectively anti-vax year point. insane. aren’t back square one. 'asymptomatic' people eventually develop symptoms week so? Honestly probably early tell. It’s possible, Hong Kong cases showed high viral load. highly transmissible people could also well mean highly transmissible cells one person. We’ll see. Maybe we’ll get lucky you’ll correct. People many poor countries would give arm leg saved many over-saturated fools rich countries served vaccine silver platter still refuse. Good hear It’s rape forced it. Please refrain reading bit. I’m saying stay ignorant take care mental health ain't fiction, natural fact Hanukah starts Nov.28th. absolute hero, us plebs useless fight lot labs fucking avengers Check username next time, I'm Silverbrewer Israel joking around !! Good. 43% world population vaccinated, 54% least one dose. Yup . getting screwed mean ‘Xi Variant’ 🤔 enough data make definitive conclusions would answer questions better/worse/whatever.

There reasons concerned:

1.	There wide number mutations, seen before, known suspected increase transmissibility get around prior immunity. 
2.	In region know it’s seen abundance, rapid rise cases. indicates concerns hypothesized point *might* backed real world data. 
3.	Early evidence suggests asymptomatic presymptomatic spread might common

Those three things enough trigger response public health leaders. It’s certainly prudent take matter seriously respond we’re sure variant bad think could be. doesn’t mean we’re 100% anything variant, there’s reason enough take steps slow spread give time learn mitigate problem.

At time, reasons pause cautiously optimistic, least consider possibilities worst-case:

1.	Anecdotes individual cases indicate vaccinated individuals may severe symptoms, symptoms all. *might* lend credence idea vaccines still reasonably effective variant.
2.	The variant spreading rapidly one place know exists large scale (a part South Africa), South Africa different many parts world. low rates vaccination (&lt;30% overall), population skews younger, didn’t see massive wave Delta variant. It’s yet clear new variant remain competitive parts world higher rate people vaccinated and/or delta dominant strain. 
3.	There’s evidence strain worse terms illness death. could presumably change learn more, far it’s looking like make people sick prior strains did. 

On balance, think it’s appropriate concerned make plans behave way keeps community safe, it’s early hit sort panic button. We’re better prepared tackle variant preceding variant, matter “bad” may be. Two three days ago, talked 10 cases SA. Yesterday 77 confirmed cases. Today, dozen countries reporting cases Omicron imported SA travelers. many travelers SA pick virus random, suggests Omicron already widespread SA. anyone wondering sudden change, Israel discovered Omicron cases today bigger concern 2 positives people recent travel history. means Omicron already community spreading. mass amount troops boarders, t80s going Crimea? Traders prepping international sanctions, follow money   Sorry guys but.. main concerne variant vaccines doesnt Work.... main raccondstion take shot vaccine May work? Seriously? stupid nation. Awesome. Remember back January 2020 2 Covid cases totally got control! /s  addition transmissible explained comment, I've read articles theorizing average age people SA younger, seeing increased mortality yet. scientists worried impact populations older average age. restrictions taking effect 29th? know... NOW? really didnt need covid variant Lrrr people Omicron persei 8. Sigh. shit depressed. last two years wasnt freaking enough put level ten depression. course i'll still work office sixty already paranoid germ incubator people want reports governments countries sure.  parents coming back Hawaii soon I'm supposed go plane see next week. wonder long would take things changed US.

I similar feeling right day March 2020 NBA canceled games Tom Hanks got Covid 3 hour window. Things got serious overnight. Ah okay. 

It’s curious wouldn’t also point OP’s study. eager point studies cited. anti vaxxers gonna go woods try make sneeze now. see missed past year half. Getting masks issue since summer 2020. might transmissible, might efficient replicating infected allowing innate response bit time. compliance changing? I've noticed near me, depends shop, even time day. Surely time discernible epidemiological impact  Yes. Bloomfield slammed regular. choose believe this. It’s like whack mole moment, dozen countries hours finding cases thing it’s one person, guarantee it’s many one. guess confused US able weather many waves minimal strict lockdowns compared Europe. don’t great results aren’t much worse…. recent pressure almost unvaccinated south.  Covid February, received monoclonal antibodies. May got vaxxed 2 shots Moderna. Last week got booster, hopefully I’m protected. Would probably good news actually. really isn’t nothing. understand it’s good idea know Omicron wear doesn’t mean lot us tired annoyed even vaccines aren’t enough get back society see people’s faces smiles. Paid leave Covid exposure positive case never coming back. Good luck getting people mild symptoms sign missing two weeks income die anytime, anywhere. 

The question balance risks rewards. Life finite matter careful are. 

Vaccinate, wear mask warranted, go live life. You’re gonna die anyway.  lag weeks behind testing. someone suggesting that? Nah get it. It’s tough. I’m tired. happens long lockdown there’s new even contagious variant year. many years lives willing sacrifice masks forever?   course is. OG COVID-19 US well even name. DON’T COME TOGETHER ‘CAUSE COUNTRIES DON’T ADAPT never said anything lethal is. far really seem be. They're scared cause spreads fast. SPUR..but ya know, spur. Fucking hell, thinking too.  Interesting humans top food chain killing almost large predators virus ultimately demise. Touch grass. family uses fact need boosters reason vaccine “useless.”

What objected to, rightly, 600 people kept crammed together poorly ventilated conditions twelve hours landing plans, news, even food water. Fucking water! even became clear people flight pool testing positive effort spread separate anything, enforcement masking, nothing. representatives either KLM Dutch government sent clarify anything either, first started learning lots people flights testing positive news reports rather anyone bothered tell people yet. handled extremely poorly.

Enough time passed (regrettably) every reason think variant longer even primarily South African problem, country adjacent bearing brunt sloppy response likely stem tide. akin ""Spanish"" Flu deemed flu Spanish origins, seems have, Spain initially openly discussed reported on.

I agree saying anything relative fairness unfairness bit unnecessary distracting observation circumstances, problem we've always faced pandemic ever over- underreact anyway. point ever possible exactly amount necessary respond it, never known is. 

So, probably unfair South Africa barn doors slammed shut like global community horses unquestionably already fled, every feasible alternative would even negligent (much like people flights) roll now. Lord many lockdowns want?

Wow, that's reading comprehension failure side, bad! persuaded buy man’s sky release years ago, I’d careful product reviews

Thanks good chuckle dude! Looking back release NMS clusterfuck amazing. think abundance caution. Prevention better trying put fire raging. Imagine this. 100 people flight Covid. 39 test positive allowed flight first place, 61 test negative get flight. That's sensitivity rate 39%. places still quarantine, including (WA), NZ, Hong Kong, China, Israel.

There's delay bit, somewhat agree.

If incredibly mild, we're really rough ride. Even bad vaccinated, going rough ride.  Two days illness definite illness weighted concrete counter benefit moderate downside. Subjectively smart people often wrong dumb people Agree. terrible! deny point least, I've seen many people mindset ""ok it, least good thing whatever want develop anti bodies soon"".

Definitely good dutch one better. way could drive surge identified even pretty low levels variant monitoring. article big eye opener stuff publish. live town. thesis article true, lazy attempt push popular narrative. Notice there's quotes stakeholders sides argument (like power company)? I'm saying racism exist community, say storm recovery racially based wrong. (It's infrastructure issue, dolts) Well flights still allowed. doubt restricts since variant already anyway, thay probably restrict flight south africa even tho late.

I honestly know dangerous situation get safe come unfortunately.

Stay safe, could say right now. Great... I’m visiting NYC days. Late stage capitalism rules, doesn’t it? Plus, South Africa 40 percent vaccinated really still need worry little. exactly opted kid’s school’s weekly testing. CDC doesn’t recommend vaccinated individuals this. about?

What think achieved articles? People already vaccinated, like us, get nothing them. People nutters, get validation.

 articles tend say things like 'miniscule percentage population highly vaccinated country attends relatively small protests'. say 'thousands gather covid 19 restrictions vaccine mandates, here's pictures make look relatively large, followed videos there's scale'. 

People normal pay attention it, people anti-vaxxers see validation normalisation. 

I'm sorry weirdly obsessed tit tat regarding ""omfg country dumb one"" (I mean US, clearly dumber Australia considering vaccination rates anyway) think kind headline...achieves something, doesn't. encourages silly people think alone silliness, protesting silliness get mass media coverage. Accurate enough Netherlands find 10% infected. Well, luckily I, living New York, got booster yesterday. reason I'm lying bed feeling like hot garbage. 2019 serious flu year. There's plenty people sure covid timeframe tested negative antibodies. think main reason taken hold inteterest beyond variants amount mutation coupled rate increase short amount time. sequencing Omicron beating Delta South Africa staggering pace far beyond anything seen previous variants.

Of course there's also evidence may around lot longer discovery, there's lot unknowns - namely South Africa low vaccination rates, low levels room new variant become dominant countries. [98% 99% Americans dying Getting vaccinated really good societal benefits also significant pointed out.  you

I suggest consult studies masks efficacy maths behind mask effect covid prevention.  normal till 100 years ago, maybe less. part diseases part life. Wearing masks health reasons fairly normal Japan rest Asia long covid. I'm guessing know many people able board due positive tests though. could 100 tests came back positive people able board flight. Well, probably triggered nightmares delta variant absolutely wrecking whole year, want repeat that, guess. usual, feel need preface comment ""I'm bolsonaro"".
With way, dismissed call travel curb anvisa said one implemented. theory news (and would aljazeera care something inconsequential) must make people feel warm fuzzy inside villain figure (which is) narrative. like Europe state different countries (or countries South America).

1. found southern Africa pretty sure infected people along development disease know serious is.
2. Governments shutting doors flights southern Africa
3. Virologists around world sequencing viral tests continually. one V.1.1.529. 528 that? never heard anything. reasons people infected 528 strains develop serious infections.  can’t catch non-existing virus!

/s definitely is, leads situations like this: thought. Likely people falsifying results. look people got tests done. Jesus said I’m scientifically sure experts degree confidence assessing it.

Research fact-based platforms take best decision health.  question well. freaked it? ""Past performance indicative future results""

If think repeat March 2020 table rude surprise. Healthcare denied unvaccinated. However, hospital beds full ventilators taken, hospitals make decisions ration care provide resources highest levels care best chances survival. Vaccinated people less severe cases covid naturally better chances survival unvaccinated patients severe cases covid. unvaccinated simply cancelling reducing chances best outcomes. extremely biased left. good. good luck keeping contained fear mongering think relative though. suddenly change costs here. suspect curve accurate, even case numbers underreported. curve increase, although recent, growing sharpest incline we've seen. Much steeper delta. real change deaths yet though: still waiting see real impact case growth. Well that’s prime. fully vaccinated people SA, around 24%.

That's pretty appalling. evolution variants like exactly many experts argued vaccines prioritised countries low vaxx rates rather boosters. Sadly. unique situation dealt uniquely. It’s easy prevent death/severe outcome people, get god damn shot. meant strict, meant risk mitigating measure like implemented pharmacist. understanding, vaccine induced myocarditis tends transient, occurs less frequently myocarditis caused covid (up 16x covid)

With regards vaccines, risk assessment follows: myocarditis better myocarditis (ie Pfizer preferred Moderna), better even myocarditis (from covid). Basically young, male, received 2nd dose, likely develop vaccine induced myocarditis (likely transient) *much much likely* develop myocarditis covid (which carries higher risk long term effects) Well US (and probably Europe), HIV isn’t big deal anymore bc drugs good keeping virus bay. long HIV patients take meds daily, immune systems don’t get totally fucked, live long full life 80s (as long continue taking HIV meds). 

Of course places like Africa, may access new good HIV meds, I’m even sure quarantining HIV would possible. need medications. netherlands cant even get ventilation schools right. dont assume. Yeah clear (phew). 9 year old pretty rough though (I suppose statistical outlier kids cases). Therapist? That’s good one. person wants hide behind mask.

Seriously though, situation still wear one occasionally work required, giving hour long lecture wearing KN95 really sucks. don’t mind good you. Wear two. isn’t normal, comfortable behavior lot people don’t think dismissive helpful. fact type dismissiveness probably opposite effect. last two years felt like game Plague Inc, building spread hopelessly everywhere cranking lethality max once. dont think it’ll Omicron lethality goes moon it’s probably coming point. extinction event slow motion.

It's quotes, anecdotal experience. doubt chair South African would say thing without somewhat confident. ikr?

It really amazes people come stuff like that. people seem think everyone catches covid dies (do think kind fast-acting airborne AIDS?). really makes wonder get information from.

The even worrying thing comments often get heavily upvoted.

The fatality rate covid around 1%. *Maybe* like 1.5% variants like alpha delta produce bigger viral load. far low shift demographics really significant way. Let take me, I’m ready go. received second dose first week May became eligible booster live. Glad made alright. could also wrong, read vaxxed 6+ months ago gotten boosted yet would put susceptibility waning immunity mean wouldn’t expect everyone get seriously ill, unless it’s morphed something insane people going get mild illness variant.  know really spread is, two weeks Thanksgiving.

Yep. detected suspected multiple countries Europe already US. time new variant detected would shocking already spread multiple countries. probability game think country sequencing positive cases high enough rate early detection. doesn’t. SA health minister saying cases far mild mean it’s milder Delta? entirely different statement. 

You also ignored person you’ve quoted mild cases went say right after: know lot mutations no-one tell us stage means something, going fade away. **We don’t know.**”

That doesn’t fit narrative though, it? end. first run TP happened back March 2020 finally able find online restaurant supply company. Problem was, policy assumed bulk purchasing. wound hundred rolls. buy TP like 20 months. Ironically hoarders forced hoard. Maybe contact tracers able figure out. remember Italian case Mozambique South Africa Botswana, without information variant probably needed time get countries. pretty bad. governments didn’t institute travel ban ended spreading like wildfire would huge criticism. It’s best act quickly information. incredibly scary. Shutting everything know more, case, would wise course action. neo con edition, virus mutates randomly, manipulate masses encourage spread meet short term political goals satisfy special interest rewards. reaction opposite: first two unhappy 3-4 days afterward, booster breeze day grumpiness.

It’s fascinating different peoples’ reactions are.  I’m sure actually accomplish sometimes. It’s great tool people think is. running toward endemic status virus masks may delay infections everyone meet it. lockdowns. need understand end goals here. Vaccinated people already contracted variant. vaccine necessarily need prevent infection effective learned Delta.

South Africa *does* currently best view world regarding Omicron hospitalizations. mutation reducing vaccine effectiveness 70-90% zero seems unlikely. 

Even though South Africa may incentive play severity, acknowledge transparency far, respect medical professional's opinion likely based data well medical expertise. Another great opportunity UK government fail harder EU nation. say might sound crazy maybe people shouldn’t flying around middle pandemic Detected bad. community spread need worry Damn, kinda don’t care establish R0 claim that. variant could well less transmissible Delta, faster current circumstances (pre existing immunity Delta better Omicron, thus unbalance)

So Omicron R(t) could higher Delta's even R0 not.

This say R0 greater, say things established really, delta endemic strain. Omicron evasive become endemic strain. Nobodies catching alpha beta nowadays. Sigh, I’d guess California, ton international travel. ): Bet it’s already San Diego. I’m England 42 hours? I'm implying anything. I'm stating Florida backdates numbers proven. read above, yes absolutely isolating.

My question *longer-term* future, premised assumptions:

(1) COVID stay, going become endemic. ""COVID Zero"" unfortunately option anymore.

(2) people eventually get COVID twice year, much like currently get respiratory infections, even coronaviruses (some cause common cold).

Given two assumptions, seems like two choices are:

(1) Continue current policies forever, average person expected isolate quarantine 10 days time, twice year, forever.

Or:

(2) Eventually recognize that, nearly everyone immunity (most vaccination, including periodic boosters; rest inevitable exposure), COVID manifest mild-to-moderate symptoms, rest, treatments gradually get better (including new Pfizer pill). environment, perhaps masking alone could sufficient minimizing spread. absolutely, tell time door never shut. brother's son similar age terrific student reached 16 want go school more. quit. commerical cookery course. finished realised want rest life. went back school, bachelors MBA went management IT.

FL 2 peaks covid mid summer rather hell outside. doubt Apparently also structural engineer inside knowledge airports ventilation system. think Delta airlines suffering due variant. I'm sure Omicron businesses also ok. take pass ordering Rocky Road covid See…this seems like problem. allow US citizens back US, one undoubtedly going bring back variant. Especially longer average incubation time (that’s impression got reading first couple cases) aren’t quarantined. 

I’m suggesting citizens stuck elsewhere unable get home, just…it seems like (in America) serious keeping variant out, need figure way make sure citizens aren’t infected spreading they’re home. maybe there’s plan that? Like robust plan, testing people they’re back US calling good one test land negative.

I also think it’s already here, seems like it’s already everywhere else. may moot unless figure stick plan contact tracing isolating. far hasn’t gone well. Covid positive samples tested case positive, checked variant. Two week estimate, probably slightly less. essentially saying yes, going continue isolation procedures positive tests forever, COVID becomes endemic?

Yes? thing get flu strep, going work around people actively sick, I'm confused. They’ve low weeks now. sure trying imply. Straight CDC’s website mask thing nothing really inconvenience all. idea people get worked it.

Because us, something, extremely ""inconvenient"" (to say least). 

Your experience point view one. 

While new variant may indeed justify use masks (and never went away), different issue whether big deal. many us, absolutely are. Omicron much worse Delta everyone exaggerating? country hurt much economically past two years Americans that, especially 50 states independent control federal government. Yep, country polarization problem anymore...we're long passed that. radicalization problem. SA one best infectious disease infrastructure world leading experts AIDS TB epidemics deal with. fact detected sequenced originating here.

We treated like pariahs rest world honest quick let everyone else know variant happen variants undoubtably wild countries refused acknowledge it.

This second time treated way quite honestly detect another variant could bet top dollar wouldnt peep coming it. trade-off hypothesis states virulence unavoidable consequence parasite transmission; however, since 1990s, hypothesis increasingly challenged.

You suggesting shouldn’t isolate test positive virus kills people selfishly can’t handle 10 days quarantine. absolutely ridiculous statement. Seems like sort data indicated vaccines 40% effective preventing transmission last week. came great surprise me, I'd citing household contact tracing studies vaccination 66-78% effective preventing transmission.

Enough studies like this, may conclude vaccination Covid offer sterilizing immunity, provide mucosal immunity. 

My hypothesis either vaccination prior infection generate many antibodies nasopharyngeal mucus. Covid infection disease two phases: nasopharyngeal infection, mostly asymptomatic, infectivity greatest; (especially elderly metabolic disease), lung gastrointestinal involvement severe disease. Vaccination prior infection offer pretty good protection later, severe disease phase, limited protection first upper respiratory tract phase. 

Those us care may wearing good quality respirators long time. Sorry Christmas recipients, getting KN95s stockings year, too. must wary making comparisons COVID Influenza, Ebola, whatever.

They different viruses. act differing fashions. COVID actually quite novel nature almost vascular disease - trying draw assumptions unrelated viruses isn’t really going accurate.   I’m hoping HIV positive community doesn’t receive backlash. 😴😴😴😴 Actually reason think might case. South African doctor treated several patients Omicron said ""the symptoms new variant unusual mild"". 

Early days still... Chronic infection untreated AIDS patient (common Africa) leading viral playground mutations  Schools longer quarantine asymptomatic students FL. Omicron actually threat, things change quickly FL. important conversation start, work looks really shoddy. ""Cases last 7 days"" around arbitrary date flawed metric seasonality progresses certain areas hotspots. also obviously confounding factors (population density especially) could controlled county level (i.e. needs multivariate analysis). 

Despite these, figure 2 seems make *exactly opposite case authors claiming*. 30% vaccination, mean cases unmistakably seem trending downward vaccination rate increases. earth get published? Aha. bad. Needs cowbell. Yikes Except covid came lab. Well, fuck numbers, they’ve always fudged. 

How well 60,000 people dead equal semblance vindication? 

There another surge, Florida see numbers rise again, jackass governors mansion still jackass. Narrator: didn’t. Good thing major holiday Easter was, would probably make situation much, much worse. Lmao thats though

Autobots rollout cripple testing, get fewer cases... …We’re gonna stuck homes forever now, **are we?** get pandemic news “viacasinos”. AFRAID everyone. SCARED. new ""razor blade candy bar"". Government entities save you! accept fact thing evolved pandemic endemic dealt accordingly. Check 2 3 weeks back date numbers Two points. First, many got vaccinated delta variant. surprising think could happen variant.

Second, still remains unclear ""new strategy"" think adopted differs continuing encourage unvaccinated get vaccinated. imagine lot younger people see Delta big treat personal health think worth going way get shot. vaccine-apathetic rather anti-vaccine. Fear potentially new dangerous strange (unknowns scarier known dangers) could give people extra little push get vaccinated.

Also, people who've ""anti-vax"" social circles later started realize wrong want admit Nu excuse get vaccinated without admitting wrong... Oh. Right. sure didn’t think mandate. Well one hour blissful moment believing evidence mass change heart. rather disappointing. November 2024 variant going real doozie hear read article WaPo comment one there. Said there’s idea efficiency front preventing infections _should_ still protect severe cases emphasized getting vaccinated. That's suspected origin variants.

(This post would regardless party) Thanos coming (2018). Omicron coming (2021/2022). Thanks!  south African variant 6 months ago? Japan reach 70% vaccination rate nearly wipe out, eventually (because that's long time eradicate disease via vaccination) 100% vaccination, likely eliminated like smallpox

there thinking acted aggressively eradicate virus, attempt survive, mutated existence.

[But recently, looks like aggressive combination measures really served severely curb would make sense

disasters never one thing going wrong - always almost combination issues converging creates disaster

so multi-faceted combination efforts key success?

Correct. However, mutation increases infect ivory reduces lethality better chance passed propagated, making likely scenario. sure would claim incredibly odd specific expertise.   virus takes what, like week people start manifesting symptoms?

Whomever sequenced Omicron definitely first person it. Even person could've spreading around week prior discovery, anyone infected, ditto. Everyone's degree separation two away sort air travel somewhere.

I zero doubt already small quantities everywhere--wouldn't even shock penguins antarctica somehow got it. ""But lol"" - Reddit

I mean, might well. Reddit, know exactly 90% comments significantly contagious longer incubation period. severely hinders ability targeted lockdowns (effective) way have. much bad take. 

Firstly, nobody said long initial immunity would last— data good. 

Secondly, anecdata limited set data. look population level, vaccinated populations fare far better even waves. yes, continue spread. vaccines still reduce death morbidity considerably. 

This FUD. doubt could provide source last point? Thanks. Bambi's Revenge! really wasn’t, mistaken. Delta never took hold South Africa like many countries. Pray harder, duh Also could worse. reason either happen SARS2 infect killing. Makes sense thinking. thinking fully vaxxed Pfizer, moderna j&amp;j. that's messing around. Thanks article, OP! Mostly needed. flu vaccines get tested. big difference getting tested running clinical trials. Testing takes couple months. Clinical trials normally take years. “What’s more, median post-booster antibody level three times higher typical another group people whose antibodies measured weeks getting second dose vaccine, they’re close peak. 53 times higher group 76 unvaccinated people recovered COVID-19 two six weeks earlier.”

Plus isn’t association study either, people get real triggered findings. That’s said. said they’ve doesn’t work, also pushes anti-vaxxers farther away.

This article scientist predicting millions get vaccinated due variant. one paid attention pro-COVID antivaxxers would agree true.

public health officials keep repeating ineffective messages get vaccinated low confidence work millions people.

We need new strategy. Jesus Christ 🤦‍♂️ stop living fear Me, loud: ""Oh terrible!""

Me, myself: ""Yesss there's way work make us come back office now."" taking basic precautionary methods “overreacting”? 

I truly understand people like think nothing. That’s silly. town, didn't. false. kind doubt make unvaccinated rush get could definitely see increasing booster intake weren’t really considering before.  People LOVE side-effects bigger dose. better alternative, course. I’m expert shit tho maybe word shouldn’t taken seriously. God hate fucking shit fucking much like 40 deaths. seem amazing.  number convince insane, stupid people. work ""red"" area Michigan, vaccine compliance awesome. much this. overlooked. Antibodies great. Think landmines gates. serve great first line defense know enemy going attack, super effective. enemy dumb, often figure way around first line defense. Luckily us, vaccines also train T-cells kill enemy. T-cells like seal team six immune system. tricked easily, kick high gear good night Mr. Omicron.

Typically single mutation exchanged two lineages. B.1.628 speculated arisen way. It’s 100% hear! don’t deny, die  highly unlikely work *at all*, vaccine resistance likely there's enough data tell much yet. wonder many people world wide dropped whatever else focusing variant now. Word year: Schadenfreude Exactly, much endurance power. It’s 2 years haven’t seen mum.  long-time friend physician (board certified MD) upstate Minnesota (remote, rural area). Early career, often doctor call county. 

A couple weeks ago recommended patient get vaccine. 
The patient irate suggestion that, get vaccine, went home threw blood pressure heart meds stopped taking insulin -- doctor obviously know taking about. Ended ER week later 5x glucose levels. 

We're dealing brain-washed people here. reread comment sure, one sentence said even implied lockdowns needed happen forever.  could mutated greater lethality still displace variants. transmits symptoms, matter symptoms wind being- including death. look ebola. state major city/airport hub probably first, though truth told I'd bet $500 there's already Omicron United States now. 

New York, North Carolina, Georgia come mind. Illinois Minnesota also possible. got since one would hire him.

You hit people livelihood literally thing work them. years ago hackathon, challenge IOT. I'm wondering someone stolen ""smart"" voice activated easy bake knockoff made years ago... Oh absolutely, know every news organization chomping bit post article every single region variant gets detected in. Let's hold horses declaring vaccine works case two vaccinated people (one btw infected quarantine hotel). bound asymptomatic cases unvaccinated - would say proves vaccine unnecessary?

We need wait actual studies drawing conclusions. realize shows vast majority reddit discussion completely useless atm - everyone reaching anecdotes show fucked. Yeah I'll wait pfizer moderna tell us effective are. 

Fingers crossed true though. much Transformers stuff leaking news. call Ed Orgeron virus football coach. Vaccinations end this. open mass vaccinations we're literally never going to. 

People actually _take vaccines_ get there. available win condition.

Unfortunately, we've still got holdouts... are, there’s lot data takes time get through.  know antivax, Omicrode definitely validation stance toilet paper hung roll. also stance Saturday night's alright fighting. anything else already believe. Omnom Ron velidates it. can't imagine US testing everyone face licking convention, let alone airplane. Yes, I'm assuming mandatory quarantine something though? citizens able travel back. (Just acquaintance, I'm contact this.) saw wouldn’t let South Africans disembark plane Amsterdam  got bidet. I'm exaggerating say significantly improved general outlook life. Yes, get antibody test differentiates vaccine natural infection. Antibodies spike protein elicited both, antibodies nucleocapsid natural infection. uh north Bay Area (Chico area). confirm - Alabama meth Alpha named Xi  Toward end article really found wishing countries leaders could blunt. need another booster time develop produce one variant. Queue anti-vax/anti-mask people continuing complain long annoying dealing COVID is. date incorrect; that's page updated today old date left it.

B.1.1.529 first sampled November 11, first sample sequencing finished Monday Tuesday, B.1.1.529 number assigned Tuesday. 2-3% monumental sell off... ultimate issue using vitro labs make huge vivo assumptions. lot immune system directly test labs. get wrong, great tool collect data, end-all issue. even ability know people innately completely impervious Covid regardless age others end septic dead. 

We see does. going take 2-4 weeks know true implications variant. must vigilant stay top every piece data, ultimate truth idea going anything anyone says educated guess best pure speculation. 

🤷 earth 85 people make onto plane covid? tested departure?! many people contagious there's high chance people plane got infected flight (especially sit ground hours awaiting tests - cabin air exchange). tested negative arrival free go roam wherever, ""home quarantine"" enforcement joke. SHTF scenario next  Lmao Might well name Winnie  St. Faucci say can't get together Christmas, wait it.  chuckle fucks going rely upon natural immunity? also skipped Xi, probably Xi Jingping. So, might bit theoretical, gathered:

This actually strength vaccine natural infection. many would say here, vaccine wanes faster natural infection. seems natural infection make body reliant antibody even stops working (and apparently theory people die Covid, bodies stuck using antibody previous cold infection). transience vaccine may help body switch gears easier. long reach Covid Sigma? thing naming viruses. Absolutely useless organization Covid gave physical scar mark deformity cured, people would 100% take seriously. social media, vanity lot people have. I'm truly sorry. confusing 20 months.  Unlikely.  

Omicron mutation part gene typically targeted PCR tests, causing score 2/3 instead expected 3/3 hits.  would noticed investigated happening.   hard time believing taking 5-6 shots good body. 

Are stupid? It’s like engineering. Since salary exempt OT, many employers firing bottom 50% staff demanding left work 80+ hours week. logic make money way, since get output half labor cost. sour &amp; destruction personal lives employees non-factor MBAs running show. asking scientific approach dictates would do, light development.

What asking condescension, got you.

So, unhelpful dick. Cool. Cool. understand Xi skipped, Nu? avoid people getting confused ""new variant"" ""nu vatiant"". Next telling us get Zap Brannigan Definitely. can't current vaccine fully stop vaccinated person transmitting virus others? regards mechanics virus, possible ever vaccine completely stop transmission vaccinated person? covid work way? spot on. people *exact* worry given know it’s mutations :-/ Even vaccine effective, stopping/slowing spread Delta make contact tracing data gathering new variant easier. Plus would real embarrassing died Delta waiting info new threat. That's true every new variant detection, unfortunately. Agreed, hadn’t done it, every COVID-denying RWNJ would take social media blame personally creating distributing new variant. Lol I’ve heard “once kids safe” line years. First 12+, 5+. it’s newborns (have newborns died Covid?) Ridiculous. going keep going backwards It’s easy solution. It’s never gonna happen US unfortunately. generally expecting come automatic weapon fire adopt dispersed formation. Wondering going around Michigan. get lots international flights Detroit. local community Michigan 25% positivity rate. Figured out.
The date (July 12) article mentions B.1.1.529 appears incorrect, actually links Reuters article day ago support.  I'm glad asked. 

We scheduled boosters Thursday. 
Thank you!

My summation answers recieved, I'm resting easier Absolutely. virus care deadly is, anything ""want"" less deadly hosts live spread longer. 

The factor affects spread transmissibility, actions (to much lesser extent). 

Ebola horrifying disease, buy exactly likely epidemic, pandemic. time contagious obvious it, cases physically impossible move far enough infect anyone come bedside unprotected. trump too. Trump covid made media outlets lot $$$…now trump gone covid likely fade everything fear monger  Didn’t Angela claim virus couldn’t mutate much without becoming ineffective? Came post thing. trust Bedford's opinion great deal.

I feel terribly rate (in absolute terms relative Delta) become clearer following days, moment, believe we're looking variant potentially significant immune evasion appears spreading rapidly. 15/16 Americans dont stop testing quickly could heading disaster! biggest problem amateur armchair Canada told 2 weeks lockdown. became 2 years different measures (we still masks things Ontario).

Then told vaccines get us normal. see even highly vaccinated places like Portugal still enact measures. vaccines get us back normal.

So ""feels"" like virus magical apparently nothing works. There's going back normal (pre-2019). media makes worse fear porn. hear real. got booster last month. Would get another 100mg dose? wait X months get 200mg dose? wait create manufacture Omicron-specific vaccine? hard. like every office pops champagne bottle that's celebrating every time there's new variant cause it'll cash cow. 

Things may bit dry since Delta outcompeted everything majority year 🤣 going force wear pants supposed ""rattlesnake"". Even real, like pants going stop rattlesnake anyway. It'll bite hole right pants. deep-state scientists know this, asking us wear pants efficacy anyway, control.

TL:DR: rattlesnake wants ass, going get ass, I'm wearing pants. whats coming… lockdown? Back remote work Realistically, it’ll probably seasonal sickness like flu whatnot. is, get shot Where's frender need him! Yes...exactly stated. big huge if. big huge let's fucking hope so. eagerly await means already got booster. it’s two years need move following 3 vaccines. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Might well nothing. won’t make difference anyway. media might thing worse actual covid. even kidding sake whatever, catch break? seen family, girlfriend friends two years finally booked ticket get Australia travel. things started looking optimistic long, comes out. know react this. I've done basically anything could contribute, got vaccinated, wore mask even required no, enough. know rant know else put what's going mind way. I'm burnt out, tired depressed. really looking forward break spend time loved ones I'm seeing light end tunnel anymore. Thank neighbor 3 houses died covid, would loudly proclaim rest neighbors covid big deal? Simply bc don’t know person 3 doors down?

If something happened street — criminal break-in deadly infectious disease — I’d ignore say it’s “no big deal” simply bc I’m personally acquainted person happened to. neighborhood close enough home ring bell, alas. reporting CNN saying. Doesn’t need significant. need one case take indoors, take home. Everyone converge outdoors go indoors stage. think new African variant? That's it, I'm out!

That's literally shit sample size one. two data collection methods ""sit around wait someone beats face inescapable facts"" 


They deserve get nonsense. even live anymore you’re scared? What’s point? One thing remember, Africa (esp South Africa) operates opposite seasons Northern hemisphere. Spring, may mutation occurred Winter. dare mentioned new variant friend, unvaccinated ridiculous. 20 people Christmas going change. assume taken [their press talked going back 100 micrograms boosters older people.

Of course problem Moderna they're making 5\*10^9 micrograms mRNA month. That's enough 50 million 100 microgram doses, 500 million 10 microgram doses. larger doses comes direct tradeoff. I’m currently recovering moderna booster doozy. far know got regular booster. knows? Could stronger time. Biden one first say Trump travel ban xenophobic? 

Oh turn tables.   Yeah. would shocked it’s already. isn’t, get soon. Oh get haha hopeful well less deadly delta closer OG covid even less deadly would amazing.

I want anyone get excited yet hopes crushed. hoping well. Okay pedantic, ""iterative systems naturally tend towards fittest form outcompete less appropriate forms. virus takes form high transmission low virulence means crowds variants.""

Yeah I'll stick ""virus wants survive reproduce"" lol guys going another lockdown, another new jab perhaps? Thx live near mother sees days daughter school since work early. 

The whole point set quarantine, people see family friends safely possible decide 4 weeks quarantine (2 2 way back) worth it. 

I understand I'm ""normal"" try accommodate many people can, I'm also going lie see things feel. Lots assumptions assessment there. 


South Africa sequencing upon omnicron's arrival tests Delta vs Omnicron show Omnicron outperforming.  


Now, unless saying case delta taking longer sequence. doubt it. case, test, omnicron know right away delta. come Omnicron sudden outperforming much? can't ""easier"".  


I know trying bring calm. humble logical constructs. Oh no


Anyway Yeah. feel like people took seriously getting booster realizing lost protection now. I’ve lost hope concern anti vax people. Maybe Popplers cure!!! know night clubs visited. dancing allowed.  Good question though.  Everyone flights tested beforehand. (Rapid tests, assume) Even vaccinated still catching spreading it. We're hospitalised much dying. husband positive he's fully vaccinated.

Everybody stay locked nothing COVID eradicated.    know Delta transmitted faster previous variants higher viral load.

What's making Omicron transmitting even faster Delta? simply ability evade vaccine natural immunity? also high viral load? asymptomatic spread? necessarily. really dependent strain really started SA. numbers rising within past couple days may cases.

Ummm, airplane hold 600 people? positivity rate general population well 10% though (of undergoing test, roughly half symptoms, half precaution). 10% random sample seems high might 'normal' unfortunately.

What fuck saying? 
As far get vaccinated, ones putting people harms way. don’t understand people like don’t get this. don’t reach certain amount vaccinated people, virus mutate become stronger, therefore eventually rendering current vaccine useless. understand cannot take vaccine, incredibly small number people. I’m tired listening people perfectly healthy say get vaccine. get damn shot, let’s get past thing. knew going get ton shit saying this, fuck it.  ...meh We're still listening fear monger, black people testing, scumbag hey? Right on, love us Yup feel like media cheering virus? Is...nothing else going world? found patient Belgium travelled unrelated county *11 days ago* . likely got locally. case, variant already lot places.

Probably good thing. means variant new means data South Africa probably skewed low Delta prevalence low vaccination numbers I'm going Google this. Hoping new adult film people Lego arrangement. Everything's bigger dumbass texass don’t sequence shit, find know little.  Take good news bad news grain salt.   versions Covid cause mostly mild cases.

We need know lot make true comparisons draw conclusions. side effects got booster sounds like ones first second dose. I'll never get ""booster""...fuck that. I'm ""fully vaccinated"" - long definition holds. matter vaccination status, fully vaccinated people spread virus. point literally nothing except let run course.

Not me, give zero fucks. disease anywhere eventually spread everywhere. point travel bans buy time. Roughly speaking, cases imported South Africa begin spreading rate, every week banned travel South Africa's upward trajectory slow Omicron US 1-week amount.

Once absolute prevalence US gets anywhere near ballpark South Africa completely changes, course travel ban drags on. good point. Things actually looking surprisingly positive today variant. Hope eat words days. They’ve found vaccines similarly effective keeping symptoms down, stopping spread. fast antibody response coupled slow B cell response, remember correctly. mean it’s days, patients wife’s ICU typically mild symptoms day 8 average, shit hits fan. Yeah, accepted COVID going endemic (and definitely is) good ago - well established worldwide population mutation like (essentially) inevitable. People want downers saying much loud. 

I mean, potentially much lethal variant certainly possible, either way, COVID new potentially dangerous variants fact life foreseeable future. currently 0 Johannesburg fully vaccinated hospitalizations.

Well, may take good sign then, right? Yes, know details passengers yet though. live US county simular issue. actually changed end reach 85% vaxed, February, sure belive them.

The thing OK targeted mask mandates, set broad equals masking forever. really want one gym. [Covid's favourite  headache short time nothing else, that'd ok too. Hell’s ape 46% ""herd immunity"" original virus Alpha, absolutely wrong.

How sure that? I'm aware particular number recognised definitive herd immunity threshold, indeed opposite likely, there's thing one magic number depends region specific factors like number social contacts, inter-region travel, etc. Different countries different herd immunity thresholds, virus.

In February 2021 India seen declining case numbers deaths five months. new variant would seen trend change?

Even today total attack rate/vaccination rate Covid India long way short estimated herd immunity threshold Delta, cases fallen significantly quite aggressively eased restrictions.

Or, put another way, practical herd immunity threshold given place almost certainly lower classical equation of: `1 - (1/R0)` heterogeneous network effects. make vaccinated equate declination corona related intensive care. Vaccinated people shouldn’t suffer longer sheer selfishness. Omicron Persi 8 Didn’t tested vaccinated boarding? getting 200-300 cases day past month easy spike percentages closing travel individual countries pointless counterproductive. want keep variant out, need shut *all* travel, which, country like Belgium basically impossible. make difference PCR tests test positive 8 days incubation.  difference can’t change channel… know come on.  Nobody else knows anything don't. know genetic profile, know spread. know research done. That's literally it.

I suspect people going ape Delta traumatised us would finally rather proactive reactive. Well, far what's said even SA authorities, mild cases seen far. I'm saying pay attention could care less, panic worst move could now. Let's hope one give us headache. boring, blocked. Get help, aspie. nothing value contribute here. mean Monday India hell’s ape delta ripped through. run course cases , overall, super low. That’s Omicron ran dominant quickly. thing ""Human Rights"" really exist sense made generally good. certain aspect ""rights"" longer good, lose them. cares whatever link says. It’s doubtfulthis plane would representative entire country. Yeah, makes sense wait two weeks take action. don’t know enough know bad is, can’t give two weeks spread without attempts curb it. turns bad, oh well, restricted travel weeks, turns pretty bad nothing knew that, oops, wasted weeks. brave  *Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn* oooo namecalling; yes right fact look word said used wrong made sure instead digging heels whining must right. 
""the adults trying conversation"" lmao added anything comments UHC zero US’s capacity. anything, (the US) much capacity deal this. Hard tell asymptomatic presymptomatic point. Tired this. I’ve two shots Pfizer, plus booster. point let get Covid takes me, it.  true people going absolutely *ape*?  countries government election commission sets election date, delaying crisis always option. US outlier this.  sounds like pokemon Europe's outdoor Xmas markets? shoulder shoulder packed. I'm pretty sure masks least something situations.  Enjoy 4th shot. mine. primarily media hysteria

Shocked Pikachu face.

This pandemic made despise media much can't even put words. improving situation mean milder symptoms less severe cases avoid overwhelming hospitals. Then, answer yes.   already subscribed Delta+, subscribe one too? ""You're going die here."" we? India hellscape Delta ripped through.  Netherlands require negative test within 48 hours boarding international flight? Echoing something said another comment, good news seems variant least seem *more deadly* significant degree. remains seen whether actually backtracks Delta's effectiveness. Moderna booster half hour. waste wait one projects new variant?  Please bring bad mojo.... Pretty sure that’s Michael Crichton book vaccine seat belt.
Not driving restrictions. mean going around deer reservoir species seems. covid cases extremely mild, so.. Makes wonder Common asymptomatic cases are. There’s also huge college football game Ann Arbor tomorrow… 110,000 stadium alone. Bars packed well. 

Hoping doesn’t lead much strain hospitals Lol. current state discourse apparently ""mild covid"" gives ""permanent injury."" taking account possible anti body dependent enhancement vaccinated?  Technically correct, everyone calls Covid.... money literally that. I’m shorting oil gas bet haven’t seen worst COVID (most travel still oil/gas COVID fears go up, oil goes down) gave receipt dosage listed. hope so, take care name another country achieved herd immunity one wave I'd love hear it. 

It stupid claim time, like says. 

There's million better sources. Medically “mild” means “doesn’t require hospitalization/supplemental oxygen”. 

Not layperson means say “mild”.  I'm sure I've ever seen mild used way even clinical setting. 
This would generally fall moderate experience. 

Mild Illness: Individuals various signs symptoms COVID-19 (e.g., fever, cough, sore throat, malaise, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, loss taste smell) shortness breath, dyspnea, abnormal chest imaging.

This would keeping mild case.  Article 7 says lot things, general comment open doors even larger. gotta take jurisprudence account. 

You really think right refuse vaccine ? body autonomy anymore ? Indonesia received first batch novavax btw.. Joe Rogan, course Don’t listen people saying brings us back March 2020 vaccines useless. know nothing talking about. little data right now.  u/banano_tipbot 1 NOS Dutch national news broadcaster, far NL news go, doesn’t get much larger. well observed ""always buy damn time"" working? Assuming eyes even part way opened. Well, ground hard grasp abstract facts like 1) Delta variant one contagious viruses ever discovered man. 2) new variant outcompeting it, large margin.

Considering facts, we'd better hope less harmful, including older sicker population always susceptible Covid. ""Experts concerned new variant concern, dubbed 'Jesus Christ Crutch!' WHO, ten times transmissible current dominant 'Hooooly Fucking Moses' strain."" would actually good us, right? Getting immunity without much risk. everybody exactly everything government says, maybe we’ll get freedom back didn’t. It’s clear it’s already spread - that’s problem. genomic testing atrocious US. test covid, don’t genomic testing. separate things. people wait it’s tested here, it’ll far late. That’s people need vigilant now. Remember r/AskReddit thread question like ""countries wont ever visit again"" people like ""EGYPT""   made everything dude. 

Nothing exists. head. Yes. Great 5G reception, tho. would logically foolish think new variant disease general instantly spotted chance spread. variants end insanity over? want post covid world asap. good point. statement helpful moment. Quite contrary. didn’t people replying sure did. kind misinformation stop. definitely wanna make clear didn’t say that. I’m sorry unclear. skip Xi variant alphabet. happened one? Everyone panic stop getting click baited. Wait real results come out, article says ""step-virus monster size protein spike defeats petite vaccine shot"" good source information. panic take caution guess. week most, cost? always monetary either. conversation needs happen. can't ban willy nilly little positive effect without talking negative effects has.  Spanish flu ended. less severe dominate strain took slowly turned endemic status manageable level return completely normal life. Go tell 60 million american adults dont even vaccines. Incorrect, there's numerous articles studies showing predominate strain affected US European strain. Somehow inital news patient completely missed important Egypt part story said ""travelled Africa"" technically correct ... argh... didn’t say all. Understandably pre-vaccine world, point still stands. people ground source seem far less concerned people thousands miles away. Sure. Memory hole again. It’ll fiiiiiine Spoiler alert:  Yeah..
 That's mild. That's severe... studies read, Natural immunity last long. No, century monetary policy neglect coming head. would buying dips. would think would follow Spanish flu timeline? completely new virus, importantly new world much higher population 1000x travel. 1ďđD,d,txt c szze,zt NOS pretty big imo. happening Amsterdam, I'm guessing know way around international outlets follow later. Thank asking question saving unwitting omi-cron embarrassment We’re 18 months pandemic. modern medicine pandemics would often last 4-6years recur several bouts. They're talking medical definition mild, indeed different would likely consider mild point it’s haven’t seen them. Get tested go visit, wear masks, social distance prefer, you’re vaccinated it’s fine. cost seeing someone multiple years - especially they’re old likely live much longer, far greater risk vaccinated person spreading covid them. Nah delta monster. Delta. won’t enough. variant already found Europe Israel, likely already spreading airports around world. solution requiring quarantine everyone entering nation, New Zealand Australia proved effective. People panicky creatures, easily fall victim sensationalist headlines I’m sure. Poverty high South Africa. many people flying Europe? Also, uptake vaccines varies among groups overall it’s low SA.

Here’s article remember back January poverty coronavirus South Africa [poverty literally would variant end pandemic... hold strongest variant pacing every variant. got Spanish flu. Highly transmissible less severe.

And I'll play optimist... mutates becomes even LESS severe highly transmissible. We'd looking serious cold only.

Here's hope. Cheers end. variant specific gene deletion picks one PCR tests, countries use test means retroactively examining PCR data estimate variant started becoming significant percentage cases. That's exactly clarifying ""mild case"" mean important Surprised anywhere reported big media yet , alarming interesting information Buckle  Omnicron sounds like Marvel Villain… combination number mutations dominance sample cases SA.

However, would bet ultimately fine people would feel justified initial concern. Well, virulent strains would end pandemic too, lot deceased. gem fishy. seems lot backroom conversations happening amongst governments variant. variant found 3 days ago yet already travel restrictions put place. Something telling guys could real deal again. one makes vaccines useless.

Those officials US connected networked Wall Street.

Make vaccines useless? Really? Even boosters? People losing minds right zero data coming conspiracies. insane. This. Vaccines help ton (especially severe illness, also significantly spread), believe masking reduces transmission even (IIRC, 80% vs 50% reduction spread 90% combined). extra important early days getting covid people yet know it. Apes together strong Obviously. need know first mutations entail terms severity/infection. already incipient viral spread US point, albeit unrecognized. Shutting borders late game would’ve pretty futile gesture. People celebrating seem freak horror variant proves dramatically deadly. That's one win belt. think? Someone work place refuse get vaccine even relative died covid Almost like governments.

Lockdown

Shut businesses

Take medication 

Lockdown again

Take medication again

No gyms. Oh sorry business

Lockdown again.

Oh fuck get booster.

Print money. Inflate prices. Make housing unaffordable. Grab power control. Nice something positive vibes n grim week ..... Wii U variant? terrible awesome idea.  tell us much many mutations could little impact. dislike much agree infected people means dead anyway. None proves variant makes vaccines useless March 2020 lockdowns coming like commenters saying. Saying stuff like insane misinformation get data. asymptomatic even know except results pre-travel testing, I'd say vaccine job pretty well. already knew that.  Transmission occur anywhere close contact 15 minutes longer. large spread cases BC party beach. it’s really theatre. 

What safe outside, socially distanced gatherings - keep 6 feet apart, science says you’ll fine. don’t think you’re completely immune 1 foot away someone coughing storm you’re outside. Delta higher transmissibility, slightly severe clinical course. Vaccines therapeutics still work reasonably well prevent severe health consequences.

For CDC, VOHC significantly reduced vaccine effectiveness (likely efficacy severe disease, rather efficacy transmission), severe disease/hospitalizations, significantly reduced therapeutic effectiveness, failure diagnostic tests.

I think Delta approached thresholds. 

Too early say Omicron. 

Evidence date substantially higher transmission deaths yet attributed. Omicron discovered case tracing viral genome sequencing cluster, gather correctly mostly among university students Tshwane. demographic group usually severe health consequences Covid. likely present general population South Africa, likely number countries regular commerce nation. I'm awaiting South African stats hospitalizations, critical cases, deaths, closely.

But still small possibility Omicron ""common cold"" variant we're hoping for, end pandemic. Easily transmissible, low virulence. Giving everyone resistance severe disease low risk. would sort miraculous, possibility. Herman Cain awards filled people made risk assessment. People underestimate risk. think ""Nu"" greek letter ""Delta"", figured would called. settled Omicron instead, alphabet. I'm guessing ""Nu"" sounds like ""New"". IDK decided Omicron. Maybe different well... virus similar Delta mutates, maybe they'll call ""nu"". vaccination rate delta hit India really low - like 6% something single dose. Also government blundered big time claiming victory virus finally super spreader events like state elections religious gatherings. 

Luckily world significantly vaccinated hopefully limit cases. 

Also commenters - little fucking empathy people perished covid India. Many older people couldn’t get vaccinated even wanted to.   100% take grain salt, prepare remote work remote life, go ahead slow walk readiness plan. Short hang hover rest us await data science lab coat folks need time get right come news good bad means already late anything except, hopefully, work better vaccine. 

I'm starting feel like we're getting glimpse used happen history. sense fatalism creeps in. Omikron variant extremely short incubation period got infected flight. Get job industry profit lockdown (i.e. car sales) makes even easier. Good point, guess people got infected plane.  15 110 known test results 600 passengers. Awaiting results tests passengers. lot mutations known give high levels immune evasion previous forms variant. includes vaccines. 

 also mutations key sites. lots mutations general. pretty good guessing antibody resistancs genome data. transmission advantage non-obvious part.. appears large. fair, erectile dysfunction although embarrassing much less visible paralysis pockmarks. 

You're also assuming could get first place. well need downer  Merck pill data recently updated show 30% efficacy hospitalization death Yeah wish damn virus would kill life also wondered that.

But yeah gueas can't infected variants sane time - IDK why. personally done ""taking measures."" among first vaccinated, followed rules protocols, took large hit personally financially result, I'm DONE held hostage legion idiots consider special same. That's feel Nookie variant  Unless vaccine ineffective it? people worried? [There's entire subreddit tracking beginnings agree. knows effect stacks? one would pay attention. agree. permitted international travel good ill. Let people get lives. People chance vaccinated point. @sailorrooscout good one, tho I'm also interested finding although they're Autobots? Depends US. New Jersey double population Denmark half space. becomes even packed get major cities different states. Well go They're different millions people planes everywhere. allow travel, allow spread. South Africa's test positivity rate like 2%. 13% population active infection, would mean people active infection *less* likely uninfected seek testing. Start rooting Covid becomes immensely easy cope. enough stupidity go around, Covid might eventual winner. Well say this. think US gonna lock either idiots fooling themselves. Even worst delta single state shut indoor dining. Yes would. Look polio's death rate compared covid-19. Paralytic polio fraction cases existed mortality rate paralytic polio slightly higher covid-19's overall death rate probably woefully undercounted.

If COVID targeted children physically disfigured people would old news. I'd say sample size small make conclusions. Age structure also going play role.

**Age structure**

- Botswana:
-- 0-14 years: 30.54%
-- 15-24 years: 18.31%
-- 25-54 years: 39.67%
-- 55-64 years: 5.92%
-- 65 years over: 5.56%

- Germany:
-- 0-14 years: 12.89%
-- 15-24 years: 9.81%
-- 25-54 years: 38.58%
-- 55-64 years: 15.74%
-- 65 years over: 22.99% Pretty sure talk scientists scientists make decisions. 

“Willy nilly” sounds like claim might need little justification. ""Logical"" would things might work. Closing borders failed stop three variants spreading globally, one transmission zero chance. [Relevant  Well said. absolutely maddening. 

In line work written many pandemic plans colleagues. Many us discussed feels hard work basically thrown bin checking ""have pandemic plan"" box.    lol give cool name wtf. Evolution random per se, even though often spurred random events. Though predestined, likely get point we'd see strain highly transmissible particularly deadly emerge. selective advantages two fold. Obviously virus completely incapacitate host procured ""free ride"" spread different hosts continue lineage. addition, consider behavioral implications this. suddenly found newest dominant strain covid likely make much sicker mild flu, would drastically change actions. People would much likely ditch masks en masse resume pre-pandemic lives. Although many people already done that, still sizeable population hasn't. ""weaker"" yet transmissible strain would benefit behavioral changes ensued. Wow - that’s one wild graph

It’s great publish  Delta, largest variant, simply eat variants? One strain outcompetes fitness- basic concept evolution. Like saw Delta outcompete Alpha original version transmissible. 

No one needs infected variants one take over. Yeah what’s told public know little. People acting like setting us back March 2020. ridiculous. Oh my! going trust knee jerk reaction bureaucrats banning countries/flights willy nilly science instead? handful remaining humans Transformers develop odd affection 2000s R&amp;B.

The Omarion variant. coincidence? Meh... USA Monday. Unbelievable Manhattanites pretty good idea. omicron means “naked” Hindi language? points fact new variant spreading time across continent

With incubation time delay many people tested super obvious already covid, think safe say already worldwide enough breakouts everywhere within 2-3 weeks. get early boost Americans flew place week meal. That's ominious Wow, unvaccinated traveling. Sounds right explanation helpful. Here’s hoping “common cold” variant!! Yeah. Religion nutshell. gooooooo….. Highly unlikely. HK case tested negative 8 days positive. Don’t think viral load could build fast amount time. life over? COVID Oreo  way COVID going Germany lately , would hardly surprising Except virus spreads easily host shows symptoms. eliminates pressure host survive.

That’s primary difference SARS coronavirus. useless though. already like five countries. Travel restrictions stop original Covid one country, they're going stop something transmission Delta that's five.

After trying thing three times, failing, told ""this time difficult,"" governments keep things? Epsilon? headline ""threatening progress"" pandemic seemingly inaccurate. seem much progress made even possible. swear shit never end.. keep pushing many variants whatever possibly think keep control us all. We'll getting vaccines every little thing think of. Less right us, control them. Interesting hypothesis. Would perhaps explain waste water readings, 3x many infections previous  confirm, still fully recovered since March 2020. least vaccine gave sore deltoid. risk severe complications contracting COVID substantially higher (like 1000x higher) risk severe complications vaccine.

Billions people vaccinated, deaths related vaccination tiny. Billions contacted COVID deaths top 5 million.

If goal risk minimization, get vaccine immediately. People don’t understand evolution  that. countries still require 14-21 days quarantine would explain Dutch surge. feeling Netherlands pretty connected South Africa historically &amp; hence travellers. Also went South Africa met many Germans know Germany spiking Bruh… publicly available information variant makes much clear poses significant threat saw Delta. legitimate reasons initial Delta outbreak got missed. 
I think there's anything hidden public. maybe time spread recognized think? It’s like taking temperature happening given time. I’m sure predictions based R value that’s sophisticated modeling.  Provence August walked pharmacy got one immediately. Don’t know could changed. fargin icehole would hugely impactful could avoided early waves Northeast no, no, no! virii aware anything!  severe common cold out-compete variants, possibility end pandemic virus add 4 endemic common cold coronavirus. point even vaccine evasion critical, big severe common cold.

It's far confirm also, possibility. also know evade vaccination does, maybe even prevent infection vaccine still protect severe cases, cold like vaccinated similar severity currents variants unvaccinated, increased transmissibility may cause overload health system fast. 

Still lot unknown, speculation. Indeed. studies suggest even though antibodies wane first 2 doses, antibodies remain become honed proficient virus. booster huge amplification said antibodies. discussed TWIV episodes back.... else could explain it?

There’s large Fog War effect going here. gaps data, different countries recording data different ways etc.

So may never know exactly many people infected one time. others observed thing. E.g. Indian data closely matches you’d expect see two completed epidemic curves. One original virus, followed second caused Delta lifting herd immunity threshold. 

You see similar patterns many countries Asia Africa, including (topically) South Africa record low despite low vaccination Omicron started kick off. It’s three distinct peaks, one original virus, one Beta one Delta. Omicron alarming first place, whilst might another case increased transmissibility, might not. might immunity advantage, least vs. infection-acquired immunity South Africa. 

One common theme countries introduced mitigation measures they’ve tended poorly observed. Largely because, outside wealthy areas, isn’t support required enable them. still young, I'd cousins (RNs 20s) doing, traveling picking extra shifts ton money, flipping houses retiring early. Instead, I'm 46 year old nurse practitioner salary really want work hard anymore Here’s “gospel” article cnbc variant found Belgium.

It’s interesting states Dutch / South African lineage highest rates Covid right - Michigan, Minnesota, etc Lol classic. 

When first completely false anti-vaxx bullshit statement gets called out, pivot tried true “media fearmongering” bullshit. Boris &amp; UK basket case since pandemic started. So, yeah, questions warranted.   addiction airborne lol, also incredibly disingenuous suggest much damage society antivaxxers I’m confused. might due someone South Africa bringing Egypt person Belgium bringing Belgium Egypt felt like last year quite while, say year transpired lot really wonderful magical things happened made everything worth me…and Last year would last person believe that. So…I guess, unsolicited idea consideration: hang there, don’t want miss something you’d never expect that’s around corners make everything you’ve worth it.   Regardless semantics, contagious variant hospitalize people really not, least now, seemingly bad thing. could even good accelerates herd immunity less damage people.

As said though, really clue store us this. could end eating words hats point. @;) variant Thank you. replies comment pretty sad. much misinformation people think need mask outdoors.  Versus Reddit medical professionals? Sure, not. can’t measured both? Fluck Coming Provence like 7% vaccination rate compared 24% entire continent. Delta low prevalence. new variant nonetheless.... Fake variant US created limit black people visiting US. Racist.

Social distance. Fuuuuuck no. Done shit. Yeah, stands reason omnicorp indeed dominating delta days identified, may already.... case shutting barn door horses bolted. Masks, can’t travel, can’t work person. Yes things made life terrible. get sinking feeling real world data booster doses US also show lot lower effectiveness described countries… Remember asked imagine would happen whole world faced common, outside threat?

well... Better crawling in, surely? goes nu puns Oh thank god scientists ""New Nu variant"" tent pastors claiming could pray insects away. would mock *librul book-learned so-called bawljusts* pointing, know, out. Oh, assumed. hope agrees taking Norht Africans west. guys ask provide proof would really prefer guys backed claims

It likely could see variant going immune vaccines. COVID adapts defense mechanism thing get vaccinated time, probability eventually strain appear trick vaccineted immune system. (Link 1)

A list disease humans survived long vaccines thing (link guy gets it. First thing thought of. TIL nurses carry beds shifts. looked Germany’s numbers? That’s informed comment. virus get upset mutate further. suggest submitting new overlords beg leniency. Texas way. actually incredibly good summary.  wear mask omg gonna live

I wonder feel seatbelts  10:1 different 2:1. It’s like 100 million 50 microgram doses. Exactly thinking scenario.

You thinking thousands hospital staff deal exposed Covid every day.

You thinking millions family members deal loss loved one people chose take seriously.

You thinking regular people able receive care unrelated issues hospital beds full capacity.

There issues get point. headlines yesterday today ………………. wrong? Misleading? Uninformed? Premature? healthcare systems add surge capacity anything last year long term planning covid? hope didn’t put eggs vaccine natural immunity basket lot people still dense.  

Vancouver Canadas densely populated city 5500 people per square kilometer. Paris 21,000 per square kilometer. thought Delta Variant now. Fair. I’ll change it.  Tbf plenty non-covid relate reasons people cough, covid made us way scared aware people coughing. got full dose 100 ug Moderna mine well, got JJ go booster yet said first.....no regrets. Yup, first thing thought of. already red eyes swollen ears, insensitive clod! done humankind sad Lol. 
Hold butts  Oh no! aggressive new strain? loved Omikron: Nomad Soul, back day PC. David Bowie even wrote number songs (along various characters it) game Omicron basically theme  one said lose people, said panic, panic bad, panic makes stupid things, like buying toilet paper, remember correctly, empty toilet paper shelves save people. panic take caution, hard brain wrap head around that, stay silent, let rational people talking. don’t mean all. mask mandates live, restaurants/bars/offices open, travel, wear mask.  Im. guessing already want announce cause another toilet tissue hoarding fiasco  think, maybe, unfortunately, time optimistic come gone. know struggle. crawling depression mentally ready make positive change look work such.
The COVID hit, kicking back depression due work found losing contact friends supported climb depression. Sitting alone home thoughts.

I feeling better last months, got chance get contact people supported even got job team, still struggled negative thoughts influenced job, got better good talk boss.

Those 61 passengers quarantine right now, yet passenger gone home supposed quarantine 5 days.

Wouldn't surprise new variant tested positive. Even tested negative probably cases coming days. 1 10. That's really good! imagine many passengers tested negative, convert positive days. really incredibly awful. 

Damn..  true. median age South Africa 10 years younger US.

Still, we're early learning phase, kind information work with. anecdotes turn accurate, even sensationalized without particularly ""new"" variant. 

For example, hotel transmission story unique variant. similar occurrence observed New Zealand year [Closed-circuit television review period arrival case-patients C, D, E transfer case-patient C isolation section MIQ showed instances 3 persons outside rooms time.

Don't forget quote part too. well fuck  I'm numb drops incubation mean cannot detect infection lies dormant starts showing symptoms (incubated)? English (Reuters): Firstly listen government comes vaccines. Always mean always listen scientists say right scientists saying change decision getting vaccinated whether 1 first dose booster etc. Also unlikely vaccines completely ineffective new variant. I've read fear effect vaccines reckon least still provide significant protection severe disease.

Another thing know much new variant mean know absolutely nothing tbh amount spike proteis. Everyone's still trying figure new variant even overtake Delta since cases still super low, idea whether causes less severe cases covid Delta whether vaccines efficacy effected not. still take weeks figure out. 

And event need another shot unlikely we'll need 2-4 shots year it'll probably year shots need shots it'll probably like annual flu get annual booster shot covid. Given asthma would highly recommend get booster past 6 months since places higher risk Delta. I'd also highly recommend talking doctor since I'm sure they'd happy help concerns have. worst part would thinking you’re 2nd quarter find you’ve wrapped up. Full hospital. pick one get bed ventilator. pick? sake argument, one guaranteed die. pick. Seriously. situation. gets ventilator doctor? opinion form decides lives dies. pick one. 

That actual situation. Doctors right now. hypothetical. ~~Mouse Rat~~

Plague Rat Well, really slow handling previous outbursts, anything else. remember, Italy February - March '20 already deaths flights China still happening. Also, countries still show covid important. would feel government saying ""go get vaccinated important"" chill possible terrible mutation?

Why fucking earth country even airline allow unvaccinated individuals travel like that? Absolutely fucking ridiculous. Omicron perceie 8 widespread NYC March rest state months later.

if correct Covid NY December proved point took months Covid spread. Merck granted Emergency Use Authorization results, significantly lower bar COVID pills like Bucillamine &amp; Paxlovid open market drug manufacturers clinical trials ? Good human Hopefully true. go There's way would actually happen real world, I've long opinion need kind global crisis fund. 

Every country would pay (according means) money would used variety issues (maybe one fund). 

For Covid-19 possible epidemics would allow countries take drastic measures lock limit spread somewhat protected incredible economic cost. global community would share burden. could also used help pay vaccination campaigns. 90% vaccination rates rich country great, could amount little poorer countries develop new strains vaccination rate 

And epidemics obviously pressing issue, others. Climate change big one. We're shocked burning rain forest fossil fuel use garbage rivers many more. sit high horses judge them, we've already burned forests. we've sucked literal life blood former colonies.

If truly want developing nations stop destroying earth economic growth, pay that.  Australian overseas here. I'm sorry hear situation. feel like I'm never going easily able visit home. It'll great cost / time (quarantine) maybe I'll move back good. Finally sanity skip. find information variants point even become significant. mean it’s gonna forever.

Also there’s many unverified rumours floating around paint variant infectious (500% more) Delta lethal hits young people hard evade vaccines. Even turn untrue, rumours basically everything people fear new variant one time, governments taking pre-emotive action quickly seems suggest things going wrong fast. hope right. us haven’t lived much fourth, I’d argue substantially worse * we’re lucky Also confirm. got test Pharmacie 5th Arrondissment Paris got results 10-15 minutes. late July year. Thank you! press hard numbers, thresholds, plans off-ramps getting rid mandates restrictions. put interim measures simply trust officials comes holding end bargain removing them. worried, take booster later get better one comes out. got Moderna booster Tuesday, kicked ass like first one. Today first day arm hurt, I'm still tired. That's true. sticking point COVID nasty habit developing long COVID, happens in, studies indicate, third survivors, sometimes months apparent ""recovery."" long COVID includes nasty, life-changing effects. increased transmissibility means many **more** people catch COVID, die recover, third suffer long-term effects. it’s non-judgemental.

They don’t want name variants areas crop - know politicians idiots play games things like “China virus” “Brazil variant” whatever. variant crops particular state country, it’s fault.

So alphabet naming system neutral easy, Greek alphabet known recognisable enough people simple enough use.

It’s bit like hurricanes. slightly quirky system naming rotating list first names like Arthur Becky Chip, etc, depending region naming etc. It’s convention - doesn’t mean anything particular, it’s *a* way name things. Anyone thing pfizer et al blocked releasing patent shit new variants likely pop poorer regions filter rich world keep gravy train rona funding buy sell stocks time I’ve always said stock market goes news day used explain went down. people emptying savings covid variant world fucked. Kind weird thing say day ton travel bans got put place…… life back normal anyone family many countries travel restrictions wonder Covid mutates enough we're going need multiple vaccines deal it? least formulation multiple vaccines?  Good plan; relax treat nice soup book recover. upset friend it? yeah, we're getting there. Governor great job Covid. 

there's going wave hopefully keep wave relatively short. State Emergency Governor preparing possibility upcoming wave straining hospitals. also made alpha variant easy track. British testers started noticing huge number positive PCR tests one three genes undetected.  really decrease much actually, vaccines even without booster fairly well preventing severe sickness.

The drop talking vaccine little protection anymore. bet eat words happens. vaccinated people suddenly start get sick again, pull kids schools, stop going restaurants events even without government interference back 2020.

Saying that, currently data suggest heading let's hope stays like that. Louisiana, Florida, Texas. order. travel US Canada need negative test 72h before. return Even specific cold rhinovirus might prevent one getting delta, least tissue infected rhinovirus. working industry got hit really hard covid? Delta, overall effectiveness vaccines fallen, effective alpha still effective delta. always there, removed home quarantine countries Malaysians, Permanent Residents. It’s happened first round it, sadly. Florida!? I'd really careful using ""positive/negative"" language nowadays. told wife order toilet paper now. 

I'm hoping mistake initial data omicron we're overreacting nothing. You’re measuring media hysteria? hoarded food going poop itself. excuse lack testing. cost swabbing every passenger boarding quite small compared cost airline tickets. 

This leadership problem. Swabbing everyone gate reassure  
any passengers. certainly annoy customers. Border security national issue. It’s new. found variant July… would surely best case scenario outcompetes delta less dangerous need stop admitting people don’t medical reason get vaccinated. Stop admitting everything, even car crashes. Imagine much less would people masked got vaccinated. Great news hear Black Friday everyone goes store rage buy bunch fake discounted shit lmaoooo Welcome dystopia  Airlines make rules, countries do. travelling, get tested day 2 country travelled to. Nothing else (because vaccinated) W.H.O refrains naming Xi moves Omicron..Interesting Sounds like good news. Yes, bot. last… Liar. Typically, lot viruses, natural immunity robust vaccinated immunity. However, pay price disease. bad depending dangerous is. viruses effectively eliminated natural immune response though. it’s simple one better across board. virus causes chicken pox good example. 

With SARS-COV2, natural immunity gives varied response. body makes antibodies nucleocapsid protein well spike protein. problem it’s difficult predict individual responds. people don’t seroconvert mild illness do. 

The best chance effective protection vaccination. don’t think much doubt that. natural immunity vaccinated immunity, process virus antigens taken back germicidal centers body b-cells test new antibodies predict variants might evolve future. don’t understand lot it, it’s super interesting worth reading on. Lmao mu shit insane. time media got ahold already pretty well-established outcompete delta... nah. Roll reactionary ""what need know new COVID mu variant"" headlines. vaccines based original virus, variant of, vaccines still effectiveness it. addition, vaccine makers studying variants like Beta, Alpha, Delta developing vaccines response them.

Agreed. wanted post quote came from. Nice rebuttal!  concerning medication potential risk increasing chances getting cancer even creating super variant Covid. works creating numerous errors process replicating virus. Otherwise known variants.

The idea enough errors virus stop functional. Except indicators process could cross human cells. also creates opportunity different catastrophic version covid. One *good* things coronavirus slow evolution. medication could take away one Mu observed months scientists essentially dismissed less problem delta. month later gave name. fairness actually still problem (unlike every non-delta lineage, gone away, Mu+ continues stuff Colomia).

Omicron sequenced Tuesday, media panic started Wednesday, we've learned since certainly reassuring. entirely different scenario we've seen previous VOC. long take variant world? obviously question when, if, variant contagious badly outcompeted Delta Variant. I’m used that. 1) See thing ahead time. 2) Tell people. 3) People think you’re crazy. 4) see you’re not. 5) Take joy right. 6) good know - show people - you’re crazy. Hard pronounce lol really don’t like giving ‘start pandemic’ vibes last year. There's evidence Africa squandering vaccines.

By Oct 1, Africa received 200 million doses Africa finished administering 200 million doses early November  I'm omicron I've come souls! Yes, regular flu shot around long time take year. I’m aware vaccines safe. took mine.

My question - new variants, early reports suggest current vaccine may ineffective, given current lifestyle, worth rushing getting booster need take revised booster 100 days.

Potentially 3 shots around 1 year lot. That’s I’m saying there’s epidemiological value closing borders point. It’s political points. media’s defense wasn’t basically put travel bans single press release. ideal place? u playing game somethin? late seems. Aww shit go think put government wrong part sentence. looks silly. need see papers well ? User name checks out.  understand doses used boosters ones otherwise thrown away yes? suitable shipment Africa.

And again, variant prompted concern boosters created despite Africa ample access vaccines - people didn’t want them. Aka blessed updated story actually 61 600 ended positive.

We're fucked.

Which variant coronavirus positive tested travelers infected with, investigated soon possible.
Omikron variant

Since 12:00 yesterday afternoon, no-fly zone effect South Africa countries southern Africa due new coronavirus variant discovered there. so-called omikron variant, currently circulating mainly South Africa Botswana. According working group, variant coronavirus appears spreading faster variants.

At time outgoing cabinet announced flight ban, still two flights South Africa en route Netherlands. passengers tested Schiphol Friday afternoon. Special test lanes set airport purpose.

Travelers negative result allowed leave airport. still spend five days quarantine home. Passengers tested positive transferred guarded isolation hotel near Schiphol Airport.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) [Scott Gottlieb Twitter put together thread expert opinions lot eminent virologists list.  Good question think, ....would one wait otherwise change plans 3rd... finding much that, seems like information while. never seen many Futurama posts years.. Govt cringe ngl post. Someone posted it.  would like do? shared literally billions vaccines. Many ending trashed unused third world countries lack distribution fear vaccines provided foreign powers. infrastructure safely create vaccines themselves. Meanwhile Europe part list2ned boosters recently suffering consequences terms increased breakthrough infections. Shut dude. know, people understood one fact, ocean productive debate would available general public. still young. 24 25 still young. hang there. get better.  late that, already everywhere. think you’re getting downvoted you’re kind jerk. suppose happen there's new variants on-going infection? actually   say cannot contain covid, ok exactly issue ignored happened, new variant, we're gonna yo-yo thing mandates, boosters, shutdowns, masks, testing every time there's potential variant? ""study"" see concern not? one, concern, pretend ok even though variants recombinant parts past variants? two, ok turns big concern, late anyway train left station?? thought vaccine doesn’t protect much transmission 70 percent sampled white tailed deer USA antibodies covid-19

Can link study? Thank you. eternity cheap ass labor. Maybe they’re paying rest world back. 🤷‍♂️ Part first booster really booster like boosters waning immunity, first shots enough first place - that's I've understood.

Not sure government much private companies developing vaccines place knows. 

Additional shots seem foreign me, given that's many past ones like. Mmr, chicken pox, etc know. Boosters definitely way better relying something like this. wondering, since can’t quite find data whether exposure without infection anything immune system. Would cool did, boosters obviously safer route regardless. think Nu sounded much like Mu would invite much confusion Xi variant would invite much focus name rather science probably decided skip Omicron result. Banning peoples South Africa... seems bit racist me. Even worst delta spike, nowhere near shut even lessened capacity Sputnik one encouraging, given many people tried claim ineffective.

And claimed this? Many studies already published - Satellite consistently shows good effectiveness (against Delta strain well) literally every pandemic ended, becomes endemic mutates something less virulent. Virology 101.  Google vaccines safe, are, you’ll get answer. regular flu shots every year nobody issues it. got really bad Pfizer 2 booster felt completely fine. took day nothing lol want risk ""What science telling us along large populations unprotected virus, mutate,"" David McNair, executive director global policy ONE Campaign, told DW. ""It's tragedy today we're seeing come pass,"" ""Hoarding vaccines, funding global response, supporting TRIPS waiver — things led situation. sad thing EU countries, North America, Canada others power change year ago chose to,"" said. Brazil high vaccination rate (at 60%, higher US). heard Brazilians people protect experiencing scary times. Hope new strain (Omicron?? Really?) turns less virulent Delta.  Agreed Meh I've seen worse 1 day losses normal bad news non covid related. Omicron sounds horrible sounds like transformer. Egregiousuck no. Stay positive. Stay away clickbait! fully evade B cells vaccines! many people died vaccine? I’m antivax, wondering.  article full maybes. like articles saw lambda. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Probably…. 
Actually, definitely… NOBODY CARES ANYMORE must missed ""severe sickness"" part comment.  Hey I'm arguing that'd great. Use largest job program actually something useful. getting sick like cold, getting sick like flu able stay home getting sick point needing go hospital get mortality rate.

Vaccines far good job even without boosters hospitalization mortality. ever changes, increase precautions. way around it. power public private partnerships! government good at, funding ambitious projects dealing regulations ensure safety. Private companies best at, research development products bringing market. Obviously bit oversimplification parties jobs general point everyone working together actually solve problems hand. Thank you!! bring non-healthcare workers. feel HBO Go VS Netflix. better value? Honestly wouldn’t surprised Michigan already. Cases seem earlier expected every variant Pfizermectin fool's gold. Well, mortality rate &amp; severe sickness, tends result long term health problems. general, yes, Unicron. Dude bad way. interviews 20th anniversary release, 86 Movie director Nelson Shin claimed Welles incredibly poor health time arrived record dialogue, mentioning heavyset required wheelchair move. Shin also detailed Welles' recordings labored barely usable, requiring great deal post-recording modification use Unicron's lines. 1. 2 weeks always bullshit-it ill thought social media propaganda devised keep people calm
2. Vaccines work well-however vaccines good ending pandemic vaccination occur. number theorized 70% looks closer 95-99% overall population now.
3. Delta variant hadnt taken root 70-80% vaccinations countries wouldnt pandemic anymore

One bigger mistakes getting fixated 70% number. Given even OG strain caused substantial damage even young people aimed 95% vaccination benchmark beginning. hindsight 20:20 Anyone citing two week thing likely trolling. one actually still hung you’re actually discussing appropriate measures virus think flu Corona like cold, Corona virus. Thing people understand virus vs bacteria is, types viruses necessarily determine severity virus viruses mutate actually body. media fear mongers purpose

And want think keep everyone precaution someone trained surgery handle Covid patients? It’s early make claim. early stage, single major super-spreader event could explain it. don’t know enough yet. Literally driving past Houston road trip home. huge smoke billowing city spring break 2019. every one sort operating fire bombed. 

So turned twitter realized, nothing see another massive industrial accident Texas. Use military help then. already paid can't quit.  used lot spread Gauteng, managed suppress Delta variant. like Delta variant disappeared though.. still there. increasingly small numbers, competitive Omicron moment Gauteng. x100000. Even Canada drag's ass EVERYTHING acted immediately. Never listen politician says, pay attention do. This. I'm 100% sure people think cold flu similar branding counter cold flu medications.

I got flu last year, fuck thought going die. Literally every bone body hurt get bed good amount days. worst shit ever.

Most people gotten flu, assume similar cold. get flu once, get vaccinated every year soon available. ain't going shit again, ever.  brought non-medical staff. certain plenty regular people could trained Covid procedures within months.

Covid dangerous enough us significantly change things.  Grim number mutations rapid spread guess. 

There's LOT know yet. genuinely know shit strain broader public, right now. first 2019 wave wake call upgrade bidets. Made switch, never going back. think mean nutations. right many vulnerable people able get vaccinated. However, unclear effective vaccines lot vulnerable people. E.g., many persons receiving chemo fully vaccinated but, chemo receiving/their immune systems, vaccines effective. would go further. could trained lay people handle Covid patients within month two. problem regulations say certified full set care Covid dangerous enough us make change procedures. Looks like governments dont want make mistake early 2020. flights cut quarantines imposed pandemic bad. think ""abundance caution"" thing. apple jacks slang anus taste like ass.  fully vaccinated father recently fairly bad case covid. day two people family knew died it. fifties, obese, healthy far knew, vaccinated. Today learned another two stats. 
I'm pro-vaccine, course, booster, I'm getting bit terrified people care half giving returning normal world. :( virologist belgian news confirmed this. extra time see handle/treat variant major impact. Thanks this! go Never thought I’d say this, pandemic opened eyes important private companies. thankful for-profit institutions charge vaccine development instead government. Based US government handled pandemic, would terrified vaccine development hands alone. Yes. Thank you. I've saying whole time shit gonna stop trying end humanity humans think know anything virus. know small fraction true anyone thinks know everything viruses arrogant ignoramus. Covid eagle landed. “decrease effectiveness public health social measures available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics”

Good news previously described variants haven’t evolving presence new antivirals likely still good tool while. sure vaccines virus evolves evade immunity. Indefinite lockdowns seem question. N95s broadly available folks want one many places. think beyond rejiggering vaccines developing new therapeutics, think we’re stuck virus time accept that, ya know? Israel think though. Okay. One Q today:

If/when Pfizer etc. tweak vaccine(s) need studies/seek approval etc. again? much speedier? vaccinated people getting sick long time. Delta caused ton breakthrough infections. Vaccinated people already get sick. lot vaccinated people get sick actually. argument die. getting sick bar looking Omicron brand Covid. mortality rate. ???? Ohio you? Columbus mask mandate I’d say prob like 90% people follow it. Good time buy stocks. Thank needed  Historically speaking every single time government media tries downplay something blew spectacularly faces. I'm going go recent history cautious. good news governments around world proactive once, might get caught guard time.  always knew Gwyneth Paltrow planet little spread Gauteng emerged there, outcompeted anything. I’m fully vaccinated also got COVID prior vaccinated. recently exposed COVID heavily long period time, never got (confirmed multiple PCR tests different times whole ordeal). think got immune boost all, nah? data that? know sure. also know even deadlier Delta likely be. still need drastic measures.  anything indicate higher fatality rate? Depends live U.S. Last year around time, city, shut indoor dining, movie theaters, museums. etc. heavily limited capacity left open, schools still mostly closed. Thankfully currently talk happening (we still wear masks, places limit capacity voluntarily, city mandate). supposed take work trips Germany late January mid February. looks like canceled. Anti Vaxxers anti maskers need held account fucking society rest us. I’m getting tired it.  confirming anything. statement genome hedge, using words like ""may"" ""potentially"". know anything variant actually behaves Welp. guess spreading fear lack information door. speculation sensationalisim current point time. don’t enough information. I'm assuming higher death \*rate\* catch Omicron (we know yet), fact higher total number people infections means given set number deaths COVID infections general, higher number people die. Grim how? it’s spreading fast? Imagine Americans banded together indiscriminate hidden killer way 9/11. Bad comparison sure, concept unity response sudden threat fabric countries identity polar opposite vibe communities sad know possible likely get anytime soon. Even something major happened. would even division fear..  call Apple Jacks doesn’t even taste like apples think so. publicly available data pretty grim. Naw. make apple flavoured. wish variant knocks sense stupid ppl..  much training someone really need handle Covid? 

Surely could train people handle one virus fairly quickly. assumed worst part would last 5 years based long Spanish flu lasted, would become nuisance avoid yearly booster rest life. Lol agreed - bought one, want Seamaster slandered There's something wrong article dated. first link links article dated November 25. unless author see future July date wrong. Might it’s also possible consider pronounced entirely differently. people would likely struggle pronunciation Xi Greek alphabet.  posted Wall Street thought include article found Russia. It’s hard find English article Russia. ship sailed flight flown? based assumption everyone exposed... point think instead total cases worried getting vaccines. Citizens starting demand return rights Government, better introduce new ""Variant"" Covid-19. want give power...  Back sewer poop testing us live alone. Welp got 2022 covered... Pray 23 it'll get better Flu add promised years never arrives. I’m calling vapourware. Well seems like big jump? know they’re letting   gathered, is, effectively, medical reason refuse vaccination, like medical reason prevent mask wearing. people exceptions would very, few. mean, quickly outcompeted Delta led surge cases Gauteng certainly concerning... 

And although many mutations mean anything own, fact accumulated many mutations studied past impact, creating surge area problem suppressing Delta certainly seem concerning, it? 

Hospitalization risk really good piece news I'm expecting might come in. Biggest concerns transmissibility, current vaccine efficacy, lethality. 

None known yet. Welp don’t remember seat belts gave disease…so… Guardian bad every newspaper UK clickbait crap scaremongering. Good point, thanks clarifying. going give free award gone! Cheers anyway!   many, most. kids 13 required tested. However, test used Rapid Antigen Test best earliest stages infection. PCR much sensitive takes longer. think you’re forgetting economic/cultural achievements led fall Soviet Union…  live different continent family. seen two years. fully vaccinated. travel? pronounced? back. Honestly, holiday wonders mental health. Travelling pretty much live pre-Covid, think black white stay home. course abided rules needed to, vaccinated, COVID pass etc. think unreasonable all.

I live different continent family. seen two years. fully vaccinated. travel? 10% people plane infected what's point travel restrictions? seriously reason believe past week percentage would significantly different? I’m gonna say it…please lock everyone back down! starting love new introverted person real world busy life started back. wait virus mutates like 30% death rate year worry yeah humanity collapse years, materials low, war break steal resources ontop corona, Goodluck   Also assuming vacinnated, prerequisite international travel Maybe it’ll make people take things serious ominous names all. don’t enjoy wearing either. op said “mask-phobia” imaging people act like wearing one going kill them. Complaints also correct translation. suspect foxhound read correctly joking. It’s funny too! Thanks translation thanks foxhound making good job. currently lowest cases South Africa since covid began, although we've seen curve change past 2 weeks. 2400 new cases reported yesterday population 55million. Dutch article passengers age 13 flying South Africa Netherlands required show negative rapid test maximum 24 hours old upon boarding. EU citizens allowed KLM flights 2-5 years humanity collapse due mutations claiming 70%+ death rate, remember comment mutate get upset? told teenage daughter thing earlier, want call nu deal nu covid, decide ominous transformer sounding name!? reassuring! Yes, know. interesting see approval process also becomes faster since underlying technology You’re welcome! Enough gloom doom. vaccines work, variants completely new viruses. think could use bit optimism. know could use some. Delta variant would like word you. still believe that? said around 85 initially around 15%.

And u add others probably 30-40%. ppl also probably vaccinated also. Symptoms. (I speak Dutch.) Historically, unusual major waves disease kill large chunks population -- proportionally, lot COVID. end world. Things different years, return sort normalcy, think abruptly realize. us currently experiencing bear memories, next generation read history books one things.

Of course, climate change make things pretty abnormal whole set ways. COVID? Society get move on, countless times past. R0 40 seems really high. said, possible guess? RACIST! Oregon brought masks back that's virus first hit Germany Jan. 2020, medical professionals said worry cases mild. dealing even fewer known cases new variant, mostly young people. early tell. Cool story bro Melbourne cold year, feels like early spring instead almost summer.  close borders countries outside Europe already? keeo bringing variants (yes, aware case Belgium variant originated Africa brought back tourism). Reminds doctor Arrested Development.  people immune good advice. personality dependent iq. people influenced accommodating personalities name variant zeta variant? Even though benefit vaccines course almost like companies producing vaccines treatments may fudged things profit name ""good intention"" first one finish line... 

Apparently new study works shown mRna vaccinations create 25% risk acute coronary/cardiovascular events within first 2.5 months injection... Waiting study fully released peer reviewed. 

Believer science really feeling duped days incompetent leaders profit business. Damnnn state in? city wear masks 💯 Original source 10% people confirmed positive. 


Source: Dutch news original article Reuters citing from. 

Question many 600 passengers infected due proximity positive cases airplane. 
And many actually effective quarantaine without infecting family friends.  Lol oh Georgia. said so. one main epicenters stupid. Get south totally different. realized last year took stock house freezer pantry habitually full, water emergency tanks filled up, large sack tp (the local football team children sells large sacks get income) hit us become middle aged. 

We kind thought vere quite young still, honestly, middle age thing always 10 kg flour 10 kg meat stored. waiting Pi. That's definitely why, right decision. Politics aside confusing (and potential fuel conspiracy theories). world leader political persuasion named Omicron, I'm sure would skipped too. also skipped Nu easily confused ""new"". fear-mongering headline. U including hospital people survived aid? People get overbooked hospitals died. 
Or people would died without vaccine.
Your facts true, skewed favour Sorry wrong place (in case, could get info) I'm curious info regarding traveling UK. 

Before pandemic frequently traveled UK, 6-8 times year attend concerts on. sometimes even stay hotel country 24 hours stayed airport.
I read travel UK (from EU, specify) even fully vaxxed (Pzier), must take test day 2 also fill passenger locator form. 
My question is, fill form order test taken UK I'm going little time. anybody else experience traveling UK EU short period late? usually even hotel address test delivered. Something may cause issue trying leave country later perhaps. hilarious post generic could either camp. Can't tell wrote. lol. illustrated ""both sides"" post, actually bothered describe details two camps extremely differently.

Also I'm definitely ""center"" two politically. lol. Independent mean center. Stop watching cable news. Moronic=the anagram Omicron. Jokes you. Awh shit, go again. remains ""as"" deadly is, it'll still mean deaths get (more infections). vaccine protection lost, it'll mean even death even new mRNA vaccine 100 days it'll take months vulnerable immunized. South Africa also [very compared [population United African President lives big presidential palace form big pyramid. Poor testing equipment/training/standards one end, better quality other. think already world, point , air travel. Imagine 600 random flyers, 1 10 infected variant. enough time catch virus test positive (in 24 hours), means infected boarding plane. 

Think that. 1 10 random SA flyers. 

It's going easy ride. it. I’m beginning think ripped world already, cold everyone recently negative rapid pcr tests 

Don’t pay particular attention PCR test gene drop out? Xi? next Greek letter reaction really quickly. Actually night sweats too. results. 61 positive. 10 percent total. Good think sent Lois lane fly gather paperwork pandemic, would lost via email. game game. Holy shit µg

I got full dose 3rd too. Asked Moderna getting 2 Pfizers not. Damn mess dose 1 &amp; 2. Still hoping pays off. Someone else wrote presented negative tests *before* flew. concerning. super high vax rate Marin County (Bay Area) really surprised me. Pre-pandemic relatively low vaccination rates Portland still fluoridated tap water. probably antigen tests flight PCR tests landing.  That's 100 days start production? rollout goes anything like last time live, another 6 months till gets arm. So, nine months hiding house, leaving groceries again. nine months, anytime thereafter, threat yet another variant. difficult overcome depression situation. Oh matter time. infection rate dramatically increasing fear tgis variant factor. spreading rapidly ever before. protect point. God bless us all. Turned 61 positive COVID. 

Why flying? can't make phone call? South Africa reporters? 

Freaking pandemic guy acts like fly get paperwork. 1940? tests sent randomly CDC sequence them. would know already. maybe USA already certainly acting promptly. course. think relatively higher risk vs. countries implied. vaccination coverage fairly recent ramped quickly, much larger percentage people natural immunity, demonstrably better immunity conferred vaccination. I'd very, surprised variant able evade natural vaccinated immunity entirely.  South Africa sitting 5 months worth vaccine supply current rate use. They've recently asked manufacturers slow deliveries, kept receiving using.

Vaccine availability around world great (but improving). probably what's behind emergence variant. one thing look crossing street, another thing live fear. another thing compromise daily life certainly another thing allow governments assert control variant frightening worrying

Show scientist said variant frightening worrying.  Lemme guess, English Literature? course cause them. current strain causes them, vaccinated friend landed hospital (before could get third dose unfortunately). Get booster ASAP. Lol, friend, swapped moter scion xb ... 1000$. slow, danm easy work on.  must stay seven days complaints five days complaints.

""Ah man, come on! really stay *five* frickin' days? sucks.""

""You made *seven* days, genius."" people want people suffer. Probably religious thing, suspect that's behind big chunk antivaxxers. Even little evasion tragic. Look Delta Europe despite vaccines waned bit. boat age. gone rest lifetime link? saw curious followed people vaccinated agree 100%. vaccination disagree. Traveling important part modern world, brings great benefits humanity general. There's end sight, can't stop traveling forever. yeah traveling unvaccinated that's reckless I'm irritated people too. Corona 19 plus max S? don’t think understand modern conservatism America. It’s opposite traditional American values despite loudly claim media propaganda they’re “real” America.

Modern conservatives group think around central authority figure (Trump, FOX News) bend ass backwards corporate oligarchs, McMansion loudmouths, even foreign enemies like Russia/China keep “patriotism” facade milk brainwashed rubes best maybe. Might new enough time passed people start dying Yeah man! Stay unvaccinated, work well family gonna lie, pretty much sounds like like living UK right lol. One theory virus spreads vaccinated people dont notice cause dont get sick/tested. eventually causes someone get sick discover it. reality probably everywhere already.

I friend whose vaccinated got covid19 idea. got tested due close contact  markets havent reacted covid longest time, governments travel bans real time markets clearly reacting. Obviously wall street government info whats released public, there’s definitely something dont know do. 

Basically money lost en mass, bet something ignore. could vaccinated entire american population twice cost. They're losing goddamn minds media helping. like everyone jumped cliff. Triple vaxxed ready anything going back March 2020 people.   go yet complain adding federal deficit breath. wondering someone explain. read Nature article new South African variant B.1.1.529. article said would called Nu variant. recent reports, B.1.1.529 called Omicron. Nu Omicron same, official name changed different? want clear. Thanks explanation advance. aliens invaded, 1/3 people would roll welcome mat. ""At least political party dont like!"" sure projecting. came looking sincere help - bullies. didn’t take stance, asked question I’m injecting things body reports come saying longer effective. Keep laughing. laugh talk people, they’re going keep perfect people like pandemic. Try helping people bullying Yes that’s said they’re desperate it. booster new variant easily 100+ days away. scenario getting 3-5 booster shots per year variants. next years likely 1-2 per year MAX. 

Get booster expect another catch-all booster July. there, future booster requirements largely dictated many people remain unvaxxed. post - nothing doomsday posts everyone else. I'm care anymore  I‘m surprised topic needle phobia isn‘t discussed more. According Wiki prevalence 4-10 %, survey 571 respondents puts 7.5 % 95 % confidence interval 5.5 % 9.5 %. Germany roughly 20 % adults remain unvaxxed. significant portion unvaxxed, maybe one three, could suffer needle phobia. really therapists vaccination centers assist people vaccination process. Maybe even provide sedatives like diazepam. given fear flying helped great deal. Seems kind weird isn‘t proper support structure place vaccination centers given high prevalence.  Could novavax potentially option may adverse reactions one mRNA vaccines? media headline writers, us vaxxed might catch higher rates, might even fever days. evidence strain cause hospitalizations. 32 years knowing non-Covid world. Good times, sad see go. 

Slowly accepted former world gone. kind like roller coaster, though. fight ride, bad time possibly die.   bother get booster? Lmfao, saying got previous one, top first two shots? What's changed? Viruses mutate bro, somehow think SARS COVID even delta-COVID, makes sense, strains...? xD

Lmfao, get booster moral line sand, get virus eventually, give shit. flying Usa negative test doctor note saying covid I'm last 6 weeks. flew back Mexico last month checking everybody got plane don’t think it’s particularly grim yet (sounds like cases far mild), it’s don’t know enough 2 years, cities like New York aren’t willing fuck around find could be.  Yes, varies based study area.

""From April December last year, 30% deer tested positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test. winter surge Iowa, Nov. 23, 2020, Jan. 10 year, 80% deer tested infected. peak surge, Kapur says, prevalence virus deer effectively 50 100 times prevalence Iowa residents  think NYC brunt overseas travel probably good plans place call early proaction opposed late reaction. Michigan living? Plenty people travelling, I, wait, pushes booster. worth waiting? Again, don’t want 3-5 shots year amounts vaccine ineffective. unsure act I'm saying definitely happen, nobody predict anything, we've found last 2 years, I'm saying there's non-zero chance may. 

As in, it'll definitely go another 2 months, probably go another 12 months, could go another 2 years, may go another 5. 

We know. can't control it. react. 

Being mentally prepared way be. Even means changing life goals and/or career.  meanwhile delta actively decimating people US countries first strain two taken seriously... Discounting every new strain new dumb vaxxing period imo, people tried delta saw worked out. xD win situation. US cant lockdown like 2020. Businesses still hurting then. People working. Government can't pay people stay home forever rent moratoriums gone. top tons people need medical treatments non related covid delayed. hail Omicron considered many clicks article would get? Definitely. think area 40% vaxed last time checked. I'm burnt trying convince people anything. say people able ignore it, literally know people who've family die continue walk around maskless unvaccinated. Meanwhile I've missed lot living past years. woe anything, I'm burnt angry. True, South Africa steady vaccine supply travelers get vaccinated within airport stop wished. corona beer sales sank early pandemic, predict one would buy Omega watches Omega kill us all. Yep. reason it’s “not yet” don’t sequence enough samples know it’s already here. Monday latest, they’ll find multiple states. rules changing bit starting November 30th. trips shorter 72 hours need test since people could get test, cross border, come back Canada test result. I'm sure applies land border crossing land  Immunity wane. would get boost esp winter coming new variant. foolish, going arrive via somewhere else. can't individually target single country travel block disease like this. highly likely already anyways. read earlier today says 33%. Maybe different study many antivirals pipeline? We've got Pfizer one. else? understanding South Africa best scientific infrastructure place detecting new variants entire world. variants keep evolving there, South Africa first country notice them. extremely hard stay rational person this. empathy others two braincells responsible logic thing keeping pretending pandemic over. yeah want another booster 😩😩😩 6 months 2nd shot, know got mine day.  Hell media thriving fear entire pandemic. observation. make less depressing. want life back.  Great point. really battle survival society, like WW2 was, would pulled way stops. I’m sure least three sixteenth life left Easiest thing ever do. likely experience arm pain injection site. Almost everyone gets that. mom pretty big immune reaction - bed days slight temperature, chills, headache nausea...but TON health problems. arm pain, slight temperature chills. popped tylenol went work next day. Covid WAY WAY WORSE. sue, lose.

They right fly. works ignorant fucking brainlet. Yep, husband got sick shit literally figuratively quit 2 months ago. haven’t seen little anxiety years since quit. I’m early 30s feel like world done absolutely dirty Covid, housing, inflation, etc. can’t even imagine bleak must kids 10+ years junior graduating high school college shit.  headlines don’t worry me... swift government action does. 

Yeah, like someone saying there's need panic getting lifeboats swung position. worry heart issues already 2 doses adverse effect, seems like would make rare event even rarer. people get five fifths get three thirds ducking sucks man. One passengers NYT, can’t much she’s stuck. intel actually coming reporters getting info government took hours hours tell info. It’ll big morning eats gets little sleep. Don’t tell that!!!! don’t think take another year let alone 5! Masks vaccines live mental health can’t take lockdowns social distancing I’m already suicidal half time 2 years this. people things responsibly first don’t think we’d predicament!!!! thought wayyyy back beginning mess. thought would band together. Unfortunately, one thing I've learned we're country thought were. Which, seeing 2 years division snarking, seems naive. Lesson learned. new variant evade current vaccines. panicking. Wait data points.   Omicron also planning continuing normal. Perhaps saving sweeps  ED also symptom/sign cardiovascular issues. also ring alarms potential long term effects it. tell years come. That’s incubation period works. WTF South Africa?! country keeps major mutation site, though know huge section misinformed pop HIV/AIDS (the 'rape virgin cured' idea still exists tribes north), one developed African nations make much sense keep new strains emerge there... Meanwhile almost half americans think hoax non-lethal. Ugh. find link story explained phenomenon., keep happening there? government mask vaxx mandates? (And tell poor support these, lol, much gemstone wealth nation, even that's still privatized European companies, though idea would point time.) 15th nearly 100% Delta prior Omicron. non-Delta C.1.2, holding Delta SA low levels months. 

The low vaccination rate true, SA able suppress Delta despite 24% vaccination rate. NY hit hard thing came Italy, everyone eyes China West Coast. They're going proactive that. husband’s guess too. like option it’s colder people inside closed windows conducive. Along international travel hub. 

However think it’s anyone’s call Thanksgiving yesterday biggest travel day year 2 days ago. week would sure thing, week’s travel means massive reshuffle everyone different states back normal state usually tightly packed airplanes airports. Yes. know deer getting COVID-19 could directly humans intermediate host like cows, horses, field animals interact humans deer think likely explanation. I'm sorry feeling way. Many people feeling way. mother broke became depressed night sobbing uncontrollably scared. 

But reality is, take precautions. Get vaccinated, get booster shot, mask avoid crowds. know really give shit? virus.    takes major superspreading events locally due precautions due high levels delta spread.

Then people became much less careful coronavirus starts spread again. lucky virus involved outbreak first virus transmitted first major superspreading event.

The plausible chain healthcare worker taking care COVID infected HIV-AIDS patients became infected Omicron, due poor practices spread infection around several people, Omicron got lucky infected socialite infected 50 people one first new wave superspreading events, 10 went events later week.

It sounds somewhat unlikely variants arisen, luck. Event delta able outcompete prior variants without luck side somewhere. dominant variant always advantage likely variant selected given superspreading event. delta take first area made foothold human population?

Given enough time delta's competitive advantage makes successful blows dice, overcome outnumbered 100:1 first well get lucky. Back started salaried employees took 10% paycut non clinical employees furloughed point everyone lost raises. wife behind 6% hourly would this. I've told she'd make lot tried finding new job, comfortable people works with.  really know Brazilian politics all, excuse ignorance, much power Bolsonaro truly have? appears parts Government making decisions now, despite says. believe even saw article earlier today Brazil would banning flights African countries. going ok people. excuse end year profit taking. bad catalyst good catalyst. It'll rally quickly.  live different continent family. seen two years. fully vaccinated. travel?

You shoud travel, live continue, test procedure exist safe.

I return home country two years too.

we learn live it. I'm originally UK currently live Amsterdam (really looking forward flight back home now) accept rapid one PCR airports rapid test station set take get results back around 15 minutes, allowing fly unreliable they'd miss 61/61 infections. Something still weird. it’s true, all. That's true Delta, they're saying Omicron evades antibodies, booster restores. mean we're pretty much risk Delta pre-booster? Would ok people carrying HIV Virus disclose sexual contacts, insisting sex without condom, one force wear condom tell say? 
The person still refuse sex without condom, people refuse serve, fly, drive, teach, interact form people vaccinated Corona. That's body autonomy. 


When everyones life depends everyone elses cooperation contain virus threatening millions lives, think part. 
If chose body autonomy important, surprised society gives timeout. 


I think order protect everyone society, including antivaxers themselves, people forced comply. I’m right you. feel entirely hopeless I’m middle divorce child. barely find strength get bed. Yawn. go again.

Covid real folks wrong still irritated continue travel willy nilly non essential reasons still unpredictable pandemic?

SA country low infection rate, peoples bot travel?

You mad peoples going holiday, ok.
But don’t forget many peoples work tourism industry two year long travel restriction millions sliding poverty, maybe even extreme poverty now. effective preventing milder disease — we’ve still got understand.”

So let’s shut world might get sniffles? so-called rapid tests. They're faulty hell. 42% cases, test giving false test results. ""Just get man I'm listening factors make neccessary"" 

Very cringe pushing someone who's already 2 shots hard bro japanese washlet want go future butt sanitation, also want warm seat That’s known yet, better understood couple weeks recently go? visited August, saw plenty non-masked/improperly masked patrons tables. can’t speak countries UK sequences huge amount PCR tests, yes. already would know it. seems happened suddenly though, we’ll probably start notice popping week. still clear escapes vaccine protection leads severe disease.

Did read article contains comments medical professional one country variant prevalent? Don’t know science ignorant people downvoting it’s true everyone eventually get covid. get vaccinated protect yourself. Since vaccinated get infected spread virus like unvaccinated. know got covid 3 months full vaccination. hope you’re right Omega? Oh didn’t see anything medical professional tests article rapid tests performed home. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Rapid tests definitely accurate PCR, sounds like given destination also rapid tests. it’s media leaping onto this. declared variant concern REMARKABLY fast, WHO, scientists, doctors, virologists, governments, concerned. It’s media declared major concern, media implemented travel restrictions. first time I’ve heard experts downplaying seriousness variant, fastest they’ve jumped it. wish could mentality I’m really scared want agree badly shelves empty certain products saw 500-1000% increase daily demand. empty people drove round shop shop buying buy limits shit need could ensure OK expense everyone else community.

You seen bins local pandemic, EVERY WEEK people throwing 10+ loaves bread per household, rotten fruit kilo, etc etc.

JIT always struggle increase demand, ""people doubling halving frequency shops"", people deciding came everyone else ensuring throw ton away bought magnitudes needed.

We could doubled volume deliveries would happen people would buy throw 2 weeks later fucking used it. Maybe I’m old, situation looks like tests taken way would maximize chance negative result. Could infected airport. allowed approved tests done medical professionals, rapid antigen tests accepted though, hear less reliable PCR ... assholes decide outcompete sense, does. No. vaccine effectiveness wanes time. booster recharges it. Apparently 6 months booster restore protection second shot. really don’t like giving ‘start pandemic’ vibes last year.

the start pandemic nealry two years ago:(

~20 months  literally days away. Europe already. Overselling side effects there? lots side effects, side effects extremely rare. agree I've probably 10 vaccines whole life. want them? Flu, MMR, smallpox, covid... numerous others. Sounds like there’s market fake test certificates, otherwise variant royally sucks I’ll none it. Airplanes cycle air rather quickly, though means less infection really can't say. cycle air several times per hour. tests inaccurate fuck. Despite manufacturer claims high sensitivity actual sensitivity mere 42,6%. Meaning half infected persons tested fly radar. known since July 2021. course gvts could bothered inconvenience loud crazy high number indeed.

What might part explanation cases record high moment Netherlands. Last week 1 100 people tested positive tested. lot people test sympthoms people might asympthomatic. 1 one 100 stat. given people might still test positive PCR eight weeks might partially explain high number. want know? black death kind pandemic watching us dark waiting mess much? Though worry much, already vaccines birds humans, danger get those, though bird type works fine, prime defense.  least bad overreaction. need get Reddit dude. Vax take precautions almost surely fine. death rate fully vaxxed person what? Like less 0.001%? 

Try worry much SEM photos new Omicron viral protein shell thing, infected cells look like? fuck one plane space 600 people? someone heavily markets, that's false. reaction Delta anywhere close initially point violent dramatic reaction saw Omicron. 

The Omnicorn reaction Friday textbook reaction initial virus. Whether continue forward anyone's guess. Ni sounds even worse, like something Monty Python. Autobot Deciptcon? Well that's good sign world never fully vaccinated speically Japan America nobody america cares anymore would test it? Lab tests computer simulations get far. variants SARS-CoV-2 expected quite bad based mutations, ended causing much trouble. hand, Delta seemed many problematic mutations ended wrecking many countries.

The way accurately verify modified version virus desired properties test humans, incredibly risky bottomless pit medical ethics concerns. get 10 shots it? ""Nothing lose""? Lots side effects boosters (heart issues) that's someone who's gotten 2 already. Yep realisticly last 2024/2025 Funny since I've heard anecdotally opposite boards 3rd booster worst far. awful experience 2nd one. You’re gonna leave Australian summer cold dreary UK December, 21 hours plane back, two weeks, midst new variant, existing pandemic ??? Sounds like transmits worse delta appears posted Reddit.

But I’ll stick “appears that”, case I’m strange dream.

Or 500 years future playing immersive history simulator, case whole pandemic game really sucks want try something else now. one horses dysentery. Thanks French attuide hilarious great aren’t wrong tho teacher, I'm really hoping new variant lead another period remote learning. Kids already huge learning deficit (from experience). Plus, amount mental health issues associated lockdowns. Hopefully, get point again. States one year people aren’t gonna wear masks forever states forget I'm sure Unicron. don’t enough data yet make conclusion. 

So far limited data Omnicron R value &lt;2. Delta R value 2 3. Omincron 30 mutations spike protein. remains seen exactly Omnicron be. Even secret, like asshole US Congress people used insider knowledge buy sell start pandemic hid truth public  booster half dose original shot. wonder unvaccinated even allowed airplanes. seen gf 2 years. fully vaxxed travel? sure millions position. T-Virus ? 🧟‍♂️ Realisticly it’s gonna last 2024 Yes June cases covid lowest ever within 6-8 weeks delta ruined that. cases fell October see VOC does. think nothing issue. Delta already reduced vaccine efficacy little. 5 months vaccination, efficacy declines even more. Omicron bound decrease efficacy further. Thus, get infected Omicron 5 months vaccination, immunity bound low. Rather wait another 6 12 months updated Moderna booster, better boost increase immunity. booster reportedly increases antibodies substantially. certainly get booster soon I'm eligible month time. would kinda cool though Except people lot less willing follow rules now. Maybr new variant change, I'm hopeful. temp workers come agency, owned whom? got covid vaccinated. least require quarantine? try keep stocked canned food. got quarantine ( done per year far due ended viral infections ) want variety enjoyable foods. Canned foods fantastic ease use. Omicron small o, lock, bog.

Omega large o, bored, bloke Well Austria Slovakia lockdown seems looks like Europe next epicenter Omicorn Fuck motherfucking virus happened replenish TP today, yay! Last time caught almost out. give water University phoenix entered chat   Hundreds passengers arriving Amsterdam South Africa tested new variant. 61 people two KLM flights tested positive quarantined. wait 'til get Omega they’re testing themselves, user error would definitely come play. incubation period week, wouldn’t caught passengers test 24 hrs 61 people tested positive pcr test flight.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Numbers trending upwards realization vaccines seem enough prevent spread made people nervous. Several countries also starting reintroduce restrictive measures, anyone England reading happens rest Europe would reason concern. less half kids get picked tests, makes sense bring vaccination clinics schools instead wasting money invasive procedure pretty brutal done repeatedly. area, hell time finding someone vaccinate kid 5-11yo range, imagine lot parents didn’t get one kid that. Look, might disagree, understand coming good place. Things suck time being.  Well confirmed cases now. covid SARS! It’s literally SARS-ncov-2 Thank response. definitely talk doctor getting booster. actually really missed reference…. Indeed, that's generally happened NL. closing time 5pm that's enough stop people going all. previous 12am closing time stop going events required travel time impact enough. ignorant minority people refusing vaccine (even though obtain it) also small minority compared people developing countries don’t even access vaccine. even get American/European “antivaxxers” board, we’re still fucked mutations happening poor countries vaccine access. Talk dark age man. definitely noticing decay ""old"" Western civilization, mostly English-speaking. level moronic behavior US, UK, Australia charts. feel like lights going era. is, vaccines still effective. live MI highly vaccinated county case counts high vaccine-evasion high. seeing parents worth risk spreading deadly disease go ahead. Personally wouldn't, I've never one needs room someone feel close, perspective different. What's solution? say fuck it, besides better judgment, everybody needs go travel abroad vacation? save tourism?

It's pandemic. something par war lot ways.  Florida  possible, factor high baseline Delta infections, take least 4+ weeks new variant make waves notable charts.

USA daily new cases 75k per day.

Say 10 infected people land USA.
With R 10 (high estimate)
100 week 2
1000 week 3
10000 week 4 

This virus super high R number even vaccinated immune populations… competing Delta still infecting people.

The R Delta closer 3 would mean takes 2 months variant pop charts.

So could spreading like wildfire, due underlying epidemic might notice epidemiological data really it’s way late.

That’s sequencing genomic data much important signals early variant.

But might see real effects Christmas, hitting big time exponential growth worst case scenarios come true. According lot epidemiologists follow Twitter, flight bans stage make countries banned less likely come forward suspected new variants. little epidemiological value flight bans. scrambling find now. time holidays.  isn’t Europe. It’s way worse I've kinda watching news month past year 2020 burned out. still this? fix yet? Alright, let know when. Back rock people supposed travel go tourism economy stays afloat?


Yes. late. Lockdowns brutal last resort measure, something wait see. Ah yes, psychopathic option. Yesterday South Africa positivity jumped 9% Hey all, let's completely isolate destroy UK trade tourism economy?

No? us South Africa then? Except houses breed fast need second one. 

The mistake opening travel without extensive monitoring quarantine. variant already found multiple cou tries, banning flights one cou try is, overall, meaningless. 

Smart countries would shut non-essential travel, enforce quarantines incoming people, initiate robust surveillance program search variant. Instead, things last year, reacting late limited manner. ""We'll begin discussions next week stepping checkpoints airports."" going count many people got COVID vaccination, never going move on. want know serious was. get sniffles ended ventilator? promise vaccines COVID going turned regular annual flu nuisance. took vaccine, never turned green. people saying test work 61 people Covid, 61 tested negative conclusion test failed 100%. rest us pointing know many positive tests flight. know it’s dangerous ability mutate quickly transmits easily. don’t know, per articles online right now, whether evade vaccine. [New York researchers found 30 mutations protein, called spike, surface coronavirus. spike protein chief target antibodies immune system produces fight Covid-19 infection. **So many mutations raised concerns Omicron’s spike might able evade antibodies produced either previous infection vaccine.** make sense reason Omicron spreading fast bypasses vaccines? 

What could possibly make new strain exponentially infectious Delta.

Only logical conclusion bypasses vaccine effectiveness spreads fast original covid strain one vaccinated. Thank response. I’m definitely going check doctor getting booster. I’d pick 1999 time machine. Spoiler alert: ALWAYS variants. 

Time live life, ignore hysteria panic media try cause realise never getting rid covid depending upon state are, one gives two shits militant it.  matter variant that's crazy me. can’t comment bowel movements Lol guess would good thing

You guess wrong. Covid transmissable less lethal SARS look works. statistics percent new cases Europe occurring vaccinated vs unvaccinated people? absolutely done mistakes pandemic surely even basic common sense advices absurd fear mongering point. hiding thing much part Japan. Pre-pandemic, I'd say demographics wearing masks ones likely insecure want hide behind mask - junior high/high schoolers, young women, etc. actually common hear old people complain younger people weirdly shy lacking confidence always wearing masks. buy fake negative test results easily african countries I'm sure enjoy paying bills sympathy God wish back 2007, early 20s partying every weekend without fear damn Covid absolutely must be. way 10% entire daily covid cases plane  Keep eye hospitalization rate percentage vaxxed. Many places similar situation - example country family finally got third doses reopening hard (after hiatus reached 5 months since second dose) despite wave hoping spend Christmas together. observe rething plans. Especially since live close airport probably already here. Equally important whether evade vaccine. Even make people sick original covid/delta, major trouble evade vaccine.

I even like think could made people sicker *and* could evade vaccine. would bad.   Things different countries like South Africa.  NYC gets first treat, courtesy care-free entry JFK. believe around Europe while? people feel like beeing cooped knows long. mean, long give next variant comes around? everyone run hide rely uber eats rest lives? people go earlier Netherlands require negative covid test board flight country (even transient travelers)?

Does Netherlands allow vaccinated travelers board flight country?

If vaccinaction requirement, many people tested positive vaccinated vs not?

Am missing something article full holes generally lack useful information around 61 positive tests? point think it’s safe assume it’s already every country gets lot air travel saw someone say vaccines turning new variants Twitter. Thats new level stupidity could extrapolating T-cells generated current vaccines should, theory, continue function strain. say, chance basing theory vs. proper data/study. Oh, that’s thought people shitting acting like world ending? guess people stupid.  Gonna take time things never (ooh, ooh)  tarmac 5 hours. Fool shame thee, fool twice shame me? weird things going Poland (deaths roof) Germany (cases roof) current wave seems impossible anything Delta - sequencing, would detected PCR thing seems make easy detect. Best news could get variant causes mild symptoms spreads like wildfire. would take Delta basically end pandemic. Sorry. consider seeing family ""dumb"" part. I'm talking people traveling sake tourists right now. hold judgment that. Maybe want see family? mother law going Norway Christmas see grandchildren seen 2 years now. Yes, everything black white. i've 5 shots 3 different mrna vaccins lmao know rings accurate- airlines require verifiable test result accredited lab/testing facility. absolutely concede *possible* someone could've, know, altered result somehow? holy shit, retribution person would face found lied travel- info, records, etc. travel first place. That's hell risk get charged felony-level crimes found out, cause bet absolutely follow initial tests found 61 previously negative people positive. 3–5 million severe cases annually, 650,000 respiratory-related deaths globally year. data better comparison  

table 2, eff. vs Covid-19 related mortality, 55-64 years old 

pfizer 92,7 
sputnik 96.7 
astrazeneca 90,8 
sinofarm 87,9  airplane cabins well ventilated flight, still disturbing. Agreed honestly make stuff up...if watching movie based last year happened would thinking yeah right if! business go on. nearly ones ones die anti vaxxers. free take chances rest us motor on. variant starts showing total breakthrough 10% morbidity higher might see total global lockdown again. I'm surprised many people seem understand least us heavily vaccinated areas.

So like 1% world... Yeah. sure say them. sympathy, what, people supposed travel go tourism economy stays afloat? Great, stop n stupid travel restrictions? help, variant already. Depends testing happening wife laugh loud store today noticed empty toilet paper shelves already. lol Except evidence countries ban list “hotspots”, even point origin. Likewise evidence Omicron capable jumping current vaccines, worse strain despite 24hr panic witnessed. South Africa first identify Omicron robust infectious disease research program (mostly HIV issue there), strain didn’t necessarily emerge there. Omicron appears already global. Best thing robust testing international travel hope vaccines job. Covid positive Omicron specifically? abundance caution. might say overabundance Even lab created super mutations vaccine responses dark ages didnt end ppl lol part 6 doc’s tweet.  flew SA US two days ago negative pcr required check flight get boarding pass. many people get false negative? fake test? Probably even high enough infectious.

You've described purpose rapid test. No. due respect incredibly obtuse disrespectful people going immense suffering loss happily minimizing glossing over. That’s I’m going say matter comments infuriating. new variant 30 mutations spike protein, that’s main thing that’s causing dumb question, epsilon instead omicron? COVID likely largest transfer wealth middle class rich recent history. (maybe except '08). seeing many small business failed first year, insane people still advocating return lockdowns.

Get vaccinated, wear masks, cross fingers. risk people weigh pros cons decide want do.

But telling vaccinated people need stay home like countries EU mind blowing. test positive, contagious. Haha always thought “I miss rains Africa”. Derp. states sequencing? really question best answered doctor. *Your* doctor, possible.  really large amount we're looking global statistics. There’s winning convincing permanent maskers like this. mask forever shame people don’t wear N100 masks alone park. believe letter Greek alphabet. good news is, US least long time, wear mask, folks really think twice it. covid, wore mask, totally different.

I continue wear mask planes, busses places exposed folks tight quarters.  send back beg Lmao literally reading posted. said reason travel “growing children.” Dying parents, spouses, etc suffice zoom call. continue acting like moral police comes peoples reasons travel, us don’t luxury lock home wait disappear. Fighting COVID public health. Alvaro Obregon. 🇲🇽 virologist epidemiologist. *over* 100%? obviously blanked UK banned last year, lol. original plague island. magically make valid, makes valid because... understand harmed.

Thus, quarantine. That’s bad presentation data. Expand area recalculate instead manipulating sensational headline. Alvaro Obregón Yup. it’s UK high probability already US too. right track. point viral RNA mutate. Sometimes impact anything sometimes makes virus less deadly less infectious. might go undetected quickly crossed strain interest.

The issue ones affect certain regions virus. example, affect site antibodies bind virus virus us. strains could ""beat"" vaccine.

[The site listing current strains concern (alpha, delta, omega) interest (lambda, mu), well Greek letter name yet they're monitoring (think like early monitoring system. know strains they're better worse).  No, deaths actually little less time last year. Current 7-day average 253, last year 301. peak 907 10th January 2021. Since number daily cases triple last year, death rate reduced third was. 

That said, still needs taken seriously many lives going lost action taken. NEED go another national lockdown. New York. better medical infrastructure NYC major travel hub. Also early symptoms may there, so.. later detection realise ""instituional trader"" means worked bank whos job monitor things. wouldn’t go back February 2020 literally money world. realise UK sequences lot right? idea circulating UK one realised till couple weeks South Africa sequenced bizarre say least.  almost like missed part ""Kent"" variant almost every country banning travel UK. I’m guessing you’ve yet lost parent? have, biggest regret didn’t get see one time, give one hug, share one meal them, etc. PRE COVID. One day South African travel ban already useless.

This probably already spreading like wildfire EU right now. Yes! installed one couple years ago, pandemic. They’re great cleaning. Americans really get idea bidets weird. 

You install regular toilet. 

Search “bidet attachment toilet”. people test positive allowed continue trips. sitting plane infected passengers, maybe wearing masks, tarmac 4 hours. before, now. Data protection laws weird Germany.
On one hand health database, hand Germay actively trying enforce chat surveillance politicans even pushing mandatory registration online forums full name. EU artists joke hear it. 

Quarantine going effect already passed border. would reduce risks next variant kept place. 

Since covid long lived surfaces, Pele need Quarantined, thus God's travel fairly easily proper planning. proof substantiate claim? I've heard stuff like happening delta wave too, without evidence. bought come new KN95 masks read this. going never-ending. *That* argument peddled Florida reason wear masks.  It’s got everywhere now. NY you’re vaccinated little worry about. COVID going away anytime soon; lot folks ready move on. unvaccinated live (or die from) consequences choices.

Get vaccine, wear mask needed, live life. large number mutations suggest originated someone comprised immune system unable clear infection. 
Therefore virus time within body adapt mutate. 

It's lots people getting it, long infection lasts someone too.

Sadly higher incidence HIV Africa.  Sorry, referring breakthrough cases. clear. 1. study yet peer reviewed.
2. occurred person infected within previous 6 months only. Past correlation strong.
3. Previous immunity + vaccine dose best. “They don’t understand” magically make travelling see valid. get interactivity elsewhere without travel involved. 

If you’re going travel need travel everyone, everyone except people young children they’re super special. Individually, heart disease cancer still killing people double rate corona. Where’s cheese burger vaccine? Thank information. Wow feel dumb finding myself. think check CDC website embarrassing. blame lack sleep. Thanks much! would good thing, that’s best case scenario I’ve got fingers crossed for. Luckily though it’s looking like vaccines still effective regardless. mean theoretically good thing. Natural selection tends send viruses “more contagious, less virulent” path. mutations along path would traveled. Sure, anything possible large number mutations meaningless. I’m going say it. thread doesn’t pass vibe chat. miss folks taking virus seriously Jan Feb 2020. [Think high number mutations studied know impactful, high number mutations studied appear likely non-coincidental (why 3 mutations within 5 adjacent amino acids..?) 

And rapid spread Gauteng.

No data hospitalization risk anything like though. LET'S GO Exactly. *Never* say ""L"" word. try ""Rollback"", planned beginning? refers *reducing* public gathering enclosed areas. 

And p.s.: average American citizen want either, unless visibility here: *massive* visibility. Every grocery store needs distribute pamphlet groceries it. Tents front entrance medical personnel least trained tracers talk transmission prevention. Posters public transportation, Ubers Lyfts, laundromats, etc. Mail campaigns postcards. got massively advertised. Got shots 2020 booster month ago. feel like going turn annual shot much like flu vaccine. misinterpreted “but Covid like flu!” comment, think Covid never fully going away, vaccine become regular part lives. Huh, wonder vaccination, literally got second shot Thursday, help this. would mind another shot. Ah shit, go again... Idk think, guy *gasp* 6 whole years experience thinks person knowledge. Maybe you’re wrong lol truth far know nothing IMO media jumping next big thing scare people about. 

but understand mutation came someone also AIDS like weird mix. 

this least people thinking again, know anything it. Whether not, least seem almost cartoon-villain level cruel indifference towards around them. Like fine, surrender possibility getting sick want -- situation, sure certain knowledge risk, could truly exercise one miniscule crumb consideration?

The reporter frames human failure can't really disagree. anecdotal admit, pass airport month ago wall-to-wall maskless people without apparent care world. One guys saw wearing mask actually... pulled could cough comfortably. Belgian one symptomatic unvaccinated 61 600 positive Corona flights back Netherlands.

I mean wtf? new variant, probably already everywhere.  state from? Texas quite well right per capita case rates lowest continental US second Florida. think you’d find there’s whole lot mask wearing going Florida either let people self determine find necessary travel

That's exactly did... Thanks yet, two vaccinated people never met somehow passed across hotel hallways.  people living alternate reality  literally say that. literally say ban travel I?

I'm glad charge interpreting written words.  bizarre reach He’s excellent, science good. explains new variant 500% competitive. [that'd one way go EU one country power, sit national governments.

As others said, quarantines ineffective tool security theatre point, variants already spreading would regardless airport quarantine (the EU big porous actually work, stop cross border trade Ireland, Dover, Turkey Morocco, quarantine level would consign Ireland UK worst food shortage since WW2?) point right even know locations currently highest prevalence Omicron we’ve looking day half. point could well common Netherlands South Africa (for example). Flight bans like purely theater. know, example, multiple cases Israel, least one Hong Kong. flight bans countries help slow spread… Rapid tests inaccurate. useful links. It’s different everyone. Covid, first dose fine. Second jab rough.  Stop spamming shitty meme every post It’s weird reporter calls unventilated room. airplane’s hvac system hepa filters operating entire time. Whether air tarmac. Depending aircraft would also adding fresh outside air supplementing O2 needed. Boeing 717 one first aware pull outside air. expect planes made last 20 years well. 

I frequent flier 23 years. Usually 100 flights per year. time stuck plane hvac system wasn’t functioning 757 defective auxiliary power system. engines turned off, sat waiting weather clear, open cabin doors let fresh air in. 

Outside system failure, air cleaner gate area boarding. doesn’t help much person directly front/behind/next infected, prevent entire plane infected. Growing children less likely understand person glowing box mom. Especially younger children. Growing children need interactivity, especially parent figures peers. Even things like bugs Vitaly important children's mental physical health grow up. 

While physical contact important adults, less vital wellbeing adults rationalize better. understand grown children can't hug them, present via phone. 

Either way, suggest 2 week quarantine travel, allow travelers determine legitimate need endure month quarantine (2 weeks; side) Ok great hobby moderator...and bc keeping discussion pure keep responding. Theres need talks this. LMAO yes true. past years shown bar game changing US fucking high love go developed world needs underwrite vaccination medical needs developing world, halfassed response developed world shown us anything, it’s aren’t even handling needs.

Yeah, isn’t developed world’s fault isn’t ‘developed vs developing’ world issue. South Africa enough vaccines government weak convince citizens take it, many citizens antivax resulting dismal 24% vaccination rate. contrary, India, way less developed South Africa, 75% population inoculated least one dose. 

What developed world governments citizens don’t take seriously? That’s them, US EU.  Lol know Xi wasnt used It’s one became dominant variant two weeks. took Delta 3 months become dominant variant levels seen omicron. early data? comment buzz lightyear cause shit went infinity beyond understanding easy contrary. Praying you. Hope feel better 🙏 already Bavaria. idea already USA. You’ve provided actual data sets assertions. sources. 

Amazing supposedly vaccinated friends beating odds getting knocked down. yet mention unvaccinated. 

Put data sets.  Slamming total travel ban eight countries isolating world *any* hard data could well end harm good. Travel bans crap. stupid thing everywhere already. Would probably help properly check certificates entering restaurants/cinema/events. show ID once, QR code scanned ever... seems rare. restaurants ask certificate even want see it. understand checked thoroughly. 
So course people find appealing fake certificate use one someone else. properly checked anyway, try it. :( sad. sit Reddit wondering wtf went wrong Media happy new variant emerged scare people.

That annoying people advocating permanent lockdown measures also happy. yeah. Everything closes 5pm. means go gym 7am 5pm, evening allowed. 😂 


What see busses going Germany party there. clubs Germany still opened Dutchies go there. Also dinner etc.  Schools gonna fun next week little early hospitalizations increased, though? usually see weeks later. thought safe start traveling again… I'm glad clarified secretly hoping logging Mars. people smoke don’t get lung cancer. Many do. else would know you’re alive Meh, let them. makes laugh run get tested get sick agree hospitalisation instead sticking guns taking livestock medication home. aired CNBC approximately 5:20am yesterday, November 26, 2021. variant was, yet, unnamed. watched live grateful CNBC put video website.

Pasi Pentinnen remarks early data suggests Omicron evades immunity vaccines, prior infection, even monoclonal antibodies.

With news landscape filled competing views Omicron, it’s belief Mr. Pentinnen speaking honestly certainly frankly. way would happen general fatality rate becomes 20% study quantity antibodies; quality. studies suggesting natural infection followed vaccination produces broader, mature range antibodies.  United Delta said Friday changing flight schedules SA. idea origin point far Johannesburg hold water.

While prevalence growing South Africa, travel ban halve rate spread essentially buy us one week week continues.

This idea getting upvotes. Limiting travel slow spread disease.  Yes continuing failed policy make difference time. /s feel bad Fauci. amount shit must shake head daily would mind boggling  Saying mean know won't. COVID brain? forget spike Europe week two good old Delta anyway. weird. winter. People enclosed seasonal effects communal diseases taking effect. Leave 24% vaccination rate downplay disaster What's deal? absolutely right people selfish, there's reason accuse falsely righteous. Maybe also make mandatory everyone refusing get think so, even two markers selected highly specific. also similar situations Alpha variant, cause much confusion regard. expert field though.  don’t slice. fat finger loaf. don’t think read much that. *possibly* survived *might* one many people asymptomatic, virus transmitted someone could totally screw over.

There’s still many questions answered around new variant though… isolate 1 weeks guess know soon enough. don’t understand. people assuming new variant worse delta? economy get big hit full lockdown. Restaurant still allowed deliver food takeaway. Also amateur (team) sports allowed 17:00. virus sleeping time. avoid many people meeting up. anyone else disoriented confused going past 2 days? seems weird confusing, without obvious reasons worried like back March 2020. admit zero trust governments PH officials handling pandemic whole ""You need mask anymore!! ... JK!"" rhetoric US summer, governments blocking travel Africa even though variant 110% already global. Like keep making disruptive failed mistakes OG virus, alpha, delta, one, going on? feel lost right now. important remember none Covid vaccines 100% efficient. one 90% efficient meet 10 infected persons without preventative measures likely catch it. Even meet one infected person, may unlucky infected yourself. idea downvoted. feel similarly. Like one thing know girl went high school fine, bored internet trying start shit. 

It's another thing entirely American doctors experimented poor fight back. Absolutely judge one group harder other. WHOOOSH  Yeah less travellers, smaller chance positive case escaping somehow requirements. Think way:

Let's say flu-like symptoms, at-home test shows positive go rapid test even PCR shows negative. go life thinking dont COVID tell friends say ""we'd better distance bit sure"". Would blame find bad behaviour? personally SA case, better safe sorry.  convenient ""new variant"" come holidays.  variant discovered Nov 11, probably arrived NYC Nov 12. data base slight distrust politicians on?

Need gesture vaguely state world right now? flights still leave NY? flu? Evolves every year. Yea don’t see family 2 years. biggie. 10 years' time, look back realise done anything scared virus. There’s inverse relationship vaccinated populations viral mutations disease…. people tested positive upon landing Netherlands given rapid test taking tested negative. base-pair belong us Never doubt Florida funds, get ones heated seats water. tushy thank you. know whether antibodies effective still, cells still work matters long-term immunity. Sorry South Africa, buying time scientists figure things. many people drying and/or hospitalized lethal variant? need get Reddit stop assuming three top posts day reflect actual life vaccine people.. rest life? thanks guys you. pushing everyone get vaccines

You mean vaccines they've pushing last year now? ones would prevented exactly type varient forming? ones would saved hundreds thousands, millions lives?

You're /r/Coronavirus. think going garner pity and/or sympathy anti-vaxxer here, leave. **YOU reason we're still mess.** actually kind rebellion workplace. Management wanted us come back answer *unanimously* no. I'm middle management, supervisor 1/3 people involved, pretty awkward position. love team death, they're amazing, course supported this, kind broke 17-year relationship boss. gone rails entirely mid-managers pretty much same. threw hands, told us SHE'LL still coming in, anyone ""actually wants here"" come too. We're developers, graphic designers, etc... jobs could moon. honestly think lonely work chance social. thing wondering. Landing wed 6 pm leave via train thursday 7 pm “vindication.” DeSantis house! Nothing weird it. Using 3 clamshells weird  daft is. 24% South Africans vaccinated. 24%. collectively absolutely part. see part said “**BEFORE COVID**, vaccines lucrative business unit pharma.” Infectious diseases never been. Why? Antibiotics (cheap) vaccines (cheap, preventative) typically cure infectious disease simply aren’t money-makers. yield profit, aren’t enormous like cancer drugs, heart disease, pain meds, etc. 

Switzerland global headquarters many huge pharma companies weren’t interested making vaccines (when covid first hit) bc **traditionally** aren’t profitable. OBVIOUSLY companies business profit.

Here article didn’t read explaining this. Pharma companies quick jump developing things like home-test kits (=profit) weren’t starting vaccine departments back bc vaccines don’t usually make long-term profit. COVID VACCINE MARKET LANDSCAPE COMPLETELY CHANGED since everyone needs one governments financing it. Traditionally, hasn’t case.

And funny think capitalism socialism sort arch-enemies favor one times. shows polar echo-chamber is. Waste lol 100% clear new variants come play. vaccine induced antibodies focus spike protein, natural immunity likely targets broader range features. 

So, spike protein changes, may quantity SARS COV 2 antibodies also quality (&amp;diversity). Remains seen. pick choose believe. plenty practice - cherry pick Bible. ...? Incivility? didnt say anything rude lol People don’t want half ass lockdown, either. Even compliant areas fed up. still pissing people off, without added benefit actually anything meaningful stop spread. 

It's shortsighted ineffective 400k deaths US.  gf another continent? suggest country continent might fine. SA Belgium Canada Brazil...this possible mid 20C.

But I'm seeing lot entitled tourism nothing personal relationships family however. Whimsical visits Paris US reward wfm successfully. can't know week discovery. far know, colds picked surfaces. airborne virus like one, good filtration key. course, isn’t fullproof I’m sure plenty people acquired Covid flying. Two close friends - COVID ICU nurse ER head resident- tell there's rhyme reason gets heavy responses based experience colleagues (because COVID patients notorious liars experience vaccine response there). THIS. Like feel WaterPik teeth, let’s try yer butt!!! Vancouver metro close 3 million- massive metro wouldn’t describe “not lot” Well brilliant revelation comes, encouraging unvaccinated get vaccinated seems like rational approach. Wheres Arrested development novelty account need them? Masks likely become regular thing I'm honestly okay with. rather inside outside, could something  casually hoping death 50 million people First case omicron early. need wait week two legitimate data point. cases covid mild though. think data make clear judgment severity yet. what's paper genome analysis. dont forget nothing flu $$$  stop giving shit personal uncomfortableness. We’re past that. finally, finally make tough ass decisions fucking stick them. Hmm part almost 2 years now, traveled back home country summer see family, parents coming visit xmas, fully vaxed, booster shot within next week children soon fully vaxed. done, part, screw that. Ok - people cautious. vast majority population aren’t elevated risk shouldn’t bend backwards. Fwiw, 90 year old grandmother boostered - family decided point protection, getting see family taking tiny risk better continually cloistering her.

What endgame here? vaccine widely available. can’t move goalposts again. 2 weeks number news outlets spouting Pfizer planned know needed “tweak” vaccine. That, could done ready 3 months needed. reporting, hard data I’ve seen yet. Viral load also huge amount it. things like norovirus, virus still spread weeks person recovered like vhs tape thats copied over, likely degrade time. think important remember spike protein limit many mutation unable interact host cells. mutates point can't interact human cells, can't cause human infection. 

The vaccines may less effective, can't imagine scenario like March 2020. is, unless unvaccinnated. formal mandates place right now. (federal government, state/city governments, military, airlines) largely worked compliance usually 95%+, sometimes close 99%.

The way got vaccines near 100% school related mandates time.

Mandates realistically enforceable it’s long term relationship deep check value sides. means schools, jobs, maybe certain government services. Travel one outlier could also enforce. That's pretty hands-off job imo, ok. work grocery store, im stressin Source? course adding people surrounding area actually makes Vancouver even less dense 5,500 ppl per square kilometer.  actually makes point Paris like Vancouver even stronger.   

The poster replied saying essentially Canada know France.  Vancouver dense city Canada id look inside city limits.  widen scope actually decreases. promise made retrospectively, long marketed silver bullet would guarantee return normal.

Infections among vaccinated still important because, since emergence delta, scientists politicians alike gaslighting public thinking getting vaccinated responsible choice stops spread. reality, there's plenty vaccinated individuals asymptomatic mild infections inadvertently contributing prolongation pandemic. 
 
I understand vaccines confer sterilizing immunity, everyone doubles doctor free time. Even common knowledge scientific circles, explicitly stated public beginning. also casts reasonable doubt necessity vaccine mandates, that's another story another day. 
 
I think important hold authorities accountable lack transparency putting political financial interests ahead public safety. earth flat, whole affair could've lot cleaner imo. several scientific papers followed COVID cases patients weak immune systems due various cancers, HIV, etc. could also organ transplant patient. cases last months. papers frequently show large numbers mutations like one patient.

An HIV patient origin suspected that’s probably common cause weak immune systems southern Africa. exactly Ive saying!! Thank you! variant scares me, government reactions it. said news is, theres new variant concern doing, id nervous freaked out.

They found variant tuesday. Flights borders closed. Emergency meeting who. Pfizer saying working vaccine tweaking one. 

Like feel know telling us. never reaction waves. always disjointed late. time find shutting things down. look good, I'm happy taking seriously. year half proactive aggresive? 

Idk dad says goverments health organizations worried happened delta. acting faster aggressively. Idk think, I'm waiting time pass info come out. Pretty soon they’ll change 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. think government pay everyone monthly regardless pandemic, yeah, especially help people survive financially curb virus otherwise continue run amuck planet. happened hotel quarantine Howard Springs? patients immune system creates strong enough response destroy virus, pass relatively whatever virus got unless replicating mutates within pass mutation.

In someone immunocompromised like HIV patient properly treated immune system stunted, produce antibodies fight infection enough.

You need swarm mass antibodies. infection sticks around continuously multiplying immune system still producing antibodies fight virus exists equilibrium. 

Then one virus particles evades specific antibody better chance begins winning, immune system produces slightly different antibody still enough. 

You become self selecting machine evolving virus much quicker 10 20 1000 normal people. Numbers course pulled bum, largely normal individual antibodies produce wins kills virus entirely leads many mutations probably none except spread even mutated version still original variant well may even pass mutation.

If infected months continuously fighting forcing self selection, ideal breeding environment virus go leaps bounds past past. contagious less lethal delta would good thing, no? milder strain taking would help weed bad strains, give people immunity illness. bad reacting slowly

So enforcing masks social distancing bad millions people dead? viruses spread easier cold climates. Dry air cold make people runny noses constantly touching/wiping spreading. people spend time indoors. see stomach bugs/colds/flus spread lot winter. Yes. Delta hit, world access vaccines. dont think anyone ""announce"" anything. slow fade 2023 summer time full effect worldwide vaccinations, anti virals boosters would taken effect. Hopefully point arbitrary shutdowns, restrictions longer norm world. Essentially rest world reach state US/UK/Scandinavia right sans masks.

An official end would announces ended like pandemics epidemics. given political nature pandemic Im holding breath that. think pandemic last rest life? interesting take. Mask dont work even says box Evading immunity misleading. Antibodies may less effective stopping it. However, variants, cells fight long-term, even literally 0 antibodies left.

Honestly, saying evades immunity simplies matter tremendously, either stupid fearmongering. Omicrons roll out!! Why? healthy 20 year old earth would take vaccine. chances dying covid minuscule much greater risk myocarditis lot people need know. someone whose vaccinated I’m concerned contracting mild case potentially spreading others, especially Christmas older relatives. different variant? Anything new strain? Double-vaxxed + booster meh, still wondering much longer gotta keep going ole shit kinda wish left /s see fire caused  Starting today, band BTS holding 4 concerts LA estimated total attendance 200k people, flying world. already, weekend. would wear mask. spend time away folks. get good pack n95s like 20 bucks amazon. Wear those, reuse fine. thank goodness fuaci it, like AIDS Ebola  I'd assume making assertion based genomic profile new variant rather going hard data. time tell much problem Omicron world. contagious? 
New York **fully** vaccinated 13,268,116 people, 
covering **72.4%** eligible population, 5 older... 
and **68.2%** state’s entire population. 
1,745,546 people received booster shot, 
covering 13.2% fully vaccinated people immunity.

Ngl, pleasantly unexpected. paranoid delay somehow reduce impact. Anyway try find evidence support thank replying  also half names wrong left majority variant lineages. exact thing happen Delta first broke?

I got booster today anyway I'm worried see anything otherwise. deal no????the measures taking taking human rights away Double dose, news correct. extend forever? really 'whoosh' situation unless /s comment. OP kind made clueless looking comment. give redditors benefit doubt anymore, there's much sillyness going world, especially reddit. vast majority scientific literature points natural immunity leading less infection, hospitalization, death.

I’m sure you’ve read studies Israel cited time. data yet. provide information fly atm. Let's hope they're truthful mask mandate Dutch airline KLM, operated  
flights South Africa, many passengers wear face coverings,  
said New York Times reporter Stephanie Nolen, aboard one  
planes. Passengers stuck airport tarmac four hours 
 sent swabbed, tweeted Nolen, later said tested negative.

This against. deaths realistically preventable, hunger poverty eliminated. Earth become Easter Island, everyone die, deaths preventable. Incompetent Should* Well, could say got vaccined vaccines recommended country. Idk whether government'll advise get vaccined one shot. I'm sure like they'll act yet.

Did guys right NY already get new news new shot beyond three ones already took? hahahahahaha.  
sure. course here. I'm sure already swirling around NYC like last time. kidding? stop boosting alarmist headlines devoid fact serve create doom fear? Please?

We evidence vaccines ineffective Omicron. None. evidence Omicron deadly previous variants. toddler daycare. result, get new cold every month, long he's there. line national averages. get COVID tested every time. never gotten positive result. 

There lots colds there! Question: person fully vaccinated (2 + booster), exposed/infected COVID-19, absolute PCR test show positive result?

I'm curious vaccinated means catch COVID-19, immune system react fast/powerful enough neutralize way likely allow sufficient virus load body detected tests.

I presume breakthrough cases result immune system performing well enough prevent infection, thus test picks virus presence, even asymptomatic. 

Appreciate insight/explanation. 

Thanks. New Zealand sequence every case mostly overnight results. Great post. Thank you. Could damn well originated living rooms US. Maybe, also maybe nobody English-speaking world really knows pronounce ""Xi"". *people* period South Africa unvaccinated tell much own. Oh no.... Well can't wait Omega variant... 98% deadly. point, discriminate vazzed uvaxxed.... isolating totally alone since got covid February 2020... I'm going 2 months fighting breathe, year able stay awake 3 hours constantly nursing mother headaches... going 2x2 months hellish vaccine symptoms, hide crazy ass... Covid, please mutate take care ""smart informed"" people... I'm done almost 2 years total isolation! “The new Omicron variant Coronavirus results MILD disease, WITHOUT prominent symptoms.” -Angelique Coetzee, chairwoman South African Medical Association.

My comment gets removed source Google it. quite. 61 600 tested positive COVID-19, variant.  trip Uk September 2020, it’s still hold :( Hong Kong identified 11 day incubation period (its delta back slow build up, might good immune response), could already everywhere, depending honest Hong Kong cases it’s super easy catch even symptoms appear vaccinated. always late. Governments start announcing new restrictions maybe week rush it. flu well? Young healthy people sometimes rarely die though greatest risk factor overweight age. Actually counterintuitive want symptomatic less deadly. variant infects everyone kills least spreads most, also provides us antibodies protect us less infectious variants. time know it, it’s late travel bans anything. Korea well general record high still probably good day Western countries. country like five deaths, eight seem like ""almost double."" sounds lot scarier might be... know someone return Egypt. way going near least 3 weeks. test negative airport? provide proof negative test ad recent 1-3 days? 

If latter, getting fake negative test travel thing people South Africa? Also UK much spread Delta rest EU. think EU single digits percentage spread already dominant variant UK cure bacteria. virus

Yea. Duh. We’re talking Infectious Diseases tho. bacterial viral. Antibiotics cure bacterial vaccines/anti-virals help cure viral. pharma medical industry umbrella term “INFECTIOUS DISEASE.” You’re clearly either industry. Infectious disease (ID) name business unit specialty infectious diseases (whether bacterial viral). 

Yea, ID sectors making enormous profits NOW. wasn’t case before, yet keep bringing last quarter lol. Many companies downsized ID business units bc weren’t making enough profit covid. OBVIOUSLY. Read article. 

Federal government taxes funded vaccines help private investors too. Pharma companies didn’t give shit vaccines bc never turned enough profit. would they?? It’s good business. 

What’s good global health doesn’t always align what’s lucrative pharma business — anything wrong that? necessarily. time socialism capitalism worked together bc good global health good business CASE. far seems case.  
The issue US \~60% fully vaccinated. [vaccine Trust one, I'm right you. never ever rest life want see white freezer trucks outside hospital matter.

PTSD norm us, free therapy yeah stuff never really goes away.

Stay positive possible! We've learned lot last years, sure. believe first case detected South Africa far back November 11th. long bumping around point, happened right sort test one individual? many people passed around November 11th weekend? many flights Joburg since November 11th? 
 
First detected cases announced last 24 hours England, Italy, Belgium Germany.

And I'm pretty sure others also reduce contacts magnitude like last winter. Vaccines Still Likely Work

In Hongkong total 8 Omicron cases detected. 7 fully vaccinated (at least two Biontech). work. one probably need update. 90 days Pfizer put general, others claim 60 would possible.   could possibly go wrong 🙄
These examples stupidity directly effect intelligent people trying end Virus 😞🤨 lost savings college. You’re spoiling kids. Either get scholarships go military earn college, gonna pay kids.

Granted actual flying take ground contact account. Also imagine long haul flights lot passengers wear masks correctly good part journey.  Either way, got enough DNA points huge mutation  Omicron probably europe now. quite- cases basically non-existent SA. developed inside immunocompromised individual (likely HIV) **long** time. spread. 

Read it. It’s pretty interesting. full saying?   95% eligible populations Melbourne Sydney vaccinated. Same. Sucks able sleep left side, still happy got it. I'm Europe. rarely see people wearing masks more, people company traveling cities business, there's expectation showing office, every day least times week sometimes mandatory person meetings. Large % fully vaccinated heading towards ATH levels daily cases. reason stop taking seriously imo. 

But people sick guess, desperate things go back way were.  Man's Sky shown pre release incredible. 

No Man's Sky release WTF happened this???

No Man's Sky currently even better shown pre release. Especially VR. 

I blame Sony Hello Games. true.  tested negative released. thing happened traveler Hong Kong days ago, also Johannesburg.

As hub, busiest airport Africa, many dozens flights going world, see pockets appearing everywhere. 100-200 international flights day 25k passengers day. Give days infected develop numbers globally skyrocket. think few;

- Something went wrong second testing passengers, eg. most/all cases false positives
- South African infection rates start/keep going up, eg. Omicron might outcompeted Delta South African context, actually spreading fast 'just' superspreader event we're overanalyzing due low overall rate infection South Africa
- sequencing shows high relative prevalence Omicron South Africa fluke due low rate testing there, eg. bad luck Omicron cases selected tested (This might already quite impossible, seems like latest South Africa SGTF PCR assays seems like good proxy rates failures looking pretty scary - 50% specimens last days; source: Current vaccines work really well Omicron two people fully vaccinated cases Hong Kong unlucky ones Every single test ? call bullshit. 

Not enough tests case, rapid home tests collected tested ? updates quoted hours initial article created. agree tone tempered since then. reporter tested negative jumped flight Canada. best chance effective protection vaccination. don’t think much doubt that. 

Oh there's doubt, reasonable doubt. Well Germany Czech Republic, per Guardian. So, yeah, everywhere. Cross fingers highly contagious, virulent. virologist delved deep enough science understand fully, maybe someone smarter tell I'm thinking right:

Does high number mutations necessarily mean much sounds paper? surface makes sense varied virus is, challenging catch/stop vaccine. also possibility useless mutations? ones really connected overall fitness virus? 

Think race car example virus parts ""mutate"". tweak aerodynamic, adjust tire pressure better grip. good ""mutations"" make better track. fuzzy dice hanging rearview mirror would ""mutation"" well clearly much overall abilities track. There’s indication point that’s going happen. Breathe.   least know I'm crazy, missing super-secret bidet operation method something! Thank you! ""OK, OK, let's skip Nu go Xi...""

""Sir, Chinese phone""

""I'm announcing today new variant concern officially called Omicron"" Could far transmissable time far less lethal/sickening, guess would good thing. Republicans showed us choice. go thru might agree   Makes one wonder many cases haven’t detected. everyone quarantine airport get test results days? seems highly inefficient. Right. kill get tbh Survey suggests 100% ass wear one indefinitely others stupid irresponsible. kinda make good point, may spotting people getting pcr tests travelling. day day uk get think covid stuck airplane ventilation 12+ hours makings superspreader event. get needed quarantine find better way this?  Agreed. clear trying optimistic admit antibodies likely effective. me, that's saying vaccine's protection going get hit hard. Regardless vaccine vaccine, death unlikely someone age. care likely infected get infected likely transmit people parents. Antibody protection major part question. course parents vaccinated, get protection severe disease that's important too. 

Until numbers, assume people like nyt trying calm investors spinning information positively possible. Nobody knows anybody says know lying. discovered Tuesday top that, South Africa best epidemology teams there. disease prevention infrastructure FAR outpaces U.S. trust guy trust politican U.S this. article makes Ron DeSantis 2.0 People really think way Americans lived 1950-1999 normal lol two different flights Netherlands. Assume everywhere now, data yet. Neutral mutations affect fitness usually weeded natural selection, yeah there’s possibility useless mutations ‘hitchhiking’.   Fake proof verification probably It’s probably big countries already don’t even know yet  strain detected/reacts differently tests

This one would unlikely bolster sensitivity tests, already low, rather decreasing further. Agree points though. thinking two years almost. Netherlands 61 two flights, rest gets walk, potential virus show days. 

These flights already need negative test get on, really shows solid system is. That's relieving bit. seems Omicron already around outside Africa, could either mean... 


\- variant can't outcompete Delta.

\- incubation period longer Delta. 


Am guessing correct? name james. he. Stay safe Germans! Stay safe! Please beg you. Wear mask! careful! could anywhere! okay? fail see relevence response context comment made? getting feeling reading lot like pics restaurant story Australia somewhere. Got ton cases, country freaks or, find many people connected parties admit first mean corporate oligarchy really think hand public policy? consulted? reason travel bans set way gives airlines option continue travel. 

This whole pandemic shown poor neoliberalism managing crises. airlines state owned matter needed shut outside providing work people able to. considering extra manufacturing capacity needed could absolutely find them. least Keynesian influenced politicians balls actually use wartime production act new deal something. Good thing Biden said he’s going take care loans! /s Well see happened? wear mask protection rare event (covid mutation) happens somewhere else world…. Covid protocols place based direct risk illness chance mutation. Yes headlines. slight variation, something watch normal coronviruses. Also nothing vaccinated US countries using good vaccines worry about. mRna vaccines still effective, unvaccinated...they worry refuse vaccinate thier problem. article factually incorrect? call aspect out.

I think waltzed Matilda around sentence response. never know facts details this…….too many variables. Period. Bottom line - dam virus still us people world denial fighting vaccines “freedom”. Oh, history pandemic rich….  misspoke, meant herd immunity RS virus weak covid restrictions (Source: Swedish Public Health Authority ) someone living Johannesburg would say I've seen appears people turning vaccinate. I'm familiar many antivax social circle, say majority people know vaccinated. Flying vacation something rich people do. course wonders you. insane luxury enjoy. mean, breakthrough cases exactly rare Delta either. course, international travel related cases skew towards vaccinated, since overwhelming majority vaccinated. piece missing WA event one variant. Delta well-seeded everywhere SA, super-spreader events would probably spreading variants. I’m sure COVID-19 ever subside. fear may world now. may better. think looks like it’s wildly transmittable, idea serious is. No. Just... no. Please stop. world governments COVID variant conspiracy control population. fucking pandemic, features virus behaves like many viruses, mutates lot people ignorant refuse vaccination, get sick, spread more.

Now get new fun variant mutation could possibly highly contagious prior showing test. 

In words, ignorant minority us refusing vaccination cause 'mUh rIgHtS' causing spread mutate further. one faking fucking ""certificates"", want travel, see loved ones, get past species. 

And maybe move dark age celebrated stupidity. Get booster shots 

\*laughs order cry Irish booster policy\* magically 60 people got infected nowhere ten hour flight? I'm buying that.

Something add here. saying 50 million people died? sounds like lot me. I've seen, I'm pretty sure detected like within last week. almost bad practice report something new basically informatiom share. Oz water 30years anyway ... Wait days. high chance Omicron already Turkey? mean, Belgian unvaxxed person travelled via İstanbul. likely Omicron spread Turkey? kidding. ICU Nurse awesome. we’ve steroids that’s treatment. Nothing else worked. Getting one treatment means others way, actually better hoping proning. Tbh I’ve seen many asians wearing masks public COVID.  Starscream twat, name forgotten dignity maintained (even improved).

Galvatron cool too. Unicron ate motherfucking planets.

The sharkticons funny hell.

Spare mockery justice ""Developed country"".... behind, rich, maybe, smart, heck no. push boosters going change definition travel soon, opinion. Fully vaxxed mean 3 dosed instead 2 like me.

I see Canada boosters anytime soon, politicians playing roulette life, I'm going get US I'm allowed travel again. immune system weaken like implying people infecting viruses. normal year, get sick 2 3 times. body fight 2nd 3rd sickness better got sick something else 1st time. normal person probably consumes enough dirt bacteria licking lips keep immune system working. body constantly fighting sorts germs bacteria. feed immune system couple random viruses year inorder work lol. SA mostly unvaccinated hit hard regardless seriously posting dreck Guardian scraped Twitter accounts NYT reporters? Stop shit. useless. still leave wet ass. drying? No, quick tests (not self tests) valid too. notoriously unreliable. That's zombie apocalypse started used before.

[The Omega Steve P. Vincent understand sentiment, seeing there’s non-negligible probability variant didn’t even originate South Africa, better genetic surveillance places ever lift mask mandates aside schools? know 91 never option wear one literally get international flights even thing right now? finds hot tho Really wish upvoted ‘omg doomsday’ comments evidence. annoying COVID worked variants worked, course one work. think it. following scientists sequencing this?

They've changed. That’s rude. 

You’re absolute idiot. That’s rude.  Shit.    Current evidence suggests vaccines work pretty well them, reported similar levels antibodies compared people chemo. However, solid organ transplant recipients harder time mounting antibody response, probably require 4th dose. Bars clubs dangerous places spread - high density, poorly ventilated, shouting / singing people often spend lot time there. Closing early reduces time part. indicates variant circulation lot longer couple days/weeks. omega mean ""the end""? That's guess. Including usual measures done?
I really heard anything exercise, good shape, get vaccines, hand wash, social distance etc.

Anything else done general immune system boost? Also, vaccines affect immune system general (as opposed targeting specific virus)? provide general boost?  Nice know folks what's horizon. travel 5 different countries within 4 hours live. 5 quite different Covid measures place.

And one countries Germany different Covid rules various states (Bundesland, Germany federal Republic). Get Africa vaccinated NOW.  think discussion previously infected people able travel, attend concerts, go restaurants, etc they’re “immune” vaccinated people. here. think we'll fine though. least us heavily vaccinated areas.

No toilet paper panic time around, k guys? That's vibe getting news.

Do know evidence yet hospitalization death rates omicron? weak new know exactly? naming omicron.. sounds dumb Member anti vaxxers said 'government' come new strains scare us? Pepperidge Farm also remembers telling anti vaxxers that's viruses get vaccine! Source last bit? would imagine still regular surveillance variants, would surprised currently causing spike undetected, even sequencing delays. Yes, 1 10 positive, maybe pathanogenic. sad thing variant already determined many countries even several cases, little nothing known yet. forget again, we're there? possibility vaccine escape scares most. Plague Inc “Victory Lap” run  Read initially ""contrail."" suppose that's wrong, way. think public information concerning enough justify it, secret knowledge needed. looking something almost certainly contagious Delta almost certainly degree immune escape. think reasonable expectation point month world might look like Delta took India.   would never recommend rapid antigen tests asymptomatic patients high suspicion exposure. need high sensitivity PCR. Antigen tests good enough 1) patient symptomatic there's low chance false negative 2) low suspicion exposure illness need excuse get flight low-risk travellers. study issue LA Times article preprint peer reviewed either.

Can disregard well? California New York boost 6 months second shot. actually going ask, names them? originated? read concerns effective need time data really - give least month That’s absurd comparison think so. I'm reading article go! cat bag. hope vaccines offer least protection. Also skipped nu discount Michigan. like number one apparently. Detroit Metro brings lot international flights. Kinda makes wonder spike partly big O....not good way.....  Exactly, could actually good thing. less severe variant out-compete Delta. hope right man 😞 I'm argue you. Thanks, hear that. I'll try stick it.  Patent rights medical industry set prevent poor countries make medication, prevent huge corporations stealing medications companies used billions developing. Africa specific fewer vaccines rest world, that’s true, parents lifted, sure additional vaccines produced finite amount raw material, equipment manpower produce vaccines. Nine months since second vaccine shot. Interesting. I'll waiting science eagerly see omnicrom stacks boosted person imagined progressed species since days witch burnings. Turns we're still same. people two Pfizer shots Covid? I’m arguing transmissible is. I’m saying there’s clearly something wrong data. 

There’s way variant spread across entire continent caused single (potential) outbreak. 

How transmissible doesn’t matter. could transmissible virus ever exist, would possible.

Start exercising, eating well, stop obese. still confirmed yet. countries make pay quarantine hotel, i'd take look that. International travel risky. I'd also look incidence 3 countries testing (and avaccination) regime low testing might fake low incidence. Ministry foreign affairs risk assessment. 

Netherlands butchered handling incoming african passengers, one unventilated room, barely anyone masks waiting hours, least every 10th came positive. short, western countries overburdened 2 years pandemic test people smh.  think both. So, want rain parade anything live ""blue"" major US city would say mask usage maybe 15-20% May. that's Delta (too soon really tell Omicron going move needle). Very, masks vax rate high. Bars restaurants packed, live music back full capacity etc. Cases still low relative areas. actually suggesting 80-85% population live sociopathic tendencies, could perhaps wearing mask normal, natural behavior people made risk assessment based age, vaccination status, etc. decided benefits wearing one outweigh danger? guess usage low live probably nearly nil places USA. South African health officials already said variant shown mild symptoms without loss taste smell. according Angelique Coetzee, board member South African Medical Association.

We going see millions dead this. hysteria make prediction. Whereas wide range antibody titers response infection SARS-CoV-2, completion primary vaccine series, especially mRNA vaccines, typically leads consistent higher-titer initial antibody response. ever Europe? US place Ah Sweden lite Yep. Michiganders coming we've first snowfalls. seeing one hot spots country....... Merry Christmas! Definitely already US. Ok, gave two headlines last 24 hours. Since difficult direct link feel like Sandy Hook true turning point America respect regard (or lack thereof) life. Yes, realise Sandy Hook school shooting; pandemic. it’s essence situation feel applicable. Journalist Dan Hodges’ quote resonates: retrospect Sandy Hook marked end US gun control debate. America decided killing children bearable, over. Thanks  And, add- something debated among LEGIT experts. nearly black white making be.  might turn tree though. Florida test it. See, covid here!! Even then... could easily even originated South Africa, detected first. much worse we've already seen. Would also promote younger people get vaccinated saw coworkers get hospitalized die. Yeah get it. Getting paranoid know disclosed.. Surely enough reason close borders Israel high booster rate unless turns lethal Exactly this. Reading this, apply US citizens permanent residents, makes even useless. talking transmission point, severity. narrative, narrative head South African Medical Association's narrative. Fact bit early say though. might confirm might also close contacts travelers. case five Italy. basically Spanish flu stopped killing people? 

It turned flu now. said everyone hospitalized asymptomatic.

Do need Google asymptomatic means? Gotta act supplies last Vax Thanos Okay sure lol wonder Omicron anything recent spike COVID Austria. We're already couple days late anything meaningful towards prevention. hope vaccine helps variant continue personal procedures. damn many people country give af we're pretty much screwed. Amen haha exactly governments already losing minds it? Based know far news reports spreading seems highly transmissible.

But know pretty much nothing virulence (how sick makes people) relative strains. necessarily, scenario described would true rate vaccination severity disease demographics. 

A possible alternative scenario vaccinated folks 70 could still higher risk severe disease unvaccinated people 35. vaccinated younger folks basically risk severe disease. older population, could end relatively high number vaccinated individuals hospital, vaccine still quite effective preventing severe disease. get saying, new variant bad enough warrant additional shutdowns, means evades vaccines ""having done part"" enough. virus gives effs tired are. I'm gonna tell live, thing kill 1M+ time move place without restrictions peril.

Hopefully come that, know January. I'll wager guess much difficult hold someone test negative test positive even makes sense hold them. Narrator: didn't. 10% cases sequenced UK $800! That’s like TWO firstborns think first time made immune second time fluke. Bruh gotta tempt fate like that.

Watch shit turns everyone COVID-zombies inherit Earth. probably minimal contact door, any, people. probably one better people-free jobs! worked keep delta! /s 

In seriousness, variant emerged weeks months ago, spreading around world since then. We're noticing now. already widespread. things matter disease severity vaccine efficacy. think they're referring illnesses, cold flu. I’d surprised already coward screaming put everyone lockdown… I'm cautious anyways. that's smart thing do. honestly, better perpetually dead. ""no excuse""

Covid isn’t known mutating less deadly. Delta proved that. mutations may less deadly beat Delta. hope turns less deadly/not factor… need proactive instead reactive. 

Saying look cases data proof it’s much mild bizarre. UNLESS actually access data general public? possible, however yet known us likely known making decisions. could simply unverified data, waiting verification. Could also mean data drawing incomplete, sufficient… know sure exercise extreme caution. know it’s like pretend won’t effect, could different reacted differently. two people Hong Kong caught omicron double vaccinated Pfizer.

No... one many articles read past 24 hours, read people hospitalized variant SA. true. mean implication vaccines effective variant. scenario would expect representative population. mean total immune escape. early statistics seem show vaccines working enough keep people hospital now. point. talking obese people.

It's 27th right Saratoga Glens Falls Hospitals full covid cases right now. That's another week get extra help, matter Covid Vanilla, Delta, Omicron.

But fuck we're full Thanksgiving turkey already bought shit right? Right. cares wellbeing neighbors. Oh wow. know that. Thanks. Considering 4-8 day incubation period (can two weeks longer) COVID-19 many probably move onto develop symptoms. know. Even whales mammals live ocean get coronaviruses may get COVID-19 point. circulate among mammals foreseeable future. COVID variants existed well 50 million years humans going eradicate years trying.

Unfortunately many people refuse get vaccinated even available, pharmaceutical companies want share trade secrets help countries produce effective vaccines would save millions lives, global shortage supplies needed produce vaccines 7+ billion people. like trying stop global warming...we can't it...80 percent global warming natural 20 percent possible humans control. similar waging war middle east unwinnable...we done COVID. mean try can't stop inevitable. craziest part knowledge _May 2021_, yet _nothing_ [a similar scenario August 2021 led New Zealand's major delta outbreak still recovered from. How? never ending demands lockdowns restrictions every time variant pops up, get better.  vaccines supposed give us lives back continued mandates NPIs sustainable long run without turning powderkeg. 

I'm concerned kids' future world subordinated *everything* trying control statistically-mild contagious upper respiratory virus that's de-fanged vaccination.  We've lost nearly 2 years childhood this, turning forever war. 

We struggled whether even bother getting vaccinated give lives back. end made start series earlier month, they're pissed they'll still wear masks school day. Two days illness would consider moderate downside. people make discussions bear mind decisions effect others. market reaction omicron significantly risk compared variant far, including Delta take shit work feel like I'm downgrading, flying coach. Per day. definitely cases tested. pay tests one PCR test costs 20% monthly minimum wage.  people refuse anything help, even likely happen. However feel best.  Unknown, take weeks months determine Inject veins! Honestly man, I've felt bleak today I'm desperate good news US. frustrated see. keep wearing mask. I'm vaccinated young... get stares occasional comments. So, approach actually ""tried"" much Africa, right? (Not matter policy, due poverty) little access vaccines ability use quarantines. look like it'll change anytime soon. basically say do.

So right, we'll see Africa quite well vs Covid compared West (and Far East) coming years. interesting see plays out, though hard get good data Africa. 100% population US got vaccinated first available, would still high prevalence COVID population domestically abroad. Less deaths would likely result, COVID would still widespread, particularly delta variant dominant variant.  Lrrr ruler omicron persei 8, want invade earth again!!! don’t see article. ever searched Manchester. from? I'm flashbacks similar conversations Reddit February 2020 trying figure happening high numbers positives recent air travellers.

I suppose, there's one thing learned then, started yesterday. happening week two least already. probably hundreds thousands cases already, that's one airport.

The good news, though, happening no-one noticed anything vs. normal Covid cases, new variant may much transmissible Delta all. Either Netherlands worse monitoring South Africa, actually quite possible. Yeah, go proper order?

Ν, Ξ, Ο

They skipped 2. overly optimistic might land end Greek alphabet quite fast, quite fast we'll learn pronounce Thai consonants. Guys death rate new COVID varient?

I dont understand arguments, known long time vaccinated peoples spread virus too.
And vaccinated far less restriction, enterily possible wave contagions majority vaccinated peoples.

Disproportionate IMO probably 6 month supply food, minus produce. grew blizzard country, live covid-infested hurricane territory (FL). Seemed like reasonable thing do. well nightclub accept tested problem.

we start learn live it, last variant.
in six another one. banned. Ironic actually worked strain. Closing borderd late could help, learned important thing proactive would mean detect stop every cluster new variant imposing strict lockdowns restrictions, that's going happen country(Italy) many Yes no. Yes happen catch next couple months. drug companies ready create new vaccines. Yes take months develop them. aliens understood divide conquer, almost definitely would happen.   Lol. prefer interpretive spelling. Probably rapid antigen tests, don’t cost much. well known miss half true positives. son rapid PCR test work, $200. Wait didn’t present Negative PCR test board? take one every time took flight.

What’s point then? 🙁  Agree, another thing finance poorer nations vaccinated going stop. expected hear otherwise, we're seeing power mRNA vaccine here. always adapt formula better protect variant (at time writing, unlikely) situation there's need to. 

the formula tweakable easily thing safety profile/testing take time, lot time. remember one friends annoyed written terribly inaccurate obituary one family members, believe happens fairly often many papers, since often write obituaries many years ahead time slow work days. got Texas living Europe.

So yeah NY government responsible bunch vaccine fear good news, still hope vaccines boosters updated Omnicron. update Delta? Australia also amazing compared US. could possibly go wrong?  pass test trigonometry.   Also, last months, markets pricing idea we're getting close end pandemic.

If make people get vaccine, I'll repeat ad nauseam. 
But honest civic aspect important : getting vaccine limits capacity virus incubate potentially mutate get it, seriously impedes possibility infecting anyone else. Anecdotally, four double vaxxed people know caught mild covid tested positive LFTs. 100% anecdote rather misleading. mine, that's thing anecdotes sort stuff.

This tweet initially pessimistic thread indicates previous infection + 1 vaccine works, you’d hope infection + 2/3 vaccines would also prevent severe disease. Don’t think it’s going stop catching though. find mind boggling self proclaimed religious individuals refuse get vaccinated even though pope prominent leaders almost every religion repeatedly encouraged members get COVID vaccine. truly believed God would think would listen religious leaders even listen scientists, healthcare workers, political leaders, etc. possible new Omikron variant transmissible, lesser symptoms?

i dont speak dutch even understand TWO! flights. 600 passengers one plane unrealistic Even then, expect 10% test positive, that's crazy high. I'm doubting accuracy Dutch end. actually watched interview linked, thing says travel bans unlikely effective. one claims going stop spread, slow slightly. go full circle beta again. Always been. self test accept?  thanks.

Could global scale everyone airborne virus since would probably put hospitals ER world wider max capacity beyond full global pandemic plus immune compromised factor know, 10% passengers two flights tested positive, give us much confidence well testing country first place. testing effectively, can't confident extent spread variants SA.   Exactly!!! Bill Gates lobbied third world countries would able produce generics.

Now Pfizer life saving pill.

Fuck Bill Gates Pfizer. mean, take two seconds look editorialized headlines upvoted here.

""It's coming."" ""Markets tumble 'worst-ever' covid strain."" ## hold beer! - omicron That’s quote zero non anecdotal data. Austria hospitals overwhelmed, surgery rooms empty surgieries get delayed enough space ICU. awfully optimistic response smallpox outbreak. ""It's chicken pox!"" [but US less testing countries quite bit (by big part tracking problem here) age people underlying conditions?

Africa young compared rest world people tend morbidly obese.

It probably weeks know actual implications variant are.   modern day vaccines come w patch updates????? I'm 50 yr old sci fi fan, never would've imagined one.


Tbf, never would've imagined Q idiocy, either. Unfortunately, banning travel indefinitely practical solution. 98% one dose, 88% two doses, 30% three doses. believe almost inactivated vaccines. Every vaccine really works. preprint completed peer review Yeahhh subsides. Appears that’s going never German app allows export QR code via PDF file. use really de-activate sceenshots ... Hummm HIV 2021 death sentence. it’s early days. think still “anecdotal reports” phase. Governments buying time minimizing starting numbers travel bans. Exponential growth arrive soon enough. Even delaying hockey stick couple weeks save tens thousands lives line. 

Find companies supply chain identifying, sequencing, contributing rapid response variants. That’s going handling future. It’s way. It’s pretty safe bet companies remain solvent even things get tough again. IIRC cluster school, much younger people, probability severe illness probably even lower. Germany 68.4% fully vaccinated, 71.1% least first dose. (Source: Corona-Warn App)

I don’t know stats Poland, Germany isn’t considered country lower vaccination rate.  right. nothing protect eat deaths come. great start point. Strap folks  read correctly? median age participants 43? experts open record saying. Dont worry football helping well 6000 home fans derby game 2 weeks ago another 1500 away covid spreading like wildfire though football So, mRNA vaccines, almost point soon identify changes spike proteins, tweak vaccines target new changes? awesome get point local pharmacies small batch create supply mRNA code sent via email health departments. Good news


Omricon 500x transmissable just...how would possible? Drama excitement. 

We don’t know enough yet. Omicron discovered 4 days ago, drama excitement wins. “When danger doubt; run circles, scream, shout.” sounds like vindictiveness actually ending pandemic. Withholding viral cure pill people refused get vaccine feels nice, counterproductive people getting vaccine. excuse get three shots, even people covid two shots already.

I got good excuse.

Have invited get yet. Panic stations better lock everything even though doesn’t help whatsoever data referring to?  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

“Hong Kong omicron hotel” 

Your search terms, SA traveler seemingly infected Canadian Traveler quarantine hotel due valved mask (why permit valved mask quarantine hotel beyond me, enough cut transmission use there’s cloth mask mandate, truest respirator). understand it, transmission time x concentration thing. Wearing masks reduces concentration viral particles air. Less people would infected someone it. Ah thank you! Agreed Dip chicken nuggets frosty. even use QR code? Store link vaccination status ID card let read via NFC. guarantees ""eye check"" simple copy done. make difference. said *only* way get 90% unvaccinated die *unfortunately* happen quick enough. transmissible. seemingly following stages last big pandemic Spanish flu early 20th century knowledge. First wave bad (Alpha). Second wave really bad war everything else. (Delta us) virus slowly burned out. 

This dumb brain assuming happening new variant, viruses want die either, killing host bad it. best viruses ones easily go one another without harming host, like common cold. people mild symptoms covid variants. concern around fact displaced Delta faster Delta displaced dominant variant it. mutations expected make existing antibody treatments much less effective (supposedly AZ's treatment may affect much though?). reasons, may much infectious vaccinated people. think finally spooked people young healthy people seemed hospitalized succumbed it. Plus rate unvaxxed people hospitalized dying difficult ignore. So, *I trust immune system* longer seemed like great excuse.  

I doubts Omicron effect mild early reports suggesting might be. fact mild, might actually opposite effect. Anti-vax people backwards ways justifying denialism. know, otherwise makes sense. like Southern Africans infected. one said contain it, spread slowed give us time get information

 Nothing fundamentally changes, get vaccinated

 


We know yet. reasons believe vaccines could less effective omicron. That's Pfizer moderna working new boosters tailored variant, abundance caution.   Maybe will, maybe won't. meantime, remains overwhelming upside getting vaccinated. That's ges saying. He's saying hes CONCERNED POSSIBILITY happening, there's difference. think fatality rate covid is? I'll give clue: 100%

What *will* happen catch virus (most probably already), 98-99% die develop similar immunity vaccinated population. Well.....crap. thought vaccinated require test? Typically that's either sample stored collected properly early enough infection viral load high enough detected yet. time symptoms enough virus system/sample assay detect COVID still wipe twice dry off, comes back clean vast majority time, rare occasion missed something (only ever tiny spot), turn taken care seconds. water pressure plenty strong enough wash poo away. never turn 50% (more would pretty painful). Proud number vaccines we’ve provided rest world. fuck lot nice see. traveler either caught Mozambique November 11, traveler caught Italy means older cases Italy. Here’s thing: watching Italy one fastest countries report sequences sampling. would hard Omicron go unnoticed Italy long.

Now could spreading months, could spreading quickly. recent case jumps Gauteng Province suggest latter. rare considered trigger might something else vaccine? Due many people getting shots, odds random coincidences like high. Italian man 2 vaccine doses mild symptoms. good news vaccine efficacy severe disease. talk Aaron Rodgers’ medical team. sussed way back. I’m sure agree. 

This virus spread South Africa Egypt enough infect random visitors continents. don’t care transmissible is, that’s takes month happen. think doubling times many doubles you’d virus spread across entire continent. 

And think widespread would random countries visitors come contact it. don’t see happening month. Israel analysis BNT162b2

Among 2.5 million vaccinated HCO members 16 years age older, 54 cases met criteria myocarditis. estimated incidence per 100,000 persons received least one dose vaccine 2.13 cases (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56 2.70). highest incidence myocarditis (10.69 cases per 100,000 persons; 95% CI, 6.93 14.46) reported male patients ages 16 29 years. total 76% cases myocarditis described mild 22% intermediate; 1 case associated cardiogenic shock. median follow-up 83 days onset myocarditis, 1 patient readmitted hospital, 1 died unknown cause discharge. 14 patients left ventricular dysfunction echocardiography admission, 10 still dysfunction time hospital discharge. patients, 5 underwent subsequent testing revealed normal heart function. don’t understand think alternative be. telling us shows new country? hide information? want scientists tell anybody find it? want governments tell anybody? 

Like alternative want? Yea probs. think wishing quick death 50 million people valid opinion. think ashamed opinion. positive case China again, 

what part? Thanks reply! mean transient? 

Do think worth asking mix match vaccines? Pfizer:""We'll roll new vaccine within 100 days""

Vaccinated:""I got ear infection last time got vaccine""

Unvaccinated:""What tell you""

We're screwed feel like I’ve read November 11th lot. people contracted variant plane together point, we’re airport? Lead Paragraphs:

After overnight genome sequencing, UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) confirmed two cases COVID-19 mutations consistent B.1.1.529 identified UK.

In addition, line updated advice UKHSA, 4am Sunday Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia Angola added travel red list. Travellers returned four countries last 10 days must isolate get PCR test. UKHSA following recent arrivals countries. us vaccinated folks, definitely yes. media claiming one originated Africa, stereo typically anti-vaxers fear things Africa depends long contagious become symptomatic. priority would hope means mandated law jail time. yes.  rate looking for, rates long term effects COVID infection significant. also infectious two days symptoms appear, time realize sick could passed on. Getting booster lowers likelihood becoming infected exposure could break chain transmission ends killing someone. 5-8 million depending age. look like normal variant. death serious symptoms reported. think going kill them? Certainly covid; fatality rate *far* low shift demographics significant way. even bring 30% 29%. October 7 best guess common ancestor current sequenced genomes. partial data.

Source : Also Greek Xi pronounced like 'ksai', hard K sound drawn 'sigh' sound? they'll go turbo conspiracy mode. They’ve reporting numbers get process actually happen. take it’s worth Time imprison people. threat society. 65% hospital unvaccinated 35% one dose. None fully vaccinated. couldn’t find vaccination rate Bara, someone else reported somewhere around 27%? So, 50 people hospitalized variant, would expect 13 fully vaccinated. 68.4% low. top regions 65%. clearly see worse regions higher vaccination rates

I think estimates get though winter without needing significant measures vaccination rate least 85%. lot people right You’re welcome! There’s many acronyms keep track days. Myocarditis transient. something overly concerned considering vaccinated prior probability even less.

The Moderna booster half dose Moderna vaccine. case, sorry. need things enjoy. Jesus! I’m sorry hear happened many kids aren’t allowed vaccine yet? Narrator: didn't. think that's true. FAA controls airline/airport requirements states. dispos: get Omichronic here! healthcare settings , masks still mandatory shitty whole thing is, made laugh. Botswana 😂 

Put facebook we’d blaming them. ….aaand found covid Gotta worldwide. Hope India. “Mild” head rough risk death — I.e. go hospital bad. Omicron around 30 mutations spike delta couple. may carry need wait see know many types cold virus, referring common one originated coronaviruses. $1000 dollars paltry sum accept return complete reversal one's principals beliefs.
get f outta judas...people.have right make decisions, even dont agree them. Give liberty give death! course that's means. bell curve pushed people would gotten severe cases get mild cases on. much B cell immunity hold it’s making new antibodies? That's plain wrong. strains really compete other, propagate multiple independent epidemics. said nothing? need get vaccinated get whole world vaccinated. beyond really do. animal populations... going away ever. might sound silly:

is safe get booster day go eye dr &amp; pupils dilated? like, eye drop dilation drops safe vaccine?

i heard vision stories that's paranoia coming True go football game, you’re probably going social distancing. anything lots people drinking, hugging etc. pubs closed long That’s unnecessarily restrictive commerce proof small slip paper government incredibly easy forge. Best option would recommend add small fee take home Antigen kit comes flight ($20 $350 ticket burdensome).  Good riddance. Got mine yesterday! Last night chills felt numb soreness already going away. Would recommend! can’t follow science it’s convenient.

Holy fuck thank you. I'm tired ""follow science"" people completely ignoring science fit panic-first mindset. Ah, thanks, clears up! Thought variant (significant other) first. science subreddit, r/covid19 science subreddit. Exactly N95 3-jabs club, represent. Several reasons concern:

* displaced Delta faster Delta displaced predecessor (Beta, think?), therefore probably infectious Delta, almost charts.

* huge number mutations... 50 baseline virus.  number spike protein, segment virus vaccines targeting... there's worrying chance people immunity vaccines immunity Omicron. 

* many mutations potentially different virus Delta... could lethal, could less lethal long term consequences, differences.  like novel potentially deadly virus novel again, we're rolling dice again.

* number people vaccinated US, health care system already overwhelmed Delta cases.  ICU beds running low, doctors nurses burning out, corpses piled trailers.  spreads faster Delta, could infect unvaccinated faster, greatly increase pressure hospitals.. they're already breaking point, may become broken.  might reach point people getting sick reason (including non covid reasons) can't get help hospital all... people could die home appendicitis child birth, people get health care still broke due cost.

People assuming much expecting... virus plain mean, can't contained measures US public government willing take point, new variant easier catch Delta potential nightmare... everyone expecting bad news days means coping reality world pandemic. understand, I'm talking thing, sniffles, cough, maybe low grade fever require hospitalization visit.

That's want be. Apparently “expert” truly believe United States already donated vaccines countries every country combined. 

Does someone statistics that? Ideally separating pledges already given vaccines. Could tested positive ago sequencing results came recently don’t get access new year omicron might get speed Oh shit. It’s everywhere news new variant make clearer ever pandemic end global vaccinations. United States already donated vaccines countries every country combined

This bit misleading. needed end pandemic total exports, virus care whether vaccine donated exported. comes total exports, US exported around one fifth EU China has. sure these, yesterday confirmed one Belgian person *not*. sister-in-law! wear masks indoor public spaces here, idea wasn’t case states! Could, can’t. Can, won’t. Should, maybe, shorn’t. think anyone said two weeks old, evidence spread November. It’s South Africa, it’s bc shitty people general. Buying fake tests prevalent world. possible explanations? grandma going absolutely devastated loss. Excuse asking, SIL? Aside fact South Africans general vaccinated, also bear mind *huge* proportion likely naturally infected (the number excess deaths massive), looking number vaccinated people hospitals tell us much whether new variant good evading immunity.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yup headlines pointless. They'll cause panic. variant there. We'll never stop spreading, like never stopped delta. 

The things matter severity disease causes, vaccination efficacy. 

There hundreds stories coming days, one case detected country X, 4 country Y, etc. Irrelevant, everywhere! Let's get data really matters. Pfizer vaccine. However, I'm going booster considering requesting Moderna. apparently common Moderna cause myocarditis. 

I know chance side effect rare stopping getting booster. However, curious myocarditis temporary? Like, otherwise healthy person, something overly concerned about? know doctors often terrible bedside manner?

Well, many researchers terrible social understanding. Yup. 99% people realize game changer mRNA vaccines are. BioNTech, etc saved shit ton people.

Highly recommend reading it. explain shame thing works? sounds like judging someone else's opinion disagree with. list places US okay survival fittest, Michigan list. 16 days long incubation time. Wonder Mozambique traveler first symptomatic. full martyr cause. That's hope too. mutations spike protein may help evade immune system effectively hopefully cost ability dock ACE2 receptors uses spike protein for. data might suggest that. mild cases people without immunity, asymptomatic people immunity, low hospitalization rate. Fingers crossed. high variability outcomes one aspects disease that's hard understand. People form strong opinions based experience experience someone know (It sniffles!), that's really valid understand risks. Two people similar demographic health condition get it, one really might get sniffles, get deathly ill. That’s probably true, though made efforts flatten curve well, and, still say density matters lot. need honest failures blithely stating vaccine holdouts get vaccinated new variant wrong. Stating otherwise undermines credibility. Especially majority world B cells works variant, matter long pandemic many variants. DTW major Delta Hub, also pretty big international travel hub. Case trajectory outcomes lag behind positive tests severity illness probably weeks month? time clearer picture. vaccine effectiveness probably two weeks ought give enough data begin drawing picture. Maybe little sooner. We’ll know well vaccines hold know much changes severity.  Slow news day. Honestly idea. time going tell bad won’t know like two weeks. recent things Ives seen SA seem show milder highly transmissible. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* missed joke Hahahhah, come on. would question expertise XD  (or whichever entity) naming even look see claims name? 

they chose greek letters rather place names like used past (see spanish flu south africa variant). hurricanes US named set common first names (followed set uncommon ones many storms one year). also consult ""bertha's bath house"" ""trevor's plumbing"" making decision understand scientist leaders telling everyone caveats 500% figure everyone eating right now. Every single scientist saying wait data come out. shit discovered last week. look you. Spreading initial bullshit idea spike mutations even are.  Oh great Covid, bring child blood sacrifice appreciation almighty power Good hear. Whereabouts u located? im ready another lockdown. let’s go omnicron! im cheering u !  Compared European neighbors:
Less severe restrictions pandemic
Vaccine hesitancy
Way guns
More conservative
Values individual freedom highly
Low taxes everyone vaccinated it'll fine. see judge us much taking sun holiday. Mild symptoms hyped. Get vaccinated pass. mean else supposed say? Tell people get vaccinated? say anything all? Tell unvaccinated take pseudo-science remedies instead? people staunchly vaccine likely even get watched closest loved one die. point experts convince unvaccinated; unvaccinated convince themselves. test waves Africa...I thought surfing...😔 left kapt here. miserably sick couple days first second Pfizer. day Pfizer booster, sleepy. Fauci must pumped, spotlight time coming around. fair, original COVID-19 took couple weeks really ""take off"" kill someone, interim often mild. important make distinction virus' ability escape immunity cause infection vs ability escape immunity cause severe disease. speculation point wait full answer

So, want mention possible Omicron evades vaccine-induced immune system cause infection point cause severe disease. nuanced important distinction. again, speculation point, answer come eventually. don’t variant. primer fails get 2 positives instead usual 3 “S gene dropout” disappeared Alpha.

Yea, would sequence sure, it’s variant spread silently requires full sequence even detect. long you’re seated actively eating drinking, can’t get spread others. There’s invisible barrier covid hasn’t managed penetrate. /s case there’s doubt. Get booster. protect now. months Omicron specific booster available speculation Omicron specific version even needed. 2 weeks Omicron variant jumped 75% sequenced variants South Africa. really good chance disagree misinformation problematic. I'm sure else would public health experts public facing comments continue encourage unvaccinated people get vaccinated. really strange. suspect still lot learn this. ""Knee jerk reactions"" ones chance working. Omicron spreads quickly feared, flight ban warranted. Unfortunately, reality probably already late. feared? information yet lethality vaccine effectiveness.

When people talk reactive instead proactive, reactive strategy looks like. 

Why wait data find screwed could take action two weeks sooner prevent problem getting worse? wait numbers find right thing? completely agree! I’m glad proactive shutting travel find out. It’s nice change pace waiting 100% sure something acting late. turns less worried reopen travel much lost. turns worse need buy time can. idea read today vaccine booster required one delivered 100 days. wish vaccine manufacturer day age. Should. won’t. 90% cases SA O... 1 novemdecillion (or decillion use long scale) chance 0 60 variety. got 3rd shot Pfizer. long wait get flu shot ?  Must gruelling 4-hour work weeks. Showing (still pretty sanitized) horrors war helped turn public consciousness Vietnam war. Maybe need see people dying fluid nightly news sink in. Where's data? cold flu since started wearing mask public, think keep that. Especially stateside shit Trump got - it’s dumb. guess seeing test likely see community. 

My hope quick painless variant. Lol, k. Considering Belgium case person arrived Egypt November *12th* (according sources provided Dr John Campbell), pretty much guaranteed already spreading wild US. ton countries too.

It Egypt November 12th, means kicking around weeks longer reported right now.

I'm trying alarmist here. still know lot it, including severe reaction causes humans. seem quite bit contagious delta variant. authorities Southern Africa downplaying it. I'm glad world leaders jumping try slow down. even assuming travel bans thorough (spoiler: they're really), might little late. “And ‘Xi’ used common last name.”

this outright false. doesn’t even crack top 100 among \[common Chinese last names\] Time’s comment speculation done deference Chinese president much likely explanation. 3 dose series, need 3rd dose. it, concerned. Lmao dude you’re living another reality. knew somebody NYC recently show vax card entire time. spreading misinformation.  magnitude travel US, zero chance US already. agree this. negative covid test back slight cough wore mask public kind others. support sure.  Triple vaccinated? current booster dose one that's gonna adapted variant? see, concerns me. Yes vaccines working die, Long Covid, someone myself, fucking bonkers people think Long Covid decent outcome here.

I'm sorry gone this.  problem us (vaxxed) well unfortunately relatively less deadly significantly contagious variant outcompetes current variant, fast-track us endemicity.  Completely agreed. travel lot work sucks. longer keep pissed I’ll become. It’s really can’t stand rebuttals along lines “it’s difficult stop whining”. They’re missing point: it’s mental fatigue constantly right thing still put interventions sake others can’t bothered. Asking virologists amongst us: rough estimate long take determine efficacy current vaccines Omicron?  No. need stop lying they’ve effective news new variant cause pro-COVID anti-vaxxers line shot.

The reality is, I’m sure reach people far rabbit hole misinformation. Certainly needs someone public health officials elected politicians. 

The problem people spreading misinformation (like Candace Owens Joe Rogan) benefiting solidifying clout obedient power base. never going tell followers get vaccinated. much obvious, literally know nothing hospitalization rates Omicron. could even considerably less Delta. Sounds like something Texan would say really doesn’t. people find amusement guessing, let it. Something distract. Im surprised requiring NAAT tests international travelers. Heading Hawaii next week within states requirement negative result 72 hours advance boarding flight. Italy one case Omicron variant Fully vaccinated boosted, I'm wearing mask flu season even though I've years flu shot. minor inconvenience, easily tolerated. Fair point, skepticism solved 5 minute conversation doctor. political topic. discuss keys vaccine political rally, discuss doctor's office. Long covid still pretty bad outcome vaccines cut chance lot less hospitalisation/death.  Basically, no. I'm packed train right - standing room - there's one person wearing one. 55 years hey everyone! Mild case (pre-vaccine obviously) still steroid inhaler lung problems! 21 months later. 

We really need looking chances getting Long Covid getting infection vaccinated. original comment said ""asymptomatic mild"" think mind ""horribly suffering weeks hospitalized"" Professor SAGE also said he's really disappointed fearmongering including peers using phrases like 'horrific' without significant data. People want fully lockdown, works best. government make compromise. Even government something else, another group people mad. Narrator: was. Source? Riiiiight! Cause gonna change minds. edited part says *edited*

Also bro, Pfizer Aline made 37 billion profit.
After 37 fucking billions profit one quarter still want argue vaccines aren’t profitable . Lol. 

*oh returning new infectious diseases*
Ffs billions profit would too. admitting stuff profit (like every company), let acting like 40 billions profit doesn’t exist lol 

Are innocent? company stuff it’s profitable. That’s things work. 
Also didn’t said governments didn’t finance it’s residual. also finance governments needs pharma companies lobbying associated it.
Also governments can’t much since can’t force private companies ask don’t threat well.
It’s almost like game power pharma companies want benefits acess taxpayers money government want acess health technology keep people satisfied.

Still can’t understand hell socialism this. don’t get say vac wouldnt exist without trumps magic also democrat hoax. true? obviously understand situation better world leaders scientists advising them. Learn things, read. Jfc… vaxxed, like 4-6 days sick, last timed different, muscles pain, fatigue two last times, headache fever, let know don’t respect mesures ; gathering, mask distance..  think that’s good approach. I’d like think people right thing stay home they’re sick, already I’ve already proven people can’t trusted. Guy came office despite clearly looking sick, tested positive next day ultimately got couple others sick. It’s worth you’re sick, don’t bring anyone else you’re denial sick. find new variants PCR tests you’re varient testing positive PCR samples. Ie; get “wild type” result it’s usually bad thing, variant test looks traits given variant. you’re variant testing delta response non-specific, that’s picking similarities original virus. 

As full recognition; that’s sequencing. virus first discovered necessarily source. know nothing yet countries reacting like March 2020. vaccines, masks, testing abilities. Overreacting bad reacting slowly.  


There reasonable measures put place know virus.  


SA released information stating cases point mild believe vaccines still working it. It’s simple. 1/1000 people hospitalized either variant, 10x people infected omicron that’s still 10x strain hospitals. Note: aren’t real numbers I’m using explain potential risk. implying they're actually experts field predicting unvaccinated people's behaviors. Stop federal funding states helping. option? Seems like speculation, necessarily proven pinned one specific Scientists say unusual constellation mutations suggests **may have** emerged chronic infection immunocompromised person, untreated HIV/Aids scientists think new variant **may have** emerged HIV patient know people gotten J&amp;J 1 shot shots Pfizer Moderna could mean anything really. contagious higher mortality? Yeah…this isn’t anything correct. let Delta variant ravage us summer long. Omicron comes, it’s transmissible say could be, Florida right back was. 13th lowest? Ahh, another post r/agedlikemilk frustration. 3 weeks feeling comfortable society first two doses Delta hit. booster 3 weeks ago go again. Oh well, poor me. I'm still healthy I'm happy grateful vaccines.

I really feel bad health care workers, I'm sure much longer many hang there. lot federal employee deadlines mandatory vaccinations also hitting, noncompliants starting see disciplinary action realizing Government bluffing termination getting butts gear get stuck. Vaccination helps reduce amount spreading quite lot, best have. Like said there's end sight, can't lock decades. Oh god way prevent … like … TRAVELING PANDEMIC! impressed Mr. Biden. 

First, know Omicron first identified South Africa, developed there. throughout Northern Europe. 

Second, need close borders. Completely. little, late, slow. Yes, need move products. place recreational traffic pandemic. one week delays. Close. 

This public health, politics. 

We need real leadership along lines FDR fireside chats. need plan everyone understands. need enforcement vaccine mask mandates. need national RealID compliant vaccine credential. need people STFH cook themselves. need 90% vaccination. need business community support curbside pickup everything. people go work can't remote; running Starbucks coffee essential adds risk must go work. 

Vaxx + mask + distance + curbside + STFH. LOL.  Experts understand Americans. 😴😴😴  time Nah. Covid started china. studies quite flawed. Covid indeed started way earlier Italy would noticed it’s effects. didn’t though, started china. really truly hope people charge learn tactic work. faked (as anti vaxxers said) wrong tactic use attempt scare people right action work.  
When revealed BAD is, people tired care. 

This fifth wave, true second part covid. still third act go. omicron found testing yet would likely mean delta still dominant strain. However likely means omicron yet fully vaxxed boosted immune suppressed ass gonna keep teaching 10 hours day N95. switched comfortable cloth surgical masks looks like days now. B cells fantastically incompetent. clueless question lol Uh, test positive absolutely isolating. kind question this? idiots think like continue spread misinformed opinions disguised facts. PotUS would probably bit dark. ""Either reach 90% vaccination rest die off, reach 90%.   7 days preceding September 3, 2021 computed COVID-19 cases per 1 million people country well percentage population fully vaccinated.

7 days small window analyze global data, particularly much world lower point Covid cases due seasonality. 

The one region surge cases, US south, saw correlation vaccination hospitalization. 

These cherry-picked numbers. It’s name scientist would love. don’t know enough covid itself, cold climates force people indoors prevent effective ventilation it’s good environment airborne virus. almost like infection numbers go cycles, Florida got hit hardest first. 😯.   ""You feel bad"" implies feel differently do. disagree that, feel fine Underrated comment. experts tell public get vaccinated? course Delta prevelant South Africa short ago. Delta prevalent everywhere. need call Autobots, Omicron sounds like Decepticon.   ""vanilla covid"", god, wish 2019 upon reading would think ""sounds like interesting ice cream"".😔 Schipol airport shops eateries seen,  fantastic airport lots opportunities mingle. omnicron hits covers known it’s pretty good.  Okay china. Go fear monger someplace else.  don’t disagree. Still though prefer culture alternative news taking opportunity blast we’re back March 2020, without science claiming that.

Show one news article said this. one. Yep, time take first business trip states since covid.. even pronounced same. ""horribly suffering weeks hospitalized"" high percentage. 

You’re also missing vast numbers people never notice it. Given common pick cold traveling air, I’m skeptical well works.  Lol world isn’t “struggling” contain Omicron. It’s barely even trying. Stopping direct flights South Africa (but countries haven’t similarly stopped direct flights) can’t considered anything repainting crumbling foundation.

A big part problem response Covid lot like Simpson’s meme, [“We’ve tried nothing we’re I'm fairly certain covid last march (similar symptoms now) near beginning pandemic. I've also double vaxxed since August. week I've tested positive covid again. Considering I'm double vaxxed, proper hit like brick I'm thinking may omicron variant.

I think small number positive cases sent variant testing. could loads omicron variant UK already know.  true. data yet. *possible* incredibly unlikely. booster shots. eligible would hesitated. ok thanks know situation SA  saying family -- way we're ever going hit 90% vaccination US unvaccinated start dying enough drop % 30ish 10. unfortunately happen quick enough avoid hospitals getting overwhelmed.  course it’s already here, you’d daft think wasn’t Get first, second, third vaccine dose. J&amp;Js also newer platform. sure idea came from.

(Which say newer = worse risk anything. correcting meme see often j&amp;k ""old"" method vaccine) Toilet paper ammunition impossible find. Maybe move 3.4% 2% mortality rate. would put flu. better safe sorry...or want another reactionary situation already surging people clogging hospitals, south right throw another denialism hissy fit? time, want us back offices. governor can't ways. Antibodies active infections, t-cells long term immunity.

T-cells recognize variant work variant. 

How media focuses antibodies nothing short either stupid, fearmongering. South Africa cases time variant started spreading, much competition. Direct flights Vancouver South Africa. ... now. get sick year half wore mask. ended getting covid mid October year, probably one time took mask eat plane 😢. fully vaccinated Pfizer doses imagine got new variant. However take several tests catch it. HK travelers found positive 4th test. Coincidentally watching transformers week feeling creeped haha Right? expect world listen house disarray? Florida second country total cases per capita 6 weeks ago, state dropped 13th Tl;Dr:
FDA put clinical hold EUA children's version Covaxin marketed USA Ocugen. FDA provide list flaws application Ocugen address. question outperform delta SA Watch next two weeks, particularly Africa. could end infectious less severe Delta vanilla COVID. Delta isn’t prevalent South Africa though, don’t know draw conclusion yet. Probably delta. Honestly. changed definition fully vaccinated 3 shots.

Hope get well soon. US cdc one worst countries sequencing. Also keep eye age people die start seeing mid age people dying old major problem 1918 spanish flu killed middle aged old young massive inconvenience Christmas, I've got friends coming country 4 days might even worth now. Hey agree, left important part criticizing guy.  Somebody set us omicron  world soon, ready. question outperform delta SA  humanity still exist time get Omega? Yes, usually transmissible is, less virulent is. Viruses want survive kill thier host virus dies host. Therefore, best interest virus eventually mutate way contagious deadly. Remember, viruses brains think ""I want destroy humantiy!"" Viruses want survive. could actually good news, means less virulent. know yet. Nobody afraid cold! Strange. typo perhaps numbers always unique?   point COVID-19 mutates enough evades vaccination natural immunity entirely also lose ability infect people. Square peg, round hole. Deaths take show counts too. least I’m located, theyre usually added day die. 

It’s wait see game, media, public officials, everyone else reasonably hates. We've return office date pushed back many times, even think schedule announced point. words ""Africa alright without vaccines"" EVER true?  skipped ""Nu"", called ""Xi""? Wasnt New Zealand able use travel restrictions great effect? natural evolution especially virulent virus. kills host quickly, often variant makes host sick enough replicate eventually out-compete virulent kind. 

I'm sure play here, since covid deadly, things considered, damage like bomb exploding. time worse effects felt, virus stopped replicating anyway I'm really hoping golf rules No, US sent ambassadors Taiwan. thank China dip Dow. market give single fuck covid, they've gotten richer crisis. want timeline. Someone, load old save choose differently sounds like rich-ass countries got vaccinated vaccine targeted specific mechanism virus virus evolved new mechanism holiday poor-ass countries.

Maybe create multiple vaccines target multiple mechanisms probabilities virus evolving new mechanisms low enough time vaccinate entire planet. terrible. Eventually strain evades vaccines bet booster shot # 56 point.  would Jesus weep? God make allow happen? Good one, open joke normal traveling internationally lot North America Asia unfortunately. gets views clicks? media ever talked variants without click bait titles?  causes spiders crawl ass would even worse. CARES KEEP LOCKING PLEASE omnicron getting much news coverage previous variants concern? remember people Mu, Lambda, delta plus going super serious vaccine defying ended much impact… makes one much different? I’ve vaccinated, get booster two weeks (they booked then), wear mask public, socially distance much possible. else world want do? I’m exhausted Covid. looking forward 2022 Omicron really said, “nah”. sure SA, India Delta wave cheaper buy fake negative test actually take test. advocating focusing instead making comparisons countries. Americans nothing it, one thread making comparison order defend beliefs. Unfortunately there's even chance opposite happens.

Omicron turns sprinkle instead big hurricane, anti-vaxxers keep dumb.

Your best course action covid vaxxed, world can't much stubbornly stupid.   Omicron: Challenge accepted ""of concern"" past 2 years almost ? supply issues would've even worse.  Even higher breakthrough factor, needs hospitalizing people rate higher Delta justify continued travel bans lockdowns etc. early tell guess we'll know couple weeks manufacturers rate testing positive today actually wind hospital. Yep! Especially considering actually evidence vaccines ineffective Omicron. reason people believe due criminally irresponsible reporting capitalizes general public's limited scientific literacy. gives back lost hope. Thanks.  Yup, risk cost-benefit analysis personal level. point, we've dealing pandemic almost two years straight. exhausting. personally still living like recluse 95% time (and still careful times socialize travel), friends regularly go bars dance classes strangers. that? No. recognize impossible everyone live like recluse. I'm even sure much longer go like this, now, long take calculated risks protect others best ability, feel guilty. Especially people shop maskless antagonize mask wearers. understanding infection immunity broader (attacks parts virus) varies widely person person can’t count it, vaccinations reliably invoke Booster vaccines effective strain announced shortly everything fine. need panic full lockdown. continue wearing masks everyone. could phrased bit differently. Bottom line, good cautious investigative comes Omicron, need hoarding toilet paper yet. pandemic full surprises!  Mexico resort rapid test barely put nose gave negative result minute later. I've heard one ever tests positive resort what's known one gives positive results. 

They could gotten tests facilities operate manner SA.  Worthless pricks. Lol ok Man humans bad They're thousands miles away industrialized world, Pfizer Moderna allow produce vaccines. groundbreaking idea get shots? Nu-Covid......

Fred Durst getting excited. Right that’s lockdowns happened Delta hit couple months back first… may exist countries low levels it’s responsible significant number cases. would picked genomic sequencing now. curfew style lockdowns seem like may harm good. Restrictions Restriction sake, unlikely much irritate people cause workers lose income. I’m glad wonder now, delta around while. Maybe winter? Isn’t Reddit works?

“Shoulding” people isn’t terribly effective large swath population. Netherlands great many flaws opinion, comparing United States like comparing Hendrik Lorentz Louie Gohmert.

Being dumb American, google Hendrik Lorentz. agree something gone really Wrong, think Pathcare / lancet labs much leak, especially security verification codes built results. 

I agree something tripped big time. know something yet.

Maybe got around watching documentary 1918 flu. Man froth twitter Reddit bad people. 

I saw one guy claim 100% certainty vaccines wouldn’t work without evidence. Frustrating. guess plus side, kills pandemic. Either we're going get false alarm media government lost credibility. Unvaccinated people get Covid? Say isn’t so. Wtf CDC sequencing find things? sure? make indistinguishable authentic certs, maybe even virus can't differentiate fake cert real one. /s dunno…in town last vax clinic line door. think big “wait see” attitude. roommates anti vax got since one would hire him. yea, driver, working.

I people would realize, it’s deep! Don’t overthink it! issue. Moderna already said enforce patents. pre-cursor needed supplied moderna isn’t something go corner store pick up. Dude. virus put countries allowing people even see family two years. shit kicks stock market every months caused widespread supply chain disruptions. mention it’s literally killing people millions. You’re better anyone ignoring that. realize much harder move abroad now? Moving abroad joke. realize hard us Indians get visa approvals. live privileged first world country (I'm guessing USA) even slightest inkling tough Indian move abroad.. Usually, Indians get one chance move abroad, two.. care, that's last chances.. 
If born first world country, would much easier bounce back country I'm living would resources need worry planning move elsewhere, apply visas, build social /professional network, whole grind. We've seen latest variant.

That doesn’t mean definitely will. 

Could people wait bit actual science declare things? Maybe stop whining countries push citizens get vaccinated new damn variants don’t spring again.

Do nothing 3 months spirals control China? appreciate urgency they're taking time even turns nothing. No, not. 

There incredibly high likelihood protective omi. it’s already protective delta others. 

There good reason people wait. None. I'm non native English speaker wondering many jokes comparisons sardines. What's funny it? Thank ! Yea idiots dont realize disgraceful are. pains watching killing like Nah, buy all. Every last roll. hand vaccinated.

Solve mess toilet diplomacy. Yeah, forcing people take connecting flight certainly stop going places need go. virus high mortality rate wouldn’t able spread, it’s advantageous evolve Boris Johnson made point wearing masks public transport (where still required) theatre (at venue asked people mask up). hard see culture coming from.

I’m now, great argument. Can't blame her. tried protect country integrity. Whatever happens? Really... New COVID album GOOD.  Everything reminds much delta. Doe snot bode well.

I mean understand South Africa feeling. bothering proper analysis essentially getting punished it. course happy. think focus varient going next delta... personal experience is?
Get grip.
You much information everyone else here. Media media. gut feeling that’s essentially thing. Ehhh 2007 right 2008 crash though lol 2004 much better IMO Yeah care...you'll start caring variant much deadly Maybe stupid question create transmissible less deadly variant? describe vaccine Perhaps medical science progressed much last century. 1918 people could see today's technology would freak out.  wild incredibly effective vaccines still people refusing take it, dying miserably instead. Propaganda conspiracies incredibly effective too, sadly. It’s required wear masks public transport England that's say. *Insert “First Time?” meme here..* Yep. acquaintance went Thanksgiving zero sense taste smell ""feels totally fine."" hope elderly parents vaccinated.  here. husband traveled within US September trip saved marriage. It’s one best trips I’ve ever gone remember rest life. vaccinated wore masks course plane. rest time outside hiking hotel room. don’t guilt it. saved trip followed protocols. COVID. think confirmed new strain. I'm waking though calling Texans unhappy unfree! Lol grandparents generation NEVER complained rough it. full hope optimism still. people family abroad, totally get it. It’s gonna hard go without seeing family extended period time. People don’t live forever, I’m fine long people take appropriate precautions honor public health guidelines/restrictions. 

I don’t really get people going abroad visit tourist though. worse, people hop international flight run airline mileage balance higher status. personally wouldn’t want get stuck abroad without good reason, that’s happen test positive flight back home takes (and places force quarantine). don’t get enough vacation time work make work anyways, even wanted to. I’ve calling omigawd. anyone wondering, leader sounds like. Available flights could become difficult. Europe, UAE, Qatar, US already stopped flights. Ethiopian Air regional airlines appear open may stop eventually too. Ah, see fan consent.

Rapist.  Well, look much protein actually changed extrapolate that. still tons antigen sites changed, virologists believe vaccines also neutralize one. Probably less effective, still effective. booster? treat respiratory infection like COVID rely test results. Exactly this. That’s boils to. takes longer people develop symptoms. Everyone planes South Africa tested negative, able get plane, vaccinated well. 10% passengers tested positive. Could another days develop symptoms. knows. seems infectious, really bad news unvaccinated/immunocompromised. think things travel messy week so, know more.

I understand but, response actually incentivize people lying covid data make country looks fine.  know vaccinated man (60 year old) died, think vaccinated AZ. Chances exposed it; maybe mild case (or few), maybe never officially 'had' it. 

You take antibody tests; sorta determine whether COVID within last months (I think go far 18 months COVID here, like 6 months). much sensitive 'natural' antibodies vaccine ones, get positive those, chances illness. think tests designed like that, happen be.

I’m pretty sure it’s around awhile. learned grade school. still shows normal PCR rapid tests. love downvotes got accurate statement. Nature doesn’t give fuck anything. It’s completely random. no, Mother Nature us. Fucking silly. China Covid control, doesn’t matter variant comes B.1.1.529 positive cases HongKong China double vaccination, basically current vaccination can’t stop get infection new variant, protect getting killed. I'd say pretty close zero point. Americans dumb anyway I'm surprised. 100 vs 100k daily cases Xi used common name?

Great minds think alike. /s anyone made list countries reported cases new Virus Mutation (Omicron)? That’s given. HYOOOOOOGE Chise's Account: 

“The new Omicron variant Coronavirus results MILD disease, WITHOUT prominent symptoms.” -Angelique Coetzee, chairwoman South African Medical Association."" months. found South Africa early November it’s kicks odd PCR tests would noticed. Also literally take screenshot QR Code app. Send unvaccinated friends 99% time identification needed complement QR code long gender fine. hilariously bad someone like works IT. flu endemic never going away. It’s clear COVID thing. So, logic, you’re saying one ever travel internationally ever again? Got it….. vaccines masks protect us. It’s choice want stay home rest life. don’t force choice among everyone else. Nah, I'm Twin Cities. Things pretty bad around Minneapolis Saint Paul relatively low cases compared surrounding areas.

I feel like I'm much danger. there's essentially ICU capacity left makes angry leaving metro seeing one wearing masks. Haha Ignorant people North America... us still aware. speculation Given incubation period typically 3 4 days something doesn’t add up. heavily mutated virus we’ve seen far, specific area it’s mutated (the spike proteins) area may cause reinfection/vaccine evasiveness. also looks like may transmissible Delta. Here’s article talks   South Africa often praised transparency comes Covid though.  hope nobody looking hence able find ,but guess that's stretching bit. England none right rest life?  Facial expressions matter :/ hope so. knights? big cities I’ve visited seem high mask wearing. go city it’s COVID over. Yes, don’t think used thing you’d daily normal circumstances pre-Covid. felt safe enough would cancel now. There's indication yet new variant increased threat, way worse Delta. simple things increase safety, eating socializing outside, wearing mask indoors, that, especially makes feel relaxed.  weird watching stuff like unfold 3-5th time governments people acting like first kind event. Fuck frustrating answers test use them. could see hard data new variant knew efficacy vaccines prevention, could let negative testing vaccinated people efficacy high, playing fire. Also unvaccinated folks would get extended vacation Netherlands. think actually unique question. hotel rooms went unused airbnb related sites got popular people bought second homes investments market went people finally moved. 

i think point banking rates go people sell investment homes market stablize bit makes think around weeks months? Wishful thinking supports theory, something concrete? hope you’re right, nothing hope. worse ever.

No won't. even close. Pretty much now, wearing mask vaccine seems answer currently current possibly future strains. data comes boosters help gradually this, mask vaccine stay.

I feel people fatigued now, everything like double mask double vac, getting around getting booster shot pretty much green lit everyone, vulnerable. Debates wear masks, take vaccines, abide rules, etc. definitely wore point I’ve given trying change others’ minds. voluntarily want get sick it’s them. 

If wear masks take vaccine preferred level (currently boosters) fear new strains part diminish. turns claps old double vax current booster, it’ll 2020 impatiently patiently wait Covid vaccine patch. Wouldn’t surprised play game every six months so. It’s starting shape society like flu new strains get covered yearly shot. years one gets luckily flu there’s backup procedures. similar ones come Covid (antiviral pill something) really start feeling like deal flu. really might turn way given massive spread mutations spike alone. Might able infect spread faster effective replicating, allowing innate response take hold without overwhelmed. Perhaps lower viral loads. Time tell.... Well stay wtf Society would literally collapse 1 3 Firstly sorry losses, rough can't imagine going through.

This virus taught us things didn’t know coronaviruses general specifically spike.

It’s really hard make good prediction single amino acid change going affect virus’s behavior, let alone 23 changes.

One thing true Biology Nothing Life Free. examples mutations organisms offer benefits costs. spike came many rounds reproduction optimization. many changes almost certainly impact overall function spike, 1) bind cell surface 2) fuse viral membrane cell membrane, order.

The machinery allow flexible, infinitely so. can’t change amino acid amino acid. changes make spike work less well.

It’s difficult model exactly evolutionary forces would given rise variant, may person-to-person transmission wasn’t one pressures.

But nowhere near point able read sequence spike accurately predicting variant behave. Cant much recognized easily PCR tests Merry Christmas too! Well said. Travel bans drag either they're serious disincentives honest reporting - they're okay sort circuit breaker make much public health sense variants clearly circulating ages. end virulence hospitalisation here, even higher transmissibility end world much worse Delta terms breakthrough infections leading sickness death.  nervous systems meant level uncertainty challenge.

Luckily T-cell antibodies still go strong even 6 months, still protected severe case. knows would happened wasn’t vaccinated? 

The person got similar timeline doesn’t lingering issues though, makes anyone feel better. guess I’m one lucky long covid people. mask game. pissing around cloth pleated masks. N95/KN95/KF94 bust. healthcare worker NYC guarantee December worst initial wave 2020. omicron changes nothing, would still severe epidemic exactly COVID ""subside""? closer people longer contact, likely risk infection.  evidence countries ban list “hotspots”, even point origin

This factually incorrect think around weeks, maybe months. might actually good thing gone undetected long means different delta, maybe even less severe. King County?  I'm sorry loss, loss. sure become dominant, said Delta first detected. Japan ( Asian countries like Korea China) HUGE mask culture began many many years ago (even sars epidemic).

Just watch Asian drama see cultural norm people cold/flu wear one infect anybody else, many use covering faces cold/ people's eyes, alergies even style. 

It's whole different culture. basically suggests people checked COVID vaccines travelling.  Indeed...a lot folks get described medically ""mild"" COVID infections say horrifying experience wish worst enemy. read omicron cases far ""mild"", really anything make feel better, could still mean something could take weeks leave disabling symptoms months longer.  think asymptomatic vaccinated people around world got tested we'd find lot cases general. point vaccine cares.

Maybe, maybe not. enough info yet. care sentiment science. literally says many mutations similar delta variant there’s evidence evades vaccines yet. said there’s breakthrough infections, that’s true variants. expected, misleading alarmism.

They probably “new variant” bingo cards pandemic. Even better! Nothing said logical. South Africa poor vaccination rate. Gee, else could possibly be? must bypasses vaccines. /s  We’re asking pandemic season 3 I’m glad cleared quickly. experts don’t seem understand people dealing with. looking age-adjusted graph?

Seniors likely severe case.  They’re also likely vaccinated.

So need adjust results fairly compare hospitalisation rates vaccinated unvaccinated.

The graph done that. actual rates hospitalisation real world.  It’s pretend population, 70yr old 18yr olds equally likely vaccinated months. Similar problems France. Even centralised system breakdown nobody verifies name QR scanned official ID. go restaurant scan QR code do. nothing stop someone registering friends (or anyone else’s) valid vaccination certificate using it. system relies name displayed it’s scanned persons ID don’t check ID essentially useless. 

Apparently places don’t “authority” ask ID problem. I’ve read places like nightclubs authority check IDs bother verify. 

I know selfish sister law using friends vaccination certificate registered *her* phone whenever asked covid pass 😡 Half country completely apathetic virus, executive legislative branches absolutely fucking useless, states run pro-COVID governors. US completely fucked. far, ""mild"" cases people knowing sick people still fully functional. friend, 30 years old, super fit, got Covid last year working Frontline job. trouble walking bathroom back bed. even passed one time way use toilet. like 5 weeks. still ""mild"" insane use world. need better tiers classifying severity. live corporate places still masked up. 2 us work wear mask shifts. customers even bother wearing masks anymore. restaurant industry playing dangerous game Modesto Ca It’s different every country. There’s “typical”. sequenced typical country?  infected passed long lines Heathrow arrivals already wide dispersion. Wait hope. Huh? terms case numbers, yeah, I’d say estimates change. Anyone coming concrete numbers though stage foolish – haven’t good predicting precise scale timing spikes even old variants. whether entered different phase terms impact hospitals, etc., early tell know whether causes more, equal, less severe symptoms.

Probably keep getting current vaccine boosters new one hopefully soon! pretty much now, greater degree. may finally mean move wide mandates ('obbligatory' vaccine all) targeted ones (mandates/regular boosting vulnerable people/elective everyone else). always sensible approach.

How many people get sick time? R number representation many people one infected person infecting. changes time due number factors.

If R number 1, one person infect one person level infection/number cases stays same.

If R less 1, 1 infected person infect fewer 1 person, level infection/number cases decreases. 

If R greater 1, 1 infected person infect one person, level infection/number cases increases.

The UK continually using R number measure public quantify understand pandemic.

The situation frustrating, giving help, make things worse. Ignore politicians, listen science, remember focus anger virus people trying help Yeah. I'm sure best interpretation data point is. people asymptomatic? find hard believe many people would board plane knowing sick. pre-symptomatic? so, long they/were incubating virus for? percentage passengers vaccinated/had virus already? know variant features degree immune escape, much?

If sign high degree asymptomatic/presymptomatic spread, could also sign virus less lethal... and/or also sign contact tracing effective practical variant. lot unknowns stage. Boosters effective there's point waiting worrying getting wrong one. selection pressure less deadly, host dies immediately infection virus doesn’t transmit effectively others dies out. Random mutations allow transmission allow survive effectively. Maybe.
I seen data incubation times hospitalizations. think following 61 people might helpful. none become seriously I'll, may good sign. No, tired covid need break. Can't omicron take one too? Please. far I’ve heard previously throughout this, UK (I think specifically Oxford?

Billions people replicating billions viruses billions billions dice rolls. fewer people contract less likely bad luck roll wind new VOC. understand it, VOC likely develop people immunocompromised - people bodies can't fight infection live long incubators virus. one prime reasons want many people vaccinated - hopefully protect ticking time bombs catching it. single parent (had kid young) moved last year.... 

Beginning doubt I'll ever get go out/have fun. lot infected flight aren’t testing positive yet, new variant transmissible feared. Depends deadly variant is. mortality rate high yes.  think use different definitions mild consider permanent injury consequence mild infection. like stay home. Cool. realisation wrong, yeah. 

So I’m bit less inclined treat one complacency sure shit wrong last one. etc seem think one big worry. Oh yeah next giant statue Lara Croft hall Pac Man mosaic tiles kitchen. transmissibility factor scenario 100×, *number cases* is. said, viruses spread exponentially. exemplifies higher transmission lower fatality implicitly favorable change. I'm shaking boots. -\_- /s muh rights (to spread viruses). expected provide least astronomically low

Those two different statements. Oil, lack it. Europe world must somehow restrain demand, one way another. American holiday? Well, $. Omicron , biggest variants, eat variants ? lose credibility know use apostrophe correctly. Outdoor transmission significant circumstances. packed Christmas markets different circumstance. entire point Greek alphabet names *not* associate variants specific countries.

There zero benefit naming variant Chinese president. Wait Nu? rename it? That’s generally viruses want. kill host replicate like mad. Why? Hell Ape favorite band. Seriously? Obviously wear double masks cancel school social distancing 1000 feet. Right, neighbor acting like COVID big deal bc don’t personally know anyone died - neighbor died. know virus Israel testing antibodies well breakthrough infection. Lowered antibodies equals higher rates infection. *waves hands* 

Tnairav emoceb ssel yldaed!  Exactly, very, weird. Almost can't possible. Could actually due fact Omnikron virulent got infected beginning flight tested positive 12 hours flying? won’t even learn deaths friends family. 

She’s right though - anti-vaxxers care themselves, asking act protect others waste time. whole family coworkers gotten starting April, we're fine side effects. couple breakthrough cases people know mild. I'd say go it, much better alternative vaccinated getting it. OMG WE'RE GONNA DIE...

Best case scenario US thing take months get almost spring. Good news end eventually. Trust I'm boat... I'm months behind rent electric seen family nearly 2 years..... bright side I've got lazy first time life I'm gonna miss days bed I'm back working 3 jobs. make it... will. try see positives it. Hell ever get fk play phone day world returns. like WHO?  afraid of? Genuine question wanna understand help f’n draining omg Vaccinated negative test.

But passenger arrived Belgium variant also tested negative departing. also orders magnitude off. Okay thought still think can't read.  can’t promise stuff like that. seems confirm indeed everywhere, SA detected it. Agreed, stupidest bit American exceptionalism I've ever read. That's scary ratio. There's new test corona virus variant. Stick finger ass smell it. smells like shit VARIANT. Thank later. 

\-emoskater1 Whelp, goes spring. 6 weeks design new vaccine. takes get regulatory approval start producing substantial amounts.  Israel Hong Kong Belgium, US, know yet. traveled internationally test negative boarding. assume wasn’t case here? Odd. dumb so. riding bikes. kind attitude would call yours? Yes, driven indoor transmission. Yep. Mine too. maybe time buy more? Finally I've found somebody else nose licking. hate unvaccinated Haha. Fantastic typo! Maybe so! Biontech develop two vaccines variants started talking regulator it. However, since standard vaccine still sufficient efficacy Delta, go regulatory production processes yet. get new variant every couple weeks, vaccine makers obviously wait variant shows substantial immune escape dedicating production towards new vaccine. course we’ve big surges summer last two years. it’s winter.  like see defense layers,

So far seems 1 step ahead coming crush, catch us… might data time  That's good. would suggest many planes already arrived infected passengers...... Fuck…. winter north it’s cold people congregate inside. summer south it’s hot people congregate inside. would mark end pandemic  believe goes *something* like put 5 drops red food coloring pale green (Delta) colored water, see red, even inside body. 
The prominent color ""takes over"" attaches cells easier it. 

Over time, add water, another drop green, another 5 red.... keep along line... ton red see green anymore. 

So, hung 2 friends, one Delta Omicron, Omicron: 1. better job evading immune response Delta attaches cells. 2. Omicron particulates transmitted, viral load higher, making Omicron likely predominant strain within body. 
Then, get ill sneeze out, spreading Omicron, much less Delta. 
Then Delta goes way Alpha. there's little indication says can't catch time, so, contact time, unlikely.

other that, right Nah, point anyways. guessing presenting guesses incontrovertible truths. Dude deleted comment…but data cnbc article variant found Belgium.

“The B.1.1.529 variant contains 30 mutations spike protein allows virus enter body, scientist Tulio de Oliveira said Thursday briefing held South African Department Health.” saving this.

great question! sure mean feel free elaborate. viruses really ""will survive""?

Like, thought observed events viruses becoming less deadly completely random event. I’ll add US stock markets better Las Vegas placing bets. huge sell late Feb 2020, sell Delta variant year. Today, get monumental sell off.

Not going pass judgment see next week is. that's true might see new form social distancing folk dissimilar views safery end invited holiday parties Please let extremely transmissible less deadly variant. We've extremely unlucky nearly 2 years now, let one. Reality seems quite morbid think it. nations strong weakest one comes COVID. sacrifice economy going lockdown there’s another country multiplying strains virus. That's thing. first one hardest. incremental changes therefore much easier since actually invent wheel. like yearly releases car model.  less infected people entering country slow spread. yes spread anyways 100% absolutely matters many infectious people circulating once...just stop completely mean help lot That’s sign guys. variant thing. mean delta variant sounds smooth. Omicron long letter looks like corona virus without spikes. Missed chance call Nu Gundam varient.

""we close greatness"" always. 1918, small number idiots opposed mask mandates precautions. Even US, people shunned basically forced comply.  Yep. I'll take comfort knowing chances getting sick even sniffles slim time being, long new variant ruin things. Again. person anti vaxxer. Check post history ignore. 23% Vax rate. people inherently selfish begin with. still wanna able visit countries bit tourists visit?

Get fucked. Shit well need go see also count media confuse ""cases"" ""hospitalizations"". Carl Bergstrom -

I'm concerned sweeping areas able acquire  evidence yet.  thing still going on? first assumed stock sale read that. I've read wr still know little idea whether vaccines still work well still works it. Nothing confirmed. Although fear could possibly evade vaccine immunity Thanks recommendation! downloaded it! Downvotes response based speculation rather fact. Yes think it’s Delta. also think means think least problematic Delta.  welcome!

Here quote live news Dutch health authorities said likely dozens people among 600 passengers landed Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport Friday test positive Covid-19.

Two flights landed South Africa, travellers isolated airport due concerns newly detected Omicron variant.

Initial test results estimated 85 positive cases among passengers arrived KLM services.

Further tests take place determine whether positive Omicron variant. air travel banned Friday, flights already underway exempt. lot us tired mask mandates though. really want end, wear masks though 2022 well.

So yeah bit panicked. Hopefully ends nothing. restrictions mask mandates months (Florida) want stay way... Omicron think criticism slow plus SA open sped response GME? Yes! boomer SPY DJI? Nah I'm good, make like 2% gain dip.  Let's forget we're trying read lot tea leaves essentially one case. ought big fat **SPECULATION** label. Nu sounds close Mu Variant  return office program remote work office need policy going get caught again. No, he’s much less alarmist Feigl Topol. Nu doesn’t come delta, epsilon does. Variants epsilon nu already discovered noteworthy enough gain widespread attention. Merck one less amazing clinical results come could escape antibodies T-cells defenses it. really thinning actually spread number people 10+ hr flight, rather number infected people boarding onset. 

Perhaps it’s virulent spreads quickly FYI, Greek letter Ξ (miniscule form ξ, romanized Xi xi) pronounced ""ksee"" one syllable, ""ee"" sound shorter like ""i"" ""machine"". significantly different (example chosen ""no specific reason"") [voiceless alveolo-palatal sibilant (IPA ⟨ɕ⟩, roughly ""sh"" + consonant ""y"") represented ""x"" pinyin orthography. general, ""X"" romanization foreign word requires additional explanation idea sound makes. anything involving ""x"" usually bad choice cross-linguistic punning ever planning speak loud live human person. could something there, could responding strongly many dropped ball delta. Claiming makes vaccines useless ridiculous stretch likely misinformation He’s really brilliant guy. wondering myself. Predictions evolve something transmissible, less severe. Could it? Seems little fast me, lots living beings mutate in. Still significantly better covid Yes!! impressively fast!!  imagine they're aware this, ""want"" figure speech case. seems so. point (globally) considering: 
* complete ban unvaccinated non essential travel. 
* People able return home quarantine secure setting (none ""promise stay one place next two weeks"") along strict testing. variant Egypt, right?? know?? Yea, know. though Nu would perfect variant lot new mutations.  /╲/\╭(ఠఠ益ఠఠ)╮/\╱\

“OH-OMEGA… 
“OMEGAH, OMEGAH!” im hearing vax shots boosters dont even matter version covid? im tired fuckery heh. right guess It’s like everything either Covid overblown hoax it’s end world human race doomed. hell. getting andromeda strain? Lol yes was. using clinical term we’re talking about. messaging bad 20 months people coronavirus sub still don’t know meant “mild” concerning itself.

“Mild” still feel like you’re going die worst illness imagine. don’t need hospital care oxygen. don’t care feds paying it. Oh thanks! [This one] OK thanks!  I've read descriptions breakthrough cases people never needed hospital utterly miserable. Yet still fall mild/moderate category. That's point, though. PASC (long-COVID) well-known occur following ""mild"" cases. thinking Unicron? Omicron fairly minor Deceptorcon transforms F-16 (I think).  I'm sorry  Guardian new vaccine could developed clinical testing 60-90 days. long clinical testing take? variant contagious think could enough time? Jesus thing sounds like it’s going blow stack R0 we’ve seeing. moderator take look article? 

1) Evening Standard high quality reputable source information - cheap tabloid paper, long history obscene, racist, clickbait, otherwise biased content. 

2) article cites single broken-up (and possibly incomplete context) quote single doctor. importantly - data back claim made article - headline content entirely based subjective interpretation quote. link back case counts, hospitalization numbers, etc. form validation citation.

I believe one GP's quote tabloid constitute high quality info here... especially thread getting high viewership now.  It’s 100% news covid. Someone posted link nice website listed Omicron cases country confirmed probable. Anyone know link? felt like .org? live exclusively outside summer? Then, according you, asymptomatic cases qualify mild. asymptomatic cases COVID-19 left people permanent lung heart damage. crashes 10-20% will. might rebound Monday. I’m curious see people do. goes right back up, fine, crashes lot, I’ll buy more. another 1-2% drop… meh, I’m sure.  Also infectious sooner onset pre-symptomatic spread able transmit lower viral load.   Yep I’m feeling pretty discouraged too. Fully vaccinated, wearing masks every day work almost 2 years now, there’s shitty piece news. racist point travel bans prevent entry, buy lots time avoiding reintroductions.  I’m immunocompromised got third Moderna full dose back. Sore arm first quickly moved fever took Advil Tylenol bring 101. huge swollen armpit looked like plague lasted week. Happy extra protection Delta spiked here, full dose Moderna third shot joke! Round 3! Give ROUND 3! 👆 that's justify deaths millions. Green lantern villain need mandatory cause everyone would gotten it. question: reason variant named ""Omicron"" rather ""Nu?"" would imagined variant named Greek letter Mu, I'm wondering scientists named decided skip two Greek letters instead. Shut u know first Ya vaccines work well /s used watch videos early days pandemic used informative. havent watched looks recent videos boy boy looks like he's fell rabbit hole hes clicks. data people vaccinated contracting Omicron? Yes, least seems 1919 Variant Spanish flu dramatically increased death rate among young people. again, again,  Nu already, skipped today. There's variant called Mu, might thinking of, never got big. wife's hospital hiring traveling nurses 100/hr would *not* think that. Look past 2 years. Moron variant factories Delta changed incubation period mean 4 days. newer variants I’m aware trending towards shorter periods since original 2 week incubation period. Delta shortest time span I’m aware of. I’m kind leaning direction moment.

Recall original virus longer incubation time. lot people didn’t show symptoms 10+ days exposure.

Delta sped up, weren’t sick 7 days, probably ok.

Omnicron doesn’t come Delta lineage.

I’m thinking perhaps longer incubation period like original strain, coupled higher pre-symptomatic asymptomatic transmission thus ton people get exposed anyone realizes sick.

The case Belgium didn’t get sick 11 days landed Belgium.

But purely conjecture. We’ll know soon.  sounds quite similar Xi pronounced Xi Jinping

Who's pronouncing pinyin ""x"" (pronounced ""sh"" + consonant ""y"") like ""ks""? Yikes. Rumor control basically confirming worst news this. website says Comirnaty.

So Pfizer  Exactly, AFAIK spanish flu endured 4 years. buckle up!  exactly criticism? well balanced fair analysis it, opinion.  recent videos seems giving credence ivermectin bs. yh id say seems verge becoming anti vaxxer. one video title literally called ""vaccination dissapointments"" scientific approach usually means things shown work, opposed things proven repeatedly work. Closing borders stop variant transmission Delta that's already five countries ""scientific"" praying rain.

Also, ""economic interests"" mean ""people's livelihoods,"" dismissive money involved people world need buy food. data yet. absence data, science says act conservatively data.  One hope peace. Covid fatal enough peace still everywhere yet rare enough catch it. country sequencing 1 10 positive detected cases. also typically takes 3 weeks NGS prep, run sequencer many samples multiplexed, run data pipelines identify variants. everything seeing far weeks past. vaccine handle mutation levels covid gad become. lucky vaccines already developed influenza. I’m US don’t sequence shit They’ve busy treating Covid patients study higher degrees media wants us live fear lol…people scared new variants like month forget month later…rinse repeat. Idk single person still even thinks Covid anymore. Tests required travellers whose final destination require it.

For instance, anyone fly Cape Town Mexico via Amsterdam without negative test.  One confirmed, far “Emergency!”

—Michael Scott Sure. now. Like it’s simple? It’s matter building hospitals (or setting tents) buying beds. Staffing problem. takes years train medical workers. killed bunch early pandemic providing adequate ppe drove bunch making lives miserable.

Public trust scientific/medical community probably all-time low lot zig zagging communication throughout pandemic.

Here reddit, tend bit inclined research get best information possible. 80-90 percent people much. Whatever I’m ready accept it. I’d rather die live like this. I’ll get booster monthly unbelievable.  CDC would announce genetically engineered virus would replace delta less lethal version, would start wearing masks, keep 6 feet apart religiously started washing hands.  Vaccined people transmit much lower rates. know that’s IFR new variant? Hospital capacity reason. Thanks forcing many nurses quit Governor Hochul. hear ""sEA Tol'd YuO VacsEeN's Work"" crowd already. certain places I’ve absolutely one wears em except working required. Obviously meant majority ppl. realize do. majority places absolutely understatement Never read comment summarizes thoughts situation accurately. I'm vaccine passports likes - get wrong.

But happens 3x vaccinated healthy twenty something gets covid? Probably feel like crap week two. I'm sure suck. possible scenario feeling like garbage little gonna sway going bar friends, catching basketball game flying go visit relatives.

Sure, there's small chance get hospitalized covid die...but there's also small chance uber take visit friend gets t-boned drunk driver die get seriously injured. That's life is.  allowing .3% people die unfortunately. That’s life works. risk profile everyday. You’re ready give 20 years life this? I’m certainly not. dumb dumb dumb wonder stronger reactions infected without knowing post vaccination it’s basically fourth dose. Viruses evolve, wasn’t unexpected.  massive arm pit swelling second Pfizer. Anticipating booster. primary physician took Moderna didn’t get reaction booster. *From article*...


Why variant worrying?

""The short answer is, don’t know. long answer is, B.1.1.529 carries certain mutations concerning. observed combination before, spike protein alone 30 mutations. important, spike protein makes vaccines."" Maybe us. think less accurate 8 days. done enough testing see particular PCR results correlate contagiousness. 

My take away reading testing testing still pretty reliable detecting cases contagious stage. biggest issue see 2 day window... Testing 2 days flying rapid testing day seems like significant amount time person move 'incubating contagious' 'not yet symptomatic, really doesn't. Huh?  Two flights .... one day.

Think flights arrived day before.

And day that.

♫ Thanks you. lucky great GF shares home really sweet cat dog. Bad time long already. 🥴 Right, lot people asymptomatic, never seek hospital care, etc. point, need move lives. I'm young, healthy, fully-vaccinated. currently covid, cold. Sure, I'll course continue isolate rest 10 day period, afterwards I'm going go right back normal life. I'm NYC, every social activity requires vaccination anyway, beyond think reasonable stop socializing rest lives. Covid stay, never ever going away point, matter much deny normal social life.

I wonder we'll even end self-isolating positive tests in, say, 5 10 years - respiratory diseases, all, seems unreasonable make everyone waste 10 20 30 days year isolation every winter forever. Think 3 different planes think we'll know new variant say end December like whether vaccines work less severe etc Definitely... always seems petty squabble prevents two groups working together. pretty obvious pretty quickly imo detected right now. PCR test already used identify it. Please - let's learn past. put masks, stay 6 feet apart, freak fuck out. Throw online raves, keep using garage-exercise equipment, find new skill want learn distract much possible.  


Think time life become someone new bit.  Manhattan around 5x denser Amsterdam. Maybe Amsterdam’s lack verticality older design makes people crammed certain areas Oh God, I'm looking get 3rd dose nearly died last winter. Gonna switch back kn-95 masks 😨  Ah see share experiences. train left station. Yes. variant-specific booster comes you, able get it. Best thing maximize protection now. Worst ever strain… *so far*  Hopefully emerge new mid century golden age. Like first one without racism. wrong still irritated continue travel willy nilly non essential reasons still unpredictable pandemic?

I mean, unless life death, stay f*co home? home country continent least? going around time, right. maybe going around extremely contagious. data support either claim.  Good time buy socks There’s Canadian reporter happens flight tweeting ordeal: Same.

There always TP, hand soap, canned food. may lawn chairs, listening FM radio, we'll essentials. holds power worst kinds political corruption imagine. know would explain Delta dominant, verify Someone posted above, seems grave me. nothing

I mean, I'm sure somewhat hyperbolic, obviously true? reduces amount cross-border spread, much would citizens included? discovered SA doesnt mean SA. ban simbolic act causes damaged economics forces countries hide variants discovered.  Omicron means skipped Greek letter lol Nu = Omicron

The skipping Nu sounds like ""new"" Xi name. stated reason common name. (It's also Xi Jinping's name, one wonders politics could involved least bit.) shall see coming Thanksgiving Black Friday driving straight Christmas. quite. People give restrictions easily. Ramen definitely don’t read books unmarked Egyptian grave unless Brendan Fraser side Source Moderna comment? Seeing got moderator removed, maybe sub mods explain rules regarding subject. Unfortunately that's get mutated variants too. The% young people vaccinated SA low. end well.  know. could compound surge. individuals refuse get vaccine even though free access it?  read earlier lot misspellings already lol. It’s **omicron**. markets pumped right money lost really huge. I've seen worse 1 day losses normal bad news. know ancestors felt dying diseases randomly. It’s often due lack logistics willing populations holding back, supply.

The data indicates true Africa using vaccines pretty much soon receiving them.

As Sep 2nd, Africa received 143 million doses. Sep 2nd, Africa used 106 million doses. Sep 25, Africa delivered 146 million doses. Oct 1, Africa received 200 million doses Africa administered 200 million within month.

The data shown Africa pretty much using vaccines given. see vaccines piling wasted unused. basically O.  NYC also got body slammed OG COVID early on. Well, take (wishful) upvote! mean, order magnitude would rather high, rather large figure hide abstraction. Omicron transform! 2 years taught us something finally overly cautious. guys speculating accomplishes nothing. assume applied EUA interim data 50% efficacy. that's probably FDA primarily looking at. 
 
However, huge drop implies second half trial efficacy around 10%. sample size big really unlikely due statistical variations. could sudden trend reversal due delta, would make Molnupiravir pretty much useless now. 
 
Another possibility cherry picked sub group high risk people interim analysis. would make sense since orders US conditional EUA approval gonna allow generic manufacturing poorer countries anyways. case could granted EUA subgroup, certainly though FDA gonna simply ignore did. 
 
Molnupiravir's Mechnism Action basically mutating enough errors viral replication replication fails. potentially danger mutating human DNA well unkown long term side effects. top that, new variants could evolve faster mutation accelerator. 
 
Merck's drug looks like expensive ineffective burden unkown risks involved. guess Pfizer's Paxlovid probably answer high risk population antiviral agent Bucillamine potentially pill standard risk population anti-inflammatory agent. Even combination considered since MOAs work complementary.  One person mean anything. Need much samples. case count went low 70 per day. Omicron would lucky super spreader event Delta get partake in.

Their case count low precisely much better Omicron around twice many spike mutations...

That means likely came someone immunosuppressed long-term infection like HIV-AIDS patient mutations beneficial particular patient. necessarily mean mutations super impactful broader many mutations well studied understood impactful

Yes, P681H less eliminated displaced P681R. would curious backwards evolution mutation competition previously proven growth cases also happening faster Beta Delta wave caused originally.

That could human behavior everyone aggressively piling unmasked bars longer caring. Well, sucks. AFAIK need phase II testing. gonna much faster I'm US neighbors mask burning party. really think that’s limiter? saying can’t better, many countries don’t infrastructure deploy vaccines citizens, let alone educate all. dedicate resources global fight, simple “capitalism bad” logic…  fucking kidding? I’m trolling. I’m asking help I’m fucking worried don’t access doctor turned 21 day state I'm went lockdown. missed college graduation pandemic (I got degree, mail). Yes tiny numbers small sample.   they’re afraid remove things go wrong, they’ll face massive backlash. top that, health officials already far risk-averse people either refusing provide guidance removing remaining ones making new justifications saying also help flu stay around. 

Ultimately comes terrible messaging. Also pay attention markets cause money line, people dont fuck around. Basically wall street gets scared, cause access info public. Better late never ಠ_ಠ Omicron, believe. Though googled ""omnicron"" plenty references it. Yeah, Spanish flu.  would involve tailoring viral DNA (rna?) that? seems insanely difficult let alone way make virus less virulent 500% infectious Delta.

that alone hyperbole fuck mention it. tale 3 parts. 
The patience doctor I’m first part legendary.
It ended sick vulnerable man dying would insane. 

Viruses friends. errant bits source code minimal hardware designed picked executed cellular machinery look pretty. self-replicating uncontrolled mutating code within body good hear ya. Two years degree intention online. It’s two years almost exclusive online lessons. full answer, here's something presentation detectability. 

The flights SA EU citizens only, tested negative rapid test 24 hrs boarding.

\* note rapid antigen molecular pcr different thresholds. rapid antigen returns false negatives symptomatic, molecular pcr detects almost *any* presence live virus (which course counts infection). virus supposed 5x infectious delta.

hopefully, infectious less dangerous \*cross fingers\* Actually every data suggests worst ever - worst mutations spikes, spikes, mutation spike evades monoclonal therapies (previous variants evaded some). 2 4 weeks mean must work SNF. 60 employees unvaccinated. many residents also unvaccinated, think ""the CIA microchipping them"" ( that's one patients said day"". Last wave would Covid ward simply awful! Muslim shower handheld bidet. connects water supply line tank. 

Life changing little money would mean twice contagious measels. differences Omicron previous variants small 

Omicron 32 mutations spike protein (delta 9), mutations capsid (associated increased viral transmission). Omicron also appears high viral loads, still clear escapes vaccine protection leads severe disease. We're obviously different situation knew dangerous virus going around. Back 2019 one looking it. we're looking hard it. I'm saying impossible already spread everywhere, using original COVID breakout example really fitting. Vegas strip actually extremely masked. Casinos enforce it. surprised.  No, greatest moment built selfless generation stood thought right.

The boomers ones building individualism shit attitude back greatest generation comes like asshole bully likes destroy global environment unprecedented rate. never strength.

No one World looks Texas think ""that make World better place."" Sir. makes sense whatsoever. 6 months food?  they're traveling, also means they're likely vaccinated, good...

The next 2-4 days either good news, really shitty news, guess. true would mean it’s incredibly prevalent South Africa little pressure healthcare system? understand. Cheers. Chicago! 90% people masks! Love :) getting COVID considered good fighting Virus? (Un)expected Futurama reference Lol, right. advertising platform now, TikTok going fast way. case, regular test determines variants detects missing protein compared strains. means found faster read whole genomes figure something up. I'm Buffalo county 10% positivity rate. hospitals full capacity. 6+ hour waits emergency rooms.
People reschedule surgeries.
I love too. since 1600s. Yes, please do. “Awwww...Here goes!” —Coolio I'm sad loss Nu Covid Covid Classic jokes. politics like entire pandemic. 

In USA terms (because that's am, translate country):

Team Trump wants downplay developments, including Omicron, COVID still flu bro Fauci goober whatever. matter couple neighbors die, still fake, even though believe doctor treats cancer, believe tells drugs work COVID. Instead listen pillow salesman.

On side, Team Rachel Maddow whatever actually sorta secretly wants every variant badass killer justify overly-rampant lockdown fantasies impose Team Trump people. (Team Trump obnoxiously marching around four years prior 2021 jerks charge, Team Rachel Maddow naturally wanting revenge likes locking Trump people houses trying guilt trip them.)

Meanwhile independents watching country burn like.... frack going Donald Trump Rachel Maddow mud wrestling CSPAN???

That's USA.

I'm gonna hope booster stays good effect another month try enjoy quiet Christmas vaccinated siblings parents. :) Tootles. That’s got attention sure. plus report cases went hundred two thousand couple weeks South Africa skipped Nu Xi, probably Nu would communications nightmare Xi would upset China. Greek letters Omicron used AFAIK, some, like Mu, haven’t made big splash. point hope evolves kill switch people actually take seriously don’t learn it’s directly affecting them. even shock penguins Antarctica somehow got it.

Well, summer Antarctica , flights McMurdo happening ;-) Yeah...
I mean Delta already ""should"" plenty incentive.  Actual lockdowns work. Partial lockdowns not. Delta sure didnt like name though, read yesterday company refers ""the variant"" Yes! Taking away resources vaccinated might comorbidities get infected. vaccinated need admitted medical issues. unfair. We’ve recently booked vacation Rome late February. I’m nervous may able travel. think I’m trying say choose lockdown again. NYC (where live) open thru delta it’s great. I’ll vaccinate, I’ll respect ppl want mask and/or work remote, besides want live life. can’t go thru another depressing year. point mental/educational/societal toll population starts outweight gains us got 2 shots: J&amp;J booster? say that, can't go last 18 months again, I've already lost everything. Thank you, agreed. 

We recruitment relationship work South African universities, years met really enjoyed SA grad students. Brilliant artists, storytellers amazing people across board. New policies last administration made financially impossible matriculate here, travel back forth became impossible, haven’t since Covid. 

I think time. Learned lot SA treated first thought news broke flight yesterday “this unfair, again” Nobody long enough know virulent.

Get third dose. point it’s feel-good measure win politician points little else value.   (+) Contagious
(-) Deadly

Please. ;( let give mild sniffles immunity forever.

I’m emotionally exhausted Covid. remember beginning, couldn’t take screenshot CovPass app. sometimes screenshot required travelling probably enabled again. Get line another. Hopefully time grab dinner Broadway show moving line.  South African doctor small sample size variant recently discovered. several weeks know much it.   matter? Exactly. Things getting back normal sudden pops up?

Give break. whole ""omg Covid scary, stop living lives"" thing overplayed point.

We new flu strains every year one bats eye. different.

I'm sorry, people die time one reason another. Get vaccinated live life. first pandemic last. 

If want kind hermit live fear that's fine, you. rest world this. honestly matter. guarantee it’s already here. Also, potentially long incubation time based single case really means nothing. Data come quick spreads tested. It’s like mutated bam, know it. It’s probably spreading weeks virtually 0 chance it’s already everywhere. exponential spread start short order regardless let don’t let in.  Given variant new, severe disease begun yet us know anything. say evades. said appears evade. take sentences context cherry-pick things people say order make look bad. actually said **might** possibly things, hinted location number mutations, far none proven. Gosh hope true. gonna potentially take seasonal job deliver packages UPS car. wonder new covid variant night make sense reconsider. I'm sure though. hope to. feel pain. I’m nervous hell. Oh goodness. Crazy. That’s amazing sequence virus parasite

So saying horse dewormer might work all? /s seen *every* VOC; Omicron 2x farther mutated other. 

We see individual mutations time, many common ones cropping repeatedly. individual mutations - changes one amino acid spike protein like E484K - drive contagious disease; takes multiple amino acid changes restructure protein ""still work"".

Every VOC different, popped multiple mutations common ancestor wildtype. conjecture VOC evolved entirely within single unvaccinated host persistent COVID, likely someone healthy immunocompromised.

As time gone there's steady upward ladder contagiousness. lineage mutate spread once, go anywhere contagious currently circulating variants. Every one ""most contagious variants yet"" total mutations previously seen variant: first D614G one mutation made huge difference, Alpha (9 spike mutations), Gamma (12 spike mutations), Delta (23 total mutations, though fewer spike mutations), Omicron (31 spike mutations).

This also happen cross-species jumps, though every pre-Omicron variant certainly evolved within humans.   everywhere now. would surprised US Canada well. I'm doctor, know. 

But already 4 versions Corona: Xi (original), Lamda, Delta, Omarion. **Frak** Fauci probably Chinese spy. Great, super spreader event. Get clue people! 10th least Getting mine tomorrow yo. Bidets good.

I love see touch poop. Funny first detected African country, clearly everywhere. think that's little embarrassing lockdown going happen, least US. Politicians can't realists, optimists. Someone commented suggesting someone ashamed comment yours. realistically, hold outs deniers, need die rest us move on. There's convincing forcing them, rational logical argument sway them.

The previous administration self-serving delusionists look well turned out. hoping variant turns less deadly less symptomatic. nervous hell though. 


If gotten original vaccine dose(s) + booster, hope. Till there's yet \*another\* vaccine Omicron etc etc etc. 300000 mutations.... it'll make virus \*less\* stable. 


The world can't handle another square 1. riots; economies crash. barely survived round 1. **If (*****Read again*****) IF** square 1, whole planet frakked. 


Humanity \*will\* survive...this ain't Airborne AIDS. happen, countries crumble. saw happened last time. see riots Europe. again, current Socio-Econ-Political order crumble.  Pretty much East Asia  early data suggests spreading extremely rapidly South Africa, literally became dominant strain around two weeks. Alpha Delta took lot longer achieve - specific mutations Omikron raised eyebrows based existing data antibody binding. 

Best case scenario causes asymptomatic infections mild symptoms really need worry much it. 

If work 'neutral' assumption ability put people hospitals previous ones combine rapid spread, would cause issues hospital capacities line - currently already limited parts world, eg. Europe. potentially worse scenarios.  


So makes sense look travel patters, tracking people might carriers (e.g. recent returns risk areas) follow testing monitoring weeks things get clarified. warmer months us sure November March since would go Cape Town that, really get anything close real cold (we barely get 0 winter) months pleasant. Gonna lockdown again. fun. person vaccinated? 10 year veteran ER nurse here: quit peaks. done.  “Should”, lol. Definitely East Asian life hack Well shows achieve. looking adults demographic time get shot. they've gotten one reasonable believe they'll get second least willing listen experts simply anti-vaxxers. comment considered high quality? vaccinated? serious question: person get Mr. Pentinnen’s position without experience/expertise/scientific background etc.?

It’s doubtful gains anything fear mongering harming personal credibility/reputation etc.

He remarking based knowledge, right? necessarily?

I’m asking honest questions. spectator this. Biontech expect results within 2 weeks tops absolutely not. I'm well beyond point giving hint shit ones willfully keeping us purgatory. still disregard whole ass country. Literal discrimination. capable rational thought?  tell SA department health chairperson early data cases mild.

This thing saying cases *milder*, claimed. Oh sweet summer child. idea broken Germany regards digitalization. systems Germany buerocratic limits almost always contain least one unnecessary analog step. ‘85 … money, freedom. 😂 meant regards vaccine preventing hospitalizations death 90%+ even 99% lot populations. prevent they're dying preventable deaths large. Best case scenario, Omicron highly contagious mild symptoms. so, it'll hopefully burn without much damage. going hold hope, though. Pretty much everything COVID related seems take worst case scenario route... ruled catching Belgium, either airport, that's either terrible expected news. ""nice try, liberals."" want visit South Africa see sharks eat seals. When's best time year that?  transformers robots disguise. info do. person asked immune compromised info.

Can link source everyone? point, honestly can't more, work healthcare much possible keep loved one's safe.

The virus parasite, infectious variant win hopefully less deadly. like common cold (another coronavirus) must deadly first emerged, became nuisance today.

Let's best stay safe hope virus become less deadly really quickly.  alcohol bans kick total one, absolutely horrendous everyone relies lively hood. bars, restaurants, liquor stores open ridiculous exports wines makes sense since literally leaving country.

I personally believe bans work, believe smoking ban place worked curfew place since last April anything either, government simply put place think help people mostly gone it.

Cases less 800 per day last 3-4 months country 65m people say treated way been, again. going football match go leave ? say funny, like seeing wild comments country 9 million big covid subreddit. Filght companies fucked sure can’t say sure it’s less lethal yet. Anecdotal information encouraging points efficacy vaccines asymptomatic cases, it’s way way way early know yet Yep. PCR detect variant. 

[Source Fun fact: provided disclaimer around first months pandemic game REAL THING.  People dying ""no reason."" dying human nature is. find way change that, let us know. Based people's solutions past, I'm sure cure involve something much unpleasant disease. 2-4 weeks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaccination. Doesn't. Prevent. Transmission. fact, barely reduces it, see example 

Your house hate, hysteria, discrimination built sand. sad. Omicron sounds like irrelevant unit measure (like milliliter something) Money. Newspapers? this, 2007? See thats good example. could train lay person move around bed avoid pressure ulcers fairly quickly. would reduce load nurses allow focus tasks. scientific consensus. early here. aim restrictions primarily prevent hopsitals overwhelmed.  hospitals put pressure, relatively serious illnesses need new wave restrictions.

And getting seriously ill large numbers therefore overwhelming hospitals largely unvaccinated. Depends timing evidence time. Also, know little political appetite lockdowns. know. even slow spread weeks Moderna Pfizer thing, could save lives. also ive seen news positive people hotel quarantine. im like, rest passengers tested negative? might test negative 2-5 days, theyve likely infected plane  little late lol. difference might self administered rapid antigen testing vs. Lab PCR.

S Africa best testing capabilities, travelers probably least possible able get out.

But alarm got sounded Dutch probably sent samples high sensitivity per testing. *Suprised Pikachu Face* don’t think that’s saying… think meant it’s hard fake negative test result, saying everyone tested boarded might accurate… mean look print find “PCR” negative somewhere form… Tests traveling $150 many places, people faking taken one unfortunately reality… Governments: “Don’t worry guys, we’re stopping flights Monday” keep complaining anti-vaxers suspect nation-level Covid solutions. long global travel breakthrough cases, doubtful “silver bullet” solutions skipped Nu, Xi, Pi Wouldn’t need account multiple rounds? 39 test positive disallowed, airline would want maximize occupancy 39 tested standby passengers would take place? Oh got judging even work travel much less necessary many us try avoid cost employers make take risk. issue really people aren’t happy it. disbelief travel fun have. Blows mind. Especially winter wave rolling in. caught south africa. almost cases omicron Michigan? Remember refused call pandemic months? also still reported Chinas numbers. ... LFTs range complete garbage can't even detect high viral loads, almost good PCR medium viral loads. 

Check study (out many) EU-approved tests 0% sensitivity high viral loads  thank I'm sure replied me, mean likely someone faked negative tedt l entire flight people ""tested negative"" 24 hours boarding. there's half flight full positive people Red one. Tell Andalusian economy. Israel found it, surely US already. imo... 

Medium confidence-- spreads much faster Delta current world.  
Its growth Gauteng fast. virus biologically relevant mutations increase transmission vivo spread. 

High confidence-- High antibody resistance. There's extensive literature different mutations interact antibodies use, Omicron lot them. 

Low confidence -- I'd guess although transmission risk reduced lot vaccination infection via Delta, might still provide good protection severe symptoms death. 

Low confidence -- know way estimate mortality rate immuno-naive people.. best guess probably Delta, maybe Beta instead? 

Low confidence -- longer infectious cycle lower viral load? Delta bit unique high viral load quick infectious cycle. SA health noted variant mutation associated higher viral load. believe Belgium person really long incubation period well. 

I feel pretty confident infect many people quickly, personally. think estimates severe disease is, lead severe endemic phase.  
Moving stocks around market opens though. variant must escaping rapid tests.

Even bad test taking reduced sensitivity caught those. clearly already spread everywhere, brace ""new cases detected area"" spammed next several weeks.

Ultimately, really matters whether becomes dominant strain, deadly is, resistant existing vaccines is. politicians health ministers say 'serious' actually mean it. real kicker. money isn’t fixing situation. It’s throwing money bottomless pit, situation continues, unabated. quality South African tests? “But people dumb” exactly said. also haven’t seen parents siblings almost 2 years now. dumb fully vaccinated travelling. Hold judgement Florida. It’s always Florida. That's works though, options ""spread"" ""no spread"". infected person expected infect one person banning travel hotspots slow spread, even already country. Everytime new variant pops up, Reddit acts like it’s March 2020. get cautious Jesus, calm bit?  Sorry getting link - http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-two-cases-of-omicron-variant-detected-in-uk-with-targeted-testing-to-be-rolled-out-in-affected-areas-12480213 COVID-19: Two cases Omicron variant detected UK - targeted testing rolled affected areas Yup. unknown number people flight took test well, testing positive, allowed.

Statistics difficult enough, inferring proper context like even challenging. That's dumbest thing read today I'm seeing sentiment anti-vaccination circles Omicron validation stance. see makes sense. better part year cases surged, vaccinated people faced far fewer complications fatalities COVID unvaccinated peers. That's achievement suggesting otherwise new variant emerges seems irresponsible. virus like 8 mutations receptor delta 50 total mutations seriously wanna see data UK 0 restrictions place atm, Omicron contagious said be, there's big chance already spread throughout UK rest Europe one horse leave barn better ten leave. point bans slow spread, eliminate really smart going south Africa.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Airline hubs. Everyone missing ""elective travel"" part comment. Family business way different traveling tourist.

I'm monster. Family important. Haha    Believe not, people spouses, children, parents, emergencies, etc world.  going Christmas shopping without mask on. So, strategy, favour mild variants virus. Vaccine perhaps thought such. need machines creating vaccines around globe need devise ways testing vaccines faster variant concern appears program machines produce vaccine variant quickly ""attenuate"" ""band"".

This pandemic might take decades there's plenty spectrum left. Everything I’ve seen says don’t know much variant. everyone shitting vaccine doesn’t work? true you’re assuming felt. know accepted possibilities lived lives. I’m point don’t think handle another long shutdown. that’s case idk, might move south something. I’ve done part far I’m fucking done this. Singapore. highest 'peak' ~160 cases population 5 million, we've begun exiting wave started late August saw us go 5000+ total population vaccinated even strict control measures. However difference also largely due well controlled situation prior wave. *2 days sounds article boss's family South Africa going home Thanksgiving see family. kept telling go, wait another year. wanted see family cause back since COVID. Boss stayed home. hope they're okay =\  Yet better believe gonna go platinum time, everyone getting it. Yeah. Everyone does. always get want life. Haha Omnicron sounds like going infect everyone (omni), cron reminds crown, corona. Unintentionally makes quite scary name. Believe not, people parents, spouses, children, businesses, etc across world I've read several articles tweets virologists scientists said combination ""first infected, vaccinated"" efficient protection.

I've infected 15 days ago, I've vaccinated (Pfizer second jab 6 months ago). I'm negative healed. young, fully health, fully vaccinated. I'd like know much protected getting virus likely might spread case ""First vaccinated, infected"" ? find data research case. That’s completely untrue. Bigly Please don’t. understand that. I'm thinking people know traveled Mexico lay beach, etc.

Seeing family lot important tourist. People like holidays. I'm UK almost everyone abandoned masks area, rare sight now. Everyone seems acting like corona over. Even staff outside vaccination centre wear them. Ay4.2.1 never became voc severe enough Delta called voc. necessarily always case new ones worse (some get added early discovered worrying mutations turn hype), knew confidence brand new variant performed well enough barely outcompete Alpha (with similar disease severity), well outcompeted Delta named point. Same, regardless age. I'm least 75% done shit   much nice HIPPA violation without consent patients Well mean obviously internal European flights going going ahead, high cases Europe.

So wrong flights South Africa lower cases us?  i'll let know  UK worst/longest surge since pandemic began enough this, unknown variant is?? OK, makes sense. 90.3% adults least one shot. Yup. That's honestly way left approach this- go back source problem. turn something that's political politics. Agreed, unless travel ban everyone, completely unnecessary. Israel Europe travel bans there, South Africa. likely already United States honest.

We careful 30 mutations spike protein, vaccine targeted, scientists concerned data yet show affect vaccinated people. ""Should"" masking 24/7 might actually overall net negative impact

No? No. public, interacting people, PANDEMIC... need mask. sucks, gets way, annoying... mean either wear fucking mask end increased spread, overwhelmed hospitals, people dying reason folks ""tired"" dealing this.

I really get it. do. sucks exhausting, answer give follow morons causing continued problems. ROI? found case Corona, fucken killed Pernil, red beans rice.  Saw something Pfizer shooting knowledge December 9. 

Several people new variant fully vaccinated, -- like variants -- pick vaccinated. Hoping -- like variants -- vaccine effective sever illness. Infection rate COVID act Florida starting climb chart ... guess people indoors cooler weather getting more. I've seen lot news repeat words ""more contagius deadlier variant"" without proof study claiming mean another shot? :(  knew strategy would work would sharing everywhere. vaccines used attenuated whole virus good. it’s possible combination mRNA followed attenuated nasal vaccine might effective. believe someone studying now. time fine.   Fuck muppets It’s don’t make passports visas small 68% fully vaccinated total population. Person replying said least first dose adults. numbers accurate relevant discussion. sinced possibly March 2020 based lineage testing new variant. Mask wearing already normal Japan. Maybe consider messaging. Increase requirents travel (Fully vaccinated plus PCR done new variant taken account quarantined period PCR run ensure catch post test), something like that, people would take able anything all. 

As messaging stands basically SA big bad, making everything worse avoided costs. 101 degree fever solid 60 hours booster. baseline temp like 97.5, bad way. I'd take worse much protection get. first two shots zero reaction to, btw. even headache. Yeah I'll pretend nothing happening 🙄 cautious Stopping spread never possible. Minimizing initial rate spread could bought us weeks make educated decisions. would require travel restrictions EU, they're going that, especially right holidays. welcome spread away, Omicron. really hope less deadly Delta. South Africa currently turning away doses due lack demand.  “In Italy thirty years Borgias, warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed, produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, Renaissance. Switzerland, brotherly love, five hundred years democracy peace, produce? cuckoo clock.”

(just bants) Already uk probably long till gets USA Time things… forgot rest Why… stop flights immediately? couple confounding factors comparing different countries:

1. Countries can't afford many vaccines usually can't afford much testing either.
2. Countries can't afford many vaccines (or high levels vaccine scepticism) may higher levels immunity infection due earlier outbreaks.  yes, see kids. One 17 left room year. asthmatic think felt vulnerable. Since got double vaccinated stepping actually got job. packing supermarket shelves happier. Oh look, thing told going happen happened! dare fear monger us.

Seriously much disbelief go school, study virology. cleared n things thought already covid existed XD right, we're pandemic, think totally realistic concerned. astonishing clear, sensible, particularly distinguished memorable statement like makes strong contrast kinds utterances subjected year ago. Decent number people sick again, tho. Half cousins ended quarantining Thanksgiving literally everywhere, incredibly common meme. know origin. - slightly - older platform used contexts before, perhaps that's came from. *cells smarter*   tell panic, that’s RUN. nobody authority desire research listened worldwide, even nationwide US. Additionally, measuring essentially impossible presence vaccines: include vaccinated unvaccinated cases breakthrough infections greatly drag measured IFR, separate bringing strong correlation vaccination risk factors.

There lot research comparing Delta (mosty) Alpha trying deal this. consensus significantly lethal; may best source. also find CFR numbers [UK surveillance published regularly. Immunocompromised could otger reasons, apparently person survived long time still alive, meaning isnt lethal? people dying reason still world can't change fix it. Plenty politicians scientists said immunity would last long, please don’t whitewash them. 

After revaccination banned taking another vaccine half year: way buy another one privately. spend next chance ineffective outdated vaccine.

I care long-term effects too, deaths. covid, one friend mine problems hypertonia (she vaccinated couple months getting ill), another one nearly lost ability read result micro-stroke. alive, many times able get it? Three? Five? 

We fooled current approach vaccination, time admit make something effective. currently however U.K. change rules requiring face masks Yes. Get booster! Good luck. never gone mainstream. clear, mean NY going enter lockdown. done make sure hospitals adequate resources case hospitalizations surge. Lol basically threatening put fire one time, going start another one? C'mon.

Republicans show anyone choice. showed morons absolutely bury heads sand rest society bends backwards try die lose anyone love. answer join republicans, hold responsible misinformation politicized bullshit spew. Given many cases found every day moment - e.g. 61 Dutch passengers two flights SA turn carry Omikron - we'll first set data symptomatic infection two weeks so, solid report take longer. even close sure, Also almost certainly lowest country now. They’ve status weeks. international flights, domestic, legally speaking. Interstate trace huge problem pandemic federal government able much states refuse even minimal guidelines website skews anti-social, people can't comprehend masking 24/7 might actually overall net negative impact, even middle pandemic. sounds like mean hope people will, they're predicting will, makes sense. Days weeks.

There analysis ongoing already whatever data however many people infected/hospitalized etc 

But need virus play out, (hopefully) days/weeks needs put people hospital (yet) Germany 400k deaths US. decade short, think answer never travel outside city ever again. risky see world. get VR headset stay home never get infected. Problem solved True. mid twenties. everyone American. country started vaccination later US got second shot late August. Therefore can't get booster late February. Cause wait least 6 months 5 risk group. weird way type it. omi? True also j&amp;j it’s moot point you’re serious protecting family. right using scare people away vaccines deny science.

The left using justify panic clicks views

We're fucked mean, I’d like see mandatory quarantine incubation period, followed test “leave” many would fit that, even someone moderate/slightly left even uncomfortable that. would better keeping plane. Damn. Sucks.  bother. im voted zero. fun now... spur them, won't.  Who's going enforce isolation can't infect people way home He/she survived though, correct? That's problem though. everyone vaccinated? Maybe I'm jaded I'm US everyone making mad. Haha those?  need worry long keep getting boosters! Well, suggest then? saying ""its already everywhere"" like giving up. must take kind measures. Life goes on. level brainwashing stubborn defiance scary. People rational creatures. feel like past years eye opening. extent though admit Florida gives evidence restrictions marginal affects overall numbers. Florida least amount restrictions one oldest populations, yet still fall within range states Covid numbers. Get vaccinated protect yourself, government intervention isn’t that. high net worth individuals hold wealth equities (stocks) real estate. COVID hit 2020, lockdowns, needed stimulus prevent economy imploding, Federal Reserve (our central bank) printed hundreds billions dollars disbursed economy, causing stock markets real estate markets increase extremely fast. means people hold assets became wealthier. Everybody hold investments can. Take money every month throw S&amp;P 500 index fund can. safe outside, socially distanced gatherings - keep 6 feet apart

You kept up. Search MIT sneeze study. believe me. 21 feet. practical therefore risk outdoors real wear mask. think combo delta hitting right around vaccines waning lot people. Yeah, that’s literally mild case. thought shown incredibly poor research? won't. still flying Monday. dont people tested upon landing US? Vaxxed tested international flights? there's not, everything available public right seems like speculation unnecessary fear mongering. vaccinated, mask keep living. TBF ton vaccinated people still gotten infected covid tell governments that. think it’s high time leave behind people aren’t getting vaccinated, fully open everything. also make law, you’re vaccinated you’re entitled hospital treatment Covid. Thank much these! Gauteng definitely epicenter here. live. ... see days.

Oof, must rough; stay safe hope goes well! guess still using Trump methodology ""don't test, can't know"". absurd, countries testing anyone getting flight SA goddamn US sits thumb ass. Yes. They’re lot less likely average person. Definitely. moreso past couple weeks. think need time understand impact new variant. parts country antibody tests seem indicate 80% population already covid. wonder much impact may natural immunity vaccination uptake low. 

So much country rural limited access Healthcare services. people locally deal dead without testing therefore without covid notification. It’s pronunciation difficult (not pronounced anything like Xi leader China). Might why. two flights.  put people flight area thousand people flights. social distancing masks apparently. like we've learned nothing. Oh new variant end nigh!!!let’s panic forget month like last one…🤦🏻‍♂️🙄    Yes, think within weeks we’ll pretty good sense generally problematic simply bad enough obvious even carefully curated data. saw article another sub entire yard full robot trucks Colorado. one picks up, go him.  rapid antigen tests rubbish. That's basically it, terrible detecting virus unless viral count people quite high.  what? Exercising democratic right protest? Australia nearly 90% vaccinated, huge number people support vaccine passports mandates vaccinated themselves. laws affront Australian way life, *hate groups* like Victorian Bar Association maybe time take moment pause extreme authoritarian shit government's trying pass guise ""public health""

As stands conservative side politics far vaccinated left. rains jump pool get wet. understand point comparison. People really freaking new variant, they're freaking possibility new lockdowns restrictions even vaccinated people. tv expert interview, said minimal impact, maybe changing spike US 7-10 days.

Still, early days new strain, may helpful. Yeah, people got plane it. People contracted plane wouldn’t immediately tested positive it. it’s gonna much worse. layman think viruses choose evade vaccine defence afaik brains think. would assume sheer number errors happen genetic code virus replicates, chance mutation circumvents defenses occur.

This would mean amount virus existence factor creation vaccine evading mutations far know vaccines reduce amount replications spread work new mutations. numbers grow astronomical amount mutations vaccine may ultimately evaded.

My brains say vaccine attenuates certain ""band"" mutations spectrum possible mutations virus infect humans (enter receptor). virus cannot return vaccinated band mutations dead end, vaccine drive virus band either. jumps randomly.

Once virus randomly enters band vaccine less effective course spreads there's nothing preventing could happen also without vaccines. possible bands locked virus available spectrum jump into.

I would also like theorize time virus generated gazillions variants, weaker others, weaker variants might circulate freely act natural vaccination bands ultimately replacing serious forms, behaviour deaths one kind band filter too, favours evolution towards milder disease.

However, sometimes milder variants may evolve backwards deadly, see influenza. Maybe travel ban kind bounty system countries get aid award discover new important variant help offset travel ban. South Africa's excess death numbers far worse official COVID numbers. cases found 10 days mandatory reentry quarantine. found via daily/every day testing. Neither became symptomatic. vaccine leads asymptomatic/mild disease, still working.  Guys need assume Omicron every city even Boring Ass Rural City, USA. 

Wear N95 masks next 14
Days wait get full report exactly variant compared others. Get booster shots love HeySeus, aren’t vaccinated, don’t know say you. ""Delta, United revising South Africa flights amid Omicron variant concerns""

We're fucked again, time appropriate panic vaccinated people start die covid exact rates unvaccinated people. Buy high sell low Yay silver lining I’m happy situations (willfully) unvaccinated people get plane / concert hall / etc. 48-hour-old antigen test. story makes crystal clear rapid antigen tests snapshot *that instant’s* probable infectiousness indication one free stealthily replicating infection. mutations spike, think would make sense spike vaccine actually works even better ever now- get boosters! Take easy Starscream. barely test South Africa, 30,000 tests done yesterday feel 65535? I’m mainly worried spread long covid variant. Hoping get data long covid omicron soon. They're conspiracy minded. [overmutation delta variant many European countries far? 4? Measles unique virus getting natural immunity wipes natural immunity everything already go again. Good news would data points analysis. Ah great Netherlands, well speak guys december 2022 past weeks flights South Africa scheduled.

The flight ban sensible, variant already spread present world now.  Netherlands airplane case shows CDC relying countries collect data understand virus , even going try test analyze people flew South Africa US past couple days?  find hard believe many people would board plane knowing sick.

It’s almost people put needs desires others’ safety well-being. 

Tell me: dropping several hundred dollars flight another country started feel little “off”, would cancel flight risk losing money?

I guarantee wouldn’t. 

Quit false righteousness. People dumb. learn late. Eerie county NY re-instituted mask mandate 4 phase plan ramping restrictions certain benchmarks cases. publishes daily data really point

Also check Ridhwaan's work: two find lot looking for. 

Gauteng definitely epicenter here. live. suspect black Friday sales yesterday prove escalate volatile situation badly... see days. That's fine people gonna need live consequences blame politicians. work US company Florida. colleagues got COVID vaccinated still brain lag loss smell heavy breathing etc deal with. Mortality rate? Bad news Covid destined endemic get go. many animal reservoirs go away. Pennsylvania, deer infected now.

Good news would this. Studying 1890 pandemic led likely causative agent last coronavirus make leap humans global level. Eventually, pandemics end virus mutates common variant mild illness, aka ""common cold"" worst flu (like avian H1N1 did). 1890 pandemic likely led one current 4 endemic mild coronavirus es. manageable. would great highly infectious variant causes extremely mild illness produced good, normal immune response. essentially would signal pandemic phase ending progression less severe endemic stage. Oh yee gotchu fosho   weeks since I've writing subs (honestly)

What's going omicron? delta 2.0 unvaxxed something like alpha all?

Is anything actually concerned boosted? Wonder surge Michigan due Omicron Keep mind vaccination rates Melbourne Sydney eligible population, Brisbane seen total 3 deaths entire duration pandemic. won’t need much… Seems like like better option area - schools daycares remained closed, bars clubs could open (pre-vaccine). don’t want bar club employees suffer, either, it’s just... Interesting priorities. said it’s hard believe people would board plane sick, dad’s Thanksgiving kid (16y/o) came sickly… Coughing, sniffling… gross. People making jokes it, old non vaccinated people didn’t care. even said, “I think covid.”

I noped fuck really quick, point is, people really fucking stupid. ah ok, cool. Definitely I'm calling spelling mistakes lol best way handle view hope best prepare worst type deal there’s way certain anything get genetic sequencing done lab tests done definitely measure variant actually capable vaccines. death hospitalization covid vaccines still good even 6 months tho, people. March 2020 unrealistically pessimistic suggest we’d still situation 2022, end sight. Nothing given anymore, 2019 levels normal gone. always dreams european vacation. realize that’s pipe dream, I’m probably better stay USA. I'll get home office ready guess.  travellers arriving Australia South Africa, Lesotho, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia, Eswatini, Malawi, Seychelles 14 day period arrival must enter hotel quarantine 14 days.
This irrespective traveller's vaccination status.
Both NSW Victoria taking one step announcing fully vaccinated travellers overseas country two week period arrival must travel directly place residence accommodation isolate 72 hours makes sense. generalized anxiety one strategies always think future events positive focus those. can't nothing certain. scary really impressed I've kept together long. know it’s rhetorical, Idk anything industry ask you—as politely possible— point was? Time end fiction virus doesnt spread planes.  Planes natural incubators. People packed shoulder shoulder poor air circulation. think point wooshed right head. fact find points ""asinine"" really germane whether points may true not. mean, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS said found upgraded passengers difficult. you, flight attendants. 

and comment alcohol back classes - perhaps, article written early summer. funniest part seem drawn conclusion author did: airlines likely kept alcohol first possibly business class important bottom line. Nothing “sus” people scared. People like trying sniff conspiracy theories exist entire reason got point. many lockdowns want, many takes stop virus. “... still probably 30% ppl wearing mask mouth. Dutch authorities enforcing. We’re unventilated room hour 12, breathing other,” added.

“After time maskless yellers unventilated space – shall see next days bring.” need declare emergency unlock certain federal funding. It’s technical thing. Maybe Victorians they're around 1k cases day, state (NSW) we're sitting around 200 cases day 92% vaxx rate Tho, sweden, increase protective measures like social distancing weakened immune systems making things like RS virus explode causing lot problems. 2 sides coin. Obviously needed covid worse might problem continues future. many symptomatic? many pre-symptomatic. know latter people contagious. I’m really seeing enough wether people testing positive variant getting sick.  still use toilet paper. far less dry yourself. I'm you. 

It's tiring anxiety inducing infuriating try try try yet stop. 

But take solace fact right thing thank it. one good ones. Invest make shit ton travel years.

The bacchanalia around world done … impressive Yeah, trying imply ""making everything else worse"" part. realistic way deal things, frankly, neither full lockdowns point unless things bad enough people dying streets, unlikely happen countries unless get hit bad India Delta. Congratulations! thank you. That's one possibility.

Or

Different strain detected/reacts differently tests

Or

douchebaggery people

Or

Combination three nothingburger. Stop schizo go out. got booster shot Tuesday. Arm sore day half. mild headache anc chills hours. it. Symptoms mild anticipated. Booster shots worth it. think many poor countries rife corruption people pay false negative test results. Agree. least two infection Hong Kong vaccinated. Also, top medical official South Africa called tempest teacup indicated flight bans premature. Hours later, reported variant already several countries Asia, Middle East, europe. Racist much uneducated pointed out, wrong cron, Hence **Alpha** **Omega** = **beginning** **end**

Does guy even *god*? Moderator *they could not* end life, lucky die.

Are unlucky people immortal? human history, normal. Oh-me-kron read again. many ""mays"" count? I'm guessing people literate Greek alphabet. thankful name Omega. always ways world getting worse. also ways getting better.

Compared even 1980s (let alone 1950s) made massive strides racism sexism, gone homosexuality illegal recognizing gay marriage, computers internet made education information available scale would unimaginable past.

The present definitely comes forms suck, past sucked too. think Omicron weapon DPS summarized game Avorion.

Which also fitting. know variant tested positive.  heard 11 pm virus particularly deadly Interestingly someone Times radio said SA one countries pushing lifting patents. two things add course, baby Toyota. Seems unlikely 85 infected people flight 600 got negative test result less 24h getting plane... I'm sure deliberately use Omega. Alpha Omega. Shudder. hypothesis would assume open without protective measures outcome short term would look bad. However longer time frame see immune system improve rather quickly humans around globe.

If healthy, rarely get 1 flu flu season, even though several strains, improved immunity right after,, following winter however likely get infected again, body seen flu virus while. 

Isolation COVID like taking break makes body think longer needs protection. 
A side note also able isolate lot countries around world, people could keep show going reinfect us we're open new deadly strain ( see virus linked article op's post)

Now body keeps bombarded different strains immune system certain point get strong enough, covid would longer infect short mid term. everyone could get stage knows might happen. like think possible current strains super easily transmitted. also worth noticing isolation prevents immune system adapting virus humans survived shitton pandemics throughout history. 30% DNA served purpose adapting virus (Link 1). Research points towards mRNA vaccines make changes immune system. (Link 2)

The luck approach (genetic entropy) (link 3) work isolate preventing strains dying out. might mutate less deadly variant later mutate deadly variant again. see previous post one sources state reason COVID virus mutate slower rna viruses, ability correct errors mutation, would lead genetic entropy. 
The flu never stopped exposed months year. Vaccines probably work either covid mutates quickly meaning vaccines favors strain immune vaccine.

Long term solutions never popular, see time politicians rather pick solution increases popularity (read short term solutions). 

TL;DR
COVID go away allow immune systems adapt response covid. Isolation opposite, one could argue like pissing pants, nice warm first soon cold piss feel like point one learned lesson overdo precautions sort incoming data later, going long 2022. longer incubation times make sense. Delta outcompeted variants could spread fast lowly vaccinated populations, enough people become immune/resistant variant long incubation times easily get testing procedures get unvaccinated. happened end November 2019. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Tacoma it’s bit joke, two coworkers wear mesh masks. Last checked Delta still problem. Trump… really wish born UK.. Would changed everything..

I seeing better days country better hang rather hang there.. South Africa, plenty vaccines, 30% fully vaccinated. Many take it. know rest Africa though. Perfect time virus spread. hard beat feeling squeaky clean ass right taco bell deposit. bidet never chance going back. Makes really rough use bathroom without one wrong. Parts germany lockdown calls emerge whole germany be. International health organizations keep repeating importance NPIs. UK triaging, 45 dont get ECMO several patients died emergency cars outside hospitals waiting hours treatment. Yes NYT reporter lol probably investigate origin tests.

Could falsified tests, could tester really testing labeling negative, could bad equipment. No, impacted mental health much can't get back restart career.. Yup.. Lockdown lockdown lockdown.. Even vaccinations full swing.. long possibly keep economy shut?  Let's see. pandemic want know get trapped, total strangers, box 10 hours. right? important keep mind many South Africa already infected delta variant, high level natural immunity delta. Omicron seems ""ignore"" natural immunity (at least level), easier Omicron spread SA. 4x may true regions level natural immunity delta high SA. also possible vaccine immunity works much better Omicron natural immunity, countries high vaccination rates, Omicron may able spread fast SA.  EDIT: Everyone tested rapid test less 24 hours departure.

I’m going hazard complete unsubstantiated guess: passengers faked test results getting test within 24 hours could hassle and/or expensive depending location (I idea South Africa) Well still young like (25), still painfully long time go death..  🐑🐑🐑🐑🐑 though? every positive test get analyzed sequenced identify specific strain? Plus, lot risk people already dead. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Yes. think probably infected. never test positive due resistance perhaps. can't put everybody hotel 600 day. battle already lost, pretty much. Also, 24+ hours make lot difference terms test positivity late.. damage already done irreversible.. 0.6475% 8 billion people died Covid 19 2+ years long seen epidemiologists three-year pandemic. 

There humans ever, Covid made small dent *growth* population. Okay. Apologies right place ask - thing occupying mind. I'm meant go UK (from Australia) week 2 weeks... already fence even less sure. Thoughts things consider?! know people act like panic buying huge issue. people bought way much shit pictures posted real issue grocery stores order enough things meet usual demand, everybody decided buy twice much usual reduce trips store. perfectly normal advised thing do. everybody half us get shopping thing runs out. That's shelves empty. one knows.  plenty speculation, one knows. Yes.. Sleep time feel pain.. want sleep forever yet... would argue part reason we’re seeing proactive response many governments also heavily criticised slow react Delta became widespread. better safe sorry. saving Xi last powerful humanity destroyer. Would want make wimpy variant him. get argument make could true, believe unlikely. 

Their case count went low 70 per day. Omicron would lucky super spreader event Delta get partake in.  
I think that's enough evidence own, Omicron around twice many spike mutations previous leader pandemic, many mutations well studied understood impactful, seems like there's legitimate reason  believe could advantage.  
When something distinct immediately creates wave area successfully controlling Delta 3 months, wave becomes increasingly composed brand new variant rather old established one, really think odds heavily favor blind luck helping Omicron out.

The growth cases also happening faster Beta Delta wave caused originally. think that's strong evidence, another piece. Get booster worry new variant later. Delta still real there's evidence booster protect new variant.  No. accurate. It’s tiny sample. 24% vaccination rate little/no delta plus low cases. didn’t make claim contrary. said would likely mutate spread among many hosts, pointed spreads among far larger amount people UK south africa. mean, sounds like next super contagious variant already here. maybe? enough vaccinated SA matter. think 60 people flight infected suggests South Africa horribly undercounting COVID rates unless want buy thought people represented 1% South African COVID cases? huge number mutations particular variation. SA punished excellent sequencing procedures. remember plague island? Kent variant? get car accident icu beds entire state, half healthcare workforce left bedside due poor treatment/ptsd, half somehow still standing dealing 8th Covid wave whatever. 

That’s issue. Even don’t get bad Covid, healthcare system still pretty much state slow collapse. I’m surprised places, German Health Care vaccination system unified one system. think prepared this. Even people areas generally strict restrictions it. general sentiment Massachusetts is, ""oh well, get care anymore."" exactly, wellness programs let employer offer discount everyone baseline must charged same. example everyone charged 300 month insurance, vaccinated wellness program get 50 discount. exception smokers charged double Vaccine protect getting sick, catching it.  toilet paper people like happens actually would consider smiling someone put gun head ended misery already American, guess I've gotten used distrusting people assuming one going right thing last years. city live pretty well masking, go 15 miles one wearing mask, case rates ridiculous, vaccination rates abysmal.

Maybe folks travel safely, want fellow Americans it. Haha you’re seeing right sensationalism. There’s firm data omicron actually dangerous delta. Keep eye it, otherwise don’t concerned yet. really getting hysterical. whole lot distance ""variant concern found"" lockdown needed. idea much impacts immunity, mortality, transmission. None. whole lot questions shut society.

It's societal equivalent prevantative chemotherapy. South Africa’s vaccination rate garbage, doesn’t need bypass vaccines, spread efficiently.  politics. % samples sequenced? I’ve started therapy don’t feel like there’s point since everything bleak Also think UK lot sequencing, would pick soon?  literally said “growing children reason travel.” Again, glad police constitutes essential travel. antigen rapid tests inaccurate asymptomatic disease. however accurate infectious quantities virus, time testing. supposedly super long incubation period could play guess? thoughts exactly. already ocd, panic disorder severe anxiety depression, came try get good news I’m feeling worse China quarantine everyone. days. People test negative multiple times, days, test positive.

In example negative tests means infected... days ago got plane. used credible uses credentials spread fear daily covid. wasn’t self administered test, wouldn’t result “inconclusive?” inconclusive result said one protein detected other. understand. wellness program allows employer raise health insurance premiums unvaccinated. understanding generally already covid would severe reaction *first* dose That's spread works R rates. correct cannot stopped, average speed spread key. R rate 2, means 1 infected gives 2 others (and on). 10 once, means 20, 40 etc gets harder harder contain.

We talking buying days weeks outbreak stage, may make difference. also allows leaders actually show leadership indifferent shrug upcoming deaths probably follow. UK million covid cases per month watch 24 year old friends daughter die alone hospital 16 niece get pots need wheelchair things might feel different. Also given 40% US won’t vaccinate knows happens it. point woods virus probably unlike it. Except variant country, local spread quickly going dominate spread travel. yYyyyYyyyYEBBbBbUT mAsk'S DorN'T worK vaRiAnt inNiT Good thing ban travel, enforce quarantine let people self determine find necessary travel. Thank this, literally panic attack comment helped reel in. really shouldn’t threads, thought maybe “good news” safe space get sort reassurance. can’t sleep, feeling unhinged. go SA Egypt 5-6 hours plane, likely enough people carrying variant European tourist would get close enough contact one get infected herself?

What conditions like airports visited? US airports filled restaurants full capacity, everyone eating right next other. Ditto flights. I'm Australian. live Portugal actually Couple months back Denmark testing arrivals. go line, get rapid antigen test, wait 15 mins results, allowed immigration. true - mix users contribute nothing conversation. Disproportionate, IMO. Eric fiegl ding

Do know credible is? Someone country trust quoting him, reading twitter tweets seem bit ""sensationalist"", still look credible. Don’t know you’re downvoted, it’s understandable frustration. Thank response. oxygen level currently fine. dropped 80s second dose wondering anyone else experienced this. I’m definitely going check doctor get booster. It’s little “not looking it” “not much it”. It’s definitely worldwide travel bans theater. It’s excessive use emojis makes want unalive makes variant dangerous multitude mutations already circling globe? I’m feeling like I’m missing something. people think *everything* confirms beliefs. thought-process. don’t mean alarmist can’t help wonder could huge mess given many people dragging feet getting booster. family got vaxxed 6-7 months ago I’m tired mentality. Sounds like could potential contagious delta. growing population states taking less less serious they’re it. Add anti vaccine people could really start popping 1-2 months. could aware infection, keeping secret travel country stronger medical facilities. case need go hospital. treat EU one boarder, anyone entering outside quarantined. Similar US.

We live virus reducing risk, incidentally reduces carbon emissions. can, should, use excuse reduce travel. Even enforcing quarantine would help reduce travel still allow people determine ""necessary"" own.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Swiss things. Oh man. pretty scary. 

If learned anything past, it’s always discover new variants late. 

Someone smarter information this, please say something make less scary. toddler can’t vaccinated yet. assume they’re made popcorn? Incredibly rude typed comment, 2 new variant cases found Britain. flight ban Africa nothing. It’s already everywhere. Yes everyone kept airport separated travellers results PCR tests came back. positive test results sequenced check distribution variants. Aaaaaaa selfish entitled Australians aaaaaa can't handle it.

You'd move heartbeat given chance mate. lie. top QR code almost never scanned here. People look second say ""alright come in"". It’s almost like joke beginning November. Indoor masking required seemed it. Dealers saw weren’t letting people sit without them. Shit. sure guys seen date spread global map yet. Reminds npc  Black humor I've got. Why? vaccine uptake high UK, seems far likely started somewhere spread among many hosts like South Africa vaccinated % low. makes sense mutations would likely spread highly vaccinated environment means variant breaks area would vaccine resistant. variant occurred isn’t high vaccine uptake environmental pressures evade vaccine chances mutating spreading lower.  ""singing"" beginning look lot like Fuck This!"" Damn feeling hopeful saw :( disagree, travel ban makes sense even variant already country. virus propagates like series family trees, generation infecting people last exponential way. Starting fewer initial infected persons means fewer ""family trees"" means time react. Possibly weeks. presupposes spread tied quantity infected people entering once. Folks envisioning like Normandy Invasion something, matters point it’s 10 10k people entering country. correct. point Omicron infectious (or more) Delta infected people slipped cracks South Africa identified strain major cities globally hitting businesses, riding public transit, dining out, going work, etc. doesn’t matter single bit plane load infected Botswanans landing Amsterdam. Uncontrolled spread already happening. Best thing robust testing travelers, quarantine needed hope like hell vaccines job. Panicking stage nothing harm. keep hearing test take (when another country flying home need test 3 days flight) get video call lab. watch take test etc . email result acceptable American government guidelines .. yet actually found it. going Costa Rica otherwise test day must airport 5 hours flight valid reason ever go back measures vaccines place, therapeutics way fact virus already wide spread.

You can't make definitive statements principle here. actual *consequences* bad enough measures need considered mind. 

Obviously little political societal willingness close anything again, things could get extremely bad equation change. probably nobody knows now. Get vaccinated, wear mask, go living normal life instead perpetual fear 

I mean imagine next super contagious variant comes 6 months. Everyone stay home next year? Poor countries distribution problem, money/quantity problem. truth that, also flaw democracy. country leaving borders open ""dangerous"" country whilst others close labelled bad leader heavily punished electorate.

This political scientific decision. say constant noise pollution chronic overwork good, New York seems like cool people, yes. Good thing don’t make rules Seriously. anyone source fo find info, please let know. Again: isn’t like Delta. long people keep getting PCR tests, Omnicron essentially loudly announces it’s arrival tests certain failure makes handing sequencing likely. It’s reason knew Alpha arrived early on: “S Gene dropout” occurs get one negative two positives. slow spread 61 600 passengers Amsterdam yesterday positive, plus positive cases countries opposite side Africa, there's next chance spreading already.

Even South Africa, fact would still let us citizens mandatory supervised quarantine means would eventually reach shores.

And even reasonable quarantine strategy countries already here, country isolated would eventually screw up, would get there.

The conceivable way keep Chinese style blanket, mandatory supervised quarantine arrivals. Even amount social control (and don't), struggled keep delta great cost.

I'm hoping less severe least unlikely reinfect/break vax protection. We're really awful winter not. wife fully vaccinated tested positive yesterday. Pretty sick fevers, extreme weakness, cough. wonder it’s new shit. Ah yes yes. expected bought us time crushed travel industry - 2 cases already detected Sure wellness program discount much data say opposite? known cases reported far asymptomatic sudden every country start reporting presence new variant.

Developing nations receiving end airport screening without doubt lax.I think within next fortnight almost countries would reporting it. I've repeatedly exposed covid, pre post-vaccination, never contracted far know, mean I've already it? way find that's case?

Both husband repeated exposures people who, pretty immediately after, discover covid time contracted location. One stayed home rode car symptomatic thought cold.

We live major city, use public transport, travelled internationally numerous times throughout pandemic, attended large music events indoors outdoors, bars, restaurants, house parties, gym, etc. etc. We've colds past two years tested negative time, even though tested numerous times each. live UK received second vaccination month half ago. incidents known exposure happened throughout pandemic, unvaccinated, half-vaccinated, fully vaccinated. time we're notified friend acquaintance, brace ourselves, absolutely *certain* going time get it... nothing ever happens, never test positive. 

Anecdotally, received Moderna incredibly severe side-effect reactions second dose, even episode tachycardia. Otherwise, we're mid-20s, visit gym daily, eat healthily, take vitamins. Requiring verifiable actually verification two different things. personal experience traveling internationally look printout looks official, says PCR negative exact passenger name accepted. hundreds thousands (?) testing centers worldwide simply scalable process verify results provider know legitimate, consequences.., case lot attention put travelers, millions travelers flew last Tuesday? one keeps test records… wish everyone would follow testing rules, worry many don’t take seriously cheat resulting spread deaths.., Idk things pretty good last months. Unfortunately IQ likes Germany Austria lower I'd hoped, see US-level vaccination rates.  flights vaccine requirements? old family friends mindset massive global conspiracy SA apartheid. think part problem massive distrust government due massive corruption vast mass misinformation keep reading spouting helping. Even advice uncle doctor UK ignored. recently travelled France Canada. needed negative PCR test within 72 hours flight. test taken Tuesday morning well within window get plane Thursday afternoon.

I’d prefer combination RA tests prior boarding take home RA test use within 24 hours handed arrival. think would less expensive everyone effective slowing monitoring spread. could worse Omicron several Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) mutations consistent enhanced transmissibility like N501Y, Q498R, S477N, K417N. also Furin Cleavage Site mutations like P681H consistent enhanced transmissibility. hope would mutations conflict decrease transmissibility. argue that, studies show immunocompromised patients develop many high-mutation lineages person, it’s likely transmissible lineage jumps new person starts spread.

Oh, variant also deletions spike positions 69-70, 143-145, 211. deletions known occur long-duration immunocompromised patients, deletions known reduce effectiveness neutralizing antibodies specifically act Spike N-Terminal Domain (NTD). (See ). What’s new deletions haven’t seen together before.

So possible Omicron highly transmissible. Indeed it’s probable scientists governments reacting like are. *could* turn not-so-transmissible reason, would take luck. surprised neighbor already I'm scared 'Omicron' either. fuck media. exist make scared get clicks. doomed captain mannering Definitely. Vaccination cause swelling like, that's harmful cross reactive dilation anyway. Yep! big reason even Delta able spread easily. People thinking bad, walking around maskless thinking everything fine dandy. Thank you. feel day lying bed weather worth decreased risk fatal infection.

Every country different honest every airport different enforcement.  also provides good level immunity process. Otherwise whole world might end perpetual cold I'm aware hoping current vaccines (and new pills) offer protection. worry yet another massive Covid Surge like Delta summer, time holiday season...again. bunch self absorbed narcissistic get simple vaccine.   Nah, Delta 13s pro premium buy vaccine holiday season youll get $800 right us!! Anything really possible. We've internationals Twickenham today Harlequins game. Major sporting events super spreader events steroids. almost definitely chronic infection, AIDs good guess, Africa pretty sure. really originate country good sequencing program that's surrounded countries awful sequencing programs, first got noticed? 

I think something find answer to. 

It's like A.30 came out, ever found travelers. Certain countries Africa black box. Yeah, missed goal killing half population. FDA doesn’t operate many countries. thought article indeed say skip 99% evaluation trials. I’ll see find it. Yes! symptoms long it? Omicron must really serious OK. Let explain think accurate information Covid variant.

It first sequenced 24th November. currently 28th. 4 days enough time people hospitalized covid complete full infection cycle.

If telling variant cause hospitalizations vaccinated individuals 4 days, I'll say ok, 5 days? normal infection cycle someone require high dependency care typically range 2 weeks (10-14 days). 

No one really time recover yet, can't say much anything outcomes \*because outcomes\* (yet).  Lockdowns (rather, stay home apart essential tasks) US always overwhelming healthcare systems.  30 mutations. 

Do data many would take render vaccine ineffective? 

Any data many sites protein vaccine tries hit?

Any data antibody vs. memory cell response?

If it, please share it, variant even begun escape boosted individual, reason vary data tells to, data point shows partial good protection likely none. brings back original question of: get travel again? point it’s little old you. people world probably interact with. refuse wear mask health officials say should, you’re putting people risk. 

Not caring welfare others sociopathic behavior. meant probably Lock gets bad. I'll continue diligent safety. vaccination low relative places like UK, that's assumption everyone practices guidance needed oh shit   go!  end day, matter what, vaccination derived immunity one massive advantage naturally acquired immunity: don’t need catch COVID get Captian Obvious entered room. long incorporated, plagues people too. Hopefully that's true, feel like we're probably still ""fog war"" stage variant, I'd wait solid data one.   nobody would traveling countries otherwise? realize aerosolized viruses extremely difficult mitigate transmission, right? Measles, small pox, flu, etc.  required checked. FYI, Israel currently voting fully closing borders. occurred wealthy nations horded vaccine supplies? interesting see omnicron cope lockdown - even works stop symptoms week 🥴 Thanks. We're assessing risk going international trip. countries we're going require negative PCR tests enter, obviously initial departure, expect infected get 1st country fine.

However, 11 hours plane would potentially vector, well public transportation indoor setting. catch something first country test positive, prevent us continuing itinerary. 

We wind quarantined hotel spending vacation time (or beyond) quarantined foreign country remaining flights gone. said 2nd country trying get home. 

We'll country 7 days, suppose possible possibly catch COVID-19 later still get back home. there's need yet, substantive difference delta virus replicates faster body, evade vaccine, means need booster sooner.   scared? stay home. yes, connecting hong kong china. hear ""china"" think mainland, assumed case resulted extended quarantines now. known variants thing.

It reckless travel unnecessarily pandemic. Fully vaccinated people dying though. anything, live next couple weeks, variant turns worse Delta 2022 gonna shitty. Wonder mask-wearing commonplace House Commons?   first time media absolutely unhelpful?! sure you’ve they’ve generally unhelpful quite awhile… Oh, agree world take it, suspect stupid stuff taking it, delay getting tested, etc, fall effective treatment window.

After googling, seems study claimed young boys myocarditis risk vaccination higher myocarditis risk infection ""deeply argument also irrelevant, right?

Yeah, that’s true, too. :-/ it’s we’re (still) situation. grows fast months much. People believe china government say covid effectively eradicated china china said Always take new news massive grain salt, hurt aware situation time dont overreact, still much learn new variant least good news, waiting see vaccine producers see everything updates people affected new variant doing? 

So far, I’ve seen news vaccine resilient enough new virus, nothing dangerous new variant Okay. I'll keep getting vaccines long they're needed. easy step protect others myself. Thanks help. Widespread uncontrolled HIV Yeah, last two years, feel like fazed bad news. Like, US west coast due major earthquake. May well happen now. number tests done though. need genetic sequencing distinguish covid variants.

It’s people like cause variant immune vaccine. stupid people believe lies Omnicron variant less severe, transmissible Delta, would great! One step becoming another one endemic colds. I’m getting booster tomorrow since I’m traveling Xmas. Good call.  doesn’t even lethal. could same, transmissible potential make efficacy rate current vaccines/acquired immunity drop 

So basically imagine first year pandemic, worse spreads easier/faster variants hardly protection prevent severe disease. 

If variant turn affect efficacy rate vaccines 50%… would HUGE setback. Vaccine hesitancy already high, many got it, believe it. would destroy public opinion, would even harder convince people take shots. 

I’ll still taking them, know many barely took vaccine… would view proof wasn’t worth it. could also fear scientific supporting governments. Especially quickest way everyone vaccinated. Fortunately vaccine antibodies polyclonal, target various parts spike protein, notably protein ""key"" cell entry.

What bad monoclonal antibody treatments. current vaccine still effective logistically make sense alter production focus Delta interrupting production, going likely true variant well. vaccines work maybe good OG corona enough doesnt make sense alter production.

Society still functioning normal problem data probably doesn’t exist. Sequencing takes money. RT-PCR takes money. quite short supply Africa. Note: I’m *not* blaming Africa poverty. However, would enlightened self-interest wealthier countries help Africa sequencing infrastructure.

Low apparent cases Africa may due two things: lack testing due insufficient resources, younger population age distribution resulting mild asymptomatic cases. virus still circulate evolve.

Are familiar lineage B.1.640 seems recently come Republic Congo spreading France? Omicron emerged week, thought B.1.640 next problem.   Maybe I've desensitized news new variants Omicron seems concerning, much worse compared ones before? God, need good news once. really hope catch break. hope doctors nurses especially! remembers time German ""expert"" tried write hit piece Twitter thread Chise ended deleting it? mention killing still vulnerable like elderly immune compromised. guess people care themselves. thing popping like mushrooms globe people saying people Southern Africa say like sniffles/cold. Thats it. Anyone know? everywhere would non wiser reported news. Ah see, thanks! possible, Omicron becomes dominant variant, would overtake Delta? maybe transmittable less lethal Delta? Nobody hasn’t cared going care way US citizens actually supervised, forced quarantine arriving back.

That would require country taken seriously point. Instead half-assed everything. :( simply say “ there’s new variant, it’s media scaring people” case, highly contagious, mild variant ends dominant helps usher us severe phase pandemic?  Loosened measures end September, since reproduction number steady 1.2. reproduction number (slightly) 1 similar measures summer probably due less ventilation colder weather. Also people tired measures follow much before.

Germany lived saw lot multiple countries, excluding like Croatia lol. see multiple reports SA saying they're positive vaccines still work preventing serious disease, 'based initial data cases South Africa'. data talking exactly?  Yes showed negative test get plane. 60 people positive. Seems like new strain transmissible. heard experts say 5x transmissible Delta variant. Yeah, might require us get artificial limbs time travel. (Thanks VLR reference) Yeah would put us 2000 deaths per day 300.000 infections per day Christmas. think let happen. Yeah, got 3rd Pfizer shot 2 weeks ago, bit unsettling. Hoping mine too.  US here. curious anyone knows briefing happened cause NY already declare state emergency? 

Or maybe I’m misunderstanding- NY already high case load they’re bracing Omicron?

Maybe I’ve seen much shady past year, I’m wondering going behind scenes. (Is everyone still watching Pelosi’s trades?)  ...Isaac Bogoch Canadian Belgium already released info situation report released November 26. reviewed last 250,000 PCR samples (which covered timeframe one month) found prevalence rate 2.2% deletion.

The majority low viral load didn’t view suspicious, small portion (47 samples) high viral load began increasing frequency last week month reviewed. Sydney Melbourne? Sigh. Buys TP pasta, puts sweat pants gets ready watch Tiger King. Deja Vu again. 10-14 days doubling rate Germany far know chnace Omicron responsible recent surge Europe? know loosening restrictions usually causes increase cases, sudden burst infection feels nowhere...

""Back normal"" slogans work anymore, current contracts outdated vaccines screwed too. words, current strategy already failed.

They two years develop working mechanism adapt vaccines new strains distribute really fast effectively. require negative test fly US?  should, lot syllables Omicron... impossible contain virus. impossible start impossible variants.

It way transmissible insufficiently lethal contain.

Nothing fundamentally changes, get vaccinated. Delta established everyone catching virus there's ""herd immunity"" it'll kill around 2% people get vaccinated. Nothing likely change much, small tweaks one way another percentage value.

And new variants every 6-12 months next 50 years. decide they're worth headlines more? It’s there. variant mutations variant now. outpaced delta South Africa speed earlier seen pandemic. Boutta go viral think meant less symptomatic ""very people need treated hospital it"". Serious question:

Do wipe using bidet?

I mean, instead smeared poo cheeks, like poo slushy?---- still need wipe, easier get poo out?

Sorry, I'm ignorant come bidets. problem contagious creates higher rates infection one turn brings opportunity mutation - want one getting deadlier.

it's imperative drastically reduce control infection load given population. talking mandating work, will?

Dart guns loaded J&amp;J.  surprising isn’t done quarantine HIV patients Covid. seem perfect host long term Covid mutations. Sticking head sand takes time gather data, Covid pandemic… smartest solution. See Jan-Aug 2020. calm down, pretending doesn’t exist doesn’t make exist. common cold isn’t caused another coronavirus.

Lemme guess. told places like Switzerland Finland communist hellholes brain literally allow accept measure better US nearly every metric. understanding since like May-June widely known thing; vaccinated immunity reliable natural immunity.

Was popular understanding? I've personally seen countless individuals including loved ones claim natural immunity meant need shot. Better articles acting like COVID: Sequel real question severe disease double vaccinated imo Also huge amount mid upper income international workers travel home holidays etc… far. anyone NHS reading this. masked up, washing hands etc avoiding big gatherings. seeing Christmas, unless ate many mince pies need stomach pumped.  place echo chamber. find vaccines personally political issue. vaccines effective, also potentially partially responsible mutations among things, need shot every 200 days? Look I'm anti Vax, far it. I've gotten every vaccine there. kids. 

But seem make logical sense. omi, what's next? Another variant needing another shot? find least little bit issue? fine i'll bite. think way, wish way. 'unfortunate' bit hung on, i'll try set like trolley problem hopefully grasp missing piece puzzle.

situation: X amount unvaxxed die reach 90% full vaccination status. something casually 

track 1: slowly. clog hospitals weeks/months/years. *incalculable amount vaxxed affected negatively (up death) due decisions unvaxxed.*

track 2: instantly. full herd immunity. hospitals suddenly liberated weight unvaxxed, etc etc.

honest question, understand application word 'unfortunate' scenario? give hint, italicized. Yes here! Three jabs n95!! Stay strong, friend. Stay strong. Also, people who've ""anti-vax"" social circles later started realize wrong want admit Nu excuse get vaccinated without admitting wrong...

FWIW get solid 12-18 hour fatigue muscle aches annual flu shot well. really 75% cases SA competing Delta, well truly fucked. vaccine MANDATES start?

The reason I'm asking thread certain disinformation sub shall named here. thread claims vaccine-induced myocarditis 50% mortality rate first 5 years. fully expect disinformation like everything else sub, since I'm medical expert myself, could use bit help it.

Here's got far. indeed evidence *viral* myocarditis carries long term patients diagnosed suspected acute myocarditis admitted hospital monitored hemodynamic instability. Immediate complications myocarditis include ventricular dysrhythmias, left ventricular aneurysm, CHF, dilated cardiomyopathy. mortality rate 20% 1 year 50% 5 years. Despite optimal medical management, overall mortality changed last 30 years.

source: assume huge difference myocarditis caused viral infection - like COVID-19 - myocarditis adverse effect vaccination. assume latter easily treatable significantly lower long-term risks. However, seem remember reading somewhere people 18 risk contracting myocarditis COVID-19 vaccination higher risk contracting myocarditis COVID-19 infection.

Can anybody help untangle bit? mean Delta Airlines linguistic gymnastics announcing handling Delta variant policy. Italy confirmed 5 cases COVID Omicron involving business traveler arrived Mozambique November 11. household transmission. 2 5 infected school-age children.

Why wearing mask suck big deal you? considered conversation therapist might helpful? Point 'omi' dumb. Transmissibility.

From *individual* perspective, care severity. bad catch it?

But *public health* perspective, transmissibility far important. Even severe average, it'll severe *some people*, 10x many people catching disease far worse, terms burden hospital system, disease getting severe.

(By comparison, measles 80-90% secondary attack rate.)

What true Omicron increasing roughly 5x per week Johannesburg Delta cases constant. means outcompeting Delta 5x per week.

People traveling year long held long could barring country locked I’ll going :) cheers yeah China last year largely successful shutting world. They’ve wearing mask since Spanish influenza. They’re going stop. It’s way life now. Sequencing isn’t easy process. deny, goal posts shifted new boogaloo variant, what’s give time? Extra coughs? 

I’ll happily carry normal, unvaccinated papers show Gestapo arrive. Nope, fully vaxed, husband getting booster next week (also getting flu shot im it, gon fun) couple days later kids getting second shot pfizer. family members care enough also fully vaxed already boostered. 

At point unvaccinated (with excpetion immunocompromised cannot get vaccine allergies) made bed. Worst case scenario get breakthrough case know likely mild one, die low chances getting long term effect.

I wear mask public required (indoor state) longer afraid. part? exceptional sequencing reporting soon reached significance? entitled western take. Currently Day 7 stuck parents' basement, positive test right came home Thanksgiving. really going isolate 10 days time every winter rest lives? seems like *eventually* move on, wear mask public otherwise go back normal life despite infections. going go away, random 10-day quarantines couple times year seem like unreasonable burden impose everyone forever. approach positive test vaccinated person mild symptoms look like in, say, 3 years? 5? 10? It’s alright, we’re lot stress. Don’t worry it. think lot people misinterpreted meaning; discouraged many people didn’t seem taking new variant seriously. thread, masking end Jan 2020, joke. Sending good vibes way, stay safe healthy.  are? ‘Xi’ used common last name

A common last name happens held leader great power. mean? Guys found Q one wants new variant spreading airport. LOL. ""Should"" ""will"" two different things. Well, said wonder sick vaccinated people getting. evades vaccine vaccinated people get super mild cases much smaller problem vaccinated people getting sick mutation dominant, highly transmissible also mild, symptom-wise? Meaning, could take version people catching it’s like Covid-Lite s

Covid vaccines specific spike feels like covid end like flu. new strain two five every year vaccine rushed made.  thing every variant concern. fast tracking booster omicron they’re saying could came it. They’ve done variants. It’s keep shareholders confident. much better knee-jerk straight extreme panic. variant already spread, there's nothing else besides wait data. Even worst case scenario lockdowns temporarily slow down. People really acting like lockdown restrictions way. god. People, isn’t new virus. Get vaccine, wear mask to. isn’t anything new different. hope next-generation vaccines robust ones have. imagine they’ll teach immune system target multiple proteins rather spike.  Happy holidays.

It’s rough. Like, really rough entire Thanksgiving dinner came can. Probably mRNA booster. 3 doses total. factually incorrect

No, isn't. See remainder post. 

*""South Africa first identify Omicron robust infectious disease research program (mostly HIV issue there), strain didn’t necessarily emerge there.""*

My point yet know increasing globally (where hotspots are), all, countries outside southern Africa started looking last (two?) days. Southern Africa appear Omicron elsewhere, also looking longer places. yet know certainty point origin, first identified. like yet know jump vaccines, yet know transmissible, deadly etc. Maybe cause concern, maybe not. Right whole lot speculation, little data. 

Until know actually going think ought careful things like travel bans, really going lot good anyway (and may active harm global cooperation virus response) Omicron already global (it is) transmissible Delta (open question, need data). cases Israel, England, Hong Kong, Germany places reported... shut travel places well? think proceed caution all, really know going on. two cents. logical worry/prepare worst there's proof. ends nothing harm, end bad least prepared. That's feel well. mass hysteria hand..... felt making good progress mental health end, even factoring winter waves. knows now. Honestly, outside reddit, feel like people done wanting enjoy holidays. people want remain doom chamber, guest I'm going live life past months South Africa. Would surprisingly easy pay someone test say did. country? Austria did, Netherlands also partially shut down. Sounds like want demean people J&amp;J March 2nd Pfizer mid-July. antibody test done couple weeks ago, high. I’ve fence get booster. think get now? “There new highly mutated virus might make vaccine less effective” isn’t strong argument getting vaccinated. surprised guys already it. reaction second dose sucked well. Knocked butt days, took week start feeling normal even muscle stamina reduced maybe week longer. 

So far booster Wednesday, sore shot spot, fluid collection lymph node armpit side annoying, fatigue general muscle aches, nowhere near bad second shot. Probably closer first shot. able spend good chunk Friday cleaning around house, including deep cleaning oven, took dog usual 3 mile walk. Florida may first *have* it, given lax everything doubt they'll first *detect* wish knee jerk reaction would strong arm Moderna Pfizer allow South Africa manufacture vaccines, they’ve begging time laws fully vaccinated (and recently boosted), going church every week. church plenty dumbass antivaxers. wear cloth masks. begging get KN95s they’re going keep going. cases detected gene dropout test PCR tests. likely running old tests now. cases it’s hard locate immediately notify public. baseless speculation. case already country going shut again, *especially* United States.

Ultimately decision live like reason sweat it, demanding everybody else forced live like indefinitely regardless vaccination status another thing entirely.  Wheres reaaally long gun shoot schools need it!?! that? :) might well lock home never leave point. I'm immunocompromised live area people care COVID. I've enough losing everything others selfish protect others, espeically new strain comes around. Gg Dont need tests vaccine certifucates travel internationallly? particularly helpful lacks context -- yes, Delta dominant SA. cases low SA Omnicron appeared, know would compete environment Delta rampant.  commented parallel, reasonably took time taking first sample realizing significance first sample. Whole genome sequencing takes significant time.

Even RT-PCR S-gene drop-out, could another Alpha case would far less alarming. That's accurate. Even serious covid cases start mild, virus highly transmissible initial stage.

With previous immunity, mild illness covid expected young person, old person. course would. also point. know little this. know evades vaccines. know infectious. know causes severe illness. Yet world freaking out, stock markets crashing, countries closing borders, etc. Delta spooked people lot went got vaccinated. Talked nurse yesterday got booster said they've super busy, live low vax state. Shits probably spread UK now. want go now?!  Zero chance, highly educated experts live bubble zero clue deep anti-vax / ""medical freedom"" crowd dug in. IMO, would take mandatory vaccination get vaxed going happen.  lambda dud start though thing, anybody saying otherwise convinved though ill give right. Though ways variant showed number cases - like Alpha Delta. Cases spiked, looked explanation found variant says mutations similar linked heightened transmissibility. also says variant harbors high number mutations regions spike protein antibodies recognize, potentially dampening potency. mutations look like likely contributing “further evasion,” hints computer modeling virus could dodge immunity conferred cells. People grew/hunted food back days. farms continue running trucks supermarkets?  Yeah it’s mandatory anywhere, advised  I'm still wondering US thought waiting good idea. Netherlands acted quickly shutdown travel found 61 people tested positive (don't know strain yet) South Africa. Sounds like going quarantine Amsterdam. Another big question, people get flight first place positive?? prevailing initial opinion medical community current vaccine's antibodies neutralize Omikron. However, cells generated current vaccines still able fight virus. would mean current vaccines reduced, still significant defense Omikron strain. countries actually reacting normally this. It’s South Africa part. people wearing masks shops public spaces etc? It’s bullshit Shit probably started went SA let’s real.   Almost certainly yes. need shutdown now. let things get control. fucking infuriating. Hope feel better 2007 great. dad still alive went first Burning Man. 10/10 would repeat…gimme dat time machine Get it. old variants still making people sick, don’t sleep Delta there’s hundred cases something new Bubba wreaking havoc across Europe! That's point. discovered asymptomatic mildly ill people traveling. means people getting tested traveling they're ill enough get tested land hospital. hospital Johannesburg fully vaccinated patients hospitalized

Funny there’s speculation omicron vaccine resistant, yet mention important detail UK.  really. precisely flu vaccine still provides plenty protection even strains vary greatly you’re exposed vs. vaccine. Nah. They’ll increase ivermectin intake  lol both.  Idk, think people wearing masks continue to, lot people know weird expressed they'd like continue practice. Personally, I'll probably always bring mask wherever least protect someone looks sick wear one.  I’m supposed travel U.S India work 14 days’ time. trip scheduled 11 days. I’m getting concerned go might get stuck there. one variant time?  agree. I’ve got family serious 2020 like “whatever time move on”. I’ve protected well can. It’s do. worry bad days ahead country might get bad enough consider stay home orders month like early 2020. know that’s last resort gets bad enough could happen.

this entirely accurate. PCR test picks viral RNA fragments, means pick virus dead alive. order prove there’s live, replicating virus, sample needs cultured see grows. PCR test alone won’t tell that. already motivated. experts seen memes Herman Cain awards zombies ""lining 67th booster 97th different variant...""? honesty probably get one friends get booster now. putting first two knocked bed week. might enough make schedule another week bed. probably people like affect tiny bit. rest us sitting wondering travel restrictions going work time work first time watching everybody scramble area spread world fast possible... that's said lol guess looking current vaccine prob efficient comes hospitalization death. Less contraction spread.  It’s basically nighttime lockdown, right? bars, restaurants, stores close 5pm. specialists already tell probably present day vaccines still useful, updates needed on, nightmare scenarios likely come. Hoping they're right.  China nothing wrong grand scheme maybe leave alone. world wide health community seems think so.  Thank you. travel bans useless. don’t even know variant originated South Africa, easily could another country region entirely. doesn’t matter. states like Florida (my home) Texas comply federal lockdown. However, that’s irrelevant biden call full lockdown country. Biden rich white dude anyone thinks cares peoples lives economy insanely naive. might better trump, end still care poll numbers economy much saving lives. Reason isn’t part analysis; evolution goal, all. virus outcompetes strains *happens be* less lethal, that’s scenario requires contagious/less lethal variant end pandemic keeping population de facto inoculated deadly / less contagious strains. think mean difficult get people take seriously people got got ill, even following asymptomatic contagious period. grain salt probably depends age, like illnesses.  Clearly circulating ages much worse terms breakthrough Delta.

Those unknowns people worried. Moderna test result couple weeks regarding vax Omi.....  look around see every governments reaction this. know something yet. go back point, even another country closer are. one put rule many times try improve life, try different things. every right try something feels right. friend quit 3 unis ages 18-23. started different one 33. think want friend unis?

Take care please seek support can. body chemistry whack pity feel better tune. …what fuck?  Yeah perhaps wait see vaccine even help new variant recommending something prevent it. we’re honest, never advocated *false* modesty. 

As rest, guess it’s time open /r/IAmVerySmartAndMyCountryIsSuperior It’s normal fact it’s change happened ancestors. Nobody took step back worry health like within past generations. Question (possibly dumb question):

Within virus potential mutations could cause devastation humans? 

Not already devastating, I'm curious potential something exponentially dangerous.

For example, realistic may, point, confronted version virus highly contagious, resistant modern vaccines, high mortality rate?

Or scenario impossible due physical limitations virus itself, improbable worth serious consideration?


I'm trying fear-monger, I'd really like know range realistic long-term outcomes. lot obese (and maybe old?) people compromised immune systems though. would like take back comments may made previously Government ahead curve one.

&amp;#x200B;

With way, guess hope whilst mutated alot,and clearly shown spread, mutated enough get past jabs, caused serious illness people. still unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

This however bring us back modern dilemma. UK Government give everyone booster, jabs sent third world nations prevent mutations. planes carrying 600 passengers South Africa landed Netherlands 61 people infected coronavirus, Dutch health authorities said Saturday halting flights several southern African countries fears new omicron variant virus.
Tracker: U.S. coronavirus cases, deaths tested airport, infections isolated hotel, regional Dutch health agency said. health body immediately respond request comment early Saturday whether omicron variant detected among positive samples, although said researchers racing make determination “as soon variant novel coronavirus scientists fear could transmissible delta variant, labeled “variant concern” World Health Organization Friday. first detected southern region Africa, cases started rising recent days.  See that’s lose me. fine masks social distancing vaccine, highly effective vaccine 90% vaccine rate, please take steps towards normalcy. Panic buying getting little wztra cases omicron popping we’re looking it. Unlikely UK found two people country tested positive it. 

Best bet omicron already relatively wide spread South Africa simply found first. 

Travel bans theatre point. 

Good news we’ve likely living omicron already didn’t know it. back normal!  misleading tag Good News? mean scientist world say know new variant vaccines here's politician SA saying vaccines work new one. Citation needed. spread misinformation. Oh I'm 100% certain reach ireland panic 100% facts sick actually makes people panic evey headline continue planned following normal health service guidelines change know soon enough... smart safe enjoy birthday meal :) happen anyways. Real growth cannot exponential long. Real growth rates form sigmoids.

Even now, look weekly growth trend (first derivative daily new infections) see dropping daily. 25% right 20% next week. true exponential growth, derivative would exponential well. 

If trend continues, see less steady state Christmas. would surprised see rates 20%, 15%, 10%, 5% coming weekends. Germany whole probably see incidence rates 800, half 300.000 new daily cases. 

If figure added booster vaccinations, able reach 1M/day, also expect 30% freshly immune population then. 

IMO much important find way treat expected 9k intensive care patients fabulate impractical potentially illegal lockdowns. predict Monday holiday wknd. agreed.  next 10 days crucial.  may get early indication sooner transmissible initial data suggested. would've preferred Kaiju instead fear too. mean sound like lifes old people matter, course do, kids getting severely ill would probably game changer... vacation part asshole move. life need vacation from, friends need one half assed learn nothing world travels.

They'll find first. death rate significantly risen South Africa government jack shit help companies, yeah PPP cool I’ve spoken plenty bar owners said another lockdown would close good. (This guy owned building ran bar 30+ years)

PPP isn’t enough you’re running bar DT LA Sam Francisco wherever. It’s drop bucket. many restaurants bars closed ever confident statement government didn’t anything all. know.  yes.  perplexing.  maybe poor testing centre…we UK. believe thing health minister, lax variant, said ""give weeks actually something country"" Wow that’s actually really good hear. don’t understand it, whatever. new information article? No. honest it’s contagious delta evades antibodies almost completely unmanageable…. Young average population, too. take pcr test go back home today, month ago Covid (negative test couldn’t smell taste shit). I’m vaccinated zero symptoms, chances testing positive PCR test? Unvaccinated Americans: *""I'll let give vaccine prick cold, dead corpse""* agree. get ride brother auto parts store yesterday. stopped two different liquor stores wears toy cloth mask jack shit. He's like ""I want n95, wear masks"". Ok cool buddy, makes literally zero sense I'm going anywhere walk instead. can’t honestly answer “when” able figure myself. ability consult doctor though please that. plan asking mine next week. Since still sick it, figure time. Best luck.  Wow, immune response issue? Nobody know day feeling moderately bad vaccine that’s around 200 people including coworkers family. 1 Week booster. Sitting restaurant. Fuck COVID Oh no. Anyways least one's feelings hurt mandates though. kids boarded time landed spread? pandemic going almost 2 years now. We've hard lockdowns half that. We've vaccinated everyone can. exactly international travel resume again?

Vaccinations end this. open mass vaccinations we're literally never going to. nothing else come improve situation vaccinations. Lol arent. Netherlands jack shit prevent things getting hand.  Yeah forsee lot ""just time holidays, gotta keep everyone control"" style messaging come antivax crowd. point, nothing convince refused get vaccinated far- they've made whole personality, change would break them. selfish stay home get family sick spread virus? advised cdc. Stay much possible, reduce trips store. buy usual?   buys bit time order days weeks.

These moves fully political. politician wants blamed trying it. (when) fails, least tried.

But, yes, almost entirely pointless. breakthrough Delta back September. I’ve since two rounds steroids, use inhaler around 3x day. I’m 31 (was) great shape. Sure, “mild”. matter going forward. disease going mutate becomes deadly large percentage population. air travel large percentage world's population unvaccinated covid continue evolve. Stupidity evolve, ask republican. Omicron concerns spur thousands experts understand anti-vaxxers going convinced latest variant.  really sad we've almost two years uni students stepped proper lecture hall (or even allows campus) weeks ago. go back home possibly finish degrees without ever really experienced uni life. 

At least sociologists psychologists new stuff publish about... That’s need stop watching mainstream media virus eventually runs immune naive people. circulates human population immune systems adapted fight it. game cat mouse comment completely top. top health officials think future.  need elaboration anything. sentence crystal clear. all. thought people *everywhere* sow negative test results boarding flight. rules lax places restricted others? Makes quite useless, no? Honesty way important false modesty.

And indeed, honesty begins acknowledging bolded part sentence **The Netherlands great many flaws opinion**, comparing United States like comparing Hendrik Lorentz Louie Gohmert.

Merely acknowledging superficial disclaimer ignoring thoroughly kicks chair underneath subsequent argument flaws acknowledged, simply dishonest. 

I merely need focus infrastructure intellect. 

I could write long jeremiad completely eviscerating United States instead, especially past six years, twenty, however want look it, *before* compare contrast superior country United States practically every single way. 

Now, recall OP mentioned smartness, highlighted point. would done well acknowledge that, too. 

Again, honesty important thing. guilty flattering much, problems escalate. 

The Dutch approach pandemic severe weak spots.

Yes, all. far I'm concerned, temporarily, ad infinitum. important thing is, you’re staying positive U.S.? Probably 2022 midterms. Check comparison speed variants spread hope true! (Not doubting saw heard). dad died covid last week someone Q-adjacent family secretly got vaccinated. least one got scared. put another room, would decent ventilation HEPA filters.

Why would assume would decent ventilation room?  Cuz it’s anagram moronic, elites taking piss us numb cause drops mean nothing decades. look lot people’s returns like 25 years horrible people worrying, timing etc etc. eventually lot say it’s rigged unpredictable. pretty predictable 20 year chunks. People want lot money QUICKLY understanding CD4 ""Helper"" cells. make antibodies, B cells. CD8 ""Killer"" cells. kill infected cells, directly attack virus. Detroit common layover airport... body people capability offer assistance non essential workers don’t fall behind bills provide family lockdown stop spread deadly virus. 

Oh wait….we  Hopefully want get ahead sequel overwhelmed hospitals. Hopefully see fully internalized airline propaganda. would rather aircraft everyone unmasked vaccinated, aircraft everyone masked vaccinated

Depends well masking enforced. masking actually strictly enforced real N95 equivalent masks required I'd rather plane unvaccinated masked people would put lower risk plane full vaccinated unmasked people. Though honestly I'd much rather place since risk plane full people vaccinated (actually wearing, spend hour eating bag peanuts) masked people would essentially zero risk. joke, largest joke, simply eat jokes?  vaccines widely available worst Delta. accurate comparison. 

I agree take new variant seriously, also alarmist. There's evidence vaccines ineffective Omicron. Yep. Way many people getting area gas station, check lanes, etc still feels like necessary precaution. Possibly year, since similar lineage sequenced full year ago. Yeesh. ""oh could've faked"" responses, experience lately,, bad actors pushing false narrative. mean disrespect whatsoever, many others US tired bullshit getting pushed favor fact. 

I appreciate input unique experience, frankly, makes even angry people put personal inconveniences health population. That's flat awful. new variant heavily mutated it’s possible could evade current vaccines (or least render significantly less effective). baseless speculation

I think everything is, point. Nobody bases, neither me, you, Fauci, South Africa. We're building base right now.  SA/NL requiring sort test fly? There's possibility variant giving false negative rapid antigen tests due changes Spike protein antigens. giving false negative Spike gene TaqPath PCR, genes testing positive. helps track without need time consuming gene sequencing. would vaccination status matter know vaccinated people still catch spread COVID? It’s small tiny percentage either. think you’re safe, safe infecting others, you’re vaccinated, you’re wrong. Vaccinated people absolutely contributing spread point. fully vaccinated start got COVID another fully vaccinated person. That’s uncommon thing lately. likely largest transfer wealth middle class rich recent history

Do sources, seeing many small business failed first year, insane people still advocating return lockdowns.

Do think lockdowns anything 'wealth transfer'? 

To honest, seeing death rates places lockdowns, places didn't, insane anybody advocating never, circumstances, lockdowns ...  omicron become dominant variant South Africa quickly  long omicron breaks china's ""zero covid"" strategy? think olympics danger happening schedule? Well, good are. got mine, wait told one who'd even asked week.  Yip. I've read Spanish flu hit 20-40 age becket badly. Yeah, COVID hits everyone differently. got pre-vaccine hit hard, like bad flu. even lose taste smell. Meanwhile someone know COVID time (different exposure) fucked taste months. much talk lockdowns indisputably good effective. know regular people need money eat? That’s whole thing works. Lockdowns eat core economy shutting lots production, it’s money. shortage actual things. things need weighed everyone thinks lockdowns somehow good thing everyday people. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  That's simply true. Even old people get serious infection. I'm sure cup water hands whole time. Which, per cease fire agreement signed COVID, makes okay. Markets plunged Friday, hope taming coronavirus dimmed new term entered pandemic lexicon: Omicron.

The Covid-19 variant emerged South Africa named 15th letter Greek alphabet.

The naming system, announced World Health Organization May, makes public communication variants easier less confusing, agency experts said.

For example, variant emerged India popularly known B.1.617.2. Rather, known Delta, fourth letter Greek alphabet. desire live fear, like understand what’s going world around me. correct Delta heightened transmissibility mutations, Omicron twice number “bad mutations” spike regions Delta did. Early modeling suggesting Omicron potential 500% transmissible Alpha, addition increased ability evade vaccine. Obviously nothing sure yet, know concerning heavy mutations fast spread South Africa, hence immediate global response. Probably imo. Likely somewhere Africa that's sequenced. 

It genetic variation different Omicron samples expect truly originated November. Likely around African country sequencing month more. South Africa first detect - knows could originated. Omicron doesn’t understand stock market bull run January nothing stops bull rally- move aside Omicron.  Precisely know. happy countries proactive. turns variant little extra concern better. question, admittedly knowledge biology 10th grade level 1960's, I'm expert means. know viruses mutate. Would possible two different viruses infect cell exchange genetic material? example, could COVID-19 virus infect cell also infected HIV virus? result, could hybrid HIV/COVID-19 virus? Thanks, please make feel dumb, honest question.    Yeah. Everytime family brings up, simply tell vaccines arent controversial extremely well understood branch science decades. simply arent political topic. Rapid test probably failing testing Spike protein, probably giving false negative due mutation.

The Spike giving false negative Taqpath PCR, gene drop helps track it. There's also reagents identify variants. wrong North America? Ontario still pretty aware, lot protocols really need variant triggers massive immune response young people, similar Spanish flu did. would nightmare incapacitating key workers. anti vax all, variant made actively pursue booster. I’ll need February (6 months), wait government it’s probably going mess (non-western country). I’m booking private hospital. Mu Lambda outcompete Delta, actually strong evidence outcompeted Delta time designation.

Omicron evidence outcompeting Delta, evidence outcompeted Delta. 

Its spike protein also much unique variant's far. serious? vaccine doesn’t provide immunity, vaccinated people still spread COVID, are. Traveling leisure global pandemic moronic.

At least, full mask mandates effect globally, regardless vaccination status. mention always selective pressure variant kills one infects everyone. Now, selective pressure extremely low COVID due incubation time, still there. timing market. shown again. I’ve made 10x wealth last 20 years friends always “thinking” that, calculating random nonsense don’t understand, reading headlines, getting in, getting etc. isn’t fast pretty predictable long cycles. Sure person luck onto big bonanzas 9 10 lose big miss gains hopeful this. studying virus since February 2020. knew CDC's recommendation could stop wearing masks fully vaccinated completely reckless. Europe going Delta matter time. removed masks, would fight get back. 

Now Delta putting strain healthcare system people still refuse wear masks gather holidays. 

Everyone seems think pandemic over. Even Biden blew $1 trillion infrastructure. Omicron hard see stimulus package already spent $1 trillion dealing rising inflation. Single data point single data point, man brought Hong Kong was, believe stayed, asymptomatic. caught PCR testing routine quarantine travel. 2-dosed Pfizer, boosted. saying last two things certainty experts even claiming right now. idea less deadly enough time passed. Also, thread right there, someone smarter you, surmises actually vaccines least slightly less effective. 

You certain be. Change yourself. Thank Germany Merkel US, China India trying waive vaccine patents WTO level since April, Germany opposes it.    airport dude state denial. least y’all football game last night guess.  You’re comparing medieval times 2021?  group subreddits members could efficiently manage pandemic better government has. would nice taken seriously would listen ideas often. think individualism stretch you’re taking people who’ve succumbed propaganda. Honest question (that eventually morphed several): governments around world seem reluctant announce Covid become endemic never wiped out?

When government announce Covid becoming endemic people get boosters every year, possibly wear masks needed go lives? don’t recall government official acknowledging this. know lot stupid people anyone even ounce common sense knowledge human viral behavior surely knows this. Quarantines useful virus hasn’t yet metastasized throughout population Covid mutates way quickly restrictions work anymore. matter precise efficacy protection, common sense tells us better. 

I've covid I'm triple vaxxed. Even chances reinfection low even without vaccine, still can't think single good reason get vaccinated.   live life, vaccinated not.
They make excuses, cite BS social media posts, continue selfish, ignorant assholes. Holy shit. going able get back US? South Africa it’s hesitancy, supply issue low vaccination rate. plenty vaccines takers. countries enough vaccines point. Vaccine availability issue. Reading feels like January 2020 again. potlucks. necessarily bad thing. 2 countries roughly equal covid case loads, flying irrelevant. da f need new kinda vaccine? Pfizer Moderna Sputnik commenting new vaccine point. beginning real pandemic.  media bored Delta. people getting sick often vaccinated asymptomatic, necessarily mean big deal weaken immunity staying home less exposed. infectious that's bad need avoid it. people think they're sick expose vulnerable people. earliest detection found place highest number cases though (South Africa) 

Couldn't reason detected aside travel contact-with-travelers outside SA simply SA first country part global travel network Omicron appeared?  Oh thinking day. drugs like heroine taken veins forearm vaccine stabbed arm random spot. True - I'm assuming I'm 3/4's way typical life span, guarantees get more. saying thing morning, it’s already US. SA Airlines flying JFK, IAD to, like, yesterday. Undoubtedly infected person disembarked one flights. probably originate SA. might permanently wear masks grocery stores doctor's offices, tbh. They're essential services everyone, including immunocompromised, need. think worth protecting them. name like cartoon villain's super-weapon?

Mwahahahaaaa, unleash OMICRON!!!!!!!!   true. whole year. need full PCR EU AFAIK, something recently changed? summer antigen test enough. expecting forever? China strategy best one. whole world applied it, pandemic would already close be. Omicron changes nothing regard strategy. Yes will. called martial law. Lmao skipped letter Xi I’m sorry, hospitalized 80% unvaccinated. I’m Colorado last looked third infections. Reaching capacity week so. detect it, tell anybody think society resilient 1400s today? Why? source: trust bro. saying Chise literally scientist knows way you, wrong? I’m glad finally started caring viruses they’ve centuries. single case confirmed likely means many cases exist. Well talking mandating work, will? saw case medical personal giving vaccines instead misinformed treatement (can't find source), going work larger scale real solution misinformation. shellfish. shellfish vaccine people making vaccine could consumed shellfish cross contaminated, creating shellfishness process. real reason people get vaccinated shellfishness. chose path, despite everyone begging pleading get vaccinated. 

Nothing hilarious it. mean uncertain terms: fuck ‘em deserve get. think there's anything nefarious going on, bad inadequate testing. tried cognitive therapy? get massive amount tourists snowbirds surprise. Even already 2022. 80% unvaccinated hospital? state? kids got second doses pfizer vaccine morning. tons kids waiting Walgreens us. seven year old panic attack right sat chair vaccine pressed got done. sweet woman cheered left vaccination area helped us feel bit better. I’m proud kids parents today getting second dose. We're masking Netherlands again, since weeks.  Hey man, got COVID last Christmas symptoms you’ve described more. past months I’ve really started turn corner I’m mostly dealing shortness breath deconditioning. long haulers attest, gets better takes time. graceful know it’s forever. found meditation, light exercise cutting inflammatory foods aided recovery. course, importantly, sleep. Best luck.  regular flights London (and much EU) LA SFO. fact dinner last week someone got plane Paris. Guess go get tested. Knee-jerk appropriate reaction point. guess SA would rather world give two weeks export every corner planet confirming actually big deal shutting travel then. 

You react situations like know it’s big deal think might be. ends overblown, it. people always complain proactive action completely averts crisis, saying something like, “You made big deal ended complete *nOtHiNgBuRgEr*!!!” Yeah, point proactive prevent crisis, make marginally less horrible. bit knee-jerk beginning this, maybe wouldn’t situation now. share airplane, airport, ticket clerk, baggage handler, fast food worker, taxi driver, front desk clerk, maid, hallway right? right?? Source? Omega jab collector. 10-15% 600 passenger flight infected variant SA Netherlands. yeah, it’s breeding weeks. Inescapable point. would asking news broken dangerous variant SA?

We don’t answers yet. Americans live.in Rural areas....people New York, LA like get it.

Any Europeans ever see Black Friday Walmart...even dipshits Americans get Oh, thought said unrelated existing variants? could see skeptical mRNA tech first, new different, enough data continued skepticism impractical. point consider defense South Africa. advanced medical system able identify virus. doesn’t mean virus started there. Delta Dawn flower……. harm 8 weeks online learning kids? 

Did send mine chimney? ain't gettin Decepticon virus Prove Wheel weaves Wheel wills. Yep, hilarious people croak! Love attitude. know seemed reading severe people thought covid (Wow, insane considering DM sent you.) know much wealth transfer? I've seen insane increases among billionaires, example, understand how. vaccines it, *do* get travel again? US citizens, yes He's politician ffs he's basically SAs Fauci equivalent  Ha!

\- non-expert Who’s “they?” Cause I’m (New England), majority people problem this. slave capitalism can't imagine otherwise. sucks. Tomato, tomato. Rationalize argument however want buying significantly product need fear panic buying reasonable definition. Although got booster, definitely don’t feel safe anything Omicron here. Gonna lock another booster available fight it. Already considering getting fourth dose soon. doubtful. 

The colds colds. rest viruses didn’t go away. think projecting ... think anybody, Reddit outside, love lockdowns. Everybody would rather COVID disappears.

Now, see high transmission rates COVID area, lockdowns appropriate? Maybe. Everybody would rather see high transmission rates ... nobody \*wants\* lockdown, many people see less worse alternative dead people piled streets ... False. Yes know point little panic buying, everybody bought little extra stores ran Australia fairly similar US (from could tell visited 2019). People genetic sequencing already think Botswana. Thanks asking!    South Africa punished becoming first country identified new variant covid, actually begin somewhere else base almost certainly smaller people literally spend careers shit. didn't, though. :( read article said hallway camera footage reviewed never interacted. I'll see find - give few. data tell

See. That's new information. article speak it? No.

/s Germany stone ages comes digitization. What? Stay away! advocating national guard lock US 8 weeks. That's basicly asking civil war, would utterly destroy US economy, working poor would forced work anyway since essential jobs.

Let's forget continued damage kids 8 weeks online learning. kids get 2nd dose tomorrow. Many us know damage online learning kids, again, especially vacinated  Please don’t live fear virus. respected take appropriate measures. Sometime feel living dystopian movie too. hard hope bad news fear around don’t let period rob hopes dreams, pray. _Aye, put finger sky want n-
Aye, put two fingers sky want it_ almost certainly around months know think been. Nobody knows Science isnt partisan.....science experiementisan? Won’t happen. Dispersion is, would hard believe someone saying already. agree you. That’s I’m worried What's definition mild? Tim Ferris recently breakthrough case story far mild.

He spoke breakthrough case   UK government already has, much better europe partially due reason. political raise valid points.

Theres definitely element people stepping reality, maybe sunk cost fallacy. Third time? Damn okay? We’re vaxxed Take get PCR test piece mind. reasonable point - interest downplaying variant, since country that's blockaded. imply bias, certainly we'd call ""conflict interest"". 10% thousands cases well required sample size generalized entire population. Presuming sampling fairly randomly, there's almost chance major omicron surge evaded them. Well talking 'new viruses' difference progressive mutation, recombination, 'jump'-mutation host jumps.

Basically 5 jump mutations discussed (alpha-delta, omicron) hundreds detected progressive mutations dozend recombinations - dark number probably 10x 100x that.

Nontheless jump mutation fueling outbreak noticeworthy, since unlikely big implications alpha-delta variants winter/spring 20/21.

On hand designated VOI less significance VOC cases jump mutations like little significance. I’m triple vaccinated, worried. Could already terrible 'cold' people weeks?
Maybe showing tests? remember years ago, went doctor's feeling sick, handed surgical mask put waiting protocol time someone came flu-like symptoms. really hope extend mask wearing hospitals makes SENSE sick people would wait single room together maskless lol. Obvs possible mutation dominant, highly transmissible also mild, symptom-wise? Meaning, could take version people catching it’s like Covid-Lite since mutation weakened? Remember first travel ban passengers dumped Boston's Logan International crowded together, sharing virus? quarantine, masks, isolation measures, stay crowded terminal hours hours go crowded buses make sure everyone gets lungful. Travel bans lesser countries voters usually travel to.

Didn't USA ban incoming travel EU ? countries banned flights UK ? Netherlands great many flaws opinion, comparing United States like comparing Hendrik Lorentz Louie Gohmert. take precautions listen experts that’s living fear. knew variant back July. 2% way violent, vix 30 4 times year allready, didnt get 30....

This tiny little blip, time buy SPY leaps :)  Airline staff : Fuck don’t want inject vaccine veins. want muscle. Injecting veins cause problems. It’s US. absolutely reason afraid flying days ago. Well, headline indicates SA's health minister says, article also says this: ""While spread new variant still early stages, yet clear severe infection would vaccinated person."" US confirmed. NYC state emergency. Dec worse ever. know there's risk, call dumb. understood antigen test leaving PCR landing.  Perhaps testing difference. Dutch government looking ahead 2-5 days? Totally incompatible ""We'll get get there""-attitude. LOL. Take upvote, genetically enhanced comedian. hoping fly home 11th December. It’s two years since saw family. mum melanoma diagnosis past year. She’s really well living overseas hard. booked fully flexible airfares.

I breakthrough case Delta, it’s sick I’ve ever been. Even months later, horrible fatigue brain fog, get heart palpitations time, resting BPM high, lungs still don’t feel right, still shortness breath coughing problems there. 

But didn’t go hospital, still considered “mild” case. new variant get infectious deadly ? hopefully Pfizzer vaccine works it.. make booster next weeks (done full scheme May) hope need new booster next 6 months again.

If put another room, would decent ventilation HEPA filters. Yes, US states sequencing. far others. Generally high-population states like California, Texas, Florida, New York more. Others like Oklahoma less.

Some US territories don’t much sequencing, least one territory (American Samoa remember correctly) that’s they’ve gotten first COVID case fairly recently.

Maybe people took Merck pill within 3 days infection would rate similar Pfizer?  confirmed cancelled dinner better covid

Your life mate. draw line? Covid going away anytime soon know. It'll remain endemic always crop up. going continue cancelling stuff every time news new variants pops up? I'm common sense, precaution following science strikes overreacting media hype. enjoy can, going take spread NY/NYC  assuming they're American.

Maybe 40s 70s, mass campaign lead public health professionals government would done. Nowadays rely private sector handle everything. would take complete reversal political culture government take approach, there's nobody it. know standard NHS lateral flow tests work well detect Omicron? assume PCR I'd they're finding sequencing they're saying many variations strains. Stay Oregon. us don’t mind. state emergency allow access resources may needed. Y’all believe anything anyone tells you, huh 100 different cancers plenty different ‘heart diseases’. That’s what’s happening COVID.

You’re right think heart health, you’re bringing minimize dangers COVID, you’re uninformed best. Yup. one mfer actually wear mask. got impression speaking room put exiting plane wait testing . could benign countries cautious know more

i'm US (insert normal comments knowing world politics) i'm familiar structure countries involved, know countries travel bans states/counties/municipalities attempting defy national leadership like desantis/abbott wanted last year US? 2 channels light up? explain means? know PCR RT-qPCR. assumed performed RT-qPCR test, that’s increase fluorescent signal. really need better way describing “mild” disease. right now, “mild” could mean anything slight head cold worst flu you’ve ever + long term lingering brain, heart, lung issues. long didn’t go hospital, it’s considered mild. 

The “mild” spectrum far large. Yeah, competition England, Delta. SA ""easy"" dominant. love guys try hang WSB cool, comes desperate obvious zero real money market. think worst case scenario could lockdowns. Omicron deadly MERS kills 30 percent people catch evades vaccines... Maybe. course that's extremely unlikely, fact 1 3 chance death elicits maybe says lot. Lucky, guess might well go future since past useful fun Lockdown vaccinated? think so. start holding morons refuse get vaccinated responsible actions.  wonder—even fully vaccinated booster, thinking AIRPORT place stay maskless? 2.5 hours early airport, couldn’t find single spot maskless person wasn’t eyesight. People maskless HOURS. HOURS!!

I appreciated notice could see it, see people various ages, races, genders maskless…I think really commit getting booster get time Got it! another irish citizen yes that's overboard even know Ireland currently! 

But terribly general follow public health advice things feel unsafe! Wear mask avoid large crowds new normal unfortunately. UK travel ban?

Haha kid. Travel bans lesser countries voters usually travel to. think almost tests essentially self tests least U.S. live - I’ve never seen one don’t hand swab swab yourself. go large county testing sites walk drive up, hand swab tube, swab break tube, drop large bin.  

These accepted many purposes (return school/work, play sports, etc) though sure special ones travel since haven’t done any. days, weeks here. feel like derelict boomer trapped Orwellian perma-lockdown :(. still explain 10% random group suddenly positive. lockdowns!! add humor -

As soon saw named ""Omicron"", immediately thought ""Omicron Persei 8"" mean countries banned entering US (like UK, entirety europe, china, brazil, etc) unbanned Dutch person, I'd say right, also missing point focussing intellect infrastructure. Empathy genuine long term thinking receiving attention country well capable giving them.

I'd less interested comparing country countries cheer ""we're better"" (in ways), I'd interested identifying shortcomings Netherlands.

In opinion, arrogance exceptionalism ('we good', 'these rules me') prevalent cultural problems amongst many Dutch big mistake. read comment. think would correct lot modest. agree. version mild sniffles, head cold, etc. problem initially reported China 85% cases mild 5% ""severe."" We, healthcare community though 5% bad, admitted hospital overall group. 5% turned needing ICU near death. 85% ""mild"" includes people sick home unable move 4-6 weeks. He’s basing exactly?  people planning live decades life assumed international travel would matter day’s effort, Typhoid Mary journey plague boat.  It’s gone undetected aren’t sequencing viruses systematically far I'm aware, airline actually operates 800+ seats, that's theoretical maximum all-economy configuration. oh yeah forgot already near december fault, left house 2 years without hazmat suit. There's tremendous incentive geopolitical perspective downplay severity current variant. due respect don’t want big companies making people think vaccinations effective towards strains without support claims. It’s pretty much way make people panic vaccinate like boosters.

I’m anti vaccine I’ve got booster I’m sure companies research.  small town Northern Ireland id say 90% people wear masks shopping great CDC richest powerful nation earth known rather guessing. Currently, transfer happening direction. Take vaccine, wear mask, social distance good about. step outside house neighborhood, town, etc see thousands people moved on. Current best evidence right holiday shopping. Masks 50/50 probably good estimate vaccinated. Booster wise, maybe much believe boosters everywhere green lit. 

The days staying worrying seem most. time go adjusted new normal simple vaccine optional mask. one required, it’s always on, isn’t, definitely see people rip right off. guess it’s game maintaining vaccine usage kind like flu decades. think talks double shot something Covid flu vaccine I’ll definitely first take kill two birds one stone mask cherry top.

I swear soon got second dose May so, worrying soon vanished. huge crowd others line front behind definitely reassured maybe week ago probably would stressed out. Everyone mask on, gladly took shots, went day. feel whenever start worrying again, picture line people simply going place provides future vaccines/boosters, getting shot, going day. Essentially silent majority could say. taken granted flu slowly starting Covid. cheeseburger vaccine free. It’s called “not buying cheeseburger” it’s available century. 

**Daily boosters required**.  Yeah shocking, lived w/ Covid positive people, symptoms didn’t get + 14 days. Started w/ fatigue sore throat, flipped congestion got positive body cleared quickly.  Denmark, positive cases sequenced. There's lag, course, great gets done. along COVID asymptomatic mild even unvaccinated people. insidious. made everyone sick never would become pandemic. england one restrictions. northern ireland, scotland wales restrictions.   Kapt. Obvious. Delta dominant SA, too. 90% continuously since late July. buy shit ton (shares contracts) UVXY watch shit shoot 200. least option contracts couple weeks insurance. Oh, spooky! (Also obviously don’t know Greek). would miracle!  thinking far ahead? We’ve entire sections country terrible crises lock anywhere. think so. black death killed society collapse. Exactly. becoming horse race betting. two added things consider:

1. 61 people ones wanted travel managed end negative rapid test results prior so; know many people planned make trip actually popped negative results end plane.

2. 61 taken two flights, one -- one came Johannesburg, Cape Town. far see, clarity yet 61 cases distributed them. I'd interested finding out, though probably matter much. Horse left barn, cancel travel bans. It’s certain somewhat effective, important questions effective long  course every major city going prepare.

What's also clear highly vaccinated countries still seeing hospitalization rates unvaccinated fight covid.  


Vaccines work, probably still working variant, mainstream media needs wants attention. nice balance socialism capitalism created vaccines made available. Lots grants/government funding, cheaper government rates purchase vaccines companies ($15-18 per shot), giving vaccine people free— using logistics, distribution, production/manufacturing, etc capitalist companies actually make get vaccine. 

It combined overall effort socialism capitalism (where everyone wins long people take vaccine). personally really liked see it.  Simpsons joke Dude hope recovers well. mother got back January (it killed grandmother time, still refuses vaccination, grr), still can't smell taste anything. Variant detection retrospective always takes time discovery public awareness. theory many people ill enough land hospital, went largely undetected. know look for, we're learning there's growing number cases across Europe. I'm guessing we'll see cases US well, possibly dating back several weeks. 

Has anyone known case died yet? read far cases mild. That's reassuring me. might wishful thinking part, think fits sky-is-falling-scenario yet. Thank well wishes 😊 I'm going downvote. get it. think dumb play lottery, doesnt mean think people shouldn't. dumb drink beer, last night.

Things dumb, make decisions. I'm expert heard people say possibility. seriously don’t understand people latch onto non stop fear porn stream sub. Old enough 10% group random passengers infected, new enough develop major symptoms yet? Possible, sounds like small window. exciting! Bring COVID-19! course not, human. Trust me, mental exhaustion worrying lot many things happening once. see lot guilt post, think aim feel OK everyone else around may follow. post really resonated I've exact thing (death parent much earlier affect time many things mention ring bell). took 4 years finish masters feeling large void inability focus. spend around 3 years literally looking videos youtube. really, really struggled procrastinating finishing. Also, applied many jobs one wanted hire experience. became really awkward lack contact creeped everyone. 

The way change look work countries 29. long started feel things moving, situation got gradually better. took time ''remember'' interact properly people, still awkward. way improve. Try keep things worry simple (just keep one thing getting job now, really help everything else) try worry everyone else. least now. wonder feel way overload head (which ofc comes good place).

All difficulties experiencing strength, figure way overcome (or live them) able help people life too. people would entering US east coast.

Over/under omicron severely neutralize effectiveness current rotation vaccines Biden administration impose national lockdown US? matter? Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, Czech Republic, UK want count them. surprised since opened thread. Yeah, people stopped traveling entire pandemic. know someone currently traveling unvaccinated child South Africa US Thanksgiving break 🤦‍♀️ Believe closer 25%.  Hi friend, I've never Africa all, grew impoverished countries.

Sadly certificate faking totally thing, esp. poorer countries. Everybody already either ""knows guy"", acquaintance help find said guy.

My point is: already place established mature infrastructure (however informal) forgery. One must assume covid certificates impervious this.  examples: 2nd wave, lots developing world travel agencies handing fake negative tests bought travel package. stil happening. Bribes: ie: really high % vaccinated people many bribed nurses fill form without getting shots. measures late mostly PR move watch news grunt approvingly government. 8% positivity rate bad. Actually, I’ve wondering happened time frame. Using rapid test doesn’t match makes ton sense. Bunch assholes read somewhere (looking references now) way Spanish flu ended. Mutations became progressively contagious less deadly. could actually positive step right direction. No. I’m expressing hope national standards living independent culture heritage. That’s foundational past 75 years Western philosophy 2 cases population 50 million breaking news now.

I've never convinced never ends. still live general location cared much? Lock shift burden wealthy work home poor working poor not. Also point school closures done serous damage kids really last resort Virgin coronavirus vs ChAd vaccine think really informed people like target article.

I stay COVID news anymore. got vax booster go life mask hand washing. hear travel restrictions new variant state emergency NY want look quick summary what's going on.

This gives quick rundown one spot. Unless whole planet gets vaccinated stops giving virus hosts mutate in, keep going going going. us decades. significant minority planet never vaccinated. Source? I'm curios antivaxxer lunatics say would able tell people SA hospitals pretty quickly. already report released people hospitals unvaxxed cases right now

 Huh? person replying make _any_ claims- asked question. answer yes, possible mutate transmissable less symptoms, course guaranteed, could also become deadly. Thank much-needed childish giggle lol. Snot. Yeah pro diseasers convinced logic. Guys make difference took 4 months, two doses? surmised patient infected Covid unnaturally long period time assumed HIV patient, since immunocompromised + Botswana = HIV 

I don’t know exactly Covid would best mutate patient article didn’t elaborate point, though I’m guessing see soon.

Sorry, wish could helpful can't know sure yet. soon hospitals collapse, room patients, problem too! kids got seconds today, also! steady stream kids coming vaccinations. county 30% first vax 5-11! got booster couple days broke. It’s good protection covid general high could be. Downside substantially vaccine resistant booster release fast (doubtful knows), probably wait bit get it. Good thing claimed evades immunity vaccines etc prior us even completing study. 

Fear mongering helps nobody now. Yes, hospitalisation stats take longer start going up. There's inconsistencies dail reporting recently. tried, dude. agree you. taking sh-t another thread earlier suggesting thing (that is, horse already barn found bunch countries). Good. I’m mulling mind spreads mutate quickly. May good may worse later? Isn’t goes? Totally agree, first time pandemic I’ve felt suspicious lot experts rolling panicky threads. seem algorithm chasing. Well, restrictions work either. matter government does, always wrong according some... really hope  impossible contain virus. impossible start impossible variants.

It way transmissible insufficiently lethal contain.

Nothing fundamentally changes, get vaccinated. Delta established everyone catching virus there's ""herd immunity"" it'll kill around 2% people get vaccinated. Nothing likely change much, small tweaks one way another percentage value.

And new variants every 6-12 months next 50 years. decide they're worth headlines more? also provided zero data. unvaccinated going die much, though recoveries COVID count vaccinations anyways. wonder first dose really relevant. already way lower protection knew vaccine waning. wouldn’t surprising numbers almost insignificant.

The real hope 90% recently fully vaccinated boosted, CDC fucked booster rollout tremendously. flu entirely different virus different characteristics allows easily recombine strains. also lots previous immunity flu population still inhibits it’s severity spread. Next up: Rumplestiltskin Variant they? Why? SA couple days already, we'll know 2 weeks believe. unlikely border shutdowns really much think.

Especially considering literally hundreds thousands people illegally come across southern border... 2 Million people *apprehended* so, presumably smaller (but quite large absolute sense) number people made through. yeah. understood.  mean low testing plane... .I meant general SA public.. 10% prevalence (or anywhere close that) infected people boarded plane. relief man President. like Ike White House again. tested positive. 28 wedding last weekend. vaccine (but booster). Felt scratchy throat Wednesday got rapid PCR test day make sure COVID saw family. Rapid came back negative, sore throat minor figured weather changing. told everyone seeing information had, sentiment me, ""sure cold, vaccinated, hugging it'll fine.""


Each day I've felt worse worse since then, took 72 hours get PCR results back. I've exposed entire family feel awful it. called everyone told go get tested. Praying cause super spreader event. 


If testing better rapid accurate PCR came back sooner, could exposed many people.  make reasonable response point? Coming someone despise masks. honestly think one key problems messaging regarding masks people positions power laying clear metrics go away good. I'm anti-mask person, fully vaccinated etc. clarification would nice even uncertainty around Covid. Even something like, ""when hit x number deaths per day stay two weeks masks come off"" or, ""x percent vaccinated"" like. kind immutable metric signifies level Covid live with. regions this, many (I'm USA response largely devolved regionally and/or onto states). incredibly frustrating, see, least people keep edge time threat always bringing back various restrictions/inconveniences, think valid perspective often dismissed. short answer no, hybrid viruses like describing actual concern outside thought experiments, specific scientific experiments. HIV COVID completely different viruses, even use different ways replicating genomes. like tiger lion mating get hybrid liger (which happen), like trying get squid-eagle hybrid. 

Having said that, u/doedalus u/jdorje pointed out, recombination happen commonly virus types, causes problems us past. Influenza good example well closely related viruses reshuffle genomes gain ability infect different species (birds, humans, pigs). Africa (to lower degree) South America south Asia lot mammal species similar humans disease jumps (zoonosis). zoonosis likely create deadly disease within-human evolution. chance. odd seems lot misinformation media saying vaccine evading baseless anti vax. media basically anti vax right  ridiculous. Either lockdown don't. Finally. Let’s get shit done already. unfortunately happen quick enough avoid hospitals getting overwhelmed.

This ghoulish language absolutely ashamed yourself. South African doctors told causes mold symptoms, fatigue, rare cough. contigous, less serious.  Lag longer, 2 4 weeks...  Right, know data doesn’t exist it’s impossible exist data take weeks collect. So, question believe source? claim he’s somehow time traveler? 

I don’t understand. That’s interesting, worked? Banning alcohol sales would also kill dependent it’d numbers game here, unless ban sales bars restaurants sales home use? 

I live city drunks built service industry there’s win anyone (or business) model, unfortunately, would limit spread sure. curfews limit hours alcohol sold places illegal lock-ins Words. I’m typing words. got booster week. debating day Thanksgiving, working, vaccinations always make feel like shit. anyway slogged through. comes I'm glad went ahead took opportunity. Alot news stories saying variant evades immunity 500 times transmissible. based anything concrete EU health official parroted it. Well me, nothing. 

I'm fully vaxxed. Everyone family fully vaxxed. I'm streets protesting lockdowns. letting become enraged antivaxxers. 

I'm good. keep fighting. wait explain bit ? HIV Heard rumor. people flight show proof negative test within 24 hours. either faked tests, tests false negatives and/or poorly administered, spread quickly plane (apparently one masked flight according NYT reporter it), don’t think low testing cause particular incident. Yeah! That's excellent analogy! Ah shit, go again. Sorry :-/  Get third dose ASAP. jinx us I’d surprised it’s every state already… we’re least 20/30 days behind virus minimum.

There's reason governments bail restaurants similar businesses tune billions billions dollars. neither business structure employees sustain restricted services. 

And dismissive attitude businesses workers helpful, either  sequence fully spot one anymore... least labs indicated one widely used PCR test, one three target genes detected (called gene dropout gene target failure) test therefore used marker variant, pending sequencing confirmation,"" statement explained. thing probably dangerous live-virus vaccine worth risk. Chinese inactivated vaccines seem fine; takes longer build immunity IIRC. Maybe comes ass Why? Antibiotics 

Antibiotics cure bacteria. Switzerland global headquarters many huge pharma companies weren’t interested making vaccines (when covid first hit) bc traditionally aren’t profitable.

again. 37 billion profit. COVID VACCINE MARKET LANDSCAPE COMPLETELY CHANGED since everyone needs one governments financing it. 

Again 80% financing came private investors.
Pharma companies tech, research people. invested decades. 


Funny? Oh I'll say : capitalism socialism indeed sort arch-enemies.
Socialism nothing.

You still explain socialism anything this. again. roll every months. toilet paper research. actually want variant extremely transmissible much less lethal. can't try tailor one know nobody would want responsible deaths cause. want 'common flu' variant. defer video Mr. Pentinnen missed wanting told good things part childhood thought.  Glad you’re vaccinated though. Los Angeles, New York, etc...places many direct International flights. daughter college student, I’m hoping come home 3 weeks. She’s 3x vaxxed 😭 doubting, link source? Gonna go limb say people gotten yet, going change anything. mandate it, apparently constitutional. Unfortunately US also lax afraid hurting feelings 25% hates told people trying scam them.

I dont think would go forever, least like this. Eventually it'll like dealing measles: still problem, people realize many unvaccinated people one place time. incubation time covid several days several hours. would infected way flight.  probably dumb question, supposed prove negative LFT? entering test result app that's totally reliant people's honesty? No.

Those people tested positive COVID19. sequencing takes know strain.

The media however deliberately making sound like omicron though. fever climate change. Covid headache. want see old parents die? everyone lives country grew in. True, must get point read articles fear new info. I'm talking article specifically, general thought.  know sure yet. COVID low levels SA new variant appeared. One two super spreader events could caused spike cases Omnicron seen there. wait see happens identified community high levels circulating Delta _and_ high levels vaccination. I’m triple vaccinated. I’m also geneticist, obviously I’m worried. matter many boosters get vaccine isn’t going protect can’t see virus. 

I don’t know omicron big one. don’t info yet. know it’s going stop mutating one, maybe next next that. 

The vaccines first miracle. pace research second - learning much fast. becoming much better keeping thing killing us. Hopefully also learn avert disability. aren’t done yet stay front thing. NY 68%. states downwards 45%.  NY one small piece puzzle. 700 000+ deaths won't, new threat will. 


Sure will. It’s much climate, climate causes people behave. Cold weather = closer together time spent inside  Work: Makes come back office anyway Knowing know India, Africans going lynched. us conditions make protections even guarantee. I’m still awaiting updates antibody t-cell studies I’m in. I’m hardly alone groups. I'm hoping kind research convinces FDA/CDC endorse boosters every six months. Let's it. could probably use $10k get fresh start leaving ass. Wait, really? I'm murican, sound like murican's ""we"" long time. would spur anti vaxxers? exactly expecting. ""Watch us get shot new variant comes need shots"". saying right. Can't enable behavior. keep treating people like children, continue expecting everything served silver platter. If/when encounter another pandemic- would even disastrous. 1 3 CFR variant? idea idea even comes from. I’m aware *any* evidence whatsoever time even comes close suggesting morality rate like that. needs evidence substantiation, let’s keep dreaming worst case scenario fantasies reason promulgate fear. 

I’m convinced many, many people social media like engage borderline masturbatory fear fantasies; sitting around dreaming catastrophic scenarios head. Isolating right fine, I'm it. I'm asking longer-term approach, say Winter 2026 vaccines continue widely available effective ~100% population immunity either vaccination exposure. (or least, historically) go 10-day isolations influenza common disease, COVID likely become. 10, 20, even 30 days sudden isolations year seems like giant burden impose everyone without thinking carefully, especially considering many people obligations (family members, work, etc) make sudden 10-day isolations impractical people may even symptomatic. already spent good portion 20s isolated cancer. It’s lot again. secret chemo can’t quit you’re tired. cope (or don’t) keep going keep surviving. find ways keep busy enjoy little moments. I’m beyond prepared devastated much life way. people decide risk fine long kills elderly immunocompromised, begins even dark lockdown people decided it’s okay die fun. really might always part life I’m 30s. want look hospitalizations critical care/ICU combination lethality. Delta lethal/transmissible enough overwhelm hospitals areas means probably concerned it. Still waiting hear back whether Omicron good news bad news regard (it's variant concern due transmissibility gist I've read), would like info anyone knows any. Gosh shitty paper. “Fear real. place fear exist thoughts future. product imagination, causing us fear things present may ever exist. near insanity. misunderstand danger real fear choice.” It’s hard correlate numbers correctly alpha delta variants vaccines significantly better ways knowing treat virus initial onset novel virus. Via casinos?  Thank you! 

I also sure first read that, stand corrected. tell SA department health chairperson early data cases mild. zero evidence worse.  inclined go along govt directive

Dude, would worn masks without govt directives.

In Vietnam, criticised government measures strict enough, full lockdown anything it'd opposite - 'why would get vaccinated variant escapes vaccine?' get doctor friend compared group 73 people weathered bout COVID-19and went get two doses mRNA vaccine, boosted group’s median antibody level 68% leader Alexis Demonbreun, cell biologist Northwestern University’s Feinberg School Medicine, said data demonstrate **no matter well protected vaccinated person may think is, getting booster shot likely increase neutralizing antibodies — it, immunity — considerably.** scientists expect large antibody responses create durable immunity, protection afforded booster last longer initial two-shot regimen did.

Doesn’t get clear-cut that. excuse get three shots, even people covid two shots already. It’s 18 months. patience! Governments always best interest heart. mental health shitter lost job multiple times! together, 15 days slow spread friend :D agree statement factually accurate, probability leans side case. Let’s fuckin hope so. long? 2 years? 4? 10? Management trying bully bluff way thru fall it.

I remember years earlier industry US complaining loudly ""the nurse shortage"" wanted import nurses countries would work less. pretty much ""the trucker shortage"" (and every worker ""shortage"" we're hearing right now) industry wants pay incredibly shit salaries complains there's shortage advantageous citizens take jobs take them. could going fun.

You still go fun. ends accept fact probably going get covid. 22, relatively good health, fine. 

I've worked entire pandemic industry known air quality. smoke. go bars. go friends. spend time family. I'm cognizant / I'm feeling little ""meh"" proactive things like taking supplements, eating right, monitoring symptoms (if any), etc. 

Just live life. young let become major source depression. They're saving final boss. variant spreads super fast mild hell ends pandemic all. celebrating Omicron day cool merch stuff… *should* wont Yup. It’ll nyc isn’t already.  You’re ruining buzzword “mEdiA FeArMoNgErInG” narrative facts. Stop it. long? decade? COVID probably never going way agencies need least 1 week 2 get accurate results variant, mean time see infections skyrocket. So, worst case, getting vaccinated protect existing variants omicron. Exactly said above. I'm sure be. 24 hour fear news cycle really capitalizing variants messaging comes bans, straight locked us rest world AGAIN, happened anyone else including China thing originated never seen accurate numbers of.

In SA numbers low months extremely limited travel due last variant deteted, even fully vaccinated people, notice shut again.

Also numbers go lockdowns extreme I'm aware countries go far banning alcohol sales ensure people drinking socializing spreading virus. Futurama fan. 0 microns? mask stop it. may point businesses fine - feel Delta Airlines false equivalency worldwide established brand decades. also don’t level competition relatively small number airlines compared industries.

My curiosity mostly might impact smaller businesses lesser known brands names became associated death machine. That's actually point. People hoping behave like Spanish flu. I'm saying let's hope. Let's take precautions watch carefully. well established Florida's numbers work fiction stop counting? There’s Christmas News Years… US government man's fuck requires everyone vaccinated, go forever media fails again. Politicians well. described article ""lockdowns"" lockdowns. Finger wagging best. What’s suspicious data available still aren’t vaccinated I'm vaccinated currently vaccine clinic kids keep assuming things. thousands variants. Kakashi cosplay everyday That’s testing works. think saw interview preliminary results showed mutated virus possibly evade vaccines. said would 2-3 weeks scientific data. mention sure idea variant less deadly infected. It’s still “new”. course, mild case strep throat (to use example), unreasonable wear mask get groceries, pick lunch drive-thru, walk park, etc. likely continue quarantine longer symptomatic either. No, leaders talk higher. Let's panic. Given use present-tense, I'm guessing current booster dose. Speculation, much known yet.  concerned 4th. one inevitably needed variant. Guess always concerned. Nope. never considered it, either.

I assumed hoping keep dying. ""The patient Campania positive Covid 19 sequence attributable Omicron variant identified, returned Italy days ago Mozambique plane landed Milan.

On landing, man subjected swab later positive. The alarm recent days travelers returning southern Africa turned spotlight case, starting in-depth feedback family members, residing Campania."" You’re fucking insane pal. 90% adults New York received least one dose. impossible accomplishment. It’s combination mutations past variants shown reduced immunity effectiveness also made virus contagious. variant since Delta concerning one. Whether actually worse Delta, won’t know while. objectively something scientists concerned monitoring. 

It would taken 5 seconds googling know this, wouldn’t fit narrative, would it? could wear N95. Like always rarely leave home. Make home cozy stay home much possible. worth going unless necessary. measure R_t R_0, though, comparing apples oranges? Like, think many places Delta R_t 2 recent months... fear mongering headlines hitting pushing everyone get vaccines. Nothing suspicious think time see new wave hitting Europe mostly new variant. Look numbers exploded past month. Insert braceyourself.jpg meme here. 
 
I would extremely surprised gotten toehold everywhere - reason know we're testing specifically it, incubation period.  
 
[Britain, Germany Italy report first 
 
I believe first case South Africa discovered two weeks ago Nov. 11th. long spreading around locally first detection? many people passed along 11th today? 
 
We *slow* spread point proper mitigation efforts. think would fooling think going place end year, dominant strain outright matter weeks. Per capita, DeSantis killed 20,000 Americans Maryland. thought name Brandon? shit, plus risk death vent permanent disability  things larger repercussions Vaccine mandates flights mandatory testing would great idea now. Especially Holiday travel looming. Hey y’all. trying figure lethality rates delta versus original strain, got argument assumption less lethal transmissible. 

So googled it, articles popped quite strange. little analysis, lots inconclusive studies bereft much data, yet stories seems desperate imply delta lethal. 

How widely available information? entire world working problem can’t get simple graphic comparing lethalities two strains, tens millions data points (and probably way more). 

My spider sense says information strategically suppressed. all, delta lethal, every news org would shouting rooftops. Thank god someone said—news media outlets everyone salivating chance post sensationalized headlines riling masses chance they'd test positive infected flight. somehow case, variant replicates detected lot faster anything we've seen yet.  feel bad mourn tastebuds, remembered canned pears taste like. talked important protect vaccinate immunocompromised think mutation aspect got talked enough  didn’t bother translating. say person first got infected test went sequenced? zero evidence milder past variants point. Stop spreading misinformation.  exactly method used develop vaccines back would use live vaccines. That's development vaccines took decades, needed replicate test virus millions times. 

Modern vaccines course longer live live vaccines pose significant risk individuals unable fight even reduced variant.

Non-live vaccines much safer course getting sick virus rather exposed protein virus (like spike protein covid). But, even proteins intensely complex folds work produce vaccines take lot time.

That's RNA based vaccines particularly wonderful simply sequence RNA virus, attach nice fat lipid enter cell deliver RNA ribosomes hard work synthesizing protein us. really neat :) 

As purposely making less transmissible variant, would take far time develop since would first method mentioned above\^. efforts much better focused immediate aftermath pandemic developing vaccine using fastest safest methods. don’t doubt it, though travel bands country surge shouldn’t considered treated like pariahs, least shouldn’t surprised. It’s tribalistic business usual countries.

I greatly appreciate SA us communicating Beta well Omicron. Science moving quickly. great news, new variant mild even strong spread, mass majority actually even feel sick bothered wear masks. South Africans even vaccinated. Health experts better start saying ""antibodies/efficacy anything besides hospitalization death matter"" said matter that's everyone get boosters. Since amino acids coded 3 nucleotides, every amino acid unique nucleotide code, also possible mutations actual impact amino acid created -- allows estimate baseline mutation rate virus. global scale, used estimate often non-impactful amino acid mutations show up. Ones show often unrelated chains infection likely areas virus optimized environment. Mutations show less often areas likely can't mutated without deleterious effect virus. 

What's interesting Omicron though high number amino acid mutations spike protein, completely disproportionate number mutations proteins. suggests genome faced selective pressures, rather unknown heavily mutative process. old you, mate? I’m speaking selfish asshole doesn’t care inconvenience testing children. 
But, okay, whatever helps sleep night. Believe not, growing children reason travel, even then, still risk minimized much possible. 

Parents, spouses, businesses dealt via calls such. everyone wants, reduce risks traveling. international travel involve 2 week quarantine honest, would cut tavern fun allow peeps feel need visit family get option. issue one like variants. lot studies mutations know individually make virus little fitter combination new ones know anything about. Doomsday assured anything sort, dismiss simply variants turned duds (relative Delta, especially). honest. eat horse paste cure COVID? least two infection Hong Kong vaccinated.

Like literally every single variant has. Luckily still people around like needleasly help incite panic anyway. problem defining essential travel. going holiday essential (no)? visiting family 2 years (maybe no)? visiting sick parent (probably yes)? prove things realistically way insanely bureaucratic?

And (or why) enforce quarantine EU. open borders countries even one country enforces costly hotel quarantines, enter via backdoor.

The current approach (test pre flight after) working well far know mutation actually dangerous yet. quickly implemented quarantine ban system know info variant effects, locking everything hope magically goes away feasible government (unless already independent geographically isolated like NZ, even bow reality living virus now) Ah yeah. see, need give airlines time honor tickets next days cut flights immediately. might \*inconvenience\* people. issue refunds - t's like, whole thing. can't mess business. Let whole country take ass, shareholder value shall infringed. Yeah, viruses mutate thousands times week, mutations shit reproduction spreadability die quick. mutations stick around ones show improvements survivability always bad news us. mutations harmless doesn’t mean one mutation worried nothing scoff at. person trying distract us either stooge agenda. UK best genomic sequencing, least get concrete data don’t agree “total breakthrough” “10% morbidity” parts, pretty much spot on. point vaccines bring severity line flu, vaccine availability pretty damn good. new normal. It’s endemic now, live it.

If vaccines don’t hold well new strain, new strain brings elevated risk severe COVID (not necessarily 10%), we’re back reformulating vaccines waiting. won’t lockdowns US, obviously. We’re less year mid-terms can’t imagine much anything done could used political ads like. Shh.. anger reptile overlords claiming aliens. Even tests false negatives flight, 10% infected time unexpected. Agreed. mean, could deadly, could also *less* deadly. Mutations statistically bound happen, probably several times more. magic sense virus change character completely, genetic limitations. You’re speaking someone lot nasal swabs done name scientific testing. *They pretty fucking brutal done correctly often*.

Your welcome btw. Bye Question: Many countries discovering omicron cases today yesterday, including Belgium, Great Britain, Czech republic others.

Is cases could ""looking variant"", ""looking"", find ""it"" started appear now?

Thanks! honest would surprised turns Omicron actually originated UK South Africa. time tell. Agree feel number never easy find CHOOSING risk lives! literally dumbest argument could possibly put forth. news outlets stop click bait headlines. say don’t know. What’s BS worst variant yet. There’s absolutely data saying worst variant. likely silent generation, actually Eric fiegl ding thinks gonna die. I’m saying Georgia  remember reaction alpha variant?

This true, likely would also need go clinical trials FDA approval.

For think could skip them, note ignoring allergic reactions pretty much side effects vaccine also happen virus. That's coincidence, that's uses virus' spike protein. new protein might new side effects.  study linked surgical masks 11% drop risk, compared 5% drop cloth. 

The study found 5-11% drop risk measured overall seroprevalence population level. that's case, turns masks making material difference all.

Any vaccine drug yielding 5-11% reduction risk would considered effective worthwhile. incorrect?  Thank sweet jebus don’t even speculate: smallpox antivaxers documented thing. smallpox 30% CFR, dangerous children, looks like  urges masturbate mainly matters it’s new?

The downside delaying doses literally fact working one dose entire time delay.

Delaying itself, however, allows immunity stick longer. looking like ideal delay around 6 months. Oh sure. Everyone needs calm though know more.

Evidence suggests major vaccine manufacturers fast-tracking boosters designed Omicron, certainly indicate consensus belief existing vaccines sufficient. I've seen equally compelling analysis mainstream infectious disease experts nature spike protein mutations make variant likely others evade antibodies created existing vaccines. course, may level protection based T-cells immune responses antibodies, there's almost data conclude either direction. 


I would thrilled wrong concerns - like people, I'm end wits pandemic, I'd welcome anything would bring conclusion sooner. However, hoping existing vaccines continue work there's solid evidence support conclusion strategy I'm willing pursue family.  agree 100% thank global corporations like FB that. help propagation disinformation propaganda across platforms correlated similar anti-vax behavior globally. numbers talking would be, example, share people infected variant end mild, moderate, severe disease, hospitalized, intubated, etc. Covid general takes weeks progress infection body-bag (assuming medical care available) and, top that, signs variant’s incubation period longer, we’re still little bit seeing variant folks average. last 12 hours you’ve South African public health folks coming saying see variant causing mostly mild illness (and mean mild unclear; gap medical lay definitions). one good signs seen regrading variant thus far, next weeks see whether indeed case.

It’s obvious. racism isn’t overt - white neighborhoods better served ingrained biases going back decades. downvotes? right place post question?

Some assholes going around downvoting everyone immediately (and regardless content). truly sad lives nothing else pathetic existence attempt gaslight people order feel sense power.

This highly politicized issue people assholes - hey - keep fuck 'em. :) variant far. Antibodies like well fitting suits, weight changes time. B cells like good hoodie, always fit. matter preventing severe cases, spread. another way try force everyone take vaccine Spoiler: ain't going happen. like dozen CONFIRMED countries already. Mother Nature might finally found something biggest parasite (humanity whole, know lot good individuals).  absolutely buried ass. one buying selling.

You listen ""many"". curated group comes across social media timelines occasionally represent field whole. every amateur.

Again, one buying it.   heard term 100 days pfizer yesterday. happened Xi? skipping Greek alphabet now?  “I think UK overreacted,” added. “South Africa’s safe moment.”

Meanwhile 2 flights joburg landed Amsterdam yesterday. 600 people 61 (10%) covid (not yet clear strain).

So good they're informing world, kind figures, actions necessary brave boost now, let sort crafted boosters later feel free get one Directly translated: 600 passengers two KLM flights 🙄🙄 make Pfizer pill free. 90% effectiveness curing deaths. stop beating dead horse. vaccine efficacy vs new variant tested? researchers use animal vitro model ? wait enough vaxxed hospitalizations deaths meaningful statistic? guessing best data, wait it?

Also, new vaccine warranted, easy retool vaccine production? trivial replacing vanilla spike protein mRNA variant's running program? Someone said trials much shorter, happy news. get whenever. lot people time Yeah. really disheartening many people understand, choosing understand, exponential math. Yes. took time last night, announcement made US government check Delta airlines' flight status results, searching flights coming South Africa (Johannesburg) Chicago Atlanta last night. many flights. seeing that, stopped checking cities airlines. Monday, many many flights arrive US without quarantines, passengers carrying virus, spreading it. \* arrivals outside EU Yeah let’s see goes. Gamma bunch mutations, Epsilon concern, Delta managed beat all.

Maybe one Omicron! 😅 Thank GuthrieBot! reason think case. Making claims anything known muddies waters lays groundwork disinformation rationalization lapsed precautions transmission. virus spreads symptoms like rona reason evolve way. Can’t wait fly home tomorrow. Ugh sure. Hell, we'd never wars people complex. Haha This. places shutting borders dumb. it’s going stifle share information nobody wants become isolated. one thing learned - closing borders doesn’t really anything stop spread. Ok source liked removed non reliable seen multiple news outlets reporting detectable PCR tests. You’re preaching choir. I’ve booster I’m trying pursuance siblings get theirs. Imagine COVID related emo songs could had...   'people' South Africa enough doses, problem people want Thank goodness little theory this…I think ppl get super sick vax might silent carriers kept hearing get vaxxed they’re doubling viral load. There’s way know makes sense kinda. thought ppl get sick they’re hospitalized. super sensitive lucky got Jab.  highest cases right total per capira Swiss among freest, prosperous, happiest people earth. often Covid samples tested variants? There’s already epsilon (and several others). next available Greek letter I’m alphabet. Huh. here. supervisor (at medical facility) blared sorts ""I'm getting it, high blood pressure! I'm going fight tooth nail!""

When company told ""no vaxx job"", tried claiming religious exemption. finally became annoying her, went got vaxx. 

Her tale ""being nervous blood pressure shot up,"" ""they told sit while"". stopped hyperventilating decided go ahead. evidently fainted anxiety got it. side effects? No. None. 

The damage anti-vaxx campaigns done job. make normally sane individual hyperventilate faint shows deeply ingrained stuff became her. American, I'm going continue wearing mask public. Exactly. Lockdown worst thing situation, opinion. agree this. wish would it. Would help know odds catching covid stranger outdoors practically zero? Netflix planned whole thing Whatever happens hope go UK trip March 😭 know plenty people gotten breakthrough cases though. sure risk dying, definitely pleasant them. One coworkers fully vaccinated smell taste month. knows damage virus even vaccinated people? Covid-19 got pointers truck stop fellow named ""HIV-1"". This. actually truth R's ""Hurt Durr muh economy"" party line. America's economy house cards built lies incompetence, trying shut even days crumble whole thing. Vaccination rate provence like 7% SA whole 24%. Covid-19 subside?  Sure 😂 Gf able meet pandemic. We've waiting 2 years.

Now country finally green (by EU restrictions) country booked flight day basically.

Coincidentally, first flight lands Netherlands, we're extremely worried right now. knows next chance meet is? vaccinated, see problem it, especially European countries way worse country. Yeah, thought us. Seems like plague stupidity across globe. think extremely understatement - would absolutely insanely high. Everyone would infected within weeks   Let's get stimulus checks  think Reddit world, there’s good amount people love thought lockdown. real world, think would comply. People aren’t willing give social interactions point. I’d admit I’m one them… Christmas markets Europe pretty intense get super crowded. Sequencing positive PCR tests Denmark. find new variant yet recall state ny issuing state emergency variants. Tiger King season 2 now. time. New York Man, people dont understand important part vaccination train immune systems B cells. Yeah like 50 total roughly 30 spike thought? could caught lots, like, 100. people miss flight. Honestly point even think full lockdown doable US even deadly vaccines work. People North America generally seem feel like pandemic doubt lot would follow lockdown rules even best interests. Plus would pokorixkt unpopular even right call Pay wall BS stupid day 2, day 5, day 8 (or whatever) protocol UK. dumb  map updated cases showing Sri Lanka aka India  bit searching find it, get Google-fun phrasing right. bunch results wanted. feel dumb! lot mutations compared variants. could benign countries cautious know Keep reaching 

Ok, this: Trump Biden trash care average citizen. evades natural immunity vaccine immunity maybe much stricter regulations place. think going bad (based early evidence), think return mask mandates lots states. Well going lockdown anyways cancelled dinner better covid  “People done masks since summer time

I’m boosted never stopped wearing mine 

I could see delta UK

While everyone throwing away

Now we’ve got Omicron way…

No Thanks, Thanks

Thank anti vaxxer
Thank anti masker

Now we’ve got Omicron way”

Your comment prompted think Woody Guthrie style song. Worst ever, far… Thought would reply thread clarify things. 

Yes im\_on\_the\_case right, Omicron incredibly transmissible far less lethal would see widespread natural immunity amongst world.

We actually already saw 1890 pandemic despite name Russian flu largely suspected coronavirus known OC43, still spreads day common cold. Now, lot population natural immunity coronavirus. 

If Omicron far less lethal results less severe infection would one best things happen pandemic would spread relatively harmlessly (i.e. result ICU hospitalizations like previous variants) would essentially acquire natural immunity, course supplemented lucky enough vaccinated. 

However, might case reinfection rates believed increased Omicron potential evade immune system. Whether results severe infection, yet know know efficacious vaccine protection it. 

i.e. 

worst case scenario: far transmissible, more/equally deadly, reduced vaccine response.

best case scenario: far transmissible, far less deadly, allows global acquired immunity Thanks Thank you!! I've reading found article explained well one. Yeah agree. Feels like might bias result easier identify PCR test. makes last sentence bother since say means might growth advantage first say Judy easier detect best guess combination extremely low vaccinations since new - impact anything much. main guess still lots restrictions mandates lots places. Mitigation pretty much nil US point. appears due one day like 18k. Seems like data anomaly. recent days elevated huge exponential growth. NYY/Florida/California likely. England one 0 restrictions. parts like Scotland Wales still least mask requirements indoors. two weeks ago three anyway won’t miss time one easily identify selfish and/or ignorant. Interesting there's much difference results restrictive non-restrictive places.

Interesting works right? 😉🥃 It’s almost though permitting travel global pandemic bad idea. hospitalized? I'm assuming not.   Keep mind detected 2 days ago it’s far early enough data make definitive conclusions confidence levels anything.   

When SA/beta first detected massive dread /panic feeling days/weeks worried 75 year old parents getting AZ instead Pfizer (here Canada) AZ didn’t protect well beta. alpha delta city 90% vaccination 12+(5-11 start vaccinated week) gone 7 day average 20 cases per day 40 cases per day 3 months lower vaccinated area shot roof. Kids school make 25% cases.  Went 1.9 test positivity rate 2.9 regions low vaccination went 20% tpr.  

My point being, continue mask along vaccinated restrict unvaccinated form events eating things likely continue were.  Don’t panic ample evidence that’s vaccines aren’t effective blocking infection blocking moderate severe cases deaths.


Hugs Canada ! rest passengers tested negative? might test negative 2-5 days, theyve likely infected plane

Because they’re stupid.  Overreacting. know nothing variant yet regards effectiveness vaccines, hospitalisation serious illness.

If let news like dictate life plans, going life long time. Seems people go walk around outside Amsterdam too. walking streets center also much narrower, really isn’t whole lot room maneuver. wonder variant effect current US housing market? market seem give shit delta - wonder omicron different whelp flew state TGing I'm afraid fly back omicron. realize US yet, probably change Tuesday It’s failed per se, rapid tests accurate enough reliably detect virus asymptomatic people. known drawback rapid test. I’m surprised flight required rapid test within 24 hours PCR test within 72 hours norm around live.

I’m guessing tests received got plane PCR tests (several hours even 24 hours get results). 

There thought aren’t producing enough viral shedding trigger rapid test, may producing enough virus infect around (especially everyone around and/or vaccinated). guideline hard belief though, people’s unique body chemistry may produce less viral load time goes on.  mean gvt absolutely nothing help? PPP specific funds restaurants various levels gvt tremendous amount help – perhaps enough relative crisis, definitely lot historical context, certainly “absolutely nothing.” make point less reasonable without poorly grounded hyperbole. studies infection + vaccine immunity people covid, got vaccinated afterward. 

Do know studies looked reverse order: full vaccination, breakthrough case Delta? It’s weird there’s data immunity many breakthrough cases.  Yea things get bad I'll look cancellation reschedule options, I'm keen it. cancel flight Swiss airways March 2020 took 7 months finally get refund.  Exactly, know everyone pretending like like vaccines provide 100% immunity. live two people fully vaccinated contracted covid. fully vaccinated got it. That's 2/3 living household. think made big difference younger received final much later potentially stronger immunity present. Interestingly also bigger symptoms/side affects received second dose did. means much. depends less lethal - harmless enough even kill seriously harm vulnerable people, fine. think would even beneficial outcompetes replaces delta case. you’re assuming actually safety.   submission linking thedailybeast.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* information mutation’s structure info is, well, concern (to put mildly).

could explain part? impression ""30 MuTaTiOnS"" media exaggerating something happens viruses. significance sets apart Alpha, Delta, become prevalent area? could shut air traffic, stranding Americans telling come back find way legal. don’t get targeted bans though tbh. Either ban flights none, imo.  child 2 sick. Would make sense testing 13 Yr olds.  got booster yesterday feel fine. whupped second. fret yet ❤️ lot us Americans chip shoulder attention drawn less stellar social aspects. seeing Poland deaths thing And/or  Yes, 10% positive, *after* required present negative antigen test board. 

In best-case scenarios, widespread issue antigen tests, even then, 10% positive among people taken random (who apparently feel good enough travel) disturbing. people saying Lambda Mu going overwhelm us first detected. Bottom line: enough info yet whether outcompete Delta. agree you. Yes, variants identified never really spread enough people talking them. pretty much got competed delta 2 shots still good protection. toy really look breakthrough data nearly high would think compared vacinated population size.

Also vast majority breakthrough hostpital visits 50. would waited couple weeks say that. Best game ever! Thanks contribution anyway. 'Nam Record breaking profits Pfizer Moderna vaccines boosters. tired bullshit they're going keep pushing long they're making money. dont think so, Greece sequenced 40.000 previous PCR tests order look didnt find it. testing 72 hours travel enough. . need test more. Upon arrival. frankly even 5-10 day quarantine safe. kept plane tarmac four hours bused room within airport another ten so. latter period commented masking, specifically note airport officials present nothing it. 

It also period people room began informed many tested positive, though initially learned news reports outside rather anyone airport bothered tell directly first; third present (by estimate) refused mask even receiving information. You’re right general cautious sensationalism, isn’t that. 

As notes statement classifying Omicron variant-of-concern, number mutations known impactful. include, example, E484A, K417N, N440K, N501Y. combination, make contagious general also (theoretically) render antibody immunity whether acquired vaccine and/or prior infection less effective.

Now, true data yet (reasoned) conjecture, seen informed, compelling case explaining things would somehow problematic practice, looking one. I’m supposed visit Christmas starting wonder try bump flight couple weeks make sure get shut downs… want hear somebody else outside South Africa. Taking first trip Europe Wednesday US. Fully vaccinated + booster. What’s likelihood there’s travel ban Wednesday keeps going? sounds miserable, hope feel better soon! People selfish never good judge likely bad things happen them. 

It’s like lottery complex. overestimate chances good things happening us. underestimate chances bad.  South Africa extremely low cases overall, pretty low vax rates. early say whether Omicron outcompete Delta. seems people hard time catching covid. could due previous coronavirus infections lifetime, maybe people really robust immune systems. know scientists super interested people never get sick virus attempting genetic fallacy? worked hackathon funded German government beginning pandemic everybody thought choose it. mostly lobbying work. also took work done people like gave tontwo big tech companies could also install hardware run. got 300 million that. Took months get hardware running instead Outsourcing it. ""data protection"" ofc nothing 300million Also PCR test indicates it’s omicron - that’s countries go back “find” potential cases past weeks. sequencing confirmation takes very, likely omicron PCR report different variant. think pandemic continue lifetimes people alive now! reason believe go away. surge mutate world. Continued vaccination improved therapeutics way forward value lives lives others. Many ignorant millions die take others them. health care systems around world going dire straits foreseeable future. would want work system constantly overwhelmed? live new world now. literally know nothing risk hospitalisation fact SA saying affected people mildly symptomatic people talking lockdowns shutting economies literal fourth fifth time inevitable. mean, cases vairous places like Belgium, Germany, Hong Kong already. Even though found airport, considering human detection slower actual spread, convinced already went worldwide. 


The thing that, Omicron easily distinguishable Delta assume outspreads dominant variants, even reported cases now. missing something here? No. people suspect covid get tests usually - positivity rate skewed represent amount infections actual population. That’s study CDC, it’s discussion existing studies, thanks bothering read. longer scientists say Ni. scientists say Ekke Ekke Ekke Ekke Ptang Zoo Boing. know going topic want gush something gave happiness lockdowns:

I even covered half stuff they've added since launch. post would long. developers even started making temporary story missions called Expeditions show like ""seasons"" get exclusive cosmetics completing them. stuff free. Every Expedition free. paid DLC this, way buy progress real money, Hello Games intends keep way. Man's Sky best space sim game there. I've seen players convert Star Citizen, Elite Dangerous, Space Engineers become biggest Man's Sky fans. much get caught since launch would probably watch 10 hours videos see all. still everyone fills niche audience, I'm happy part niche. data error ~800 cases accidentally entered ~18,000 cases. sure that’s saw. cases rising, *that* quickly yet.  Isn’t Murdoch media well ? Yeah IMO they’re right leaning taste times I'm afraid allegiance Simpsons quote allow reality Hence US considering travel ban South Africa pointless already. Stop releasing Tiger King seasons! self awareness dumb look posting stuff like idiotic people like going look future generations? still 417 rolls left first lock down. Spokanistan always going way behind curve  hope successes transferable aren’t product centuries unique history. Michigan? deff not.   *dab* would, though, right. mean 10% vs 9% people sampled across whole country pretty close. looks like plane load people tracking roughly rate rest country. Aw really appreciate I’m broke unfortunately. would totally go otherwise! FYI sequencing takes time. first 4 sequences (3 full Botswana 1 partial Hong Kong) weren’t noticed late Tuesday/early Wednesday (depending location), still didn’t meet criteria even designation lineage. UK scientist flagged them, Tom Peacock, note mutations concerning flagged them. Here’s happened: additional sequences South Africa found soon thereafter. virologists epidemiologists jumped this.

Most delay getting samples sequenced especially urgency unknown. watching rare sequences uploaded GISAID within first week sampling. Uploads second week, especially early second week, still unusual. Many sequences seem come 3, 4, 5 weeks sampling. sequences don’t get uploaded *months* sampling. Botswana, Hong Kong, South Africa moved *fast* samples. deserve gratitude speed.

Fortunately, like Alpha due mutations, Omicron shows S-gene drop-out one common faster RT-PCR tests. helping monitor spread. S-gene RT-PCR drop-outs presumed Omicron proven otherwise.  I'm going say this. downvote want. I'll admit could wrong. goes:

Some us it. years, months. got vaccinated. Americans do? Many said ""No thanks! care health ability travel!!!""

So guess what? I'm done. I'll get PCR test flight. I'll PCR test fly back. I'm much people are. part. masked. people NOTHING. I'm gonna travel. Sue me. countries variant testing others; South Africa UK two them, variants show there. necessarily they’re originate there. concern people.

This lost him. sister got booster nyc got covid day. Lost sense smell. I’m thinking maybe got new variant. King County Seattle metro super-vaxed, outside much plot twist: met American.

Dredging colonialism Indonesia 70 years ago surrogate substantive socio-economic comparison present displays paucity argument rather strength.

And without considering difference malice stupidity, unfathomable difference scale scope. Dutch app inactivate code try take screenshot, strange Germans think that. Hah... Boosters? area still packed morons get first shot. Well let's wait see seriously doubt it'd lockdown announcement. likely it'll reassurance message address media hype, another ask urging people get boosters.

At most, may initiate Plan B, least say consideration. Beware Fiegl-Doom Michael Osterdoom preserve mental health. play worst case scenario remain relevant. favorite experts Ashish Jha Scott Gottlieb. extremely reasonable. Yeah think people getting cautious anyone math skills know many samples actually sequenced typical country? 

hypothetically 1% positives sequenced high chance low percentage variants missed suddenly pop everywhere, right?"
