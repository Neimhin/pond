Haahahha think New Zealand is? think flights out? think ten people private island something?

America could enacted policy position now. Republicans think murdering citizens worth protect income rich. dropped /s  Weird noone mentions millions young people elbow elbow streets since march. Nope absolutely cant part spike heard plan provide free flu. neither insurance I'm looking get ""there's thing free lunch"" argument, inserting $0.02 looking econ argument. Duh. assume this? wear masks? Lowes shut online phone order pick only? simple answer it’s result aRussian disinformation campaign that’s going six years. weaponized social media push alternate narratives events. spread, ironically, like virus. Happened UK too. Covid deaths. Sweden avoided considerable harms lockdown. look UK. they're ones really setting records per capita someone said harmless. Great messaging. Thanks voting keep status quo profit healthcare. lame article say infected work. children 2 exempt? every chance carrying Covid others Believe me, feel anyone working minimum wage country shouldn’t someone making minimum wage “enforce” something like this. Ideally, manager someone authority. Also, avoiding confrontation/escalation key. It’s really simple. Calmly remind customer mask policy. resistance customer given choice wearing mask leaving. resistance police called. Shouting matches arguments things get hand.  Jeez sub trigger happy downvote things. Except NY locked curb spread places don’t give fuck suppose great leap forward cultural revolutions great successes too? mean else would steal tech industrial secrets around world 50 years try keep up, fucking degenerate CCP shills. Couldnt entire generation liquidated could it? give marriage 2 months.

Depends equally sociopathic. Could match made heaven ( hell) certainly immune fake news, especially due supposed respect experts.

The thing americans balls fucked tribalism us vs mentality. lot actual opinion formed whether guys say stuff loud hast (R) (D) next name guys also watch stick team every fucking piece nonsense.

Your media landscape seems perpetuate giving people want: reinforcement one team condemnation other.
It renders american population unable agree anything would mean somehow 'giving in' team.

Germany immune fake news, immune conspiracy theories. run media landscape based bashing camp, society work like people regardless political orientation interested that.

It might deadlock two party system forces never deviate, I'm sure. way country stuck two camps seemingly regardless content healthy. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* approved one thing.. What's penalty catch lying? ironia Amazing New Indiana beat us it. New (New) Hampshire an, albeit small, movement secede Union since 2016. Live free die (literally according anti-maskers). go get minimum wage job mask enforcer, staff isn’t paid well enough deal threat harm. thing terrifies pandemic itself.  don’t believe it. don’t believe rates rising,” Colburn said. “They’re inflated. It’s another way shutting everything … Democrats trying get want.” 

Terrible numbers today - States reported 70k cases today, third-highest number we’ve seen. country nearing peak level COVID-19 patients hospitalized (~60k). States reported 1,126 deaths, 7-day average 800, back levels June.

California, Missouri, Oklahoma, North Dakota set new records cases today.

From Covid Tracking Project  guys? 
 
Lmao don’t. 
 
“You guys” people believe hospitals get paid Covid deaths.
 looked rate deaths somebody gets put vent? playing semantic games here. 
 
No. I’m not. fact, **you** are, attempt backpedal deflect realize you’re wrong. 
 
Hospitals get paid Covid deaths. Full stop. “Yeah get paid Medicare patient alive, TeChNiCaLLy...”
 said think hospitals fudging numbers, fact get paid somebody covid positive indisputable.
 
What weird thing flat-out lie about, weird place. know previous comments still exist right?
 
I said “They literally think hospitals get money Covid deaths”. response?
 **I mean, true,** think hospitals callous enough fake data get paid. kids' school moving lunch outside least. Plenty vets too! 6 times deadlier flu 40% less deadly thought so? 100% it'd get shot lol they're great relatively speaking moaning money?

It's federally granted economic relief money address global recession/depression pandemic caused. money help county reducing infection rates. I'm really sure confusing.

Regardless, state sued. probably lose, either way, lawyers state county get disputed money. 2016 election would strongly disagree you. support among base dropped significantly, find hard believe truly disagree handled. Oh yeah easy peasy now. saying looked hard enough could find masks even initial spike. everyone acting like first ever coronavirus we’ve ever seen lol Yeah, last time many countries agreed *anything*? Especially something negative devastates economy. zero rational explanation majority *and variety* countries would conspire make seem worse is. Apparently nice smoked fruit bat, served corn bread pudding, burn months months nothing, pretending like there's problem everything fine... point options left.  curious, much Chinese government pay work doing? Definitely true. numbers appear off. 

NY reported 6,500 nursing home residents died COVID (prior 7/15) NY reported 31,500 total deaths. would equal 20% COVID fatalities. Nearly 6% NY nursing home residents died COVID NY. Florida total 5,300 fatalities. aCksually, &lt;pushes that's not... Words! hurt durr one people thinks arte end history,eh. know many dress way I'll bet lot act like it. younger people getting infected right now. use everclear 190. Even higher alcohol content 'rum' flavor left behind. evaporates completely. Cheap too. behalf everyone else thread, fuck without everyone willing part, never going happen. They'll probably throw tantrum like 2-year old get asked wear one too. also largely rely tourism. still front line workers Yeah something wrong that? one knows effects years now, vaccine ever rushed before. People reason little cautious always worried India. many people... got tested last week Los Angeles got results little 48 hours.  Great job Abbot. really fucked one Bolsonaro got lucky seems mild case. anyone believe China ""reports"" anymore? Positive rate peak 50% NYC testing pretty safe say number probably close correct keep CDC getting numbers, magically go away! least there's people brain, feel bad overrun imbeciles feel need bow whims fool runs country. Coronavirus mutate quickly fyi Plentiful amazon.ca now: know 2 months ago. So, fourth point really scares me, haha...ha.

If truly don’t find way help aren’t genetically predisposed better fighting chance covid, then? much going me, can’t 100% sure COVID-19 would manifest severely me, pretty good hunkering will. I’m A+ blood type, several gene mutations create additive risks — chronic inflammation, Factor V Leiden (increased risk blood clots), others. 

I mean, love Darwin, never thought I’d receiving end one. :( creative cause death. covid... drowning. Yeah, lazy update. shut back actually enforce proper use masks see us going shit Texas, Florida, etc. Maybe quite bad seem smaller amount aggressively stupid people (and less people overall), still pretty bad. hope start shutdown that's gone.

Then again, something tells state come decent shape spite itself. Even Warriors blew 3-1 lead Cavs.  we’re counting people wear masks screwed Year year death totals going fucking scary going adjust decrease accident related fatalities going even worse.

""This propoganda make democrats look good trump look bad.""

It's objective fact state somehow propoganda. Weird times. Pretty much impossible. sheer lack food would squashed plan Yale estimated covid deaths 2x official figures.   much winning! Right conspiracy people believe deaths counted COVID nothing it. Like heart attack COVID testing listed COVID opinion. think increase false numbers get money falsely. hear 23 herbs spices work second round antibody/testing survey think fully happened, results yet released. stuff IU public health folks, I've seen little bit data good stuff, although can't recall anything surprising. scheduling little janky, think want vaguely quarterly, ended one late spring, one mid summer, next ones expected like three months line. PhD get able give kind prediction?

Covid stay infect entire population.... Unless live U.S. Trump administration, course. Think every state country. Everyone runs state differently. never heard familial situation Europe two brothers live parents? children get sent orphanages dad's absent parents... problem I’ve come understand one wants admit they’re wrong. girlfriend falls misinformation campaigns daily Facebook gets mad everytime question source (which almost always turns bs) Lifelong asthmatic confirm. absolute worst thing getting enough air panic. need immediate medical attention, going wait it, find distraction, like favorite book, game movie. Listen favorite nostalgic songs take happier time. think breathing, likely make worse. Every critique /r/dataisbeautiful. follow reasoning long enough, show ""Economy important"".  great explanation get frustrated. end saying something like... that(Covid reporting) may happening, even though understand incentive, underreported deaths happening well. fact explained underreported deaths likely, one article read people paying money actually get negative result could go work. either way, numbers never true accurate representation happening, personally like trust historically valid sources information, leads pretty stark conclusions even couple thousand deaths attributed alleged reporting. 

That response friend explaining brother's girlfriend's sister's boyfriend works hospital nurse said counting death Covid even wasn't. also said virus bad government never admit overreacted. got annoyed spoke said piece. Wants spoon garbage like like garbage. 

I just. know. Anyway, thank insight. Incidentally, leader legislators got arrested $60 million bribery case. department announced May 5 news conference 221 employees Tyson Foods pork processing plant Columbus Junction tested positive days earlier, Tyson officials told Iowa workplace safety regulators inspection 522 plant employees infected knowledge, documents obtained open records law show.  
  discrepancy adds mounting questions state health department faces handling public information pandemic. department last week forced longtime spokeswoman, said ousted pushing hard fulfill media requests agency’s delays scripted talking points embarrassing.  
  agency also faced criticism seeking charge thousands dollars open records requests routinely announcing outbreaks workplaces, among things. department said “gone beyond provide up-to-date comprehensive information” public.

Surely low US? mean im one conspiracy nuts, UK couple weeks 2000 deaths per day, yet America, population far bigger ours, 1000, dispite ongoing retarded government response?

to totally honest, probably have... exactly something people advertise... medical problems whole something people tend keep private... anyone else's business. 

you aware mean met them.  many husbands family members died? putting people’s families risk behavior.... family go theme park? 

People gone much much worse history... pause normal life... society can’t even tolerate staying home...smh Twitter 60% bots can't imagine going Twitter this. I'm already losing mind trying get people wear masks mental health hospital work at, UK.


This pandemic thought world literally full narcissistic idiots. But...but...but... heard virus gone November. accidentally wrote ""jung"", German word ""young"" :D Hi, let introduce country, India.  confusing many concepts related scientific method general article particular. sure ignorance deception.

Several people tried explain yet keep bringing misconceptions ""proof"".

To clarify, important starting point: wholly absurd baseless hypothesis published peer-reviewed journal, citations made scientist renown. absolutely baseless product pure fantasy still happen. step scientific method mean hypothesis given credibility. means debunked point process.

The important part method step part proper science, publication may may ""science"" itself. hypothesis properly considered scientifically sound, much needs done. something someone wrote.

Having citations also indicator properly following scientific method (and also saw scientific method part exists separate proper science chaff, is). 

The point citations using established science building blocks new science. citations listed support statements. like saying flapping arms really quick makes fly including citations air density fluctuations, hummingbird muscle chemistry gravity effects water. concepts citations related madness statement, prove anything support it.

A hypothesis start science, prefers sound science building blocks, hypothesis becomes proper theory still science. 

(all ignoring publication editorial even amount hypothesis, foundational statements require huge leaps faith taking unexisting, unproven debunked science several calculations mathematically impossible real world. hospitals worse shape compared what? specifically way? India also recorded 1000+ deaths yesterday. guys crazy there. Europe wear masks. (Sometimes chin, that's another topic) go lives... flying right now, everyone plane, whatever reason, willing get airplane pandemic. people visit dying parents, get fired don't, oblivious think virus liberal conspiracy. median mental age airplane was. really think clicking button app means alert everyone you’ve close contact coronavirus? get physically tested receive positive result access data alert people you’ve around. bosses response, nurse hospital (mental health). complain boss get wear one.  4 two bed rooms, 1 two beds, two ""rooms"" converted old grandfathered sheds back yard one person living room person, mud room person BIL friend technically lives car property room anything still pays money gets food, so... lives too! Lol question... school begin US?... Europe vacations so....


(And can't classes online?) bit lower least compared US, counts city different. Australian cities include outlying areas whereas US tend strict geographic boundary count there. Australian cities high lists differences big first seem

eg phoenix pop density 1222/km2 look phoenix metropolitan area (similar Melbourne would counted) number drops 192/km2  Getting tired winning definitions, Australian Department Health, add absence ""any deliberate intervention disease transmission"".[18] Hospitals would losing big time financially cancelled elective procedures, that's make money 4 million people weekend. pretty easy know get data dor excess deaths unless want tamper cuz i'm lower middle class. ""But they're inflating numbers make money dude! know hospital gets PAID mysterious non-entity every time diagnose case report death!? Like omg Facebook bro seen lack clout."" hospitals worse shape overall deal pandemic. also help past 5 years seen record hospital closures. pretty much point laid starkly. US EU media free say likes. frequently complains government publishes stories would simply safe publish authoritarian regimes. 

The guardian one primary early publishers wiki leaks etc. Whereas Russia journalists fairly frequently disappeared. good example would measures put pace protect 2 russian journalists working panama papers. 

You obviously don’t believe it, we’re talking regime invaded 2 neighbours testing defences least 2 others. used chemical weapons foreign nations peace time, history murdering disagree Putin. regime externally it’s going worse internally. Well well well. isnt consequences actions. pertinent would hospitals reaching capacity (which already are). scenario people would otherwise survive won’t get access treatment death rate spikes massively they've idea decades, waiting reason Lol easier live world made live world could easily die forgot disinfect one thing delivered. 9/11 thing agin. people would rather live world government long term plan control everyone easier accepting there's always chance die randomly without warning terrorist attack. truth matter people, believe whatever allows keep worldview lifestyle. read today 31% americans believe death toll overstated. Well trump lie yesterday say lowest infection rates world... Reddit full masochists also think Canadians especially ones Toronto idiots. mandated rule wear masks social distance, still majority people don’t. Private schools fucking exist first place.  government done amazing job here. Literally going around last 3 months zero worries here. pool party day. Wedding day. Zero worries. fantastic news. I'm Indiana constantly worrying spreading family. sure start fires there, generally think help slow things down. It’s exacerbating shitty data interpretation like White House did. Showing 3,2% death rate half cases still active stupidest metric use create false sense hope. 

US death rate around 7% new spikes, hospitals get overwhelmed probably increase too.

Just sad much still willing skew optics make look better is. US big trouble, start acting like it!  Damn, virus sure exposing lot stupidity America. Get tested. friend dosnt ur partner needs exposed potnetualy. park outside governor's mansion. deaths today

Wow, fake bullshit. Keep crying edits.  Words. Almost like taken time ramp up. long protests hmm month hmm thstd right! italian saw before. almost appointed state epidemiologist several dozens years experience regarding epidemiology Sweden, team hundreds doctors, mathematicians, engineers scientists, knew better ""experts"" hanging r/coronavirus... would expect that? think BC needs send strong message events quickly. Tickets everyone involved way. might feel invincible person walk next grocery store might be. playing stakes people’s lives. Without strong leadership end like USA, we’ve done delay start date.  Almost every place made political, way didn’t involve people dying thousands Person. Woman. Man. Camera.

Economically technologically, sure. Socially, ethically, morally - nope. 9/11 every 3 days holy fuck. Following news US feels like watching movie Idiocracy.. Positive batches get invited back retested individually. ~30,000 ppl work 50's  prayers

 MAN , SEND LEAST SOMETHING. think Prof. Dr. Drosten Berlin Charité Hospital die incredible good job podcasts. 

Especially beginning pandemic. price podcasts. I'm glad. 

I'm sure Stage 4 would effective since cases coming sources would remain open anyway, population density vs NZ incomparable.

Nonetheless, may agree we're stuck one together. 

Stay safe Neighbour. Hopefully future go back normal instead arguing god-forsaken virus internet. People would wear masks got tickets wearing them. We're rich.  Uk ahead medical research instance, first vaccine start stage 3 trials, second strong potential vaccine, establishing dexemethasone effective treatment, research Interferon beta indicates biggest breakthrough far. This, exactly. US, general, bad country live compared else could be. lot things much face-palm-moments *developed* countries.

Yes, US takes 1 million immigrants every year. look come why. Quite lot move US economic reasons, want freedom. US takes lot economic reasons well.

That said, looking Europe, tell I'd rather poor Europe middle class US. Europe would choice taking three jobs starving, one would enough. Illness would ruin financially sons daughters could still study good university without incurring life-long debt. lose job, would social security would prevent starving evicted home... kind security worth lot, IMHO. RemindMe! 30 days It’s actually fine-able Vancouver police asked educate instead write mock tickets. 

I however would love see ticket writing justice kind blatant disregard people’s safety. Musk might run one day, there's still chance interesting dystopia sometime later. convince there’s point voting. Tell Norway Denmark (lockdown) basically zero excess deaths, Sweden (no lockdown) nearly 6,000... They’re definitely B-b-but hold people responsible d-d-decisions made themselves!

That said, Trump could easily recommended mask usage urged governors implemented mask wearing mandates. didn’t. People concerned it.. Michele Obama whole platform 1st lady combat obesity like 2 dozen active cases shores. doubt genomics investigation going on, I'll interested result too.

Recommendations regarding face masks trains relevant Sweden, according state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell. Keeping distance still important measure keep coronavirus infection.


New recommendations European authorities state face masks used rail traffic distances 1.5 meters cannot maintained. State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell points keeping distance still important best measure keep spread infection down. Face masks seen complement - something also European recommendations make clear.


- believe possible keep distance, especially long-distance trains, SJ also adapted this, says.


As previously reported, effect face masks reducing spread infection uncertain. Swedish Public Health Agency continuously monitors issue follows new studies. present relevant update recommendations Swedish trains.


- Especially rapidly declining pace numbers. situation enter new restrictions, states Anders Tegnell.


Stefan Holmlund SJ's press office previously told TT SJ follows Swedish Public Health Agency's recommendations. Instead offering mouth protection, focus booking seats train passengers keep distance.


The train operator MTRX, operates Stockholm-Gothenburg route, offers free face masks passengers. According train operator's CEO, Mats Johannesson, number passengers receiving face masks increasing.


Anders Tegnell reminds face masks justify sick person get train.


- good completely convinced increase risk quite properly, says.


#Facts: Travel recommendations

Since 13 June 2020, asymptomatic people travel Sweden. Swedish Public Health Agency's general recommendations preventing spread infection apply:

Stay home sick.

Cough sneeze armpit.

Wash hands often use hand sanitizer regular hand washing possible.

Keep distance others trip stay, avoid congestion.

Transport companies also responsibility reduce risk congestion limit number passengers per vehicle.

Travel primarily means transport public transport. need travel public transport, choose alternative possible book seat.

For me, I'll wear mask generally obey guidelines find annoying inconvenient, disobeying guidelines increases probability I'll need deal longer. There's care empathy weighing decision, I'm benefits foreseeable future (and happens benefit others, too).

Now, might find cold morally incorrect, whatever. point is, someone cares still obey guidelines benefits them. recognize politicians pander fear panic public allow simply go lives, best way return lives stop fear panic. stop fear panic? exactly guidelines suggest.

So missing? short term pleasure able sit inside Waffle House really worth long term discomfort inconvenience?

It's personalities preventing following guidelines, sheer stupidity. I’ve saying since like February: Civil war 2. It’ll lit. Maybe we’ll see Spider-Man sweet America Ass *r/publicfreakout question even make sense Small note: Germany state TV. got public-service broadcasters. Big difference.

Yesterday 1/10 wearing mask near me; today 10/10. People won’t things except threat law seems. It’s American thing. One way Stop increasing numbers. Big brain time.

""Now, region must split 1,000 tests week area counties. But, Moch said went 800 tests July 21 turn people away."" 

Interestingly, Ireland doesn’t currently allow Denmark Iceland, isn’t purely based infection burden seemingly. think Ireland right thing putting strict limits many countries enter, definitely right thing keeping Swedes [Sweden one countries highest burden infection EU]( fucked man. blood life one fucking party . exist premise denial exist.

#Translation:

Ireland one countries EU lowest spread coronavirus. last two weeks, around five cases per 100,000 inhabitants restrictions released people countries similar spread infection.

This means visitors Finland Norway, among others, covered restrictions.

The list reviewed every fortnight.

#Facts: Ireland's green list

Restrictions 14-day quarantine lifted visitors Ireland following countries territories:

Malta, Finland, Norway, Italy, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Cyprus, Slovakia, Greece, Greenland, Gibraltar, Monaco San Marino. Sadly, think it’s going take enough deaths hit “close home” enough people reach tipping point everyone US finally take seriously.
Stay safe then. Move Rhode Island! (Famously-failed tagline: “Cooler / Warmer” 😜) ... fewer idiots though ;) Exactly. Trump disaster day one simply incapable listening experts subject. He’s always dumbest guy room that’s convinced he’s smartest.

It’s impossible would handle pandemic, national crisis, better has.

Sad. must many sports. Soccer, Baseball, Auto racing around world going without fans.

Damn man hate America much I'm sure China north Korea would love you. It’s ridiculous farce would require keeping many different people quiet there’s way really look it. It’s hospitals work. 

Someone comes hospital, intake immediately adds symptoms computer. go back nurse talks them, adding anything new relevant file. digital files tons people hospital (and I’m sure admin) access see changes made made (at least systems know of. doc comes eval signs whatever prescriptions get sent hospital pharmacy. 

So routine patient intake, that’s half dozen people interacting MINIMUM. pharmacy doesn’t pump drugs either, evaluate files heavy amount input patient care, file says COVID prescriptions don’t match, people getting involved mistake seen. Thats even mention procedures happen someone actually dies, much people hospital talk. 

You’re talking hundreds people point, quite risking licenses malpractice suits, hospital make cash?? hospitals part massive chain that’s huge amount risk already profitable. 

It’s ridiculous misunderstanding anything works it’s massively widespread rumor. People seem lack even grade school level critical thinking can't take one individual extrapolate entirety 200,000. Yes person dumbass, idiots every profession, mean entirety profession way. People acknowledge lifestyle needs change. Make masks fashionable utilitarian. Come different ways socialize instead bar.  America taken things seriously reopened slowly, schools could open up.

But didn’t shouldn’t open up.  Uh... I'm ok dude. missed day work, vacations twice since started you. Hmm. remember mentality back February. understand comes from, amazingly stupid think video might digestible, accompany [this episode Okay Depends America though. lack compassion seeing places like middle America South. Northeast, mask wearing common everyone looks other. NJ, densely populated state, well compared entire country there's outbreak anymore. We're par European countries. Reason being? People listened, wore masks practiced guidelines save lives... words: compassion.

There rallies masks tiny nobody cared them. governor even publicly shamed people. South, well, that's different story... It’s people like cause continue wearing mask even covid. It’s really showed blatantly disgusting “true Americans” are. 3 covid positive patients come ER today. 2 sent home nothing them. room air need admitted. slight cough headache. $40 without insurance. important vaccine free period.

#This year, zero cruise ships expected dock Stockholm. means hundreds millions kronor sales losses restaurant owners, shops businesses.



In normal summer, picture around Stockholm's ports changes. large white cruise ships often moored along Stadsgårdskajen, Värtahamnen, Frihamnen sometimes Nynäshamn. last year, number calls cruise ships 268 Stockholm year, 288 calls booked pandemic struck travel stopped.


- year looks gloomy. forecast right get cruise calls, says Stefan Scheja, cruise manager Stockholm Ports.


According Scheja, one two cruise ships may arrive Germany later autumn. extremely uncertain picture now.


- case, bonus come, says Scheja.


And financially, situation hits Stockholm Ports, municipal company owned city Stockholm. forecast 2020 port lose SEK 70 million result lost port revenues service fees. addition, additional approximately SEK 160 million lost revenue fairway pilotage fees Swedish Maritime Administration involved.


Värtahamnen Stockholm unusually empty summer 2020. single cruise ship plans dock year.


For Ports Stockholm, situation also meant 15 seasonal jobs withdrawn year.


But Stockholm's business community, economic blow tougher that, according Stefan Scheja. 2018, port company conducted survey via marine consulting company GP Wild, showed economic effect cruise calls Stockholm - among things based passengers ship crews spend.


With survey background, Stockholm's business community estimated lose approximately SEK 600 million direct sales year form of, example, missed restaurant visits reduced consumption.


But even though looks bleak, cruise manager Scheja entirely without hope.


- contacts cruise lines, appears majority passengers passengers trips canceled, choose rebook future instead rebooking completely, says Scheja.


For years 2021, Ports Stockholm booked 300 cruise calls 2022, around 250 calls already booked.


- total setback, expect next year receive half 300 pre-booked calls. 2022, expect back 75 percent 2023 level pandemic, says Stefan Scheja.


On US stock exchange, cruise companies Royal Caribbean Norwegian Cruise Line turbulent time behind them. Since turn year, share value fallen approximately 60 75 percent companies, respectively. Lately, however, certain recovery discernible Wednesday last week, two companies' shares rose 20 percent. However, joy short-lived Royal Caribbean's share since fallen 9 percent Norwegian Cruise Line around 20 percent. Hmm. won’t buying masks. dead covid still looks happy! need trust God... 

- real... 
- judge... 
- jealous

🥓🥓🥓 Praise bacon mid July already, talking oven heat?   mean, winter Brazil. isn’t like winter US/EU, it’s still “hot.” yeah, we’ve absolutely known heat won’t entirely kill off. hope right everything Damn. locals need win this. hope fishing charters get closed Induction scary contracted virus attending training Honolulu HQ.

Shut training? Since article visual reliant charts display data, highly recommended get translation plug browser read site itself. also see [a report details region]( Taking ability report away CDC.... Unless licensed healthcare professional shut it. Lockdowns require federal support. There's one ballot, federal capacity, wants shut state.

And November, voting actually occur, late.

Electoral politics going solve problem. snake oil seller. He‘s usual corporate asshole doesn’t care anything money power.  close friend mine this. wife medical insurance; would difficult one providing benefits family. said there'd likely lot openings next year, cynical, he's probably right. can't wait see people like absolutely lose minds Biden implements nation wide lockdown national mask mandate January. dragged kicking screaming catch every first world country. American right cracks up. ridiculous. saying Genital warts. Got it. According googling, daily deaths pretty close 1/10 daily births US. pretty scary. Stay safe everyone.  Flight attendants contracted covid higher rate general population, suggesting air travel particularly dangerous. There's reason shut air travel.   Source one? 13 year old i'm thinking testing negative covid ""covid symptoms"" wrote whole article Trump right. testing = confirmed cases.

(More confirmed cases mean sick) Coz testing causes cases duh

/s

but seriously seeing testing numbers plateau/decrease like disconcerting. be, reality won't. Best case see step get voted none face type charges lawsuits this. they're closed Sundays. cases less days.... Please pray us. living brother desperate US. Nobody cares. never felt panicked life. Please pray. almost killed pressure. Please pray, beg you. Asymptomatic essential still working dependent company industry seems.

Where works, positive non-antibody type test automatic 14 day paid vacation symptoms not. One first people positive came work got results got results work. entire shift sent home, facility deep cleaned sanitized, everyone shift test negative returning work.

The animal hospital thing concerns me. explained consistent. fact, article linked great job explaining opinions changed relevant clear data available.

If expecting someone position stick rigidly  initial messaging facts change, that's insane. Consistency applies within constraints. May Rona you. DC well. Even apartment buildings—you fined $1k outside personal residence without wearing one. countries took seriously. Look country next line behind US covid cases/deaths... Brazil. common? Maybe president willing take pandemic seriously? Bolsonaro trump downplayed severity pandemic populations suffered died. many daily tests running? Unfortunately them, people picked definitive side almost 4 years. 

I'm saying people swayed, are, think less previous year history. 

If arent team Trump already highly unlikely swayed numbers dont trust begin with. 

Not masses enough determine election. feeling better plans rig election though. wont put past them. opposite. labeling deaths occurred things listed covid deaths instead heart attacks, kidney failure, pneumonia, etc positive covid. Wtf coronavirus wrong means people die businesses hit even harder. Even Trump took right precautions, would still high death count. Doesn’t anybody get that? 48 hrs CT course. got stay TV. don’t get instyle photo shoots good news.  people keep saying narcissism driving it.

it isn't.

what really is, maliciousness. wants virus ""wash country"". thinks better americans die. it'll make boss happy. world decide business majors charge everybody else?

That’s got Governor ducey. Oh god  GET VOTE. United States one blame current shit show themselves. Rise Up. Vote. Use common sense. nation told countless times NEED VOTE. Ok? That's businesses buddy. Welcome real world. businesses care making money. government supposed goals money. I’ll repeat edit here. It’s also difficult quantify deadly kids schools open full capacity raging infections. America determined lead country deaths, even it’s kids. 

All countries reopened schools actually closed, much lower infection rates we’re going America. study tell bad be. we’re ignoring lot science blindly say “kids physically go back school period, exceptions.”

There better ways. Distance learning isn’t great, it’s safer. least get vaccine better understanding. severity COVID almost certainly bad years road, need careful meantime. thing meaningless death.  I've seen lots comments Facebook. usually little out, like, ""My friend's uncle"" ""the brother guy work with."" [There 29 Chick-Fil-A stores accoding 2012 data link. probably added since then. [There 181 McDonald's data undated, possibly old. 


Regardless, outbreak almost 20% Chick-a-fils, less 1% McDonalds. probably statistically significant. possibly difference type employee gets tested cooperates contact tracers, think much difference fast food workers. There’s still sizable population works labs. don’t see non-lab workforce teleworking problem? Ya'll alarmist.

The dead dream. nightmare. source assuming? deniers, probably anyone totally isolating, probably know asymptomatic case come contact one. least they've passed store street. know make huge proportion cases. workplace started getting tested every week, like 15 first week. We've new 5 6 every week far. shut disrespectful fuck. that""buffoon"" got 4 yeats with. keep crying. China great example, look Rates places like UK, Italy, Spain get idea Kansas 1 like 2 days   much winning! Oh wow fear mongering check out!!!!!! Nothing fear Unfortunately reason, became political. Fox-news-watchers like father convinced gov. new york sent COVID patients nursing homes express purpose increase death totals, death obvious cause recorded covid death. may sound ludicrous, trumpists sounds like tangible malicious goal carried corrupt politicians right everyone's noses. 

 Every day wake harrowing stories ICUs filled new records death occurring everywhere deal later almost complete denial issues. 280 million? They're attempting maintain power pandemic. hope enough people go broke die dilute voters energized them. gay Jew I'm generally biggest fan Roman Catholic nuns, go website find nuns pretty much help poor homeless people. also focus environmentalism climate change. anecdotal common sense. sure formal study research paper I'm working on.

but people fight interests. especially they're desperate.

Desperate unemployed people fight unemployment benefits less benefits essential workers. I'm really sure controversial this. makes us think inject us going different . Tells killer cells reason don’t forget! illogical think immunity doesn’t work naturally saying going work inject WH response: ""Yes."" can’t imagine frustrating would spend life becoming leading expert infectious disease get borderline obese Buffoon tanning toggle tan lines think override expertise successfully identified picture elephant cognitive test.

uhhh let us know risks back march. Dumb fucks. governor basically said kids sacrificed looks good DC schools opened time countries see governing party/official (president, prime minister etc) seen big increase popularity past months.

Case point, literally yesterday, friend called 11:12 morning let know wife tested positive. 3:58 PM got word ran test came back negative. 50% Yelp's restaurant listings gone bust already, surge another lockdown could kill lot more. nightmare whole sector. RemindMe! 2 weeks puts number recorded deaths since virus became known 49 times amount dead 9/11. Yet somehow conservatives wanna downplay Covid-19 still? home-based Scavenger Hunt

I would kill live stream suffer nonsense. Thanks keeping meticulous records throughout this. Always look forward new hospitalization chart particular. Things looking grim couple weeks ago hospital data extremely encouraging general past 7-10 days. 

I genuinely think county/city mask mandates made difference seeing results people maybe getting sick still, receiving less viral load needing medical intervention. Dont know? youre fighting noble cause virus respects that.

""Black Lives Matter"" - Protestors

""No Lives Matter"" - COVID USA NUMBER ONE BABY LETS GOOO give us yet area Chick-Fil-A actually seemed diligent wearing masks keeping curbside pickup drive thru. I've written several chains lack mask compliance. never offer solutions

Oh want solutions? SOrry realize actually listening.

USPS: Stop fucking defunding putting Trump crony charge trying dismantle inside.

CDC: Stop taking data away them, let jobs, stop telling people trust them.

Healthcare: Medicare funded taxes 1%.

Education: Get rid Trump crony start funding them. How? Defund military. We're wartime bruh, take trillions put education.

And preventative care early education shown time good investments pay HUGE returns lowered cost taxpayers less incarceration, medical issues line, crime, welfare, etc. money care instead actively investing happy populace good work good lives, STILL best investment.

Bam, solved. profit sharing? WHAAAAT??? /s Confirmed magic word. Nobody knows true hospitalization rate let tell something. It’s way lower 1% know why? denominator gets bigger, result lower. country full selfish morons education system sucks. education system sucks easier Republicans convince stupid people vote interests. non paywall link:  Rosenheim put patients surrounding hospitals well. tell fuck off

Yeah really point arguing willfully ignorant. wheat overblown hoax?


/s Good point, yeah good look  think going election paying attention. trump didnt win popular vote first time, think hes going bumble election this? 

he wants covid peak november, hes obviously going try emergency power shit cancel election. none make sense legal cause spineless house/senate let happen too. Data great it. don't, use common sense make educated assumptions. Attacking workers enforcing government regulations temporarily allowed considered hate crime duration pandemic.  can't personal stuff they're working spouting online. like 3 plane crashes day. many cases. know that. pretext reduce testing improve numbers election. I'm worked all, chilling, laying couch dog waiting Yankee game. many could confirm actually unemployed? making judgment people based comment section. saying people based comment section type energy karen saying vaccines cause autism Facebook page said so. Trailers gonna sound nice lotta people corona job market. going lie, stings bit know truck stop public health administration is. going do?  Exactly, that’s problem. people don’t trust listen experts, period. “I’m expert everything” trump overconfidence. America’s unique combination celebration confidence (irrespective relation reality) defiant individualism combined deficient education system made capital Dunning-krugerville. 65% Americans believe they’re average intelligence. No.....my math wrong. would 370 .00001 upsetting me. one punished this?!


Rhetorical question.. CDC denounced US lol, never said smart past tense study used data collected March April speak behavior past time period.  troll sell Steaks, Booze, Casinos, Football Americans. science anybody followed (and doing) back January February anti-science probably white racist too! /s

Edit: /s sarcastically challenged Someone yesterday tried claim PCR designed used testing. I, tragically, PR lurker.

Then joined Reddit laugh stupid Americans. “Outdated understanding” generous take happened. exactly 0 research suggest wearing even simple cloth mask would effectiveness wearing nothing that’s narrative put forward months we’re dealing public perception problem generated. 

But think people thread focused mask blunder relation comment rather overall attitude Fauci took speaking White House briefings vs attitude he’s sidelined. It’s amazing happen you’re longer concerned appearances relation scientific data. it’s situation facts ground changed... many places country, including California one enlightened approaches handling this, steady trajectory upwards regard infections since began. We’ve known aerosolized virus since February thanks research coming China. ignored findings. refused use tests. didn’t enforce protective measures ramp PPE protection. systemically failed response it’s politicians responsible. Neither N95.. help stop them. ever go inside truck stop Love’s. Good them. 100% true South.

I'm glad folks trying defend low-wage workers, that's great. get hired Chick-Fil-A, least town, die-hard evangelical Southern Baptist. make bad people. guess.  Nah okay, even comes Arby's sauce.  Ah mentioning countries' stats relevant supports argument?

I mean, agree you, that's really bad argument tried make there.  I’m NJ cases somewhat control. Got tested last Friday, haven’t heard results yet. Even isn't, partially effective vaccine would drastically reduce spread god. typed last two sentences family member. can't people better one replied to?

You know question. mean stupid idea begin with, however, someone trying implant microchips us... exactly would say. wouldn’t admit questioned. fact spend time debunk insane. use feel like complicated. believe mostly CEO board problem. Otherwise hire regular random people street trying get paycheck many people fall categories Chick-fil-a against. impossible days perfectly good things economical, ethical, etc unless decide live earth isolation.

If choose patronize totally fine, perfect solution this. Wish could fix home. Unfortunately, 40-50% Americans seem perfectly content shitting middle living room leaving there.

How fix idiocy/ignorance people can't bothered anything interests?  would love someone convinced Trump Durian might prevent Covid-19. I’m UK USA, got tested end April government promising 100,000 tests day. ‘tests’ included ones mailed people include return envelopes statistical chicanery. wife classed key workers (nurse teacher, even though schools closed teachers still went every day teach disadvantaged children children key workers). took three weeks get results back, naturally came back inconclusive. right, pandemic hit countries much earlier, less known disease. Internal symptoms, like blood clots, known yet treated. symptoms deadly. Therefore today every patient hospital Covid19 blood thinning medication.

It advancement medical knowledge saved US higher death rates. look states hit earlier (New York, New Jersey), see higher death rates well. number cases gone 95 99% Europe, nothing like seen US now. study showing trauma anxiety drive hunger mechanism seek calorie dense foods. case, ice cream dense fat sugar, perfect craving. 

This old impulse evolved with. We're still ~200 cases population 15million.

For comparison, Florida population 20million ~10,000 cases per day. almost like they're learning entirely new organism interacts world organisms real time! Yeah, you’re tired winning. people's lives important anything else we'd stay home live bubbles Average Joe gonna get left holding bag eventually. 16 pounds two months amazing! Awesome work, man! healthier were, keep getting healthier! Yea I'm almost enlightened you. know I'll go knowing posted said public forum another forum. pain feel indescribable. Link tho. thrive hate. helps balance self hate. reported mysterious illness January 9th U.S. declared first public health emergency January 31st, enabled funding test development. federal government investigating developing tests, traditional ways things slowed progress. unlikely Clinton would able anything different avoid this. administration President Donald Trump tripped government rules conventions, former officials public health experts say. Instead drafting private sector early develop tests, South Korea did, U.S. health officials relied, customary, test kits prepared U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, proved faulty. Then, sticking time-consuming vetting procedures, U.S. Food Drug Administration didn’t approve tests CDC’s Feb. 29, five weeks discussions outside labs absence enough kits, CDC insisted weeks narrow criteria testing, recommending person recently China hot spots contact someone known infected. result, federal government failed screen untold number Americans missed opportunities contain spread, clinicians public health experts say.


Trump listen experts. February 29th Dr. Fauci telling American people need change behavior yet. March 15th, 50 governors declared kind emergency states. 

The early actions distinctly American, besides empty rhetoric, little Trump himself. mechanisms would played absence Trump. Uh-oh... Looks like 80% white Americans screwed. 👏 Yeah they're hitting testing limit. head LabCorp right, spreading faster tested. Making positive tests almost meaningless. Arizona assume everywhere point. Coronavirus taught world importance high standard comprehensive education. guys think COVID-19 change society 5+ years now, vaccine? stuff see stay/permanently change society? people cite separately, site top fifty specific causes state. single days covid would partway list. total, yes, far highest sure forgot don’t understand you’re looking at.

Masks stop virus, right article see every mask tested blocked amount particles.

One virus isn’t enough cause infection, takes whole lot virus make serious infection, mask cutting viral loading effective.

Is cloth mask good idea someone contact ton virus particles?

No.

But general public?

Absolutely. Abstract
We propose novel approach understanding COVID-19. Detrimental outcome antioxidant enzyme deficiency synergism SARS-CoV-2 virus bacterial pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae likely cause COVID-19-associated mortalities. age, production antioxidant catalase enzyme, catalyzes decomposition hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) water oxygen, tails off; result, H2O2 starts accumulate body. Additional production H2O2 bacteria increases H2O2 concentration critical level respiratory tract. elevated H2O2 causes damages lungs oxidizes key components innate immune system, halts inflammasome activation process, eventually suppresses it. dysfunctional innate immune response along significant lung damages, synergic viral-bacterial co-infection leads fast colonization pathogens respiratory tract, triggers overreaction adaptive immune system results hyperinflammations lungs. tested validity proposal analyzing recent clinical data COVID-19, age- gender-dependent COVID-19 death rates, H2O2 accumulation antioxidant enzyme activities cells, correlation antioxidant-rich intake COVID-19 death rate various countries. Based analysis, might possible explain COVID-19 peculiarities including innate immune system fails, infected people develop severe respiratory illness, older people affected most, male death rate significantly higher female death rate, certain comorbidities related COVID-19 mortality, Asian countries low death rates. anticipate proposed mechanism might uncover mystery COVID-19 may pave way finding cure vaccine coronavirus pandemic, understanding viral-bacterial co-pathogenesis related respiratory tract diseases. wait untill big companies start readjusting budgets long term plans reassess real estate going use. one talking about?

You support people anti-vaccine, though, right? consistent view handling Covid19, think be. Years ago heard/read/ made paper, regardless size thickness never folded half 7 times... need new plan getting sun. pieces paper...
EDIT - thanks American high school student, Britney Gallivan, know paper folded seven times, much - Gallivan currently holds world record paper-folding at 12 folds in single sheet (toilet) paper. paper-folding hard? Mar 24 2016
Makes proud human hey.... advances making society remarkable New York never ran ICU beds hospital ship brought saw like total 100 patients. like Texas still 1k ICU beds open read article Sorry. looked recently? Haha course theres still planes flying around I'm Portland literally another day here. Theres 1.8 million people metro area one going give shit thousand protestors. Except care cause fucking Gestapo rolled in. actual paper/research (which conducted economists???) they’re reporting hasn’t submitted peer review, it’s literally printed first page it. It’s nothing r/theydidthemath post PDF written people completely different domain. could completely valid it’s scrutinized actual review board, shouldn’t take proof anything. AFAIK, depends cloth mask pocket filter insert not. plain cloth mask still beneficial since shortens travel anything breathe out, doesn’t really filter particulate matter. Countries never got hit hard dropped too, obviously without herd immunity. Norway, Canada many others. even 6 months symptoms getting worse?

Shit. - People getting positive test calls actually tested.
- Unused tests coming back positive. Human. people

The difference countries functional government make sure things anyway going hilarious Trump dumps DeSantis. DeSantis wanted follow Trump's insanity, fails he's going get blamed. kinds people complain summer kids home &amp; can’t wait school start again.

My mom actually loved summer worry getting sister ready school every morning. I'm saying make kind point, comment simply reminded anecdote. mean washable, cloth reusable masks? What's wrong those? Omg thought r/coronavirustx. I'm terrified. live near area red zone arranged kids go hide Texas family space here. much better here, lot safer, feel like sent kids fucking fire pit cant get back safely weeks. pray, every moment, none get hurt need hospital. told family treat home much possible taking hospital since normally policy ""call call 911 wheels already set motion treated"" ""dont second guess, take in"". ... implemented Obama...

You mean bill enacted Republican congress Obama little control over?

The bill Obama threatened veto unless toned (And was)?

The bill Obama *still* voiced concerns signing?

... *that* implementation talking about? honestly think humans getting used wearing masks something shoot for, even outside covid. many illnesses, wearing mask sick (even colds) could lot good us overall. Like southern hemisphere seeing SIGNIFICANTLY, almost impressively, decreased flu cases year. benefits outside covid, too. Yet still getting decent amount americans somehow stream air goes via small valve much bigger pressure breath single cloth mask face. that's small difference. hand - valve probably catches droplets since hit inner side valve leave it. main risk others get infected via aerosol transmission, case cloth mask only, guess? can't think differences.
I need try setup (n95 valve, additional cloth mask top that). should.

If businesses healthy enough take care themselves, go business make room businesses actually serve public.

People different people, arbitrary inanimate constructs designed limit liability. Damn that’s weak shit, don’t give like that. Work adapt, ancestors literally worked billions years get genes you, want give this? Cmon what? America lies Venezuela time. believe now?  
World’s biggest oil refineries btw I'm sure religiously affiliated hospitals would never abuse ability judge someone's lifestyle choices ... [Justin Trudeau Stop falling unsophisticated propaganda. spike NYC Boston all. protests, explain that? difference is, neither Boston NYC allowed indoor dining bars.

I believe that, yes probably spread due protests, pales comparison millions people eat inside restaurant drink inside bar pandemic. would anyone want eat pandemic? Gross. website absolutely unusable mobile. hell, 5 overlays, ads, scrolling video player. comment cured covid  Sounds like friend making shit. he's making statements, ask proofs

Ps number three compare Sweden Finland Also, Florida 5 child deaths 28,087 child cases. Assume actual cases 10 X 28,087, works 1 child death every 56,174 cases. pretty close 56 million school age students US, exposed, could expect child death toll around 1,000. What? masks less effective simple cloth mask. Official sources said so. 

Also isn’t breaking news. People saying use valve masks months.

Source CDC: respirator exhalation valve used source control?
Respirators exhalation valves protect wearer SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, may prevent virus spreading wearer others (that is, may e$ective source control). data available describe e$ective respirators exhalation valves preventing spread SARS- CoV-2 wearer others:
Wear respirator without exhalation valve source control respiratory protection required. respirator exhalation valve available source control needed, cover exhalation valve
with surgical mask, procedure mask, cloth face covering interfere respirator !t. “

They tend efficient service fast food joints, least South, give that. president pandemic dangerous respiratory virus, top health expert tell country wear masks call drug reduces mortality 0% gold standard treatment. controlling trump? It’s worth trying find sources 1,3,4 true. source article?  NIH using nicotine replacement covid therapy ACE2 blocking also nicotine effective anti inflammatory shows results lowering severity autoimmune cytokine storm response. jalapeño bites bronco berry sauce would disagree.

In seriousness though, Arby’s isn’t good job masking. went today craving roast beef jalapeño bites drive thru attendant mask nose. Chick Fil much better proper mask wearing. since refuse treat like livestock maintain, things occasionally collapse around us. BEST CHRISTMAS EVAAAAAAAA Try “More people died last year March-July compare year 140K COVID-19 deaths”

I argue zero people died COVID-19 last year. aggregate cancer aggregate cardiovascular disease course.

COVID doubt #1 specific cause death. Yes, people sensitive whenever someone suggests MAYBE ways deal virus complete shutdown... honestly, entering building mask, terrorist engaging potential biological attack.. dangerous ones shot, way around. funny ask that.  Because, do. would send home morphine drugs, drugs start get scarce.  NY/NJ kinds drugs became scarce sheer numbers dealt with.  one thinks that. need ride Oregon Australia decompress point. Oh yeah, second spike happened imaginary version new york head explains Florida breaking records new york dropped ~1000 cases/day “We won’t save lives, we’ll NCAA football!” country’s priorities screwed, hey, gets masks faces, greeeaaat. Midwest, Southern, Western states want shut states East coast affected. doubt states handling virus well would want shut due others' mishandling.   There's quite few, homeless people make relatively small portion population begin likely others trouble accessing testing medical care, hear shutdown sets peak. shutdown peak, keeps getting worse people stop going own. lots apologies? used blame God flood. coming. America track another 1000+ day. Sad stuff, could controlled virus initial NY wave.  kind magician parents willing listen advice instead thinking ones advice give?

Parents listening advice kids, they’re still “their children” tale old time instead computers went entirely paper? seems like step wrong direction? “How politics, inequity, complacency undermined Texas’s fight Covid-19” Pearl Harbor. Nobody surprised, sadly. states gonna show rest us lockdown recession better choice reckon. guys, Russia Brazil. Making Boris Johnson look good since March 2020 Nobody going lose benefits union says teachers come work anyone loses benefits. simple. hand masks social distancing. requires working together. working together seems country uncapable of. letting us know? Texas toxic combination inextricable linked culture individualism laissez faire style government. work public health emergency requires collective action. wish. Florida learn Rick Scott 8 years. It’s infection rate 13x reported it’s harmless flu bullshit listen epidemiologists. know, actual experts? Noted. None buildings safe, Las Vegas casino worst all.

Consider elevators. One person took one elevator ride, resulted [71 getting sick. infected air lingered elevator.

Infected air also lingers public bathrooms. [Toilet spreads virus. every bathroom casino vent outdoors? think so. can't think reason aerosol particles would picked toilet plume spread around building.

But worst thing Las Vegas is, happens Vegas stay there. People acquire virus take home spread around rest country. Las Vegas cesspool disease. needs close stay closed duration pandemic. Actually lost coordinated leadership. Fun fact. Testical shrinkage reported. I'll one better, here's article it!

 

I reply questions statements regarding though. clearly lady buffalo, disingenuous actual buffalos. wtf Education strong causative factor political ideology: Parts U.S like past Biff got Almanac thought future Biff liberal nutcase trying brainwash decided bet opposite Almanac results prove they're free want. recover fine.

Maybe little brain damage, reduce lung capacity, ect. people arguing thread Lowe’s saying wouldn’t require employees enforce masks. said “Safer wear mask social distance customers confront risk getting assaulted.” You’d shocked many people expect low-wage employees training gatekeep customers. It’s smart. kids! talk to?? Obama nothing mean diseases combined killed far fewer Americans covid legal advisor Seal team make 2007, DeSantis reported Naval Special Warfare Command Group Coronado, California, assigned SEAL Team One deployed Iraq troop surge ***Legal Advisor SEAL Commander***, Special Operations Task Force-West Fallujah. everyone know wears mask, regardless political affiliation. Absurdities draw comments too, yes… appreciate creative techniques TN utilized encourage mask usage. Fines jail time seem counterproductive right now.  Lets forget Bill Lee TN. man sure knows moronic disagree, nothing happy education kids received public teachers public schools. Maybe problem US. Canadian, health care system (generally) awesome. I'm sorry hear cannot achieved United States. moon thing guys `70s super cool though. video 45 minutes long, article summation. watched video. get stuff? Herd immunity strategy every single novel virus save few. itself, way dangerous, unethical, unwise. He's pure panic. complete evil cowardly piece shit it. deserves one inflated. It’s gonna gooch certain. obvious rocket science. totally sucks even wear masks, follow protocols, we're still risk chose make political argument. 

The lack response political argument. Masks science not. 

Shame people putting rest us risk. blood hands, yet still deal irresponsibility loss life effect everyone. careers. (Require six years schooling numerous certifications). even commenting whether don’t “deserve” pay, simply teachers complain they’re broke, yet comment implies $100 hour would pay cut. 

I’ll get downvoted low blow comment (but I’ll take it): 


“Turns aren’t babysitters.”


Millions parents want go back work can’t afford childcare: “Aren’t you?” dad's home county several family members fall I'll due covid. 

Now tropical storm might hit region making things way worse. one thing we've learned 2020 value bars much schools.  think problem risk assessment flawed, tbh.

I think they're actively trying hurt children. think think kids safe and, immune, would potentially face mild illness.

And medical staff, general, really believes necessary everyone else wear mask, necessary wear one times they're public.

One explained as, ""I'm extremely hygienic careful. never get flu. get this, either."" i'll gone till november Academy said “one first universities nation entire student body campus end July.” say like they’re proud... Big Brain USA playing long game bragging rights. near future rest world complaining bracing second wave, USA get brag country world without second wave.**because got first time around** Well, fat Actually, are. two coworkers week testing. One negative, one pending. called *someone* check them, ask need food delivered, checking symptoms, etc. assume test positive, calls continue data collected contact tracing. one tests positive, company contact tracing work. guarantee blow halftime lead year 1 day, earned $0.01

After 1 year, earned $705 quattuortrigintillion, 7.5 x 10\^107 (for reference, googol 10\^100), $705 billion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion. better comparison:

The way US handled pandemic exactly US approaches healthcare. Full stop.

We hardly preventative medicine. doesn’t make enough money. shit already broken fire, that’s healthcare system steps slaps big bill. lot counties Mexican border pretty bad puts perspective it’s even worse there. quite close. EU also extensive network public transit YouTube Facebook told he's liar would helpful. would really burden school district's finances would think, especially considering President said would revoke federal funding districts re-opening. moron's willful incompetence act violence people Florida. You’re still misunderstanding things. There’s two truths here, you’re wrong, don’t understand we’re discussing deaths, think amount severely sick patients getting tested flattened lessened even us seeing doubling cases, can’t really convince differently. 

We’re break yesterday’s Tuesdays death count today it’s highest since late May. large part deaths attributed infection Father’s Day weekend. We’ll continue see rise time snopes says ""as july 17th"" would agree  healthcare system government knows old everyone is. People underlying conditions doctors conditions. healthcare system overall knows people are. quite rocket science.

It's going guidelines coming government, health agencies, insurance companies healthcare companies implemented doctors actually treat patients. Assign risk patient based medical history, prioritize based that. wouldn’t trust Vox explain basic addition me

~Mr. Tightwater can’t decide. many great candidates “Negligent Mass Manslaughter Governor Year.” many possibilities, unfortunately. think large, indoor classes would biggest spreader worry.

If bars frats concern, know schools allowing sports. Even dumb ones know bad idea. going ton ""unknown respiratory failure pneumonia complications"" resulting death... covid deaths. Please show coronavirus 0.1-0.3%. Oxford Epidemiologists fumble IFR large number??? fumble something simple ya think maybe maybe rest article complete bullshit well??? would recommendation, well. certainly reduce oxygen levels certain conditions. correct?

That's technically correct, say would misleading since people running wind sprints N95 masks. 

In normal use walking around, mask reduce oxygen levels. intense exercise, mask might exhaust respiratory system faster normal, causing drop blood oxygen sooner normal. 

""Breathlessness"" running mask likely due increased load diaphragm, blood oxygen levels. could discharge home Oramorph prescription. get nurse involved home care.

Of course would never fly multitude reasons y'know. Fan fucking tastic I’m sorry. 

I assume she’s also active Facebook? seems part cult formula.  mean stats show children aren’t dying mass states really anywhere muskrat

I love there’s something you’re probably expert in. China gains influence world. US Trump really worried China's influence, they'd taking lead pandemic response helping poorer countries. Germany's healthcare response pandemic decentralized. idea hardly limited anarchocapitalism. washing hands? 

Stop spreading half truths NYT published two months ago. surfaces contact people droplets land 100% vector. might vector 24 hours metal plastic could week depending temperature sunlight. 

I legitimately don’t understand people ignore common sense find one article supports point. it’s main vector mean it’s vector.

CDC link... unintentional confusion caused week article. go, blurb, 3 weeks NYT reference:


The virus may spread ways
It may possible person get COVID-19 touching surface object virus touching mouth, nose, possibly eyes. thought main way virus spreads, still learning virus spreads. think say Americans whole. 80% wearing masks suggestion neck woods small city leans conservative liberal state. high education rate, though, think makes difference.

It's 20% ruins rest us, hate people say Americans stupid! good people. Oh error. purpose. make mean whatever want mean put click bait title left makes even less sense. Viral circulation right now? Wouldnt encourage mask use virus wide open, like hospital maybe? Florida cases per 1mil pop: 18,152.

California cases per 1mil pop: 10,772.

Florida deaths per 1mil pop: 257.

California deaths per 1mil pop: 204.

Florida tests per 1mil pop: 149,698

California tests per 1mil pop: 171,550.

California less cases, less deaths, despite testing per person. Season bad leadership? Stop trying push bullshit worldview. That's stop. believe amount small. working around someone it, amount exposure lot higher, masks not. Six months ago, infectious disease experts saying insufficient evidence closing schools would reduce spread. seemed unintuitive time, reasoned ""kids get together outside school, outcomes same.""

Something evidently changed expert recommendations.  “Erupted” people service animals? Anyone got tl Dr original comment? deleted Don’t need expert say schools shouldn’t open rampaging pandemic.... don’t need degree come conclusion? said “People flying non essential reasons retarded”. pretty severe asthma. Struggle N95. fine surgical mask. lot people saying psychologically cannot handle it. Okay cool. know cure is? Exposure therapy. 

If breathing bad can't breath even basic surgical mask, business pandemic. live here, happened??? Bacterial infection face. It’s I’m supposed wear mask. 

Guess what. wear mask. need minutes day. can’t put salve I’m done errands. takes bit planning Burnt lips? winning U.S. plenty selfish idiots treat virus like joke care, bother taking precautions wearing mask public. attitude mixed stupidity pervasive country. I'd tired saying ""wear mask, social distance, wash hands thoroughly"" again. They’re Huston area. It’s isolated. It’s sickening stuff they’re sharing. Unfortunately attacked much anti-maskers make Instagram private. Winter...ah. Sounds like need get used wearing mask times indoors, too.  Say ""Bye, Bye"" grandma grandpa party sweetheart!"" I'm Canadian, laughing, we're staring shock. knew decade ago masks work

this new virus, knew shit. boyfriend always says : 

""Don't count chickens hatch"" 

2 weeks ago everyone kept saying ""it's fine deaths low"" are. university graduated May plans resume in-person classes starting early August, Arizona. sure one going work out. need ""What fuck??"" emojii. lost muscle limb strep. joke True. Checkout tighter, meat department colder. knows. Hope ok. like everybody else mom's memory care facility (not town) amazing early on. positives workers residents. Small facility, makes difference, probably. I'm really worried coworker tested positive - long symptoms begin person covid contagious? two weeks incubation period right? interacted 5 full days symptoms started worried be?  guess hit nail head there. people survive, system needs change. system survive, die children inherit stunningly incompetent gloriously corrupt system! 

Now get back work, nothing see here. let us ignore little 💀💀💀 earn big 💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸💸   Japanese study hypothesized back March. tried harder contain this. also remove practical knowledge technology wise society. reverse, airline cannot make accommodation essential someone access medical care, serious litigation well. teacher, even though masks mandatory grades, can’t provide student services can’t tolerate mask. accommodate somehow. honestly asking, activities ok right now? I’m really confused people know leading normal life. Yes wear masks meet, 20 people wearing masks indoors hang two hours - considered safe?

I know people driving vacation spots getting hotel. think I’m losing sanity there’s much misinformation. go walks, occasionally see friends, that’s far others said, receptor(s) (ACE2) virus nose, lungs, blood, etc. digestive system would annihilate finds anything latch onto start reproducing body.

Food born illnesses different Covid.

Line cooks, meat packers, fruit pickers, grocery workers, etc breathing food point production. We'd caught virus survived infected people food.

Wash hands eat, touch face, wear mask public. USAFA 4000 total students

Just add on: Right now. wash couple hundred first couple months.  replaced next year. Testing held back bit, still doubt see average 2000 per day. Right bit plateau cases. call hostess bars??? basically saying want mandated masks **stores** others less forced go places (there certain alternatives also understand everyone utilize them). would agree masks public settings optional then? people could possibly come contact virus would others setting. ones actually care Covid begin with.

take example, earlier today saw post group people presumably downtown Nashville street without masks. Would reasonable say people fine setting others without masks, clearly none actually care getting Covid? people going spread to, others downtown Nashville walking around. 


it's safe say find downtown Nashville walking sidewalk following proper guidelines risk exposure potential Covid spread.

&amp;#x200B;

If comes ""well workers exposed"" think that's fair argument given government quite literally mandated certain business un-essential even give choice many people, would otherwise gladly work environments. dunno...that sounds like something someone wants microchip people would say.  Maybe need *slow testing down* Brother, (or sister?) got beef you. I’ve made point, stand it. see differently that’s that. giving another perspective consider, interest hearing out, let’s agree disagree move on. Really low balled one want believe you. Really, do! cold reality America straight given virus. I’d extremely surprised virus kicked curb year now, especially since still don’t vaccine considered safe use.

My best guess? late 2021, tops. make five years hating Donald Trump without ever seeing someone refer Fanta Menace?! thought seen every imaginable permutation insults orange skin, wrong. Don’t forget Red Tide season. Ford study (rightly so) criticized randomized trial. Also people got RCT also got steroids. data large British RCT (RECOVERY), group found Dexamethasone 6mh lower 28 day mortality ventilated oxygen-dependent patient. 

Quote : patients hospitalized COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine associated reductions 28-day mortality associated increased length hospital stay increased risk progressing invasive mechanical ventilation death.

HCQ done for. know doesnt work molecular level. know doesnt work two independent RCTs.

I conservative btw. doesnt count anything, topic science. I'm might visible thoughful meditation abt username. Dumbass work said heard story Facebook gates planning this. Well Bobby, long IPhone? prefer larger umbrella term ""fucking idiots."" yeah didn’t say meat department, said checkout line. big difference. 

i mean yeah everyone expected get worse fall flu cold come back. It’s almost like live interdependent society, Internet Maybe lose license. seems violate every principle physician.  Why? sports want go without crowds spectators, go ahead. stadium filled even 20-30% capacity, think would send wrong message.

There's little wrong sports themselves, baseball especially considering easy keep distance play wear masks dugout. Football, hockey, basketball worrisome someone else's proximity lot. That’s bad idea. Israel opened early quickly, also didnt enough testing tracing, opened lifted restrictions Pm literally told people go fun, Nearly nobody uses masks practice social distancing, Add fact heavily populated(considering small is) , caused cases surge back up. Source live israel. People seem forget good countries like iceland NZ even vietnam ETC lockdown, Obviously going go lockdown particularly exist strategy going fail. got deaths EU mate there's people living Tbf half country vote him. still says alot half thought he'd good. Fuck knows I'm hesitant problem people calling fools out. careful. 😁  first sign moron someone comes grand conclusion anecdotal evidence (happens time reddit). course conveniently ignores deaths labeled COVID deaths actually way likely.

Statistics rarely perfect someone looks one exception throws completely someone understanding use them.

Kids medically fragile make almost every single death age group. epidemiologist CNN day said, ""To defeat pandemic need three things: Compassionate leadership, accurate information, sense solidarity among population (we're together). US zero them."" Sounds right. I’m praying NCAA conferences Texas start taking serious precautions, cancelling seasons, least making big changes schedules.

I would imagine time college pro team cancels makes changes player safety, would put pressure UIL take precautions Absolutely! would ideal, sadly like said there. Take crowned topped stag character antlers, way older animal contributing herd anymore small spiker stag Oh, definitely. That's pharmaceutical companies advertise TV magazines.

But still irresponsible. Hospitals billing CPT codes patients die put primary diagnosis (and cause death) Covid want extra 20% per cares act. yes whether patient lives dies put Covid primary diagnosis (icd10).
 
This 100% completely irrelevant subject hand.
 
It’s also Medicare fraud. see happen, whistleblow claim cash reward.
 
Hospitals **do not** get paid death Covid patient. Claiming dead patient treated Covid, thereby reimbursed treatment, thing paid death Covid patient. like attitude dedication. also clapping. selfish, narrow minded bastards would done problem. Ah yes, seasonal SUMMER viral spikes They're poorest country EU. crowded, substandard/multigenerational housing less public assistance people likely still go work sick.

And lot people work kind settings (think garment factories) shown, time again, perfect vectors spreading virus). mucus cannot removed lungs sufficiently. ARDS causes semi hardened barrier lungs blood vessels. bad thing ventilators ARDS strong pressure vent necessary oxygenate blood also eventually causes severe damage alveoli. Fauci learn didn’t know viruses telling everyone it’s stupid wear mask? much blood hands, lot people listen trump. Almost certainly. Unless they’re manager Dick’s Sporting Goods sick 4 years recovering H1N1, takes body time heal. Also psychological. normal. Seriously. ever get chip got run *NIX. actually surprised see plane sky. well educated man took lessons drama. Mr. Freeze joke. realized recently much less used Yelp recently. 93 would go heaven? know consequences murdering people actions. Doesn’t seem like holy behavior opinion... almost ridiculous displays ""masculinity"" act impress opposite gender. 

That's primitive somewhat efficient tactic fair. Shame pick something else show instead, like pretty much anything else kill people pandemic.  Humans dumb hell get people. mask. Well *someone* replaced incense weed

&amp;#x200B;

/s Also Lee need denial realize this. bad know what? That's okay! Let's work get better. okay admit. Fauci comes clean apologises, it'll forgotten. Instead blaming Americans, blame put incompetent leaders place power... oh wait. ""Once fundraising organized, disease never cured""

- Jerry Lewis  biggest flaw Swedish strategy allows massive amounts people get sick quickly pandemic begins, time doctors clue treat them. locking pushing potential outbreaks much later date, science catches learn things like proning, oxygen feeds instead intubation, remdesivir, steroids, manufactured antibodies greatly improve odds survival. mention big winners like New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam seem beaten completely (China too, much drastic measures). countries lock downs taken seriously paid off. Countries take seriously inadvertently going Swedish route, even fewer deaths per capita treatment improvements. think like jump conclusions reading redditors comment history lol. lot airports owned cities though. Local governments could shut airport. employer (who time amazing, literally voted one best state 5 years running) said go back office allowed work remote sick use PTO. We've remote since March slowly bringing people back. supervisor said today going look way feeling little sick still work. She'd rather get trouble one us infect whole office. freaking thankful her. 

POTUS: Florida ‘a big tough \**self made\** position’ coronavirus

Italics mine. lies. lies. DeSantis never done one thing battle pandemic without dragged it. course thinks schools open. wanted reopen Spring. They're working 97% work one cities. Nobody wears masks they're lobbing lives gdp. would absolutely agree. Even though ask certain questions, trivial lie can't verified (even though explicitly illegal misrepresent owner's/animal's status states--though would require police called cops actually charge liar.)

I also think also small part people adamant masks. allowed bring pets airplanes (and get away bringing stores) minor issues (or flat lie), [speaking documented physically disabled person] think ADA automatically accommodates/exempts anything causes discomfort low-key anxiety; granting permission pets exempting wearing mask. Shitshow 2020 thought Americans /s bots getting predictable Bill Soros! Buttery Males! Ah.. one saying thing 3 weeks ago deaths.. idk. Started rising? doubled daily totals since beginning July. Hold on....since U.S. learn? COVID-19 disease. can't live fridge. SARS-COV2 virus? Absolutely. really hope someone balls tell cops come mask put mask GTFO. Ahh grim reaper arrived shreds, believe. Jesus Christ, dude...so really idea what’s going here? phase 3 trials. released results phase 1/2. Production *not* phase trials (obviously?). producing COST (per comment) right when/if approved immediately ready distribution. big sticking point want Businesses Immune liability Covid related lawsuits. read valve employee handbook... joke, see asked clarify? Obviously not, however lots antibody tests showing 0.2IFR many pushing complete horse shit places anyone find weird choice words video? literally ""calls"" ""supernatural heatwave straight hell.""

Seems like odd thing preacher ask for. depends team/state. states banned fans, allowing fans reduced capacity. county Florida thing. (May county)My county zero protocols place child staff member gets sick, little concerning Fuck that, need liberate sconnies garbage gerrymandered state legislature. states agree send shit citizens dakotas. Wow, don’t know went wrong US seems like percentage country turned complete whack jobs. don’t remember people believing many conspiracy theories years ago, maybe wasn’t paying attention. I’ve heard it’s mostly around here.

Unfortunately, don’t think we’ll real information opening schools go schools US start open even it’s still going depend individual community. talks bit comparing Germany/Denmark basically shouldn’t. 

I think there’s distinct difference mentality Americans basically country.

There’s also population differences.
NYS: 19.45 million
NYC+LI: 16+ million
Germany: 83 million 
Berlin: 3.8 million
Denmark: 5.8 million
Copenhagen: 0.6 million

So leads believe upstate communities could fairly well they’re following guidelines. downstate starts outbreaks get spread.

And transportation? know Rochester uses public buses get students school doubt they’re district like that.

Now, don’t get wrong. Schools important quality online education isn’t available, everyone learn way see pros cons. point schools open think it’s rather important educate feed students would probably limit free time socialization.

I’ve read YMCA Day cares weren’t affected COVID, honestly don’t know true accurate is. mean Syracuse day care hit countless summer camps hit(none know NYS resident camps closed NY).

If could understand normal year ago things changed think we’d better place. Hopefully time get back normal activities educators important quality education education itself.

Good luck stay safe! Covid deaths metric counts. Poverty, hunger, suicides, depression, delayed surgeries, lost opportunities, harms lockdown count well. sense Sweden better every country. importantly, everyone predicted bodies would rolling countries without lockdown. Sweden proved true. That's huge. really potential become NY NYC densest populated city country far. become mini-NYC's multiple mini-NYC's outbreaking across country still bad. Different, still bad.   finally mandating masks state. live Indiana, people responsible wearing mask, everyone needs part. Thank already wearing mask! [Yersinia (the bacteria causes plague) even rare causes thousands cases year - present wild US prairie dog populations. think got lucky. live Ohio. bars open live. boss told said wanted work home also told need educate cases rising. also says things like ""irregardless"". established pre-Covid study shows reduce oxygen despite rush experts saying doesn’t. http://scielo.isciii.es/pdf/neuro/v19n2/3.pdf Hmmm murder response wearing mask. Sorry, cup tea Yeah viruses persistent even human DNA 8 percent 4 viruses men eradicated including smallpox. Others close. impossible eradicate disease. Yeah, death rate doesn’t matter. Thank you. informative stuff That's simply wearing mask. season. Sadly. think CA caps $450. case-by-case. people pass up. diamond tiara! valid reasons. asthma bad can't wear mask really risking COVID going grocery store almost surely die catch it. walmart somebody mask stand outside doors wont even let without mask, need get someone tht lowes. lot less likely result confrontation they're already store Yeah, matched one wrong. scotch clock. Still, embarrassing engineer, though. Indianapolis, mayor mandate prior governor issuing it. time rest state caught up. appendix removed.

&amp;#x200B;

WTF. Home school. That’s we’re coping. work send legislative graveyard... can't anything let it!  everyone could get *on* birthday instead draw. might way go forward yearly vaccine, seasonal like flu there's reason try cram entire country one time appointment--you could year round rolling program.  gets removed every time post Garbage in, garbage case it’s clear - I’m talking Indiana. Michigan sheriff stated know possible code violation could write citation department going write any? 🤷‍♀️ People can't really expect make lot education skills Thats definitely true plans university free, hence, flu shot free. Constituent services??? doubt people city council meeting held open forum district years. mainstream behind this... Worst thing Texas could really avoided never took seriously works worth thousands per joke? ALARMIST? Stuff like frontpage Reddit r/all whatever. enough Redditors seeing stuff. understand difference death rate total number deaths? won’t anymore libraries go lock again, many Americans reduced beggars feed families.

The thing everyone wear masks ride thing virus burns through. Shutting businesses nothing! People operate underground order make ends meet. Hairdressers work homes, restaurants shut cater private gatherings, bars set shop frat houses “Speak Easys” charge cover get by.

This definitely optimal solution many people die, strong make through. mass producing vaccine right now, cost, cut production time. timeline gets sped up, skipping testing. 

Also soonest saying phase 3 complete October. That’s ten months. seems right schedule vaccine developed unprecedented urgency. 

So first production already ""phase 1/2"" it?

So say Please stop spreading blatantly false information?

You even know development phase forgive take information grain salt. It’s SPIKING. 1,000 deaths yesterday today’s numbers aren’t in. sub isn’t really speed. Retail employees going enforce laws. almost like people finding need people job. could call law enforcement something. sounds like something used think mattered. Good thing finding happens law matter. hubcaps look like part umbrella spreads closes canopy? Warehousing logistics costs play mark plus hospitals pay reduced price. product notoriously expensive keep hand transport. Usually looking manufacturing company sells distributors, distributors sell retailers medical facilities. Manufacturing facilities keep costs low national distribution networks. Nobody makes good profits pre carona even costs distribute isnt full delivery trucks usually higher profit product helps pay transportation costs. Sounds little bit job handling it, except labor day part. Exhibit A: Benghazi. Remember outraged people right got that? know many people died attack? 4. *Four fucking people.* *sooo* mad that. 146,000 counting Americans dead COVID, overblown hoax. tend agree, even get good vaccines think spread much it'll continue mutate recur would normally say endorsement would preclude WH trying oust Fauci. But.... Compared GA FL governors angel I'll give went Alabama. several trips planned. live apartments front door right next mine. 3 feet away mine. killed adult population children kill deadly virus.. Gestapo.. raving dictator.. devilish govenors.. child trafficking ring.. record temperatures.. soon devastating hurricanes due climate change.. list goes still unable make logical argument day later. Pathetic. frequency sirens definitely something stuck breakout. death rate high counted home deaths probable COVIDs, system overloaded unable create safe place decompress hospital protect un-infected nursing home residents.

While overall management route drastically affected outcomes (other proning, anecdotal/weak evidence dexamethasone/AC/Remdesivir), chance really cut death rate rest country willing learn NYC alas are.

Ya'll lucky 90 degrees+ outside, can't imagine it'd look like cold spring (March-April) Fall rolls around. Da hell? understand aspect things would rather lose every material possession family Michigan hot nothing like Mississippi hot time year—trust me, ones work hate coming plant summer due humidity. able plan outdoor wedding right amount shade still reasonable comfy. here, might well wedding sunset keep people passing waiting bride start aisle. Oh that's undoubtable. However, point Pfizer never really advertises Viagra. Look packages Advil Chapstick Google images. never put Pfizer logo anything front. Hell, chapstick desk Pfizer name common text style tiny, beside bar code.

In contrast, viagra pill quite explicitly Pfizer written pill. Everytime someone commercial movie takes viagra pill, word ""Pfizer"" runs across viewer's screen. iconic pill's shape blue color It’s observed. People don’t believe happened peer reviewed paper published. Otherwise, people dismiss reports. Spoiler: won’t enforced Fortunately see one person wearing one Kroger day. seem good enforcing now.  Quick Google search led CDC stats 2017. 2.8 million deaths whole year, 7,700 deaths day. According CDC leading causes death heart disease, cancer, accidents order. 647,457 deaths heart disease, 599,108 cancer, 169,936 deaths accidents. 

That averages 1770 deaths heart disease, 1640 deaths cancer, 470 deaths accidents. number deaths saw today thankfully bad got peak, definitely trending back up. 

Don't look info think ""why big deal almost 8k people die things day?"" problem comes hospitals related infrastructure arent built handle kind surge. ICUs example given day two thirds full average IIRC (citation needed) , ICUs filled additional people getting sick makes likely people die directly COVID-19 indirectly cases due lack access proper care. 

And lastly 1100 people dying one specific disease. Cancer heart disease comparable number terms cover large number different conditions. example another quick look Google 2018 lung cancer specifically killed 154000 Americans. COVID-19 killed many shutdowns social distancing measures half year.

And think. takes wear mask thats much people.

TLDR COVID-19 likely one leading causes death today. Lmao guy really tried make point without valid argument, kinda reminds toddlers say ""because said so"" ***GERMAN SCIENCE BEST WORLD!*** Oh many probably realized this. Unfortunately would unpopular among stupid people stupid people appear form majority. Funny enough, conspiracy theory paddled many India. say, Drs get X amount money admit someone call corona. that’s it’s exploding south right now, everybody escaping heat inside air conditioning, virus build up, circulate, survive longest. comedy king ordered couple shnazzy masks 10 tree. I'm finna turn shit fashion statement That's really epidemiology works. still first wave.  comment exist.

It probably removed auto moderator. need walk reddit works? Okay, so...we’re agreement. I’m really sure arguing about??  That's deaths cases. sure misread. lots anti-vaxxers already US, imagine resistance word get pushing people vaccinate Chinese vaccine?

That easy. brand American vaccine. Problem solved. accuse Chinese stealing us, really American vaccine. won’t wearing masks, like people bbq park 30 nearest relatives don’t wear mask “it’s outside, it’s safe” smfh stop them? Sometimes better let things work director CDC claiming schools perfectly safe

Did actually say taken context? 4x (2 doses, spaced 2 weeks apart). right, need issue. 

Really way screw would put complete fuckwits charge vaccine stockpile/distribution... That's exception everyone points measure ultimate success; they're outlier literally country able eradicate things collectively did. (And could always rear ugly head back NZ pretty damn quick jackass shows violates quarantine - nothing time years now).  honest, schools open fastidious masks least form testing. Checking everyone fever every morning example may catch 40% cases, plus masks enough take R0 well 1.0. still requires end after-school activities least sports, etc. lot same-day testing school closure week anyone came positive, testing everyone re-opening, would stop virus effectively. testing US.

You need stop 100% virus, we're eradication stage. Stopping 80% would enough. EXCEPT kids still able catch families take school, would cause regular closures.  take lowest count confirmed deaths highest estimate total infections. Put dot .com looks like .com./ -It lot old people.

-It's swing state steeped political drama.

-Florida publicly release police reports, lot interesting stories. dOnoRs!! I've heard (but sure people got idea) hospitals get money government covid deaths. cant even manage read inbox. small child autism allowed got me. I'm convinced congregating massive crowds effect spreading disease. appreciate accidental case national healthcare system, cynic wonders:

*What happens Pfizer says there's chance vaccine ready Election Day?* held hostage small minority anti mask, trump loving pieces shit. new excuse US better ""many"" countries compared deaths per capita 2020 one wants law order. Look what’s going past 2 months. one cares. It’s free lately. looking skeptic's data. Take grain salt. Growth hottest 13 states declining 2% week. Arizona's outbreak dissipating.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Whitmer already did. Mask mandate going like week two MI  thinking white. Period. them, effect white people. subhuman darkies immigrants. Cuomo, Democrat, responsible thousands unnecessary deaths NYC, probably individual. give free pass.

 Classic.  Help us non Americans here. news... Lmfao hilarious. still least one case literally foresight means? Sounds good, let’s open schools  southern Arizona saying explicitly. One mayors meeting Trump personally thanked building wall ""or else cases would lot worse"". pronounced ""whining"". attacked prez time Human malware still favorite. Think. Goodnight. fun ban Votes bad leaders. 

Blames leaders problems. 

 Murrrrica German say: lack incompetence astonishing. claiming. observing obvious. make account read news article. ""we 15 cases, soon zero."" -Some idiot test less deaths Fuck Rand Paul read thread? study shows immunity still usually quite strong around three months, supporting idea persists much longer people. Inevitable? Every developed country world disagrees. takes three weeks lockdown, absolutely works. Look current death rates countries 1000 deaths day back March April. implemented lockdown measures, public health measures, masks, home working suchlike. worked. Ugh. Fear healthy normal response pandemic. “Y’know what? I’m tired dealing baby. I’ll stop paying attention it. It’ll stop problem then.” Incompetence confined Trump administration. Several blunders NYC elsewhere happened people opposed Trump administration. bugs seeing went Cuomo gets pass blaming Trump.  almost zero evidence outdoor spread. even circumstantial evidence call everything else show quickly spreads tight indoor spaces stale recirculated air. best scientists fight, ones seem actually understand science works cherry pick they'll label ""inconclusive"" know airborne; know spreads mainly indoors except extreme circumstances outdoors. they've known long time length exposure breathing air infected individual within given volume air.

The fact fucking beach photo... YET ANOTHER BEACH PHOTO... accompanies article practically nothing done place countries realized early source worst outbreaks, OFFICES, goddamn hopelessly disingenuous dont know scientists like Linsey Marr throw towel trying get better information scales risk people accurately risk assess navigate daily activities.

We know infections happen home. mentioned here... headlined U.S. news media article yesterday talk mitigate this. 

Ummmm... can't. stop people getting outside home bringing afterwards.

Like airborne office stuff lately, acted reported upon NEW news. problem is, new news CANT STOP VISITING HOME. stop going church, indoor restaurants, mandate offices employees work home made (this simply happening American msm care stories outbreaks happened office people told keep coming - they'd already successfully worked home). 

Of course infections happen home. April, South Korea China put number 60-70%. solution shut places people likely get bringing home - offices, indoor dining, churches, schools, public transportation, networking events top list mentioned months old article above.

JFC, U.S. reopenings even issue simple guidance restaurants bars done U.K, places, telling keep music minimum none causes people need project speak closer one another. Simple, probably somewhat effective practice right? means 5% fewer cases, one guideline piles onto many smaller cumulative wins, right?

So aside obvious - brain dead Americans acting like masks small sacrifices impinging freedoms - uniquely stupid host ways well? media seem miss month month lurching one extreme another ""scientists"" experts shit call inconclusive studies caused small, safe, assumptive actions taken countries? 

And actions worked point almost zero cases. experts take check CNN MSNBC every night (why even bother mentioning Fox, misinformation business model) saying country control terms new cases deaths it'd laughable tragic. plenty cases go new studies contradict almost total lack evidence, say, South Korean call center study, showed zero evidence coronavirus spreads surface contact. want talk circumstantial, every TRUE contact traced outbreak study (in words, done way U.S. seems it), fact point sign spreading via surfaces?

But kids school telling us they'll frequent hand washing breaks put air space kids wall sink is... instead of, ya know, something useful like getting outside air breaks putting fans near open windows flush fresh air. teach outside there's room possible! ( kids school could certainly it.) long go near beach, guess.

The U.S. bad this. ways even seem apparent most. Ways include deal what's right front us refuse see even portion ego driven ""need right/let good enemy perfect"" scientists U.S. responsible certainly U.S. news media, even so.

Right now, America, went news, tv especially, best place work! That's right, Coronavirus hates work much do, outbreaks fully open states experiencing surges happened 1) Family get togethers/BBQ's 2) Beach????? there's air flow disruption, fresh air, heat, sand - basically best conditions contract COVID 19 3) Night clubs (which they'll say cause young people, yada yada yada) meanwhile, look UK guidance tell night clubs even open begin with? bar? Think much better could done restaurant bar owner/employees bail out. bail schools setting ways teach better remotely. 

But no, worst outbreak sources offender news lately, far, darned family get togethers corona keeps showing at, uninvited. COVID wants free hamburger hot dog, mean infect anyone!

That's contact tracing works - someone party, care young old are, likely contracted work restaurant bar - reason never look there. that's literally way every country handling except U.S. maybe Brazil Russia. Yup see parks full people. Baseball, volleyball, sports games park. one seem care. It’s people u blame. Basically, going give away ""secret recipe 23 herbs spices"". anyone make pretty much. I'm sure oversimplifies somewhat, better Pfizer vaccine. Common still feel heat. Also people individual units room recirculated air. progress Like how? Yeah doesn’t add anything conversation. quite frankly it’s flippancy kind place point seen almost nothing done slow time. leadership given leading left us die. late unenforceable mask mandate work. need mask mandate serious punishment least partial shutdown consisting restaurants bars. think restaurants outside bars cant open. bar successful they're packed tight possible cant 🐘 (am correctly?) don’t like wait vaccine plan either vaccine available, don’t get die covid, it’s fault.
(Unless there’s real reason can’t get like you’re immune compromised something) lot corn ridiculous conversation, but, way phrased it, definition, could literally interpreted, either way, without use pronoun.

It nothing comprehension - structurally ambiguous way phrase sentence. Screw stuff. lorazepam scripts touch horrible people. Even get addicted, potential make problems worse, like anxiety, terrifying. even sure stuff prescribed many issues. don’t even understand think money would come from.  got job temp agency, told weekly therapy appointments offered job. agency ran supervisor make sure issue. New Zealand eradicate? ...yet.  Australia fine, eastern states NSW Vic opened soon, choose prioritise reopening economy controlling Virus, needless say backfired. deaths reported case suits narrative Hell no. debunk conspiracy me? I’ve seen Facebook done research seems hospitals bill insurance COVID deaths deaths. see perverse incentive lot evidence rampant. Well, India much would call mask culture. everyone seems adopted masks rather quickly since government began insisting it. want see morgues overflowing bodies piled street  Coming cinema near you, August doesn’t help there’s articles hospitals getting payments co-vid deaths. Republican politicians getting "".05% death rate"" from? obviously closer 2%+.. Nothing pride suppose.

Although do, may effective US population compared country. lots anti-vaxxers already US, imagine resistance word get pushing people vaccinate Chinese vaccine? keep installing updated microchips track every movement? Nice try.

I think disappointed, friend. Hey, wanted chime say 100% correct. getting bunch downvotes people think promoting conspiracy theory, even though **obviously** not. Sorry that. wanted let know right. fact-checking them, correct.

I tried explain thing (I think) still get it. told fuck off. believe think know sarcastic? we're calling conspiracy theorist? honestly know. tried. We'll 9/11 day mid August. Far perspective required. Yes (currently) 1000 deaths day, that's *utterly unprecedented global pandemic response*. Despite effort still made way #3 killing disease Americans matter mere months. quite simply looking backwards. like saying rabies big deal people die it. reason people die zero compromise effort vaccinate possible case. source it?

Because that's something would love show ""colleagues"", I'd rather use comment that. Lol go where? lived Alaska awhile thinking moving Canada. 

It’s. So. Fucking. Hard. Public places worst prepared turn AC. fans even openable windows. Oh aftermath going fun! tons people permanent disabilities Covid, tons people get insane medical bills, debt. Meanwhile billionaires keep adding billions wealth month.

America general system designed benefit rich, that's it. Nobody else matters. Actually poor good fed propaganda rich grateful education keeps getting gutted critical thinking goes down. brilliant actually brainwashed many Americans are. second round funding announced today based formula hospitals 161 COVID-19 admissions January 1 June 10, 2020, one admission per day, experienced disproportionate intensity COVID admissions (exceeding average ratio COVID admissions/bed). Hospitals paid $50,000 per eligible first round funding based formula distributed funds hospitals 100 COVID-19 admissions January 1 April 10, 2020 paid $76,975 per eligible admission. previous high impact payments also taken account determining hospital’s payment second round distribution.

I must missed says deaths.

 copy part paste it? leapfrog vaccine sars already pretty far line testing. entering phase III good. I'm going try wait patiently get hopes up. much longer trust numbers hospitals data going Trump Inc. announced recent R calculations slightly 1 right above.

Otherwise would living U.T.A.

The United Tribes America. really know situation i'm curious. covid, him. people come contact agrees willing too? go public quarantine apart cause? people lives quarantine apart cause? like super intelligent time following orders like good dogs.
Not supermarket seen people letting noses stick mask. really smart one's, putting someone approaching, pulling passed them. speak people working there. 9 10 mask around chin. One time even saw one coughing (at least elbow) scratching face waiting next customer put groceries band.
And people getting tired it. low infections deaths kind problem, hardly anyone one knows someone got infected. go trouble,.no one it. know, logic.
I colleague, smart guy, told started playing soccer 2 weeks ago. plays 7th league, super regional, super unimportant. beerings afterwards. asked whether concerned getting said want go back bit normal life, can't live fear see world, get anywhere anyway. fear solid second wave here, well. Thank 🙏  always, eat donuts kill black people. told cases deaths diverged wouldn’t see second death spike testing gone way pretty much expected. Police done little actually stop gatherings reality, that's Governors put actual punishment following social distancing guidelines. Non-opening windows potentially insulating thus energy efficient. fenced first I'm fucking getting soon can. want stop worrying bullshit. stress killing me. Damn, idea mortality high amount cancer. Makes feel much better choice stay home go medical appointments mask beginning March. numbers bad, literally point testing "" couple thousand millions, thats even 1%. flu kills more""

Like competition..... I'm 100% lockdown bear mentioning South Africa locked early relatively well (outside townships really possible) kept infections forecasts toll taken economy fucking horrifying.
It's 1% making slightly less year, small medium enterprises dying fucking real time bloodbath. I'm Capetonian, tourism hospitality large chunk gdp fucking toast. 
Restaurants typically employ 30 50 people kinds backgrounds closing fistful every day.

Lockdown necessary, question. Herd immunity fine strategy deploying vaccine idiotic concept without one. make mistake believing rich suffer though. Big mistake. numbers get big becomes difficult understand scale. sitting 1000/day head hard fathom 

In mind anyway. think end know people passed due COVID unfortunately goalpost moving company hasn’t arrived yet. advocate mob assault? 

I advocating law enforcement plane escort people refuse follow rules. mob assault.

Why hundred people forced sit infected deadly disease?  thanks! got tested booked little air bnb cabin getaway wanted get tested sure wasn’t spreading anything big city small town. I’d quarantining anyway wanted get tested extra precaution  thought flu way US back started, well? hand washing, sanitizing surfaces really making effort cough sneeze elbow. 

We need act like earlier year it’ll help tremendously. flu doesn’t stop people living day day lives.

This virus put people work, ruined social lives, made us wear masks public whenever go indoors ...... people want shit end. It’s vastly different flu vaccine (in terms demand). won’t hard time getting people take vaccine. 

Man even “it’s flu crowd” - ok fine. Even reality true vaccine fucking flu shot/placebo drug - take go back every day life, without mask. They’ll that. free fuck want. Getting obese increase chance mother dying.  completely disagree. example, tests would across different days make sense get tested multiple times day. Person tested three straight days, person positive three days single case coronavirus. become positive second third day; remained positive. Person B tested three straight days, person negative first day, continued negative second day, continued negative third day. either days could contracted virus didn't.

The impact multiple testing also offset fact negative tests positive test also negated. means people currently positive eventually test negative virus system negative tests count day's totals used calculate positivity rates. removing positive tests rig numbers. experts appointed, plan. thrown trash.  doesn’t work build wall around Thanks posting. thing restricting airflow. harder breath.

I think continued practice may help. suspect body needs time adjust. Also, type mask big impact. hand, protect well get infected valves make difference. I'm starting suspect contagious disease, spread humans  number children die US due road accidents yearly extremely similar number children projected die COVID worst case scenario. actually good analogy, critical public services use despite similar risks benefit grant society.

""I argument understand say something general missing context elaborate it, top ad hominem attack.""

What said 0 substance, right act condescending do. view graph often. cases high May deaths times 4 now. first last time commenting politics reddit u friend :’ Americans exposed bother anything?

It's better useless eaters die, housing markets become reasonable, stupid people filtered Darwin, legacy job holders eliminated, less genetic adversity gene pool, less obesity, better hand washing, better traffic, lower unemployment, higher per capita income, less welfare programs, less global warming unnecessary consumption, civil rights tested, lower energy dependency, better martial law deployment, widespread corruption exposed, NRA 2A weebs exposed gun lobbyist frauds, government proven maliciously incompetent, checks balances confirmed ineffective, rule law due process corruption exposed, Russian cyberwarfare propaganda bot comment farms social media confirmed shilling day, Intel chips confirmed backdoored hardware level, concentration camps China confirmed making products on. 

Was ever even downside enforcing masks? hard decisions elect representatives make us? Everyone always says need less people, need less pollution, need jobs, need less taxes, need cheaper housing, need lower gas prices. think administration applauded delivering trickle Reaganomics barely half measure. kind American wants work living? supposed get bootstraps shoulders go entrepreneur. teenagers streaming stupid games make millions, 30s still set alarm, wagecuck modern slave rebranded. know went ITT tech could actor director, unless creative enough handle things even George Lucas do.

The CDC stats respect flu deaths misleading. read fine print, 20k - 50k whatever includes influenza plus causes pneumonia (RSV, bacterial, etc). go CDC page originally linked, people actually tested influenza, positive die year 5,500.

So rough calculation, legit. 80% population infected influenza year, half vaccinated (antibody studies past shown 5 6 people infected year). means 140 million potential develop symptoms, infected.

5500 deaths / 140,000,000 infected = 0.004% IFR

The IFR flu near 0.1%. many articles doctors saying never patient die flu watch. extremely rare. also would see refrigerated trucks lining corpses 5% - 10% population infected COVID 6 times worse.

Cuomo gone far even threaten take away outdoor dining NYC issues large gatherings outside outdoor places. NY fucking around. Antiviral masks existed before. company HK US patent similar thing. FDA gave category. 

In US, hospitals profit, better expensive masks would used less ""cheapest approved n95""

I agree, days I'll spend little time anywhere else online feel much better. 

It's classic conundrum advancing technology, think. Instead life getting easier, we're able/expected complete more, life actually got stressful. 

Similarly, much information many misleading straight false information created keep us occupied. agree strongly everything said there, dude. 

I'm getting tired ""anybody sees false information stupid"". people can't navigate internet way little whippersnapper like can, used fed false info. want cut slack. Everyone disagrees stupid, they're misinformed. 

I know arguing that, I'm reiterating kinda going along points. anything deaths skewed downwards since Pneumonia counted Covid related death even though one symptoms. Amen offence Americans looking like bunch idiots rest world things like this.

Edit: Grammar Lol moron Yuck. guess looking hard enough it. Syrups good pancakes, I'm sure many us would opt IV offered.  Congratulations coming worst analogy possible. People become obese hurt one that’s choice they’re free make. People refuse wear masks follow social distancing guidelines therefore put others risk they’re woke know doctors scientists get news fucking Facebook feed absolute morons deserve called faces. Also, it’s hilarious bring low IQs can’t even comprehend idea zero deaths day favorable 1,000 deaths day. Gonna say probably Quebec thing. I'm Canadian never heard this. 444 backdated deceased added Tamil Nadu, state India. revised number deaths. silver lining, can't ignore completely bizarre incompetent response Trump administration. truly grateful impressed made much headway getting treatment thing quickly. looks like become like seasonal illness. 

But death toll States said incompetence truly breathtaking sad. Ahahahaha better chance pigs flying masks becoming mandatory nationwide flatten curve. quite obvious now, even lowest point still 20,000 cases per day. That's flattening curve, take NE equation cases rising country even lowest point. addition, two months would much useful actually prepared - put place coherent national testing plan, put place national mandates ensure supply chains materials needed fight virus, used time educate American public severity seriousness virus convince people board necessary steps address this. none that, hindsight mind could done, 2 months essentially wasted.

The thing CDC react gut feeling. epidemiologists pretty much knew spreading community point need test verify start making calls affect entire nation.

People buying N95s needed medical personnel people fitted wear correctly making almost useless personal protection.

Even changed recommendation face masks still personal protection source control requires actual verified data go of, gut feeling. less 5 studies done source control masking entire world, almost personal protection since that's masks for.

How well working us, huh? way SARS, Ebola HIV aren’t fully eradicated. Viruses way life we’ll hopefully develop medicines treat counter viruses best can. People also need start smarter treating like virus careful. Consider following:

China telling truth size outbreak along (within limitation testing capacity big initial Wuhan outbreak), China (and asian countries) uniquely capable dealing pandemic due collective nature society caused western governments first underestimated danger COVID-19, later turn disbelief due inability handle pandemic. therefore accuse China covering numbers refuse learn lessons China deal virus (most obvious universal mask usage) therefore exacerbating outbreaks.

If actually read wrote, might comprehended I’m suggesting open schools everywhere. may areas it’s safe let facts science guide us instead mass hysteria. That's pretty huge goalpost moving, considering originally places however it’s overwhelmingly leftist.

Even revised version, still wrong. 2013, [6,299,451 enrolled California K-12 schools. 2013, students enrolled New York State K-12 schools. That's total 9,010,154 students 2013. Divided US population 2013 (316.1 million), that's ~2.85% population. Even assume every single one students ""very leftist"", still pulling 1/4 figure ass. meant teachers.

Goalpost moving yet again. imply God isn’t real

I'm totally fine anyone religious beliefs choose, students diverse. feasible teach class Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc, makes much sense education atheist agnostic. want send child Catholic school, that's right. multiple genders,

Multiple implies one. believe one gender? I've never seen someone opinion. talk current president.

While true responsible teachers try influence political opinions students, there's nothing teacher's code says can't talk president. fact, talking president necessary social studies current events classes.

Thanks helping find lol point I'd prefer wash hands rather use sanitizer. vigilant touching face opportunity wash hands. know comments probably best one accurately represents America thinks helping world LOL. cute; think government right thing. Bro, happens fucking suburbs Philadelphia. Let’s single mountain people. hope aren’t one states allows elected time around. cry healthcare colleagues. cry patients everything right still contracted virus. unpopular opinion doctor honestly sympathy COVID pts never followed guidelines, never wore masks, never socially distanced. endangering life, colleagues lives, people’s lives, taking ICU beds ones poor luck. die won’t shed tear, though hope recover learn lesson. 

30 nurses hospital month got diagnosed COVID patient initial false negative test. That’s 30 people, that’s 30 families exposed. cry them. 

I also cry I’m side country family. haven’t seen year don’t know I’ll see next. cry father doctor high risk specialty might get covid end ICU there’s way would able visit him. 

I cry politicized become, powerless. know needs done. doctors do. politicians selfish assholes won’t listen science. cry. Honestly point OP lease one government pay advance munitions used.

But yeah still fly place. Literally anyone head arse saw coming Imagine butterfly effect feel like doesn’t know hard work diligence means. Everything genes natural talent, even... medical expertise...? 

I’ve never seen attribute anything hard work. mean, “aptitude” thing, doesn’t mean automatically know better experts. Coronaviruses exist longer humanity. believe would 67.8 America. lot world used commas dots opposite English.

I also think thousand (or K) Mil afraid seriously mistaken danger virus. Whilst accept balances need struck regarding medical conditions, particularly simply wait patiently turn, really underestimating sole impact disease.

Given hospitalisation rate approximately one five recorded cases, one twenty recorded cases requiring intensive care treatment, means nothing done, hospitals simply run capacity extremely short order. already happening USA states. Quite simply, patients able receive treatment, die.

So ten million deaths considerable underestimate heading, even look USA isolation. Globally could easily ten time number.

If hospitals overwhelmed, mortality rate somewhere 0.5% 1%. Calculated USA alone, 1.5M 3M deaths, multiplied globally ballpark 40M deaths.

Research ongoing determine length immunity received, coronaviruses always allow long term immunity. Personally think plenty, particular disease become endemic like many others, currently pandemic zoonotic needs serious consideration.

I state definitely going happen, reasonable outcomes taken seriously, particularly concerning even technically recovered serious side effects take long time recover from, ranging stroke fatigue. people get it, people die, right? easier something spread means people die. Yes percentage avoid deaths point. honestly know daddy trump said that

I'm surprised all, however key word early. lockdowns last long enough, people got antsy things started improve. like said weddings masks like objective fact. cousin actually wedding everyone required wear masks. (Still retarded, didnt go)

You cant make masks mandatory protest, takes one moron. 

This exactly kind shit I'm talking about. guys listen shit fits biases, nothing else.

There's literally data supports assertion protesters adequately masked versus wedding attendees.

You guys literally zero personality responsibility. problemo. might while. hope get point. Yes. lot people going die this. read comment definition risk level, definition risk death. went casual social drinker daily 3-5 drink day drinker last three months. feel like rapidly closing window cut shit go guy drinks much actual alcoholic.

One would hope even higher memory T-cells arent testing large scale provides level immunity. 

Probably not, thought. hope really. DeSantis ☹️ think US modified herd immunity path along; that's plan Fauci's NIAID start - keeping hospitals overburdening goal. eradication. reducing infections. reducing deaths. keeping deaths natural level disease, without deaths capacity healthcare system. model US following Fauci Swedish model, ability government intervention approach capacity line. say US failing true, goal continue goal virus runs course.

It curious see happens globally line, long countries fight back... long timeline end - eradicate need high % people infected. question infect people, fewest deaths, fastest time &lt; US approach, today (at mere start pandemic) premature correct approach . kill mask. What's point? murderer, instead asshole.

Upon reading, really hope self defense issue even then, sucks doesn’t even take account millions parents lost jobs insurance too. Shouting Queensland point even younger people start taking seriously?

In Germany, knew shit hit fan Merkel saw need public broadcast; first 15 years regency.

Not sure U.S. equivalent would - Trump stopping twitter? Thats narrative theyve discussing since start. Remember ""flatten curve"" thing. ""The curve"" almost always going resemble bell curve regards almost topic Give example single country FULL lockdown everyone, including medical staff food suppliers, currently well maybe distraction ghislaine Maxwell putting trump blast crazies know, think conspiracy 1% essentially ""rebuild"" US way want. everyone either, unemployed/evicted, sick dead, ultra rich come back build country way feel be. communities rich, white people able herd whatever left black brown communities camps hidden away. Saying “You’re armchair epidemiologists talking hindsight” far cry saying “You’re qualified epidemiologists, saying right along, *but doesn’t matter say now*.”

Same logic. shows idea crazy fucked up.

Also, even numbers *""okayish""* sicknesses worse, like favorite argument ""more people die flu every year"", get total numbers add up.

Example random numbers: Total numbers like last year 600k dead variety sicknesses 700k. 100k more. That's 100k people lost whim ignorant people. Crazy huh. Texas fucked. amount people hear Houston defending president saying he's greatest time everyone needs go back work nuts right now. probably get sick people Well paid good five-figures taxes last year. think least could give pill costs, what? 10 bucks? flip phones non smartphones targeted military construction well. senior phones.

Death rides pale horse named Covid America leaders politicians poisons. can’t believe meaningless deaths allowed till today. It’s staggering much people blind politics. Fuck all.

GAG ORDER FEAR MONGERING believe overhaul whole thing like Northern Europe. Greenland ftw Politicians businesses looking excuse avoid actually right thing.

Masks work. work everyone wears them.   Social distancing work, people actually keep distance.  social-distance easy thing talk about, one takes seriously.

The article makes mention masks. Apparently, going limit number tickets sold. 

I see -- stands packed tight 25-yard lines, vacant near end zones. one wearing mask. Thanks politicians doomed. Let lesson. line uncrossable them. Hmm, it’s like didn’t happen Italy.... fuck sake. Oh usually aren’t enough doses every young healthy person get flu shot 

Is can't practically create enough doses, enough people want anyway bother making need?

I never problem getting flu shot every year. Maybe super early season, November places walk-ins.

I never understood *not* getting flu shot. people like getting sick? town full idiots fucking duty state men women hospital forced making shit decisions. give shit GOP anymore fact he's concerned speaks volumes gross incompetence pervades Texas leadership.

During stage 1 states allowed 1 customer per 20 Sq Meter stores (some states Rheinland Pfalz allowed 1 customer per 10 sq — state measures, however state measures).

Currently country 100% reopened however social distancing masks still required. daily case load (with exception hot spots meat packing plants) relatively low. Consequently able travel go restaurants generally experience fairly normal life. everyone pulled together. 

Don’t get wrong - anti mask / anti science conspiracy theorists too, however population taken social responsibility curbing spread.

*beep* get that's argument yours, think economy going thousands people day die outside house? even people take seriously realize things fucked, really going go buy consumer goods? Travel within country?

The fastest way boost economy get numbers down. Put fire gotten trees rather burn entire forest. Almost everyone wears mask indoors now. Toronto hovering around 30 cases per day, really bad city 3 million. Right Ottawa Peel hotspots house parties blamed (also Windsor farm workers can't blamed work condition problems) Murica

I agree dont need false misleading information, Florida President given us enough those. (Check Florida's excess deaths year tell CFR actually 1.5%.)

Mexico. Mexico already 50% deaths Brazil 16% confirmed cases Brazil has. 

Which even means they're severely undertesting case count lot higher, they're still great shape. Mexico's daily deaths right almost high US moment (915 deaths Mexico July 21 vs 1039 deaths US July 21, rolling average seems even lower). We're #1!

We're #1! I'd argue type arrogance characterizes Americans made us less able control virus. Soon will. think hurts Republicans honest. Every day goes deaths longer time frame shows ineptitude.

Further, attempting stop customer could easily hit medium-high risk depending long confrontation took place aggressive customer became.

They would literally putting harms way. Moar, need moar ways turn around. many things.

Start fining stores employees best practices allow customers properly wear masks social distance, etc.. 

Force stores businesses periodic public playing statements reminding people follow best practices, explain necessary, etc. (such listing latest death rates).

Maybe short videos people respirators, dying, relatives talking loved ones died. Covid-19 verson faces death. Might make actually visualize / realize terrible Covid-19 be.

Of course fine jail people flaunt best practices. this, need comprehensive regulations - masks social distancing whenever near anybody whether inside outside, etc..

Maybe require people download app enable efficient tracing. Publicize temporary law enforcement cannot access data without public warrant (and make so).

Leaders (the President, Governors, etc. need lead example. giving speeches, need wear masks - communicate wearing too. Anytime best practices shows others following ok. need stop it.

We open more. able achieved. prepared extra beds.

Are really stupid think exactly that? Strong rebuttal According Worldometer, number active cases Finland even increased since July 15th. Fingers crossed temporary Haha cause bad breath going find wearing one.

Yea needs mints stank breath. anyone notice this?

I wonder use Clarithromycin/ Naproxen reduce severity illness patient gets really sick ( ' high viral load) .

  cousin say hospitals get money (???) death certificate says Covid that’s doesn’t believe numbers. :(   #Translation:

Every year, around 90,000 people die Sweden. pandemic, meant average around 1,700 people per week lost lives. progress coronavirus took figure peak 2,500 deaths week early April.

Here look excess mortality corona crisis - Sweden, regions Europe.


Under normal circumstances, death toll follows relatively even annual cycle, people dying winter months summer months due to, among things, slippery accidents flu season.


When look number deaths per week past five years, see usually ranges 1,500 2,000 per week.

2020 started relatively good year terms number deaths - death toll lower end normal recent years.

If look mortality rate 1 January 15 March year, get number -1448, thus many fewer deaths average last five years period.

But week twelve, dramatic increase begins, peak 2,500 dead.

In recent weeks, number weekly deaths decreased starting return normal levels.

No one yet knows pandemic measures taken affect final death toll year 2020 whether excess mortality rate large case. time tell.

**The difference sexes**

If compare death rates sexes, see women initially slightly higher death rates men, men died peak epidemic.

Overall, however, men women follow similar trend epidemic.

**Large regional differences**

Covid-19 affected whole country extent. parts particularly hard hit virus' progress, becomes clear comparing many died per week, region region.

The Stockholm region worst affected. total, 2,200 people died 2020 compared average years 2015 2019. week 15, worst week far pandemic, 781 people died. 2.5 times many average week previous years.

In Västerbotten, contrary, 108 people fewer usual died far year.

Press ""Number"" see actual number died 2020 average years 2015-19 press ""Difference"" see percentage difference 2020 average (displayed 0%) 2015-19.

#Sweden Europe
How Sweden comparison countries?
The European network EuroMOMO collaborates European infection control public health institutes produce comparable picture excess mortality different European countries.

By adjusting seasonal fluctuations trends, looking much number deaths given week differs normal country, EuroMOMO developed ""Z-value"" excess mortality comparable countries.

A Z-value zero corresponds mortality expect normal week country.

Here, too, see Sweden beginning year slightly normal comes excess mortality. peak week 15 z-value 13, lower many European countries' maximum levels.

At time, time period z-values normal longer Sweden many countries.

The Netherlands, example, reached peak z-value 22 week Sweden's peak, normal levels since week 20.

You also look excess mortality looked like different age groups. Sounds like pure gop bullshit talking points. comment removed pure idiocracy. nursing homes took patients back. think would stay hospital forever? point time go hospital. governor made decision. Let’s forget number deaths there’s social distancing, quarantine masks place. hadn’t taken action COVID-19 started spread you’d looking way way way worse numbers.

And put perspective large state patients aren’t freely transferred, Dallas St. Louis 631 miles Dallas El Paso 635 miles.

However, think hospitals healthcare officials doomed start, [having Lord Farquaad ""And kids always wear mask keep distance other"" don’t. It’s fact. mother liar. Deaths up, hospitalizations up, unemployment up. 

So stocks gonna hit time high today! People stupid selfish. favorite bar 4 months.

I feel bad owner, safe. Many schools required doctor note, many last year made vaccinations mandatory. district did. kids completely date, prior school year giving shit kids' latest records last year, even though neither needed booster shot time. Really? Huh. TIL wouldn‘t count too. People pissed enough mild restrictions still place. don’t see another disciplined lockdown. They‘re hardly believing low rates infections lockdown. Complete blind narcissism! whole world get them. I’m gonna completely ignore context you’re saying keep drilling single words /s hope eat shoe soon.

source: Floridian Note goverment: doesnt get easier catch testing cases explode. 

Just saying, become clear United States government currently needs basic common sense things spelled them. 128 days hospital? That’s horrible 

He may awful shape Yeah saw people dining IHOP outdoors, everyone far apart. People seem well mask wearing, one wants virus. death panel ! United States also baselessly accused Chinese ""hacking vaccine data"" yesterday.

So SinoPharm/SinoVac ones get pushed expect Americans scream ""they stole us!!1!1!"" yet bet complain businesses raise prices sand bags hurricane rock salt ice storm hits. hypocritical. say it?  need excuse maintain worldview Trump second coming cannot wrong. Therefore anything reflects poorly hoax. I'm gig driver. go eat, see lot ""Its muh raight to""

Delta: ""you banned life. Bye."" Do... even slightest inkling obnoxious being? That’s literally exactly said. Covid proven otherwise. true.  Hmm ...... that’s exactly someone guilty planning use vaccine implant microchips people would say ............ time brought relative hospital already infected anyway.”*

Not necessarily. use example: live separately elderly parents careful social distancing health conditions make extra vulnerable. caught virus hospital sent one home die, would fall care them, drastically increasing risk partner. I’m sure many others could find position. insane Treating patients dead patients. 7k year rent people Stocks casino feel like people masks “loud people” general don’t like idea something mouths would “silence” mind don’t get decide can’t see friends, meal drink, etc scared. don’t get decide amazon target replace small businesses forced closed. don’t get decide cancel elective procedures literally catch cancer conditions early enough treat. stay home don’t want exposed me. Crazy read sentence exactly one... means real brick mortar. tents set park Currently school accounting. Yeap article may directly related sub, anyone curious countries, payroll taxes fund social security US, senior stipends. Cutting tax would defunded program time seniors especially vulnerable. I'm Finnish, confirm. Everyone thinks corona time over, although cases starting increase slowly. think last week double amount cases week week might almost double amount cases compared previous week. positive rate small since people get tested easily, good thing. Folks.. result anti-science creationism movement last 20 years. I'm little disappointed we're still talking Ted Cruz bullshit. maskless American Airlines flight clearly publicity stunt. give bunch morphine. Good luck finding job illegal immigrant Side note: 1 10 Americans dumb shit. ""Terrorists kill 200 Texas, targeting sick elderly""

Except terrorists officials charge. Good job!  Funny, governor explicitly prevented cities so! Agreed. one submitted project class, fail least get low grade. Yet stuff like degree frequency question, sadly. 

But hopefully start since mistakes really piling up. Commodity luxury, meaning need survive. want food restaurant place world get it. Necessity relates ability acquire food store cook yourself, thus ensuring survival needs met. *BEST* infected. *NUMBER ONE* whole world! *MOST* deaths! presidents even come *CLOSE!* Looks good. Hopefully results replicated larger studies give us effective drug keeping people ICUs dexamethasone already proven significantly cut mortality people ventilators. least partially effective vaccine xmas we're lucky Oxford hopefully treatments pop we'd much better prepared another wave comes. thought hurricane season over! would want experimental vaccine likely think ""common flu"". likely concerned, careful taking steps avoid getting sick.

However, surrounded people wearing masks, social distancing rising cases make hard even careful people avoid exposure. 

This allows data vaccine performs exposure without ethical implications exposing healthy people potentially deadly virus. Leading cause death heart disease 1,700/day. nearing too. One year old account 4 comments. Seems legit. Every 3 days dead 9/11. imagining riots happen if/when cops killed breonna taylor get vaccine vast majority rest population. vaccine distribution next big catalyst civil unrest. We're #1. We're #1.

MAGA!

What miss? squandered denying problem.

They decided attacked people ""real americans"" guess New Yorkers count something? Delusional, bigoted. hospitals gain money covid cases, yes happens. really inflate numbers much? doubt it. There's solution problem, nested bigger problem hospital beds. (Except acquiring wearing N95) society buy grants rights point someone else's begin. infectious disease could kill someone seems fall side infringing others rights. like know more, provide link constitution. could forseen... HIV condoms, flu vaccine. preventable diseases. feel them, imagine America doesn't. really nothing point trying make. Yeah thats Tennessee. Back start around March, one wearing mask felt self-conscious, debating car whether wear mask/not wear mask going grocery store. Wore mask, go inside, one mask everyone looks like im freak. 1 week later March, go back, decide wear mask last time, go inside, everyone mask everyone looks like im freak. Since pretty much fully adopted town. Everyone wears mask, mandate passed 2 weeks ago enforcing handful inconsiderate people refused wear mask. Sometimes force right thing people. They'll cry rights sure, screw em. one right hurt people. Taiwan enough tests, don’t. surprise. /s much winning. Karens &amp; Chads would STFU &amp; wear damn mask!!!  Oof, that’s rough. don’t remember much except mom driving doctors office happened drive school happy wasn’t there. Someone work posted meme saying ""I'm wearing mask I'm forced too."" I'm like realize one would forced they'd own. Sorry say, North marginally better. Granted Minnesota worst day cases even competed South summer, still. may states putting lower numbers, deaths all. state borders stay open. takes one super spreader can't trace, another epicenter begins. absolute nightmare. It’s summer vacation past two months. that, kids friends combination half-assed, cobbled-together “homeschooling” free time/screen time. It’s fine, emergency situation (and still is) it’s sustainable education.  way deaths get counted US countries right? Meaning death gets added someone dies Covid. missing something? hate shit. Like really think falsely inflating numbers helps people? don’t get goal thinking conspiracy after.

They think conspiracy ""to control people"" ... somehow make money it? guess? lunacy behind denial climate change which, idiot minds, also somehow controlling people climate scientists making huge amounts money it, everyone knows scientists money (?!?!?!!!). controlling people.

I really can't even. boss asked us old were, said real 40 would better go try catch build immunity.. official meeting unofficial tone. I've never facepalmed real life moment work nutrition plant dedicated diagnosis virus treatment. completely understand point irrelevant talking something effects individual. realize enormous amounts ink spilled trying answer question God prevent suffering, why/if necessary someone position pray survival seem change outcome events, ever satisfactory answer? incentive test even asymptomatic patients

or maybe they're testing people know potential COVID spreaders building full vulnerable people  Shockingly, people tend ""but MUH FREEDUMBS"" anti-BLM people time. would figured that.   right live south. However I'm talking masks what's going now. I'm talking people believe fair justice system proper treatment jailed it. I'm talking education, healthcare, hell even infrastructure huge left vs right issue state. 'How fucking dare city yuppie liberals ask tax dollars build rail bus network middle Tennessee centered around cities!' Fuck awful I've heard all. Recalling social outrage 90's US Dr. Kevorkian would said looked up, handful states ""death dignity laws"" now. Texas Florida definitely among though. Good.

Like exiting ac'd car never issue. 

They kinda encourage clean glasses often anti fog doesnt last forever. That's case all. Covid patients, whether hospitalized covid something else, expensive take care of. Hospitals use protective equipment, spend time effort cleaning diagnostic equipment used patients, generally use resources. patient covid positive comes broken leg, still makes sense labeled covid still makes sense hospital reimbursed extra expenses. ?  ask everyday. It’s getting worse government continues twiddle thumbs. federal government anything? Trump realize dead people can’t spend money? he’s killing supporters? 

It’s hard believe Desantis went Ivy leagues.... really let anyone rich enough huh. requires paying people stay home unrepublican idea is. Republican leadership pandemic trouble everyone.  boss time. waiting come say told so.  thinking it. tips friend? SD meth Covid, guys it. 

Sadly matter bad ND handling it, look South grateful local politicians. Canada. “boomers” actually also paid pay social safety nets help aren’t living “comfortably” (like employment insurance economic support systems allow governments things like pay CERB benefits issued pandemic - $2,000/month lost work/had reduced work due pandemic period time) well healthcare EVERYONE matter age, economic background, race, ethnicity, etc generally speaking, one rails either. wish priority system hospital. care covid get less treatment people taking seriously. (If space limited hospital) got Scarlett fever well around age, grandparents basically covered rubbing alcohol wrapped blanket. Shit sucked, times different lol Yeah, point really phenomenon beyond reason. Swedish critics call going form ""state worship"" wherein Tegnell et al become focus irrational, quasi-religious sentiment wrong. Seems apt me. Typical republican following advice business owners science. surprised DeWine trash. Leviticus 13:45-46

Personal ignorance trumps word God, right? ""The economy thanks sacrifice"" - Dan Patrick Yes, let's get ""tyranny"" inconvenient facts. like reality, shall label tyranny spin fiction finally satisfied it. Pretty much thinking too. Even without fans, many thousands would attend events competing countries?  New York react quickly enough. fantastic NYC eventually get board impose strict lockdowns, people started dying NY. first reported death Washington state weeks Cuomo citizens took seriously. preventable deaths, preventable deaths avoided. Oh sure. wish we’d stick basic common rules masking totalitarian rule

outside mask required (but one handy good)

Outside &lt;6ft: mask

Inside matter distance people: mask Joe Rogan said ... billionaires moving families New Zealand, would never.

[‘We Needed Go’: Rich Americans Activate Pandemic Escape Plans - Interest New Zealand bunkers surged.](  bought one week ago, plus thermometer. look bad compered republicans saw. holds points, anwsers questions, talk her. Remind CNN ist anticrist Thrump. numbers bad may get worse. rural village unanimous. Sent kids back schools. 

It's going village dead dying soon.  Pandemic 101: deaths lag cases. understand that, plain shut up. agree you, I’m sure post even starts go society whole don’t think points disagree either.

There’s share blame sides. would argue police crackdowns haven’t exactly gone swimmingly recently. ""Jesus Christ fun"" Yeah can’t forget virus starts become inconvenient you. That's pretty tough question answer without room see scale plan is. 

So I'll give bit what's mind, area job sits squarely in, speculating completely ass.

My estimate 2-3 years enough production world, 7 billion people.

The reason landed number, based multiple vaccines available, little complicated get detail, I'll keep things fairly basic. Firstly, Astra zeneca (Oxford) said secured manufacturing capacity 2 billions doses. candidate likely need 2 doses per person. Therefore, current capacities identified need 7 full years production. Now, they'd able build facilities cut time successful ones, source capacity manufacturing sites, would probably take 12-18 months get another site qualified. get lower end, possibly even 9 months facility upgrades needed, governments reducing financial risks cash infusions.

If 3 vaccines work, I'd imagine they're similar boats... 2 billion doses year, times 3... person needs two... puts around 2-3 years enough produced.

These educated guesses based what's shared far. Things done get down. US gets 100% dosing versus Somalia brings ethics argument play. Should/would richer countries get first? Bin Laden would laugh still alive. ""public"" public health. 

People's actions broader impacts even inner circle. I've got problems personal responsibility individualism, society actions inherently affect others. retrospect, it’s clear DeSantis — well governors Texas, Arizona, California lot states — reopened early swayed low death rates eager get economies back track. didn’t anticipate opening bars, particular, would spread virus. weren’t willing get tough people refused wear masks. Perhaps important, didn’t pay enough attention reproduction rate — is, estimate number people Covid-positive person would infect. (In Florida, according one model, I. 

Better getting reality check late never guess. lost popular vote nearly 3 million people. Whine somewhere else. Never claimed Trump consistent, agree 100%. pointing Fauci consistent well. mess. negative results came less 24 hrs CA probably due healthcare support person. brings expected fatality rate. Covid-19 pandemic first started, person 65 expected fatality rate around 15%. enough asymptomatic people tested, fatality rate starts going down, especially count test person *and never ask person tested once.* people nursing homes getting tested 3 times per day.

Of people know tested, forms filled test assign randomized number testing facility asked tested before. 

I think number deaths matters own, number cases number tested used justify opening things back up. ""Not high enough fatality rate justify current actions."" already said. me, view numbers like numbers unemployment: untrustworthy. people saying cold say kills infected.  right, ""at point"" basically can't put cat back bag. Back March could control long term dealt efficiently.

I want idea totally inevitable beginning go unchallenged. Really? people sub seem think entire country suffer uproot lives indefinitely save lives elderly sick. think quite would problem excepting staying locked socially distance 5+ years beloved health “experts” told necessary. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* That's thing. US economic impact deaths.  Whoa. Thank reasonable answer. I’m
in NYC teachers know (who know least one teacher died virus) would love go back but, like you, feel rush open without really thinking shortsighted. Also, difference upstate NYC wide. Solutions need tailored. Information useless. heart attack patient dying covid antibody counted covid death. Shit inaccurately reported numbers polls useless. You’re thinking Kix.  Something closer cure 20 years ago? Something kills hundreds thousands annually? No, man made virus China takes top. Lmao Came say I’m sure papa elon working it. mean unless ur originator ur first wave must come borders LOL Borderline? Dude... never said flu deadlier general. course Covid kills people, elderly. age group 0-18 IFR Covid way lower IFR flu. clarify, Facebook friend. met conference January probably see annually many years want friends/friendly really want see everyday life. unfollow ignore forever sees person like ghosted online. hate Facebook. day tested adjusted 2 weeks fact,

I'm expert, I'm quite sure day test result reported to...whoever collects results...is day test classified under. We're retroactively amending daily covid test results. seen headline said something along lines ""after amended testing last week's covid cases actually x number higher thought"" coworker literally tried start argument Fauci isn’t qualified position he’s practicing doctor. asked he’d listen Fauci, said personal doctor. really didn’t want argue asked could give contact info general practitioner decades research Immunology creating tangible improvements disease treatment prevention, also presidential medal freedom I’d also like person primary care doctor too. didn’t speak rest day... sure can, lol. know, students eating lunch classroom. desk come plexiglass panel disinfect eating lunch. think decent solution. ""But death rates again"" - someone tells research. I'm playing devil's advocate here, kind ironic. Egyptian common people? lived basic life like Israelites. lost first born too. Exactly, Trump know know jack shit! Terrifyingly he's guy pulling levers America worst Pandemic 100 years. include befits retirement pay cut working teacher. 

Even without 20% fee salary company takes. Well, didn’t. people still able go exercise, business, visiting friends, non-essential shopping, etc. it’s true lockdown half-assing it. Congratulations, successfully outed pedant ignores information focuses minutiae spelling instead actual topic started with.  least silver lining. know groups vulnerable (elderly) keeping virus away retirement homes assisted living facilities top priority reduce deaths. also better perfect understanding treat people virus. least people wearing masks. still going pretty rough August southern states. Applebee’s struggling started, I’m sure surviving guarantee either. Yes, make money, also higher expenses, burn rate likely similar small shop.

The one advantage already set curbside started, going curbside drinks? would think face shield would actually effective, harder get hands on. face shield physically block droplets exhale well would exhaled towards you, mask slow enough reduce travel distance exhaled. might wrong researched anything, makes sense would better. condolences. wish customers anti-maskers would think real human toll happening Nah like comments like this, adds bit humour. Here's recent study published happened Israel opened schools. rural area, schools.

 could fooled me, AT&amp;T towers go meltdown every afternoon time. two new towers can't arrive soon enough. anything, people may defected less costly providers. guess average age appears younger there's testing going on. Early on, people really know had. Since younger people generally less severe symptoms, assumed bad flu show hospital get tested. testing awareness, younger people show numbers.

For sure, Oxford study looks promising! there's others. know hope multiple vaccines speed vaccinations would fantastic. Anti-vaxxers think polio measles real, hope COVID. Lol.

Stay safe great weekend Biden’s presidency starts January 20th Lack personnel, I’m sure, probably PPE. liability hotel. point cautious regarding protests. allowed people gone them. Also big events allowed people go them. people failing cautious fate Americans blaming one another. problem left right, left right. People never left home town, also never outsiders visit, find really hard understand big world lots people it. USA Iceberg- Stand aside. We're YUGE!

Iceberg USA - shall see happens unstoppable force meets immovable object. Kid social distancing ? Yeah sounds good. Yet, still go comments. really want ignore anything's different yes. stark reminder forced upon there's something going on. make right, get that's pretty strong psychological blow going cause blowback. Everybody gets Canadians wrong. polite...we sarcastic passive aggressive hell. looks polite. much testing!!! could happen?? Yes ofc gets really effective people wear marketing pro-life, less. start making choice buying car, buying mechanical super suit doubles hazmat protection? I’m ready become master chief Exactly Except means deaths also went unreported. Thank putting bullshit firm. people weird babies masks DONT know Aggressive trivial yet crucial request. There's gonna lot dead come too. Remember like halfway first wave normalize number franchises like 10x rate (there ~50 Chick-Fil-As 181 McDonalds Colorado). Small numbers, chance could playing role, worth reporting looking makes sense, basing decisions % positive, one person tests positive 100% correct? person tests negative 9 times 10%. completely destroys 3 day 7 day averages may give clear picture what's going on. Especially required 3 negative tests ""cleared"".

 person still negative, counting multiple times, counting multiple positives person. 

They need seperate overall tests new tests two separate metrics imo. Completely yes.

Warned mask use fears PPE supplies health workers. received data, updated guidance never veered it.

Unlike Trump example, anti mask political reasons, done 180 without underlying facts changing. That's one biggest unsolved problems Palm Beach County (just north Broward County article). school board worked improve device internet access students answer childcare problem. sent email said ""reaching out"" business leaders ask offer greater work-from-home workhour flexibility, government officials provide childcare support. even suggested families stay-at-home parent invite kids homes schooling.

There's big split opinion families older kids stay-at-home work-from-home parent families young children, inflexible jobs, adult supervision options kids.  Huh, wow always thought less efficient. yeah, time saved immense. made for...eating, drinking.

So won’t used bars restaurants, two biggest spreaders. Like get can’t eat drink without moving mask, promise means people going use excuse wear mask entire time they’re bar restaurant. outdoor dining drinking allowed.

Bigger question whether police actually enforce new mask mandate all. Ok think concerted effort tank economy destroy people’s lives businesses *just* make sure Trump loses election.  

But cabal decided sleep 2016 let get elected first place? 


And even media reporting narrative corona anti-mask pushing states open early possible? media isn’t forcing words mouth. Even it’s 50% overblown that’s still massively infectious disease killed ton people. Trump taking every precaution get economy rolling ASAP. got tested 2 months back never got reply. one household got sick likely summer cold got day 2, never got results. 2 63 power first day 1 2 0th power? Jordan Slam Dunk. 1. Isolating vulnerable people work. disease massively contagious possible put people bubble.
2. things people less risk help keep vulnerable people getting sick minimally inconvenient; must see people outside maintain distance, wear mask protect others indoors.
3. 150,000 Americans already dead, seem care.
4. fact find minimal inconvenience heavy lift protect lives countrymen means fact ignorant, selfish asshole. mean complete lack evidence long term immunity? Right (based every known coronavirus) have. don’t know one way point. I’d argue fantastical assumption long term immunity.   NY told wear masks social distance, etc

And massive underground transport system used significant portion population. free country, right take sorry ass protest. Get fuck here. see Facebook comments local news page story. disgusting long term problems COVID looking pretty horrible though. Trump said: ""We willing work anybody that's going get us good results."" Nowhere talking China. Again, pure deep bullshit CCP propaganda. failed execute critical element strategy. mean bad strategy? Maybe, necessarily. We're discussing Europe, ofc one's going US rn. 

And article Spain: ban cruise ships coming port extended end date Spanish government said restriction avoid risk posed national population.

So quite different Swedish situation ships welcome opting arrive. least they're kid tested, parent approved. always puzzled me, people genuinely thought it'd vanish. POTUS saying it'd done Easter Weekend! Like COVID going go ""ok, guess fun, I'll way"".  Arrival? fucking almost called jury duty, can’t believe forcing shit storm. Pisses redhats want open PR semantics risk lives them. Yes, I'm I'm well aware many cities that's Federal building going find. However half DC federal buildings half population works them.

In addition entire country depends less lot agencies work everyday. agencies like FAA DOT Can't shut without becoming immediate disaster. like FDA CDC particularly relevant right now. 

the US federal government ridiculous wealth facilities resources. ruined post-apocalyptic fiction simply can't imagine scenario bad least part federal government still functioning. Hey hey control rigjt would absolute disaster. Deaths would surge open schools without safety measures. would need split classes half, reduce lessons absolute minimum, make masks mandatory guarantee everyone keeps distance. circumstances would possible give kids education deserve, country handled pandemic far, don’t think would able make happen. Reminds apocryphal story US aircraft carrier receiving request radio change course avoid collision carrier captain refuses several radio exchanges eventually goes ""this warship US navy, *demand* *you* change course avoid colliding us!!"", radio operator end says ""This lighthouse. call"". link source? Someone I've known long time posting FB really know better. original question ""Any pandemic friends scary outlooks thing care explain death rate decreasing chronically unhealthy country yet number cases started rising approximately June 19th. Deaths started rising approximately July 7th. 18 day gap. Average time takes someone die diagnosis kill 18.5 days. hypothetically, we're beginning would rise fatalities resulting recent upsurge answer original question, rate decreasing there's lag numbers. increase predictable right time.

Annnnnd crickets. I’m assuming position without tourists there’s enough $ eat?? Yea, repeatedly bringing hookers inside bubble, need quick results. Yeah, huge spikes previous week 11th 12th like 30-40k higher. florida strategy Yeah, deaths though?

Of course expect see cases testing people. He’s even germophobe, there’s one thing could’ve semi-qualified for, would’ve trying stop pandemic. Instead though, it’s still him. Daily tests staff, complaints testing everyone else rush re-open put everyone else risk. Yup. It’s pathetic stopping unfortunately. Makes understand robespierre gave many people shortening. Can’t imagine even less educated people back considering deal now.  Florian Krammer, PI group behind study, best work Covid antibody testing world right now. It’s well worth following twitter stay date learn interesting things immunology process. legit someone try convince positive test results, babies contact someone tested positive hospitals counted positive tests.

Chick-fil-a well known years [preferred fast food evangelical surprise locus infection.  to, shady stuff back obama president. Basically, type cells line organs. we're concerned with, terms COVID, epithelial cells line lungs arteries. [The article referenced thread, COVID attacks sorts organs: read through, wherever mentions ""linings"" organs, epithelial tissue. know cases tests handled Texas. know whether tests day others backed up. know DEFINITELY practice California lags test results ""baked into"" case dates, instead appropriately back-dating results actually let data show ""how many people tested X date positive"" actually see trends. Anything else smears signal across lag period that's even worse understanding fuck going on. Sorry guy

But globes common all?

Maps horrendous getting true picture world, move equator distorted gets.

Genuinely surprised seeing two World Wars ton action Europe, especially Germany! brother going back school fall matter what. 
I’m absolutely terrified. shit sherlock  nurse little critical care experience find legit ways help Texas without taking travel assignment? **dun dun DUNN** agree. Dumb people argue bring level defeat experience. Hence, education important investment society wants prosper long run. gets better. people watch Fox News, largest news network, ALSO complain main stream media liberal fake news. mAskS BItcHeS disgusting, inhumane thing say. someone may less awesome health, deserve die? really think absolutely nothing else contribute others society general? people innocent people going work life death situation.

So gives right infringe peoples rights purposefully infect deadly need policies place help people need quarantine, safely, ensure needs met so.

Yes need done, excuse unfathomably selfish behavior endangering peoples lives person gain.

No one seems understand thought exercise. real fucking world dead means dead, unemployed means still get go living opportunities fix things.

No idea anyone excuse people purposefully getting others sick. Disgustung evil least. easy. base people demonstrate front state capitols ""free"" country. oppose common sense policy matter principle. might able get away right thing there. question. if, instead half assing next years however long take, HARD shut down? 2 weeks every period time.

Interesting, saying would appear infected twice see much opportunity happened--in line article? 

How doing? I'm sorry going long. American logic actually 5 George Soros something. Shocked face :0 realize said Florida 🤷 mention stole (hacked) from?  Much better last Thursday nearly 14k cases. I'm eyehole man! Gimme them... eyholes! *my* eyeholes! Delicious eyeholes! try NY city send people covid nursing homes ,how many innocent old people got killed call? coworker told father NY nursing home covid patients send almost 20 elderly people got died!

How positive model anything? sounds stressful, I'm sorry. hate make calculations - oh say something might retaliate. It’s almost media knows fear violence sell news stories specifically cover events cause fear viewers. 

It’s better everyone afraid realize they’re swindled actual support help government huge corporate donors ultra wealthy Well, recorded new cases 75,000 day, actual probably 400,000 more. I'd imagine 400,000 day comes fast food restaurants.  Even say 3/4 new cases come family members, means 100,000 getting outside house. Rest world...... rofl. countries second wave? Current predictions second wave looking worse first wave were. time around, people aren’t going stay inside like last time. disagree talking obesity component somehow undermines loss.

We still gathering data information virus. preventable reversible medical issue major risk factor great interest scientific communities public. important acknowledge facts are. Even unpleasant challenge one's previously held beliefs interpretations.

I loved respected grandfather much, believe acknowledging died smoking tarnishes legacy all. anything, inspired loved either quit never start.

In fact, stories like necessary sway publics belief opinions smoking generally. Canadian podcast called Wait, There's More. episode called ""How deal anti-maskers"" came past Tuesday (July 21) ""Unsick"" people getting tested variety reasons. employers weekly tests personnel, (like myself) exposed known positives, got tested precaution, etc. guy internet - credible. school hasent even started yet, I'm certain cases like common got 18 teams first second devision REAL football. That's 36 fields. Minimum. I'm French, care pants? :)  Agreed Oh yeah totally trumps fault. nothing us Americans insisting partying, wearing masks, protesting mass, generally unhealthy/irresponsible pandemic. I’m defending trump people need fact privileged fault... Don’t worry, Texas snag title. Along “Totally OK Ants Dying Patients.” point desperate trolling get raise folks play victim. dead wounded tally continues rise. But, opposite message yesterday sub? 
 --- Wait 5 Minutes Changes Gang already proven 90% stocks owned 10% people Facebook science prevails! walk thru ""taking risk"" ""murder""?

Murder intentionally killing someone ""malice aforethought"". BEST might characterized involuntary manslaughter, even IMO justified circumstances.  JPow magical money printer go BRRRRRRRRR Back March, right lockdown here, talking brother (a Trumper, albeit reluctantly point) asked thought would go Trump's chances fall. shocked (since Trumper) said probably going GUARANTEE election.

All completely support experts say - public health crisis nonpolitical issue - dust ole ""personal responsibility"" Republican rhetoric that's really compelling Americans, regardless political alignment. easy lock. People fence would flocked - Americans LOVE ""successful, tough talking guy"" crisis, loves looking like guy, could go that??

But, course, he's sulky subversive plan his. like HARD is, complicated drawn is, easier problems, wants focus problems claim victory signing piece paper getting loud applause. FAIR! we're fucked “lack evidence” answers automatically going assumed “Yes” me. I’d rather overreact react pandemic/epidemic sick sad tbh. 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic downplayed government well first, we're literally repeating history I'm defending statements, first thing ever taught research &amp; methods class *definitions important*. 

You *must* absolutely operationally define terms planning study. So, Drs, asymptomatic presymptomatic completely different. general layperson, pretty much same, though, due lack knowledge. 

Their failure inability effectively communicate scientific concepts lay-person, third week research methods. Also, failing understand media would run twist everything said.

Edits: English posted before. Stores post clear signs say masks required welcome one. Someone comes without mask, call police say someone criminally trespassing private business. cops ones dealing people instead 17 year old hired pay $12 hour.

So cops come in, explain person needs mask danger community. person tries attack, threaten, flash gun, spit, whatever tantrum, well police deal itll taken care of.  god damn.... least put ppl misery sedatives!!! let dog suffer like this. INHUMANE! wise realize hurry,

Huh? hurry epidemic control winding like keep claiming?

He makes sound like panic mode time job properly. ever get 98-99. seriously hold breath get 94. partner always hits 99. oxymeter measure 98-99 anyone? German here. inform may state suffered amount infections since April today!

I've using worldometers, matching perfectly local county case rate, state's case rate news stimulus package? Supposed decided today doesn’t? Lol so? truly concerned every life.. means great deal people fortunate enough get hospital bed..  agree. don’t think it’s worth wasting time people choose informed. plateau, enough people machines reagents run many tests needed.

Mandatory vaccination children attending public schools, lot countries that. doubt many schools funding infrastructure deal double sized kindergarten class (and double sized class moving every year that) kids held back. still need mask go public places even assuming vaccine 100% effective doesn’t need boosters

Saying one state ""Connecticut"" lockdown mask mandate cases went down.

Ignoring Southern states spiked without mask mandate.

Also, somebody said something masks like help , help also intrastate like California Arizona. they're saying california's cases going Arizona's mask mandate. can't apply line reasoning Connecticut low cases, Northeast HAMMERED COVID, plus mask mandates Northeast elsewhere.

It almost states like Texas Florida getting exact type government response voted for, almost makes wish people decided government run corporations cares nothing ordinary working folks sent packing... requirements face mask? neck gaiter/snood job?

I live NYC wear simple cotton bandana/gaiter almost every situation switch surgical mask I'm indoors prolonged period time.

If going exposed crowds people indoor spaces, get actual N95 mask respirator, however. That's unfortunate. 
 currently pregnant teacher debating whether would worth even bring virus home infant schools return person later year without vaccine.

Americans see driving around valid reasons. could come border closed. could working Canada, could Canadian citizens dual citizens lol Wrong. countries lower death rate USA.

So ignore UK, USA 2nd worst death rate world. Texas governor's fault, alone. always get pissy friends feeding animals lol. love talking point. realize guy came day said NY right.

Second moral story places, important elections ones local.

This school related, Virginia's state legislature finally flipped Democrats, got rid touch screen voting entirely. voting verified voter paper access trail. people running small house Senate state level seats enabled change.

My county elects board supervisors school board well, going back in-person school. make in-person schooling available limited basis, beef distance learning alternatives access issues childcare issues.

Local elections really matter. That’s great news! Good thing stopped giving information CDC. Everyone vaccinated. asking determine would get first dibs it, mathematically determined based individuals risk. Work healthcare, high risk. Underlying health conditions? High risk. Elderly? High risk. Stuff like know. Professionals much better job determining exact priorities. aged well. 😳 teachers know terrified going back school. Sorry, meant away offenses. make price fee $2000 people think twice going mask. 

I know it’s harsh, need point. Things aren’t getting better people getting careless. explanation useful ignore population size talking death counts. please try again. Ah, media plan working. Henry McMaster SC dark horse sure you’re denial stupid. numbers don’t add Texas reporting deaths. 

Texas needs refrigeration trucks... I'll try paint argument best can, hope take seriously wave off.

That's people online capable of, I'm happy engage good faith. point can't lockdown forever.

But one saying what's required. United States lock all. simply haven't. implemented stricter lockdown, mask requirements, heavily pushed physical distancing protocols beginning March, curve would look like UK's right now, Canada's. still actually lockdown -- apocalyptic stuff referencing (unemployment, etc.) happening *in states locked down*. 

New York much better Texas Florida, respect virus numbers *and* employment situation -- yet (so far) hardest hit virus harshest closely followed lockdown. *clearly* lockdown solely responsible. 

The virus (and fear, death, loss health, etc. come it) causing majority economic pain. Healthy people emerge lockdown 2 months get economy going quickly. Sick and/or fearful people uncertain leadership (or none) cannot virus literally still ravaging communities. say that's heartless,

I issue cost-benefit analysis. I'm making arguments emotion here. I'm saying 1200 deaths day (and rising) highly contagious (and rapidly spreading) virus acceptable. figures, realize conducting 800,000 tests day

Yes, I'm aware. [Numbers still triple would expected places increase Anyway, read far, thank you. hope find common ground somewhere.

I appreciate frankness honesty response, little internet anywhere. Common ground found post agree, early childhood development education incredibly important cannot moved online. know US going that, considering absolutely dismal state virus situation, re-opening schools in-person attendance zero planning, leadership, safeguarding (i.e., Trump's proposed approach) going end well. 

I hope someone somewhere federal government spine, person still exists, able develop plan actually carried see 5-12 age group's development (AKA nation's future) severely stunted this. Oh. That’s low blow. transferred. could be. small amount. really live long surfaces. *seems* like transfer surface contamination minimal.

Basically, breath other's faces. car, they're building, there's small air gap you.

That's seems like anyway. Amen Breathe fresh covid air friend. /s Hard times create strong men. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create hard times Yeah. I’m pretty sure it’s 14 day quarantine 2 negative tests player return. long haven’t tested positive play, even contact someone has. Hmm aware distinction. people supposed leading dying still playing party politics. need reframe many patients per ICU nurse opposed normal times. That's true measure crisis.  mean left federal property actually went around unmarked vans, identifying themselves, grabbing people, reading rights charging, holding them. 
Also, Facebook horrible follow Heather Cox Richardson. American political historian professor gives great summaries day happenings. Look Italy. shut completely still high death count. buy 40% blindly believe ever government tells them. neighbor North, watching guys handling whole crisis honestly terrifying.

My City literally 45 minutes US border currently 0 known cases, like y'all could come sorted that'd stupendous RATE changes. larger fraction population immune, slower infection increases even increase.

Let redo numbers. Let's say 100% susceptible population average infect two people infectious. 25% population immune, average infect 1.5. four 'generations' infection, number infected goes like this:

100% susceptible:1, 2, 4, 8, 16

75% susceptible:1, 1.5, 2.25, 3.38, 5.06

One third spread four generations, 25% population immune.

The difference spread (R0\*susceptible fraction)\^generations, high R0 blunts effect get high immunity numbers multiple generations enhances effect.

Even hit point infection tends die rather spread, rate spread decreases get crazy spikes. That's part new pathogens one immunity explosive dangerous. Aside Sweden, implemented many measures. Also whole lying masks thing Fuckin' Fauci did, too. Asshole. everyone Texas chose Texas, chose it, living US. Enjoy. I’ve noticed something similar, although it’s important paint broad strokes. diagnosed around age 12, biopsy whole nine yards. home, got separate toasters, towels, knives, etc. even switched deodorants. major symptom stunted growth GI issues. Definitely severe, life threatening concern I’m done growing. avoid gluten everywhere can, sometimes eating restaurants shared fryers grills necessary avoid causing much commotion group traveling.

I can’t imagine difficult effected people break hives reactions eating gluten. makes eating extremely difficult. Especially countries/areas less knowledge disease, really sucks. Yes Uh, there's 45 minute video epidemiologists, lay case. doubt watched since posted 25 minutes ago...  always thought highly WHO, recommended mask wearing started. 

They lost faith, there. CDC. 

It’s shame, need orgs like them, need work *for* public interest. pisses much employee large still operating club/gym required wear mask safety members required wear one safety.

Gyms one #1 places covid spread. dumb ass reason gyms hiding behind the, ""its hard breathe exercisingin mask"" argument. thats dangerous spreading fucking covid itself. First all, yes, impossible avoid forms slavery many products *claim* made outside China Chinese parts. (Not mention, China place slave labor goes on). even make effort buy products made outside China, screws parts may produced China without knowing it.

But even somehow know every single product made every single piece produced able find products produced slave labor, still multitude unethical practices nothing slavery. Look Chiquita bananas want example. people, easier spread faster ""catch up"". called exponential growth. need one? Worked Trump. Dude, Delta awesome. United AA could understand point. mean police we’re trying defund convert simple peacemakers? don’t foresee compatible objective Yeah agree fallacy. regards would work elsewhere (per scientist guy) I'm assuming distancing measures better measures opinion maybe?  understand someone can't stop this. killing people. huge fucking shit ton people. costing everyone massive fuckton money. sold shit suggest shut things every Jan/Feb mitigate flu deaths? people keep voting stupid, stupid people?   Rhetorical question...no need try answer that.

Maybe DeSantis stupid evil?  realizes stupid people buy bullshit?  rhetorical, need try answer question either. mean gonna sending kids public library, send school? What's different library that's gonna stop spread disease? That's said *after*. may 26, deny predictions totally wrong.    
But April 05 clearly stated COVID-19 could stopped “herd immunity, **or** combination immunity vaccination. It’s basically **the thing**.”” ""

My knee jerk reaction poor handling virus?

DeSantis way head. New Jersey met CDC's recommendation, reopen.   want read comment underneath good news post! according Lockdown TV. .. Swine flu IFR 0.02%, fumbled comparison. 0.1-0.3% numbers coronavirus. Well nobody comes back work shitty strategy. power masses. taking away pension? Ok. Go teach then.

You Americans really get trade unions working. Inviduals complaining absolutely nothing. Yes need train teachers used video calls attendance look everything using google Holiday business? Give precise example please. I've holidaying country, seeing loads there's hardly anything spend money on. 

Out curiosity covid tourist boost? could go wrong? live panhandle see beaches here. Nobody wearing masks packed. People stay 6 feet apart beaches hell groups 10. hit boardwalk bets off. restaurants packed masks you’ll find employees. think keep rising months come turn away anti maskers hospital, may intentionally go spread disease others spite.

Oh, think ship already sailed, we're tied bow whether like not. Covid 19 declared global pandemic March 11th WHO.  

Congress briefed January 24th. Yes done Canadians. Don’t tell fuck am. Don’t speak it’s matter fact Downvoted reading. Got me. upvote. Hahaha. 

As former educator, kid's school shut within week least one parent dose child Tylenol send school *magically* (sarcasm) ""get sick there"". 

I'd least two day, back teaching days. got common gave asking parents keep sick kids home (not many administrations would approve staying home absent doctor's note, problem itself). unfortunately, many people believe him. labeled propaganda live fact-checked. feat virus, need protect vulnerable get back work school. neighbor elementary teacher, spring semester essentially became super early summer vacation lot students. tried send work week establish communication parents. majority parents unresponsive though. government months put together plan ISPs curriculum development least provide passable online school year dick show around here. act like one could predicted this, really goes show ineffective whole system America.  german.

Edit: obviously joke me. like jokes. thats follow American approach combat rona. Deaths accelerating slowing, last couple weeks. since supplies rapid PCR tests, huge amount cases coming pipe. It’s taking week get results right now. Think though. realistic? literally every country entire world managed handle better United States? 

I get you’d jump conclusion initially take step back think you’re saying, really doesn’t make much sense all.   know LabCorp home one swabbing nostrils, brain swab. they're saying lockdown's limited effects, source reputable either. There's clear stastitical evidence lockdowns NYC Bergamo, amongst many others, significantly reduced active cases, hospitalizations, deaths. also evidence reduced transmission level cases increasing areas. “The window closing” rebut comments. You’re absolutely right. Sadly, think we’ll seeing worse numbers soon since cities can’t even lock anymore without Governor’s approval.  like jokes? Nearly month ago, 49 cases ICE detention center Farmville, Virginia, holds adult males. Now, 360 immigrants custody center, 268 confirmed cases coronavirus currently isolation monitoring, according agency statistics.

This disgraceful human rights violation. America sunk low? never forgive people voted this. 

We let people go, give medical care housing. Treat compassion, human beings.

The people allowed happen ones deserve locked up. We've done nothing magically went away! mean, specifically asked thought process/motivation comment offered it. realize trying play victim stayed it. Apologies. Gee, Dr. Fauci, sure seems like wearing masks earlier... know, back fucking lied everyone said masks good.

Fuck guy. I'm saying masks clearly make difference regarless setting. work one place, must also work another. marked ""this PPE device works hostpitals""

If virus Denny's going around verbally assaulting people wearing mask, might asshole. freely wear whatever want perfectly fine. threatened guy wearing mask, stop judgemental, probably none business. last sentence interview. think US reacting due phase spread US ongoing. 

The virus started spreading Europe earlier US, example France first case already December realize covid, found analyzing samples patient spring. Italy virus spreading lot realized. 

European countries took relatively swift harsh action realized scale spread largely past first wave. Also European countries less information US bad get, since Europe virus large outbreak Wuhan. Whereas US still ongoing first wave infections still spreading, even though US knew fully well bad got Italy Spain (and New York). US reaction varied, states lax approach, facilitating spread virus. 

Which means death toll increase coming weeks much faster rise Europe time, since European countries generally stricter approach largely past first wave.

So compare death toll US European countries first wave ended US, like European countries now. European countries stage US. city passed ordinance allowing hunting city limits, so... yeah. You’re confusing concept skepticism paranoia. Please tell know someone got hit bird rollercoaster cause comment awesome! Hurricane heading way put damper vacationers. ...and everyone clapped.

Except real time. didn’t say it. experience exactly point. person commented said making $100 hired privately parents would pay cut teachers experience. Probably yeah, economics understand then

Actually tell wearing touch touch mask coronavirus mask touch eyes mouth could get virus way. repeatedly putting mask could put risk assume people leave mask on! Allow hunting city need drive wilderness. unmarked vans pick never seen again. Denmark btw. really feel inclined spend time finding articles this, since expect people tell ""get infected die"" mentioned it. pisses much people ""of science"" could possibly people behind spreading idea herd immunity, I'll rather let y'all wallow impressions. literally mentioned people already used diving headlong beliefs told would get herd immunity hurry get people science communities. Trump mentioned country connection wanting schools states reopen. Perhaps people alitte aware actually going around them, instead taking opportunity take piss church communities.  live, well many areas, many deer.  happens lot US we’ve driven natural predators out. (If you’re interested, there’s amazing SHORT documentary reintroduction wolves Yosemite ultimately changed course rivers 

So “cull” deer. done naturally hunters, ironically among first environmentalists (ironic environmentalists often attacked liberal, whereas hunting often thought conservative. American politics, do?).

However, center Washington DC, there’s Rock Creek Park. keep deer control, paid snipers come night silencers. may may remembering incorrectly, think donate meat homeless shelters (???) Especially due freedom thing
Like much freedom owning dhit Ireland states anywhere else
What exactly states do? Maybe weed that's legal?
Honestly whole perspective freedom erratic flawed, everything done good, communism, fascism, democracy, laws make work flawed whole system fails literally everyone said ""monthly"", including you, even quoted you.

You literally said ""8 states capped $326 month"". 48 hours Texas; positive; currently day 7. far like head cold, headache 4 straight days.

a little seems counterproductive. places, mine, option fragile people travel medical reasons. problem getting doctors note saying travel medical reasons cannot safely mask. I’ll bet need pretty darn rare. unless case, mask airplane. party cuts education wants send kids back school worst pandemic lifetimes. Meanwhile refuse listen educated people. Weird right? totally agree think would make people lot compliant wearing masks. annoying. 

As person physical limitations due medical condition, truly business / lack ability required, mandated, requested, reasonably needed portion event / trip / activity / activity daily living / chore / etc...Guess what? (assuming situation like one, reasonable accomodation).

I wish everyone common sense. wish doctors like several good ones gave tough love kick ass patients needed.

Sadly, I'm probably one patients tells doctors treat like average human give tough love kick butt warranted. Yep. need mask problem mine. idea personal responsibility. Like drink driving personal responsibility drive try to. only. guess Trump told mentioned it. We’re edge, seems like government forcibly coaxing us it.

This beyond fucked up, everyone. basically leading cows slaughter.

Please put child dangerous situation. months school psychologically harmful child. children started schools? phones? Teach different skill. Teach conversations, read, enjoy nature, etc. socially distanced play dates lunch chat need be. keep schools closed still cafeteria staff make school meals low income children. little critical thinking doable!

Do know what's psychologically damaging lack socialization? Seeing janitor, bus driver, cafeteria worker teacher passing away COVID opened schools.

For love God, life, loved ones...please listen man That's neither sentence make sense. feel country big manage try splitting states. announced 105 billion dollars going schools mitigation smaller classes sizes including hiring teachers reopen. money go parents directly enroll private schools including homeschooling classes continue children's education.  uh, are? $80 hour?

Plenty people 25 (or whatever magical cut-off age is). want read article: UK spends 0.7% GNI (Gross National Income) foreign aid law. economy shrinks (like now) 0.7% absolute terms also shrinks. agencies told us wear mask simply wash hands (CDC). clear, thanks Many people trust them, disagree due religion dumb that's religion

Last checked everyone wear masks businesses area.  


Wearing mask everyone else wearing one protect Covid. Wearing mask protects others Covid. Bridezilla thinks wedding pics worth everyone life. Yay! 


Doesn't matter sickly. Covid randomly makes people die totally healthy. also leaves previously healthy people lifelong debilitating illnesses like lung disease. Also lung transplants. yeah..those wedding pics... 


No one go woman's wedding surprised anyone silly enough marry someone puts pics safety loved ones. Man idk believe see stats. swear couple days ago post 1/3 population (I think US) thinks covid deaths numbers released government higher actual death count. would thought Texans would side fence. slim, biggest danger getting pass someone else totally agree. alternative access medical care that’s reasonable exception. It’s essential. Trumps trying already Reelection campaign Please imply trying argue bring conspiracy theories dude. said wanted answers gave help. Didn’t suffer 4 months social distancing prevent this? buy time hospitals? Where’s tents, extra beds masks? sacrificed economy personal happiness, have; we’re situation nothing. 

Awesome! Fuck you, emotional support donkey travel me! I'm buying one seat two us though.  virus causes disease mate Ok Bill Gates keep goddamn microchips away us /s   he's president. pure speculation non-expert, think likely people taking/ taking less recommended precautions likely use Yelp. see gross generalizations regarding citizens inhabitants country, makes challege gross generalizations made regarding countries. thanks? Maybe? Cuba doctors less homeless. absolutely better. handled COVID-19 much better. gained 10 COVID pounds. Happy say I’ve lost working another 30. started working home intense schedule, never moved chair except go bed. Also lost mind stress snacking. I’m surprised didn’t gain more. Ill answer second question first: yes, manageable (heart disease/CHF, diabetes) cant really cured. takes time. Youre right, absolutely push get population healthier takes time isnt immediate solution pandemic. 

I think best solution would proper nation wide lockdown least weeks proper staged reopening plan involves mandatory, enforceable social distancing. BS had. Schools consider reopening spring. Herd immunity would great proper vaccination program, appears antibodies virus long lasting, infecting whole population (aside dangerous) likely pointless. guess vaccine comes require boosters/annual shots, tbd. Entitlement. people think rules apply really could sworn said “Santa’s jock strap” still understood meant, couldn’t life figure masks St. Nick you’d want drag whole mess.

Remember conversation. least seat belts aren’t likely kill anyone else. dumb self. matter, allowed enter countries already high viral loads. 

You simply declare want CCP destroyed, otherwise gonna process anything say. 

I've pleasantly inside home since February, nice👍 strains supposed cross-reacting antibodies spike protein. that’s God’s plan, judge? Grown assed men getting paid millions play sports still debating showing up.

X 1,000,000 Tell what, go post studies COVID-19 (you know, focus science) back I’ll side. don’t care 9 studies use bad methodology Intel can't even build 10nm chip reliably think Bill Gates developed microscopic GPS sensor package, processing data storage, plus communications hardware (or else what's point?) small invisible suspended fluid, instead patenting stuff becoming richest man world, well famous ushering next technological revolution, wants hide vaccine track redhat morons. 

Right. Lot's things. I'll bet don't.

If place like AFA can't handle discipline, social distancing, masks, NPI efforts useless. Please remove article April 15th Yeah problem Kinda like school kids magically immunity spread virus. they’re saying get it, get it’s okay really good immune system let’s forget grandma living maybe you’re parents underlying conditions might strong immune system suffer physically. Wow think Cuba better. Horrible. Doctor Italy also hypothesized people ADE second infections severe result.  ballsack chin virus. Beautiful virus. Big beautiful China virus. Invisible enemy. defeat invisible enemy. Masks, personal choice. Right jail.... One chilling tweets read whole thing back March April woman middle night NYC, said was: ""It's quiet outside except sirens."" Thanks, man.

But also, used to..... time, take look videos Bethel Redding. People like scary living shit me. also tried capitalize peoples generosity Carr Fire(first documented EF3 fire tornado). asking donations help pray city. water, blankets canned goods toys nearly 20,000 people Redding... prayer. Well not, men become snarky women.  saw old woman, oxygen tank wearing mask nasal cannula. really don’t see anyone good reason wear one.  mean widespread thing. could make sorts crazy headlines find specific peculiar stories like US like third world country money  kinda weirdo downvotes bot providing translation? r/suspiciouslyspecific sub warned us outbreak began China. medical conditions would exempt wearing mask conditions would confine hospital bed. Seems like lot experts disagree  think meant possible secondary infections far antibiotics. Tthe sad thing people actually player characters. dangerous amounts direct influence 'the game'. would surprised, many people stupid selfish... cool, long US tried protect police world. US cant save itself, guess longer protect allies. buy anything. Reddit runs AWS servers youre using amazon right now. sure!😊 remindme! 2 weeks

I guess we'll see theory holds up. Seems reasonable. usa, burning books since cool think equally terrible possibilities.

This going next big covid story. people's radars yet shit happening increasing rate. I'm sorry fuck believes Bill Gates wants microchip us.  Well, throw pile increasing evidence get sustained immunity. 

Crap. Idk kind reaction expect tell people they're hypocrite ok slave labor. 🥱 There's generally one group people certain part political spectrum pushes society towards system like America worse... call would make post political. could probably guess I'm referring though. Huh, imagine Two islands 5 million people mostly urban populations gets millions tourists per year places like China Europe. still something gets here. mean people risking lives go Chilis Applebees sooooo Ok. I’m Australia didn’t know encouraged tested America. You’re probably right. guy saying it’s paranoia. Sometimes it’s helpful hear people shoot stuff down.

It’s Charlie Daniels died hemorrhagic stroke, Earl Jones, Hugh Downs, Carl Reiner, Chris Trousdale *undisclosed illness*, Disney kid Sabastian Athie... 

Felt read many cause death “undisclosed illness”. 😂 you’re ultra rich get away wasn’t China country accused manipulating data point? Funny things gone since then. what, people go without medical care? Yeah were, blaming NYC ""shithole"". Assuming everything goes right vaccine trials, start getting proper vaccinations everyone least next spring/summer. know there's never screw ups logistics distribution things, right? haha.

I hope year. Hopefully time next year we'll less back normal. I'm realist typically optimist, Star Wars used say ""I bad feeling this"". might people voted governors people voting award...   ...this guy beat 2017

... Regarding treatment Coronavirus, ventilators used severe cases rather trying suck fluid lungs? seems like small plastic tubing could inserted lungs suck fluid. ventilator push air lungs? Nope, 3 words: test, trace isolate. mask cultists could get heads. Jock Idol According ""@dadoscovid19"" Instagram, Brazil performed 6,354,651 tests. means positivity rate 35% first two words, use Amazon It’s incredibly frustrating. Could different strain? 

No reason got Chinese variant first time European one next (or whatever, USA giant petri dish right now). Scary part go least next month unless serious hand brake pulled... way happen. Fucking bullshit. I'm honestly surprised increasing cases deaths reported. also realize sounds like I'm making whole data transfer CDC HHS conspiracy really unfortunate besides pandemic one worrying things mess. Kind like someone accusing defensive sounding defensive response. I'd say we're seeing now. going get worse. agree. NY Times comparison early haven’t seen anything while. Actually no- saying roll back using car seats, seat belts, safety measures cars, throw kids back back pick trucks. That’s equivalent argument spouting. considering less morbidity city whole, think important keep things perspective. children need go school, even saint anthony agrees, danger teachers minimal. new york even many active cases. Sounds like workers sue contract Covid number new cases per day rising. number deaths per day rising. Comparing May change either fact. Quixote ahead time... deaths day influenza?

What's influenza numbers relate something I'm familiar with? person responsible enjoy traveling it’s super shitty American now. Passports basically going Afghanistan status forever. BigStacks? like BigDummy. That’s administration touting last days trying deflect. It’s though haven’t followed what’s happening past 7 months around world lag time getting struggling eventually/possibly dying 2-3 weeks later. Ehhh, think safe space collapsed active areas site do, even BC. obviously done good job testing tracing, lulled populace complacent, refuse mandate masks. unbelievably frustrating. cases surging, we've never many looks like C-19 still alive well comment even makes sense joke, since don't. TX, U.S. important note competent government response, every single death June 1st forward could prevented. wish people would stop that. don’t know kids largely fine, death isn’t part this. know covid cause organ damage, even asymptomatic carriers. Kids quite isolated this, even “only” lose 10,000 kids country HUGE loss. Save copy page disappears. Masks save lives. People wearing masks, washing hands, social distancing.

There harm wearing masks. severe asthma wear mask every day without harm.

Covid19 contagious disease cure vaccine. kills 1-5% people get it. effective medicine it, wearing mask practicing safe distancing commonsense practices, backed hard evidence. effective countries (Europe, Asia) cities (NY) practiced them. Tremendously weak... it’s beautiful. Still got weeks up, dip we’ll see. new world order, wanting crash economy, us fear Covid take mind-controlling vaccine.

Wish could go /s say Maybe like episode Seinfeld: ""I square spare""

There tp roll, anticipate needing mess. mandatory mask orders make exceptions health, Walmart going tell people bring doctor's note. know they're called asymptomatic carriers really find people test positive symptoms belong one two groups:

1. presymptomatic infected - regular infected people still incubation phase

2. true asymptomatic carrier - people never develop symptoms, group infectious

Depending how, sample find different mix two. sample say, Wuhan nearly 3 month lockdown pretty much find true asymptomatic carriers, 300 found full population test. hand sample fresh new outbreak find asymptomatic people almost certainly presymptomatic infected. find lot presymptomatic many confirmed cases good news means first generation infection originating index case caught early, develop symptoms. yet, perfectly remote Job wants come work office. leaders fucking morons. I'm using Irish passport get germany weeks intend quarentine 14 days never think US again. I'm really scared they're going deny entry though I've since started. That's equivalent saying ""You're cool closing roads? want reduce number children die every year 12k?"" understand misleading reductionist way looking said? guys winning hard wish anything governments law enforce would stop put people behind bars, hell right people go shopping without dangerous fucking drunk drivers. Yeah like black plague... never eradicated combated vaccine Honestly I’m it. don’t dislike men I’m okay women opportunities. glass ceiling needs shatter. insanity. strategy dictates waiting bad thing happens taking steps combat it. So, close clubs, example, outbreak taxes resources, gets people sick helps push infection event control. course, would much easier preventing entire affair closing clubs. pattern wait, act, scramble, repeat. well said quit vaping, ain't playing around anymore. Mass shooters approve comment! Flattening 50,000 - 75,000 per day, ideal. mitigate make necessarily worse. limit public transport instead closing border. people drive/hike France/Spain. travel normal levels anyway. 

The point restrict travel countries higher incidence yours, like Europe done US, Russia, Brazil... example, US, restrict travel from, let's say, New Zealand, Greenland, way lower rate them? 

The way forward making lockdowns small posible, locking isolated neighborhoods/towns, contact tracing, ways people miss work isolation risk losing job\house. Oh, universal healthcare. Lockdowns ment get cases 0, reduce problem size test trace, get healthcare reinforced. point avoid healthcare collapse.

But hey, you... people breathing difficulties mask? wearing fucking full face respirator? wear masks day, absolutely issues lungs experienced second hand smoke 20 years. I'm side. attempting demonstrate four months similar number people died compared average four months heart stroke, biggest killer Americans. wanting add saying demonstrate toll had. negligible Well 100 people doom hey fuck right? What's 100 people, what's 140,000 people numbers right?  Hey! Take mask cough me. America! uk? Werent leading super power ran ground?  clue hard would fight remove 50% customers Walmart given time? would virtually impossible. admit people slowly store people around every aisle watching. Jesus Christ.

Why ""old stranger"" trick. Ya know, get old stranger give ya handy park bathroom! Fuck yeah. suit waste tax payer money. Yes. god, hard mandate masks, even enforced, least adds tiny bit social pressure, gives little bit shield workers children? really feel? acceptable risk 1 might child? Geesh. Please ever tell kids expendable. Therapy ain't cheap. *putz conspiracy Fedora*

Interesting numbers line Trump's voters. You’re getting lot hatred face stating facts arguing point. don’t agree sentiment vitriol spewed back pretty unjustified...All know disease dangerous it’s 100% China’s fault. US took seriously first, time started wane lot people didn’t care anymore... people died. people die.

It’s SARS. Nobody wants shit.  Hospitals *losing millions* Covid. bankrupting lot corners healthcare industry. idea *institutions* making money nuts. even big pharma really able massively capitalize this, Hydroxychloroquine boost since long generic even Remdesivir manufacturer gave shit ton away trials. insurance industry? 100k dead aren’t paying bills one live $100k debt? They’ll never pay either!

Expose cracks free market healthcare? Yes. Put America healthcare profitable situation? Nooooooooo. fuck sake realize jacked PPE costs are? relied PPE sterile environments *everyday* corona still need ORs clean rooms scarcity raised prices now? Every. Single. EMPLOYEE. Everyone level disposable PPE must wear daily. protect patients.

Making money? They’re gonna end laying people bc they’re making payroll people thinking Covid PROFITABLE?! MUCH NEEDED federal funding Covid patients? Fuck right bullshit.

Sorry really grinds gears. True, true. 

Bus Driver, please stop bus! would like get off! actually think VPN anything protect you? try eradicate disappear like miracle? Actually 10 seem better, 11+ risks young adults.  people want scapegoat. want admit shit fucked needs fixed. think blame something else, ignore it, go away. Much like war drugs, mass school shootings, economic disparity, corrupt government. people always find way rationalize pretend problem. countries disease became controlled basically eradicated society. Still feels bit strange think mouse movement productivity instead motivated people get job done. Idk, lot people go support Portland every night. Especially moms there. don’t think anyone gambling that. Unfortunately, people taking precautions ones left exposed. fucked responsible doesn’t help hardly days, helps irresponsible instead. frustrating Geez, one month ago say Horry County come sub connection yet another super stupid spreader activity: [Deeming strip club ""essential"" could It’s waste time responding people like you, draw conclusions things weren’t even stated, inferred. It’s illness. troll convincing. Usually trolls try really hard gaslight dont think dude Well, could avoid deaths shutting roads months road vaccine effective road treatment might become available, might prudent wait, no? pediatric nurse another sub talking exact issue. Kids quite isolated, said drs nurses children’s hospital works really scared happen kids go back. journalists.

PS: comment nasty! Lol ok scientists agree sound like know you’re saying must right Amazing America's response 9/11's comparatively puny death toll unified (for part). Y'all convinced starting war Afghanistan find guy found decade later Pakistan, starting war Iraq nonexistent WMDs, worthy causes wearing mask still topic debate?

If make [the American military industrial complex] dollars, make sense, guess. Everything life carries risk make judgement call whether worth it. Mortality rate Covid19 kids low risk starts compare daily activities judge acceptable risk.

The risks school opening related adults, kids. Comments dead kids confusing issue. made three counter points ton sources thrown make look better. let’s take one time.

1. said infectious symptom onset talking sars cov1 sars cov2. point still stands

2. point virus transmitted similarly sars cov1 potential negatives cloth mask use absolutely outweighs positive benefits. sars cov1 time mask wound helpful symptom onset. isn’t perfect enemy good. cost benefit. again, people rushing buy medical grade masks already short supply part cost benefit.

3. Emerging evidence one thing. making public health guidelines needs taken account. Best data still goes guidelines coronavirus behaves similarly sars cov1. Lol, oh irony Man people thread classist AF. There’s nothing wrong shopping dollar tree. Jesus. 

Not poor people totally ignorant. folks area dirt poor wear masks (80-90%) matter are. see worse behavior nicer side town. claim hospitals get paid certain amount every coronavirus death. someone gets car accident dies hospital, hospital claims coronavirus death get $30k

Not even slightly based reality, thats story side. ducde math right there. Literally rounded 3.8 4 make math easier, 5. reality might lower many asymptoptotic wont test u r technically correct. Congrats, wear mask typo 7/1 death moving average? dont remember Texas even posting 100 day point.

Edit - definitely stupid! something could easily missed read headline: Ms. Party thang herself

I misread first. actual number cases 10x number confirmed cases. also assume case number graph lagging true infections 2-3 weeks. really sad part is, wasted 3 months actually shit prepare reopening. preventable. instead spending 3 months indoors, get spend probably close 2 years, instead anything productive we’re wasting it. Poof gone. 2 years lives drain reason hundreds thousands dead. bet break 300,000 deaths US we’re lucky, Trump leaves office Jan. doesn’t, might well say goodbye next 5 years millions lives. [He can. understands doesn’t care people die long gets votes ignorant masses. I'm sure American idiots still saying ""the flu kills people!"" hate one need links send people Like said ""only year"" time around time superstressed. keep stress check. get can't wear masks safe, wear costumes holes masks protest? even mean? pandemic supposed minor inconvenience health issue. can't people follow social distancing careful use energy go mock people try safe? 1% may seem like nothing, sit math one percent neighborhood, county, state? Percentages people, make non living objects use stats. actually sad called number one country world highest infections rapid rate improved testing (of course tests mean cases cases mean tests well) people dont believe disease, conspiracy them, one guy re-election! Etcetera oh freedom rights? people would responded Ebola virus Covid 19. like trying put forest fire one tree time. Brazil 1000+ day weekly average months now. mandated masks 3 months ago. I've read people legitimately believe insurance payouts hospitals ""beneficial"" report covid deaths, hence inflated numbers. swear, stupid ass conspiracies propagate trying prove negative. say argument like that? surface level inflating numbers makes zero sense bull shit made reason one actually refute, real right? give police ability selectivly arrest people want to. anyone want guees demographic skew implementation? work cleaning northern half state. clean sorts buildings several hundred clients different backgrounds. Industrial, Clinical, education, retail...

The 2 highest cases per client police/security religious services. clients follow protocol groups seem refuse wear masks, wash hands, distance.    Fines possible jail time following. 

Honestly, people probably want China style control. not. someone dies covid every 72 seconds, that's kinda crazy. Estimates 5-20% year asymptomatic symptomatic vs. 3-11% year symptomatic only. Estimates IFR asymptomatic symptomatic 0.02-0.2%, depending strain year. 0.002% pretty mark matter spin it.

COVID way deadly flu, order 10x well established Making sure Trump loses. Ensuring economy remains toilet Trump gets blamed it. happened, Bill Maher openly wished economic catastrophe Trump would lose 2020. clear motive hyping disaster election year. hates Trump anyone? establishment media. establishment media hate anyone? Trump. establishment media wants Trump lose, they're pushing make impact coronavirus severe possible. want quick recovery, quick recovery maximally make Trump look bad. fear, US take years recover. Maybe decades. Nothing United. States. makes sad. Remindme! 4 months people would Riot case usually smart enough go outside humidity helped, Houston would sitting pretty. Six mutations? source?

Also someone Reddit said it’s likely mutate become less dangerous less infectious. random dude Reddit though evidence backing up. Would interesting though know likely become worse Honestly feel like people would point anger china super racist forever. fuck life.. getting every 4-6 months 2018 2019. Turns black mold. Moved new place sick year # PSA:

# lots people claiming medical condition can't wear face-masks. legit, others not. one people condition like severe asthma, claustrophobia, conditions truly impede ability wear mask feel you. best 1) Carry papers diagnosis available, 2) Wear face-shield instead mask would considered acceptable alternative places.

I claustrophobic friend no-troubles wearing face-shield, guys. least freaking pandemic. Carry papers case get stopped entering establishment. lots crazies there, important distinguish yourself. big deal. week got it, I'm asymptomatic able spread give brother.

I'm Europe. able spread brother? still live together? would lockdown. met family members outside wife child 2 months. understand people need help, managed. mother 70 sister managed groceries her. put bags ""isolation"" mothers property least day, mother went got it.

We got 15 confirmed cases county start pandemic. still, us shops wear mask. do. Granted, badly, try. Whoa, real? Coupled flu season entirely possible. Looking reddit news. Everyone seem hate feds hates trump. hate strong one listens cares. That’s it’s continuing spread. Lots people don’t seem care. see people groups, mask, tons people constantly hanging parties. It’s Baby Jesus wanted. Yep, it’s crazy. point countries say “It literally didn’t way” it’s like stops people’s brains second. 40% country doesn’t think problem - Florida could go strike.

They demand protection afforded Trump. Everyone gets tested appearing front Dear Leader.  waste time use lot word trick live NYC think Republican death machine anything disaster went here. incompetent leadership get pass blaming Republicans, that's what's happening.  nothing value lost. can, want to, raised expectation individual freedoms supreme right others. That's roughly line hand-and-eye estimates too; least 4 weeks 1500+ deaths per day (assuming heavy lockdown today stop spread). 

We lot tests first spike - think many cases first spike non-test diagnoses, people presented symptoms clear really need test (at least NY NJ, hospitals full them). % positive cases numbers may that. can't imagine testing fraction infected testing stuff started.

The question US hit 200k counted deaths this; mention excess mortality causes. think we'll hit 500k unless states utterly refuse anything, open schools masks all; get vaccine middle next year. Wonder much longer Herberts gonna sit ass ""hope"" things get better. Schools reopening wave knocks down. matter way spin opening schools terrible idea. Unless get virus control couple hundred cases whole United States going successful. alternative plan millions school children. least right summer programs means keep occupied parents work. Come fall lot options go away. sure, part children probably end safe bringing virus back parents things go bad.


And matter many precautions put place going happen. NBA created bubble keep players isolated still sure end working. honestly think keep children contracting spreading virus? + signs end March present represent ~140,000 deaths highest counts corresponding weeks last 7 years.

Given current count COVID deaths ~146,000, suggest reports less accurate? something I'm missing formula?

Though guess that's assuming we'd hit top end excess deaths data every week, pretty unlikely.  I've slipped &amp; hung friends like everything's normal twice since March (both times cases lower here, thankfully), I've mostly trying careful &amp; *so* depressing watching siblings keep hanging IRL friends SOs I've mostly either family house. brought therapist, &amp; told ""it's OK different"", like could ever CHOICE. :( really bizarre economic impact never makes front page here. possible worry cases deaths also feeling way economy. binary thing. highly unlikely hit death tolls high previously. 

The eviction moritarium estimates saying 50% businesses closed permanently freak everyone out. Global supercorporations going take this. Mass unemployment civil unrest. Elites think control resentment decades making burst. chances still high actually reelect guy. Last checked. international community allow exposed cruise ships fly Florida Iowa give us first 10ish cases. federal government would locked coming USA full 40 days know fucking word ""Quarantine"" fucking means maybe US need shut down. Iowa may never seen single case that. Thats kinda works.....right? might want look R95 (i.e. painters mask). Bulkier effective, you. say lot use one way vents reduce effectiveness preventing transmitting it, still offer top level protection. 

That's got immunosuppressed little sister since get N95's. China charge Chinese vaccine development. What's wrong that? That's outbreak. outbreak. also kills someone life-threatening emergency nothing covid ambulance turned away nearest hospital, happening Houston. 

I wonder many peripheral deaths happening - people would otherwise saved, get medical attention time hospitals overwhelmed covid look like rate growth new infections/day slowing though, encouraging. We're hovering 67-68k/day range (when broken weekly average) individual days ranging around 62k (weekend reporting) around 75k (mid/late week reporting). Two weeks ago would've thought would hit close 100k new infections/day point given quickly spiking upwards. looks like number new cases/day still growing, lot slowly predicted week two ago. Hopefully holds number new cases / day starts receding. anything good come pandemic personally improved dental hygiene. organ wig farming genocide China. hear thing time. understand conspiracy theorists think Democrats much power somehow decided let Trump get elected. alone. would adopt like stray cats could. Feed give safe shelter. much. looked days ago could get US help easy going work (I Medical Field much offer). India, USA, UK on... doesen matter want suffer ends. try feels always like enough. beginning lots ads raise empathy vulnerable song: send love. Also antimasker reads maybe. hate you. wrote things anger end wish suffer, happienes end this. 

A lot people would like help think you. Maybe give little favor back help least stand again.

Stay safe. cour$e Yes. getting nuance sarcastically parroting idiots saying won’t get fucking jock said realize hospitals getting paid Covid patients aren’t doctors lying deaths money...which saying also. isn’t understanding /s making fun idiotic statements deniers. People telling it’s beautiful miracle. messed up.

The Public Health 'recommendations' returning school safely.

Teachers want 'requirements' recommendations. School Next? Nooooooooo totally work well! True, true. super annoying. I've discussions virus every comment new argument correct shoot down. stupid. makes sense (these things never do): flu suddenly killing thousands usual, summer months opposite hemisphere, means there's *another concurrent pandemic occurring alongside COVID-19*, meaning ***there absolutely reason keep proactive measures***.

The truthers' argument shockingly, cosmically weak Planck-scale fluctuations quantum foam send tumbling down.  It’s almost 2am right now. 13 days ago fell stepping house landed hard right knee. painful, cried awhile floor. next days ok knee ginormous red. Doc thinks broke it. RA already, pain doable, usually joints feel like I’m meds. Tomorrow find sure broken. is, require leg brace, I’m going admitted hospital long term care facility healed (I help home) COVOID HUGE worry happens immune system suppressed moment could easily get easy get even do. screw people say “death part life” I’m 42 ready die broke knee help home. Screw all! Everyone job working home isolating. Someone said conference call said “That thanks us staying safe!” made three counter points ton sources thrown make look better.

Sources provided make arguments look better, proofs __asymptomatic transmission already mainstream news *late January*__. health authorities reverse stance masks April. 

So still think cloth masks harm good symptomatic stage COVID-19? 

I see cost people rushing buy medical grade masks short supply. However, important note masks long gone *(Chinese expats wiped supplies sent back China)* Americans realized need go buy one. health authorities told public wear sort face coverings like April instead lying effectiveness masks discourage people trying get them. Heck, even thought wearing bandana February ""hostility"" towards mask wearers.

Once again, asymptomatic transmission already known late January implicate SARS-CoV-2 behave differently SARS-1. lack precaution rapid-spreading epidemic inexcusable.  well point everyone freaking covid reality likely die many things second given day.  No, heat body faster it’s area exposed skin left. evaporational sweat cooled face replaced hot humid breath face. threw heat exhaustion chemical plant Texas mandates masks worn times matter what. able take mask I’m outside 10+ feet away nearest person heat index 110 I’m already required wear full flame retardant jumpsuit. I’m used heat chug water hydro homies, acknowledge additional heat stress add making safety policies. Depends close trailer park enough teachers go strike, state do? Fire them? talking couple thousand teachers strike. taking tens thousands teachers going strike. state cannot fire them. gone single Walmart, Target, national retailer *enforced* masks yet. Every single visit multiple people unmasked.

South Florida I'm US I'm curious now.

Does anyone know much impact protests amount cases?  You’re onto something . Agreed. point masking reduce spread. fact BC's policy wait spread react reckless.

Henry pro mask since beginning way behind jurisdictions even mildly recommending usage. 

She told us bad info masks (they work, create false sense security, trained professionals wear properly etc, etc) want admit people call Saint Henry maybe, maybe, wrong. 

Unlike Fauci admitted mask lies, trying ignore masks hope we'll forget. sources por flavor?

I'm inclined agree you. wanna read em weep.

In state, seem timeline intrigue.

Edit: reddit get downvoted asking information. Objectively, wild. somehow makes people dying something preventable OK? Hey don’t mock them! know patients low income class folks, blacks Hispanics too? 

I’d say hospitals turned away need investigated. prepared extra beds. writing wall communications emails circulating hospital admins need audited. Trump said that, knew bullshit Eradication option... Except dude claims PhD virology. You’re absolutely right could possibly good thing? Imagine calling people agree idiots

imagine caring would imagine that's bad testing long good chunk tests checking people already dead. initial spike probably went undiagnosed. 7% absurd. war. POTUS helping side. 7k confirmed, definitely higher that. currently leading cause death world moment. (Just based confirmed deaths). bet Jake Paul 3 trillion dollars. Jesus. anything’s hell everlasting torture. depressing father truly believes this.  staff cared about. bad publicity.  article read day (possibly sub idk) saying treatments patients get worst state virus around 4 6 times LESS deadly March/April amazing reduced lethality quickly did.

But means simply comparing gives false result bad reality 4 6 times worse - number march would 4000 6000 without treatments. 

I hope guys America get handle virus right looks like struggling hard sign getting better. walmart isn’t really enforcing area either. went day group/family people behind together looked ones definitely needed wearing mask (older, obese, definitely healthy looking) claimed either COPD asthma didn’t wear mask. dudes front black shirts let right inside maskless.

edit: state mandatory mask order squash testing reporting pretend like gone. Hard pretend like bodies there. commented previously unfortunately. sister paramedic saw dramatic increase home deaths dead tested covid never really knew increase due higher reported infection rate people afraid go hospital. point, there’s point wide shutdowns bars anymore. 

I'm jammed together someone airplane *lot* longer I'm bar.

And play movie concert, matter. definition.... that's according economic research group actually determines got watch first hand bad Pence fucked HIV outbreak years back. Humans lived like existence. (very) recently broken tribes en masse. Probably something large percentage population feels lonely. should.

As scientific matter, phenomenon observed.  literally true every type diagnosis/procedure hospital. Medicare pays MS-DRG system prospective payment system. Fraud abuse handled OIG external auditors quite aggressive—Medicare interest overpaying. ignorant subject, want learn, basic googling.

They get paid 20% pneumonia diagnosis, example. get paid orders magnitude many times person heart attack. Hospitals don’t “fudge numbers” say pneumonia patients heart attacks. armchair experts always look conspiracy something 1% knowledge about? (Source: work closely hospital finance billing) Herd immunity threshold likely well 75%. Uhhh.....so Trump dismantling Obama pandemic taskforce literally governmental oversight (at all) pandemic Trump's fault?

HOLY SHIT. dumb fuck. looked Portland? Put kids offices employees wfh? Hell, Utah shut down. Governor even make statewide mask mandate. disappear believe fake news - Karen may number cases, spread country much difficult try slow/prevent spread city-to-city. “They’re inflating numbers make look bad hurt reelection chances.” simple solution.Everyone coughs rich. wonder DeSantis' panicked calls White House figured recent changes? Sorry loss. think right thing though  naked guys eating faces 
Not We're going look total increase deaths (from 2020 vs average year) truly figure death toll mutates quickly. We're already dealing five two hundred variants, depending whose labs listen to.

Odds good mutations weaker helps thing die off, stronger freak one always come raring back sometime. Upside cases seem leveling bit, another two weeks rises deaths. doctor doesnt understand concept....i guess doesnt want see drink death really? think surgeons trained breathers? like go wear-a-mask-and-exercise program? making think book Black Plague read long ago. judging mortality rate percentage priests died. You’re wrong that. guess I’m assuming govt pull stops order aid fast vaccinations, end goal getting economy back running asap. I’m futurologist fuck actually good insight Where's money coming from? think without medical care could see 14 days onset death. medical care deaths greatly delayed. [Korea shows deaths Daegu outbreak people infected within week. deaths widely distributed peak deaths (use 7-day rolling average) 25 days peak cases, tail going 2 months. includes death reporting day (variable location), delay infection testing (probably quite low particular outbreak).

There's also 4.5-5 day median delay infection (symptom) onset. sign even thought I'm political scientist health expert? job man done simply phenomenal. 

***He diamond ocean shit. Praise him.*** might Houstonian speaking fellow Houstonians. Weirdly, whenever point number overall deaths excessive, COVID not, mysteriously vanish.  agree points bad time financially hospitals, overall. 

What referring [Medicare pays 20% premium COVID patients. OP implied crazy Alex Jones level conspiracy theory suggest hospitals financial incentive test many patients possible, even patients don’t severe case original reason hospitalization something COVID. 

My point things true time - hospitals bad financial straits also incentives identify COVID cases (even severe). check lineage. countries give citizenship X generations someone lived there. would make moving lot easier. Median one used referring describing demographic trends. relevant irons misleading effects rare outlying data points compared mean.

Like median income average commonly see huge exponential disparities wealth like have, mean income misleading.

The relationship age odds death, general, C-19 also exponential, exponential distributions, mean commonly useful type average. Nice turn backs country made wealthy suits you. Indiana state much? people really caring now?  Looks like Home Depot on. can’t breathe even without mask it’s best interests stay inside. Covid almost certainly deadly lungs fucked.

Lifelong asthmatics cystic fibrosis patients wear masks without issue. lungs worse theirs... That’s get following science 😎 🧪 Yeah read paragraph immediately thought ""What people simply CAN'T ""They instructed public health health safety code quarantine, isolate, wear mask, go community, tell people they've contact they've contacted COVID-19 they've failed so,"" Satterfield said.

Without society without morality justice, expect people act like human beings. genetic lottery. Young healthy? chances ""mild"" case going hospital good. second time catch it? knows?  please move country like Germany embraces science instead ignoring politicizing like U.S.  looks nice hair like that? likely coating oxidizes. paper referring lifelong, severe asthma. Masks really problem. spreading dangerous ideas get people killed. always choice real lockdowns something one wants do. mean really, Finland lockdown initially, would similar circumstances. hurts much solve problem. would try hard go mitigation try live normally possible facemasks, distancing, remote work/teaching, limited quarantines, extra hygiene/cleaning. nations aim for. Normalize living constant threat virus, mitigate damage/spread, enduring damage vaccines become widely available. forget PPE seize resale scheme. That's cartoon supervillain stuff. True. thing that’s unusual big deal.  headlines. say something blunt without usual political spin, reporters jump like controversial.

Usually something common sense sort obvious, like this. really hope people US banned travel outside shit sorted out. can't risk effort we've made destroyed spoiled tourists. Yet many countries kiss-to-greet culture better situation America. can't turn blind eye like someone, Fauci's sensationalism partly reason guys bad. 

I'm going get downvoted care, hopefully guys realize soon enough. called Camp Encourage. want decrease anxiety, quit Adderall nicotine immediately. Stimulants generally make anxiety, much, much worse frequent, combining two recipe racing heart anxiety bordering paranoia. isn’t anecdotal evidence, simply type “Adderall anxiety“ Google you’ll see mean. Yeah. go beach, visit relatives, even carpool without much worry. Really stuff can’t due small amount virus that’s still things like indoor dining, sports, bars. Massachusetts mostly back normal nearly two months now, yet see another spike Welcome back Zoom hell long term edition kids! TrUsT GoVeRnMeNt data science numbers side, glee party over!

Unless course virus suddenly shot 100% CFR (which explains every poster seems act sub)  Well duh, Black Plague vanish either. Seconded. fine  mean, people see, via 1st-2nd-3rd hand, there's room hospitals, it'll probably naturally happen. kinda like people spending money right know future holds. Stores might open, still essentials many people since we're probably gonna need money last rest year.

Similarly, going potential death sentence (hey, got first car accident March. Shit happens) due room/staff hospitals, people probably start locking anyways die. least, smart ones will. maybe Darwin take rest.

You hide numbers want, can't hide sirens, freezer trucks, mass graves. forget Sinovac's vaccine also going phase 3 trial Brazil week. far inactivated virus vaccine so. flat mortality rate even half story.

The vast majority influenza deaths occur elderly, young, immunocompromised. long fall categories (most people don't), chances dying flu basically nil.

Comparatively, COVID's mortality rate higher overall, age distribution lot flatter. still skew towards aged otherwise vulnerable, risk young adult immensely higher flu. 

And even mentioned long term disabilities **mild**"" infections causing non-negligible number cases. Housing control. Normal people need live 16 people.

You mean costs housing used control people?

There really reason housing expensive US. tell can't do! I've seen theory tossed around may abundance ACE2 receptors testes. worrying wonder top 5 cases TX,CA &amp; NY top 3 last two top 5 CT &amp; NJ. screeching noises anymore, they've put greased rollers since June. Huh. US population 328 million less. sure includes territories entities puerto rico . significant percentage US! include undocumented people, may add another 20 million count,

**Hope vaccine works**. manufacturing quick. 100 million doses say 5 years going help much aspects virus. one year time frame seems better even possible. We're number one! We're number one! Take Florida Arizona hahaha

*cries corner know least 10 last two days two hospitals work at, made numbers yet...*  I’m worried friends family living US. Yup NE already proper lockdown enjoying benefits People honestly believe hospitals overwhelmingly calling anything even might COVID COVID death. get funding. Like, come on. might’ve little understandable beginning people knew jack squat disease. point, that’s horseshit thing believe. do, it’s people divided tribal point. It’s 80% country split two cults follow cult leaders way. Breaks heart. Best friend ever (long deceased) lived Houston. I'm worried family. Embrace suck now, toast. watch TV year happens,  Fake news We'll busy worrying Betelgeusean variant Covid1244511K then. 

(It's transmitted telepathically.) mentally ill things like that.... like father like son Reality governments actively encouraged thousands people riot streets weeks end, and, month later, reporting surge cases. reality. narrative things happen. wait it. Australia conservative country, cultural attitudes fundamentally different southern US, without confederate flag.

They got lucky travel proximity Asia means get C-strain virus much later, luck ran out.  could used national guard/army/FEMA get medical supplies like masks early days saw really played out.


The message loud clear, own. Every single chance got federal state government refused help COVID. makes think they'll suddenly drop bullshit actually help sudden?


If handled anything like masks were, federal government start buying vaccines hoarding states, hospitals country make shady deals smuggle vaccines hospital.

Because remember, literally happened masks... Yep, there's anyone trust now, ""Experts"".

No proof human human transmission, masks harmful, airborne, closing borders racist, thanks STFU bullshit speculations proof. DONT proof, lean side caution think last two things negate benefits listed though case people forgot. idiots saying ""we quarantines US, that's something *other people* do"" back February warning everyone could take thing seriously. Yeah, issue they're allowed occupy position all. I'm physician accept appointment secretary housing urban development... shit.

What i'm saying would great people great one thing realize greatness rarely transcends skill. 

Furthermore, greatness cultivated years mastery performance thus likely specialized relevant finite scale. Yet one reason among long list many hell want return home right now. output valve means protect others, best practice would find medical n95 would difficult putting surgical mask/cloth mask n95 I... what? Congratulations america! Yes whole world inflating numbers harm Trump's reelection.

Every world policy based harm Trump. Disingenuous. 7 day average 860 hit 65k cases. Case numbers 150% bottom 3 weeks ago (now they're 200%), death numbers 50% bottom. proportion return was, country who's initial peak.

i mean deaths would literally never increase. jesus. worst well behind us.  told imagine this, every cafeteria every school across country. Poppycock Yeah heard bs read actually surprised it’s untrue idk believe anymore. don’t understand would wanted. Well post it? POTUS allowing people choose want do

You WANT give authoritarian power Donald J Trump? agree. also invalidates people's real mental response. suspect reality much nuanced would interesting understand. uninsured.  economy destroyed whether something not. Killing 1-6% population year good economy. Already pay-cut first lock down. 2nd lockdown full blown unemployed. Wash hands, wear masks. folks Missouri send people congress, sending best... WINNING!!!! Finally Trump’s promise came true!! Ffs Found guy says “shh”!

He thought folks! smart commenter here! Huge brain. wishful thinking...

if President remotely gave shit Americans would’ve signed ago Look countries got outbreak put control reopening.

Hell Europe finishing football tournaments stopped Feb/March. domestic (national) tournaments get weekend continental ones start August first week.

&amp;#x200B;

It people like wanted take half-measures throughout pandemic extending problem causing people die.

A complete national level shutdown along good financial aid government would brought things control enough reopen reopening wearing masks follow guidelines would allowed economy recover.

&amp;#x200B;

But republicans can't think beyond next 1 week situation cases deaths rising economy still toilet. 

Good going. back forth. People conveniently ignore possibly likely believe statements articles. absolutely insane here... I've holed home months still can't go anti-mask/pro-virus idiots could sit still two weeks. idiots acting like everything back normal month!

Did help governor undermined Dallas' mayor masks fines wearing them. So, even though local government wanted proactive take precautions legally prevented so. Yea arrogant internet people vastly superior every way. One day great reddit rise become benevolent dictator world needs.  mean there's tons videos doctors nurses thing. One doctor put 6 surgical masks on. Still 99% O2 saturation. people can't breathe. like feeling hot air. Man.. can’t quick Google search you? Washington state.. maybe could use Google haven’t heard find states care. worry, we're probably less 1/5th way pandemic - it'll make way back you. virus nothing time.  Good News: flu virtually nonexistent much Southern Hemisphere right due COVID measures.

The Bad News: already hear shrieking truthers: “THEY’RE COUNTING FLU DEATHS CORONAVIRUS DEATHS!1!!” Meh. aint dead..... says COVID survivor spent 30 days ICU hooked ventilator. It’s noble sure say almost giving people reason less safe it. lot us truly willing get sick see change headline surely used opposition reason say protesters aren’t COVID safe. commend man though. Also much easier contain virus land mass 30x times less size US. made much easier European country closed borders another. can’t states, much interstate travel, I.e. many live NJ commute PA NY live WI commute IL it’s always conservative fucktard’s like take away civil liberties. anybody wants civil liberties removed fear mongering scared little Republicans Maybe I’m making clear. doesn’t causes deaths. 140k, 4 months, would saved simply wearing mask several weeks licking windows. don’t give shit people die prematurely fat unhealthy. regular people dropping dead ‘merka. Sounds like mental illness really, never know. knew guys wore guns Obama president. really felt unsafe, kind making lame-ass political statement. stopped carrying awhile back, easier to. I'm flavorist. I'll admit it. Lol literally work pharmaceutical distribution. know I'm talking about. I've part government deals pay supplies reason. chuckle head pretending understand market  Spent time 4chan, exactly one talking points. 

There valid screw ups mislabeling people died covid sticking examples like barnacles. said last 5 questions MOCA test hard. first question identify animal elephant three possibilities. two rhino lion think. 

Basically dude dumb shit unless dementia every question test easy fuck. One count backwards 100 7. Another asking day week was. Shit third grader would easily pass. years 0 social interaction person. Scary stuff. Well said, link article? mean, cut vegetables easily. run field, arms spread, needs 2 people behind catch corn. doesn’t fake president anything it? He’s got control Senate. weak leader? What’s take this?  Yall stay south border. want canada till figure shit Lol! funny. Globally 9.9 million cases outcome cured dead. 600k dead.

Is whole world making numbers? majority us aren’t benefactors money going around anyways keep pretending somehow making exchange say ""cool, deaths low, there's 1 100,000 chance. lets dumbasses make 2 100,000 10 100,000 100 100,000. Wash hands, wear mask, dont stupid"" don’t know I’m going make break joint, guards shift change. slip wire exchanging stories one gassed protesters. need someone fly plane. fly plane can’t you? Conspiracy idiot: Bill gates wants implant tracking devices.
*uses smartphone gps on, mobile data giving permission every app* ""flu kills people"" ""it's calculated risk, like driving"" news that?! Thankfully one going make mistake nursing homes NY did. actually easy. Pay people stay home 4 weeks. Military delivers MREs anyone can't stock 4 weeks worth food. Keep borders closed non essential travel. Covid dies, move lives. would cheaper begining, yet get politicians can't see this. think states could deemed successful honestly. MN locked early we're open covid making appearance again. fair enough become bad guy, that's cocksuckers want. weak want feared damn whoever take them. sickening.  Granted, useless shitty American police are. help. many Americans calling police simply make things worse matter innocent are. really can't trusted anything seems like. serve protect capital rich. That's it. *are testing 1000 daily deaths 3 times last 8 days still increasing? deaths week since new cases increasing, deaths decreasing. trend likely continue. there's tech billionaire shitting right now, mark zuckerberg creating platform ""like"" conspiracy theories ""friends"". deleted account 5 years ago, desire return. Here’s another way look it. 44,000 people year die breast cancer. Covid going drown breast cancer deaths. We’ve already tripled breast cancer rates year half over.

I’m glad brought cancer though. really puts perspective. people March pink ribbons, breast cancer nothing compared this. 50/50 masks England. reasons follows:

Against:

1. experience wearing masks result going see sorts nonsense, people pulling masks use mobile phones pulling masks talk: basically, touching mouths touching items otherwise may done.
2. Lack experience causing people wear proper fashion get close people thinking wearing mask haphazardly sufficient.

There real possibility masks cause problems solve.

For:

1. People already getting far close comfort people supermarkets shops. Social distancing gone window places. So, mask necessarily going lull anyone false sense security get closer people already are.
2. one big positive: pubs open seen lack care town city pubs undoubtedly rise infections coming weeks. Masks help prevent people going business pubs coughing germs supermarkets shops.

What would really like know this: driver behind government's change mask policy?

Why social distancing longer mandated terms supermarkets certain amount customers shop given time, one way walking systems on? real possibility government policy replace social distancing masks one reason only: social distancing leads fewer customers types industries obvious impact economy.

I believe could well 'economy' driven decision lead away important effective measure containing virus: social distancing.

What would like see businesses owners opportunity stay afloat, social distancing guidelines mandated. far early relax social distancing replace masks. know experience social distancing contained virus brought numbers infections around 500 day country. look across water United States learn experience. learn Italy horrible feeling we're going learn time 'round either. Deaths home spiked NYC April. wonder almost died Captain Cook landed Lmao. You’re one made contest.

Your gloating tantamount 8 year old’s “nana nana boo boo” ""The number high US country honest it.""  Barbadian mob assault someone inability grasp perspective evidence think people care. certainly do. People way worried deaths severe illness, fine. mental health still get covered too, hasn’t extent needs be. partially blame media, constantly focusing deaths misery people afraid unable look away helps ratings, think somewhat complicit poor mental health aren’t going really cover it. me, like them, honestly. intention ever kill anything except hours boredom lmao. kinda see collective safety, read almost everywhere contagious 10-14 days. go house wear mask wherever go, I've hanging crush (since I'm immune I'm taking advantage short immunity certain anymore, I'm giving 8 weeks) couple weeks come gets tested weekly job. think I'm contagious anymore even though still vertigo headaches. never tested positive, tested negative twice, got tested day 11 day 16, doctor says waited long. even know ever shedding virus great way.

ETA: traced infection date May 28th symptoms starting June 5th, long since first 10-14 days. Honestly American I'd buy gun too. Things going downhill country seems unstable.

Plus obviously belief ""nobody help you, protect yourself"" seems true. Who's gonna help robbed? past months shown American police give fuck hate good job all. can't trust all. shit aerosolized still ineffective. way generation Return drive-in movies!  got link? Oh worry happen week Chinese isnt race  masochist dabble seeing absolute worst subreddits can't decipher anymore guess. ICUs testing centers US cities capacity. mortality rate’s downward decline begun reverse states already. climate crisis ten twenty years Lmao extensive heroism looks like. don’t understand people don’t get this. taking victory lap still hotspots enough time passed started relaxing everything know truly worked. still another 3-4 weeks remotely say beat it. Yes, COVID patients. specifically COVID deaths, two distinct things... Everyone's Darwinist see survival fittest play out. COVID taking weak strengthening gene pool perspective? didn’t say it.. think protest major cause spikes.. however many papers pushed media say BLM caused 0 spread. that’s case.. sports venues fine. RemindMe! August 30 article 2 weeks old, imagine things worse  Lumber shortages going drastically drive price building home, lowered wages industries affect demand long run whether job stable not. 

Also fire state government job state local governments hit immensely hard COVID new help federal government currently proposed. Hopefully department strong union otherwise cuts going made, whether it’s benefits, pensions, salary, equipment, hours.

Working homes must know shouldn’t throw stones you’re sure foundation glass not. I'm Canada able buy masks since middle May. Hard find Amazon big box stores though. ""Hehe im danger"" Maybe *forgot* two three zeros end number? one trusts numbers China claims, they've hiding true numbers beginning. Canada It’s going town lol. death toll goes pretty consistently every day. Anecdotally people know who've sick died 14 days seems super short. 


My neighbor got sick (so probably caught 5 days+ that), waited 3 days get tested, took 10 days trouble breathing finally went hospital, got sent home sorta looked like way getting better. week see ambulance pull hear finally dying another week+.  


For almost month getting dying. 


A family friend ventilator almost 3 weeks already, he's sick month he's well :( made better choices, I’m sympathy.   india bad state weeks getting worse guys? looked rate deaths somebody gets put vent? playing semantic games here. said think hospitals fudging numbers, fact get paid somebody covid positive indisputable. Yes, say: ""How C-19 steal life average victim average victim left c-19?""

Because: ""The average age new coronavirus patients dropped approximately 15 years compared patient data months ago.""


Young people becoming infected often. die rate older people, ones skew average-years-of-life-stolen figures. Turn back worked equipment use manufacture medicine, one LAST companies would take vaccine from. Easter 2030 sure time illness onset admission similar survivors non-survivors (P=0·958) median duration 7·0 days (1·0–41·0) survivors 8·0 days (0–30·0) non-survivors (Table 3). median time illness onset discharge 30·0 days (Range: 11·0–67·0; interquartile ranges: 23·0–38·0) survivors, **whereas median time death 21·0 days**

consider reporting lag (maybe week, knows) deaths seeing probably attributed month ago, way 4th july. sources find state around 18.5-25 days. April people panic buying masks. Heck think people complaining masks sold people protesting masks.  Yet people walk around phone pocket location services day long.  counties pushing opening back one week like thatll make difference. gone week, right? /s Yep, bought April 2nd I'm liquidating back cash week. Wait Congress passes next bill think getting back in. Garbage in, garbage out. makes believe firmly China innocent one here? 

Innocent proven guilty. US record making false accusations. try keeping track it. evidence provide reason US one it, shouting air without single evidence? 

Did claim evidence? specifically said assume US one it. US history claiming countries something evil themselves. ""trick"" use predict future? worked well? 

1. US claims countries violates human rights? US violates human rights.
2. US claims countries threat democracy? US overthrows democracies.
3. US claims countries meddling country? US meddling countries.
4. US claims countries funding terrorists? US funding terrorists.
5. US claims countries spying? US largest spy network.
6. US claims countries backdoors products? US backdoors products.
7. US claims countries run concentration camps? US runs concentration camps.

It works amazingly well actually. try it. US masters projection. teacher friends family getting wills prepared schools forced open September.

i hope told completely insane, although always smart prepared general got assets. Smoking bad yes, millions people employed smoking companies? need jumpstart economy it’s right smoke, wants live past 80 anyway! /s *Alabama enters chat.* Hard drink beer eat stadium food mask on. What? idea trying get them? Florida got *voted* for. Omgosh needed this, Gods work can't ask Trump anything. Reciprocating would sign weakness. need something gives power you. gives you, loses power you. it’s patriotic wear mask. He’s come long way, baby! Well actually accurately is, “Houston, we’ve problem here”. know problem .... wear mask! Lol, dont realize arrogant us americans you? think Texas (by Texas mean charge state actually run things) actually take seriously now? Also diamond tiara doesn’t hurt. judge Hidalgo County, TX enacted Stay Home order state (IIRC) fighting it.  Its. Despicable. Even though median age dropping There's going alot angry karens ""I swear im 2 I'm tall age"" Cue conspiracy hospitals getting crazy rich classifying deaths COVID bill more.  Lol think actually “simple” suppose probably right, papers point people claiming \~The Answer\~ better. I'm danged worried timeline. :( Yea similar situation, shit real. playing home, 16 million 0.2% entire global population humanity. happy death cultists getting want? Seems like win-win, tbh. really kills asians, actually “can’t happen don’t eat bats government won’t cover coronavirus.”

Well first part true. second part...LOL. incredibly naive person would believed that. People already voluntarily tracking phones apps them. sub dermal tracker would extremely expensive implement en masse people already paying track themselves. used median average. That's median works people dying young influence median much influence mean. That's right compromise everyone's safety hours one asshole. I'd tell choose pushed plane put mask fat face. Ugh real. wanted hear something together high school fuckin musical right Disney+ tune tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

5 ways get parents wear masks. I'll happily okay l play feelings. Bought Ford stock April 2nd. Retirement account hundred thousand since then.  Maybe little, little North Carolina going know. guarantee media blame Trump getting 200 million China get rid well? biggest problem politicians getting paid big companies force people wear face masks companies get sales. Politicians care health well being. getting paid suffering. several articles months ago taken less 2 days. Thats face masks forced. Greedy polititians make quick buck. Succinctly put, kudos! It’s game 1percent correct. possible stringing together whatever phrases pop head. clear history rambling nonsensically point clear thesis. Hard know him. competent individual, might better idea based context might expect continuity instead random, disconnected ridiculousness. There's definitely huge change even last 5-10 years. Even driving around, rarely see people smoking cars. I'm sure biggest factor price hikes. cost quitting currently. Also, smoke menthols area made really difficult get (they sold smoke shops liquor stores, close around 10pm me). something fully supported, even though directly inconvenienced me. made cut back lot, made easier quit now. 

Interestingly, smoking found pretty strong inverse correlation mortality covid-19. good reason take smoking, even continue, I'm interested see studies it. crazy 500 cases went full lockdown. again, controlling virus country populated India next impossible. 

The silver lining death rate still quite low. (Chuckles) ""im danger"" managers insist employees physically there? heard one. one comment. need work home? Somebody making us go office. 

Maybe Facebook type. soon Trump abandons DeSantis? Never ceases amaze whipped governors Trump turn back second need be. watch he'll DeSantis Abbott like Kemp. Wait.. fans?? found multiple people previous department got sick coming contact Covid managers kept secret silently sent home. livid got insider info Willfully ignorant. came say well. many problems ""Experiment"" touted sort proof. Sounds like need wear masks day. wear one every day every shift even pandemic. People saying masks effect breathing stupidly ignorant refuse wear one reduce risk covid. Same. know someone Navy “worked” nurse. said wearing mask destroys immune system. asked possible went tangent made zero sense.... Apparently boss called office tell demotion he'll getting downstairs office. So- long til available public? Blowing Jesus! Cultists listen facts. makes think nations take you? many incidents talking here... 2 dozen, maybe 100 (if generous)? many people died severly sick catching Covid public places? 130,000 dead, probably 500,000 hospitalized ... OP idiot Depending live... online dating... meeting somewhere outside walk maintaining distance, masks... don’t total hermit. 

And meet someone trust also isolated transition isolating together. 

Depending middle hotspot pick timing. Look new case death graphs day; seeing deaths rising pace new cases 3 weeks ago. may see 1,000 new deaths per day month so, certainly keep rising. could wrong, I'm basing huge rise cases, plus lag time cases detected deaths. sure would nice contained like SARS. real kicker next time happens, won’t learned anything definitely won’t anti-pandemic protocols. 

Please prove wrong good point... biggest covid risk may parking lot tail gating said schools in-person, I've said least twice think *not* traditional. But, means continue false assumption.

Where disagree seem feel like teachers incapable enforcing dress code. Yes, students violate right now.... students get sent home. hard I'm sure everyone suddenly super convinced be. keep up, started exercising well feel best felt long time. Wear 😷   interested martyring due idiocy American society.

100%. see lot comments posts get negative reactions suggest people wear masks acted generally irresponsibly become less priority (to clear, saying treatment, talking prioritization) treatment inadvertently exposed. People quick point 'we Chinese social currency system' 'Hippocratic oath.' I'm health care provider and, would mind that. good thing is, hypothetical exercise reality.

I also life family. want sacrifice health mental health people love detrimentally affected this. sign suffer hands ignorance stupidity. honest, enough daily basis prior COVID19. one need top it. flat care. people wearing masks, fewer cases huge initial viral loads. Sick people isolating opposed going work super sick giving coworkers super-dose death 200 coughs 4 feet across conference table.

Earlier treatment too. Idk remedial people around pneumonia hospitals saying covid related extra money... main two excuses hear. marinate line instantly made think OutKast assumed ATL May wound O.K. Yup every troll response ever citation case numbers Reddit couple weeks ago. 

Today they've given argument, moved onto variation ""people die, is, live it"" hopeful vaccines take years months. Rushing vaccine good practice. I'm pro-vaccine I'm taking anything people huge financial interest rushing market.  Retail workers many stores can't even stop people stealing shit store. huge liability company. Even training tell hero getting robbed. high end clothing stores, there's word it- people come grab shit go. employees instructed engage. 

Because worth it.

With masks, ask wear mask must leave, circumstances try engage physically blocking path arguing trying use kind force. call police person leave that's it. Unless security.

I want everyone wear mask. worked retail long time. job description include possibly catching Covid enforcing law. understand important mask. retail workers enforce, I'm sorry.

Let's put way. someone tried come store pants, would do? ""Sir need wear pants,"" he's like ""no fuck you, freedom"" really call security cops. End story. type cell HIV attacks? 1/50 way there. at, 49 governors? Thank you! never thought that, you’ve said it, don’t know didn’t occur me!!

Currently stopped night. Lady walked store wearing mask asked needed wear one. clerk said state mandade they're enforcing it. pulled mask said ""oh thank God"".

The town I'm Ontario made requirement since April. get store without mask.

Here Ohio? signs say required. maybe quarter customers wearing one. Sticks q tips bat ass discover deadly viruses could be. Discovered virus bad go away, Thanks ass digging. Walks away hero. Correct thank governor locking down. 

Most people Keys older 30 40 think, blame one bit hiding right now.  seems like good idea ATM would go finding out? don’t family could ask. thankful

 cumulative total 15,075,369 samples tested 22 July 2020.

 Number samples 350,823 tested 22 July 2020. Would agree give guns, hunting rifles; also removed guns law enforcement exception extreme situations places (federal banks such)? smoking god given right American s/  hurt, trust guy knows. pretty much across NE. Things back normal, we're enjoying benefits watching four horsemen trotting streets neighbors fuckwits. far year going, that's huge win.  seen who's charge? shit wont change anytime soon. Yeah, know tons people north Texas #provirus. Right, 2, mom live friend got kicked suddenly. think karma princess’ wedding didn’t work. Let’s forget dad shameless prince Andrew. Ya going there.

Kids can’t catch spread it!!!!!!!!!!1111112 Yeah everytime think moving away northeast mind goes healthcare. I've literally never worry losing it.  Dude need better union. usa still country rooted slavery. People resources used. 

If work, longer resource expendable. Well let put way - picture rat hole uncovered plane looks phone visibly neither eating drinking, that's violation consequences. Even full duration flight, rules ""wear mask unless actively eating drinking consequences"" definitely proof Cruz airline nothing.

There definitive proof that. atleast wait til december 31st that? Michigan thankfully low deaths. Today 6. 

I remember week ago zero. good day.  I'm honestly indifferent discussion could statistic - like, they're trying benefit high death rates, trying research effects covid patients immunocompromised - even plain old hit car. states don’t want Americans states. Isn’t Hawaii barring people mainland? Well get sick kills someone know they'll probably continue giving shit...bunch selfish assholes.  care Mexicans Thats said. said guns right life people. Numbers getting really bad winter

Oh dont worry they´re going get really bad well that, give 7+30 days schools open. mean lightly, I'm critical care covid ward myself. Us old timers use bad humor defense mechanism.  conversation coworker. believes lying get Biden elected. even argue someone thinks nations doctors scientists conspiring get Trump kicked office?  Wow you’re actual trash human being. fun thing oaths is... really doctors take them. Nurses licensed, take oaths. act like hospitals randomly bill things OT money cure mental health problems deal with. children 2 exempt? scientific evidence suggest children 2 less likely infected covid 3 year olds? nothing source yet. What? someone asymptomatic still virus. virus causes blood clots (heart attack, brain damage, organ failure), lung damage die from.

If happens. died covid, lol. op but, seconds count(when trouble seconds away) cops minutes away.  words, NWO conspiracy nuts screaming since forever?  different hours day start None toba either. guys work dont believe exists. Hopefully hutterite colonies getting hit change minds (the one dude ex hutterite) we’re showing virus brave won’t give way life!

/s one ever claimed dude eating bat. Ever. Pandemics happen dude. 

I also again, would ***entire world*** purposely crash economies? far simple accept Trump awful leader? Every developed country figured COVID out. cases reported China? 9 America, 1 UK, 5 Russia, on. number infected people coming China? Look people said global. Others faked numbers caught lying. said wearing mask prevent getting virus yet box mask comes said protect covid. Remember flu? Yeah too. Covid flu give name. 2019 80,000 people US died flu whats count now? idea everything covid. Nov 4th know happen bad would feel covids numbers dropped date? Big mistake CCP always enemy. today got cough burning bunch records Texas embassy consulate, place used spy center. You’re sad excuse human being. Hope let Carry. takes one deranged customer end like dollar General security guard got killed Flint ""we made report numbers directly HHS instead CDC, fudge numbers"" rare age group, worried, get oximeter Amazon Ebay monitor yourself. fought hard sell beers, bad dead bodies littering street amount bitching moaning save economy pandemic. Yeah, I'm sure system working exactly intended. like 7,000+ americans die every day. guess states working together juke numbers. Impressive. guess Ohio verge bankruptcy people needing pay bills still 'supporting' consumer economy even though fiat economy could adjust production accordingly, yeet™ head Tucker “Fucker” Carlson’s ass fucks. Influenza free course. You’re sad excuse human being. think 30 states statewide mandate. Huge spike people 20-30 getting now. Good thing applauded people decided group protests global pandemic they’re saying lot old deaths added now, ignoring fact deaths missing weeks ago added, deaths higher sooner thought, also likely deaths missing current totals well added weeks now. rate. ended earlier possibility ending like New Zealand. us, community fucking stupid. 5% people masks believe virus hoax, 10% percent probably even more. why, godsake Republicans? Trump make wearing mask political statement fuel fire poor whites rhetoric spills misinformation. American society fucking stupid? sure rule .02% IFR certainty. 


 average year 37,000 deaths importantly flu multiple strain disease infect individual multiple times season. need 250 million people infected 0.02% IFR. Odd people vocally concerned society conditioned sheep ones believing repeating crap like that, seeing nothing wrong armed federal agents abducting people streets cities support current regime right election.   38 percent Democrats said considering leaving, compared 55 percent independents 71 percent Republicans. Similarly, characterizing “somewhat liberal” least likely say want go — fewer 4 10 considering 53 percent moderates, 66 percent “somewhat conservative,” 74 percent “very conservative” would like migrate. Political affiliation, fact, predictor wants go stay demographic information, race Que? migration bigger mythical 2018 caravan? Ain’t gonna happen. Partly broad mandate isn’t necessary since states bad Sun Belt; partly masks social distancing ease risk second wave; partly there’s getting first wave government fucking stupid eager watch us die tried bit...the patients ended ants crawling them.

But...but... daddy Trump said.. \#istandwiththatwoman  #biggretch mean 62 id give feel like I'm 30 now... exactly expecting- someone die front them? nursing home residents, article says Northern Arizona University opening two weeks? Canadian here, sure seems lot going Alaska... New Mexico fairly locked down. inside dining, masks required public, etc. figure math schools reopen. Wonder graph look like... Jesus, read.

The conspiracy theory hospitals get paid deaths, that’s supposedly report.

Your link says get paid PATIENTS. deaths. Good thing bar owners got sell couple extra beers. about, things shutdown. even live California? Still FREER day June

🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷


^^/s Wow people dropping like flies president say lowest death rate stated CFR IFR. bogus, confusing terms. I'm support him, conflicted early recommendations masks, even though save supply medical personnel. However lasting damage. usually hear argument people think democrats trying hurt Trumps re-election chances making exaggerating scale pandemic. I'm surprised admit it. Fucking insane times right? Lol. Canadian versions Karen Chad. Good luck. Stay safe... Governor Tate Reeves said doesn’t want shut anything down, may forced so, cases spiral. Forty percent patients ICU COVID-19, 30% one week ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm curious Governor considers cases spiraling. Yeah, no, valid question. suspect possible unlikely statistically. Viruses tend last long time non porous, cool surfaces, like stainless steel. tend decay rapidly food, understand, virus particles food aerosolized way sneeze would. rudimentary understanding cousin virologist basically told us take delivery fine, avoid restaurants like plague, pun intended. Hospitals **do not** get money Covid deaths. all.
 
They get reimbursed Medicare treatment living Covid patients. Surf's up? build DIY small coffins.

I see YouTube videos now. many 9/11s take take seriously? live congressman useless I’ve “voting out” years lol mean...do even really NEED Kansas?  Trump isn’t anything. hits minorities harder. Free blue vote culling. half time cases. New York already shut started putting numbers up. 

If going rely numbers April probably look case lag see bad really is. Lol though? Also cases continue flatline testing goes say? Perhaps virus serious? must masks social distancing slowing spread despite news Reddit claiming Americans irresponsible! hATe amErICa?!?

Oh Canadian. Carry on. argument. one country managed sixth entire planet's deaths barely twenty-fifth population? one keeps coming like whack-a-mole.  What? I’m saying fucking thing are. Hospitals rightly get money COVID patients treatment. Idiots think evil doctors lying money. Doctors immuned well: stupid, even experts. Multigenerational families, frontline workers, access unemployment money due short term gigs need harms way live... many situations get killed kill loved ones. pretty obviously tried claim something wasn’t relevant.

Sure get paid money patients. incentive over-report confirmed cases need care.

There incentive over-report deaths....which literally conspiracy theory.

You provide evidence want payments patients, nothing subject hand: dead bodies.  deaths started increasing 26 days cases did. states took bit longer (e.g. Georgia). Basically, always going look like death rate slowing data recent weeks always going incomplete. takes time officially report count deaths. see explanation scroll bottom page linked. none. evidence actually suggests reporting.
 
Certain people confusing CARES act providing Medicare funding **treatment** Covid patients macabre notion hospitals billing code “Deaths; Covid”. 2020: *did u say sumthin* Yes. young people getting sick although fewer die proportionately older people, younger deaths. share feeling.  mom, keeps asking go vacation spots beaches overweight chain smoker. Oh works hospital too. Don’t worry guys, Rand Paul says need optimism. Alright, inherently inaccurate reality. 

You use see projected deaths, get that, 2.7% still bogus. funny guy! Nope, absolutely right. need real security person front, acting ""door greeter"". minimum wage position. Yes, cost money.

Let's see deal overwhelming response. need stand say ENOUGH ENOUGH. causing death mayhem. store managers given authority corporate say ""Behave leave.""... supposed learn grade school. can't behave society, belong it. Imagine Republicans resort voter suppression. Hope they'll half vocal secret police show.  It’s pence’s home state really believe Biden would fumble badly, Obama would either. truly difficult listen experts implement standard, national plan. suppose, based downvotes, everyone New England callously cavalier it, go without masks, party hard bad Texas Florida right now.

Nobody saying idiot, absolute moron. Everyone wearing mask, anybody tries party called stupid fuckhead immediately, complaining downvotes reddit pathetic thing ever. idiot.  would end game? see motive possible.  NYC desperately afraid worked fucking asses prevent.

They fucking threw everything needed bed- got one. needed vent, got one.

They manned fuck got job done.

I shocked disgusted boisterous bullshit quite frankly- laziness Texas Florida leadership put doctors shitty position. admit there's problem? Lol time 1 100, gonna keep trickling everyone everyone watches twiddling thumbs, grand. 2.7% best case scenario wildly inaccurate measuring system? 

Unless know cases, 2.7% still matter. 2.7% (best case known scenario) would way lower 2.7%. Exactly, everyone’s immune system different cannot fully clear virus provide protection, isolated questions sign everyone go No, fucking idiot, forget breathe stupidity fucking mask No, did. Businesses refuse service customers harm staff others.  Exactly. huge problem perverse incentives. cant control pandemic, system actively discourages large percentages population seeking help need it. Yup, Christ-like. 

It's like, ""Christ!"" Everyone retirement plan mark market 9:18 (activated fever system) could mean non-symptomatic spreaders would start getting fever given beta interferon would easier detect infected people get money covid patients. should. Virtually data says deaths underreported showing people excess death data quickly prove 😂  makes sense, doesn’t it?
 
Don’t think highly infectious patient requires specialized breathing device might little costly regular patient? Sounds like dear daddy too. Almost 70 years old, smokes, previous heart attacks, meds, recovering cancer patient.... thinks he's invincible.

I refuse even visit I'm trying make sure way could harm him, since can't see risk. understand go see him. thinks ""everyone else"" that's risk. Dad - trying *help you,* reject you! Bye ‘Personnel’ also time develop vaccine effectively halved time frame said March. Something tells me, much line, production going sped up.

And one thing US good it, it’s hurling money problems. Congratulations, you’re armed. Put mask leave, you’re welcome here. people detaching situation. covid death happens next response ""that person old"" ""they comorbidity"". uncomfortable people think could happen someone know. need practice stick handling, door holding, incessantly saying 'thank you', enjoying ketchup chips putting maple syrup on/in _everything_ including water Coke (yes, thing).

This test. mystery. New England effectively shut economy. That’s went down. really got area shutdown, paid six week price. mean probably national security issues admitting overrun infections. chaos would time internal dissidents gain traction potentially external powers make moves you. It’s country wants honestly report situation. wish could. Id willing self isolate good computer internet connection ever many days want. idiot friend say something like dude skiing covid got decapitated counted covid death. Lol! Eventually everyone die number go down!!! Can’t tell trump makes shit goes? understand sentiment completely  don’t think understand saying. Look downvotes. You’re making strong case. Many ventilators soon enough, direct consequence actions. It’ll different sound. I've already seen trend people saying this... heard today lunch. Come US! hit 2000!! it!!! proved recently? Could troll political opponent posting it, fan (I'm Brit even know side he's on) weighing alternatives. decision destroy economy rest doorstep anyone except administration. Multiple countries decided complete shutdown supported businesses workers providing rent wages shutdown. US administration decided go another direction. hybrid system none successful countries did. PPP, keeping business open, closed, locking completely, locking 3 week only. One county open, another open. bad tactic.

Is worth it? greater good whole country absolutely. But, worth March April, point US lost battle war. chance, ruined it. Every decision made point consequence bad decisions country made March April. schools open? chance. Blame March April. NFL? ya right. Blame March April. list goes on.

I agree hostility grow get worse unless make one good decision shut completely. But, won't. people fed March April barely even sacrificed anything. disagree hostility, believe point countries succeeded getting lives not. one blame administration ourselves.

Science beliefs

Science vocal minority

Science angry Karens outdoors can't distance way using public transportation/ride share. literally believe hospitals get money Covid deaths.  flu cause ton different ailments persist entire life. black white. Exceptions made medical purposes, strenuous physical activity, eating, drinking.

Seems like rather large loophole. stop confusing people. Fact is, case someone recovered later become infectious observed confirmed. 

You see, science theory.  science, believe theories predict explain observe. observation, science. information did? Kept clas sizes same, installed/ instilled, etc. forgotten guess know who's advising Mitch McConnell bill. get boosters. It’s rocket science. Lol, know Googling names never occurred me. search articles. :/

Anyway, definitely right. Bare fuckery 💀. Sorry, thought we're masturbating. bad. I'll get next time. Cross-immunity may played role there. friend likely exposed coronaviruses point life, may bolstering immune response covid-19.  live Arizona step front door see stupid things Facebook. made really big, really false claim vaccines. vaccine anyone talking ready soon Oxford’s started trials, phase 3 trials seeing promising results first two phases.

We mass producing vaccine right now, cost, cut production time. timeline gets sped up, skipping testing. Please stop spreading blatantly false information. mean... long I’m vaccinated trust vaccine feel confident. long I’m immune doesn’t matter people aren’t. Whos sick winning?  strain hit Italy like SARS 1.0 SARS 2.0 respect. I'm north central OH. know enforced. I've masking since mid March I'm puppet apparently. (I know anti maskers think really.) It’s America probably lot. cancer researcher MD aiming oncologist, agree. welcome fast food open arms absolutely NOTHING provide poor families sources healthy nutrition food deserts.

The country whole lot nothing needy; that's systemic issue less cultural one. people aware obesity bad, people want fat, people want healthy; gave everyone personal chef, private trainer, nutritionist, likely see meaningful changes American health lifestyles.

Meanwhile, people can't even bare minimum wearing mask staying home. Almost everyone recognizes cancer real, want cancer. sizeable portion population *doesn't even think COVID-19 can't even bother tax sources unhealthy nutrition even though places enormous burden healthcare system basically transfers cost directly American people.

Taxing unhealthy food *terrible* solution reducing obesity; make cost food inaccessible people already struggling poverty. Sure, might put someone upsizing 20 oz soft drink half gallon, processed foods cuisine-of-choice poor people easy, accessible, affordable. Making cost food, *already* prohibitively expensive, even *more* costly like giant middle finger poor People know people who've died cancer/heart disease lifetime 80 million deaths cancer/heart disease. COVID reach even developed new tradition coughing other's mouths every morning work.

Great, addition number tragic deaths cancer heart disease, let's throw top hundreds thousands preventable deaths. I'm really clear argument ""heart disease cancer really bad."" mean, yeah, nearly respiratory viruses, even second infection occurs, often thwarted prior symptoms body able mount response much quickly.

Sure, understand adaptive immunity works. We've already seen indication people infected previously coronaviruses may level defense COVID-19. However, we've also seen indications people may genetic predisposition vulnerable COVID-19; people reinfected ""common cold"" coronaviruses exhibit equally severe symptoms reinfection.

Furthermore, COVID-19 may similar SARS-CoV-1 lack memory B cells; extent memory cells would effective combating reinfection unknown, especially older populations. That's whole point: make inferences without concrete data. even solid data reinfections SARS-CoV-1, far I'm aware. little fall back Maybe whataboutism, also realism. COVID scary people new, point deadly we've still got much bigger wolf barn, dude sticking around year year. perspective death risk insanely skewed right now. 60 gained weight gotten less healthy quarantining, increased chance death significantly would getting COVID.

It's scary 150,000 people died far others may suffering chronic disability result??? Like, I'm lowly biochem grad, chronic illness, I'm lowly biochem grad *because* -- higher academia never accessible like healthy people.

So might look numbers say ""But many people suffered died this!"" I'm living, breathing person side: someone who, statistically, *should* healthy able-bodied, isn't, disease people age rarely suffer from. might numbers you, numbers people died, lost family members, suffering poor quality life months getting Try cancer researcher pinches pennies every study barely gets paid enough live, hear people say treat cancer/heart disease ""gravity deserves."" allocated $6 billion NCI last year, Trump even tried cut that.

I mean callous, like... get line, dude. Countless valuable programs stifled cut feed military industrial complex line pockets rich greedy. unique What's unfathomable warped everyone's perspective virus is. Yes, something it. Socially distance possible. Wear mask. Cut unnecessary trips. see elderly parents. way people carry talking maim life, make infertile, kill 10 million people, etc... little-to-no evidence that.

k know make understand people died, really matter 300 million people die heart attack tomorrow, minimize value meaning 150,000 died far COVID-19. seem really pressed like, think time place it, really. Try conversation someone NYC let know goes. describing strange all. I've read somewhere probability transmitting coronavirus family member around 15-30%, mistaken. depends country. UK anyone covid die counted covid death, even final straw. I've seen countries suspiciously high pneumonia death rates. Tradidutonally UK ever gets last, cant speak places add mess whole situation. Excess mortality key future evaluate stuff like fan exotic dancers eating car Vivid Gentleman's Club probably kind pandemic paradise  Yup, it’s Burger King, there’s dancing involved.

There much wrong 2020 Lots possibilities:

1. Younger population getting virus. fact.

2. Summertime, vit D, better response.

3. Outside infections, smaller viral initial load.

4. Virus may mutated. Presidential Sharpie  Obviously point win reelection -- ""leading"" done donors. America.  Nope, recall massacre, violent protest end continued chinas path prosperity, always funny angry westerners want get mad behalf we, ppl lived there, happy govt Really? come current government supports whine anything crisis?

Weeeh, freedom, wear masks. Ohhh, freedom, cannot mandata masks. Cut funding. Slow testing. Etc. ?

Climate change? Weeeeh, inconvenience? money? change, please.

Really, disagree view. Lmao real?

Low estimates flu deaths last year 34k, 6x deadlier would 204,000 deaths year equally contagious. Problem covid 2-3x contagious really we're looking 400-600k deaths per year nothing. 

Idk say half million deaths per year bad... dunno, season 7 pretty toss well.  new normal 😂 vote casual sloppy salute. “...But must say based Europe whole debate politicization mask issue, (it) becoming part U.S. culture wars, pretty surreal observe...”

Yeah, it’s pretty surreal US too. SMH would people take news reason stop wearing mask.... Theoretically, deadly virus spreads, weaker strains spread faster, since morbid patients cannot successfully spread disease well healthier, mobile infected carriers. happens time, virus theoretically spread weaker strains prolifically.


HOWEVER, strain hit Milan, Italy originally fashion show visitors Wuhan, deadly strain spread quickly effectively. ways, COVID breaking rules. ways, like California strains began November/December, may following typical viral model rules.

I want summarize saying advocating spreading disease. must remember point social distancing mask wearing flatten curve. promote spread weaker strains passively testing symptomatic individuals, however trying prevent spread virus overall order minimize morbidity, mortality, morale medical community suffering past 4 months dealing poor decision-making politicians. person penalty swears written affidavit

I'm explaining hospital reimbursement works Covid. that's irrelevant claim hospitals receive money Covid deaths. prefer fight ignorance facts opposed dismissing hand. 

The assumption hospitals get lump sum money covid death ridiculous especially since technically again, saying lie wrong someone easily fact check reputable sources. Explaining irrelevant going powerful argument. italicized relevant parts.

Every fact checker confirmed claim least partially true reasons cited. mostly draw [Kaiser project much hospitals would get paid federal government treating uninsured patients, look payments admissions similar conditions. less severe hospitalizations, use average Medicare payment respiratory infections inflammations major comorbidities complications 2017, $13,297. severe hospitalizations, use average Medicare payment respiratory system diagnosis ventilator support greater 96 hours, $40,218. *Each average payments increased 20% account add-on Medicare inpatient reimbursement patients COVID-19 included CARES  accounting 20% add on, *Medicare payments about* [*half private insurers *on average diagnoses.* absence new proposed policy, many uninsured would typically billed based hospital charges, undiscounted “list prices” care typically much higher even private insurance  great.

Second wave probably happen around winter alot countries. countries even first wave. US one never really got first wave slight dip went straight back up. India etc never first wave tbh really first wave. Europe etc yh around winter. 

Providing testing keep US likely first country reach 100k daily cases. 7 day moving average already around 70k. mean like end date tho That’s sad, could worse. Yeah, really compare total number deaths 2020 total number deaths average year. far numbers 2020 huge compared first half average year. would do? we'd IRL friends.  different Tennessee.  One night party stupid decision cause permanent damage.

How typical.

Just like drunk driver drove family 3.


Just like surgeon needed fix marijuana call surgery.


Just like stupid kids NEED party.


No self control. get additional money covid patients patient dies (from covid issue) death listed covid death. see issue don’t you?  logical. You’re working like minds. Trump told protest's best case scenario constrained testing right it’s still enormously better back March ‘true’ CFR would much lower. 

For fuck sake. people fucking wore masks stayed home - we’d done already. Instead get fucking freezer trucks ready.  think like 14 days, 3 days symptoms.  That's assuming rate holds. falling pretty consistently. Alaska already that. I'm surprised southwest serving anything 
Of course always bring stuff Agreed, Im skipping fall semester concern. going set education back safety important. Sadly Purdue wants full tuition online program thats option either. ""You cant judge man actions, words beliefs""!

 Well wtf supposed judge on? Living name love guns too. remember country readily available. replaced one tyrannical government new one. History way repeating itself. thinking selfish minds. would do.. Thoughts prayers course. Can't go wrong classics.  10 years old, points they're beholden name suppose possible could crazy conservative station manager wants run stuff right-wing slant, seems like much comes even farther chain nowadays (e.g. many stations across country similar logos, website content, national/international news stories, etc.).

Anecdotally, three main news networks town (Fox, NBC, CBS) pretty centrist comes political stuff; ABC affiliate owned Sinclair news (though tried show time ago seemed actual homage Colbert Report, local guy reputation saying stupid things). MEANWHILE HARRISBURG PA inbred imbeciles. Gotta love ""large crowd"" lmao. Damn near many Trump's inauguration reckon! Fuck Pennsyltuckians. currently considering quitting teaching last possible moment. idea already. Anyone half brain knows daily reported cases, anything, way LOWER actual case count. So: no. phucking shit, I've saying months. still dealing testing debacle 4 months in, makes anyone think average person see shot 6 months? claim deaths closure. Like people going checkups, people...  Starving? dunno, argument work.  hear lot also. usually people get ""breaking news"" Facebook Memes.

Amazing fast Facebook went good way share pics grandma militarized propaganda disinformation site. Jesus thats cry help. then? ""BeCaUsE tEsTiNG mORe"" - them, probably 1000 per day despite measures we're taking. taking many measures, would much, much worse. taken seriously beginning could control economy could essentially back normal. Every single person dies reason, test positive, listed coronavirus death. everyone knowledge China. Great yet? OpEn ScHoOlS could ask spouse his. might eligible citizenship someplace.

But truly family ask history. might DNA test see gives results.

I know Ireland relatively easy get. friend mine years ago fun. Youre assuming visiting selfless

Maybe uses free meals laundry Hes arguing bad faith Ooh think they’ll ever mention leader PA department health removing mother nursing home put plan action? doubt Might want hand red bulls prison guards. #this deaths, friend  obviously plot world crab people.... don’t understand this. seems like California place world widespread mask use still struggling greatly virus. Take county live in, masks first required April daily case totals, well 100, hit record 279 today. Literally everyone wears because:

1. It’s required
2. care others
3. hate Trump Trump said to
4. Everyone else would stick like sore thumb didn’t.

I know anti-maskers Orange county, really doubt they’re representative state whole. California issued statewide mask mandate June 18th shouldn’t still setting case records. immediately. AKA started caring started affecting rich people. Meanwhile read GOP Senator refer new (weak) stimulus proposal ""I think agreement reflects priorities, back school, back child care, back work."" damn joke. Priorities clearly reflect country's COVID-19 numbers. hypothetical young adults told Spring Break. Lol, Coronavirus *a* serious problem. point internment camps? American border detention centers.

The detention centers US bad, delusional think they're bad what's happening secret police? Portland federal police.  Korean starvation? American poverty food shortage 

Lol, give break. funding terror cells. American intervention central south America.

If referring CIA's use covert ops 80s, bad, also funding terrorism throughout many places throughout world day. one said US blind belief American dream delusional makes part problem.

You keep talking like know anything me, clearly don't. delusional. babbling. mysteriously drop, took weeks slowly drop. ""baby"" best man wedding. get ""kicked out"" all... father Princess Beatrice valued enough include 16-person lockdown wedding. Numbers go Isn’t like screen...? doesn’t screen keep flies mosquitos...? 🏅Props keeping downvoted misconceptions posted deleting them. think cool people see others change minds misconceptions corrected.

Also, brain melting advertisements assaults frayed attention span reading them.

Writing letters bad either. Helps learn express thoughts confident civilized way. also encourage literally kind art.

Basically, know insanely boomer take, think electronics (phones, PCs, TVs mostly) really fried people's brains. Whenever get offline healthier, sometimes learn something, morale always improves. heard COVID disproportionately killing PoC decided...well...maybe COVID ain't bad all... want quality people here. People can't even bothered fill paper people pay taxes support government. become serfs can't vote get deported. Illegal immigration worst immigrants, arguing  mainly Rio Grand Valley struggling now, mostly shithole even best valley, really North Mexico Texas

the person saying shit probably californian expat; act/behave like especially stupid texan local. even indoor dining, max capacity.

Miss watering hole, understand 😭 ""It's late anything now"" They'll say months ago, recently reclassified covid dedths. Yeah know. Russia China propaganda. Biden gets intl reports right now. people gang 8 already told media they're actively interfering election again.

They sides. looked days ago. flu killed, max, 62K people 2019-2020 flu season.
Covid killed 140K+ 4 months. 

Not flu. uh change it.. Never started. side till ended that. Obviously big brain Brad know happened him. ""i know anybody died"" part probably due testing. They're testing 300k 400k day roughly much size population consider US used test much day. It’s sad tribalistic politics US. It’s like football - people aren’t going stop cheering favorite team QB racist, idiotic, self-absorbed asshole. long gets “wins”... Nowhere send patients. Texas overflowing cases, many regions well capacity. counties also crisis care active pending. ain't peak Texas ain't going anytime soon.

Oh no, no...that'll right around school opening up... can’t wait unemployment benefits end throw limited job market risk numbers getting worse :) Mmmhhh starting think numbers fake  impressive! 1200 bed hospital like 10 days? real hospital, tents. I've following daily cases spiked Wuhan. Seems like forever ago. though? Who/what group people funds pay *every single hospital US* without single person coming forward credible proof? We’re talking billions dollars, probably more, something gives benefit anyone. 

It can’t government trump’s draining swamp, can’t capitalist lockdown cripples sales, who’s left?

Or one theories doesn’t backing soon point they’ll whip different conspiracy theory defends former one? It’s vicious cycle made worse fact people fall propagate typically awful *actual* research, i.e. finding sources websites without ties nazism, bonus points site’s since election cycle

Oh yeah, forgot mention I’m Canada recently numbers started rising (we’re reopening too, much slower), guess mystery entity paying hospitals around world Im looking spice things mrs wondering Canadian Health Agency recommended beginners light bondage cosplay? Update: man keeps hitting self face continues bleed nose Glory holes prevent covid transmission, 

Unfortunately catch every std available.  TBF *intent* AO, though real intent pretty vile itself. 

Ranch Hand stopped research pointing evidence TCDD contamination started appearing (though know whether coincidental, whether army knew beforehand stopped started becoming public). 

The US certainly didn’t protect people AO / TCDD. Indieana.

Because they're mainstream Indiana. Um, shopping again. Bye, Lowe's! agree damage fact done it. won’t say you’re wrong there. conflict people lacking common sense point European countries let leave house buy food, original comment advocated non exceptions lockdown could leave get food. fact could leave house buy food stemmed food shortage hell even Australia lockdown food shortages meat produce several weeks. putting overheating (since mask literally additional clothing area body lose ton heat through) + humid air inside it, I’m sure that’s correct. assumed similar phenomenon trying run really hot/humid weather always makes feel breathless hell. Technically also starts giving less shit work starts that's semantics ;) money laundries. Low wages MS blessing curse. ""only"" making $50k year GM major restaurant there. nice new leased car every 2 years, nice house, money bank. left second brick window. non Trump following real issue socially. Herpes also virus. someone it, stays body lives forever, anytime get little run stressed-out they're going outbreak. Maybe every time big event coming (school pictures, job interview, big date) going get cold sore. rest life. get weeks. know around years, studied medically years.

I got herpes 1 (ie cold sores) kid. I'm middle aged, every time get stressed tired - bam - come f*@ cold sores. even think said? Bluetooth know contagious unless check Thanks asking questions open learning adjusting new information that’s presented you!  dad says need get better jobs offer great healthcare. can't poors get better jobs money like rest son, there's always gonna winners losers, make sure we're winners.

Wow thanks dad, like Supply Side Jesus taught us.  ~~attacked~~ criticised prez time

Occam’s Razor would suggest it’s likely he’s things worthy criticism whole world get him. Lets imagine 2 strains.

1 really contagious: A

1 less contagious: B

Both competing keep existing, whichever infects first chances keep alive.

When lockdowns started B started fade wasnt effective. able take advantage evolution.

So natural selection process actions helped damaged B. Gladly differences aware off. Chinese consulate burning document Houston maybe take spot There's another way look statistics.

Death certificates filed last year point versus year. there's reason change stable environment. Y'all missing point completely.. 200k probably I've seen check in? 4.9 million that's low figure opinion.

And checking makes fucking app work surely?? know contact someone who's symptoms? Well click feckin app. yeah check-ins important part. makes ""contact tracing part work"" whole idea fantastic nation extremely stupid lazy comes this.

Since Monday alone I've get shopping atleast quarter half shoppers Dublin wearing masks, people literally regard distance personal space. exceptions lockdown. original comment advocating exceptions, changed exceptions showed evidence countries lockdowns exceptions like somehow refuted point instead making completely different point. great again?   Eh fuck dude, let's go bowling deaths, nothing tests  Good. doctor, thinking get chickenpox vaccine body would fight virus attempt quicker least prevent getting significant foothold re-emerge shingles later life 🤔

Probably question science subreddit. American agree. Trump reelected hope us. Thats weak argument. US 33 citizens per km² EU 102 citizens per km². risk getting infected much higher densly poppulated areas. qualifications say virus cannot airborne? Astonishment would imply outcome way unexpected. original comment 3 week lockdown leaving reason. None countries that. still essential workers, leaving food, etc. country put house 3 weeks without letting reason. Please learn read. shit huh? forget many americans would sell families slavery precious wrong government told to. Lots authoritarian boot lickers here. disease point. knew somebody use EZPass facebook want movements tracked.... used instagram &amp; GPS phone constantly. credit cards.

Also tried convince C19 hoax *while terribly ill C19*. blocked him. That's shame, thought power Christ would compelled virus away.   - least opinion - right. 

We fucked first response quite bad. ""lucky"" so, Italy already people dieing Corona overrun hospitals. 

So government finally took actions population resisting follow already took precautions. 

On hand: US saw images overrun hospitals well. know warning sign them, too. China can't ban people fast enough. hope detain coming commenting wrong thing. think we’ll start seeing “parking lot triage”? problem wearing mask going outside everyday activities.

The time find harder breathe I'm biking/running.

At first fine found short breathing lightheaded, kinda scary first tbh nothing that. Taking rest minutes starts noticing hepls though. Like many deaths tragic avoidable.

Americans wake malice contempt masters treat with? finally raise - *together* - set things straight? (One of) main point(s) flattening curve that, beyond point vaccine discovered (assuming vaccine discovered) cases drop dramatically thereafter. 

Also, going talking statistics, I'm sure use ""the narrative"" evidence. California started good highest number cases one gives fuck anymore Newsom never anything like this. get medal? 

We need medal! Best Covid 2020! Lol what? get $260 week state UI(less actually, taxes), making ~$950/week prepandemic. exactly getting paid $10 hour state? I'd getting $360/week plan. would fail pay rent October, family would living car December eviction process dragged maximum. Might able push January selling possessions. 

This shit fucking plan. wonder people continue banned pandemic over, Delta shred list? odd. almost novel people feel bad really are, especially oxygen levels realizing serious is. got test result back got antibodies, celebrate?  thought blow apartment first? Many European countries way nobody starved here. secret ingredient common sense: course could still go grocery store, wear mask. people tested positive stay strict home quarantine. government provided food necessities. 

With know now, probably even enough wear mask indoors times avoid large events / crowds. Outdoor activities seem large problem masks help lot first thought. hard!  RemindMe! August 30 thought fear kids would die (because kids basically die this), instead would take virus home grandparents actually die this? allowed eat drink plant? Every hospital work hundreds millions red.... Like said, damage done. avid anti maskers probably care says, there's gotta people felt fooled. cannot 100% fault. adapted life death situation. yet another excuse keep money flowing. know viruses "" Get Covid Again? It’s Unlikely"" Experts Say she’s fat sooner American's going can't pay debts, bills rent since jobs opened back closing back again. ""This YT video shows empty hospital"" 

its fake reeee (grunts intelectual supremacy) OP suggested “full no-holds-barred mega lockdown absolutely everyone ~3 weeks”, I’m arguing against. Maybe misunderstood you, arguing something different? Unfortunately comment says talking flu... corona.  6k people Indoors vs. 1-3k *outdoors* Pfft. Typical liberal differences. first thinking someone wrong link buffer... awesome.

It starts, *“At YouPorn, highly value importance considerate sexual exploration release daily lives, even COVID-19,” letter begins.* 

and slowly builds climax... delegating better word? impression central gov power whatever wants, even always so. Case point - central gov fired several high level characters Hubei gov? actually posted story regarding forum, one. ask anyone says means get flu shot year prevent deaths anyone could transmit too. far denier relatives fans flu shots despite dangerous opinion. would funny potentially deadly year US dual wave flu + covid whether severly sick flu get damn time. remember reading early China got much likely end ICU covid19 Oh, said 15 cases. 

I know NZ nearly double amount cases, assumed there, since best...

But since country better NZ, let know how. There's way know intentional really was. course Swedish government claim everything went planned turns Sweden comes looking better countries. claim would fine opposition turns mistake.

What know, however, Sweden plan action place case pandemic sold national stockpiles 90's.

tl;dr: Even Sweden wanted act harder, resources so, plans go it. whole situation unusual. really think someday, someone's death's cause would little mask! Goddamn. That's like 9/11 every single day, weeks. expert public health realise people avoid contact much possible highly contagious disease spreading population. 

If possible someone WFH that's be. Anything else pure malice. :) ...an angel death drink still don’t understand UK. gather disaster. still cases deaths declining? Typical uneducated arrogant American. Guess settles guys, pandemic over. guy nurse talked said it’s cool. Carrots sticks basically. 'glory' empire like robbing murdering neighbours house D:
Yeah, may fanciest TV now, still got Jimmy's blood cracks.

Would like build new glory better moral premise please, sure that's likely PM... Therapeutics certainly improve overall outcomes COVID patients (although 80 crowd seems vulnerable may benefit much there).

Vaccines? Probably 3-4 years marketability - basis timeline.

And yeah, flatten curve herd immunity tactic - thats goal along. comply flush tear gas trained alligators. right. unable effectively fight back. course will. might yet seeing death fallout 4th July idiocy, we've definitely seen/seeing case spike it. know follows couple weeks case spike - bunch deaths.  air droplets second biggest vector coronavirus contaminated surfaces like handrails, doorknobs items handle store...

What effectively saying ok contaminating handrails, doorknobs items handle store.

Not mention walk past child spraying coronavirus. 

Just advice says get one without valve everyone followed advice rather thinking know best America would get control 3M making many masks can, selling prices significantly higher pandemic started.  cost labor increased, paying lots overtime. cost materials increased, buy get, instead buying low-cost sellers. Overall, think 3M exhibiting good, ethical, corporate citizenship. Thank clear analysis going :( Heck, we've got $2k municipal fine paper here, even cops seldom wear masks, municipal court records show **0** citations mask non-compliance. see unmasked people public day long.

At point I've come accept mask ordinances passed put paper pacify people actually interest finding COVID19 ""fake news"" themselves. suspicions China coronavirus Wuhan South China Seafood Market may also introduced result seafood imports True real change global demand. Even third entire human population shared level stupidity (which case) demand would still billions. Captain Obvious here.

That's Dr. Captain Obious you. Fucking idiot realise Apple bad vaccine microchip!!!!!

Say vaccines!

Say iPhones!




Sent Samsung Galaxy S10. Actually, Norway Denmark opened earlier Finland, said observe things go first. look like cases started grow even though use masks, make compulsory either. start basing views ‘what people make seem sometimes’?

If you’re going believe something strong basis confident think you’re what’s right

You’ll also able explain views believe  “All deaths testing... that’s good testing is!” Like many countries, Japan lower average mortality year. exactly need get handle on? [let press F worlds smallest  also shows possible. see example one success many failures, response be, ""what learn success?"" ""success impossible outlier"". article even mention flu season, confirms idea fear flu covid colliding may overblown. original article said Brazil's flu deaths half average far year. Fish delight. Scarlet fever joke. hospitalized 2012 5 days. turned rheumatic fever end day 4, sure I'd survive. Could break fever, could keep food meds down, incredibly painful body aches, unbearably cold even heated blankets, bed rash, even gather enough strength walk bathroom 5 feet bed. left permanently scarred heart valves. widely accepted definition ""a wave"" context specifies wave starts ends? unless definition ""wave"" specifies 1 wave per year (which must specify, rather simply note waves *tend* annual - important difference prescriptive descriptive definition), see make definition 

That's supposed work - stagnation drop daily new cases month two.   already voices China starting call ban foreign seafood imports, all, average person think kill eat seafood, eat domestic mean natural reservoirs like bats still might spread continue circulating among humans ? also lot people don’t want die alone. Hearing stories someone going hospital, able family visit, dying alone weeks later heart wrenching. Obviously gotten enough loans yet! Needs get money somehow Everything get them. Democrats gonna seize power throw Americans concentration camps! (I’ve heard one many times now) Oh, like American war zones. Cali? Tour De Covid. Imagine lung power super spreading. Keep eye South Carolina. 🐷 episode?  Yeah. absolutely believe intense lockdown could decimated virus. believe hot spots would controlled maintained.

the US utterly incapable managing thing. far large segment population *doesn't even think real*. Mask wearing ""scientific solution"", preventative measure along preventative measures (social distancing, isolating home, effective hand washing etc.) work together reduce community transmission. Oh jesus! HATE comment.

UK dweller here, we've roughly 45000 losses, doubters say ""Well know anyone who's died""

Conveniently ignoring country 70 million, assuming know least 1 45000 height arrogance. disingenuous. said would benefit 3 week lockdown. Exponential growth occurs, today, benefit authoritarian shutdown put place except extra 3 week buffer.

Also, nowhere guy say lockdown would eradicate (though might mention seem work New Zealand). hard contact trace posting numbers thousands. 

Here BC, one small city two private Canada day parties turned super spreader events (each 50 people). People attended parties went bar/restaurant hopping afterwards. Many town returned home spread individual cities. 

It started 8 confirmed cases currently 70+ positive cases related two, small parties across 3 generations (meaning people infected people infected people infected party). Contact tracing put 1000 people potentially exposed two parties currently ordered self-isolate.

This result extensive contact tracing pair parties started 8 positive cases. 

When posting cases thousands people give shit limiting social contacts, effective contact tracing pretty useless point. responding saying. stated certain individuals, certain reasons, might able wear masks.  I've responded reasons nonsense, except infants very, medical reasons. That's response saying.

You evidence saying. cannot cite medical authority says wearing mask necessary certain people (other infants few, rare cases). problem think hospitals reporting covid deaths get cash ignoring treatment get paid lose gun control men machine gun bed..... Fear two reasons think 

(1) - back way up

(2) - way back *despite everything done far* combat it. Unusual? whole pandemic order magnitudes beyond “unusual” would anyone expect procurement vaccine anything typical? makes sad Americans generalized way. country never “the best”. may richest one point (not necessarily positive mind) strongest military (definitely positive) certainly “the best”. would give anything future generation simple things like universal healthcare, affordable education, guaranteed vacation.

Unfortunately, government set way gives disproportionately large representation rural areas. wasn’t big deal country starting becoming increasingly urban best technical jobs located cities. means educated citizens flocked cities rural areas left everyone else. 

When voting power 1 citizen Wyoming = voting power 67 California, difficult country progress..this ended Trump Republican Senate majority. 

Sorry. End rant. I’m angry current system feel powerless anything it. think Americans share sentiment realize. don’t make entertaining news. Eventually I’ll right thought defunding police though? Face masks mandatory outside home Melbourne community transmission recommended parts Victoria NSW also community transmission lower numbers. 

I don’t think message ever masks effective necessary areas cases already quarantine/isolation test positive. said comment above, im entirely sure heavy breathing+grunting whatever enough aeresolize virus meaningful amount. 

I rotate onto covid floor hospital. wear standard surgical masks basically cloth masks, probably worse. dont even make covid patients put masks enter rooms yet. patients covid positive breathing heavy, coughing, etc pretty much constantly close proximity. dont start wearing n95s patients put super high flow oxygen intubated, etc. despite infection rate among employees pretty much zero. 

Im shutting learn more, definitely get right cases skyrocketing, dont think sure reddit makes be.  Indoor dining way worse people dont seem passionately opposed gyms. agree statement. many selfish people doomed others selfish reasons. denial follows anger.

The question target. number countries 0 cases. 

Name names. kind is.

A lot insanity foreign intelligence discovered easy manipulate US public using internet.

The part much dirt they've found current ruling party.

The final part agencies meant defending filled people loyal current ruling party. asking that. talking ""armchair"" epidemiologists hindsight. We're armchair hindsight. *Many* people forum backgrounds public health start saying recently. Dude gave kept coming back. life all? Bill Gates....duh!

/s one gun like edgy dangerous toys. Look way people gush semi automatic mass murder machines gun subreddits (bUT nEeD pROteCt lEfTiEs!!). 150,000 people died, deaths here? Movies? know spongebob.. Asians country well educated idiotic stigma mask wearing. rise deaths follows rise hospital admissions couple weeks ago, rise positive tests month ago. Since then, numbers positive tests continued rising rapidly.  positivity rate also increased, indicating number actual infections rising even faster number positive test results.

I think expect number deaths continue increasing, least another several weeks.  know death rate going slow down, ahead time, test positivity rate number positive tests decrease time.

I also doubt slow down, all, Florida issues statewide mask order, gets really serious enforcing it. 

DeSantis continues fiddle counting, state burning. presidential candidate exposed looming, sniffing opponent Russian puppet? Exxxxxxactly. ☝️

Makes yer skin crawl, don’t it? 

(I thought words myself.) ones kill parents, spouses, selves, neighbors won’t remain agreement.  Idk.. that's lot people make seem sometimes Holy shit. Wow.

I give up. want anyone fighting anyone WalMart. fact simple job. 2-3 guys entire store. One stands entrance stops anyone wearing mask tells required. One wanders store checking people remain compliant enter. 

The problem people take masks cause problem asked put back on. USA 4% global population 25% COVID cases! getting tired THINKING seeing people leaving house read permanent brain lung damage changed mind pretty quick. even responding I'm saying lmao. Gtfo That’s easy shut down: ask number total deaths US. previous years?

This called “excess deaths” regardless motive death, know people dying way previous years. 

Ask explain increase. narrative slyly slipped past non-thinking people preparedness precaution equal ""panic."" u. don’t.
If one kid 1000 dies looking 50 kids thrown bus. sounds like issue Texas healthcare system. horrifying. butt brain pooping everywhere. Interesting. understand correct think maybe explain it. took long detail? Analysis different Communication approaches wordings (or reasons) influenced Search behaviour? Timewise maybe also topics example? Like news coverage speech Impact changed searches? Maybe also state level result (increase cases example)? 

Sorry maybe dumb ask... also sorry many questions broken english. Yup. whole cloth mask thing works compliance high, that's well documented. Besides, consistently wearing N95 better device, chances becoming infected first place slim -- especially combining goggles, face shield, good hand hygiene.

You either leave risk infection best avoid spreading it... avoid infection first place.

If virus able infect anyone, would quickly disappear. RNA viruses _not_ alive. multiply wild like bacteria. simply strands RNA material encapsulated lipids. Without host, quickly decay.

Don't host.

One also simply slap cloth mask respirator. CT RI seem fine lmao that. saw fb. Georgia could lady charge saying mouth TV. know count source. work, Houston based, working home since mid-March. Working home law firm extremely easy days we've successfully months. started, said important thing health safety employees. hired medical expert advise reentry offices firm-wide. months ago, decided allow maximum 25% normal capacity enter office. originally intended bump 50% June, said increase cases made push back. impressed pleased taking seriously. 

Then things Houston decided get really bad, one worst hotbeds country. Record deaths every day... firm chose yesterday bump back 50% capacity announce full re-entry office month. Totally makes sense stop protective measures right everything getting worse, right? flight made big announcement nut-based products removed due passenger apparently deathly allergy them. 

No big deal. pretzels. guess what? didn’t anything flight eat drink would survived. 

The longest flight domestically excluding Alaska Hawaii 4.5 hours. 

Anyone cannot make long without eating drinking bigger issues. Hey you!!! get outta fax lojic. going disturb hive mind. Someone call thought police come arrest badthink. Shhhhhhhhhhh!!!!! southern hemisphere brazil think argument, yes. One find absurd, given minor short lived nature side effects.  even read comment? 10% lowest range 30% highest. highest range probably accurate death rate would line CDC’s estimates mean staff... meant staff serve. I’m serious. saw YouTube microchips track go, know, buy, much more. Completely unacceptable. 

Sent iPhone  Literally almost everyone thread exhibiting lack knowledge. no. I'm okoolosa yea I'm screwed ""A fix marijuana"" White house needs chill.

Shut FUCK Donnie element.  even close.

670 deaths per million population UK

442 deaths per million population USA

&amp;#x200B;

The USA would reach 222,000 deaths match UK's current ratio. http://m.koreatimes.co.kr/pages/article.amp.asp?newsIdx=289061

Another two super healthy 40 year olds mild case now, 4 months later seeing cardiologists neurologists. One old man withered died. One 40 year olds seems like different person way, character seems oddly changed. 

For worth. Maybe shall turn dried smoked products. Cold chain ensures virus imported fresh merchandise. Without cold chain, little chance virus survive transportation. really tiny dicks, need carry keep saying without federal funding negative margins. remember sending extra cash good margins. sad thing know people like this. argument is: ""How many pure COVID deaths? died pneumonia(or insert anything else), COVID."" basically, crazy heads, numbers falsely inflated. didn’t even take SAT. agree, sometimes hard breathe mask (after running while, example), still wear support others wearing it, best way reduce spread pandemic without total lockdown.

However, I've seen internet, people turning mask wearing literal cult. hundreds even thousands upvotes posts saying masks literally NEVER restrict breathing, unless already sick leave house. keep insulting downvoting anyone disagrees.

I know people lying, maybe lying good cause, still counter productive. someone already refuses wear mask problems breathing, get convinced statements like those. They're going assume people want wear masks liars. agree 100% idiot listen smart person?

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide It’s easy get last years previously difficult produce quickly difficult get shot. imagine we’ll see resurgence flu shot shortages production focusing COVID vaccines Maybe difference due increased testing?  update. Today going even worse Japan yesterday. least 800 new cases. new record.

And FYI, Japan's 'Go To' travel campaign kicks holiday weekend. health minister done well too.

Please aware us Germans also got incredibly lucky. one year ago, Spahn others (Leopoldina) wanted actually reduce intensive care beds hospitals. luck plan executed Corona hit. Otherwise it'd lot worse well. Hospitals around Stuttgart almost full peak. wrong convinced far complicated. nation deceived someone promises everything want, suspicious, suspicious. Also sometimes, swallow accident ! Really dangerous ! reliable numbers? I've heard US governement owns information releases convenience. Summer time, livin' (un)easy. NYC hot weather means everyone goes outside. need therapy  agree. also fault, telling STFU. RemindMe! 4 weeks “check death statistics” almost August... started action back March would open like many countries. need therapy I'm American first all, yeah, agree NZ would helped US, point though original comment said total lock would mean groceries, medical, etc.

I asked example country done said NZ know untrue COULD go groceries. mum issue too. tried different face coverings surgical mask much her. wears essentially thin scarf thing around her. doubt effective better nothing. know sure mosquitoes can’t transfer COVID? almost certainly psychological. mean really unpleasant - mean power it, fine.

I tried scuba once. Provably, air breathing oxygen free air, yet felt gasping breath whole time, air value. (I eventually power that, inner ear issues (which run family) stopped going on.)

I asthma too. situations take control breathing take deep, slow breath hold bit exhale fairly fast again. asthma control, people used wonder thinking something deeply, - breathing.

A mask asking lungs work 1-2% harder most. would threshold human perception, except mask right there, reminding it.

If learn technique centering breathing calming way, quickly find masks annoying, doable.

Also, breath control trick works even deal actual pain injuries. idea mostly theoretical fell hole one night Bali dislocated shoulder made huge hole leg... much worse response population defiant. Even Wuhan locked time hospitals go even close point. bound second wave,might well speed Umm.....I personally struggled breath N95 ""For bike,not medical,with valves""(I know difference back January)

I'm Never Anti mask Japanese.I want know truth.Here Japanese doctors began tell ""running mask dangerous""
(I Japanese news paywall currently - source:Asahi shinbun)

Maybe reduce ""A little bit""of oxygen.We careful Summer.

I wish someone probe this,but cannot kid wearing N95 ran 1km!! mean mask dangerous course.Don't freak please)

It's balancing act,I guess.

In Japan,we told ""Wear cloth mask many people around,wear surgical mask many people around"". 

We season heat stroke.Knowing merit slight risk helps us.

(Edit:As wear masks without told,I wonder post not.) doesn’t need war. needs something outrageously racist. That’s Trump’s go to. Thats happens idiots voice internet Take life instead putting piece cloth.... America get ur shit together South Africa hit 500+ today. averaging 100 200 before. doctor said worry get reinfected take precautions case assumed common knowledge. worst thing dimwits refuse wear mask psychos use gun solve argument. Finally someone smart. 

UK too, ask question.  

Few friends saying mask wearing rule coming pointless. They’ve seen studies saying don’t work etc. 

Basically think masks way make us feel safe go get economy going offering additional protection. case? study? Pretty sure memory cells thing biology school (Upper, aged 17)! also sounds like downplaying deathrate really know expect.

How?

I'm ""downplaying."" however pointing New York's CFR absolutely higher actual CFR is. think serious debate that. point is, really good CFR United States. desire get data driven desire get better hopefully see another NYC knows several states hit hard simultaneously resources potentially running thin look like.

I mean, mean? see CFR New York saw, unique time situation. rate cases, see similar number cases, that's point, without knowing better CFR, comparing cases silly.

For example:

* New York 400,000 cases, 32,000 deaths, CFR 8%.

* Florida currently 400,000 cases, 5,000 deaths, CFR 1.5%

As result discrepancy, Florida gets claim ""we better democratic governors,"" stupid. importantly, makes very, hard guess Florida's CFR rate spreading uncontrolled (as previously assume # cases florida focused YOUNG people cases spread older folk CFR likely mention many people/leaders states mentioned already taking virus seriously. Telling might deadly counterprductive convinced masks stupid.

This strongly disagree. believe put forward FALSE MISLEADING stats order scare monger. reality scary. Instead, think folk need DAMN CAREFUL stats put exactly reason said - folk claim Florida New York number cases (true) Florida much, much, much fewer deaths (true), asshole ASSUME Florida less deaths (a) governor better, (b) virus less deadly cause mutated, (c) virus's initial numbers ""faked"" order scare monger, (d) ?

My point being, want accurate number AVOID stupid conclusions like that. 

Get it? bars closed We're faking make Trump look bad, werent meeting?? Awesome. Wireless earbuds outdated   SIDS risk back sleep infants. 12-24 months, it’s probably keeping mask toddler longer 5 minutes pretty much impossible.  It’s important public know, health officials held accountable let mistake repeat again. I'd like see stats alcohol consumption.

I've ration stash drinks. I've gone bar since February US never suffer consequences actions. collective psyche. cannot combat this, unlike countries actually bear consequences actions. I'm New Zealand. four weeks lock down. could go supermarket (grocery store) socially distance 2m other. basically unless ill needed see doctor, work deemed essential way. Think emergency services, necessary utilities, etc. could also go outdoors exercise - close home. unnecessary driving.

These days we're almost back normal life. Works still going on. I'm fact, got back pub.

America could locked completely month two, mean really locked down. Americans general pigheaded self centered suffer minor discomfort long greater good. I'm blaming guys, cultural thing grown (freedom comes everything, personal responsibility, etc) that's situation. mean fucks sake, can't even put bloody mask fellow citizens sake.  I'm sure leaders already imagined baffles ok this... one thing managed get state leaders roughly track. I'm sure allay fears. Netherlands Sweden still official stance government condescending thinking claiming refugee status political violence broke US? That’s literally system for, reason might able claim asylum Canada *because* it’s sovereign country.

Not Canada would ever accept refugees US though, would upset US government Canada would never that. No, that's spread autism. (/s dumb people) Sometimes got watch game feel joy again. doubt oath really formality.... honestly don’t even really remember said graduation, think halfway drunk since virtual year lol. 

It shouldn’t oath drives well job. fact you’re responsible person takes pride job WANT well.   Elon Musk soon. listen music head. ok? I’ve gone get they’ve told “heads up, we’re low doses, don’t recommend getting you’re young healthy.” last years however it’s easy get although change year everyone focusing COVID vaccine production vaccine available December best case scenario. Schools haven’t even opened yet, Trump hell bent happen. Due Covid-19 bot unsure user around one month.

/s that's something person would say wants implant microchips people! feel way exactly? Legit curious, Niedersachsen here. impression Söder played strong man TV really anything extraordinary (apart implementing ""lockdown"" like, day earlier). quarantine place. remember footage. lot leaking pipes beds. it. guy attached Trump's rectum since start this. one worst states increasing Covid cases, yet he's done next nothing prevent it. funny downplay severity ask sweet Covid relief.

To make matters worse, lot people state, especially older folks, like him. amount old folks see walking around stores without mask staggering. hey, least thin numbers come voting time 👌

So guess that's positive way. 🔫👨‍🚀 literally 1.5 hr conversation w friend bf this. “We think hoax... don’t know anyone that’s died.. you? numbers inflated... grandpa who’s 90 died Covid shouldn’t counted.. wear masks...” 

I dumbfounded tbh. Flabbergasted word conspiracy theories get dumber minute 🤦‍♂️ right. must done something wrong. people love Söder much, anything ""first"" state worst others. Literally go state NRW maybe Berlin. Manuela Schwesig nice really need stop focusing rehashing badly US botched beginning pandemic though. mean, certainly horrendous job, we’ve unfortunately got work we’ve got. Seriously? mask? They’re pretty hide. Around 40 million Iranians Covid. official numbers countries much lower.  Jeez. Stop testing people stop dying, obviously. Hey, Fina, like responses forum lot, would like ask consider people come might ask ""obvious questions"" emotionally unwell state. state, sometimes people think straight. moment like injured, bled heavily head instead seeking medical attention, got dressed went church could think anything else moment. tho. 100% fact. mother, nurse practitioner, confirmed it. Sidenote, tertiary education free Germany. mean lizard-men Zodiac Killers. Good really red herring mask debate

Maskphobes really complaining low O2 sats. complaint breathlessness.

The main trigger breathlessness cases low O2 high CO2. mask expected lower O2 significantly air coming still 20% O2, increasing airflow resistance dead space (essentially distance air needs pulled reach lungs) might lead CO2 accumulation. Maybe, maybe not, even tiny non-life threatening shift towards higher CO2 might make random guy feel breathless, can't erase feeling sticking saturimeter fingers proclaiming ""see? O2 decrease"".

I get important convince people wear masks, think line argument likely change mind anyone already understand mask wearing tiny sacrifice benefits everyone. idea chose uae? exactly hotspot efficacy tested Late winter? quite mild winter Sweden year large parts even meteorological winter. Spring also earlier usual. wont able shift blame

Trump says hold hamberder Drosten Ultras! FYI sort took restriction again. work 28 hours call days. don’t like either residents shit, one cares well lol Sadly, help much microdroplets stay air long time (over half hour air circulation) even person without mask left. People keep dying getting sick. Meth head may less harm. Oh shit. knew would happen make less heartbreaking. 

It's also opinion who've publicly vocal wearing masks allowed hospital treatment get covid. horrible thing say, need learn hard way. Make room followed rules. Sadly, surges takes many many weeks die assuming real changes behavior. Guaranteed high level infection heading school year. sacrificed kids education open bars, casinos, gyms, barber shops. People kept saying there'd breakdown hospitals they'd overflow.

I've replying time let get -- they'd instead. Start gatekeeping, keep ones worst odds probably also tighten criteria get admitted milder cases.

This probably model systems across US census gets high. fuck benefits lying death rates high.

A family member mine works nursing home. said every single time patient dies, often old people nursing homes die time, staff local hospital treated patient desperately searching excuse classify Covid death.

Go ahead dismiss anecdote reason lie it. Frat parties bars always highly likelihood ruining semesters without COVID youporn pay it! percentage 20 year olds smart enough take seriously, there’s excuse. young \= homicidal idiot. [For anybody wonders hes joking  felt beginning businesses stayed open declaring essential claim reviewed maybe faced fines lied. local manufacturer declare essential one sites sometimes makes body parts firetrucks ambulances. sites stayed open. That's bullshit. forgotten discussion. Unfortunately, looking like virus weakened much yet. likely eventually, yet. dominant strain worldwide contagious original strain, would expected. However, symptoms appear significantly weakened yet.

I see hospitals Texas now, soon be, sending patients poor survival changes back home space them. Sadly, things coming full circle. Well look Ducey Arizona clues. American, desperately want move EU. country humanity favors. still morbidly joking America? Let know y'all desperate action stage start discussing make change. Come Aussie land. spiders shoes check put on, magpies swoop you, kookaburra (bird) laugh make annoying noise wake up, snakes hide basement, lots lizards (ngl, kinda fascinating see touch) finally, fucken roasting death.

To truthful, exaggerated. extreme person know 75. Believes tucker carlson people family work medical field.  Says numbers fake.  read lot articles make decisions. Critical thinking seems lacking lot people 5% still pretty much..I dont know ever known anyone ever carried gun. knew 5% population around carried guns Id fucking terrified going outside knowing random mental cunt could blow head time. Humans fragile, unstable creatures allowed carry guns streets.. New achievement great America  People test positive could also recovered cases, previously asymptomatic mildly symptomatic clearing dead virus material bodies, would register positive test, one report mentioned virus material taken asymptotic carriers cultured failed replicate lab, suggesting people recovery phase. metallic taste reminds Chernobyl, sure source ionizing radiation nearby (like black stone brought vacation thinking lava stone created volcano eruption, whereas reality piece carbon exploded RBMK reactor :-))?

EDIT: Oh use dosimeter check radiation, trust 3.6 value ceiling low level soviet dosimeters, although 3.6 roentgen home would severe own, equivalent 400 chest x-rays per hour, 1 chest x-ray every 9s, basically continuous nonstop x-raying, kinda like hot women go around Clark Kent.

They're banking distractions keeping people line. *any* Beatrice's fault?

Oh! Right! not. fucking hate logic. know anybody who's Superbowl, think whole game hoax. lot similarities dad Donald trumps dad. According new book written niece, type thinking taken it’s extreme made Donald way is. right train logic though, since terrorism extremely rare US, whilst Coronavirus isn't. I’m sorry loss. tragedy. media biggest factor spreading bullshit. stats Trumped up. People actually choose put car? thought maybe something keep cars getting close strippers. Countries Northern Hemisphere following Coronavirus prevention best practices also going mild flu season.

For US, flu season probably less severe might also unpredictable. makes hard select flu strains upcoming flu vaccine idea strain actually prevalent. US seems struggle simple best practices like masks Coronavirus 3 rd wave fall seems inevitable (if ever get second wave). chance flu strain circulates annual vaccine misses mark. also hope despite rhetoric, CDC still working determine strain include vaccine. Weird bc president said lowest mortality rate.

So weird right people think plastic screens sole protection versus virus? employers decided scrap 2m social distancing plastic screens bring peeps office. He’s best... easily, could prevented same. Breaking news: people die diseases

And Obama people would say ""Look fascist trying take rights away! knew it!"" saying Americans dumber every country largely controlled it?

Yes, without doubt. large percentage country bright country whole highest ceiling success, also low floor idiocy incredible. possible anti-science narcissistic leader screwed pooch short amount time people self control stay inside?

... still people, daily, refusing put masks going far say medical condition. know idiots like Trump get elected educated, smart populace right? still sign God alright, way pastor said was. I'd love know there's correlation party preference BMI. 

It means nothing, like preconceptions confirmed.

Edit: aaaand go: covariates constant, 1% increase county-level support Republican candidate corresponds 0.02% increase age-adjusted obesity rates.   *Only fool learns mistakes. wise man learns mistakes others.* 

\- Otto von Bismarck.  Shut up. America trash. Enjoy trash guess Trump right though magically disappear, Americans gone. God must miserable around denying friends would say people dying car accidents counted covid. General: win war Covid rudimentary understanding statistics willing suffer moderate inconvenience 6-8 weeks. 

America: GG election projections? Yeah. death projections, nope. Like pregnant diabetic?  holes wear masks now? Works me.

Doesn't work many families, though. know families 5 children single working parent single smartphone sole internet access.

We need solution everyone. feels good. Also freaking pandemic, *they* (whoever are) catch it, increases chances *I* catch it. World wide pretty conservative estimate Amazing think Democrats competent enough organize nationwide conspiracy involving 1000+ people also able get rest world well. keeping complete secret one whistleblower. Sometimes feel like Bill Gates announces stuff finds reddit usually 2 weeks behind So, like deathpanels? pfizer made business decision gouging people, effectively neutralizing fucking market grift people. Bravo play. Really going fucking piss gilead developer. wonder they'll react like actual plan calls for, food would delivered National Guard, doctors work quarantined. 

Okay, since missing points purpose, goodbye. average age death literally average us lifespan....


It's sad, average lifespan person nursing home spends 13 months. covid deaths old folks passing away months earlier normally would have. bit spreadsheet nerd tracking, daily, numerous metrics since early March Worldometers. facts, none fun;

- took US 4 months get 1m cases (starting 01/01/2020)
- took 2 months get 2m
- took 1 month hit 3m
- took 20 days reach 4m
- track hit 5m 14 days

While case fatality rate (more accurate overall mortality) steadily falling, currently 8%. 2m active cases, times case fatality rate means people sick today, 160 000+ perish. 

The new case count currently double peak saw Spring, days 35 000+ new cases shocking closed country down. Current new case counts frequently 70 000. 

The 1918 flu active 2 years, took late 1940’s eradicated. CV19 7 months old, become endemic us generations. two day weekends?

Marxist. worldwide America?

For refence, peak daily death rate Wuhan less ... 150. forget 0. Total cases China curently sit 85.000. That's bit cases US ... single day. Man wish really conspiracy wide spread competent think is. least would someone helm ship. us sure least someone. proven is, one power knows hell going anymore anyone else. sure reality worse. still uninsured called healthcare marketplace asking options said didn’t wait 2021 medical coverage. people want healthcare work I’m trapped whole life. People dying never died before! Perhaps police strangle minorities need protest.  saying believe it, argument hysteria allows forced austerity working folks moving trillions dollars hands already wealthy. latter happened, adding fuel theory. that's probably certain states already hitting testing capacity.    ""back"". two cases, quarantined them, new cases result. Correct I'm wrong, contagious wide spread virus is, greater chance even harmful mutations road, right? Texas inevitably turns blue due ever-growing latino tolerant white populations, think guy's head might explode. 

And yet, remove racist/xenophobic connotations, point completely baseless. There's LOT nothing Texas. parents sister live hours away decent-sized town. They're going trip visit relatives north really concerned it. Meanwhile live Corpus Christi, apparently real hotbed right now, today decided stay put. 

The main thing many people live nothing parts Texas compared metropolitan areas. Texas majorly fucked, evenly spread across state. Yes? original comment want 100% complete lockdown 3 weeks. Everyone would get 3 weeks food, groceries that, water sanitation doctors. keep putting exceptions, that's comment asked for, asked exceptions, hard get? wonder America failure comprehension like that. Absolutely none. vaccine come first wave continues rise tries swallow entire US. course herd immunity ultimate goal - matter attained. probably going vaccine rather everyone getting disease.

And that's disagree; think likely vaccine available develop herd Immunity naturally via spread, mutation virus and/or better therapeutic (best case virus weakens, therapeutic response better) results people caring anymore return normalcy virus.

But idk, merely base hypothetical endgame historical evidence, science data vs. hopes dreams government save us. calculate deaths caused covid necessarily infection.

Last year X amount people died. year 1500 + x.

We fewer accidents roads. lot scared people come heart attacks. 

Also UK smaller way densely packed USA. disease still burning cities would considered small towns here. small town middle nowhere bigger new Orleans! 

There's also lag. takes weeks deaths go up.

Finally last issue initially deaths going places left lockdown unaffected... herd immunity. also least healthy obese. lash disease hit places leadership poor science great.

Finally UK deaths due stupid decision made 1990s house prices 2000s public sector pay. Houses expensive people never house younger age groups. live shared houses. houses seen investments government treats way government treats stock prices. matter... Prices go up. Conservatives pay freezes carers public sector staff also mean stuck live extensible shared flats.

They also likely carry disease. young healthy. it? initial symptoms mild current hayfever way way worse. Finally cuts social care privatised care often means bouncing back elderly NHS normal.

Meaning matter time till nursing homes outbreak. Private nursing homes blame NHS sending sick patients still making profit without spending money PPE training.

Then there's issue DNAR. recusitate medical decision. lot people getting CPR USA inappropriate. Post arrest life quality worse. may see outcomes that. heart beating chained broken body lives bed breathing tube count.

And finally.

The UK swabs dead. anyone Covid counts due covid presenting multiple methods killing via clotting cascade. cause PE cause stroke heart attack. 

Hence high number. (Source doctor NHS.) also reduced number thorough research dexamethasone remdesivir adoption CPAP ventilation options. Although dexamethasone still best outcomes. know much air goes time breathe? I'm gonna guess mask less air that, would mean extra air comes somewhere else. rebreathing air

What surgeons wear mask hours? think they're allowed operate whilst CO2 poisoned?  google it. It’s there. Hello, never understood use disinfectants soap everything, rinsing food water fine.

Food pores, use soap. skin pores too.

Food apparently transmit covid-19, eat contaminated food, still touch mouth contaminated hands, why?

So want eat apple grab hand, hand dirty, eat apple, must careful touch mouth hand so. silly? really think make call another week two. 4th July 3 weeks ago we've seen pretty sharp uptick cases. Deaths trailing another couple weeks we'll see plays out. Hopefully less deadly strain taken enough headway see sharp ride deaths saw months ago. China wanted go war, would good time.  What's utility it? Obviously something go way do, surely 50% people know feel mortally threatened every time leave house. Me? Lol. little bit fence COVID cousins husbands dad died 53 years old one healthiest older people know. Shit real.  Florida could go strike

That would illegal according Florida Constitution.

The good news is, delusional dipshits seem also lap susceptible quite lot. Bad news, lifes going brutally hard another year least.  what? deliberately missing point seems. holding onto life hard. say that, Phase 3 requires least 300 patients. Without state city mandating lockdown, even without individual districts/facilities closing childcare options, parents’ jobs jeopardy.
My clinic supportive put parents LOA schools shut rest state. 
As soon things opened Texas started pushing childcare resources, LOA accommodations over. told continue file unemployment, committing fraud clinic open work available.
I’m part time. best could keep job &amp; hope improved.
It got worse.
The kids attend camp. procedures significantly better school do. 8-10 people per separated groups, enforced masks, strict sanitation procedures etc.

There’s us want send kids camp. There’s us want school. There’s us never received single penny unemployment lockdown thusly faith thrown sea millions others also unemployed. Teachers similar situation families jobs.

Without shutting down-
The state/city/district whatever power be, fucked.

My school district gave us choice person virtual. job made abundantly clear chosen keep job. 
I 7/27 make choice school year. Every single day schools call pressuring choosing now.

This frustrating watch another state without school age kids. can't imagine parents coping. Ha! Good one. initial comment, said it’s ok virus becomes endemic could become like common cold. That’s grave error cannot ignored.

There certain individuals almost certainly could get reinfected -- people recovered suffer one number things might destroy (permanently temporarily) immune system (some times cancer cancer treatments, genetic disorders, advanced HIV disease, etc.). people get reinfected with...anything.

Probability everything risk, really. unlikely talking hundreds cases many millions primary infections, even worth discussing.

Go back June 23: 5400 cases. daily death rate approximately double 350-400 per day hit top infection curve. know deaths reported know 100% percentages actually are.

True. real fatality could way higher could way lower. seems pretty clear choosing believe former instead latter even though science way lower fatality rate (many scientists agree close 0.1% co-morbidities present).  made chart?

Kicked habit 2014 (19 years) second lockdown inevitable soon states opened early. metric safe reopening, assuming masks social distancing, 4 new cases day per 100k people. 3 50 states met metric, people still wearing masks etc.

Yes, inevitable. reality almost certainly reached milestone months ago. Brazil *way* testing. According [John Hopkins Brazil's time daily testing numbers 32 per 100k population (United States 168 per 100k population reference) group, there's 33.2% positivity rate. Peru country entire world higher daily positivity rate Brazil, their's staggering 46.28%. first time Dewine tried implement mask mandate, armed protesters showed state capital, screaming masks violate rights caved within 24 hrs. reason numbers improved much locked down. Honestly, masks mandated Ohio prior July 4th first started seeing infection numbers spike. Possibly that, primarily check county's numbers. Instead, couple weeks went Dewine pleaded public wear masks social distance own. Counties high rates infection implement mask mandates. Ignoring people travel across county lines every day work, etc. And, course, protesters right back state capital feel right plague rats. know effective mask mandate going keep seeing news lot local law enforcement refuse enforce mandate. I've seen multiple sheriffs news, saying decision wear mask belong individual bother calling report people wearing masks. correct. NY's confirmed cases much lower (Edit: ""should"" be) lack tests peak, artificially makes disease look deadly there. Also, treatment gotten somewhat better since then. Also, IMHE unfortunately currently Texas (somewhat) narrow gap next months.

I would throw something Texas excess deaths well, NY plenty excess deaths peak. remember liking outdoors mandatory mask order came effect country. could hardly enjoy daily walks mask. Limited sense smell, glasses fogging up, dampness inner layer...

But I've adjusted, actually like wearing mask. Hell, liberating sense. mind wearing one makes social distancing non-compliant people easier. I've even learned wear mask properly glasses fog up. seasonal allergy, masks help cope sneezes public transport. simply sneeze mask hands-free.

The downside get mad people wearing masks properly (if all) stores... Like really mad. NY probably actually 100000 new infections day need new clients Trump suggested

He suggest way something like injection inside almost cleaning?

Unfortunately testing system seemingly getting overwhelmed 2.7% could get much 7-day rolling average ~ 1800 new deaths day mid-Augest best case scenario currently peak new case. relies detection rate remaining stable overwhelmed testing system.

Compare population 100 people 10% immunity, 100% 90 people still fully susceptible virus -- 1 person catching virus every 10 days, right? removing 10% slow spread virus, taking 10% likely spreaders leaving 90% original likely spreaders? far see, merely reduces spread around 10%. Instead 1 person getting every 9 days, 1 person get around every 10 days. home town city too. still worst job market country. still applies. employers also refuse wear masks/enforce mask wearing? Asking someone trump loving non mask wearing boss 100% able done home job denied that. Actual reason recommendation wear masks: availability worries

From gather US sometimes pocket costs medical treatment well, even insurance? even work already fucking money getting paid?

No, entire premise hypothetical. literally stating lockdowns beneficial effect.

Also, even example exponential growth, surely know lower starting point would better, right? Good news tag! Shit yes let's take money neighbor called it? #RandPaulCatchersMitt value ""so far good"" kind way. Also countries ahve proven virus control - flatten curve, flipped around ran ground, giving time set proper infrastructure testing proper track trace measures. Giving hope future outbreaks contained track trace without economically destructive lockdowns. 

Had countries managed maybe world would going back normal now, certain countries decided let run rampant. main challenges majority countries handled responsibly prevent form entering countries ignored it, contain internal outbreaks. 

But unless something unprecedented happen, really good grounds optimistic virus situation countries. locked thought we'd flatten curve, instead managed reduce infections lot. country small outbreaks happen contained effective track trace quarantine. faith cans till done, long borders closed countries control.

It lie said masks effective ""healthy"" people pandemic. Unless telling he, experienced infectious disease expert, know masks help respiratory virus, especially knew late January asymptomatic transmissions occur. would sad. wouldn’t agree lack experience wearing masks bad mask etiquette argument wearing mandating masks UK. need educate people people hopefully pick up, 10% people wear incorrectly it’s still better mandating all. 

You’re correct social distancing fallen way side since mask wearing become commonplace, partly think move 1m made trickier honest 1m isn’t actually big people great measuring eye! 

But wouldn’t see arguments ‘against’ masks, unfortunate features them. cannot second agree masks may cause ‘more problems solve’ option mandatory mask wearing enclosed spaces. What? x% 0 0. 2x many democracts Republicans California ( google ""california percentage democrat republican"" believe misinformed, Fox news proganda spewing idiot).

The silver lining losing retail job due pandemic longer put fools customers. Back mid-April got disagreement /u/Dick_Dynamo effectiveness stay-at-home orders. argument states orders overreaching. thought people could trusted following social distancing preventive measures, placing legal restrictions makes people willing resist them. 

I told dude coming months states would ease soon lockdowns due pressure public (the stupid anti-mask anti-lockdown protests) result would see rising cases again, especially places high population density.

I told hoped wrong, are...

Turns understand human behavior fine, /u/Dick_Dynamo . problem carry disease quite time showing symptoms. flu shorter incubation time makes easier sick people stay home. Local semi-lockdowns actually inevitable cluster pops up.  Belgium seem label every death coronavirus related. downplayed someone mentions second highest rate San Marino.

Skeptics exist countries obviously reporting even reporting. Tandom civillians armed teeth shooting people dead. Yep, another example America fucked long Covid-19 came along. Hopefully, situation seems dire. testing issue actually quite critical right now. week ago read test positive rate risen 1/3 Shinjuku, Tokyo ( ) implies even numbers shown right may severely underestimated. covid std would people treat differently? 40-60k die 40-50 million infected, that's quote 0,1 %. know come 0,0000003% rate. 
Yet, corona death-rate estimated 0,5% contagious. also incredibly difficult spread thanks modern basic hygiene... Yes, watch twice realised red hotter dark burgundy - aargh. thought liberals concerned overpopulation! 

We hearing soon. Taking advantage poor people, unnecessary surgery, billing people two days held minutes past midnight, etc Hi, anyone clarify I've hearing coronavirus decline US? wondering current state virus now. Ok soon get see much immunity NYC see. bound happen. Unfortunate. public excess deaths report? Thanks interesting link. looked lots graphs. wish didn’t. do. uncle.  efforts useless course, access testing widespread (even states terrible delays tests results) better hospital protocols, treatments contact tracing efforts. 

However 2 months lost terms curve means could've moderately safe reopen things like tourism, sport venues, concerts multitudinary events come september/october, going see June-like numbers time that's even supposing curve started going soon(it's going to), ultimately, many, many completely preventable deaths

Also Americans wont accepted first world countries early 2021, leasr Joe Biden figure out. probably looking instead. US somewhat average.

Anyway, testing good unless actually something testing data, nearly pointless. understanding US tests country (in absolute numbers) test results take 1 3 weeks arrive (which makes mostly useless) essentially ignored anyway.

So... seen here, looks like way pretend something actually something. Hey, wanted say I’m glad you’re us today :) 1/10 people wearing masks live now... use 9/10 Dude, stuff prescription only.  really americans love party cost lives others. [Give mask tug did, looking bottle Advil see people might - ""Pfizer"" branding - fact, place mentioned last line label peel outside label away see. FUCK TRUMP FUCK EVERY REPUBLICAN profitable hospitals?

Insurance. medical costs over-inflated. Hospitals bill insurance companies, insurance companies funded employers, workers end underpaid addition locked shitty jobs fear losing vital health services.

Welcome land free. Let help, Gov Cuomo everything could information (and continues so). 45 put tough position ignoring virus. NYC dense MUCH international traffic bound spread there, ignoring made blossom. since beginning treating worked yet, people dying. Ronny hand information, literally information handle chooses ignore cause he's busy kissing Donny's ass. two states, one held example Fauci handle it, Florida. someone traveling Delta flight Monday, GOOD. Vote God damn idiot office. Compared first world countries. privatized Healthcare industry instead national health service, we've lay thousands nurses middle pandemic one example.

But yeah- building healthcare system for-profit complex creates system can't sustain situation covid-19 levels patient volumes. hospitals designed treat 200%+ capacity patients unable foot bill lost health insurance. Hospitals businesses first, services second US.

You figure rest this. Google. think concentrated 3 word slogans hoped best.

I mean cummings indispensable ? needs follow scientific advice slogans. million day would take year procure enough entire country yeah, millions seem beyond scope necessary. wind useless vaccine SNAFU. taking calculated (and wise) risk. think 3 deals far and, deals vary, cases get money back. idea ideally vaccine need day approved. Manufacturers make vaccines quantity schedule think make money. probably going pre-manufacture vast quantities required entire world. risky. 

So takes risk? do. lose billion useless vaccine that's cheap compared price paying living virus. started responding ""We'll, know lepers either, I'm gonna run join one fucking clubs."" Breakfast Club. gets point across. clicks tell 4 people know personally died. construct find another place athletes.

Nope. delaying handover athletes' village. wrapped duvet. numbers actually UK rather England - Although campaign England, survey UK-wide.

The actual title article is: ""More One Million UK Citizens Quit Smoking COVID-19 Pandemic"" Working furiously suddenly vaccine break window penetrate arm without asking let save work. New reddit? manage small team fivem across globe. perform work remotely, told January stop coming offices work remotely. one believed me, one cared time, are, thankful come office. uk government waiting old, sick, non tax payers die rolling vaccine. Campaign promised promises fulfilled Windows 10 also needs multiple updates remain stable. reply points out, seem calculated differently difficult compare. Melbourne Sydney's CBD functionally similar large cities Europe, USA etc. busy periods, footpaths packed, public transport full - they're empty cities density numbers seems suggest.

But even point - simply high-lighting fact despite Australia's large land mass, empty population quite concentrated relatively small area. Oh no. Time bailout cigarette companies miss part statistics showing ban China racist ones spreading disease en masse Europeans were. racist ban China cases coming Europe? 

If China singled US ban cases coming Spain whatever, I'd consider racist too. Also mandatory anyone coming China go government quarantine take COVID test. singling American diplomats here. 

Also let fix second last sentence: Europeans infected Americans later infected Americans due mind boggling levels horrendous government mismanagement.

Your version ""world"" Europe + US. Asia many African countries fine. You’ll need continue self-isolate apply:

* fever 5 days

* 14 days since first developed symptoms

Source: lie masks effective “healthy” people pandemic.

Also, already knew asymptomatic transmissions late January.

*Coronavirus: People ‘just find out’ asymptomatic spread:* least dont collect weapons designed kill tens hundreds people look cool exactly someone wants install 5G mast nose would say.

Seriously low IQ people believe shit Bill Gates almost entirely different species point. even trying communicate people. American, deeply regret plan move abroad motion next year last year. unregulated capitalism

The problem US what's **il**legal, what's *legal*. screening

I wonder, thermal screening really useful? I've seen deployed pretty much everywhere China, reliable, right? Huge amounts false positives false negatives, far understand.

Or way quickly alert area suspicion hotbed covid contagion? somewhere Germany banned burkas schools recently? “Only 1% kids die! They’re less susceptible.” 

1. child death ok?

2. Schools closed shit hit fan. KNOW can’t get really bad they’re exposed repeatedly, day day? 

3. don’t care teachers/staff then? (Rhetorical, it’s evident already don’t) winning dad ? HSE says 5 days. OP Ireland (which kinda doubt, sure) need self isolate 2 days longer. Bumfuck idiots vote bumfuck idiots. muh Jesus muh guns. Nothing it. weird virus jumped wuhan south korea (and italy well), ignoring huge mainland china them, day still havent heard explanation that,it makes sense okay deaths hardship come shutting economy down? suicides etc.? guess txzman saying we're going deviate norm (shut everything fuck down), better better damn good reason. covid ain't it. well ""it's elderly"" something fund better provide supplies? staff overworked need breaks? airlines ban people ? There's limit N95s too. meant worn long term either. like armour. ""better"" enough exposure still get through. 

Everyone wears mask, tries stay apart stays home symptomatic cut spread clearly seen medical staff antibody take days sick (because fevers symptoms). 

And age's issue. partner's illness miserable long term effects basically can't kids. 

Sufficient layers protection mean improvements. cannot go back way used things, sharp break point move working home offloading ""work"" 9 5 ""goal orientated scheme"" achieved mostly site. need rethink society whole. rush back bad old days.    Wtf? let door.... True, also right thing do. live democracy. functioning democracy consists many gears work together, ruled one big ""leader"" king whatever.

By standing side lines listening things professionals said exactly right thing. Yeah, gonna take least 200 years get human rights figured out, mean 800 years since magna carta, understand takes time think children die much (thousands max transmit parents grandparents would great loss like 100s thousands)  don’t need inflate numbers make claim. government advocating glory holes. real life? Nah, risk compensation real thing happens wherever people perceive safety measures reduce risk. Whether would've happened case another matter. UPDATE: got fam.

Edit: parallelograms happens single body (like national health service) negotiate large contracts absolutely disproportionately killing black, Latino, Native American people. German response isolated miracle; many European (and especially Asian) countries well informing population clearly start. I'm quite sure agenda, any, behind Germany New Zealand usually picked singular successes countries. China suck nuts 19 hour delay fetching comments.

Maybe NY one area improved significantly. Cringe, racist axe grind town, shocked see apparent apathy toward protections state poor covid numbers. Exactly. hold breath hydraulic two wave hold already winded excruciating relative wearing fucking mask. Twenty seconds feels like god damn eternity roll up. think speaking two different sports (surfing vs kayaking), think know exactly I'm talking about!! 

These people gd babies. NY also advantage hotspots regionalized hospitals upstate able absorb excess patients. states currently trouble seeing hotspots map hopsital conserve resources. Plus, lot patients died quickly April, freeing beds, better managing patients (hospitalized mortality dropped 1/4 April's rates) ones got quality care likely survive continue needing bed, means fewer people get in. downplay New York did, situation different unprecedented. article almost 4 months old, still say “positive doesn’t mean contagious”... oh god 🤦🏻‍♂️ governments entire planet put first also secret. case wanted avoid shortage medical supplies. complicated.   Let pay electric bill keeping running.
Electric meter go brrrrr Canada ~30 days onset symptoms death. Going rough fall holiday season. thoughts exactly. seeing shared instagram facebook ad nauseum today, point misinformation, ""oh published scientific article! PubMed!"" baffles me. people simultaneously call dismantlement scientific establishments used dubious agendas.  read article pdf published along? headline image one faulty models. Nothing article implying ""masks work"". giving list 100 models sold around Europe found fake/not working advertised. test done lab Valencia. know much scientific clarity need. day 1 I’ve afraid unknown long term effects initial symptoms. banning people wearing representative free society? Soemthing compute lol absolutely profits vaccines. Big pharma makes money keeping old sick alive Yes, like someone dies ""With"" bullet wounds. South Koreans still wearing masks would absolutely done lockdown contact tracing failed (was action plan). people much stronger reaction Westerners since SARS fresh memory. Thailand, Vietnam, Indochina general lockdowns. exactly. I've saying forever people shouting snowflake folks easily outraged offended. thing people throwing fit businesses requiring masks rights infringed upon. They're people think businesses make cakes gay couples. hit all! seems Corona less effective smokers reason government knowingly gives poor health advice purposes, wonder else could about? looked data. deaths come people 60 majority deaths come people 80.  comment needs made though, shitty clickbait headline/title.

The title post along lines ""fake masks found spain protect infection"". Instead title (and top image) implies another masks work article, comment needs made.on everything resembles masks work article. Even headline, people read.the headline title post, comments. United States:

*Sell soul* One doctor Japan trying recommend use Double-sided tape
around surgical mask make fitting better.(It's actually really good idea,not makes fitting better,reduces glasses crowding too)

I hope try it,and tell feel. injectable micro tracking device person whose company gave Windows vista? might take conspiracy theory compliment  would like see exactly research is. shown DNA, shown process human cells produce fucking viruses (wtf), shown viruses produced symptoms individuals produced anyone came contact with. they've said ""hey, understand biology, kinda seems like maybe viruses work way"" categorically not. 

&amp;#x200B;

And again, seem understand, one funded research here. editorial, article. undergone peer review, even published journal, authors affiliated universities, mean universities funded this. 50% want vaccine make much easier 50% get vaccine. worry people can't get vaccine. think covid spreading people hate trump? People hate trump isn’t anything coordinate federal disaster response intentionally fucking states actually try. Well deaths 3 per day average. perfect could come back best without island banning travel. going much worse everyone needs someone close die believe anything. takes people listen, we'll never able tackle problems like climate change - especially also kind people position power. fuck benefits lying death rates high

I believe numbers inflated, fact think they're underreported.

However, *the media* would absolutely benefit this. Texas really large military divisions couple put field hospitals. might able handle vent patients could non covid overflow. Anybody functioning brain hospital dentist appointment observe doctors wear masks hours end jobs. need experiment realize lol. actually part time gig Lowe's reached conclusion care customers associates quit months ago. told managers feel like Lowe's enough safety need job. Teachers school district actually protested earlier week, believe lawsuit DeSantis. I'm enrolling mine homeroom thing maintain enrollment home. School set start Aug 10,but they're meeting today decide whether push date back 10 days. huge mess. feeling enforcement severely lacking.

It's going take something like someone's grandma hospital change public mood. Well, clearly financial resources so. (Though given ignorance display post wonder how.) empathy people luxury quitting job staying home?

I feel incredibly sorry children, ""homeschooled"" someone ignorant you. (Ironic believe White Houses' lies WHO..) Btw, birth control works, try sometime. hospital ICU bed staff man it, refuse ICU transfer requests neighbouring hopsitals. Texas prepared surge beds converting PACU beds ICU beds, talked lot weeks ago, silent subject staffing. ICU nurses difficult train. reports ICU nurse take 3-4 unstable patients assistance non-ICU nurses. normal ratio one one. Non-ICU doctors reportedly responsible ICU patients. can't keep giving ICU staff patients. Sometimes people insist learning hard way. crazy hear people say , oh we're gonna get wear mask time time, masks bad you, much worse flu, media hyping cause like Trump (who tho). dumb imo, even already it, I'd still wear mask sent example. get like this? stop loving other? weird me, I'm goody goody anything, be. care neighbors, use alittle common sence see lifetimes global health situation need change habits better everyone else. basic research dude hilarious. reddit geniuses can't even figure out. I'm pulling shit ass, read people community saying. There's literally much info PCR tests people calling even funny. Scientists. Medical professionals. send fruit swabs tests never run get returned positive test there's something funky test. ""It's CDC's test bro"" lmfao. again, PCR tests never meant used mass scale testing. Millions people die go route Yup, 
The State premier full-face veiling belong free don’t think anything right-leaning people Absolutely true, US’s pandemic response largely driven administration. something nature needs led top coordinated manner. fact one bad governor endanger efforts states better governors populations made sacrifices protect public large exactly needs coordinated top. Governors can’t close borders, can’t really protect states populations others. also can’t print money. don’t power federal government weather crisis.

Unfortunately administration neither leading giving state governments resources support need cope. free healthcare! loves seeing name things, keep calling that. :-) sates like Maryland. Acted early mid March. Opened two previously closed hospitals. Stopped elective procedures. Moved non covid patients rehab facilities. never got overwhelmed. 

It takes good leadership right start. hope states like Texas Florida remember time vote. 

I predict going see massive shift next 4 years elections.   thinking US daily cases starting flatten off? not? I'm currently trying eat storage local outbreak restock fresh dates national waves used minimum CFR we’ve seen, hospitals filling up. another comment said range 1800-5400 day. That's point. warmer weather Sweden can't factor ticking warmer place like Israel enough people dying yet? 1k day US still farce you? Oh, dont get wrong, well, maybe way said it, believe many countries made numbers lower really are, mean, cmon, lady florida fired refused exactly proof enough, trump stating ""slow testing"" lol. Btw, im usa, im mexico problem shitty president, actually, think it, almost everywhere look at, theres shitty leaders, except europe ""surprisingly"" lot asian countries too, say ""surprisingly"" given stereotype us gives asian countries.

🎵And home knaves 🎶 Lol, district Texas said require masks long legally to. that, explained guidelines recommended... legally didn’t follow them. won’t be... effort make school day normal possible. Lunch cafeteria, buses running like normal (2 seat), 30+ classroom, 5 days week person, recess PE good go.... nothing. 

In fact, start football 11 days.

Our county currently surging hospitals crowded. every school right... 4 schools (like mine) fucking up. Ha. maths ain’t great. it? ask ”why? me?” answer simply is: ”🎵’Cause delta airlines life fucking nightmaaare🎵” Even mask nonstop yelling, one things spreads virus agressively. France isn’t, Christians do” Pilgrims Americans English. America country national identity exist another 100+ years big Catholic family never heard this. living Protestant-land think enough issue actually wiki page. seen first hand mean exist. like covid.  Y'all come back now. 'it would've worse nothing democrats charge' U.S.A U.S.A U.S.A! think thanks. virus managed, can't eliminated. Also know proportion actually actively socially distancing would help reinforce importance staying fuck home need think Shareholders! That's Cory Booker 😒 much wanna bet people kick fuss abortion. saving it’s life stage eh? you’ve made 70 years - oh well cya! 🌝 They're they? Instead explaining truth (it protects wearer) headline blatant lie. think we're mentally challenged. 99.9% businesses US [small businesses (defined &lt;500 number chose arbitrary.

FFCRA applies *all* public employees default exact reason.

That's usually come line address holes. problem bunch shit heels controlling Senate want actually help Americans they're absolute bare minimum (for them, even rational people) telling millions people lives livelihood largely expendable. taking long vacation turning back? fucking idiots think would happen oppose every attempt control spread virus? feel bad people Texas triage conditions. ability access medical care dependent upon many years good life left, save all. What's even worse research field. work Ebola regularly actually suiting go COVID work discussion. He's seen viruses action close, soon political family starts agreed-upon theory, falls line becomes nothing another parrot. literally astonishing. realize 2% American soldiers died World War 2. say 1% like small amount already 1/2 deadly ww2 we're near done COVID Rookie numbers, town quadruple day. mean information. Lol. Hunger preventable. see anyone arms people dying food eat despite wasting throwing away tons food every year. worst hit state cases, end story. highest rate infection? No. highest mortality rate? No. worst hit state today. Full stop. company thinks heat kills virus doesnt want everyone go get tested someone gets cause would interrupt business oh told cant spread asymptomatic anyway nothing worry . Also someone dies God's plan time anyway. virus stay guys .  grew FL, Texan 25 years now... running tally would win stupid trophy Abbot DeSantis. DeSantis wins wide margin...

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people value intelligence country. value arrogant people talk lies make sound good, l’m tired old Etonians/Private schoolboys running country virtue Old Boys’ network, instead actual skill, support media. ask random person street Asia would much successful. find least crazy thing come with. worked hospital medical records worked medical coders. Hospitals write craziest shit bill insurance companies more. Example Urgent care would doctor “review” charts bill doctors name. doctor never meant actually read patients chart. signing name allowed make money. another reason healthcare shit business designed help people. That’s great point. I’ve worried flu Covid fall States, may bad social distancing. I’m glad hear getting break it. know really bad flu season last year. pervasive. I’ve people tell this. hospital admins don’t fill cdc checklist don’t attribute cause death. Literally millions millions individual clinicians do. think EVERY doctor nurse country conspiracy defraud government lying covid funds? Yes. answer yes. They’re insane. scary blasé Trump towards pandemic. He's completely ignored ""second wave"" states. doubt he's impression they'll find vaccine/treatment election he'll act he's saved day That’s said. thing wrong people already taking advantage. weeks ago working retail, experiences like confirmed workers--they'd come without mask, tell store policy wear one, they'd tell asthma/some medical condition prevents wearing mask, tell order online/out store, they'd start complaining saying stuff like human rights violation that. customers threatened sue, manager want deal shit, let whatever want.

If make mandatory, would absolutely reason ANYONE wear protective gear kind. busy day, 3-4 people like come in. lawyers legal advice forums debated could potential violation human rights (denying genuinely sick person basic access public places even private ones they're wearing mask could impede health). easy argue people right set precedent thing. people genuinely problem refuse wear masks benefit recommendations, people bullshitting (and would rather wear mask all) would forced wear least face shield would go hassle getting doctor's note. true could get fake one, fuck's sake least they're wearing something.

You can't imagine scary people try deliberately get face. I'd much rather spit land inside face shield.

Also turn anyone okay wearing mask, slightly reluctant, use face shield. can't make face shield easily home, someone genuinely problem take trouble order one. someone's asshole, policy like tell another option choose follow that, rightfully deny entry, burden proof lies establish medical problem. Someone check see studies got federal money drug studies enjoyed it. Keep trucking. bioterrorism, seriously grew Republican. Everything personal responsibility, able take care right thing.

It's crazy Republican party turned exactly told Democratic party was. though?.. science everything have, think it? big Catholic family never heard this. living Protestant-land think would. 

Anyway it’d like saying Pilgrims weren’t Americans shit. Cats OG might another go people don’t wear masks Except is. literally invented standard alongside 3GGP. Everything touches turns shit. may started China cause shitty response last several months. Thats 100% us all... begin high school football. 11 days. crazy. Viagra checking survive can't really survive pseudo opening either  Mah constitushinal rites!!!!!!! whatever idunno There’s way democrats win enough seats rewrite Constitution give Biden powers. 

The federal government doesn’t legal authority issue national lockdown. Changing presidents suddenly give federal government authority. also names cities: ""St. Louis along Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans Pittsburgh"". picture looks adorable happy. President start sending federal troops he's unhappy city's COVID-19 measures? ""I like numbers are"". wish totally sarcastic, BTW. saw video...way short. Studies shown 30 minutes needed see changes dissolved O2. basically like media cried wolf. wolf finally people listening? think see inevitable shit show fall winter going be. note, would asshole start freezing meats stocking non-perishables? covid first hit area, 2 months empty shelves. Can't imagine hard shit hitting fan come fall winter unironically. That’s outright lie. We’re many per capita Iceland, Singapore, Australia, Russia. given caseload still aren’t enough.

Testing strategy almost entire world using, test, trace, isolate. Again, impressively wrong everything. Actually, get tested 3 days exposure, odds false negative 70%. ideal day get tested 3 days symptoms *onset*, odds false negative falls 20%. See 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" It’s worst timing. worry father especially immunocompromised chemo. course cancer kill him, coronavirus sounds like particularly nasty way go. Japan he’d safer that. Things really getting control US. Texans could have, know, worn masks themselves.

Something something ""personal responsibility"" Republicans like spew. mean, planning scenario would differently federal government now?  Helped based what? hard knock life us Wow really summoned perfectly... Thousands dead here, Ted Cruz decides harassing billionaire important. Fuck him, Abbott, Cornyn. understand, /s mean? real, starting wish could seek medical asylum elsewhere even means locked weeks make certain I'm carrying it. made mistake. thing still know death rate long term effects thing. Estimates true death rate based confirmed deaths antibody studies point death rate 0.12 1.1%, anywhere quite bit worse flu upwards 25-30x deadly.

But even address people reported never regaining sense smell and/or taste, significant long lasting damage lungs organs. know percent patients problems.

Additionally, let things get control happening several parts country currently, people able get medical treatment problems due overloaded healthcare system. already expect see massive spike later people dying preventable diseases capacity routine screenings things certain places.

We still much time cautious. grew DFW, where's John Wiley Price screaming city counsel meeting need him?

Same Austin, Alder screwed first quickly learning... we're Abbott'ed can't believe govt actually decent thing live around apparently... I've seeing ""School #unmasked"" yard signs everywhere. employ millions people. miss mean people won't.

There still people need travel, sometimes living situations temporarily disrupted cause people need take out. think they're unnecessary mean are. It’s people gonna die soon anyway /s absolutely recognise dangers covid possesses fact doctors writing deaths covid still happens, middle ground know covid super dangerous precautions need taken still wanting covid deaths recorded properly, everyone jump one side other? NZ remember SARS1 news media talking pandemic plan, basically boiled sealing ports entry waiting blow backup slipped past tasman moat. OFC recollection media reports many years ago. yankee style.

Stick big burly dude front favoured weapon choice, AR-15, ENFORCE masks entry.

**The Ministry Social Affairs Health Institute Health Welfare describe corona situation Finland stable. Last week, 40 new cases confirmed, level previous two weeks.**

Some new cases belong chains infection known clusters cases monitored. Authorities closely monitor new cases chains infection.

The reproduction ratio currently 0.55–0.95. This means situation still stable, even though trend fewer fewer cases slowed down.

**More tested - 90 percent recovered**

During past week, tested compared previous two weeks. The proportion positive tests still small.

Finland registered 7,372 cases covid-19 328 people died suites virus. In last 24 hours, 10 people found infected.

Almost 7,000 estimated recovered, total 6,920, ie 90 percent confirmed cases.

According statistics yesterday (Wednesday), four people cared covid-19. None receive intensive care.

**3 million cases Europe - 15 million cases worldwide**

According news agency AFP's statistics, confirmed corona falls Europe exceeded 3 million.

Russia, Britain, Spain Italy hit hardest pandemic Europe.

The United States continues confirmed cases - nearly 4 million Americans confirmed infected. The United States followed Brazil India.

Over 15 million people worldwide tested positive covid-19.

Europe highest number deaths continent. Oh they're definitely snowflakes alright, massive hypocrites aswell

They're ones panties twist someone decided wear mask went ""view"" “Coped” past tense? It’s even close over.. already info? listened neighbor last night go covid hoax. 

These people stupid, dumb. God sucks many idiots loud voices country. think utterly failed state slogan.  Yep...Westport rd happens science denying republicans charge pandemic. Yeah thinking thing. find get sick twice even close Thankfully that's true Reddit. real world, live normally much want nobody going arrest me. needed study this?

Lmfao!!! Source? what's going happen, covid economy violence. 

It's par republican course would clear federal response. Cancer preventable desease, Covid is. France, economy restarted everyone goes work. Taking appropriate measures social distancing closing festivals mean end economy. true lockdown would slow economy, ways exists. Prevent 1000 deaths day restarting economy co-exist. people Florida plates it’s cheaper register car Florida think. people Florida past year. see time NY. 34 years life I've spared chicken pox, influenza, allergies. Hell, even common cold. Also never received flu shot, pox. I'm 16 years adult life also spared fever. 

Are saying never chickenpox, vaccinated it? really get vaccine, chickenpox adults lot serious children.  someone actually reinfected, first case lasted whole month March, second one came went 4 days. guess, live PA, complete 4 month shutdown area(Lancaster), month reopening, back normal, I'm surprised county seen spikes though, great. Make sure stay inside cower like good NPC.  You’ll make good laborer Democrat Kamps. someone also reads lips hearing damage, need understand whole lot someone saying perform essential functions shopping. always ask someone speak louder speak slower well.

Lots world normal pre COVID times travels routinely runs situations extreme difficulty understanding people without hearing problems.

Anyways valid excuse person hearing problems **not** wear mask. easy enforce. Act Actually show care yourself. handles people Thanks! thought control. thought great job. thought time open everything up. thought time send kids back school. miserable failure. I’m happy don’t live US. version “discount”

Edit: accidentally wrote instead US Yeah. yet another round ""FAKE NUMBERS. LIES. REPORT REAL NUMBERS!"" unfollow news station. rate &lt;1 *Most* ones I’ve seen die younger 250+ lbs. skinny people die young. One skinny 31 yo major comorbidities like ESRD (end stage renal disease). see someone coming 250+ lbs, don’t feel good situation try best treat good possible may last contact world. Internet weaponized lying PR firms driving armies bots amplify spread posts liked generate. 

People still get it. lot crazies real lot real. Holy moly. That's long away close hot spots extended periods though. 

For need social still buddy families also carefully. large events though, 1 2 families. Statistics falsely reported fake news media 78 USA, expect live 10 years more. Expected lifespan 78, birth. individuals expected lifespan increases year dead.

You need look tables like Uhm, no. course not.

It mutate like viruses.

Hence vaccine, make one, pointless. I'd say 80% people I've spoken given virus believe bad is. I'm already beginning hear FLU worse again. I'm losing hope us all.  Tbf early trials Pfizer shown evidence produces stronger immune response well. COVID counts swab even things present could’ve primary source death? We're embarrassing.

Sorry rest world. Thinning herd, isn’t bad policy. Back March, quarantines PA first started, like, oh yea, definitely back school like May, almost beginning august, almost 100% sure college going going fully online get housing payments students.


I made decision stay home commute classes person, stay home not. Atleast saving shit ton money though, like $8k housing, dining, transportation, etc. say kids time mask set example wearing one yourself. Another horse shit mask article. article say valves N-95 masks effective preventing COVID-19 spread, specifically compare something like surgical mask.

The whole point mask stopping spread infected people 1. Catching particles fabric 2. slowing exit velocity particles. coverings work degree none 100 percent effective. 

But real data slows spread, help prevent wearer catching Coronavirus, perhaps even reduce severity infection wearer minimizing viral load. Yeah, said reminded it. Pedantic much? per week agree more. I'm American. Health care country afforded rich 

My best friend stay home Mom. husband 2 kids managing OK plague hit. lost insurance, work while. told $3000 per month get health insurance family. hell think average family get $3000 health insurance? rent much! SMH completely control.  Fauci long history serving U.S., wrong various things make statements ordinary people need wear masks sure knew would help.

For me, flawed expert. hope testifies truthfully advocates increased best practices, etc..

There alot shit leadership go around U.S.'s response, top down. much could done sooner. much could done still done. Twilight Zone episode, seems. doesn’t musk shut arrogant pie hole. asshole. never told November. go. went trending Twitter too. Honestly, us idea. smart ones staying inside watching Netflix. Everyone else appears acting like Officer Barbrady ""Nothing see here, move along people"". Rutgers already said majority online so...yeah. ""western"" countries. NZ super fast successful response, Germany high population number, high population density regions living standards usually equal US. fields better, worse.

Not saying western better worse, ppl relate to

Germany basically theoretical image USA could done proper response. much YMMV statement depending US are. state, business restrictions still place many people still either unemployed working home traffic continues much lighter normal. one day week office, see freeway window - normally crawling stopped hours free-flowing morning long. 

I doubt saying true area, careful applying nationwide. Even broken clock sometimes right Half time can't even keep bullshit straight. They'll talk weak virus people die from, five minutes later they'll go conspiracy involving China manufacturing kill Americans 5G kind similar nonsense. part dead start line streets...

and smell mid summer heat...

&amp;#x200B;

Oh yeah...history repeats compliments 'human factor' (a stupid hairless talking primate delusions immortality) doubt there’s single non problematic luxury brand, fair. also despise rumor “I two friends went filled paperwork line long left. Two weeks later got call told positive”

No don’t didn’t. I’ve heard anecdote multiple sources either two friends popular motherfuckers planet it’s bullshit. 

It’s interesting it’s always TWO friends makes sound credible since surely couldn’t lying witness get phone calls fake results. addition response, non-COVID related ICU needs. patients go? Oh. per week got plants crave.

It's got electrolytes. Odd. associated maniacal laugh others. would've thought grandfather told laughing awful things happen. several waves masks stopping mandatory. IIRC final loose July 1st. Currently back pretty much normal situation wear masks anywhere apart locations like underground train Prague several local areas covid cases rise. Baltimore closed indoor dining bars, suburbs yet should. dense mother fucker. respond inquiries. I've heard, Sweden composed two halves northern half one day snow. know, thing happened NYC Long Island. decisions actions need investigated scrutinized. vaccine isn’t one now. governments aren’t waiting elderly sitting vaccine—to suggest ignores monumental efforts put forward scientists around world. Ah yes, loved ones contract virus themselves. Seems like great plan. 

/s 

Edit: seems folks don’t understand “/s” sarcasm I’m implying anything person quoted idiot suggesting they’d get better care home loved ones. It’s fucked got level, however warning (Italy) choosing treat turning away dying folks going happen. opinion, dumb fucker made masks political thing stopped caring enforcing social distancing rules got Texas point. Perhaps should’ve set site hospital situations like Philly, New York, New Jersey beginning knew going go. Sending someone home die way we’ve told folks die (unquestionably horrible experience witness, given accounts I’ve read) undoubtedly infect rest family? That’s solution. solution should’ve thought hospice centers could’ve set take burden families. 

I don’t know anyone else, couldn’t put mom room die alone food, water, compassion. would inevitably care passed would likely come myself. don’t PPE even hospice workers have. Fuck sake people, said one idea bad doesn’t mean want hospital take someone 99% likely die person much higher chance recovery. One possible thing think washing hands maybe? know I’m household things, cleaning preparing food, hands get washed lot more. .. still infectious. people safely care loved ones corona? Two different parties.

**EDIT**: .... mistunderstand, could give shit Spahn gay, really like Lauterbach. What’s now? done April. sane leader brain cell would have. guess 15 cases soon 0 sounded better. ""if continues?"" mean, he'll continue hurts financially. change fact meant crap. 

I'd never buy Tesla. There's tons great non-problematic premium luxury brands soon roll wide EV portfolio. Consider that. Quick, repeat me...Person, Women, Man, Camera, tv.

I need make sure super smart believe conspiracy theory. Sir hospital got like 60% excess deaths here. death reporting identifying exactly like testing data reporting, absolute fucking joke. Brazil 2.0 come. Actually bud deflating numbers Trump doesnt want testing done, everyone afford US tests.

&amp;#x200B;

So...if anything probably nearly double reported factor Idiot charge cost test. best friend growing up, mom aunt ICU nurses. They're highly specialized. basically keep someone alive artificial means they're able recover, recover.

Shut air travel. Hospitals overwhelmed refrigerator trucks bodies used. far situations US, lockdown happen. see states do. It’s flu season Southern Hemisphere. Yeah fuck Region 59% !

That’s massive...  Yeah, public health perspective, fight like respiratory virus (e.g., social distancing masks). resource perspective, problem, initially overemphasized ventilators misjudged need things like, say, dialysis machines.

Its blatantly obvious numbers far higher reported. 'president' openly spoken numbers would lower stopped testing. child's mindset....and leading cause issues there....well...that lack education spending. Incredible.... x13 official numbers per latest reports bet islands Puerto Rico US Virgin Islands only. Lol. Christian corruption conservatism. one who’s diagnosed coronavirus reported died day realize God killed Egypt first born, torched entire cities, turned people pillars salt listening, oh drowned entire world one point.

So yeah, believe sort thing, virus well within wheelhouse. Im sorry, USA thinks like this.

&amp;#x200B;

Its blatantly obvious numbers far higher reported. 'president' openly spoken numbers would lower stopped testing. child's mindset....and leading cause issues there....well...that lack education spending. Incredible.... Actually, reason hospital used red tape get people it. need wanted transfer people there, make happen. RI stores still closed hospital, Florida, diverting weeks now. We're 100% ICU capacity. ER admission waiting list. looking hours hours away hospitals take patients.

In Texas, areas dozens ambulances idling hospital parking lots waiting bed. We're yet.

But I'm worried we'll August.

Some Texas hospitals sending patients poor prognosis home die beds available.

And politicians really seem interested everything power stop this. F\*ck Osama think fatality rate exactly? think final death toll ""just goes away"". 


I claim said, ""nobody dying"", implied comparing regular influenza. Covid 19 10x deadlier influenza. Considering us told return work site quit jobs, choice camp, homelessness leaving small children home alone.

Tell high mighty one, sending ones kid camp make stupid? It’s illegal leave kids home alone don’t work, kid doesn’t get fed housed Lmao 80 days people mostly never know it. feel bad americans... 

I ran sympathy several weeks ago. rascist, virus hoaxing MIL MI haaatteeesss Whitmer. told even know corner incredibly lucky strong governor actually cares people. husband live Florida. Well America horribly fucked party.

It would one thing essential worker income needed....but party. fucking delusional idiot. I've two people close end ICU b/c COVID mid 50-s late 40s. fucking joke. Also stayed shut beginning longer strict masks everything would closer fully operational again... economy would recover, idiots making asinine stupid comments like this. guys think god damn smart farther truth. countries done way better us plenty examples places completely recovered better US. Japan example never exceeded unemployment rate 2.4% whole COVID thing b/c wearing masks... looks like get shutdowns states b/c nobody taking seriously anymore. I'm fucking sick ignorance alternative information people spewing erroneous sources. answer question. Ireland reporting deaths patient Coronavirus Coronavirus, deaths? emergency hospital done March early April, too. $40 insurance great, insurance probably free. case still realized it, 9/11 excuse reason war terror. situation today sad fucked either way. put 9 10 group. ""no worries, worst country world, leftist european countries worse ! "" tomorrow officially sign whatever we're gonna do. elementary person 5 days week, middle school 3(or 4, I'll check lol) days school online, high school 2 days 3 home online. option send back ""full time"", enroll full time online homeschool year, enroll Duval HomeRoom implemented March. HomeRoom, stay enrolled school, get instruction home, option end grading period return face face. That's one I'm choosing. 2 options year, chance changing. 5 kids: 2 elementary, 2 middle school, 1 Freshman high school. Last school year first time 5 time bam, virus. say though. one thing learned this, TEACHERS GET PAID ENOUGH! Bless ones heart job!   OK, point confirms TX still enough ICU beds, counter quote DR. 

We don’t need media hyperbole middle global crisis. need objective factual reporting. That's say alien - Americans probably know someone like accept one way another. accepted part culture, much minority people like that. quick figure [7% Americans handgun carry permit holders probably responsible gun owners. [*extremely involved firearm offenses, violent crime, felony matter. That's lot people, like every person carrying guns bars drinking. 

That's really irresponsible gun owner met; basic carry course tell alcohol plus gun means pretty much automatic conviction manslaughter. Lol sub one switched places thank informed prepared thing. I've able spread word least people, thanks fuckers arguing stuff.

So, effect, I'm forever grateful forum like this. Try going Twitter Facebook getting level useful information.  maybe think they're shit? Good try tho new average age C-19 death? would stuck, too. simple fits nicely paradigm already know accept. different leadership, though. Freedom! (To die sidewalk.) 2020 hindsight. time reasonable conclusion based little know thing air-born. 

You wearing fucking mask February. live Asia believe it, work healthcare. move. Nothing holding here. act like stopped something. it. #1 cause death vote busy day. Sad, true Administration even though hate working Vaccines record pace .

Things mess right everything 'Political Gotcha ' including lot said here.

BUT Vaccine works months - released record time.

It probably 90 99 % effective ..

BUT -it [ VACCINE ]will politicized work ones already Covid 19 say work ....and go on.

THEN - Joe Biden gets elected - see figurehead Radical Democrats try turn USA pre communist country.

So aware ....

Biden real - office less 1 year elected continue figurehead.

I wonder using Antivirals lessen severity Covid 19 [ cure lessen amount severe cases requiring hospitalization ] wait Vaccine ].   protected cells contagious think. still got contagious cells think that'd bad think might mean contagious even vaccine no?


Also they're finding people asymptomatic sometimes long term effects.

Edit: sorry like dumbass commented read article. go talking about. Yes cells might make virus less severe could still contagious. RemindMe! August 15, 2020 Floridian, c'mon. Regular Americans suffering badly right now. would like neighbors refuse use common sense government FORCE return work beside them? 

That's situation many us. wore masks. stayed inside. still lose.

Then get internet see thousands comments stupid are. 

It's incredibly disheartening. cough type asthma, breathing mask uncomfortable, easily bearable short periods. even long periods doable, though miserable. nearly miserable get spread covid 91 though Yup Always trumps fault, fault people stupid understand basic science, fault people went bars. enough information tell people things, lets blame president because, always, god forbid blame PEOPLE mistakes.

Always need blame politicians corporations.

And get voted, honestly ask (not particular ""you"") know something, people seemingly don't. really political leanings? honestly going say one side make bad choices side not? point individual say digging grave, politicians damned wrong say increased testing detecting cases?

The CDC researchers reported 10 24 TIMES many people likely infected reported means every case reported, 10 24 others found increased testing. cases would likely otherwise never found b people sick showing doctor hospital.

So true increased testing finding cases, also severe i.e. lead far lower rate hospitalizations fatalities. Yes. using mean average, wrong. shouldn’t use mean represent averages exponential distributions data. don’t know don’t get it, suspect may right. used inappropriate type average. assume people actually equal difference lifestyles due primarily factors outside control. 

This untrue.  exhausting dealing people America, trying run country racist obstructionist albatross neck.

But hand, must exhausting terrifying actually one people. live world small fragile, believing entire planet get you. much misplaced anger congressional district center Earth yet probably $450 savings account. Vietnam fuck around one bit thing. They're basically living normal life squashed reply ""didn't know anyone died 9/11, must fake"" one willing do, comes kaboom? late. panels already assembled parts country. feel people making tough choices due irresponsible leadership ignorant state? It’s coming people wear mask, practice social distancing (which really physically distancing), practice proper hygiene. It’s coming stupid. talking about? major European soccer leagues back now, champions league resumes shortly. may dumb playing games case counts have, sports back basically everywhere believe we're seeing thing positive tests. We're essentially testing capacity takes weeks get results. heartening! Shout Brazil really mean children quarantining tiny uneducated brain? you’ve seen children? 😂

Are sure you’re american? education level would minimum suggest schooled America....  where'd move to? would need explain logic behind question?

Thank sources. can't read atm, get around tomorrow. Thanks well researched.  'trump could done save us' always surreal read. nature help ppl responsible, ever. trainwreck god awful sociopathic response pandemic never surprised all.  politicized elsewhere different ways.

We anti-mask protests limited handful crazies like be. said, interact roommate all. self isolate two weeks theme park trip (didn't even go get groceries).

My friends largely living life normal already. thought silly isolating outings, wanting sit 6 ft away them, etc. couple already it, guess can't get again. rest think they'll eventually get whatever. Well dude mentioned obviously good plan. Ya pandemic want good plan. going teachers support staff force school reopenings serve fabulous appetizers landlord sheriff come evict banker come seize equipment. Ay 412 himself. Ya, addd to. cluster summer trauma season beds decreased due country fucking selfish refuse wear mask me, me, me. I'm pissed state low instances cases tourists fucked hat up.

I collapsed lung march warned doctors use lung space often possible risked lowering lung capacity due atrophy (brain meltdown, may wrong word spelling) real point matter do, increase baked it. people die next month already infected. let's skip decide need two separate countries.

Every mask counts better don’t give isn’t perfect.

I mask wearer.   Never heard BNO.
are like response OANN? tangible data regarding IQ town. I'm currently 1 ""degree Kevin Bacon"" 2 infections 1 fatality.

- friend's father got sick 2 weeks getting better.

- wife's aunt sick home 11 days, nearly dead hospital 12.

- Another friend's uncle got OK suddenly got bad killed quickly enough nobody even chance say goodbye.

It's matter time kills someone know well. Interesting read thank you. think heart disease cancer deaths lower 2020 may died diseases caught covid? Curious numbers work that. He'll die heart attack hears 'rights' people shouting, ""heck no, mask, heck no, mask!""  shit Sherlock outdoor dining may work weather like San Diego San Francisco year. 100 degrees yesterday - that’s going work summer places either. Someone literally said majority people covid deaths going die anyway liberals classifying covid make trump look bad. fucking stupid ignorant people Ya know. Worried putting sort tracking chip in, make small enough even worry about? Biggest issue anyways virus mutating. Making work couple months sedatives induced comas unfortunate people. peaceful death it’s idealistic expect family stick care them. 

All could avoided. Well, fair. need one sanding can’t find Canada either.

Using old mask instead. blame shoe fits facts Texas earlier surge. takes month best death numbers start rising reported. 

For hard communicate staggeringly large number is, let alone ongoing figure. Alternate title: we're tests alot covid deaths regular deaths nothing covid find dont bother go back change think handled comparatively well Germany, yet over. Question long-term morale less strict, still 'annoying' measures hold. particular things *will* get worse places. Germans able put discipline again, without panic/fear instilled first wave hit? really hope, bet yet. Motivation tricky thing... Typical poster sub. worried engaging propaganda attempting follow science. 2 week incubation period symptoms would started 5 days ago. Still another week wedding guests start seeing symptoms. kinky, choice!

/s  Exactly. MSM thinks works, attributing US behavior places, nowhere worse handling this. Certain people get still holding notion (for US consumption) US tops, truly sucks. mean this, question adults behave.

Theoretically plenty decent mitigation strategies requires capabilities willingness things right seem either. Two points:

1) others pointed out, would stretch say Hippocratic Oath (which largely symbolic) demands physicians put avoidable risk. One could argue working unsafe environment harm good takes doctor commission cannot treat others.

2) experience nurses (and none ICU nurses) incredible dedication patient(s) front right now. seen stand ground doctors administrators family members believe jeopardizing patients (and nurses clinical judgements almost always right). makes very, hard get walk midst dangerous unethical situation. watched awe back April nurses, finished 12-4 hours nonstop crisis management pick pickets demonstrate front hospitals. keep telling people deniers go work body trucks new york, pays reallllly well. depends plan have. choosing insurance plan want pick one fixed dollar amount pay year. lower plans often pay 70 percent so. Even 7k year sound like lot, way better paying 30 percent million. framed *murder*. vaccine developed Oxford distributing different vaccine
Edit: ain't bit early deals ready.. wait till evidence bigger trial Also intended allegory movie. That's literally said. American United, meanwhile, stopped social distancing booking flights capacity. 

United First Class also seen casually disregarding mask policies passengers. 

I guess content delaying killing pets, actively trying simply kill well. 44 states seeing rates increasing, according Reuters. sound rude, but.... duh?

We US ones dumb enough try sports virus still active. Winning! think businesses governments mandating way go forward. I'm worried hurting someone else themselves. Fingers crossed immediately increase emissions again! go. live tropical island coast Madagascar. eradicated Malaria using know drug dangerous would wiped half Africa country. even need prescription go Africa. Funny think China really ready... Frickin Reddit logic behind saying. said something ridiculous April. Georgia experiencing surge July southern states. What's correlation? get point, we’re already fucked. “How fellow drug users?”  ? prefer articles make apocalyptic dooms day. also like jobs require 10 year experience something 5 years. wont satisfied till know 2 years data 6 months.

Accepted knowledge: Shows picture Lysol SEE says corona-virus. Flips open high-school biology book. common cold.

Edit: I'm saying things bit virus far aware. Look incubation rate first. wild ride. Jack's complete lack surprise. Ironically chains like Applebee’s fine. It’s corner cafe neighborhood bar helps give live character gets wiped out. Geez, wanted hang obama two people died ebola.

Obama trump... game changer! News broken UK Monday seemed get lost vaccine updates came later day. never gotten point. example example. making mistakes again?

Poor survival mean can't saved. saved. He’s laughing cause turtles immune Covid 19 we're prepped reopen schools fall. According 2018 census, roughly 76 millions students enrolled United States. obviously every state district going approach differently, lets say sake argument green light every school country. That's 76 million kids back class, K-12. amount children would catch virus pass catch students onto parents family members, death toll would enormous. 80+ year old obese person dying COVID exactly compelling reason lockdown everything.

EDIT: Wear masks, heck gyms shut down? care 99.5% all? 3 generations alcoholism going deadly COVID. Agree. say, teach undergrad — hybrid online person — syllabus says students allowed wear valve-less masks. Even valves send air “down straight out” it’s difficult know virus actually end up. even risk harming people? Doesn’t seam worth it.  Jesus Christ, godspeed you. evil ignorance people awful. agree, almost like panic attack feeling arent breathing head. moments feel cant get breathe, theres oxygen air. watch chest inhale exhale. Chest go up, chest go down, ok, must breathing then. confirmation breathing issue subsides minutes. Prior terrifying though. going send back nursing homes like New York Michigan did?!? Wheat chessboard problem...

If chessboard (64 squares) wheat placed upon square one grain placed first square, two second, four third, (doubling number grains subsequent square), many grains wheat would chessboard finish?

18,446,744,073,709,551,615 (eighteen quintillion four hundred forty-six quadrillion seven hundred forty-four trillion seventy-three billion seven hundred nine million five hundred fifty-one thousand six hundred fifteen)—about 2,000 times annual world production—much using formula based estimates many fewer folks driving, going office, vacationing, general travel/movement. Obviously we've opened up, activities occurred again. 

From graph shared, theoretically, locked virus (so basically fun would awful) back March/April/May, expected death line plummeted time frame would less traffic accidents, less people means less things like homicides, viruses COVID would less likely get passed around pneumonia deaths would well. fact remained expected deaths cause concern signal deaths undercounted, overcounted. done right before. That's point. blew it.

Stop talk, take action. Shut throw proper money resources schools keep everyone safe. that's they're doing, I'm sending kids. They're elementary school I'm single parent, well high risk mother living now, like exactly easy keep home.

Government says every kid computer internet. Well make happen too. Throwing $600/wk unemployment thousands dollars every household, yet can't provide $200 chromebooks students need force ISP's provide free basic internet. One. certain current occupant house Pennsylvania Ave gets it, severely. One comes yesterday. can't use numbers last two weeks, final. Best say case counts maybe 6th July. I'm you...mofo lies everything he's going rather hard one. One could hope Florida Texas reconsider vote for... two options. said glad win nearly 4 years in. Pretty fucking clear me. Good try tho. epiththelial cells? Democrats ever encouraged looting rioting, protests [did cause spikes think comprehend dangerous driving is. That's problem this, people understand risk. Every day, make decisions could end death. That's part life. value child's life less drive car. Likewise, value child's life less send school.  Ah well that’s fine well isn’t oath doctors take get license. 

But gives fuck oaths, honesty, compassion act like sociopathic empathy free asshole Reddit.

You’re edgy. aren’t like girls, you? want make money, cure - maintain it.  pretty close across board, places Democratic leadership mostly taken responsibly, stayed closed longer, slower openings, stronger pushes people wear masks social distance places Republican leadership pushed hardest close anything, closed, open back quickly aggressively possible, pushing hard possible make sure people take safety precautions.

This partisan issue, unfortunately, is. strangest damn part side obviously wrong every way best position take control, powerful, protect us one chose make partisan issue. Looks like Trump finally released alternative Obamacare. keep doctor life. don’t answer that, I’m photographer, virologist. Good theory, no. easiest explanation usually correct. Trump simply a: narcissistic, insecure, emotionally immature, intellectually uncurious, compulsive lying &amp; bragging, buffoon, man child, horse's ass. literally gotten us banned leaving country foreseeable future whole world see infected, ignorant, garbage fire US become. fucking ""constitution"" needs re-written. 7-1

Researchers discover Corona's ""Achilles' Heel"" - breakthrough? Several drugs could prevent reproduction 

Have scientists finally made decisive breakthrough corona research? results several studies give hope.

The corona virus firm grip world. still vaccine Corona. Researchers discovered ""Achilles' heel"" virus. could mean breakthrough fight virus.

Munich - research * coronavirus * finds out, chances way found stop it. latest discovery international research group even said revealed “Achilles' heel infected cells”. molecular biologist Nevan Krogan University California San Francisco, headed study, put journal Cell. special thing it: researchers' experiments, seven already approved cancer anti-inflammatory drugs prevented proliferation coronaviruses.

As Focus.de reports, researchers describe able identify pathogen's trick enables move efficiently cell cell: this, forces infected cells form tentacles whose shape resembles spaghetti . tentacles (technical term: filopodia) carry newly formed viruses pierce shells neighboring cells. pathogens penetrate resulting holes previously healthy cells.

Research corona virus making progress. weak point pathogen may discovered. © Hendrik Schmidt / dpa experiments, seven drugs prevented multiplication corona viruses Krogan: “Our hypothesis speeds infection. eerie evil tubes, viruses attack several cells once. ”Based observations, researchers identified seven drugs experimentally prevented virus multiplying. However, biologist Carol Reiss New York University, involved study, warns rash joy: study carried monkeys (vervet monkeys) transferred humans first.

German researchers find possible way combat virus multiplication Researchers Germany also made new discovery virus. Scientists University Munich Ulm University Hospital presented results Science magazine, deal mechanisms coronavirus attack. known long time virus paralyzes essential parts immune defense host: protein production ribosomes. this, uses viral protein abbreviation Nsp1 (Nonstructural Protein 1). Nsp1 blocks entrance ribosomes machine stops.

The researchers Ulm shown causes important line defense virus attacks collapse. findings could help combat Corona, authors hope. example, molecule masks target Nsp1.

Whether international team researchers German team successful first, science finding virus every day - hope findings soon lead vaccine. (cg - * merkur.de part nationwide Ippen-Digital editors network.)

Edit: studys mentioned article:    Okay thanks clarifying that. instead 146,207 Covid deaths US, actually 146,206. Also want point spelled coronavirus wrong church sign. Exactly, turned 100% political, yes virus kills, many things. media wants Americans believe they’re “educated” reality heavily influenced cannot think themselves. hey, least McDonald’s 3 miles away? America turned shit, every way possible. Weak minded people. cannot sing every time see it. Trump's fault. needs answer this. claims swedish. says sweden also slightly higher death toll compared denmark Scotland. asked 5000+ deaths counted slightly higher claimed use excess mortality. 

But looked profile corona subs, posted shit like ""we lost 5000 grandmas"" probably worth go further.

Sweden used excuse especially conservative circles justify stopping shutdowns claim shutdowns bad. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* “They trying hurt Trump’s re-election chances making numbers look worse!!!” Heck even “right-leaning” conservatives Canada generally speaking left democrats U.S. Holy moly. absolutely understand gravity it. wear mask everywhere (but car). want schools reopen metrics dictate acceptable (am teacher). go stores all, stay public, socialize etc. etc. 

I believe science data come out. see politicization accompanied EVERY piece news Covid. 

I see about-face Trump masks (ridiculous, hypocritical, etc.)

Your comments (ie: ""Tldr, dumb wrong."") wrong America. Getting emotional divisive going change people's minds anything move things forward. Texas California starting plateau, Florida hand still fucked. vaguely remember seven. mostly remember skin hands peeling over, over, think couple weeks. wanted play Nintendo hands raw burned hold controller. agree. much agreed idea protests standing happened, people say protests effects plain stupid trying fit everything narrative. outside get. reopen schools pulling gun someone asking wear mask, crime. AmIright?  Assault crime world, right? drawing firearm, deadly weapon, serious offense Penal Code Section 417 following 4 elements crime took out, exhibited drew firearm, deadly presence another rude, threatening angry manner, or, unlawfully engaged fight acting self-defense defending another person. 40% country pre-existing condition results poor outcomes Covid, story repeat America. Sad part used national obesity call people obese young vibrant, young healthy. wise man told me, ""People make lot bad choices good ones."" people get sick, choices face like American presidential election: potentially calamitous outcomes matter choice, however well-planned.

There quite places managed properly, strong traditions social democracy, largely instituted following invasion defeat course WW II. true east west hemispheres, oddly enough. me, there's striking correlation victors WWII--the nations never surrendered ended dictating terms peace--have arrogantly inept pandemic management: UK, Russia, US. EXACTLY saying kind crap gonna start happening due peoples stupidity kept getting bitched fear mongering. Geez, sorry trying make funny comment. looks like vaccine way we're going make world travel acceptable again. really hope make mandatory travel know anyone, that's told him. days beginning last week told. plays worship band, whole band ended getting sick except him. Ah yes, old ""other things problem, problem."" 

Honestly, still answered question. call small percentage, people whose job cost analysis death. months people suggested economic consequence lockdown pale comparison threat cost mass hospitalizations would cause. 

Literally every single cause death ""minority"" people. still take efforts prevent things. 

You know what's bemusing? Thinking there's global, unified conspiracy take away freedoms, doctors nurses tell exactly fucked is. fucking knuckle draggers reason America shit job this, matter bad gets states, there's new excuse, new conspiracy ready, new deflection.

In NY go work every day, shop want, travel want. wear mask it. I'm extremist think am, I'm calling schools stay 100% closed new lockdowns anything. 

I'm fucking piss baby convinced know value truth 140,000 lives better countless experts common sense dictates. extremist, opinion built foundation assumptions, hypotheticals, conspiracy theories. get play pretend people actually deal reality pandemic. 

Go hard hit hospital tell they're fear mongering. Ask care missing children. I'm sure walk head high, indignant, sure yourself. live Maine, incredibly fortunate highly populated states around us responsible disciplined. healthcare resources deal pandemic, we’ve largely spared.

And it’s people Maine particularly good wearing masks socially distancing. see lots maskless morons here.

So I’d like say thanks everyone NY right thing. guys saved us. owe enormous debt gratitude. sacrifices vain. learned respond? know death rates fell successive reemergences Plague, never knew why.

And work? understanding Black Plague Yersinia Pestis (Bubonic Plague) spread fleas (which essentially became rabid actions bacteria) traveled mix populations rats, infected themselves, immune. event, impression transmission direct person-top-person, mediated rat flea behaviors. Yeah California becoming worst hit state rn watch happens deaths two weeks know love it. earlier fairly rampant problem (March - May) sometimes body noticed coronavirus killed trying respond (the called ""cytokene storm""). health care several strategies help body avoid response, fatalities dropped almost non-existent levels people 70.

The news every day young person died COVID. One news articles week new Minnesota mother. live MN, ive watching MN stats like hawk. July far we've literally lost 116 people, 90% 70. media picked story one TWELVE people 70 die state 5.8 million people last 3 weeks. mean... understand public interest story but... think case best report outliers.  never happier American. [...] Canada

But technically *you American*. scientific language write **US**-American designate people USA. Also, someone else posted, Medicare paying COVID treatments hospitals shift focus treating Covid, treating Covid brings less money hospitals typically focusing on.

Example used would hospital bill car crash COVID billing normally ends much expensive COVID treatments. ventilator/ppe vs surgery, anesthesia, various drugs, ect ect. argument even make sense matter way look it, usual. don’t think you’re subject comment. recommended. clearly stated save N95 healthcare workers. Please provide link anywhere recently stated N95 masks would unhealthy general public? may true don’t see anywhere said. 

As I’m sure know there’s science homemade masks specific em test different. Omg, that’s where’s coming from!? Yup reason good 40% country still completely moronic racist enough think Trump president good idea.   calling Norwegian expert liar? He, I, many Norwegian journalists, many Norwegian public, etc, etc, etc, heard Tegnell say thing presser. think rather can't hear said spreading misinformation cover yet another gaffe Tegnell. countless studies articles stating protests driving factor. Wow horrible. sure showed us opening early neighbor Texas Tennessee bad drive hospitals nearly empty, plenty beds spare. understand government paying bill right? can't wait see GOP proposes transfer taxpayer money donors time actually working cripple response virus killing 1,000 Americans day. solution moving forward? Maybe India's numbers highly questionable. claim 25% population virus. \~350 million people. Even using lowest mortality rate estimate 0.25%, equates 875,000 deaths. India reporting \~30,000 deaths. either severely reporting deaths, antibody test insanely high false positive rate, virus mutated significantly less deadly there. Friend mine Jersey City said thing months ago. Tons sirens day long. Imagine comparing India US ... people really think Trump deploying federal troops Portland Chicago protests? Lol no. They're testing waters setup ""poll protection"" intimidate voters like GOP 1981 Governor election Roger Stone adviser governor 1800 votes. DeSantis: ""You're welcome"" Man, opening schools absolute nightmare. Yep, totally master plan.
Let's put life hold, hell ratchet back bit (a lot) good measure.

Just fuck America.

Yep, got us! 

Damn cranks. :/ instead simple requests right thing community, get actual laws real enforcement mechanisms.


The people skeered Satan's jock strap 5G LTE antenna gonna throw tantrum. wait till schools start back up.... soooo fucked Current economic indicators suggest people helm agree this. That's... Actually problem. Entirely. types decisions personal responsibility. stretch make hurting society, pay health care, end governance person.

Too fat? Hurts society. Smoke dope? Hurts society. Go bungee jumping? risky, Hurts society.

To types people cherish myth ""rugged individualism"", type thing scares crap them. ""Your easy have, get passed around america faster flu"" love US run prisons like business shit, run hospitals like business shit, elect guy says run country like business. 


There reason popular method... true.. NY first getting hit, message white house literally wear mask. get amen? Trump 2020!!! problem is, defines solely opposition others. He's like child want something suggest opposite thing. makes think ok *you* decide *me* get normal life flu? simple. costs lockdowns physical distancing far, *far* outweigh beneifts lives saved flu. Maybe governments could ask (*not* mandate) people wear masks flu season particularly nasty becoming socially accepted COVID that's it. 25% strong arms weak legs. They're also rich money inherited parents spend well wonder going run out. Except many could infected morons responsible, even though everything prevent spread. 

I speak experience, aunt, luckily 44, tested positive last week super careful.

 illegal irresponsible that's anti-science jerk-wads. Sorry rant. Brazil catching us. knew something remain #1. They've moved onto ""It'll gone November election"" worldwide conspiracy. sis sent article, really hope shes ironic doesnt think legit agree. I've read bmi 30 increases risk. see bmi 40 greatly increases risk. must much fun many friends Yes, exceptions, couple hours chugged 2/3rds gallon time avail, briefly lowering mask chug. surge new cases started month ago now, Republicans stock promoters said ""but death rate still low"" covid diagnosis results patient risk death next day.

Covid-19 takes 2-6 weeks resolve either recovery death. simple
Our country never truly capacity respond way needed (contact trace, Ppe, help congress), trump exacerbated problem. isnt root cause what?!?!?!? sigh...

Well, *Swedish* study clearly can't trusted right? /s ridiculous feel like ignore international scientific consensus matters. Sweden here, I'm getting impression alot countries reactionary rather trying proactive preventive ensure infection burden stays low. countries mandate masks anything preventative data finally shows it, creating unnecessary level future burden.

Sad true. whole Nordics. even really explicitly said several experts Denmark days things like 'we get mask regulations fall cases increase'. silly. happened Australia, I've evolved TTI key must mandatory TTI + masks now. One slip-up mistake creates cluster hard become uncontrollable without masks Melbourne shown..

Exactly. Masks + TTI + NPIs (distancing, handwashing) always best way go. remember [this TWiV Dr. Ian well said: one people modeling said know need put people facemasks everybody go back work tomorrow. said “absolutely not, that’s crazy! first people don’t know use facemasks right so, know, fiddle really sort obviate whole purpose secondly don’t data support know conjunction they’re important. 

It working together effective possible. disease controllable coordinated leadership, personal responsibility, minimal amount compassion use non invasive PPE. America never chance. recently put sign entrance doors building work say masks required least first level upon entering building. also put giant (and mean giant) stickers elevator area lobby say 2 person per ride maximum elevators. People still walk building ride elevators without masks. yesterday saw 2 people get elevator already person it. people ignorant pieces trash. isn’t going get better time soon Well, charge.... maybe DO. ANYTHING. Good Board Education. reason rural place like unnecessarily hold kids back pretending going next NYC. Pretty much point, edge September stupid. Labor Day. schools do. Except wasn't. lying. tends that. 

The CDC gave specific instructions going count DIRECT causes death. body suggest otherwise muddying waters. 

There proof DeSantis claimed ever happened ever will. Comments like Reddit sucks. Almost every second comment top comment half assed joke, easily derails real conversation. county California definitely adds case data day person tested. means takes longer good data visible, prevents testing delays permanently distorting case growth signal. didnt know consistent practice Yes, really. live alternate reality bullshit even begin think otherwise. total complete incompetence administration are. Note one authors (G. 2 months ago Bette Korber Los Alamos published preprint paper Cell showed SARS-CoV2 Spike gene D614G mutant basically taking world pretty much wherever went, subjected evolutionary positive selection. particularly prominent Europe time. Critics however said could founder effect instead. increased importations especially USA could explained addition second mutation ORF1b gene P314L almost always present viruses Spike D614G was. one could easily distinguish making virus infectious somehow spread faster. first BioRxiv SARS-CoV2 paper show direct comparison Spike glycoprotein 614D Spike glycoprotein 614G latter infects \~5X better original virus first appeared Wuhan making mutation increased infectivity explanation likely. tough day first author first presented result lab meeting story appeared NY Times (not Biorxiv journal) website Scripps research Florida essentially result ... crazy times normal publishing norms upended happy see first author (Junko Ogawa) fall prey made sure everything right rigorous result put BioRxiv first result 3 labs shown essentially result last month say cut corners much add clarity controversial remaining aspects. addition lucky funded Danielle Fong. Without support none SARS-CoV2 work would possible Waiting go away like miracle promised. Considering twice many people died July total yearly number flu related deaths, still think misguided understanding severity. Things also getting worse, better.

And daycares actually close temporarily many people infected. Maybe read more?

*edit It’s also difficult quantify deadly kids schools open full capacity raging infections. America determined lead country deaths, even it’s kids. Tbf less people Kentucky means less people vote McConnell. We're middle pandemic Trump poured gas fire of, middle fascist takeover US Trump responsible for.

Not mention Trump previously try buy company purpose securing sole rights US.

So yeah, actually pretty relevant Trump, even not, forgive us top mind almost contexts, watch destroy country every day. Broward Miami-Dade exempt awhile they're original hotspots. experts say containment would extremely difficult US point due extreme amount virus spread across entire country, thick south west. impossible, we're worse spot country/region since started. Basically order contain (without herd immunity vaccination) would need take extreme steps including locking hot spots, numerous governors made clear happening. AZ's test numbers vary much day day hard tell case trends. positivity numbers still super high

Today: 2,335 cases / 10799 tests: 21.6% positivity

Yesterday: 1,926 / 8,005 tests: 24.1%.

2 days ago: 3,500 / 15,133 tests: 23.1%

3 days ago: 1,559 / 8,477 tests : 18.4% go restaurants, Beach, gym, supermarket, inside gas stations, friends houses. also went trip west, flew ways, stayed multiple hotels. didn’t stuff March April believe experts back then, actually still semblance credibility. activities, guess what? I’m getting sick, neither anybody else that’s know. IMPOSSIBLE come contact virus least once. 

Those us live states things much relaxed concerning virus see reality every day: people live normal lives get sick virus long immuno compromised elderly.

What people sub need realize, talking general specifically towards you, requiring people remain locked outdated point time. It’s necessary either. Health officials, doctors, opinion it’s worth shutting whole country save lives elderly people. Sorry, rest country doesn’t feel way. left economy open, asked people wear mask social distance, think moved indoor dinning outdoor 

No lock whatsoever heard SARS (I think related covid) created long term effects lungs, heart vital organs (pretty much failure organs much younger age earlier expected patients’ demographics). concerned covid May end like viruses causing cancer organs similarly HPV. read parent comment youd understand I'd figure  Whew, good thing hoax, would *awful*. ^^^^/s time kids starting pulling fair share numbers honest.

/s Consistent messaging?

 This!

Before took wild turn. sure thinking (hoping) selling Maga masks would appeal supporters (and him) everyone would board mask wearing.

But forgot 2020. Instead became conspiracy. People showed guns shouting rights (and wearing masks violated rights) people started attacking wearing masks.

And result. really sad. It’s sad elected leaders taken strong stance mask wearing. Profiles cowardice. disputing facts article? report 28,087 confirmed cases children 282 hospitalizations. Hospitalization rate defined number hospitalizations confirmed cases (not estimated number infections). simple math results 1% hospitalization rate. agree, (and multiple listed) I've heard lot testing rushed, I'm curious safe effective vaccine given usually take around 10-15 years. Imagine Kemp indicted interfering two different elections. posted - curious anyone new info? cannot find any. high blood pressure, medicated controlled. still high risk group? see plenty data HBP underlying condition Covid deaths, untreated cases? Medicated cases? Even medicated, heart still stressed out? likely blood clots? confusing. 

Any personal stories anyone HBP survived? trouble finding those, either. True. 300k dead next prediction incredibly optimistic. already 1k deaths day last 2 weeks arent even seeing big death numbers lag case numbers seen July. Sorry, I'm confused: mean 80% country voted Clinton 2016? It’s temporary solution, certainly sustainable permanent one. They've said area awhile ago. need others same. People openly traveling traveling what's open meaning, Orlando. Pass holders (obsessed ones) idiots. absolutely way back comment. California boat except governor trying something millions people giving shit. Fuck we're stupid ass country. absolutely cannot believe watching Italy NY go damn thing!

Unacceptable. mean thing fauci saying weeks months? Birx.. political failure health expert. trumps voted expect birx removed overly proud country far largest military world, worry we'll get desperate way? see going far worse got truly desperate. way avoided situation.

/s Please joking. Thanks, notice put wrong positive rate xD accidentally put state positivity rate without proofreading it.  knows, saying one actually gives fuck it. “This evidence help put rest previous reports possible association blood type higher risk COVID-19 infection mortality,” Dua said.

This bull-s**t. Holy shit. NYC never real lockdown.

Plenty places considered “essential” BS reasons stayed open, plenty people still going non-essential (read: non-life-threatening) reasons.

The US simply isn’t capable true lockdown never was, we’re paying price country. lot reasons. CDC specifically recommending beginning certainly help. 

Also much support think president Trump come clearly enough soon enough favor them. campaign giving long time ago.

BTW, look Iran hostage crisis alive understand Carter lost. speech help main reason. Considering Sweden high degree failed shield vulnerable populations, herd immunity strategy looks rather grim. Clearly, don't. means eating near people especially high risk avoided possible (and generally possible). Eat home. Eat car. Eat outside. Find somewhere else be. eat restaurant. classic examples answer...

I hold many people responsible current mess US finds in. Fauci however pretty consistent messaging talks sense interviews briefings. ignored government mean made right recommendations.

Just looked post history. would say opinions they're often ridiculous. use hotels motels temporary hospital rooms. ideal travel supposed minimal. Pay $75 night rate room, rent every room put patients there. Clean close hospital standards can. Hell, even put fence around park put tents like temporary camp. instead, nothing done. That's dems skipping unemployment fighting pandemic UBI right now? Well Kemp wants another Trump. He’s savior.  health insurance really bad. meet deductible starts paying anything. thinking fruit loops T-Mobile +338,000 users /s That's still tiny sample size mean apart fact sources reposting article minor media outlets? pure bullshit. Sadly Reddit anything New York California may well exist bringing ""good parts"" country.

So many people even realize Democrat governor, even better one actually great job term. Even pandemic making better decisions COVID Midwest. Unfortunately rest politicians seem hell-bent overturning anything state local levels. reading recently colleges keep building, bonds due. become business education. thought money guaranteed every year recognize talking point. ""both sides"" argument yet another lie, another deception. Kemp’s moron worships Trump.  Arby's disgrace? tourist dollars equate need achieving immunity is.. becos shut hurt state economically unemployment claims rise again
 We're fucked. Oh right. long stretch time there. Bro even saying lmfaooo fact isn’t 9/10 makes lose faith fellow “freedom loving” countrymen. 

Being selfish doesn’t make patriot. makes asshole. probably sugar it. Driving joke hear even think crazy me. I'm happy you. Floridian 12 week old can't go anywhere Im jealous. country in? approach seems letting Whitmer take heat nationally following lead 48 hours later. lot counties refused enforce governor's orders Took 20 hours Virginia. smallest ounce proof would good.

If anything, hospitals would report numbers Lower, higher, order people still happy come elective surgeries.

Them making people scared, therefore keeping away, goes best interests. going around telling everyone vote every single republican office upcoming election, including Trump himself.

You fooling still think one second republicans Country's best interests heart. fat orange shitbag turned political identity feel like they’re fighting civil rights. care economy people , closing everything make "" big guys "" lose money That's really flattering photo tbh  first thing came mind.

Although it’s much American logic “/r/coronavirus logic mid March” guess. It’s doesn’t even matter think anymore. along ride mess. many people selfish. ""A months"" either extremely optimistic extremely pessimistic.  stand original statement omg, that's... can't done accidentally. They're hiding shit. Old people tend die younger people. That's moral statement. course *deserve* live, mean power make happen.

With old people, way prolong lives, even though identifiable cause death (whether that's flu, norovirus, Covid) systems cumulatively weakened age comorbidities. 

That case every death but, some, matter mitigate Covid, would mortality figures soon regardless. time first wave, number people category particularly high. give super high death rate. ‘Hardly anyone Covid-19,but fatality rate 79%’ completely stopping virus, slowing spread. seatbelt doesnt save 100% car crashes yet people wear saves u percentage car crashes. Who’s actually letting government stop sex though lol Sounds like government would start incarcerating people kind illness. Someone know mentioned they’re saying it’s asymptomatic. means it’s contagious symptoms it’s good. Since you’re going die anyways. counterargument younger kids spread rate older kids do. there's study suggest that's true. sister 3 year old it. niece mild symptoms ok sister body head aches. spread father law sister. oxygen tank within 2 days showing symptoms. sister might need hospitalization. People take seriously obvious? vaccine comes? mean, find super offensive (maybe should) that's origin point, accurately describes US Flu now. explain difference? worst nightmare virus itself. negligence governments laziness people make hard contain it. 

The pandemic preventable January politicians health authorities paid attention. still possible contain society get sh!t together. Well, we're called breadbasket America nothing. (Read: millions acres wheat, lead nation. Corn soybeans eastern part.)

And, many good people (I try one them) contribute good things society whole. give one helluva good college basketball team (KU Jayhawks) one leading veterinarian schools/research centers nation draws students around world (K-State). 

The downfall, part, comes center US, insulated. People tend largely uninformed global events foreign policy. one biggest things recognized living overseas, coast US period twenty years. Now, I'm back Kansas since Tea Party took Republicans, shit show. family seventh generation Kansan (we still *Kansas Territory* stretched way Rockies) breaks heart watch what's going on. accuracy! started epidemic giving personal appearance, basically wearing pajamas, stress baking cakes every day. feel compelled day put full makeup even I’m leaving house. I’ve started exercising multiple times day. I’m eating healthier intermittent fasting. EVEN STARTED WEARING BRAS I’M HOME OH DEAR GOD HAPPENING hard wrap heads around 140K+ deaths means. put terms easier understand: 50 planes crash kill everyone onboard every week, four weeks, that's many people died COVID USA. read article coming conclusions. Obesity rates common comorbidities (T2D, high blood pressure, asthma, etc.) young people probably help. they're give in-person bar exam next week 500 people Birmingham. Masks required sit down. Amazingly health department state allowing proceed. think agree. included, least I'm cautious. barely left house four months. saw bar graph day Coronavirus deaths think WWI WWII, ahead everything else. Can't find link, though, remember criteria. (Was worldwide American deaths, example, else included?) vast majority accidents happen small residential roads, highways. Large roads high speed limits much safer 2-lane side street stop signs curves. 

I’ve driven across country multiple times. 45 would torture. never get board that, sorry. Germany’s autobahn much faster traffic anywhere US still fewer accidents. Speed one many factors. don’t assume road system good well implemented. assume came little thought hurt us planet many ways.

I mean, Eisenhower interstate system one biggest, safest stretches road ever constructed. built amazingly quick time period and, fun fact, interstates also designed used quickly military - like planes tanks - event land invasion. That’s interstate highways always well-maintained flow well. guess...the USA simultaneously obesity epidemic. Stress needs put two conditions together deadly. disproportionately take seriously. people masked early Asian followed whites. NY never reached point turning away critical patients necessary. Thats scary disease - variability. already idea, thought Obama gunna it. project much they're basically giving us playbook. people, yea jury still n studies presenting cases re-infection. example here

 articles/proposals/pilots canine detection since start thing, none ever seem go anywhere. They're saying there's ICU beds area patients would sent hospitals far away. Developing inflation fetish daddy trump said put hot air body comment says Spain, lol. Damn. Look first spike. control run. seeing fascist contrarionism working out.   exciting. Oh wrong there. plenty states gone nutz cases. matter time till see spread. ... much kids spreading ;)
also: autumn coming... thousands people going vacation countries, especially pay 50 CHF get stamp passport... happy times... waived apologize. anything really, say sorry. 9-year-old girl died novel coronavirus Putnam County, Florida, making youngest die virus state. Four children passed, health officials Wednesday, Florida Department Health reported 139 deaths state — 9-year-old one them.

Selfish...which every person 40 change allocate would given younger charitable fund make sure everyone family knows. Yeah, point less new, contagious cause death generally preventable. incomplete changing data overall IFR mortality rate possibility long term complications, would completely irresponsible ignore virus allow wash population unabated.

In addition, treating severe forms virus enormous drain healthcare system, virus attacks whole body destructive fashion. data far back Wuhan, severe patients ventilated many weeks generally required extensive care keep alive. It’s less untenable discussing large %’s American public becoming infected relatively short timescale. promise criminal bastard ever kept! damn sick winning! Get used it, live hillbilly state, grew online people asking wore shoes, wore overalls every day. take personal, FL one populated states, there's bound stupid people well, forget boomers. surprises months later testing still low. cant wrap head around this. Japan government cash strapped?

What commonly thrown around time government counting Olympics boost economy spending overseas, explained visitor taxes rise sales tax last year.

Though opinion, think lot corrupt bunch taking ""offers"" lobbyists. Given Modern Japan's common pattern following United States, guess things change much. Hey, tell me, I've union officer active member, I'm stating observations. Especially south, collectively stop afraid losing licenses, could easily control situation. though. one care dying relative quarantined area without exposing themselves? point. Their""financial motive"" would apply made money Medicaid reimbursements COVID19 patients. correct reimbursed doesn’t cover costs. doesn’t mean making money though there’s still shortfall costs (as demonstrated 2019 article) treatment receive back. Deniers need address this. I’m talking BIL feels conspiracy.  realistic force mask baby entire flight. There’s special baby masks readily available.  Played stupid game, stupid prizes. 

Perhaps people stop stupid?  ""ahh finally sleep long day slaving corporations""

*Getting Windows ready*
*Please turn PC*

""aaaaAAAAHHHHHH!!!"" realistic force mask baby entire flight. There’s special baby masks readily available. Well president bragging cognitive testing prowess. 🙄


What else say leadership United States right now? sad part people dying probably ones fault spreading. Land occupies 29% surface earth. majority earth, covid even problem. Stop making you.

^/s do, Trump way electoral college system. enough Americans voted beat regard. popular vote mean shit, still presidency. Please hope virus spreads. Many places camps still families dependant child care. curious precautions taken? outdoors? Groups less 10 limit outbreaks? *Rusty Shackleford entered chat* love Olympics would japan right ugh I've learning logistic maps Hopf Bifurcation lately, wonder growth rate cases applied this, instability data case counts result certain variable growth rates? wearing masks shutting way prevent existential exponential spreading?

Here's study predator/prey disease spreading relates found this! Lol. joke. decade ago, nothing masks. Loser. Go troll someone else Ik, media helping either BS  New Zealand part eradicated virus. South Korea control still cautious.

Sports without fans sports live spectators. No, became really contagious almost ventilator. SARS-1 cases easy isolate could infect another person, that's reason managed contain it. happening over. wife got test fastest turn around time could find 4-7 days (not including rapid tests 90% accurate). days wait time get appointment. 2 weeks still results. Garbage system. USA! USA!
(Photo guy third place giving everyone finger meme, since bot wouldn’t let post here.) I’ve yet hear single person sharing love working Lowe’s praising treatment workforce. It’s universally negative far. workers don’t wash tend real “winners”. kind weird self-perpetuating cycle loathsome employment practices. Calling circle jerk would imply least someone getting satisfaction it. Play golf catch covid, either way you’re working handicap. love we'll slap ""Good News"" literally anything. 

GOOD NEWS! Man thinks magnetic bracelets cures headaches says making bed every morning strengthens immune system, knows helps reduce COVID symptoms. realistic mask baby entire flight. Thats why. 2 year cut probably cutoff. can’t punish parents 1 year old kid cant manage keep mask properly flight. flights still ongoing fucking mystery though. sad. government needs start really stressing deadly obese getting covid be. gloss it, appears stresser lot young covid19 deaths. like making horsy sounds moving horse around.  federal government decided outsource testing problem instead supplementing capacity providing surge capabilities.

We paying government trillions dollars taxes provide advice criticism.

Dr. Birx, concerned testing delays, reach CEO’s Labcorp Quest ask federal government help expand capacity. deploy FEMA test sites hot spots way Larry Kudlow claimed happening. shut fuck up. understand works, you?

You've made claim, asked provide source backing claim. 

You can't say ""science"" think claim valid. need provide source back up. may want read source article see second scenario even actually statistically significant factor (it isn’t). also want argue raw numbers look excess deaths 2020 counted CDC anything deaths undercounted. Either way funding people treated probably treated Covid-19  socially distanced speaking podium away crowd, would wear mask? would weird. think mingled crowd. Protests contributing factor, far bigger one people gathering restaurants, bars, public places. 

Many towns protests, almost people eating restaurants, drinking bars, etc. (outside select locations shut indoor venues). don’t really disagree point. say unintelligent people likely potential intelligent lack resources actualize potential. believe individuals culturally relevant positions ability (and respects responsibility) materially assist enlightenment folks. Also, get virus, wearing mask makes likely it'll less severe case. didn’t say it’s fake asked question. literally saw discussed sub months ago. 

I don’t understand ask honest question people assume answer beforehand. not. I’m genuinely asking. subreddit always pulling numbers asses lmao I’m still going anywhere. would never get passing someone died. would feel terrible. feel terrible give someone common cold.  alcohol served. Stocks going up, value dollar going down. ask ""who's paying extra money?"" small amount logic remains crashes right wall.  wear mask nose Totally. feel bad lot people. Athletes train whole lives opportunity Olympics possibly scrapped entirely. Even college grads went school 4+ years didn’t get walk stage front friends &amp; family real convocation ceremony. Weddings got cancelled postponed indefinitely.

It’s okay mourn sad special moments life won’t happening anymore/were cancelled. funny! fuck expect?

wait mean viruses side politics? They're something can't bully lie of?? Yes. thing happened wuhan Italy ran beds. close 15.... shit Sherlock, Cells practically reason adaptive immune system first place. Cells fucking badass. 30 percent infections ot looks like. bad florida bad race still on!  I’m discrediting argument, you’ve probably met someone HIV. US, 1 300 people HIV, it’s easy treat long you’re diagnosed. live quality life without symptoms. 

Also, isn’t real reason tell someone unless they’re close friend. There’s lot stigma around positive can’t actually give someone unless you’re sex sharing needles, it’s risk normal acquaintance. explain 'obvious agenda'? Yeah, heard lot businesses didn't. get ours, one first applications bank agreed it. think design, intended small businesses. big corps give shit though. DeSantis shocked, shocked Diet Dr Pepper tastes like regular Dr Pepper. child dying? radar stay top 10 countries highest deaths based population size bar owners protesting lol stuff gets done administration (like.. tax cuts) seem happen principle though. Trump care policy, laissez-faire lobbyist types whatever. case, think must gotten one message usual 'advisors' another one health professionals, defaulted follow rich buddies.

Note current state affairs disaster if, example, looking buy lots cheap housing land lords receiving rent payments. Exactly many dead children okay sake opening schools. Schools open germany. Opening schools isn’t problem. It’s way country handled pandemic far. Yeah, also damaged carry checked despite bubble wrapped small hard shell suitcase, asked could least put fragile tag like nope don’t ""only masks work"" strategy going there?  worse case scenario happening. friends elderly dad passed away last week mother fighting. 

I hated honestly, can't even normal funeral family friends together calling video.

I can't imagine feels people loose someone could situation could easily side. There'll cameos favorite stars / starlets. naked!

""Scarlett Johansson stands boys...and topless!!""

""Another priceless moment, brought sponsor - Mastercard!"" Exactly. It’s like rule class drugs doesn’t fit immediate logical profile remedy. Agreed! forget many enabling Republican Senators see presidency opportunity exploit power. Conservatives don’t believe public good. could even printed MAGA masks would probably made killing. people probably would worn them. people still want wear mask/think Covid exist. know oversimplifying things, need look many countries across world managed get things relatively control, even beginning return pre-covid routines, saying thing people generally. Mongolia, New Zealand, Taiwan particular kept harm pandemic incredibly low numbers (even per capita scales).

Obviously, major differences US (and Brazil India Russia Sweden) would need addressed, idea people can't come consensus shared well-being is, imo, way cynical. People easily get page need clear. question need ask many US (and especially many people power US) think need get page comes covid. rivet questions... Reddit: fines discriminatory! Criminalizing minorities poor!

Also Reddit: need huge fines wearing masks. 

Reddit: defund police! don’t want police enforcing non violent offenses.

Also Reddit: police need devote resources handing tickets wearing masks! Fuck conservatives

All pretend Trump's mad ravings legitimate side political debate. Got em Why? blame one thing Trump? It’s like individual states hands tied, enact mask mandates want. Well, *is* Florida.  It’s cool got hospitals, also every country planet, join prank. go another level. charge country’s response? 99.9% children fine?  Interesting. Yeah, maybe, call doc tou one, local university.  yOLo!

It's going make uncomfortable thanksgivings grandma. ""Natural selection"" Wholesale massive rioting streets happened

It's going to. economy gonna get worse. way probably wont count covid death happens home. called pneumonia something. That's rough. Good luck everything! Went design Google Android bot logo works cool! Take that, Sharks. Wait bribe way 50 CHF?? question implies ""how many deaths july?"" originally said ""thus far"" corrected ""in July thus far."" Still, writing. Yikes. understand Google needs word stuffing word salad makes terrible read. hahah yep, America always Number one! yay! 63k per year. cdc page show comparisons make obvious bad covid right Florida He’s busy invading US cities right now, get back later week? Kids going held back. system designed it. American kids go classrooms year get zippy education year. is. Soon parents realize better, guess. still cool Alabama July, right? virus spreads easier close quarters. That's exactly new, countries closed bars restaurants immediately.  killing people learned nothing New York.

Basically decided ""New Yorkers"" real people happen them. 

Didn't learn anything Wuhan either. RemindMe! August 30 chain strong it’s weakest link.  sweet...sign $999/year TV special! don’t see point would mark transition needing masks more. get new case rate back late april take masks, start spreading exponentially again. get safe effective vaccine, fauci think mostly eliminate like small pox. lot people seem don’t get it, really astonish me. Oh gotcha. makes lot sense now. Usually rural towns would safe place live pandemic, unfortunately many village idiots days. thinking Lucky Charms. account best. Still entirely sure satire actually governor though. ""To begin classes virtually, district must get approval state Department Education executive order signed July 6, Runcie said. order, enacted Florida Education Commissioner Richard Corcoran, requires brick-and-mortar schools across state reopen August least five days per week students, unless state local departments health subsequent executive orders say otherwise.""

You Choose begin school year Choose begin school year.

There *Always* choice, albeit popular unpopular, *is* issue.

Whether good bad subjective that's *another* issue. good record keeping necessary determine whether criteria applied absolutely evenly not. accurate data, adjust factors go hospitals doctors exhibit racial bias. ever notice people getting unemployment benefits fight temporary pandemic UBI all? often completely reject it. UBI absolutely DISGUSTS people getting unemployment. fills complete RAGE. said deaths would ramp couple weeks so, got downvoted oblivion.. lmao We've literally able see future b/c Europe got hit first. gifted Back Future Sports Almanac level visibility here, still fucked up. point is... EVEN argument kids aren’t real risk true that’s even remotely enough reason justify opening schools. Like even 100% true it’s still smart open schools interesting friends gone 2x love much!! beautiful country amazing people. Sigh. miss travelling. concern cripples children 

That ground glass symptom horrific ... yet August. read many stories Italy senior patients making similar sacrifices / refusing ventilator. Please safe! also immune-response suppresents. reading source incorrectly. specifically points lifetime chances dying ""one 608 car accident"". i'm sure got 1 500 18 that's clearly false odds would lower.

The odds dying car accident pretty high take steps realistically possible die become injured car accident, like I'm taking steps realistically possible protect family virus sending kids school fall.  agree shitting peoples beliefs all, comments awful.

But honored dedicating life faith? That's bit much. harm meant, even respect need desire base life around consider fiction, fact think really sad people feel like that, scared enough seek level comfort.

Openly mock? no. Honor? no. say that. said people unwilling make scarifice greater good. 

Rationing food war also difficult. people it. really believe today people would make sacrifice can't mask 5 minutes get ice cream? Abbott called National Guard assistance Comfort Mercy dock Houston take overflow?

lol GOP admit mistakes really think, protestes one major reason situation escalated badly, fooling yourself.  rate humans kill species, give time. Meanwhile NY notification sent moment ago:

[ From: Notify NYC

All New Yorkers get tested COVID-19. free, confidential available location near you: nyc.gov/covidtest. ] Ah yes, amazing red demons screeched Obamacare way kill grandma grandpa, now, need sacrafice economy, right? Really shitty situation sure, that's good doctor. free markets, supply could meet demand /s. :( sub mostly US posts None. bad though secretly wish they’d get least mildly sick learn lesson real? almost feel like going worsen behavior claim didn’t get sick (yet). Americans dumber rest world there’s nothing it? live house.

Still pretty easy ground 18 year old, especially things like cars cell phones names someone help make sense claim state run lab 144 COVID-19 tests period one month? missing here? Confirmed cases, genius. counting aysmptomatic. real Christians though according lot Americans.

Lutherian heritage: Luther believed Jews evil fell rumours ""ritual murder"" commited Jews time. catholics / Pope protected Jews unfair trials, Luther went claimed Pope ""Antichrist"".  that's nice. i'm also dual citizen. feel like knew terrible idea too. People dumb, highly contagious disease lot people gonna get without shutdown, can't eradicate even vaccine 

The damage done economy people lives, health etc etc shut far outweighs virus NBA, turnaround time 12-15 Fair enough, addiction, wanting quit change life step 1. cultural norm encouraging people accept celebrate fatness give self improvement it’s destined fail, changing difficult. It’s time start countering messages obesity ok. It’s dangerous something majority cases. Sad thing way telling long term complications children might catch covid. Shit, entire country way fewer total infections leading four US states (NY, FL, TX, CA) alone. 

So England, worst performing country european region; that's fluke. “WAR! #noarmor” Borderline fat ass. Yessah! 128 rough estimate serious? Toddlers basically babies learning impulse control express emotions properly. Well yea shit... actually wide spread testing beginning national plan combat virus... would probably position countries like Germany, Italy, South Korea, Canada, New Zealand name few. saw /r/CoronavirusTN thread says major delay reporting numbers yesterday 10% across board. 

With schools opened current COVID case numbers, lower amount new cases.....the in-school attendance required pushed local politicians. else would hotspot city/state magically delayed numbers days, going posting daily highs last week, school starts less two weeks, WH controlling numbers unmasked state?

I looked further, father's school system Tennessee *right threshold* requiring kids attend person. need cases reported order full-on attendance. 

I can't imagine plucky little six year old kid, getting overcrowded bus going school require masks.....unknowing whole time could witless COVID victim second. least coo coo. get it’s shock. it’s absurd people think threatening someone’s life appropriate response requested use mask. whatever reason obesity considered underlying condition..... Like what???? People claustrophobic. deal time. People phobias handled kids gloves. See, that's exactly problem. ""Don't go college want broke"" perpetuates two class society: afford go ivy league colleges get high paying jobs (aka 1%) cannot (aka 99%). fine janitor life grand-grand-grand children still janitors going life-long debt moment slip wet floor break leg, that's fine. lot people would like children better off. $600 week probably much rural America, probably enough populous big cities. compensation line paid unemployment. It’s common sense Clearly joke terrible Trump itches, send help.  say fake.

They reject evidence leftist plot. like 21 million. Maybe bit higher, think 4 year old daughter counted ""Thinks kids go back school."" zoomers called they’re selfish socially irresponsible like boomers were?   know Trunp technically right virus go away eventually. He's wrong ""miracle"" part it. He's right many people died virus struggle spread many people die America gains herd immunity. Trump probably fuck to. tactic derail meaningful conversation topic. ""Dr"" Brix fine it. 

But Evangelical, want world end. one pisses off, every single time. always answer back simple ""You're dumb fuck"". remembered five words. That's new record him! Well yea cancer super contagious relatively easy minimise. Sounds like they've always short curlies. 

Land Free, ass. owe AT&amp;T lot. ( say much last time posted got way many replies ridiculing family cell bill). company got caught with. 

Anyway, AT&amp;T great work promised spread amount due many future months. worked specifics yet rep told ""Don't stress AT&amp;T bill. Take care life priorities first. We'll work together future promise make due "" would admit true?

Come on. Zip put monster away, Pip (watch “Airheads” get reference) Gee, money eh? guess 20+ years paying taxes federal government means getting safety net UI deal.

Cvnt. Indiana great place *from*. think American public intelligent enough follow advice 'largely contain' virus, paying attention all. Trump's response exacerbated problem US, anything like 100% deaths attributed it.  keeping kids home. doesn’t mean think it’s easy elementary school kids work work home. I’m responding idea “just you’ve doing” actual plan it’s dumb people try figure it’s supposed work. last time school? Asking children follow protocols, even half capacity, next impossible. money come R&amp;D state fundings. Like developed countries do. Tape $25 upcharge many children tested, though? incident-hospitalization rate nowhere close 1%. Look mate. That’s using old noggin. It’s free country, eh? ... shouldn’t using P100 respirator that’s job? works hospitals area overwhelmed.

&amp;#x200B;

A situation entire Southern United States rapidly approaching. Im arguing dont lack education lack actual intelligence. Yep I’ll change it. 140k dead words: Please stay home Thanks! literally called people disobeying order belligerent. feel like agree people misbehaving this. anything Fauci overly optimistic time vaccine take complete. one that's true acne. jaw still puberty rest isn't. lol No. assume that. learn filter media usage properly listen experts directly someone knows please tell me! better America still it’s disappointing fruity taste shows.  would best practical approach right contain urgently? Mask probably preventive atm right least Cinnamon da winna-mon. south.. ha.. got tested 9 days ago Philly suburbs.. still waiting results, absolute joke  I'm really confused ""narrative"" think going pushed?

Because thing getting real traction calling 1 10 stupid. (Rightfully calling stupid) I'll little clear... live Cali, city liberal, see lot liberals conservatives wear masks, hence dumbasses sides. Within organization individual mindsets always adhere values ideals said organizations. agree extent. Conservatives much stupid compared liberals terms dying economy overall Static science? mean? Chemistry basis biology happen work pharma development. virus collection macromolecules replicating, especially positive sense RNA virus like this... 

Masks well understood loooooooong time. Unless claim kidding. joke. see many licks takes get center tootsie pop ? 

Find next time Dragon Ball Z  Coulda rebranded little. ""Make America healthy again.""

It's non-political (mostly) hard argue again, would worked. doesn’t make sense rate lot people going lose jobs can’t reopen correctly. I’m hospitality industry massive layoffs coming areas travel. Cruise Lines Hotels going get hit hardest end think part what's happening hitting multi-generational households harder, households tend disproportionately Hispanic. would seeing surges Florida, Texas California. 

Anecdotally, spend lot time sanctuary city large Hispanic population mask wearing way spotty anywhere I've seen. wearing masks covering noses. going public transit. 

I've seen couple articles multi-generational households coronavirus local news percolated much national news. businesses keep employees paid revenues drop dry up. able to, know business owners simply can't afford that. choice going business cutting costs including payroll, much do. Better keep company afloat hire people back side this.

I probably get downvoted this, simply true. everything keep people board, lose business it. Amazon Prime Germany showing soccer games same. actually bad. quite well made drone quite quickly.

When listen broadcasts, this, just..empty. would counter that? believe trumps way counter russia narrative. He's painting China worse russia, setting things blame loss China. He's going try invalidate election results based trumped bullshit China. 

Look embassy deal, that's part it. Expect shit like election. pretty sure trump wanted damage done US, could blame China shift narrative.  wouldnt been. whole voting base exact people resistent constructional advice. could come morally sounder before, virus total opposite everything trump. way may cost reelection regard kinda thankful last. *We* US humanity? comorbidity?

Can imagine sacrificing millions 7 year olds education one 9 year old died?

Americans good Math Stats. depends, assume never car crash, heart attack, allergic reaction, issue might generally bring hospital higher average census winter No, been, long. virus going anywhere, we'll live on, constantly watch, cycling strict quarantine looser one, least strict social distancing contact tracking. countries successfully dealt first wave already getting second one. still summer, going worse autumn. people still think one-off thing, deal stay safe forever? Without vaccine virus going eradicated, managed, way infectious compared recent epidemics. vaccine still years away, ever comes all. We’ll win eventually. claim protests nothing - I'm sure contributed. view leading factor, however. thinking Honey Nut Cheerios fucked Judging facebook comments ""iT's fLu"" wearing mask makes ""boot licker"" would thought would more. Universities bringing back students wanna deposit students' tuition money gonna blame students following guidelines there's outbreak. seems obvious me. Take money say ""not fault"" engineer’s human capital worth much working product, logistics, optimization, etc. talent pissed away executive role. Yeah ""Watch Apple Store Closures."" No, Apple stores watching numbers. usual doublespeak. truth except Trump saying right now, says today always said despite evidence contrary. People accept big lies little ones; lie much often overwhelms fact-checkers. Every time rational person simply can't believe absurdity saying, remember way beginning. whole strategy immune truth. Actually I’d rather die live dystopian new normal. 

A world without seeing people’s smiles, able travel see friends family live different states countries worth alive in.

ETA: hey I’m suggesting everyone outlook. outlook alone I’m allowed that.  idiots surprised this, literally watch shit happen Italy. Sounds socialist say. Hi there! I'm kid motor skills delays. Sure, teased able use scissors tie shoes. Otherwise I'm perfectly fine. Still 'clumsy' graduate degree, solid career, otherwise blend right in. help; started school 1979. I'm sharing wrote worry son wanted counter example. wish best family. shows positivity rate peaked couple weeks ago. 

Also, differentiate testing ceiling fewer people seeking tests due fewer cases?  thing though, agree need stress move. people, already late. plenty Americans part stay masked. I'd venture half. rest family get it? daughters friends get it? Spritz water comply. works cats. Exactly. rooted understanding statistics. Normal gaussian distributions need understood every citizen encourage participation modern society. 


Good luck ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Interesting. First I'm hearing it. still make much sense though, test results instant. could even headline like ""11k new cases Texas Monday"" announced Monday? 11k cases must results tests previous weeks. Funny area schools want open. wonder polled Yes. individual, rather entire districts, limited time, like week so, time clean thoroughly give people chance stop spreading it. unusual. is. Close unnecessary businesses pandemic control.

Everytime someone whines something reopens, takes longer. 

Any time spent complete shelter place orders less effective makes take longer.

These obvious metrics obvious since begining. millions die. cant that. need masks deployed everyone ans everyone step line this. health issue PR political issue..... Lmfao, watched cable ""news program"" state run media. worst fear I'm Texas happens get hurricane Houston floods, powers hospitals etc. Would disaster what's incentive continue essential work? Oh yeah, forgot, that's insulin 1$ marked ongoing health issue user needs dead. retardly stupid you? I've following almost month now, clear drank alt-right cool aid. Think one second main voter pool full of. advocating ok killing biggest pool voters vote consistently policies. 

There reason even core republican party wants take seriously. killing people. you... I'd real quite shutting nursing homes want schools reopen... want people go back work... want lose another whole economic job sector. 

I'd 100% fine shutting nursing homes. would safer everyone, put pressure GOP increase stimulus funds, another nail fail covid response. you? compassion end gets inconvenient? 

By way, good asking estimates... would care give estimate virus die out? soon right, since dying years season right?  still makes sense. Denmark, stopped outbreak, two months possibe visit nursery homes.

It's like strategy based fictional world. Meanwhile NM people throwing tantrums ""people live hospitalized here!!!"" planning opening schools. Looking Ronnie.  still won. record, also like him, I'm saying got voted end day. infact, unless put virus perspective it'll appear worst thing ever Can’t trust scientists reason can’t trust atoms... make everything! /s shit. That's exponential curves work. what's point making decisions based case counts evidence projections say actual amount infections 10 fold. What's point talking lockdown Texas projections say anywhere 2.1 million 5.2 million already infected?   Yeah, that's Oxford vaccine, one I'm eyeing even get choice. redeveloped SARS COVID-19 vaccine immediately gave 2 kids. Could mean crazy, could mean truly believes risks COVID worse option.  surprising, considering he’s stupid fuck. Okay isn’t perfect. agree premise would please stop treating trump way competent regards virus. proven many times utterly incompetent awful. Sure Fauci made mistakes, potentially unforgivable ones. stop moving goal posts. judging hard charge Fauci republicans fucking hung metric. article zero new information speculation. 

I'll take word though: probably cant get reinfected. virus causing potentially severe flare-ups 4+ months. Much better, right? drowning appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* It’s like majority people aren’t afraid getting mild cold. think it’s likely 10 times point  man. happened society stopped calling bullshit could live inside delusion ‘freedom.’ definite, toxic aspects American culture directly led let happen letting bullshit fester want know EXCEEDINGLY PRECISE NOTATION electron-spin molecule becomes molecule It'd pretty horrible.

I'm epidemiologist I've thoroughly read every plan schools near me. 100% sure single one consulted single public health professional. opinion. think good number people mask phobic. least cases resulted people catching virus dying:

Texas:(30 year old man dies admitting going Covid Party ""prove hoax"".) importantly, given many people actively online calling hoax, really think beyond realm possibility they'd derisively throw party mock virus? ...relatively innocuous behaviours like coughing sneezing experienced significant, dramatic, anxiety-provoking events. example, one participant, long-term cough smoker, reported feeling though treated like ""leper"" shopping.... Another participant, hay fever sufferer, reported feeling ""on edge"" going fear sneezing worrying people might think say.

Some new forms *other-ing* play covids. can't even begin comprehend many times exact comment posted here. unknown, literally exist yet. point downplaying 1k deaths day comparing one horrible diseases entirely different this. deaths going continue go up, ambit many could prevented.

If cancer contagious could prevented simple measures, maybe comparison would merit. number one expense people rent/mortgage well, so.... seems like businesses fine people are.   Well would rather party 'politicizes' pandemic (even would argue media politicized pandemic) one completely bungles response forcing nursing homes accept COVID+ patients results thousands deaths. states highest death rates? Literally came ""virus factory"" (not call I'm calling it) Wuhan much winning. Nature got tired it! think it’s likely 10 times higher, crazy think poorly handled probably experiencing relapse original infection then. people argue immunity might fade, don’t usually mean within month. Tests false negatives, particularly virus receded awhile. like said rarely left house. 

I hope feels better soon. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  frankly restrictions ""safe practices"" schools proposed fucking stupid maybe 10% better nothing. Non American citizen here, unlikely trump get reelected? mean Europe even think possible fucking win election - - know basically know nothing anymore even sadder attempts slow spread causing increases number one cause death well, others top ten list well. Huh, guess studies showing low transmission school kids areas low rates infection national strategy prevent transmission doesn’t translate well we’ve got going FL states. Ditto PA. live near large nursing home hearing uptick sirens eerie enough, closest 2 hospitals ran beds ambulances start heading completely different direction. good day figured going on. insane voted this!   less optimistic.

Even wildly implausible scenario U.S. saw 95 percent cloth/surgical masking behaviour.. suspect would late. 

Masking might enough, coupled aggressive contact tracing enforced quarantine, infection rates low. rates now, kind doubt even universal masking (sans serious measures, including lockdowns) would suffice push r0 1. Higher aerosol concentrations multiple infected people indoor spaces, etc. assuming even universal masking public translate widespread masking private meetings friends/family. 

And universal masking U.S. simply going happen, so.. there's too. read **Russ Hodges'** voice -""The Giants win pennant! Giants win pennant!” incivil reply. Please try avoid personal attacks. 

I find articles cruise situation DK, know much cruise landscape generally. Noted website wrong. Maybe situation similar, maybe search pulling much. Also, lot people getting \*enough\* even $600. made $4,000 year W2 employee, $45,000 1099 contractor, used $4,000 determine eligibility, cannot contest it.

Personally, 1099 worker decade, know anyone 100% 1099. $105 week UI payment came tiny $4,000 year W2 job 2019, even $600 add I'm making half pay losing housing. I'm pretty sure Fauci say something completely innocent normal, headlines freak whole, ""Fauci takes complete blame coronavirus US.""

Just like whole ""Fauci apologizes lying masks."" apologize lie masks. None relevance current situation COVID. I'd argue ""how"" address people forming completely different realities actually pretty clear many ways (reinstating robust form fairness doctrine across media platforms would good start), political needed take steps lacking. 

I'd also argue motivations behind disagreements works fight COVID may clear, they're also complicated, focus one two reasons (for ex. need keep paying bills people end arguing businesses need kept open earn money pay bills), end ignoring bunch reasons (a desire stop living world afraid talking friends family, desire look wrong, etc.), making harder get dissenters page. can't imagine company ran people blinded pure greed pour money finding vaccinations communicable diseases could easily passed along families. I'm really curious too, wish answer you! (controlled) high blood pressure due kidney disease, risk factors COVID...but kidney function still essentially perfect, BP totally normal days. basically assume peace mind I'm slightly higher risk someone without issues enough let completely derail mental health anxiety. amazing raging pandemic actual neighborhood change mind many virus hoaxers.

There’s growing speculation herd immunity number somewhere around 25-35%, since infections seem level go every city region world hits infection percentage. realistic seem? Also, never allowed admit data shows getting better? Based death rate peaked April MIGHT reach level again. slowly getting worse, large degree. now, things better were, say?

Total death rate yes. that’s past. right now, we’re arguably one best states controlling spread virus. book deals.

Imagine moment, young kid, maybe somewhat informed pandemic. Lets say kids teacher catches virus, winds hospital dies. Meanwhile, kid knows going forced go back school next day.

From perspective, anxiety situation nothing detriment forced classroom school year. think probably lot scenarios people decide they'll ""clever"" whip mask mid-flight. imagine goes down:

* Flight attendant argues little bit.

* Flight attendant threatens ground flight kick person plane person put mask back on. Flight attendant might threaten arrest-- flight attendants actually arrest okay captain (a lot legal stuff works differently air) arrest continue along person deposited back airport. 

* Pilot backs flight attendant.

* Person realizes ""air parents"" actually serious really turn car around settle right instant. 

A lot people with, er, ""behavioral problems"" flights settle realize flight attendants position power pilots back flight attendants. people think flight attendants sky waitresses. sky waitresses. finished first wave... one day, siblings, obese. Might well happen. article talking vaccine Wuhan Institute Biological Products/Sinopharm began phase 3 trials recently. one Sinovac Biotech entered phase 3 earlier. Funny that's case. Cuomo, Murphy, CT/PA responded opening incrementally. Florida TX horrible examples follow someone thought hoax recently wore mask. Yeah, keep thinking that. many countries help poor countries all. giving dictators even respectable governments cash going help poor. people it. Granted state Montana hit hard others, feel like shutting schools March, long states, helped initial hit. asking trouble, I'm tired saying, ""I told so"". 

I genuinely feel bad kids obviously right leaning parents. They're all, ""It's flu, care kid gets sick, need send back, can't afford homeschool pay child care. they're wearing mask school!""  confusing average American citizen average American citizen hear selfishness. 

It's case news social media making things seem common really are. Crazy one critical decision could 2 term-Trump thousand lives save US global virus hotspot shunned internationally trump losing Texas. handlers completely missed mark, it'll history books. you’re part every chance get that’s fantastic. doesn’t absolve part wider collective failure. 

Look man find offensive people make blanket statements country get it. really do, gives personal pleasure say things country people grew around. 

But point many issues America less uniquely American western world single unifying factor: collective unwillingness ever put collective good front personal convenience. 

The stereotype Americans selfish entitled around decades probably didn’t come nowhere. far poorer job handling pandemic many far densely populated high-risk countries. it’s large contingent us unwilling accept even slight personal inconvenience greater good. 

Yeah us like enough antisocial mofos country rest us remiss stamping *before* global pandemic. far I’m concerned can’t accept, you’re part problem. No? wasn’t aware knowledge accurately give yes answer here. knew someone informed position isn’t advising global leaders instead shitposting Reddit. Agree, gets level Spanish Flu, think people finally learn lesson USA. masses polarized politically, half country dead set conspiracy theories massively failed education systems. It’s damn time rude rude awakening!! What's point going back school idiots charge listen actual educated people ""tanford researchers among several groups examining whether wearable fitness devices Fitbit Apple Watch provide early warning. Snyder’s team enrolled 5,000 people study studied historical smartwatch data 31 users tested positive COVID-19.

In one case, Snyder’s team found smartwatch able spot first signal potential COVID-19 infection nine days obvious symptoms reported."" death cult admit truth. We've already republicans like him. say getting great family done Covid. two week trend. Hopefully states take notice. cant half-ass way this. best thing could point start wearing mask everywhere, commercially available vaccine, get one national television. Granted neither happen. He's man child spoke mistrust vaccines covid even happened. almost comical considering gets tested multiple times day surprise getting antibody treatments. must somehow believed bs? thought ""fuck people"", would still know pandemic would flare again, thereby forcing close economy, thereby causing Republican party made misfire? seems like really weak strategy, even plain evil.  Yep. Might want apple afternoon snack instead toast. population wears masks. trouble makers dont. Cops deal trouble makers less people it. live NYC there's thousand good fucking reasons. mention might hurricane next week.. don’t get it?! take right others faces speak heard. Yeah sure protest this. /s  nothing every street four churches open, people packed bars restaurants. Nothing Florida's blistering heat causes people inside recycled ventilation. top majority think mask something created antichrist burn faces wear it. yeah let us blame protest. Funny saw way higher percentage protest crowds wearing mask local Florida Walmart. let poor help /s She’d see Southwest flights. would exactly? Risk hospital shut elective procedures longer death count getting high?

I don’t follow logic there.  Finding info difficult company site came close matching one label provide much details beyond private label branding. Winter?!?!? Everyone saying covid gone day election. /s me, decision whether go ER (my insurance copay get admitted), calling ambulance (free me) big deal, big drama actually *that* sick? get husband drive me, he'll exposed potentially expose kids. bought pulse ox. Hopefully happy hypoxic trigger call ambulance. remember couple months ago bunch redditors convinced 21 million people China died two month period. Crazy people willing believe absurd things, yet believe vehemently. Yes , know bad ! know found funny well. like see come live Chicagos south side west side. Riverdale, Washington park, fuller tell us ""for good reason"". Probably sitting safe suburb oblivious violence murder happening right Anyone got link dude broke hidden covid bean stash? Need find way get food. I'm sure families 5702 persons died (yes 5676, little guess; btw there's 79,000 cases today. Almost 2000 1 week) others who're enduring serious sequelas would appreciate lack concern. honesty, nothing, single thing. wrong scenario is, come. make people totally Dependant them, also giving powers, care taker. 
Think... Hunger games, yet severe.  say ""several undected cases per confirmed case"". literally describes every country world. Something like 5:1 quite normal. got mine Walgreens. Probably expensive online covid scare didn’t want wait. Ended negative case shit happens. corrupt group. would anyone give fuck say? cops treated people assaulted service industry workers way treated groups dare spill drop floor I've seen people wearing way round. Cloth mask first n95 top.

I assume fit better way.  Every parent know talks daycares schools amazing vectors germ spreading. heard good source people born finite amount energy, like battery, exercising drains battery, shortens Life!

good thing, exercise. wanna die early. Least amount per positive case, least amount total fyi Lmao Whitehouse big required things days. might even say they're laughably bad. conservatives Kentucky claim nasty respiratory cold went around back October/November really Covid, they’ve already immune Yeah situation shit second vaccine gets approved things look up. definitely 9 months shit ...but least GUNS, RIGHTS, &amp; PATRIOTISM, amirite??. **USA USA USA USA** Mah bad need Reconciliation tribunal. justification Republican states got gear Democratic states people held accountable.

If laws prosecute rewrite laws write new ones can't happen again. nothing else make official declarations damning responsible suffering loss life. Everyone know scumbags are. 

There much negligence let pass. Ahh boarder patrol. patrol boarder, boarder defined 100 miles every boarder, port, international airport. everywhere. Huh? Canada virtually cases, FAR fewer deaths Sweden. even close. data suggests 60 even that'd uh, better. live Salt Lake County worried longer requiring, requesting masks restaurant work at. Everything seen last week indicates businesses same, want employees injured. makes sense, however might make recent flattening curve kinda moot, folks take advantage private businesses enforcing mask policies. certainly calling police enforce mask policy, never seen police officer security guard even acknowledge maskless person grocery shopping downtown. Yeah true. meant say, going bad anyway, luckily adequate job wasn´t worse. Definitely ""throw man parade!"" worthy. Illustrates unfortunate reality many people lack empathy recognize problem risk hits late. We're reactive society ultimately far costly (both $ lives) could proactive mindset. I've always rooting Germany. [A comment made 3 months screw up, that's ok. German people find stride, efficiency save world. Kinda depending guys; know know...

For US, warning sign. difference leadership incredible, though. Germany made mistakes, thought ""We better fix mistakes! must protect people!"" US made mistakes, thought ""We better figure shift blame cover mistakes! must protect bank accounts!"" 

When Italy worst, general American public taking seriously. government media started hurling misinformation politicizing it.

What's happening really scary. government longer even trying hide care people. really goes sides too, Republicans. hard see come intact. afford it, tutors, coaches &amp; ""learning pods"" way go next year. Churches open Colorado That's basically main component social safety net be. sure do. absolutely lax. live rich county got hard seems like customers wearing them...but go local tanning salon signs door saying they're mandatory NONE girls behind desk wearing them. young course. wish states would slap finished sticker dates tests done, can't imagine headache would actually verify.  Anyone knowingly working sick right belongs jail over.

It unreal people think ok infect people deadly disease money.

Complete lack morals.  saying, agree opening quickly bad resisting lockdowns bad republican leaders obviously worse that. saying even though democratic leadership responsible mask orders shutdowns. Neither group succeeded actually slowing spread, republican states democratic states getting wrecked right (see Texas California) people following orders government control people acting selfishly across board. leadership issue much personal responsibility issue. said everyone unified response think things would better. Even absolve guilt people going large social gatherings refusing wear masks. Also politicization, everything politicized unfortunately point at. don’t like either it’s bad everyone except people power feel dangerous people continue serve ends. Reportedly there’s two week wait get cremated 😣 45, 3-6 die per 10000 infected. 

Over 70, 1000 die per 10000 infected. 

This really need know differences ifr different outbreaks. Big brain move Stop acting like Trump genius isn't. believe want mother definitely liar. knows fact job. google dude. known fact. ""There patent it, could patent Sun?"" - John Salk  Good know work facts consider people pieces shit. someone rich, hiring professional teacher tutor means want parent spend time kids? insult people live trailers? need understand unlimited testing supplies. game trying test millions people every day realistic view. face masks important. reduce spread, reduce need test many people. we're observing strain traditional avenues healthcare system, also strain clinical laboratories urgent care centers. 

People upset tests taking weeks countries faster! countries trying process volume tests high positive rate (negating ability pool samples many locations). volume tests people need high realistically problem government getting stuff fast enough, we're bumping testing limit. solution point shut things quarantine cases control less tests needed....but takes weeks. Last checked breakfast minor meal French culture, see fair number sweets generally talking small portions. Certainly healthiest thing world, compared stereotypical American breakfast (some combination bacon, eggs, pancakes, hashbrowns, toast butter, sausages, course syrup smother things in) gets one sided terms calories. It’s restricted conservative areas.

For sure. Misinformation afflict anybody. Even someone believes dangers covid 19, misinformation masks risks seep cause doubts make someone think twice concerned safety precautions. Oh? millions things he's said? corroborated real science? you. Everyone's addicted dopamine rush get phones turned brains mush.  go work/school sick. Keep germs home.  mean, I'm hoping get rid them. infect many others make lots disease line. you’re living world think 80% Americans desperate straights living paycheck paycheck you’re definitely living kind fantasy world. work brewpub, can’t even tell many customers ask gluten-free food simultaneously drinking Hefeweizen. It’s really wheaty beer! Blows mind. Smart watches lot things. read apple developing way test glucose levels sweat watch. diabetic would outstanding. can't afford continuous glucose monitor still hate pricking fingers samples. popular vote polls predicted. Trump pulled extremely narrow victories states gone blue decades. clear consistent Biden leads.

You win presidency losing popular vote points. can't win losing popular vote 8 points though. Far fewer voters undecided compared 2016 too. Trump campaign very, serious trouble right now, know it. may need start spending *in Texas*, places. Well, obviously ration rapid tests people need rapid result. mean data fucked, means think look it. Like, know last day chart always super high positivity super low test numbers? Like they'll tested ten people six positive? That's tests conducted resulted midnight 10am. people ER night symptoms also need stat test. vectors
pls

CoVid-19 become corporations' 'Piggy Bank' since start.

 
WH/Wall street promote 'weak' results meaningless tests (20 -48 candidates low % outcomes), drugs 'decrease 2 days hospital visit, malaria medications subvert mind, news releases acquiring drugs even trials getting preliminary little oversight.

Do even mention "" TESTING KIT "" debacle enormous consequences continue DECEIVE world Relaxation.

This Biggest Public ''Pump Dump'' agenda EVER!

The public continue sheep Corporate Elite.

BTW , Quebec company I3 BioMedical WOKE, mate  two days, whoops! turns indeed get again.😶😑 trust rich people make richer told reporter off, start thing, asking that.. woman, course. Said ""nasty question"" deflected. mean cars become even unaffordable already are? 
Surprised Pikachu face That’s post about. hit hard March. Now, unlike southern countrymen women, learned serious is, adjusted. fewer problems wearing masks , probably know people died. I’m pretty sure glorious Floridians surpass us metrics mentioned soon. dozens nations free dealt better virus US. Ok Weird thing predicted happen actually happened. I’m sayin you’re gonna beat chest Reddit company’s unethical behavior put money mouth boycott everything bad things. Plus, we’re gonna go road picking choosing, promise you, slave labor miles miles worse anything Chik-Fil-A doing. personally fond “ don’t like leave “ anything. One place never step foot again. Pretty sure we’ve done kidding either. experience Massachusetts despite locking *hard* (like shitty highways finally empty rush hour first time life), still took month later hit apex daily new infections reported. bet even worse south apparently taking 2 weeks get test result back. new infections peak month lockdown test results lagging another two weeks top that. EXACTLY!! many people saying “I’m gonna continue live life blah blah blah...” 🤦🏻 working sick sacrificing *other people's children* get sick cannot work.

What gives sacrifice kids save stranger?

Not working sick deadly disease mean sacrificing admit easy solution.

It super fucking easy. one gets yo intentionally expose others deadly virus personal gain.

How someone lacking morals think appropriate infect people deadly disease money?

Selfish fuck. tired ass talking point. Get head hot tight little ass real, people need talk more. Forcing kids, especially young ones, go back school dangerous going leave lot long lasting trauma. can’t hide them. - like many redstates, tough trust data Gov DeSantis done lots stuff hide info public
 - bottom line, COVID control state total dependence sales taxes, hospitality taxes rush reopen state revenue initiative much anything else Canada another. Also, voted leadership. point can't shielded effects vote. fucking chance. events unfolded continue unfold, including limited constant disinformation republicans president. facts situation. party politicized fucking pandemic day one. Refused act months. issued cdc guidelines safely open, states even guidelines, ignored same. never control. Republican Party said did. also said flu. also said live it. also said masks needed. list goes fucking on. think maybe seeing much reddit might fucking happened? haven’t really seen Democrats holding political rallies. Without masks social distancing. haven’t heard Democrat’s say masks aren’t needed. haven’t heard Democrats say fuck it, let’s open economy sacrifice grandma. Democrats certainly aren’t trying fuck healthcare pandemic. haven’t heard Democrats say it’s flu. try tie funding make kids go back person school. try protect companies put workers risk sake profit, preventing able litigate matters. list goes fucking on. Don’t stupid. dine -in Miami, come Broward. Casinos closed Miami come Broward. Next door neighbors indeed. That's problem society need figure soon. Stop letting social media bubbles exist. people able comprehend what's happening them. got mine Amazon, around $30, deal day like $22 something. 

Plenty options, lots stock. think yes, right substituted another administration current situation. However, another administration would dealt virus better outset February/March, reducing impact significantly. Days matter exponential growth administration wasted months. Itś way explain market tanking.

People want dollar-backed assets, plus Fed lending lot.

Doesn't anything unemployment. like ""you can't force horse drink, avoid shooting head""

Congress needs act McConnell anything coherent. Hopefully virus kills gets rid people like me. NJ, bad even virus wants there. 

I kid, nice state, lived good part life. Consider nuance sure force children go school, see many children state Florida murder!  Oh no, population quite dense....just different way agree, TON young obese people country, comment still applies. bottom line this: young people well die virus, *especially they're obese*.  home, live risk individuals, one care them, etc? feed they're bed ridden yet alive, anyone lives help? Jesus bad see comments frequently complaining moderation here, surprising we're pretty chill karma farming. WaPo fine source low quality article. sensationalized DeVos authority Covid-19 we're giving misinformation platform here.

And, yeah, see complaining constantly. Keep mind creating metadrama sub rules. Going way tag call stupid choice. Familiarize sub rules. Thanks. Effing Gen Z ruining things rest us Great, paywalled article. cite non-peer reviewed NBER “discussion paper” evidence? treatment? Enriching region? Providing education? Assistance college admission? exemption one child policy back then? guess propaganda indeed powerful many willingly knowingly blatant lies supposed concentration camps lol Ahh, ok, wondered, even know could thing months ago, thought worth mentioning. inconvenience?

Inconvenience sense someone home work capable helping online learning, simply want that.

I absolutely empathize parents stressed obligations unable work home. Well Canada turns choice get make ethics committee made me. though. totally agree using tools get best outcome people. simply make sense waste resources someone like saved case. feminists say toxic masculinity harms everyone including men mean lol.    toxic. I’m sorry can’t accept truth. Actual walking talking MD head internal medicine. real person. also sign real NDAs people like feel validated whatever hope achieve calling bullshit. 

Emergency relief funding predicated severity Covid related deaths. know might require wrap head around many complicated facets extend beyond saying “xyz bullshit”

What propose solution hoped achieve responded with? Don’t talk good ague well you?

Figured I’d get type response this. Signing post. I'm amazed, doctor, can't see need drink bleach, virus go away. scientists safety precautions!
Off buy clorox!
Public announcement (since reddit): please look 'sarcasm'! sacrificed two boys husband covid clipper bought occasion. Worked like charm lol it’s cool week half January last long trend articles question guess set /s heard Sealand nice time year. many people there, difficult social distance. ( ) going make joke thread shouldnt phones able tell us covid? didnt want bother thinking wording.

I exited scrolled two articles article sub apple watches fitbits finding earliest symptoms. 0.001% 1 100,000.  Google 37000000 * 0.001*%* percentage sign important. 
 

If one counter Case Fatality Rate (CFR) actually higher 1 100,000, links show CFR 20 low.   

The fatality covid-19 directly proportional age, health factors added in. 

I getting downvoted truth fit narrative. kids die. BUT, covid-19 easily spread. People school could get c19, children could bring home loved ones putting risk. Finally, getting sick recovering covid-19 rough experience, could lead long lasting effects like decreased lung function.  Yup. thought slam dunk Trump's reelection Biden Super Tuesday. way would Biden chance Trump.

And yet, today, put money would bet Biden heartbeat Trump. He's lost significant amount support this. excuse next week? That’s says.

But say gives people wrong sense safe, wrong use mask (which see damn time) even increases likelihood infection.

Because keep touching mask, face, going end well. think depends mild infection is.

""Importantly, **SARS-CoV-2-specific cells detectable antibody-seronegative** family members individuals **history asymptomatic mild matter much even following Putin's instructions? sad either way since either Republican politicians also compromised also fucking idiots based actions they've taken. vocal consistent support base also ridiculous. people really want knock over. Don’t forget, it’s hurricane season two lined already. winning? 🙄 friendly reminder many Samsung phones built-in pulse oximeters! LET LIBERTY RING!!! zero deaths far reported today either CA Texas, number close 600. another 1000 plus day. could've gift Trump's reelection.

Seriously. left screaming 4 years guy secretly Hitler wants turn country dictatorship total control one time little authoritarianism warranted drops ball. Right first one ends. nails done. spread easily via touch/surfaces. unless one idiots really needs McDonald's dine-in experience freedom, highly unlikely get infected. Go drive through. Wear mask.

I'd concerned fact trusting people earning living wage, forced work pandemic, forced serve karens day making something ingest. Fast food disgusting environment pre covid. Can't imagine like emplyees give even less fuck. Maybe talk entire nation minus states handling well like New England?  stand corrected! How’d Japan Korea deal it? must dug far comment history you’d see I’ve pissed since protests started. Edit: wrong Info me: ""Think title wrong seem get difference England UK..."" - England correct

By Libby Cherry
23. Juli 2020, 16:48 MESZ

Failing wear one prescribed areas could result 100 pound ($127) fine
Police “engage, explain, encourage, finally enforce last resort”
Face coverings need worn children age 11, “legitimate reason to,” disability Still still soon guy. way federal agents DHS patches shoulders uniforms Covid! Covid! Covid! They’re price anywhere get them. Stop promoting Amazon people Let's hope. Mine supposed open early, teachers/school board piled PD/PA days days government wanted reopening schools. start date would (Sept 8th instead 1st).

I like think school board flipping bird little. I'm beginning think Trump might actually lose Texas November. lack active informational campaign effects social distancing mask wearing. We're getting praises country masks widely accepted reflect reality. reopening tourism hospital Lleida filing new outbreaks. Tracking tracing failure Catalonia Spain general, point tracers would get average 2 contacts every person infected. cannot expect reopen minimum covered. minimum providing PPE healthcare workers, informing, tracking tracing, none gone well. closing border ineffective without effective screening measures. US closed border China, worked them? South Korea never banned travel China, much better place right now.  United States tested per million countries except happy this. go now? doctors world get know treatment start using (especially since don’t really treatment now)? **The CCP welded people inside homes allowed Chinese Citizens travel anywhere world**.

China complete nightmare country end. 

Outside China stronger, China. Maybe talk texas. 200 deaths yesterday 11,000 hospitalizations. think missing point.  every. damn. time. Merde say one thing other? Seems I'm already labouring point Americans struggle portions unhealthy food choices above. nitpicking single example used try illustrate point many Americans horribly unhealthy ideas food be, failing see forest trees. This. Stop wearing masks people! article says so. /s suggesting children likely die it? Texas? Opiates used sedation usually morphine. point drugs risk shortage.   print department seals stuck right back bought police car want buy ghost car. talking generic patch, buy actual department patches ebay Ok stop spreading lies. denying exists sure

I wrote paragraphs seemed reasonable. sure bothered, now. he’ll use way keep gyms closed. Maybe talk states? Political agendas welcome science driven community. point seems flown right head— can’t get people voluntarily wear masks even less inconvenient, there’s little hope we’ll able get voluntarily get vaccinated rate herd immunity achieved renders vaccine even less effective. many kids morphed Andalites? course are. fam tested last month. Two took 12 days results two took 10 days. lag depends location tested. brother told called upset delay told test basically dumped together regardless date testers work without discerning came first. Florida. couple types Kroger Brand soda **94%** **DAILY LIMIT Added Sugars**. 

I'm kidding. insane. Garbage would say majority schools US preparing person schooling. specific areas hard-hit opening remote learning, unfortunately seem minority. teacher absolutely terrified job right now. truly think one quarter distance learning would make huge difference safety. Nope, told we’re way cautious kids need school. one person tells kids can’t get it, I’m going scream. account differences testing rates? 45 WHOLE MINUTES??? LOL!!!

Try breath test, shows (accurate) results SECONDS! Maybe talk both? That's completely rebutted U.S. President Donald Trump's claim China allowed residents Wuhan, Chinese city hit hardest COVID-19 outbreak, travel abroad banning going parts exit routes city, domestically internationally, shut simultaneously late January, government Wuhan, capital Hubei province, announced early morning Jan 23 suspension outbound flights trains, city's public transport services, including buses subway, contain outbreak coronavirus within city.

[Washington's Wuhan travel claim rebutted](http://www.ecns.cn/voices/2020-06-09/detail-ifzwzeax1202393.shtml) I'm sorry hear job. Hopefully things start looking everyone soon. Thank kind words. really needed hear that. Lately I've felt bad wanting safe inside home much possible, I'm work. Damned damned don't. February March latest knew masks least somewhat helpful harmful. issue masks start due shortages wanted save healthcare professionals, lied public. apparent March even homemade mask scarf wrapped around face significantly better nothing. absolutely argument beginning April latest ignoring benefits lack drawbacks masks, reason leaders push mask use. actually nothing infection everything dollars. 

Florida probably fucked state have, pretty much zero corporate tax, zero income tax like 90% revenue tourist based. Fanta Menace said help states exactly happens. 

It's either bankruptcy plague inc.  rural NE Ohio tell 25% live here. many rail wear mask say ""it's mandate law"". spout talking points gleamed Facebook YouTube.  truly frightens live county populated idiots.  That's insane! Deadly origami. Well have!:) Time tobacco industry bailouts... Tell leaders political parties. Oh wait...we dont' care...oh well good luck America! Sadly 1 every 50 people know staying home. “got old” them. taking vacations therefore going restaurants, gas stations, donut shops, etc. Meanwhile home pissed can’t leave house don’t “get” angry Good, stay well! Goes show faithful/religious really are. key tenant Christianity take care sick. Instead force work. bunch lip service. second page ""study"" (not really study) nice chart country look at, procedures outcome as. Unfortunately, outcomes ""unknown"" point. hope update future.

What made realize disparate school reopening plans across US. make chart like per state, would made per state, per district. shall never forget watching man use WHO’s podium tell governments close borders Chinese saying world risk economy. day Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson came press conference criticizing unfriendly actions countries closing border China 

But that’s coincidence know Wait till finds states / countries seasons don‘t see explosive growth. gon embarassed Someone understand word ""preprint."" Ok, coronavirus countries without 5G? *27 different immigration systems… mean person replied add anything conversation, said wear mask. like said people like popcorn tried define may replied ""I like popcorn."" Sure, like popcorn, nothing get people like popcorn. Lived life. one time someone called mate. 1/10,000 1/100,000 mortality kids likely. Hopefully 10x tops long term health issues result surviving. 

With 70 million kids US, mitigation 100% infection rate result 700-7000 child deaths, 7,000-70,000 substantial long term health impacts. 50% infection rate numbers halved. We're probably closing 10% infection rate now, consistent 5 deaths Florida far. unclear whether Florida undercounting cold deaths much [total What's *really* fucked compare estimated deaths flu. Here's CDC doesn’t CDC base seasonal flu mortality estimates death certificates specifically list influenza may lead death causes, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. recognized many years influenza underreported death certificates. ... Additionally, deaths – particularly among 65 years older – associated secondary complications influenza (including bacterial pneumonias). ... counting deaths influenza recorded death certificate would gross underestimation influenza’s true impact.

Now COVID19, counting deaths death certificates people assuming numbers exaggerated. No, numbers *grossly* underestimated. 

If estimated COVID19 way estimate flu (using hospitalization rates estimate deaths) we'd find death total would far higher. Here's another CDC pneumonia influenza deaths subset total deaths associated influenza occur year, may 2 4 times higher complications also considered.

So 140,000 count COVID19 deaths? accurate. comparing 12,000-32,000 estimate flu deaths (2019 Jan-Jul) using higher estimate. Using 2-4 times higher approximation above, would 280,000-560,000. say, COVID19 could close 50 times deadly flu. 'napkin numbers', roughly [the minimum thrown scientists recent sophisticated calculation called infection-fatality rate, paired past months’ worth data, latest best estimates show COVID-19 around 50 100 times lethal seasonal flu, average. prove feeling? think coming civil war spread it? Damn, survey accurate:

Canada crude IFR 7326 (Deaths June 1)/ 37.6MX.01 \*  1000% = 1.95%

That's crazy high, high makes doubt results serosurvey. I've always estimated IFR\~1%. would assume food instead packaging. 

Such as, employee takes mask eat meal break. get covid germs touch clothing. put mask back go wash sanitize hands. working end touching clothing touched eating brush hands across face number ways could get onto hands. grab cup fill order food packaging bag on. touch items. 

That's assuming spread contact air. know we're actually anymore. know one time leave packages sit sanitize covid germs survive different materials different lengths time. realize contributing circle jerk, right? people believe anything everything health officials value, even though throughout whole pandemic nothing conflicting information bad advice.

But tell me, guy lying? Well take seriously actually vote people believe science next time.  Thursday. Midday. Rain comes goes. AC loud enough drown thoughts. People yell day demanding money die COVID. Cant blame them, really. gallon water day good you....

Edit: People downvote me. Probably posts interesing. dont care though, theres that....

Sorry. noir post. Tragic news, sure. Though quite interesting articles like events spring. me, that's sign things improved elder care since.  Even physically trapped, hard formulate escape plan five kids, one newborn. People literally riot lmfao. don’t care click link, study done amongst thousand people Poland.

Makes sense me. 

Psychopaths: “wearing mask repression personal freedoms”

Narcissists: “I’m sick, wear mask?” Or, “I know x professional, don’t need mask” normally ""be aware"" yeah... still good news interesting guess. Source? whole thing. Where's let's pull plug people ITT? Extraordinary measures bitches. Ask sources. Hashtag Dawn Planet Atheists Thank this... must missed episode! looked coofers like lepers long coronavirus. care covid, flu, chronic cough. want germs me. called moderation. Me: “They literally believe hospitals get money Covid deaths.”
 
You: “They do. Source: MD friend...” chose lackey. kiss Trump's ass. got good news bad news you. 

The good news: technology fun! bad news: yup. Black Mirror. ""she health issues"" 

Bullshit. clearly obese. might sound insensitive, society need address health population. obese, healthy, pre-existing condition. Nobody deserves die disease, many people flat let go act like *normal* massive. people surprised doctors tell get shit together. get one body, take care (I certainly could better). America doomed lol paid £50 national insurance per month UK. Much cheaper $217.50 premiums per month $7,900 deductible paid first moved US. currently pay $96 per month premiums $3,000 deductible. Oh god. You’re perfect example anti-expert phenomenon. 

Just experts wrong 10% time doesn’t mean it’s better trust people know wrong 50% time. we’re talking something like immunology, people know wrong probably 90% time. Terrible. send kids camp surging pandemic. NJ always shit together compared vast majority states. highest metrics education, healthcare, diversity... Indiana us, though? enough endanger herd immunity cases, like measles. Yep...   went local jack box first time last month won’t going back saw waiting food. Guy kept touching mask gloved hands handling stuff, kept slipping face obviously big. risked Taco Bell two weeks ago like night day. Contactless handling food, masks everyone, saw everyone changing gloves. think Kemp legitimately stupid one among them. two evil. Neither us predict future bring.

No, use past indicator prepare for. even advocating point? Let's unprepared, case things turn better expected? recently read Rhonda Byrne's 2006 bestseller *The Secret* convinced power positive thinking matter situation, something? least admit things better two months ago?

In New York? Sure. Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Nevada, Alabama, Tennessee, Idaho, California, Alaska, North Dakota, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Oklahoma, Colorado, North Carolina, South Carolina, Kansas, Arkansas, United States whole? Absolutely not. 

All states, others, currently experiencing highest infection death rates yet entire pandemic. Pretty much every curve trending up. Almost every day last 10 days seen record broken new cases nationwide. actually say ""things better two months ago"" straight face? New York New Jersey essentially places entire country that's true. School shootings schools, mass shootings without mass events, actual gun deaths rate country actually dropped significantly read. Despite media focus always small part gun death stats. 538 article showing statistically much race tends tighten incumbent president get closer November. even gets best tightening thats every happened before. he's still well key states needs win 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sure husband's nice man ain't true. Even though certainly causes contributing death, many experts believe deaths due Covid-19 actually **under-counted.** Sacré Poo! wrong, feel like manpower afford put people protocols place many places. know typed long post probably skimmed it. 

I never said get money patient dies. However, Covid related death toll high enough declared state emergency. Following me... 

Hospitals injected money thing called FEMA amongst many many sources. Google FEMA report back ever given hospitals money COVID.

This public information also, I’m gonna put friends name here. Go ask friend doctor hospital I’m right? Oh wait, don’t one talk behind scenes. Also clue vote. also don’t watch talking head shows. What’s source even know stand politically? could planet fucking mars stating facts. 

Since care headlines though, took 3 seconds know highly ironic saying peer reviewed article says exactly I'm saying. Lmfao. customers (Translation Google. Let know spot faults I'll correct them!)

**Employees went different seniors accommodation Falu municipality, even though one person covid-19.**

DeSantis probably worse, good option. voted Gillum based policies primary, 180 came time general. oxygen desaturation related blood clot relate? causing sudden death recovery mild symptoms? no! best tests! trump said so! vulnerable medical staff. know viral loads important sick people get, medical staff around covid patients would get highest viral load Total lie. There's evidence COVID seasonal, none is. two strains still (mostly one now) affected little temperature. Kanye! colonoscopy guess similar celebrity. person test positive.... negative.... positive again. Yes.

Can catch virus suffer wraith once....  determined. 


If anecdotes shortest lived ""immunity"" see move average. 

Its waiting watching sucks most. Already bought stocks guess? :) mean states higher immunity hit first? pretty much agree, but, inherently people imperfect.

Every country one problem another addressed million issues world people finite amount hills conceivably die on. understand saying, counterpoint, really control it. could throw anything slave made away refuse buy change. get it’s possible function society without it, I’d respectfully argue pragmatically excuse claim society doesn’t stand injustices. went Chick-Fil-a month ago cousin (I generally avoid it’s fave place car). Anyway, employees outside masks took orders person, standing front menu board. Like found odd suppose it’s better outside? again, people car aren’t typically wearing masks ordering. 

Is typical Chick-Fil-A drive thru strange one? cousin acted surprised shocked taking orders person car window like common thing. Ya imagine would worst nightmare. Trump president situation makes even worse nightmare. Every business opportunity take 2 million federal government PPP. 

If cannot make kind cash injection, business deserves survive. know cordyceps make ant crawl high traffic path exploding head? You’re going reason them. They’ll come something else. 

Just saying current argument Except fast food chicken isn’t even chicken.

Good luck getting kids virtual learning without good internet connection. students also hurt much this. Also, many parents tend working class,so send kids school can't home watch them. live Canada read alot news happening America covid interesting see approach things Americans approach things Lol mods terrible Travel seasons maybe? Either way, denial never good look, especially someone puffy greasy DeSantis. Floridians getting infected whether convenient not. overabundant source armed men women paid taxes protect serve. also spent months telling us virus isn’t airborne masks wouldn’t help lmfao. fuck woulda thunk it.

After got latent Tuberculosis (the kind active contagious dormant) EXHAUSTED like year too. Sometimes would lay ground cause body felt like 1000 pounds. 

 time diagnosis would go doctor tell horrible felt thought hypochondriac head.

 way sort vindication know crazy hear people taking time recover covid even virus passes. 

 immune system engaged weird stuff happen lasts lingers months years.

I'm better 10 years. 

Feel better hope recovery continues!   agree you’re saying logic true people anti maskers anti CDC also anti oil company propaganda telling us climate change isn’t real green movement 

Yet people anti mask also anti climate science etc. 

The truth imho , republicans telling voters ignore scientists discredit idea thing like free press (calling fake news), science (normalizing conspiracy theories, fake news, deep state, etc) 

And Republicans also keep voter base dumb defunding education system pandering non college educated members base 

It’s explanation people believing completely (and obviously) contradictory things. 

For example, group people felt businesses right refuse service gays, people going fucking crazy businesses refuse service wearing mask 

It literally makes sense. explanation can’t form rational thought parroting propaganda tells believe Yeah, see kicker I, daughter, LIVE NORTHERN ITALY. Like, one worst-affected areas. 

Back February March things bad literally sent videos balcony ambulances going day, told anecdotes friend Covid19 nurse main hospital city. 

I asked believes Italy also global conspiracy take Trump, said, “well you’re living SOCIALISM don’t democracy.” 

We’re dealing rational person here. Bruh googled tons reports it. 
 
Present couple, specific quotes say “Hospital paid death Covid patient”.
 Medicare pays treatment people die TIME. like Medicare pays patient lives.
 
Hold hold hold on....
 
Are saying Medicare reimburses treatment living Covid patients, specific fact also-means receiving money death patient? shittiness competition. Sure course. academic paper sub. That's r/covid19. True. could stop talking move China.  Well much hate say it, one lad internet education. happy ass go library. Maybe sort designated seating certain age groups? know idea weak honest work. Many trust geologists say Earth billions years old life existed one form another that.

They cut funding driving instructors. 

Snake oil merchants always pushed medical experts. Today's snake oilers called anti-vaxxers Republicans. side note, wish someone would ask Oprah Winfrey feels giving anti-vaxx people uncritical airtime years well creating Dr. Phil. Depressing... Like first time also lot fast finished... Never attribute stupidity adequately explained malice. Unemployed due pandemic? Uh oh :( mean people lost minds Trump first banned travel China. can't even imagine uproar banned travel everywhere start this. teacher, please believe say: better child safe. time school stuff later. Whatever fine. US schools designed handle kind outbreak. Please dont stress school. one hand I'm you, hand good 40% country support Trump despite madness. I'm really sure make that. remember bit month ago cases first went 4000, people, even doomers Newsom apologists, said ""data dump, data dump,"" like, looks right trend line me. days later 7 day rolling average 4000. 

There always days deaths cases reported late, days, like yesterday, still significant suggest earlier days reported trend upward deaths. I'm saying rolling average get high, I'd guess going increase even next days week.

The good news hospitalizations finally seemed level last week so, probably mostly due mask mandate bit re-closing hottest counties. full effects re-closing come online, I'd say could get transmission rate one go there.

Of course still way way way many cases effectively contact trace going long haul get place safely reopen. there's unfortunate geographic proximity Arifuckingzona. {closes eyes, sticks fingers ears, loudly yells ""la la la, CDC guidelines""} &lt;-- solves lot problems

All big 4 North American leagues indirectly stated following CDC guidelines self-isolation close contact positive case expect 2020 championships, get far, ""last one Covid, wins!""

edit: word Yes. lock ethnic groups ""re educate"" concentration camps. Point direction camps US citizens. need people witness bullshit going step shame people. 

Some kid stabbed old man last week confronted wearing mask guy attacked police officer. what's point hospitals hateful believe children best served mother father two one compensate lack other. 

You disagree day long, hardly ""hateful."" want avoid shortage makes sense. sick people means masks needed, telling people masks work increases need masks. must another reason. internal dialog non-stop R-bombs days. saying people dont believe scientists, well spoken change mind? That’s true all. small % idiots refuse wear masks. come political spectrum. “looks” way media left. 80% reddit. 

I hate Trump putting wearing masks Trump even Republicans ridiculous. individual herd immunity.

Oh god. keyboard suggested common phrase. Oh person immune, carrier, herd immunity matter still, average, infect fewer 1 person (and that's compounded fact someone infected, viral load low, thus less likely average reinfect someone else).

Herd immunity definitely harmed carrier status.

The goal herd immunity get enough population immune virus protects extremely vulnerable virus.

When talk immunity potentially infectious carriers, we're saying protect vulnerable.

So would actually pretty big deal. people ~~are~~ may protected coronavirus ways

We know yet, we? let's hope best. can't deaths covid report them... taps forehead believe could get 40% Texans agree sun orbits Texas. sleep night?

Because thinks constituents idiots really care health safety? done randomised control trials February, March April anymore viral circulation low need huge number enrolees show whether difference.

The end quote missed off. Oooofta. Eisenhower rolled grave. ""Testing industrial complex,"" rich. I’m Texas. mother thinks masks conspiracy show comply government. said gets virus refuses test doesn’t want data pool increase numbers. refuses wear mask voting trump November. love her, it’s amazing good people convinced madness surrounded like minded bible thumping gun owners. leaving state year. longer surrounded people think way. It’s truly sad. feel entirely alone unhappy here. Beautiful state, horrible politics indoctrination. instance, residents typical county cut visits nonessential businesses half, single infected person transmitted virus 46% fewer people would county business proceeded usual, study authors found. counties, reduction could end outbreak.

This fits latest study read pegs herd immunity 43 percent. 43 percent immune, would similar able spread 46 percent fewer people, say could end outbreak. NYC 20 percent way back March April. 

But use mobile data study.

And compare mobile data countries, see US shut pretty much average western countries. then, much worse US stopped flights China stop someone China flying Europe US. BIG GYM free ride long!  “Should” stay open it’s safe? No.

“Must” stay open stave economic disaster? Yes. Well, good news Easter.  first restaurant got food many months scared eat out, excellent wearing masks gloves. 

We’re back eating home cooked meals. much risk. That's set beginning. one, want follow rules Florida wants to. We're huge nation large cultural differences local needs. world obviously missing far cases counted.

We know real number factor 5, 10, 20 even 100 higher official tally, safely assume much **much** higher reported number much winning TIL I'm health expert. understand either. Personally always upvote random Redditors making sweeping statements largely unknown pathogen.  Nobody could possibly know global pandemic declared Yes indeed, think means R=2 serial interval around 1 week. incidence still super low 1 new case per 100 000 inhabitants last 2 weeks (one Europe's lowest) test positive rate 0.1%. 

But I'm indeed worried fall winter. contact tracing relies symptoms miss 20% cases asymptomatic spread put quarantine (those exposed develop symptoms get tested). going need masks point want avoid restrictions. saying mom would listen governor, daughter? I’m sure that. ok ill follow advice experts know lot virology PPE concede I'm expert subject making small change type mask big deal. stick guns want told wrong know way do...

It basically comes given new information, going think dismissing false. can't see issue well... Americans arent prepared retirement, dont lack stressors. Lots boomer hatred, facts. think smart approach. N.S.  majority cases deaths LTC insurance please. Declined?..... Uh oh :( went him, played conspiracy. said ""ok? would point killing ""old sick"". would gain ""them""?""

he said gets older people way. asked ""ok...for reason? why?"" said dont pay social security insurance every month. said ""what would point targeting something like this?"" goes ""so make money, scam!""

I asked ""what would point though? get older folks way?"" said ""i said why"" go ""so theory is...that bs made insurance companies , scam kill older people dont pay insurance, social security things?""

he goes ""sort of. virus real, using cover control us"" kept going started ""control us? already control us within constructs society. pay taxes? pump gas? fill car oil? buy stuff store? credit cards? use paper currency? computer? passwords? already controlling us. really wanted control us even more, would something even controlling virus. think argument something even feasible...it's logical""

know said? ""well ok...you right opinion...""

Edited bypass auto Except ones think morally intellectually superior everyone disagrees use word ""science"" end every argument.

Tell said false means. think healthcare system A++ means prove wrong.

And like go take couple pictures roads state. travel far.

Iunno taught school yelling word science people exactly scientific method. times change guess. mean protect Federal Property, State refused Looks like within next 2 weeks, alot people take seriously. path sacrifice government/ Confederates chose take. gonna rough likely skyrocketing death rates three four weeks schools open -- unless act quickly close again. may scare people enough finally listen. wish come this, people listening. That’s relevant. asked hate positions. I’d believe earth flat convinced could teach even half population normal Gaussian distributions think it’s complicated topic. What's Fauci know? Donald takes advice real health experts Fox News. comment post deleted? 5 years nothing changed love leaders question actions employees, couldn’t correct alleged problem himself.  GFY mean won’t happen i’m busy taking drugs leaching parents resources, I’m saying wanted could briefly stated ""some things important life"" going it. disgusting. People rarely change behaviour benefit people, themselves. 

That makes wearing mask hard people, benefit personally, society does. Maybe sold way. You, well. 

Always appreciate good, mind-stimulating communication point though. studies show this, particular case prove anything, flaunted such. feels EXACTLY like people post stories ""I COVID, die get really sick there's nothing worry about"", irregardless fact people affected differently. understand, kids liar, would feel immoral asking proof cause redditors believe me. relaying information smart, caring reputable person whose mother died. Take leave it. someone worked bouncer security, find situation, disassociate mask requirement. Make clear rule, company policy state mandate. enforcing policy/mandate. Make sure contact information manager corporate headquarters register complaint. Know information top head. delay looking information gives person chance work up. Bill who?


(I hope right. Knock Knock joke virgin, least english... Exciting!) laws using face masks Norway, Denmark, Sweden etc, spread also diminished greatly.  think guy trolling you, seems deliberately dense. deliberate attempt, US sure know else, de-educate US population purposes control profit.

It's ""evolution"". nurture, nature. Ventilators harm good told Europe amazing considering taught public private schools today better last Thursday. basically positivity rate. lower testing. deaths though. Solution: latex zentai outfits respirators. ultimately matters total numbers are. Sweden far high. matter going now, always happens viruses. damage already done. Crazy. school district online January. feel bad teachers thrown fire. It’s fucking right... metro areas masks definitely used least much, honestly much more. problem people always wearing properly. get rural areas get majorities anti-mask people. Sympathetic cause represent. Buko Haram group foreign invaders, Nigerians themselves. Ha  Sweden shown deeply corrupt?

What basis Swedens numbers incorrect?  want clicks, care anything else. masks could literally save countless lives high risk people, we're telling wear old shirt face instead comply something one prove real risk. third ventilator can't talk.......... praying you, I'm agnostic. can't imagine stress going through, I'm frustrated enough Canada. kill yourself, best survive pass learn people come you, something productive do. hurt yourself. like username.  follow picture, wearing one finished drink take roughly six years college hilarious number state tests “performance assessments” credentialed educator.

So glad I’m done BTSA. We're worse sense injection widespread less localized. We're also anything stop spread areas. Apparently we're refusing learn lesson. Good job. Keep up. 8 pounds month 300 year, 200 next. Oh, I've done before. can't remember exactly guy said, said ""How know Hillary Clinton afraid of?"" spouted something using term ""logic"" went ""yeah, that's inserting thoughts someone's head, symptom schizophrenia, amongst psychotic disorders."" got blissful peace never hear shit came man's mouth again. 

But fact patients challenge health care professionals' knowledge education probably another hundred-whatever number reasons stopped nursing. like told I'm stupid day passing doctor's orders, people noncompliant ""THEY KNOW DOCTOR"" come complaining wave magic wands heal them, like demanded. understood little Covid’s transmission time. also concerns masks we’re going g short supply health workers- certainly case.

/s I've heard death gasping air dying hospital morphine someone grabbing hand. makes sad Florida's 8900 excess deaths March May? 

I really wish could insert Homer Simpson gif, nothing see folks! words poetry. hard time believing conservatism. Maybe I'm conservative something else. take time making decisions also willing take emergency measures would rather overly careful careful enough. even upgrade cell phone firmware day one, would rather wait weeks see public's response them.  Sadly. won’t learn this. next pandemic result similar shutdowns, deaths economic downfall president bragging cognitive testing prowess. 🙄

We also wasting insane amount time talking stupid bullshit sorry hear that. 
On note, since take U-bahn regularly, seen lot young kids without masks. Seems like parents get note kids get fucking virus. testing industrial complex?! \*had\* testing industrial complex, would great - maybe would widespread availability testing rapid turnaround! didn’t get it. Disenfranchised people America get lied time. What’s happening minorities China cover-up auspices education camp, ie, also lie. However, one situation (USA) people colour *know* could happen them. one looks China, desperate depressed American, see mindset could ‘even minority China, I’d still fed, clothed educated’.

Sorry wasn’t clear. I’m well aware horrors going western provinces.  lol.......you probably right..........

I think number sounds pretty high, tbh.........but think probably many infections known..........maybe 13 X many though.

The US sad state affairs right now. envy guys all. don’t know feel like voiced, word word current life situation.... mean, don’t think Ill ever look friends way...
Also, zombie movies need reimagined, sure people go dinner middle zombie apocalypse, actually grew people _gestures towards Florida_ live San Diego Monday (4 days ago) husband's work decided needs back person immediately.

Seemed like addressing said impossible ethical modern society. That's sounds disgusting. wonder regular micro-doses airborne covid provide immunity without infection. plan reduce hospital beds mostly regular wards ICUs. Germany much compared Western countries without benefit concerning morbiditiy mortality. 21% Germans hospitalized per year compared 9% Dutch later ones worse long run. plays role, much resistance regulating processed food industry? can't make healthier? would reduce obesity save lives Cool, heard example before. use following explain it:

We live SC. returning Sept. 8th haven’t heard anything mandatory masks. Yeah, reports capacity hospitals people dying home skyrocket. 

I think admin clever enough fudge numbers plausible way; expect depart reality pretty sharply. It’s Black Shirts name took 8 days get test results back took it. testing infrastructure doesn’t allow accurate picture. Also, LabCorp said demand exceeding ability process tests. likely cap amount tests plateau cases. doesn’t mean people aren’t dying we’re running hospital beds. Teacher Strike&lt;&lt;

I wholeheartedly agree. Nothing gets government's attention good old school protest march.

I would volunteer stand teachers Federal Agents part teachers right movement. What?? Wtf talking about? attacking all, just... death camp ants...what fuck? actually work 8+ hours day, see it'd stressful them. absolutely hammered 2AM. Church Camp fast track meet Jesus!

Yay! Pretty sad. obviously underlying health issues. People die home that’s happens next. help coming not. 

We close vaccine, probably several. close pretty promising treatments, well - encourage go look r/COVID19 haven't. 

This pandemic see us 2021, see us 2021. 

We likely never fully eradicate COVID-19, combination vaccines, treatments immunity (at least period time) recovered, pandemic within year. predict somewhere around spring, honestly. That.... is... insane.

I lost Milky Way comparison. keep total death count lower NY/NJ higher death counts.

Also, wanting keep things open watching death count continue business usual. First people charge said watch confirmed cases, rose said watch hospital admissions, maxed out, they’re urging watch death count.  imagined bread line, said nothing kind.

Put dick away. We're always assholes every opportunity. Americans health experts worst nightmare. ""Hey, there's pandemic going on. wear simple PPE stay away people ""BUUUUUUUUTT MAH FREEDOMS!"" Good point Also TX also even depends within city. currently anti-bodies going gym still wear mask properly 100% time. Even different locations chain gym city mask use vary widely. one I'd estimate 80% completely nose even dangling around neck. one prefer go that's vigilant awareness asking members wear them, opposite. 80% wearing properly almost entire time except brief readjustments drink water. “It’s slowly getting worse, things better.” Americans** everyone else world taken action searching yesterday news rest world doing, ran across article. wanted read it, subscription WSJ. able give main takeaways? GOP inaction disinformation likely spread COVID-19... Indeed. :(

[Link Forbes piece former Harvard prof HIV researcher talking covid lymphoid/myeloid folks know I'm making [link earlier piece study China originally done Feb. small population, that. first surprise roughly 20 percent people groups made detectable IgG response SARS-CoV-2. IgM, number even lower. 30 40 percent infected detectable levels IgM. raises question virus cleared (as eventually studied) without robust antibody responses. speculate may due non-specific response cells myeloid lineage via T-cell mediated immune response.

So basically, 20% made antibodies. (The IgM showing late fascinated since February, actually I've reading papers since knew ill *right moment*.)

Edit: I'm opinion refractory reservoirs, one may platelets. love bug season bugs sex air splatter car fucked death pile shit can’t scrape off. Reddit, one productive Yeah, place I've seen says this. always cited never science back up. I'll try paint argument best can, hope take seriously wave off.

My point can't lockdown forever. serious side-effects locking need accounted for. I've taught elementary school, truly believe fully online school year dire consequences many students, fooling yourself. 50 million Americans filed unemployment. Countless businesses forced close. Mental health many people young old risk. cost-benefit analysis needs done.

And say that's heartless, guarantee already it. 2019, 37,000 people died car accidents. one protests driving, society agreed 100 deaths/day worth benefits driving. Everything contains risk unfortunately can't save literally everyone. life Covid, hope see coming place concern are.

As figures, realize conducting 800,000 tests day I'm sure realize cases asymptomatic. judging case numbers paint accurate picture things getting worse testing constant likely finding asymptomatic cases see before. like use death rate, let address places wrote.

Florida: rising, cause concern

Louisiana: uptick past couple days, early tell

Texas: rising, cause concern

Mississippi: pretty constant since May

Nevada: uptick last couple days, early tell

Alabama: slight rise

Tennessee: slight rise

Idaho: currently averages 4 deaths/day

California: slight rise last month, pretty constant since April. Still, cause concern.

Alaska: deaths meaningful stats

North Dakota: 1 death/day

Colorado: lowest death rate far

And on... Florida Texas increasing rates sure, states problems suggesting. need figure point lockdown produces problems Covid, personally think we're approaching/past point. consequences face economy (which drastic). 

Anyway, read far, thank you. hope find common ground somewhere. instance, agree protect vulnerable (nursing homes especially) wearing masks socially distancing around them. certainly need protection disease. required picture definition Urban Dictionary word 'Tool' would photo one would use..

Could make happen, actually ? would prevent next pandemic give money billionaires instead? /s  Maybe consolation, y'all build fence outside wall goes around MD, DC, NOVA region. trying want associated rest south  Isolated infected constituents. confused love bug season, worst all. fucking kidding me? knows true hospitals reached seen requests refrigerator trucks. 

He's lying. 

And killing people. Use it? something gyms general? Even 6 months good enough, gotta keep getting shots parties I’d love take kids movie beach asshats screwed every bit Italy achievement unlocked Fucking death cultists. please go heaven stop making world hell?!?!?! like see say god forbidden 1 kids. risk likely slightly higher since droplets would travel towards them, would harder time reaching you. overall risk low situation. death bad every other, 1000 yesterday. That’s good news me.

But answer assume really asking - daily number humans dying high April, it’s clearly climbing back up. Great news. need scientists countries come together work vaccine, bullshits like great wall stops spread virus bad hombres. Yes, leaves possibility find another way *looking @ u, 5g* Imagine China would handle absurd selfish stupidity. Shocking.

Why people *stupid* days? clear people give fuck spending money preventative measures. There's countless warnings years years respiratory pandemic. There's countless scientists calling measures put place, however general public really like idea money spent something show immediate benefits said they're going focus education, penalties. doubt kind people capable educated, honestly like approach. people straight scared break law well. many, definitely exist.

At end day, every single person knows enforcement anywhere country affect compliance. mandates force compliance businesses, schools, etc. about. 100% compliance feasible goal. sucks, truth well know it. mandates help regardless. “tHe cOmpANy cArEs Us, wOUlDNt pUt pROfiT SaFEty!!”

Idiots. Lack access preventative medicine explain 40% obesity rate. companies make testing machines completely sold back ordered. can’t add manpower supplies work It’s issue particular prevalent Bay Area many people, including myself, stocked masks result wildfires 2 years back. insane think part we've good long. Divorced parents two parents working much another thing. lot older people know built houses, cars, worked airplanes. lot young people know wont put set brake pads save $200-$300. Individuality strength. know people started nothing flipped houses. deciphering numbers physically redoing add value. Houses relatively cheap area. He's smart enough human know saying lie. point anyone think seasonal SUMMER.


He's deep mess, either admit 100% fault here, continue charade. Nearly 50% cases per 1mil 25% deaths less testing per person several health officials saying state covering numbers hardly ""barely difference"". course not, completely different plan that. /S  That’s fair, I’ve looking hard hobby lately know important something interesting time. say use burn time, doing? Cleaning them, shooting them, something else? Sometimes cringe think people voted idiot. two choices. One accept eyes telling thus accept fact idiots. reach gigantic conspiracy everyone screw keep drinking cool aid.... pity every one them. put study says small pp linked wearing mask every lifted truck driver country 5 on. 3 years? Unlikely. take long 3 million Americans die ""achieving"" herd immunity. Here's [stat use. 

143,967 deaths US, currently. Bonus points spray bottle handwritten label saying RONA JUICE? would personally this. gap year stuck home quarantine? good that? Online classes probably easier pass. self disciplined enough, teacher conscientious, able learn much well online person. suckier annoying way things proper effort get done. fair: love idea gap years one take long trip see world gain real world experience etc. former isn’t possible latter worse option online classes safety-wise. Assuming comorbid conditions, odds getting sick need hospitalized 2.5 100,000, .0025%. low age protective here.

The odds symptoms longer recovery period like many /r/covid19positive definitely higher something probably expect. likely outcome age full recovery, stay positive. kinda get it. imagine vast difference metro county county south. 
I think Cherokee county making mistake opening like normal time tell. imagine/hope info making right decision. testing = babby

if u take 5 pregnacy test, u get 5 babby Meat plants...or indoor line Disney ride, supermarket checkout line. Yet another LIE. Yet another lame excuse avoid anything actually stop virus.

About 90% people Florida yet disease. number cases increase (about) ten fold, unless DeSantis something stop it. medical costs, permanent disabling diseases, deaths increase much, too.

There two things stop it: issue statewide mask order; order statewide lock down. 

DeSantis must issue statewide mask order.  

The longer puts off, painful be. going go away itself. 

But, continues make LIES, instead signing one lousy piece paper. Yeah thought delaying daughter's kindergarten year, could better experience it'll year. wonder parents same. Locally, places mandated masks seen significant increase mask-wearing. state local officials could try, rather saying personal choice, personal responsibility, unconstitutional require. Everyone bullying Sweden fact never hard lockdown, instead people followed (and still following) quite strict recommendations situation control. keep going level see secondary spikes like Melbourne Barcelona. 

It possible cope live decent life. even without masks, might taken us faster used them. thing is, real talking point Trump good presidency economy doinng well. Even recession fault takes away one claim success. pretty clear Trump understand viruses work. sees originated China, shut travel China, *failed* shut travel places still travel China. Like blocking country would solve everything. confidence one thing enough, much clear understand work thinks China's fault America bad, even though acknowledges made impossible China reason America got virus ata high degree. obvious it’s even news  say that.

Queue linking one line interview going take context.

To reply, ""the first question interview Fauci literally says wearing mask infected stop infecting others"".
At bottom interview states masks kept people need them.

Implying, told people walk around masks implied people need them. Stop taking things easily verifiable context. non equivalent countries suffering? count? I'm saying way blaming CDC, mean exact thing happen next time. prove point dumb average person is... average mean 50% sample space either side point - *median*.

**Example:** [ 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 15, 18, 19, 20].

Here, **average 10.6**. (add numbers divide numbers. case divide 108 11.That would mean average 9 15, 7th 8th numbers based index.

The median 6th index set number 8. 

Imagine numbers representing IQs person. Thus 11 people. **The person IQ 8 would person median IQ** - equal amount people less intelligent intelligent. **The average IQ everyone would 10.6.** declare Florida zero deaths? 

Problem solved! climate change! It's, uh... climate shift. Oh Really? FREEDOM!! Yeah think it’s good idea sick people whatever looks like we’ll socially distant forever doesn’t even matter anymore. tbf US quite frankly competent leadership. Can't blame Americans trusting leaders especially certain someone kept downplaying students *want* go back. remember biggest frustration back college people would try tell best interest make decisions me.

If students want go back, let them. don’t, stay home. primary concern keeping students on-campus allowing Covid enter cities hold universities. Covid spread among student body, especially student body immunocompromised students stayed home, hardly issue. you’re age 25 don’t conditions would interact poorly Covid, health risk close zero fathom. conditions, that’s real sad, *stay fuck home* let people risk make decision. believe thats back then, tended test people already quite sick, thus causing shorter delay One things overlooked collection interest mechanical aspect it, seems echoed replies. kind knew physical ability aspect, like trap shooting stuff, didn’t really think in-depth could get. appreciate response! well clearly deficient reading comprehension. said, average. 1 2 would average intelligence. sad. feel like I'm swimming mud waiting day day see pass extension. savings ok bit feel everyone lose everything. probably correlation people go catch Covid people still use Yelp.

There's far many people refuse accept something problem literally slapping face eher traurig als lustig. lustig ist nur die Trollfrisur und das Stück Fleisch auf dem die Haare aufgeklebt sind I’m trying get husband trim hair flat refuses.

Theyll still get kids vaccinations, dont get flu vaccine. anti vaxxers think giving kids vaccinations gives autism 40-50 percent general population. agree much. Basically demonizing people behaviour isn’t going fix anything, masks issue really; it’s jerking ego stoking “us vs them” mentality imo. study definitely act fodder that. 

People throw labels around insults, narcissists psychopaths perfectly capable behaving like decent human beings many make positive contributions society. isn’t fault operate differently take different approach get cooperate - focused figuring out.

I really like interpretation behaviour. wish people would approach issues empathy curiosity like think you’re really onto something there. 

I really believe demonstrating real empathy patience help much things like hostile behaviour shoving “facts” people’s throats. usually pisses makes dig heels in. may irrational, emotional, stubborn, uneducated interpreting scientific data, paranoid conspiracies, self-interested side, whatEVER reason may behaviour, sure shit doesn’t make less human. 

They already suffering ignorance - shouldn’t making worse acting like that’s entirely fault. shaped genes environments; aren’t inherently evil incapable change.

I almost feel like issue similar dealing “problem kids” schools. Everyone expected learn way, don’t! doesn’t work like that. kids deficits issues make harder grasp concepts follow rules, learning disabilities, ADHD, rough home life, etc. used written lazy insubordinate whatever, know usually require different teaching style may take time learn. aren’t superior person grasp concepts easily apply - you’re lucky. think goes grasping severity coronavirus situation effectiveness preventative measures. help less fortunate, bully them; even it’s hard do.

Of course think it’s different person question charge protecting people. Clearly many people positions power aren’t using power good people. need empathetic rational people integrity leaders. American political system obviously needs major overhaul, well shit public education system, certainly fuelling ignorance gets incompetent people elected first place. 

Didn’t mean long, whoops! Got carried away. probably oblivious way mark. thought moving, stopped like psycho. earth trying flatten curve human pandemic. frustrating elected leaders still refuse acknowledge deny severity situation. life, actions. criminal justice system this? think u believe data based lack knowledge situation. Maybe check back 9 months see progress vaccine rollout feel like video clip DeSantis May Pence boasting state well going haunt long time would argue relevant look regards possibility reinfection.

You're correct assessment SARS-CoV-2 closer related SARS, mean immunity same.

For example, SARS-CoV antibodies last lot longer SARS-CoV-2 results provide strong evidence SARS-CoV antibodies reduced years symptom onset. antibodies play important role protective immunity SARS-CoV (15), findings study important implications regard assessing risk reinfection among previously exposed populations (e.g., hospital staff) evaluating duration antibody-mediated immunity candidate vaccine could SARS, [SARS-CoV-2 antibodies fade rather regard, SARS-CoV-2 acting like common cold SARS.

I would call relevant information. guarantee god damn thing done it. jumped bridge, would you? mind all.

I transitioning one med another (off tramadol, opioid, onto topiramate, migraine prevention med), expecting WTF side effects, initially thought, ""wow, that's side effects."" happens exposed *the day* ordered new med (started days later).

My first symptom specifically say ""that's covid"" (and med transition) anosmia (loss smell) 10 days initial exposure. ached (part withdrawal opioids, doubt), feeling generally sick. timing, hard say symptoms definitely one other, written journal, marked fact med, C covid ? for…could either (if they're known possible med symptom list).

Probably I'm celiac, went full gastro route symptoms early (so nausea, vomiting - even appetite eaten - minute, diarrhea), worse usual celiac med transition kinds things. (I've tramadol, know that's like, so…yeah, that.)

I lot coughing, upper respiratory, fever, sore throat. migraines, migraines (which common covid, amps pain, known then). migraines extend bottom trapezius, bottom ribs. wrapped way around ribs intercostals. described like someone threw bar kicked times side. (Seriously.) hurt like several weeks. Tested neg flu. O2 okay, pneumonia, worry it. Later, happened appointment family member mentioned it, got shuttled x-ray CT. Ground-glass opacities. :O Still pneumonia.

The weird side effect ties nausea spacial distortion. Like space would suddenly shift cubic 12-sided 8-sided slightly curved or…something cubic. enough quite sure door was, floor. knew real, made everything really nauseating. Anyhow, that's vomiting would usually happen, obvious reasons. Ugh. went away ribs stopped hurting really badly (though still hurt). weeks, nightmares it.

The one gone away, less pronounced, I'll sitting lying it'll feel like I'm moving. Still happens. Like feels like earthquake. like cat jumped bed. truly strange, lots long-haulers one really clear explanation what's happening. think tied fatigue somehow. Anyhow, may what's officially called fasciculations…or not. Remains seen.

The last thing I'd get occasional racing heartbeat, often apparent reason (i.e., sitting around nothing). That's sent ER day, though think inadvertent dehydration pushed top. Well said weird Texas front page made political, barely upvoted Okay, see coming from. Yeah, seem managed slow cities. sorry :( Please wear mask, can. still might help.  Well, go grades, guess education system must different

But hey, guess trust say boss hired retired teacher teach kids next school year said schools wouldn’t opening time soon. It’s almost like countries aren’t larger entirety Europe don’t 350 million people. replying another post gave impression Americans wear mask mostly political reasons. also great, get better chicken costs less Royal Farms. Sadly one room Florida can't pay way it. structure government taxes makes revenue completely based people coming visit. need stay open times.

If Florida many Southern states disconnected America, would closer something like Slavic states. Run cronies fascists, constant upheaval, terribly disorganized, corrupt, generally great place live. look places handling virus. Seems pretty similar Florida, right?

America whole trying hold places accountable hundred years. constant battle losing right now. think issue regards lockdown pretty low levels compliance. People still flocked stores didnt wear masks. people know still attended gatherings. lockdown requires people actually comply, therein usa failed control Uh... half Evangelicals believe Earth 6,000 10,000 years old. premise starts mess. “All Celiac disease stuff Chinese hoax make us buy rice China. Fear mongering! I’m afraid, can’t tell eat! statistics lies! GF stuff MADE UP.”🙄 seriously, nonsense hear covid totally mimics nonsense heard celiac 10 years ago, back crumbs dip made soooo sick. I’m pretty sure that’s doing. think it’s leisure travel. im guessing looked cases college cities past months. cases havent growing fast places, obviously cities controlling spread virus. start playing asap.

now lot misinformation circulating right covid cities, fake news propaganda machines saying: ""cases college cities becuase school bar closures"", ""more availability online college courses helps slow covid spread"", ""wearing mask lower oxygen levels"", (extra spicy lies), etc., I'm telling right theyre taking advantadge unaware people theyre bed mask producers, even doctors testifying paid companies LIE, think that. buddy military keeps telling dont even think virus real, cause hasnt ordered take hydroxychloriququine, doesnt make sense cause ive started taking today (got ebay Freedom Mind Makers) feel great, feel body prepping fight virus warming blood pushing old skin (its coming pretty easily). might working extra well, cause left side face left arm going numb. dont need sneaky doc telling do. goddamn, love country. 






/s first round increase cases driven getting testing started. Testing started ramp right around time deaths began take off. reality, case death delay somewhere 20-30 days.

On top that, better treating disease better overall understanding it. coupled younger demographic getting infected led slower increase deaths time.

That said, deaths still increasing rapidly, could easily get back close (might break 2k day again, maybe that). dude give us Clippie all. sock monkey computer angst. know that. basing comment wishful thinking. 

We know vaccine work, long last, people covid19 get again, kind long-term effects disease leave behind.

Maybe gone 18 months. Maybe won't. like trying predict stock market. Nobody really knows way go. 80-90% herd immunity theory old based everyone equally susceptible COVID, know true. stuff seeing days suggests 45%-70% range herd immunity, granted that's still feasible option, especially overshoot always possible. make difference comes herd immunity vaccination, especially vaccine partially effective.

Also antibiotics help viruses... sure meant that. saying. case, pick one less inconvenient logically justify it. badda-bing where's guy talking desantis like better cuomo? Maybe mask boarding refused keep boarded? Exactly someone using vaccines Microsoft us would say. media doesn’t say Foxnews reader. Yeah. can't disagree you. absolutely right. much damage done point level complacency state local governments regards mask wearing social distancing. measles vaccine pretty good one. It’s effective, even today outbreaks school closures small percentage use it. also took time eradicate measles USA

Now, imagine vaccine exist yet. pretend 10% population measles now. Vaccines come months . many states cooperate minimizing disease now. mention lot resistance vaccines now. lot people sick start vaccination ; health resources much strained now

And, even sure new vaccines good! country policy Sweden.... 

We closed fast hard schools reopened report zero deaths days. 

It simply virologists epidemiologists said it. even said secret policy government afraid say load. 

One economist joined choir regardless *not* policy government, people kept getting voices newspapers. 

After month people popping regularly major media outlets, government literally told head version CDC change mind speaking publicly again. 

I notice trump mentioned country already got schools reopened, expected citizens states little bit aware type forces thrown them. Sure seen people saying virus hoax made anti-trump people. thought people would interested kind garbage people actually told. definitely Bible told people get infected disease fast possible, trash science people definitely say things along line. Maybe humans natural predators complete shit. Average person, average IQ dude. Average person metrics median. Except one brought total numbers...

However - change fact *you live here*. happens piece land *matters,* love. apathetic, sure - that's always choice - harming engaging, option make difference? Keep mind well. almost like getting info lol.

Other lies, everything Birx said since day one people discussing weeks. saying hospital patient die don’t get paid life saving efforts put it? 
 
No. I’m saying all. fact I’ve clearly explained specifically I’m saying, you’re bending backwards understand.
 
Hospitals get paid death patient Covid. 
 
They get paid treating patient Covid. paid treatment. patient dies, payment treatment still exists - absolutely. get paid **for** death. 
 
There two distinct things discussing. Treatment vs. Death. one singular thing.
 You’re naive that’s ok. 
 
You probably cut back condescension. makes look silly you’re wrong.  LIAR. voted meth head! time people notice problem, late. We've seen again, learn hard way seems. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Maybe everyone needs get infected way get back normal? Isolated vaccine much. 

-GOP Weird got downvoted asking question, thanks input boss. second restaurants beaches opened like “let’s par-tay!!” *As passenger-tailored in-flight meal, recommend adult-portion baby food.* think you’re really stretching here. You’re fucking funny hell. “It’s like putting bandaid broken knee!” -Random firefighter movie “Volcano” starring Tommy Lee Jones Ann Heche point is? Fuck shit. Fuck take seriously. proactive like countries beat it. jobs sick time. full fine still? perspective, ground easily kick air. seems like thought ahead bit Slowly getting supply ready used. People sick covid-19 comes supply still sick weeks, possibly more.(possibly infecting others) possibly administered boosters retain potency. disinfo agents label 5g tech otherwise unsafe call people guinea pigs. Antivaxxers general. Also try calling family doctor office right see far booked November now. Yes near time highs market that’s matters! Ok... let's recap. got voted hell realize caps weekly monthly. one thread responded mentioned caps monthly that's work. 400$ originally talking additional unemployment beinifts unemployment. yes, guess correct one capped 320 less month.... Also grass purple bubbles pointy. assumed misspoke known saying completely obvious statement reason. NJ also covid deaths per capita: 1780/million. That’s double rate hardest hit european country (Belgium) three times Italy.

Edit: Downvoted stating facts. Check shit, Dr. Birx! happening places around world already picture snowstorms happening people stay inside big venues, i.e. police stations, welfare homes, churches, people's homes, etc. people wearing masks.

Holy moly gonna get bad. yeah, that's really dumb way look numbers. Stupid americans people LA support hosting Olympics? say would enough body bags basically competency looks like I’m trying downplay severity disease daily mortality rate still hovering around 1.4-1.7%. drastically different mortality disease spring spiked around 6.5%. suppose large decrease rate?  heartbreaking. time prepare... cool doubling amount deaths largest killer children country? even hear yourself? Im american. buy lot Chinese goods. Theyre usually trash. Trying defund testing tracing. Taking away data CDC funneling HHS. Lying mortality rates. Quid pro quo ventilators PPE. Trillions corporations Trumps donors, pittance American people going expire 3 days lot states.

Fuck fuck cult. Boise, ID left leaning? Florida left leaning? Texas left leaning? Get. The. Fuck. Out.

Edit: mask mandates, shelter place, shut down, mandates social distancing, still holding concerts events. could keep going broken anyway. matter say, content licking asshole people revel misfortune. Again, fuck you.  can't actually studying shit think eradication ever option discussed... really thing that, maybe find better school drop becaue wasted time money.  know anyone owns Lamborghini, know exist. restaurants still open take out. Salons still perform services outside.

And fuck about? *I live here.* furloughed three fucking months collecting unemployment, another three weeks returning work couple weeks got sick get tested Covid. I’m still collecting unemployment hours reduced fewer people shopping. (Widely, that!) husband also works retail.

It barely shut down. lot looser shutdown first one had. Worldometer. Look yourself. care keeping essential workers happy healthy, there's little it. Damn. Good luck :( still fully understand long term affects disease, afflict get ill. Rushing things seems foolish. getting really hard Dr Henry justify mask requirement. Plus, whole messaging masks weak. 

My guess forced mandate masking fairly soon, now. point stop spread gets control. 

I wonder people start asking public health officials update policies.  percentage whole.

First line. honestly hadn’t heard Scarlet Fever quarantine article, spoke mom lived it, it’s fascinating happened recently? feel different, definitely strikes notes tests equal positives negatives. Let’s settle down! mention death one part story. Even asymptomatic people organ damage.....that growing still developing body quite terrifying quit vaping December. difficult, difficult cigarettes. ended vaping 0 nic juice stopped cold turkey months. 

I found minty juice worked best get 0 nic get throat hit. Obligatory: post age like milk. Really I'm rooting success. Mainly one first tested vaccines global public good (as Americans) deserve; definitely best interests world. Big Pharma Stockholders. *Not yet* Yup. expected exactly happen. telling people back March, bet open soon August September, it’s worse now. are, late july, perfect timing schools open really blow thing fuck up.  hardly newsworthy guys really think gestapo dictator? asymptomatic cases beginning? MURIKA #1 deaths then?

I read voice Milhouse Van Houten. Maybe loud minority it- go always wear mask... customers well. I’m pretty rough area town, too. tried jogging wearing surgical mask. found getting breathless much earlier run, wearing mask.  doctor right, zero difference running mask, without mask. Exactly. easiest way make happen AOC say, “Trump can’t issue Federal mandate lacks authority.” willing catch Corona Virus course, say ""Fuck everyone else, plight important"" saying attack China??

/Ssssss earth sends kids camp ""fuck around drinking backyard""? Everyone know work. really hope not. Personally I'm still self isolating I'm deathly virus fucking organs. imagine would happen 40% hospitalized Covid patients permanent heart damage 30% patients (including asymptomatics) permanent lung damage? That's ~20% population, assuming 60% ends getting infected. People governments really start taking virus seriously. PREVENTABLE deaths! Thats sad part. frequency sirens definitely something stuck breakout. 

Dude Jersey City, NJ first weeks absolutely terrifying. rare hear sirens near house 2-3 weeks heard ambulance sirens passing house heard decades that. took someone personally knew died virus hearing nonstop sirens let know bad could be. spiders might big, machine guns. rich people corporations keep getting richer. Fuck kanye never said dumb, don’t want think that. think clearly extremely anxious, want people try give anxiety. Anxiety really harmful, situations like letting take small pieces control hurt you. 

If pregnant especially it’s normal anxious, give peace fight back it. Given fact risk certainly speak OB. disease generally transmitted prolonged contact. Drive thrus low risk. 

To explain virus bit concept called viral load. Essentially need high enough concentration virus make sick. Even tiny portion virus, it’s necessarily enough make sick. need sustained contact hit high concentration (such cough sneeze) really risk. 

If person wearing mask, normal drive encounter would say extremely low risk, even person wearing mask. 

If person working wearing mask would likely still fine. weren’t would also report Starbucks local health authorities. 

Stay healthy (this includes mental health too!) continue vaccine. Lots americans seem want end this. know action derive behavior. Fuck Disney Whorld open?!? fuck baseball starting??!? EARN THINGS stop spread. no... didn't, shits control. time next year.... stay rate increase... we'll something like 12 million affected 4220,000 dead. keep current course, cases increasing. probably much much higher. surprised hit 10 million cases &amp; 1 million deaths 1/1/2021. country survive november-pocalypse. dad died complications covid-19 death attributed since ton pre-existing conditions technically kidney failure resulting covid-19 clotting in. anything numbers lower actual deaths caused virus. Yup. comment totally tongue cheek here, “all buildings matter” course not, sister teacher I’m terrified go back.

You can't go back things normal, things normal. trend resume case numbers plateaued. comparing week week increases less percent seems straight retarded opinion, plus idea pulling numbers from.

june 24-30, daily case average 43k. july 1-7, average 53k. that's .2% week week increase, 23% increase. last 7 days, deaths 13% higher previous 7 days. second wave nothingburger. 1 1000 children could easily die car crash. 1 1000 perfectly acceptable risk. found friends entire family like that. ""Just wait goes away election!""

Oh casinos still open. bars open inside casinos. Fun fact, covid caught bar top.

Hey guess what!? governor wants child soldiers fight war!  you* every person different. also spreading dangerous ideas get people killed. hospitals getting fucking pittance compared able open normally allowed non emergency procedures like corona.  

So many hospitals running beds put people simultaneously laying non emergency workers 1 section hospital functioning isn’t paying bills anymore. People goddamn retarded. Go hell psycho. Ah right. Plus pandemics like Asian, HK Flu existed lifetime. USA! USA!  state fucks turned delapidated hospice center COVID death camp leaving people rot die ants crawling them.

Fuck texas. Fuck conservatives. Fuck every last motherfucker taking seriously. matter polls say. Liberals refuse vote. They'll happily declare _would_ vote for, never quite find ever actually enter voting booth. Liberals gladly enable second Trump term means mildly inconvenienced waiting line. benefits receptor terms evolutionary advantage? first place? would thought idiot demanding Obama resign single digit ebola deaths would completely ignore even bigger epidemic go golfing constantly instead dealing it. That's like GOP's entire platform. According crazies know, goal Democrats seize power. whole world got together ruined economies Democrats could finally destroy America. Republicans fault?

(About first paragraph ) ""we never go back normal"" mean then? According description first paragprah claiming virus ""fully eradicated earth"" agree doesnt mean never go back normal. lots viruses fully eradicated planet dont bother us long causing pandemics . ebola epidemic Africa speak , however mean never go back nromal ? 

-""For average person developed nations, vaccines largely “end pandemic” them."" 

yupp, pandemic end go back normal. Whether get immunity mass vaccination campaingns infection certain point wont neough susceptible people around keep pandemic going . Thats whole point . 

-""However, illness won’t go away everywhere once."" 

 means wont able fully eradicate virus , agree wont prevent communities going back normal. take bit longer expected maybe return normal. 

-"" following years, see occasional outbreaks places low vaccination rates among people dwindling immunity."" 

yupp POOR COUNTRIES example, may struggle low immuntiy may dal longer go back normal , specific communities wont. 

-""We don’t know long immunity lasts, vaccine natural immunity recovery, found empirically people become reinfected time."" 

If dont know shouldnt make claims like "" never go back normal "" right ? understand saying agree possibility vaccines may work effectively one would hope , reason claiming wont go back normal jst wrong. shoudlnt make claims certainty things ar unknown .Simply put dont know sure shouldnt make claims know sure. 

-""With said, get vaccine approved Stay informed get boosters necessary/suggested. personally get vaccine essentially free live life desired, however, mask mandates local laws general public atmosphere sports, concerts, etc may take little extra time “get back normal”. people vaccinated lingering outbreaks aren’t major risk people cannot receive vaccines, still required, society, remain vigilant."" 

Totally agreed.As said may take bit longer go back nromal. nothing evidence suggesting otherwise

-""People say never return normal alarmists.""  ""(and rest paragraph)"" : Yupp exactly whole point. reason assume that. 

-""It always possible mutations play role, close vaccine."" 

Yes course thing , LIKELIHOOD mutations mean never go back normal SURE. cant say based samll probablitiy. virus would suddenly reason start mutating massively extreme scenario like YES maybe consider fact may never go back normal cause absolutely case right now. expectation working vaccine soon enough heard immuntiy teh pandemic die that. Thats many scientists working vaccine, thats goalbasically. 

For rest comment, totally agree you. Basically even though virus may linger parts world specific groups etc , , general people developed countries GO back normal . Maybe soon would hope eventually achieve that. claim ""WE NEVER GO BACK NROMAL"" simply nothing baseless alarmist claim mentioned above. 

Thanks taking time posting long detailed comment.

Thumbs up. Nah businesses avoiding taxes could easily pay it. Sounds like something someone secretly wants microchip us would say line chart going downhill means deaths accelerating. Tl; dr Long term? It’s less 6 months places buddy 9 10 Americans IQ level higher number fingers have.  Except countries ignore fit little agenda 🤷‍♀️ America, never ever let people feel financially secure. nervous wrecks always wondering they'll lose little  cause people develop issues lack oxygen. 

Yes, decades PPE wearing medical industrial personnel taught nothing.

Please show --- decades mask wearing many professions --- causes people develop issues lack oxygen, breathing particles mask etc. life speechless. Thanks Rona Ron “I pretend it’s ‘calling people out’ whenever yell people small acts justice, regardless whether know they’re large acts justice not. kind makes feel better taking small steps myself, knowing acts, small large, useless stop world’s evil, comfort boycotting chicken sandwich least I’m self-righteously like guys.” makeshift hospitals setup Texas actually. they're far worse normal hospital. There's company called Krucial running them, conditions pretty terrible, outcomes equally terrible end one. Here's one made news ants crawling patients, patients getting oxygen replaced often enough keep alive horrible say way without inside. outside, looks pretty clear comes greed. There's staff members, little PPE (that's common issue around US), paruse nursing sub-reddit, find loads stories management care long continue make ton money. Also note there's another huge hospital right next makeshift one zero COVID patients, keep one ""clean"" use elective surgeries...

Du bist lustig für einen Deutschen 😎  Driving past homeless areas I'm at, they're /socializingtalking neighbors without masks.

SUUUUUUUCK. need wear brief interaction masks okay, anything longer 30 minutes amount condescension build unbearable. ordered reusable one See Smile. I'm keeping fingers crossed one user friendly high hopes. It’s extremely bad scale. Natural selection best at. Imagine there's heaven... Oh yeah, huh. There's topic drift there's TOPIC DRIFT. mess Texas. Wear masks.

Transmission households cut lot everyone wears masks.

Honestly, got someone high risk household, start wearing masks study found households everyone wearing face mask indoors precaution knew anyone lived sick, risk transmission cut smart guy here. unlucky surrounded ignorant people. Stay strong friend. Okay, let ask you, outside, objective observer.

What think we're saying? think he's saying?

I mean sincerely, btw, trying dick anything. really want know. vaccine candidate currently undergoing Phase 3 trial UAE, similar Sinovac's vaccine candidate undergoing Phase 3 trial Brazil also inactivated virus vaccine.

Here phase 3 trial details:

http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=56651 predicted February pretty cool That's nice story, really disprove said. Even scenario unfolded describe, would rare. early decisive lockdown would greatly reduced overall number new cases, rare instances follow scenario outlined would much easier existing public health officials identify perform contact tracing on, letting isolate quarantine people father contact end lockdown first time showed symptoms. That's feasible (and effective) 10-100 people infected/exposed. realistic 100,000 people are.


And I'm trained pathologist - doctoral research actually focused disease *transmission*.   I'm....sorry? Even though AZ governor issue statewide mask mandate, least he's trying stop local jurisdictions issuing them. Yes Italy spain China. (Citation needed) ""If virus kills people, dead yet, HUH!?""

Yeah, asshole Karen signs test, leaves can't wait longer, inform anyone left, fucks registration information everyone behind her. numbers still completely correct, idiots screwing patient information. jesus christ we're like 3-4 weeks this, last time 3 months in... we're ride want :( Wow, Thanks man. Yeah I'm good healthy. heartwarming see comment. Take care friend. general mortality rate always around 1% cases. course depends plenty factors, age, hospital capacity increased knowledge virus meaning better preventing deaths.

With hospitals overrun south, mortality rate obviously increase. initial surge among younger people, they're taking beds, leaving none older people risk dying. likely could referencing. One national press conferences covered reopening schools time fall; pressed, one official said student death rate would low, around 1.4%. That's around 13,000 school-age children expecting die. Plus whomever infect home. It’s true Medicare pays COVID-19 treatments. However, there’s extra compensation saying COVID-19 contributing cause death. Basically, get paid (and patients Medicare) administering treatments COVID-19. compensate hospitals financial losses due switch focus treating COVID-19 patients. Financially speaking, doesn’t make sense bill something isn’t COVID related COVID-19 treatment non-COVID treatments usually pay hospitals anyways.

For example car crash victim comes needs taken emergency surgery. Now, would hospital bill ventilator treatment related COVID billing treatments actually performed (surgery, anesthesia, drugs administered, etc.) would result making money? answer wouldn’t. Honestly stressful time pregnant. hope wearing mask washing hands etc. Chances getting sick short interaction low. Take care mental health! means try worry things take one day time. congratulations kid be! tell masks protect u 5g bill Gates hates masks. :/s see, thank anyway honest - maybe another one knows origin. Crickets renob questioning you. That's insane (or even equal middle class sense)

Again, happening, anywhere. one previously making enough money support middle class lifestyle making much unemployment, even current bonus. mathematically wish distributed fairer way

The thing that's unfair current distribution poor (*not* middle class) people going back work making much still unemployment. best course action would employers pay more, already underpaid back things ""normal"", happen. *second* best course action would government supplement wages make much would unemployment, crisis over.

What would *not* good solution government eliminate reduce current unemployment bonus. People not, means, encouraged go back work right now. Making people go back work increase public health risk, bad everybody. Furthermore, enough jobs currently unemployed people go back to, eliminating reducing current unemployment bonus inevitably lead people unable pay rent, bills, expenses, leading mass evictions, increased homelessness, worsening public health situation. current rate unemployment benefits still barely minimum amount needed survive month-to-month many large cities. lower people fall cracks. way eliminating reducing unemployment bonus good fairer anyone. confusing color scale ever seen. could’ve chosen literally anything else would better. That's quote says. quote says hospital position residents (of Starr County) socially distance. Urine better eating whole cow.  Florida, California, Texas count majority. I’m jealous winning Americans Yes. think I'd able much cardio 8 tshirt layered mask strapped face. Doable, I'm pretty sure I'd pass run. 

I really test though....maybe shoild wear helmet. much winning man high tower take time go golfing more.  Sadly accurately describes fucking lot Americans care work with. better. people year die automobile accidents US asshole thinking shouldn’t shut roads preventable deaths.

""Only"" 30k people year die automobile accidents US extensive life preservation technologies regulations place. Would ok seatbelts speed limits eliminated ""only"" 30k people dying year? Okay, well maybe need relax get enraged different opinion internet.

Is kind smug power trip you? really know anger coming from. opinion current events.

Nobody town wears mask worries anyway.  say based on? Lol soon doubt amount deaths. know much virus then. tri-state area first huge outbreak US due density + lack preparedness + lack leadership government, surprising shit show. People get tested unless needed hospitalized, bad. Testing lot better that's even testing right now.

People wearing masks social distancing. might everyone even people it, makes difference.

This said, time tell. jump driving nuts. guys EXACT points, guy saying. Everything said, agrees with. bonking man points, unsuccessfully trying tell you. Funnily enough Vietnam 0 deaths Covid.


So Vietnam 2 USA 0 see endgame here. People gonna stop showing work see colleagues die. you’re going cite wearing masks settled science. That’s ridiculous. That’s like saying wearing hat keep head warm. doesn’t take genius determine either those. yes, people still aren’t wearing masks. people also don’t wear hats it’s cold. 

I say anything things severe expected. People like leap conclusions minute anyone questions anything. It’s you’re looking fight. fact “experts” still know little virus, may know before, still know little. Meanwhile, studies studies, little data, drawing many conclusions, conflict one another. “scientists” unquenchable desire adjudicate state pandemic public arena, that’s one stupidest things I’ve ever seen. it’s inciting discord making people much skeptical reliability what’s purported scientific data. don’t even reliable data U.S., let alone anywhere else world. appears India finally come startling conclusion infection rate severely underreported, possibly factor 10. surprise! please continue demand people “follow science”, whatever is. I’m sure makes feel better. 

The knee-jerk reactions questions “science” tiresome. sets fairly dangerous precedent. can't anything private land landowners could start shit replace fairs cancelled. county use five refrigerated trucks hold 50 bodies each.

Per article, county 180 deaths last week. gonna need trucks soon. Yeah, run beds CFR goes way due lack adequate medical care. Please show proof this? many getting infected cured, definitely statistics this. shaky fictional writing talent. Tell restaurants salons shutdown. go like know everything anecdotal experience, many Californians unemployed mandatory shutdown. Welcome Vancouver! many thoughts well. think biggest issue mandated masks went uncontested we've opened bigger worms allowing greater powers presidency be. People willing grant additional executive powers, even states emergency. Ironically, people calling presidential mandate opposed other, less questionable executive mandates. opposed extensions executive power, ones suit us. one way valve. Assuming one tight seal: filters like proper n95 inhalation, exhale releases valve allows respiratory droplets leave unfiltered, exposing others. indiabanana?  


stronk 191 call think America Never, u can't cure stupid. Shithole gotta shitholey. Fuck hate find leftover smallpox. It’s hard use historical data predict future events, especially realm extremely rare catastrophic pandemics.

I’m saying won’t, saying extremely severe second wave x times worse first pure speculation based closest related event past 150 years. funny moves keep making? I'm sure mean mass testing, tracing isolating confirmed.

Realistically, probably max $220,000-$250,000 range like benefits California. Yeah we’re gonna get real indoor dining back till vaccine. It’s risky. That's good work. anybody wants come say numbers whack, flu like 0.1%, flu numbers *estimated* infected fatality rate, case fatality rate. broke tooth go dentist. fine I'm glad went. stress this. partner fine. know lot people kinda feel way Oregon, deaths cases compared many states. Still well written. I'm Virologist know enough know least 90%+ correct (probably more)\*. End day known facts stand merit need said Dr. Fauci true.

Thanks reply :) Stay safe.

\*I know chickenpox cause shingles would research virus continues live body individuals some. I'm lazy, might look later.

**EDIT:** appears correct, virus seems recede nerve cells remain dormant. get shingles reactivation. . IIRC two *different* methods viruses stay body long times. Indiana. won’t. nothing struggling breathe. everything self-centred people think one else. Wow. 4 days 49 views. go show em...  really gonna tell hospital worker that's upset deaths cringe? yikes, cut edge  know you’re facetious story SARS vaccine actually interesting, particularly context current crisis attempt rapidly develop COVID-19 vaccine. yes, continue work MERS vaccine... fact unable produce one successfully give everyone pause timelines we’ve hearing vaccine ready. We’ve known MERS since 2012 think 2017 able reach phase convalescent antibody treatment let alone vaccine candidate. research timeline COVID-19 severely compressed doesn’t come without consequences... lot shots goal we’re essentially taking shots dark. lot companies, like Moderna, seem jumping opportunity test concept behind proprietary biotechnology platforms rather optimally defeating disease don’t lot data / research take meticulous, focused approach. 

And I’m worried idea vaccine right around corner makes people drop guard get little lax measures actually use effectively stop pandemic getting worse. Vietnam: 408 cases | 0 deaths

Gee, rocket science...  Don’t benefit free testing patients alive? makes sense. Time start cutting fingers Even outside sub, mentioned reddit still quarantining, either get laughed downvoted. know maybe 1% people quarantining like me. 

People ask me, “what going next time? Go back house again? Live life like that?”

I dunno! right now, seems safe thing 8732 PCR tests Arizona. Another day failing. people cite NYT article saying probably cant get reinfected.

It's feeling like February people sticking heads sand denying what's happening.

/s Dumb gets dumber passing day. literally statement Onion. point bet DeSantis bipolar Kanye. ish make sense! Mike Ryan WHO, one: World Health Organisation condemned “dangerous” concept herd immunity managing coronavirus Michael Ryan, executive director WHO’s health emergencies programme said wrong think countries “magically” make populations immune Covid-19.
It reported March UK government hoping achieve herd immunity allowing virus make way population. Health secretary Matt Hancock denied ever part government Ryan told press briefing Geneva: “Humans herds, and, such, concept herd immunity generally reserved calculating many people need vaccinated population order generate director added: “So think idea ‘maybe countries lax measures haven’t done anything sudden magically reach herd immunity, lose old people along way?’ really dangerous, dangerous alone: mainstream consensus regarding disease novel pathogens. one advocated herd immunity Ebola Marburg, two recent pathogens. SARS 1 contained via aggressive tracking tracing. done China start COVID, may situation now. Going herd immunity novel pathogen simply reckless unethical. ridiculous lol USA would people find shocking it. Fuck education system country. Another Tennessean reporting FUCK BILL LEE Thats 2020 logic Narcissistic sociopaths. That's like arguing payday loans fantastic Chinese debt diplomacy may seem relevant Americans, serious threat U.S. national security. directly, China’s crafty negotiations seizure strategic assets limit U.S. influence access overseas. instance, tiny country Djibouti home significant American military base Africa. Thanks Chinese loans, Djibouti’s debt-to-GDP ratio surged from 50 85 percent 2014 2016. Djibouti default relinquish port resupplies U.S. base, American military capability Africa Middle East could seriously threatened.
More broadly, unsustainable levels debt destabilize African states, also compromises American security interests. Over-leveraged governments get caught downward spiral of credit downgrades, reckless economic policies, reduced spending social services. economic stagnation comes fewer opportunities Africa’s fast-growing young population. toxic brew economic hopelessness political disillusionment drive disaffected youth toward violent extremism. threaten Americans abroad and, potentially, even home.
Finally, China’s debt diplomacy shuts opportunities U.S. businesses. Beijing’s cheap infrastructure loans come conditions employ Chinese companies, also set technical specifications projects like high-speed railways wireless networks manner favors Chinese firms. combined effect efforts “would push United States away current position global economy move China toward center,” according to Jonathan Hillman, fellow Center International Strategic Studies. China already earns $180 billion annually from investments Africa; debt diplomacy remains uncontested, it’s likely even revenues jobs flow China, instead U.S. remember months ago Floridaman shitting NYC's response would never happen Florida. showed article governors hiding obfuscating corona stats. hope he's still alive see dumb was. really gone hung anyone? risk scenario low attend ceremony see sis get married  cost millions lives can't follow playbook countries already perfected. Herd immunity called is, survival fittest. leaders animals men. That’s quite cool habit. stress pandemic social media worst place could be. sub nothing people pessimistic viewpoints saying ""Florida fucked"" ""the Republicans blame everything"" over.  happy instead alternative. alternative herd immunity still sure even achievable regardless cost high.

We knew bad. World emergency (not pandemic, bad) declared. China built make shift hospitals week. Hundreds dead already. Stories people falling dead street.

Most people put head sand

But public knowledge honestly stupid sell live town population 800. school unable opening august 19th option learn home, putting much pressure teachers even tech person all.

Edit: also, good chunk students internet home parents willing make schoolwork, matter.

Jacksonville Jaguars RULE!!! People keep repeating China stole technology yet say stole lol.

If proof China stole you, sue them.

**China increasingly preferred venue patent litigation, even US patent owners** 

Therefore, years, decades, world denigrating China’s intellectual property protection enforcement, China quietly building capability protect IP China, “build court patent system pro-innovator.”

“China new IP super-power,” said LexisNexis experts.

As legal frameworks, contract law, China patent system decades ago. China “poised take IP systems world.”

What really need take number tested die, examine (a) age demographics, (b) whether symptomatic. 

It's near impossible compare Florida New York assume, without knowing, Florida WAY tests available New York beginning, Florida testing way YOUNG people symptoms, thus making huge number cases necessarily par New York terms expect death rates. 

Does anyone know get data from?

UPDATE: people downvoting actually use **words** explain issue is? agree numbers, presented, like comparing apples oranges, explain why. said, New York testing height crisis **most** people tested OLDER SICK. Florida, contrast, testing now, hospitals overwhelmed, suspect, WITHOUT KNOWING, testing YOUNGER folk HEALTHY. such, would like see that's true, so, expect number deaths coming florida would otherwise expected based case rate New York, knowing information important PROJECTING DEATHS (which I'm focused here). I'm really happy worked out. Hope help people same. reporting number Covid deaths propoganda? sold portfolio days ago. might miss percent high end, coming crash going brutal.

The Federal Government gave Wall Street enough $ build bridge future prosperity, built ski jump it. everybody's going land safely side. need strict shutdown everything non-essential, mandatory mask real enforcement least 1-2 months.

It's tough pill like saying, half baked cake cake all. explain crazy spike babies Texas. Unless contract union signed district states teachers can’t go strike non contract negotiating year INSANE me. Melbourne announced 6 week lockdown mandatory mask wearing. past weeks cases started increasing getting 400+ new cases day. country whole total 128 COVID deaths. 

I guess we’re lucky mostly accessible social welfare system place. It’s absolutely competition. Health vital part economic competitiveness. America failing issues health now, excuse pun “fever pitch” issues.

2021 - 2024 see massive massive declines lose global competition production consumption. Hang there, man... youll get point India laugh it. It’s gotta get it. math wrong, would 370 deaths. personally want hear anything politics. Corona beyond all, people dying don’t think it’s correct time try score political points. Criticize policy, person. governors every major state screwed up, red blue, worse others. people don’t want hear politics wrong. may convince leave politics it. 

I’ve seen many Trump haters board publicly praise commend certain statements, much Trump bungled corona response, gets right, screw politics. support whatever saves lives. may believe Covid, Covid believes you. Freakin Boomerville. bit complicated that, especially year... yes, incredibly important everyone vote however dismiss urgency polling. colds bad feels like flu.

I get one year seems lately. basically use liquid Children's Benadryl deal normal cold meds nothing. 5g bill gates may give autism /s Bill Gates wants force us get vaccine initiate mind control scheme activating nanobots 5g Yes, sorry. know US numbers  introversion great asset times! fucking hanover's man I’d probably okay that. speed limit Autobahn fine. Fancy glam twitter photos. guess there's things harder understand someone snapping loved one gets needlessly led death boss/employer...
So sad. California 80% businesses follow COVID guidelines. Perfect libertarianism works everyone's rational. There's reason there's government, mandate laws seatbelt, drunk driving, mask-wearing. Trump's delicious chicken nuggets. hospitals start overflowing people start dying place, yes. Nuke space. way sure... 7 thousand 150 thousand bad. Light smoker 10 years, quit unintentionally pandemic stopped going outside lol. consider going hunger strike Half-Life 3 comes out, show him. saying mainly happening Melbourne Sydney, whereas Western Australia , South Australia Northern Territory especially handled exceptionally well. rebrand war healthyness. got clear winner. Yes! read! know sharp drop daily deaths link?

Towards end even goes projection universal masks. I’m curious know hospitals normally function reduced services. work ICU 17 bed capacity city around 100,000 also function trauma centre surrounding rural communities. summer it’s bad flu season regularly function around 100-110% capacity PAR ED holding couple patients. went lock reduced functions like elective surgeries like 50-75% capacity. live BC Canada fortunate almost cases outside 6 outbreak first started.  said 150k people die given day. deaths would come heart disease cancer. good chunk could come issues hunger. Americans move Canada this? think stockpiles ammo reserves ~~rainy~~ fascist day mean shit current military's strength I've got land torpedo sell you. Trump: disappear 

*we reopen everything, virus disappear*

Trump: *shocked pikachu face* “These solid numbers. Real flexing hour”

-	America probably - They’ve ramping Sinophobia lately. I’m sure they’ll find something new blame China for. I'm thick skulled, I'm realist - shit go next 3-5 years giving plenty time people good job first 2% entire pandemics life plenty time catch up. Apparently people sending kids covid parties....ffs people stupid also falsifying death rates mislabeling reason death ""pneumonia"" cases. Thank you! two swear it’s someone two accounts statements written manner. 

And I’m chick. damn blows, usually go menthol flavors know would help? mask requirement. 

At point pandemic, negligent one. 

Everyone loves Henry, point start question policies? 

Her position blame people bad behaviour, policies never questioned anything bad happens blamed populace, policies. vaccine 8 months away best third country say won’t take Yup, get virus people die faster others range 14-45 days people dying trying fight it. 

Then delay reporting 30 days. 

All cases climbing past 30 days? They're start show death column now. people screaming 'where deaths?! show deaths?!' get words rammed right back throat. United States already tried buy German vaccine, French vaccine. Chinese come vaccine, stopping United States buying Chinese vaccine?  heard before. mentioned documentary ‘How Survive Plague’ early days AIDS epidemic. Really lets know government's priorities are, it? I'd like see science this. they're, Molson. Didn’t change CPR guidelines back? chest compressions? furloughed 2 weeks. time qualified basically maximum Minnesota, $479 per week.

$479×4 + $400 = $2316 per month.
My mortgage $1703. Utilities runs another $150. Health insurance another $266. would give less $200 per month everything else - car insurance, internet, cell phone, food, gas, etc.

It could done. Dude. saying ""won"" argument refusing even engage acknowledge someone disagrees could arguing good faith. snotty hardly gloating. Get reading comprehension. Instead fighting virus, US using federal paramilitary officers fight people. Yeah, real lives hanging balance due contracting virus, too. feel like I’m gambling health every day go work.

But economists agree full shutdown paid people stay home, less people would suffer now. half measures working. proposing, reopen? solution? I'm early 20's person. I'll admit careful lately. spent March June going all,not even get groceries. I'm getting tired. go buy stuff(groceries,take out) regularly now. I've gone twice month(two week quarantine times), visit friends, theme park. 

I know risks. point I'm tired. live roommate interact share spaces except kitchen. Even shelves halves stove. figure get get bad shitty genetic luck. 

That said, live people would WAAY careful. family, especially family fell risk category, things did. 

This pure selfishness.  Sounds like Bolsonaro cause.

Again, perhaps communication thing strong point. *How America exist* ;.; /British people support Trump Fauci entirety Republican party. They're base. many Republicans side science Fauci. one said 'entire Republican party'. Trumps's base loyal Trump. That's real danger. height self-centeredness. mind-numbing. argument dude work. Really? global pandemic ploy target conservatives US? fuck's sake.. father's response grandkids going elementary school August: ""People die flu time hear them."" I'm ok Grandma V guilt tripped visiting 90th birthday. kept 6 feet part wore masks. considering way talking March lock think knows die Covid-19 something else. She(and Grandpa V) talked way Grandma L talked 96th birthday 5 months died. saying last generation(brother/sisters/most in-laws/cousins). Grandma L seen 3 stepsons die Cancer, Stroke, Parkinson's nearly lost youngest aneurysm. Grandma Grandpa V lost son cancer. Without border control, handling pandemic federalism system joke. needs exceptions, covid-19 exception. states needs follow unified federal response. Statistician fell window. get head Merkel. not, state media overall unaffiliated trustworthy, polarized US mor disciplined trust science whole different level magnetude US. low cohesion cultural connection societal branches even comprehend Germany country works. 

The thing US interested personal freedom freedom all. two totally different approaches freedom two different levels responsibility anyone. Germany Germans least underlying principle engrain Ed beeing.

Ever since overly leftist approach personal freedom started growing Germany gets worse worse. Berlin epitome american ""for me"" way life Germany. looked history book pandemic, would say still early stages, know exponential growth virus due ability spread. makes think ""basically eradicated"" value, years go takes one case see exponential growth? tests days done using CDC test. 🏆🥇good job guys! We're great! FML Sounds like Russian troll :P /s

cute name btw also double population Extended? Yeah saw interactions Facebook Instagram really matter state worst? affects us. feel like headline needs another comma forget inviting everyone state come spend money here! Visitors accounting cases hospitals. enough hospital beds residents, much less tourists. many people total normally die 1 day across United States? thought ""death okay long someone care about"". bad thing we’re setting record can’t even trust numbers need reported White House took reporting. condolences losses. :( sarcastic, make solid point.

If think COVID conspiracy, excess death numbers going convince you. shuts people means they've learned talking point shoot yet. 

Theyve lot practice. Every time weather cold go ""so much global warming"" regularly break global temperature records. questioned theyll say faked, natural variation, stopped now, ice age would worse, solution X bad reasons might well destroy human civilization. locals wanted stay closed opened restrictions BC lifted. pissed (rightfully so) fishing charters still flying people in. Ah, ""Home Alone"" approach. obtuse. Sending kids school pandemic one worst possible things could do- children community large. Kids absolutely die (not seems bother much), cases exponentially increase pandemic spreading towards parents, teachers, staff, etc etc. 


Having virtual school semester two mitigate risk. Ie, like car seats mitigate road deaths. called Wave 1.5 bit, realized we'll mask mandates soon tamp down. mandates probably removed, rates go *before* we've hit expected 2nd wave. 

So, need proper nomenclature, rather try shoehorn something 1 2. Thus, call current wave 1.1, next 1.2; winter flu season wave 2.0. may even 2.1, vaccine slow roll governors remove restrictions early - time Trump hopefully office we'll someone competent instead. even smart enough note responding insipid comments, link attempting spoof real website.

Do due diligence prior clicking links these. Sorry loss. Hopefully things change soon. least US ha shown us future pandemics couple hundred Americans died Battle Hue Vietnam War, point Americans really started say, ""enough enough.""

How many enough time? Shut up? Lol. 

And that's even simp modern context. 

Whats wrong 11 kids? like humans?  I'm NWI well. used lift PNW. PNW place they're damn slow formulating strategy. area bad practicing social distancing mask usage, shudder think much worse rest state is. Also hard hear parents Grandma's sacrifice S&amp;P500 celebrated. coverage necessarily avoid medical bankruptcy. may covered still out-of-pocket bill, would surprised shit insurance companies pull deny coverage stuff (e.g. ""oh hospital network, unconscious seen nurses doctors happen network, covered. also we're denying coverage treamtents XYZ becuase deemed medically unnecessary bad sad conscious refuse care network doctor said would died without them, disagree"") Pro. Pa. Gan. Da. india usa.

Quoted posterity barely shutdown somehow affecting millions Californians? 

Get high horse, real lives hanging balance. possible EMS instructed treat every call potential COVID case use PPE accordingly. Since never pro mask, reluctant backtrack mask position. 

She's trying justify saying requirements ""heavy handed"" better ask people nicely. 

There lot things society required, that's pretty lame.

She want blow back her, really likes popularity. keep saying policies great, people's behaviour problem. 

This weak bad policy. BC one last places require masks hospitals!! BC CDC website *still* says masks ""personal choice""!! Except weekly percentage total increased cases 5 straight weeks starting June, deaths increased 3 straight weeks. Completely nonessential 

Shut WeLl arEnT hoMElEss popUlations WIpeD 

That's friend Facebook. mean homeless they're dying never know anyway Oh wow thanks!! numbers limited United States? know, actually think issue criticizing wrong thing. knows hospitals rightly getting money, he's considering receiving money increased treatment COVID patients death. saying death, read article know semantics. believe hospitals actually getting money. need another Fauci speech like this. Lol I'm waiting 10 year longitudinal study get vaccine. Oh, bad. Really really bad policy. I’m judging based posts I’ve seen crying fake news refrigerated trucks Texas guys pictures wearing jackets beanies. 🙄 difficulty breathing, scale 1 -10

1: wearing paper mask N95/P100 exhaust valve new 9/11 every third day. one cares   Harry Podder Yup apparently hospitals get $13K per ""corona death"" according co-worker CANADA places.  wearing mask wouldn’t affect deaths. Masks protect people you, people.  South West's turn unfortunately. hope sarcasm, case isn't: people die scared go hospital Covid, would dying part Covid. count them, without covid would died. think government force people shut businesses. personal choice. walmarts smart, stationing ""security"" guards door people likely going comply intimidated, bring police risk looters. perfect storm private security companies IMHO. life goes on. Antivaxxers figure one day (maybe), can't wait get vaccine get it. RIP seafood business makes money importing China. Second outbreak row linked seafood importers going Chinese consumer trusting imported seafood long time. shit Kids died this. 73.7 million kids US, say 50% get it- that’s roughly 37 million kids....even death rate 0.001% that’s 37,000 dead kids. 
 
Not mention possible lasting organ damage hell lot that. Thanks! that.


(hah hah) Seriously, thank you. said it’s happening. trying say I’m said, multiple times, happening? said much lighter version original barely anything all. It’s much smaller shutdown. 

And say it’s joke?

Seriously, fuck off. Oh no, could happened? Dang, that's spirit! everyone thinks way, yeah, we'll never see cooperation. thought going close those, least, locals trying get closed. Toss surgical mask valved N95 you’d boss protecting others. shadowy puppet masters benefitting that? 

This ask people go flat earth conspiracy. apparently ""the government"" group trying hide fact Earth flat... why? Holy shit didn’t think that! whole chloroquine thing. invested chemical company suggested help absolutely proof concern human safety, profits. June 22.... ""We never thought Covid. idea.""... Why?! would think abnormal change health behavior anything once-in-a-century pandemic raging country surging state?

Guys, education problem. Full stop. rookie numbers. 9 million people die every year hunger. Covid 19 weak af. people usa probably die fat.  think pfizer usually like 20b revenue something yeah cool free $2b dope moon shot like would companies me, logo look much like one Onion ""news""?  30,000 people die every year flu (this number fluctuates based severity season/the effectiveness vaccine season).

Covid killed 100k months. totally skipped hurricane season. Remindme! 30 days Well cared enough reroute PPE going countries. wrong, health departments thing Mexico, Argentina Ireland. sob stories fail mention person died obese land whale taken better care health momen saw title knew scumbag prick asshole Paul Brothers. Yep! hope gloss comments little, worth getting arms this. Fauci holds ton sway (obviously moreso left), respect done world, words could oversimplified cause people lot needless fear.  I've given deniers. Even medically diagnosed covid dying it, last words would be: ""its democratic hooooaaaaaax!!!""..Sigh. 

You can't help people like that. kind shove corner keep eye them. Make sure much damage. Deaths lag behind cases get tested eventually die dying takes weeks lol

People don’t understand stats America almost 150k official deaths. numbers want see? 

Interestingly North America surpassed Europe now, smaller population time prepare. two dangerous. Otherwise it’s 100% parent make happen (or air-travel them). Idc hard is. guarantee allowed state and/or federal law. one get day court. Meanwhile, protest, even peacefully, snatched streets goons camo. So, recourse courts, recourse protest. Who's going blink? good news. Dude, [air rage thing decades Airlines procedures yanking people planes, good reasons (drunk asshole) bad (oops, airline overbooked flight, gtfo) No. understand analogy, maybe that's fault explaining well enough. understand analogy really addressing argument unproductive. cbf trying explain again. governors still using police effectively end protests riots. week 8 non-stop public gatherings. I'm going go limb say people tenuous grasp reality, regardless work.

""They put Covid death cert tested positive, actually died it."" responding hoax anyways. Anyone high school education know can't case. time stop responding kind statements make masks mandatory, period. Nothing else mandatory masks,you selfish anti-maskers, anti-vaxxers, racist bigots fuck fantasy land pay huge fine everytime find without mask. Lol course getting downvoted. Watch moron tell protests actually quite safe really problem. Reddits double standards fucking insane.

EDIT: keep completely inane justifications coming, quite entertaining. US reached TRIAGE level infected Oo that's crazy get shit together strategy dictates waiting bad thing happens taking steps combat it.

Why people treat proactive like taboo? emphasis proactive? Yup, virus lives (sections of) nervous system. got chickenpox 2, shingles 18. 10 years later nerves left arm (where shingles) still right, another barely-understood neurological condition hard wonder might different I'd given chickenpox vaccine... :/ EXACTLY! much Fauci done us, fear monger point. risks injecting narrative going run away itself. realistic basing behavior data, line drawn. vaccine out, life needs go on, need start accepting risks come human - lest lost humanity. mass shooters comment? realize he’s correct, right? *you’re* correct, *your* I've sent Twitter coverage DHR COVID ""hospital"" KTLA. WTF, TX? online friend lives Cali she’s always talking new housemates, guess that’s sort norm struggling actors/actresses? Face shields masks meant go together.... flu.... Baton Rouge, Louisiana Coronavirus testing literally gone shit it. I’m fine. sick three days lingering symptoms.

Either longer thought got 12/6 12/20 Northern California two weeks. hometown South Bend / Mishawaka online schooling many districts there. Genuinely shocked Jersey (where live) still going open schools places northern Indiana weren’t, regardless fact Jersey good. seems reckless situation me. manager another coast! Luckily parent company extended WFH though end year. NY 10% deaths nursing homes. FL, 50%. guy says shocking things get name headlines. guy said ""we never shake hands again"" months back, he's playing media.

While rest world recovering going back normal America ( countries also led incompetent morons ) still getting worse day. main respected medical expert whole country goes saying stuff like this.

America really joke. healthcare workers could leave countries eventually consequence said everywhere..... true April May, outbreak mostly isolated New York/northeast. 


There hotspots across country now. Well, I'm Texas, big republican, sure size political bent determining factor. unless reading website wrong, 11.3% total tests, today. read elsewhere happened first nun took sick refused tested account wish worry sisters. long 13, including herself, died. reading Article, certainly believe Dr. Fauci Trump. But, matter, good news. want workplace injury lawsuits. shopping Lowe's. world would visit grandparents going party? people stupid selfish? hope too. live area people screaming “kids need school!” hear is, “I demand free child care, *my* kid isn’t going die care?” Keep praying complaining ""your rights"". fix Thanks breakdown. seems... optimistic yet horrifying. 

RemindMe! August 30 starters, China probably help vaccinate entirety Africa sending US, even Trump begs

But moot point, Trump ""says"" irrelevant, guy think dementia test hard said wished Ghislaine Maxwell well, unprompted said meet many times.

I think brain even registered sound came mouth. knew cuz gop mascot. Health professional wise? few. edit: us grant money pays almost none R&amp;D (in general). Cost market drug \~2.6 Billion. Grants order hundred thousand million. Arizona? Governor Ducey? listening? ""Does meat taste like virus?""  Unfortunately, everyone wasting time trying convince people currently wearing masks. care going start now.

They've made mind going stick it, even kills them. It’s annoying, everywhere go people wearing nose mouth, it’s like what’s point. It’s thing people put seatbelt put strap behind back, things minor inconveniences you’re making uncomfortable unsafe time Probably percent think trump good job pandemic Okay, sorry, hard disagree statement Sweden somehow disproved bad death rate. currently seventh entire world deaths that's tiny population dense. take San Marino Andorra tiny outbreaks, they're fifth. success. 

Secondly, something everyone keeps shutting eyes fact country unique approach pandemic differently. HUGE problem Sweden people claim nobody whole wide world ever needed lockdown. partly Sweden controversial remain so, lot people anti-lockdown want able use Sweden example. 

The thing is, work. ton different factors go necessity lockdowns, including testing, tracing, population density, mask prevalence, social distancing, access hygiene, progression contagion decision made lockdown etc, etc. black white 'omg nobody needed lockdown'.

As everything else mentioned, see possibly make sorts claims right firm stats. deaths cases least discuss everyone point pandemic. Quite frankly, also depends person's personal priorities imagine many people would prefer economic hit loss family members friends. factors also exist like country's social safety net. 

But considering subs post in, I'm going guess going woosh right head. nice night. Yeah guidelines full lot wishful thinking.  ""Sam Lee, junior University Georgia, claims failed online test … well … dinner.

Does sound better worse stories people post here?  Take vote go sit corner. know done. Pay attention professions industries affected stuff like this. Plan career accordingly. What’s cure? understanding... even treatment mortality rate still 10-15% Literally exactly we've shouting would happen. study Europe indicating may becoming ""weaker"". research indicating maybe effective transmitting stronger spike proteins, less likely break evolved. knows viral disease really comparable antibiotic-susceptible disease like plague. Rabies endemic wildlife, still certain death get point showing symptoms. deaths also lag takes time process death certificate employers need charged shit like Yeah, pretty stupid nose poking out...  like going consciously remember breathe entire time out. likely.

Thanks, captain obvious. What's procedure? Stop spreading misinformation pandemic. It’s sort problem. like told us masks help prevent covid infections start this?  
Remember cause do. point cares February? 5 months enough foresight know need masks lockdown yet aren’t lazy click (and thinking already (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines (LUV.N) said Wednesday eliminating exemptions face-covering requirement except children 2 years old, toughest policy yet among U.S. Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) followed suit similar order later Wednesday. mean paid COVID patients? Hospital economics getting destroyed COVID. Several reasons:

1. COVID patients tend stay long time hospital. Hospitals give bill / get paid patient leaves. patient hospital 1 month, that's delaying hospitals income month. becomes cash flow issue
2. Long hospital stay expensive. result, I'd expect hospitals losses patients can't afford pay.
3. Elective procedures gone. generally profitable cover low costs procedures hospital mortality rate IFR, mortality rate percentage entire population dies flu. True, think Walmart enforcing policy either. supposedly went effect Monday 20th. Well went local WalMart maybe 50% shoppers masked. one said anything. 

They made nice noises put policy effect. enforce piss customers refuse wear masks. care you, liability. policy enough cover them. Looks like I'll crossing river shopping time being. Nah, Menards today. huge sign entrance one anywhere near door enforce employee walked ahead wearing mask. employee walked ahead using protect chin.

11% rebate everything though, guess save big money air filters. Fine business charge owner refusing wear mask. u live? live nyc know 6 people 2 died also thought they'd enough testing capacity contact tracing head outbreak.... save PPE medical staff.

Of fucking course knew masks slow spread. hoarding hospitals.

They dig hole national stockpile PPE sliver been.  knew too.

The CDC problem telling truth, messaging effect: keep PPE hospitals. Saying whatever sounds plausible get effect perhaps hallmark executive branch.

Then real trouble started fucked response badly, needed new messaging completely different effect.  tons better treatments reduce mortality 

1) learned focus fighting inflammation getting oxygen levels costs. Remember March would need bajillion ventilators, rarely hear them? That’s turned harm good. exacerbated inflammation lungs caused deaths saved.

For reason, anti-inflammatory drugs turned useful thought. Steroids statins shown help thought early on.


2) able zero antivirals actually help. HCQ much, remdesivir become standard Im sure virus widespread global, mutated hundreds times hundreds strains Cause might die. Person comes car mask hanging neck. puts pass door guard. takes door. back square one. door guard likely help, since visible security usually will, solve anything. problem still persist employees. Calling security guy escalate situation risk alienating paying customers, remains unwanted source trouble legal liability store. scary af Texas counted COVID deaths. reasons.

People look excess death data, unless gets obfuscated too, work reasonable percentage likely due COVID. think depends hugely state live in. average state 3 days, despite majorly stepped community testing, people symptoms without. small, democratic state though. Neither flu. It’s controlling it, though, right US refusing properly that.  British citizen? word....No going interesting accidentally make vaccine also works coronavirus colds. major concern, nobody enjoys cold. say half USA spiking COVID19 cases started 3-4 weeks ago? Girl Scouts gone virtual area. partnered university provide really awesome summer program. kid got big box supplies separated week/badge daily zoom calls work stuff.

They even virtual talk birds hosted zoo presenter shoved webcam next owls hawks stuff.

10/10, stuck home Girl Scouts awesome group involved with. I'm really hoping mask mandate change trajectory. noticed county went red, saw mask every person saw public. Hopefully people start common sense sympathy.

Btw thank service! guys real heroes right now, deserve praise world. curiosity, many people think US support FAUCI? Even did, think damage already done, people set way.
I'm NC, see wearing masks, still others wear nose chin. 
I went IHOP today. Manager chin, waiter nose.
Another establishment went staff wearing masks properly, food prep (I could see swinging doors)
This got 100% going work. Speak yourself. Things started looking up! true right around New York's cases peaking everyone still dead scramble tests. Since then? testing goes up, % positivity keeps going too. infections outpacing increase testing supply. thinking would great county school boards could read it, talking Florida.  conversation friend yesterday. I’m firm believer wearing masks since America less 100 cases. However wearing mask without doubt makes harder breathe. damn near impossible usual workout without feeling like I’m going pass extremely stressed breathing: said I’m saying information factual, I’m still 100 percent wearing mask anytime I’m around people. Today 16.3% (9879/60574) new cases.

[numbers It’s even phylum mate thought charge cyber? ever online? still fighting one /r/Alberta pretty regularly. Yup. can't count vaccine able protect us, think might need masks protect us. already mutated deadlier form least already used one June thought thats disconnect is. 

I pointed takes years bring vaccine market. hit fact according one best shops business takes years develop safe effective vaccine. produce package go testing required vaccine. 

You claimed making false statements. linked outside sources backing numbers. going half cocked saying even quoting you. simple minimum amount time takes develop safe effective vaccine. oxford vaccine ever comes market offered US put time effort seeing exact time took phase testing. many ""newest magic bullet cures"" posts seeing sub fluff. ‘Wax poetically’ Florida’s future Still mask mandate necessary, change mind? Residual side-effects much 6x common.

do evidence this? Anyone else feeling really tired lately? tend sleep 8+ hours day still feel like crap throughout day. correct refer 'germ', virus. eating chips virus going infect you. It’s bullshit tbh. relieved said closed health department says “If serve food stay open” lol. It’s like bars deemed unsafe told close, somehow serving burger next door somehow cancels everything that’s unsafe bars allows stay open. It’s nuts. I’ve spoken local supervisor health department said they’re allowed inspections time reports violations going unheard. OSHA.  least now, Trump care. Ron DeSantis done things since March would make Satan blush. piece garbage guy is.   Indiana resident well. confirm Facebook lit red-faced, neck veined screamers, shouting ""mah rights"", also happen old ""friends"" high school. That's Facebook ya though. Seems populate days.

Aka damn near risk factors Except mother. actually started smoking stressed idiot. shade deaths consistently lag behind cases. addition masks, need much higher percentage population willing wear them, willing part protect themselves, protect neighbors, protect America. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* They’re concerned behind camera. They’re stores, classrooms, hospitals. They’re safe behind podiums offices won’t deal ramifications choices. people die say “well, pre-existing conditions. fault 🤷🏼‍♀️”
Mean hospitals weren’t overwhelmed depleted resources, people would follow incredibly simple health safety precautions, numbers would down, hospitals could handle it, wouldn’t many people dying. stick-your-head-in-the-sand, anti-masker, open schools, t***p supporters love say countries opening too, fail acknowledge countries ready followed mask mandates social distance protocols put place. 
Our leadership joke. 100% agree, wait see blow faces. Happy cake day, crazy bastard. I'd venture guess got right. guess let see filter day there...

OK yep. open TX page hover right numbers going go up. There's global shortage supplies PCR testing that's impacting hospital, caused [the three big hospital systems Albuquerque, NM stop testing asymptomatic would expect testing growth slow level positivite % continues rise next weeks. Well, interest EVERY company pandemic over. Oh yeah, sure. didn’t mean diminish point viagra. husband works Pfizer tie little viagra pills wears work sometimes shits giggles. Yeah, I've seen lot law enforcement said enforce law. sure case. like Iraq's WMD. US's claim must correct. go *that* far avoid ever question believe believe it. Man that's bad. party. People things desperately clinging knew. lot sad stories people accept reality different now. honest, read headline read India, realize untill comment America. Evidence? reminder meeting Mitch Mcconnell attended tan suit discuss passing legislation protect employers liability staff contract covid work. suspect wore suit would distract content meeting.

Edit: press conference Obama wore tan suit economic recovery 2008 financial collapse, Russian interference Ukraine, speaking congress decided need congressional approval engage military action Syria. Fox news Republican congress people latched onto suit, people busy discussing missed points presiential authority authorizing military action without congressional approval, early announcement evidence Russian meddling foreign politics. correct, today 16% idiots still comparing flu hearing stories like beyond me. trick, thanks. spreadsheet, everything open. still think numbers biased. 

Reference: family. think could 

1) many protesters wore masks

2) outdoors

3) spikes occuring numbers protests would materialized

4) even protesters got sick still relatively small percentage population guy said ""we never shake hands again""

Doctors saying decades, long Covid19. lot people cultures handshaking thing find disgusting primitive, even. one biggest way diseases passed.

It could worse: America could kiss-to-greet culture. Losing bigger change.  that's true, beaches locked down, along parks, outdoor concerts sporting events, construction work, summer camps, outdoor dining, etc., etc. - million people congregating streets fine, people arrested beach alone? unsafe kids 2 wear mask. Source: daughter 2 wife researched crap topic fuckin time. tried mandate masks April pulled back immediately **the next day** red cronies bitched moaned. really impressed Dewine's response covid that. great job Ohio beginning since failed. Clearly afraid trumpets. Really wish could count right thing; unfortunately, he's another Republican fuckass. they're saying people obese. Man internals must apocalyptic actually says there’s issue Get wrecked law enforcement exists, least ""authoritarian"" countries.

But free societies can't really that, governments free societies can't tell do, kidnap secret police deploy paramilitary shoot street, know, nothing draconian enforcing lockdown. People lie dumbest shit worst case scenario (assuming peak new cases) detection rate blown level first peak would triple this. \~5400 deaths day.

&amp;#x200B;

I enough optimism pessimism believe either occur. serve maximum minimum. Yes, remember that. made clear time relying Hoosiers take care wearing masks, clear want mandate mask wearing.   


As state, may example correlation implying causation, can't help wonder factor decision. need tho (New England NY), locking right would futile counterproductive. You’d negatives lockdown none positives. Even every last coronavirus Massachusetts eliminated, within day, traveler state would bring virus. Lion's Camp? usually aren’t enough doses every young healthy person get flu shot. people really feel guilty employers make sick employees come work. It’s going tough live rest life

Or, devil’s advocate, might mien never cared others deeply anyways, even family; death grandmother might never trouble day life develop vaccine (Oxford England). Moderna entered stage 3 trials, testing thousands Atlanta. “Who find pens five minutes” item social work meeting. think winner 38.

For things like scavenger hunts part virtual social hour week people wish. It’s good thing - run someone outside work reporting structure absolutely pressure participate. really helps extroverted staff deal things. Lol, “Good News” flair indeed Downvoted factual. think correct mix, part. 

Another point, hate raise, look South (Especially though exclusively), whole lot rural areas spent better part 30 years closing hospitals. I’m certain aren’t larger number folks quietly dying home. life Fans blow. Lmao hang hat single source misquoted. I’m guessing I’m arguing teenager right don’t time that. encourage skepticism informed decisions. highly suggest take route future. Adults generally recognize issue breathing, unlike infant.

Texas big state, may depend live. I'm DFW people I've known tested gotten results 3-5 days, unless paid get instant results test.  Runcie sucks fucking hard. work ESE kids wants report PERSON, THREE DAYS WEEK schools. kids worked compromised immune systems. They're way susceptible catching COVID normal kid. God forbid get pass onto someone else. KEEP 100% VIRTUAL!!!! Wrong. China forbid oversea Chinese citizen coming back. cannot come back flight. Maybe shouldn’t fuckin open stupid people keep nose mask downvote this. Here's paper I've bookmarked since People keep getting infected figure out. like original morons thought Even quicky, wrap sticky wear mask, too. Poor guy. idiocy even seriously respond stuff like he’s actually almost anyone eradicate disease. Infections nursing homes soaring NY policy major issue. would panic? It’s sniffles flu worst. They’ll fine. That's fair time estimates shop. Like 18 24 months. still 4x faster we've ever done before. I'm exhausted news able believe anything read I've pulled paper. We're mentally fried. Legally, hold supreme court. truly new dark age. ""conspiracies"" peddled millions nowadays west absolutely surreal. can't believe happening 21st century. Yea sadly always market Hit body like ""lightning strike."" month sick still sick, ""way way worse flu."" long ordeal filled kinds crooked paths. peaked weeks shutting mean it. balls. Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida.

Not sure Arkansas South Carolina. Gawd. Men fucking dumb rocks.  manage construction projects get front row seat. wear mask eat could, arnt havmt amd stands lack logistical support mass vaccination let alone legal battles coming Neanderthals. conspiritards brigading thread?

Really? thought Texas still pretty long turnaround rate testing. shorter, that's great.  fact Manitoba well suddenly stopped proactive wants charge re-opening makes blood boil.

After Phase 3 reopening, got fired asking accommodations high-risk caretaker high-risk individual I'm extremely limited jobs apply to. would make world difference mandated masks. heart breaking Woman fb page posted long list bullshit reasons wear one, stupid reasons. Russia, probably way win make liberals cry (as suggested bumper sticker). even endgame aside seeing side suffer. really think it’s important try separate real world media social media wants us think (including Reddit disinformation campaign).

65% voters trust fauci 26% say don’t. That’s percent country, it’s percent voters.

The distrust fauci campaign short lived idiotic political strategy. never widespread belief.

Trump runs campaign division. blanketly assign views entire political party playing trap. We’re lot alike elite wants us believe. Echo chambers dangerous sides, takes effort fight People kept saying “as percentage it’s still lower X country.” I’ve seen slowly watching US climb percentage table.

At rate they’ll 9/11 every day still shows signs stopping using preventative measures. isn’t selfish thing like people think: haven’t met teacher doesn’t think distance learning sucks (it educated less effectively harder many ways) it’s still preferable getting spreading covid broken records death disco. fine. doctor’s offices taking every precaution world. it’s dangerous put necessary medicinal procedure. tyrannical government would make non compliance crime is...... Correct 😔 Oh, know, he's lying he's playing 4736272D chess sending coded messages! got decoder ring everything! I'm still saying thing: age deaths? 80+ death causes conflated/complicated problems like obesity. Also mortality rate still well 1%, even facts included. I'm saying real, can't deny far overblown. Canada closer, handle weather. 

Once border opens again. ratios vary based are. southern states, feels like barely anyone wearing masks. emphasized places. I've unfortunately witness stupidity myself. I'm planning boat escape Cuba, let know onboard

Pun intended 33,654 people died 2018 due auto accidents US

Over 145,000 people died corona past 167 days (since first reported coronavirus death February 6th.). Per CCTV Weibo, Dalian Pandemic Prevention press conference: yesterday Liaoning one domestic confirmed case, worker food import processing plant. investigating close contacts case 2 confirmed cases 12 asymptomatic carriers discovered, work processing plant.

All three confirmed cases left Dalian previous 14 days. contact history confirmed cases people high risk areas recent people entered border.

Staff two relevant companies involved isolated asymptomatic carriers discovered among staff via PCR test. virus gets worse flu season fucked. Man I'm working military environment moment many times I've heard believing numbers car crash written covid argument hate shit. Like really think falsely inflating numbers helps people? don’t get goal thinking conspiracy after. Businesses failing, unemployment time high. economy barely struggling along.  

What rub making covid bigger deal is? shadowy puppet masters benefitting that? makes sense downplay severity get people back spending money working. 4r real wao okay know that. come Google it? trying make point? thank god made America great again, right? Idk, number compare causes death US? Stay well! week it’s ‘death part life’

Or they'll go back ""most people dying elderly compromised immune systems would died without virus"" What? Mexico, Brazil Bolivia +60% positive rate ... according Peruvian health ministry, positive rate yesterday 18% (they 18-20% weeks never reached 30%), Johns Hopkins data come from?

Source: Literally way ever changed everyone went general strike nobody willing even they're risk dying. keep hearing people say “....... economy!!” regards shutting down. 

How economy fair hundreds thousands US’ work force dead, dying, hospital home fighting pandemic. Eventually numbers catch impact daily operations businesses. guy trust guy lies fucking constantly then, probably disproportionately, killing older poc. 

Minorities usually get short stick anything bad. Yeah. someone severe anxiety, literally half sub textbook reassurance seeking. feeds anxiety becomes cycle. Comments worried passing someone street detailed symptom lists (that usually consist everyday bodily quirks) probably get deleted tbh.

I’d willing bet regulars pretty anxious general. kind reading pandemic day long. haven’t 1000 since early June. Cases deaths decline we’re spiking again. Yes simply believe deadly virus. think it’s media hype friends mine like “you can’t live fear. going hanging friends kills it” WTF????? Meanwhile Florida: ‘Huh what’s that?’ USA! USA! USA!

Don't forget Trump said interview day, Fox, national TV, *the US lowest mortality rate planet due Covid*

The scary part is, think might actually believe Um, racist know Harris County exactly? Houston Harris County. area leads state infections, Rio Grande Valley.   many us loaded guns ammo Jan Feb. Winter coming.  wonder goes down. people refuse gate wait flight? air marshals flights like back 9/11 days? flight attends ask, refuse - happens? Wrong Easter, tho. affect men? Personally, trying get trying pass others. get deal it. live knew people lived 1918? parents getting infected spreading asymptomatically next 2 weeks jobs, increasing rate infection classroom size. Maybe 10k deaths day Christmas keep last 3 month trajectory next three months. Halloween Christmas gonna suck. Idk might point. Yakima lockdown beginning month even reopened marginally. fair, it’s also largely open whole time since 65% workforce essential think we're managing well Canada neighbors batshit insane approach far. done good job think. shut work, over, numbers depend people conduct themselves... leave hopeful. 

We serious chunk population behave totally irresponsibly recklessly. see cause outbreaks place. bunch dead kids roads open well, numbers matter talking shutting society. mortality rate everyone mortality rate kids one would give fuck virus. America disgusts think seeing percentage make much sense. Mass murders make even less blip really go like well that's 3000 people that's ok. don’t need perfect knowledge build projection. Damn right beratna! real tho, wish case, I’m lowly tech BS bio. city sueing? No. Half idiots take vaccine.
 everyone pretended like already infected self quarantined would 2 weeks. We're stupid that. know cold life? March postulated Facebook numbers showed least 250k deaths Thanksgiving. shot hard. 

Yeah. Wish wrong. Looks like easy target. people keep using statistics beginning spike say ‘oh it’s bad’? beginning hit next spike exponential spread. numbers you’re quoting child’s play week’s time. pneumonia yeah. keep hearing joke youtube reddit. overused Big tough? That's caveman speech. Teachers Florida could go strike. believe state replace thousands teachers staff schools Florida. parents decide send kids school. numbers large enough, nothing state anyway.  feds can't go city start kidnapping people cities? Good. hope anti-maskers go way dinosaur says 720 factorial. 720 factorial (or 720!) incredibly large number, even many viruses affect mammals world. estimated 320,000 viruses actually affect mammals ( ). Even going far count every single virus planet, estimated 10^(31) viruses planet ( ). 
So yeah, article actually say 720 factorial, extremely long number accurate 720 factorial. That's interesting. I'll bet daily deaths come 1,800 ""best case"" 7D rolling average simply based fact 2.7% correct given IFR likely around 0.7% CFR continue fall towards completed tests.  Yeah, endocrine differences little bodies process vaccine. clickbait. wear fucking mask 1000 deaths day half cancer RISING. Cancer deaths rising rate. women 3/4 men U.S. low IQs choose obese ruin immune systems.

This screams someone who’s totally ignorant understanding addiction, IQ, statistics. would bet you’re also part crowd arguing schools opened pedestrians said so, doctors wrong treat trans people, scientists don’t know Jack global warming. remember ""the flu deadlier"" swimming pools? dont dare delete if!!!! Say sic  yeah, I'm American definitely friends dude. That's fucking weird Going party condo 8 people probably 100 times risk getting pizza someone without mask. Getting pizza, breathed 1 person's exhaled air 10 seconds. party breathed 8 people's exhaled air multiple hours. know going patio means -- mean like crowded outdoor bar? sounds pretty similar condo party, maybe even worse number different people. masks places? turn infected (I hope!) really reconsider putting others' lives risk living like pandemic. Even seasonal flu knock ass week more, 6 times deadlier flu. No. Google deaths per day trends. 1000 pretty regularly while. around 2-3k bit  That’s I’m saying. There’s fiscal precedent wanting fund preventative treatments reduce costs. Kinda interesting puts odds big pharma. encountered woman Facebook refused wear masks cause bad breath? guess she'd rather spread disease maybe carry listerine spray mints purse. Catastrophic failure , tragedy #neverforget work hospital, coworker said weeks ago. got curious actual payments worked covid. Essentially there's fixed amount swabbing someone, fixed amount running test depending type test doing, 20% charge care admitted covid patients. given amount money spent creating whole icu wings scratch, money spent new analyzers run tests super expensive PPE that's hardly good profit margin. importantly, since hospital never charges someone dying charge. 

I explained coworker went nuts screaming I'm liar would make up. said got right cares act, said ""what liberal bullshit site find lies"", responded ""Whitehouse.gov full text bill open right here"" ""oh going believe government! fucking sheep!"" woman says Trump greatest gift America history. 

It's rare get angry, holy fuck want gouge eyes out. giddy ignorance morons much. think like youngest school children slightly higher risk. Still zero risk age group. think real tragedy children best hygiene they're going bringing back home them. Parents grandparents children also going catch it. 

The curve going spike families school age children. Looks like people good 4th July. he’s trying cover ass Well, keep mind changes age groups, 4% averaged among them. People 19 (I think least) 1.4% death rate. adults, (aged 30-60), death rate around 6%. goes even higher older person gets. 

Not mention, pre-existing condition asthma, multiplies chance death 12x..

Let's hope people real young, least :/ wish spent much general welfare.

Our wealth inequality fucked.  Pneumonia variety issues caused people afraid go hospital. never get good answer pneumonia counts though ask nonbelievers. It’s got strange big uptick pneumonia deaths nothing pandemic causes pneumonia. even care child noone else kids dying infected hospitals overwhelmed might able treat every kid. Even 0.001% chance kid would die millions kids infected will. school district decided go full distant learning year. Ontario. Far less cases. lock months. stage 2 opening back stage 3 coming soon. I’m terrified. we’ve done pretty well. 

I can’t imagine living state people like “who fuck cares”. 

It’s times like realize poorly US education mental health systems failed populace. That's great. wife Dane problem CA. favorite part one realised kids come home infect working parents go back make mcdoubles mask hanging ear, maybe finally get cheaper housing. 

It's 2024 bill burr joke: ""the best thing COVID killing millions Americans Christmas people pay attention math class, hover traffic better, housing prices went down. Thank this. I’ve mostly quit reading sub b/c there’s LOT doom gloom that’s based half-understood facts. Don’t get wrong- there’s plenty reason concern it’s totally possible things might stay bad good while, there’s much don’t know right now. Awareness concern, sure. Unwarranted fear? thanks. hard find data it, lot data I've seen showing web searches right masters want know shit. Best I've able find past 5 minutes searching article data UK earlier year  Smallpox eradicated 1980. IIRC polio eradicated well. Yea Ive following literature obsessively, didn’t mean come “covid isn’t dangerous” be, time simply isn’t bad. It’s little % people get left completely devastated. Definitely horrible horrible disease silently kills slowly time it’s rough cold bad flu make want die anywhere little sniffles symptoms all. 

The immediate threat lies within hospital systems capacity treat large numbers patients mostly vulnerable population brings table. worry everyone, deaths end November 4th, 2020. Sigh. deniers know this, too.

But keep *saying* children fine, next child cases they'll say ""see, told you, issues"" never ever ever admitting there's connection new spike deadly cases among parents, grandparents, teachers, administrators, groundskeepers, bus drivers, babysitters...

Focusing health children deliberate straw man approach. wrong, point even younger people start taking seriously? plenty news stories young people needing hospitalizations, ventilators, even dying. Lots possibilities:

1. poll numbers. [Something's They’re saying death rate next zero it’s like whatttttt Say got early March shut ""squash it."" week got it, I'm asymptomatic able spread give brother. never show symptoms again. week brother gets he's asymptomatic spread gives father.  Another 7 days pass, father pre-symptomatic world opens planned.

And think ""we squashed thing"" internet pathologist macrocanthorhynchus says so, then... Exponential growth occurs, today, benefit authoritarian shutdown put place except extra 3 week buffer.

That thing. way out; need somebody blame blame people blaming problems on, change virus acts. It. Is. Inevitable. we're gonna keep everything open anyway?  Incoming Americans “but it’s 900k” would raise counts cases get paid dead bodies.

The Morgue Cemeteries get paid dead bodies. shitty comment. think devil would ever say something horrible didn’t think California would surpass New York total overall cases, are... Yeah there's sense trying get anyone realize here, reddit, recess refers congressional recess. I.e. congress session. Meaning, there's votes taking place thus reason congress stay Washington. 

The idea members congress spend every day recess feet desk smoking cigars laughing awful poor people is, assume, vision redditors recess.

If members worked around clock Washington votes took place every day, they'd completely touch needs actual Americans even now. Thanks freaking asking. data % COVID cases deaths Republicans vs Democrats? know like think dumbies poor old fat smokers eat McDonald's, that's fantasy. Truth is, plenty young, successful, thin, beautiful, healthy people dumb shit well sneaking suspicion O2 sat remain steady....until really restrict flow, body attempt compensate well then. words, wonder real effect, well within body's natural ability adjust. similar scenarios might going airplane (reduced pressure), working out. would Democratic voters die? would Reps benefit? Good call. Dark, good.  Yep Life Insurance companies, think get decide.

(Pandemic exemptions fairly common void payout) sister every fucking time. much winning😪 like dang, can't least loose once? Alabama April/May kept telling conservative coworkers would probably need new lockdown July/August shit job first one. one paid attention yet are. Mid late July Alabama really probably another lockdown. wont Meemaw Ivey Trump lackey should. Right. don’t get money deaths. get reimbursed treating highly infectious patients require specialized care. patient dying impact money receive. invade Iran fight Covid? Lock n load! /s  great stole nation resources people fight back.  always assumed cult personality needed someone personality, boy wrong. Oh god, covid changes anything long run, change that? I'm sick able hear people music not, Merkel basically present first stages pandemic. definitely leader. international people seriously overestimate importance education German perception. early stages health minister talking German people importantly state leaders. crisis managers. 

If asked Germans field study less people would know people reddit.
The number one eductor Germany guy named Christian Drosten leading viroligst Berlins charite. second popular podcast talked Germany pandemic.. bartender long time Coronavirus hit pandemic made unpleasant visceral reaction seeing people bars now. don’t plan ever working one every again, despite cocktails passion, never career again.

It’s selfish. tide goes really see beneath water along. course. Capitalism wants coverup let rip. Die rich system. Except Pfizer one mRNA vaccine you’re switching making apple pie egg sandwich Appreciated! gonna slow time soon. folks apparently never passed biology class ruined everything. Correct  I’m assuming don’t need speed limit 45 highways, right? would ridiculous. would take four days drive across state Texas speed. 

There used nationwide speed limit 55 mph highway, disaster. Everyone disregarded actually lead fuel expenditure cars less efficient speed.

Reducing speed limits won’t help. better public transportation. I'm 3k new deaths everyday make ""9/11 every day"" song.

We're way there, folks. I've got cops family. hearing ""Black Lives Matter TERRORIST GROUP"" talking points five years ago, Fox News pushing fact.

This coming blue. mainstream beliefs among conservatives.  Boss probably want dealing shit either snapped. country reduced coronavirus counts counting dead recovered? average adult gets 2-3 colds year. Children twice that. Even 20%(15% I've read), odds high many colds caused coronaviruses life. anxiety leaving house. Missed work today it. shit sucks dude. ""Our human capital stock ready get back work."" Lol glad could keep respectful adult conversation. think lot boils able see long term effects future. 
""If virus here, sick people NOW?"". 
""If there's many cases, deaths NOW?"". 
  
And kinda falls line many talking points (you know group I'm talking about). 
 
""I know happen future, want tax cuts NOW!"". 
""I care greatly benefit everyone future, social programs cost money NOW!"". 
""I care health population months time, people need work NOW!"". 
""I care global average temperature future, there's global warming NOW!"". 
""I care cause adverse effects future, company I'm CEO needs rid regulations NOW!"". 
 
Trying general possible, there's lot examples one side tends run policies focusing *now*, disregarding future. never said people weren’t dying COVID alone, let’s pretend numbers aren’t inflated. I’ve heard version multiple times now. It’s doctors suddenly became lazy put covid19 cause death everyone dies hospital mean, competition. think anyone disagrees US response ridiculously awful unacceptable, NZ done really well.

It's like *over*, though. NZ can't remain sealed-off island forever. They'll start opening travel again, cases again, even they're governmentally constitutionally incapable fucking US levels. doubt anyone could. Jokes you. don’t friends family literally can’t kill anyone know. Can't mobile networks still track SIMs ping towers &amp; signals? US population: 328.2 million. 

May odds ever favor. heard companies going remote first week March Bay Area, pissed department’s VP refused work remotely CEO nailed started WFH 16th. VP would’ve wanted us come office till forced gov’t. live island Maine come weekends every house crammed people partying state. one gets called anything. Didn’t UK hit like 1500 deaths day? US many confirmed cases less deaths UK Thank - means much hear would help could. feels bit hopeless right now...Your comment lifted spirits little. likely somethng 10,000 people dying every day country 330,000,000, 90% 80. : / Funny thing is, Vietnam 0 deaths. Despite first case January, Italy warned world. Months old news. know. Yeah. sub mostly clickbait news articles one takes time read beyond title. digress. I’m pro mask pro social distancing don’t understand getting downvoted.

Everyone wants corona stop get back stuffing faces drowning livers public. Americans don’t take care themselves. heard things going get worse get better RemindMe! August 30 physical activity work? Maybe going walks runs bike ride would help. know counterintuitive energy active sit around nothing work usually video ""horses mouth"" makes clear talking people pre-existing conditions die covid, deaths absolutely kind asserted first post. someone covid jumps airplane dies impact counting covid death. can't snip last sentence persons statement ignore context leading expect people miss that. greatest condition try lift ~3x/week

Little cardio lol

No prior experience w masks

Just pimples chin flaky/oily skin around nose (I’ve always great skin though)

I don’t think depth rate changed much. hour 4 I’m breathing bit faster it’s gotten sweaty moist lol

Haven’t tried cardio w masks!! lack humanity shocks me. know noticed got secret federal police disappearing nonviolent protesters major American cities. time give guns.  Agree. Although pity made wanted make right choices people chose dying anyway. Lots there. Dude, movies available countries, well. Thank you, I’m Maine shits normal. Also tons tourists wearing masks it’s super safe leave house honestly. What's wrong yellow ones? popsicle racism??? 
/s that's optimistic hope.... sadly wrong grew guns. got first rifle 9th birthday (I live south). love smell gunpowder. Love shooting stuff. love mechanics guns, history. comes hunting, actually prefer bow (a little challenging interesting). Use gun running low meat (not great bow even though enjoy more.)

Safety? Protection? lot empirical evidence suggest gun good choice. keep crowbar seat truck self defence. also suggest bear spray. Strictly speaking, legal use humans, doubt cops would raise eyebrow used repel home invaders.

I'm probably typical gun owner, though. I'm completely open broader discussions school shootings such. Although enjoy convenience guns shoot lots bullets target practice, acknowledge actual needs met gun fires one bullet.  would frankly amazed world could entirely eradicate this. Seems unlikely. I’ve like twenty replies people defending notion lol. It’s crazy. don’t know got from. Trump handling crisis well expected to.

Next up: Millions people becoming homeless. I’m sure go smoothly. /s reason assume baristas infected rate 50%. person sneezed something high risk may worth considering, playing numbers game relatively harmless encounter person statistically speaking extremely unlikely COVID beneficial. healthy microanalyze every possible encounter outside. reinforces deepens anxiety instead managing realistically. whole sub daily discussions RemindMe! 30 days good news flu hitting Southern Hemisphere hard social distancing. lockdown never ended us. 

To honest, rough lockdown really sympathize people want open everything again. days becoming weeks weeks becoming months, spend day day inside house increasingly feeling like cage. really tough. miss life precoronavirus.  Lucky number studies showing spread minimal. Tells people ""I work medical field"" Covid making V, it’s making check mark keeps going going going... friend mine works rural hospital full lockdown hold non-emergency care, lost large amount aid funding coronavirus patients. *is* general financial incentive, surprising fudging. mid-size corporation devotes considerable effort keeping managers faking reports personal gain, I'd pleasantly surprised find Emergency Funding Bill Pass Right kind robust oversight provisions.  Good luck getting bunker boy anything sensible individual people county, vote people currently charge. everyone post forgetting this, treating everyone county like single evil entity? They're fellow citizens. bit heart? Thems communisty words, young man! Yeah, course that’s would say.. I’m onto billy boy severe lack originality? seen things show improved care actually helps bit hospital crowding, early people hospital month many patients, meant piled faster, patients 1-2 weeks makes bit managable, still capacity like flood gates before. I'm date conspiracies sometimes feel like Fauci says things sole purpose creating fear uncertainty. Perhaps headlines make seem way though. Same. quit vaping March 30, also happened birthday. eating better, exercising, losing weight ever since. NFL going allow fans? Northeast Ohio too. Every time go out, I'm also trying limit high risk family members, I'm amazed number people wearing mask wearing correctly. many people wearing nose! absolutely never happen. Cuomo ask it. fact Trump seen wearing one recommends beyond wildest dreams right now. 

It's weird though notion Trump wearing recommending mask seems largely ignored vocal followers. reopening school US news, think ""do able"". 

Under conditions.
1. Everyone mask up, clothes mask do. Assuming everyone including infected lessen asymptomatic spreading.

2. school report one case ,the school must close least 14 days. identify asymptomatic everyone related school reported case must get tested.

3. Wash hands, sanitizer often. 

I think enough hold vaccines process.

I speaking Thailand.

If restaurant, school, bank etc. report case, must implement Covid-19 cycle breaker. Mostly close 14 days.

For hospital, sometimes whole ward closed. Mainly medical staffs suspected contact Covid-19 sent 14 days quarantine.

It quite effective.  Kill victims murder offset corona virus  astroturfer spouts misinformation already monster worth hell since getting inocents killd paycheck, double down, spout propagand proven wrong months ago, easy verify compare meaning even kid fall you, show unable think statistic work since think 3% must mean 3 referring percentages millions billions.... really shows literacy isnt needed job spreading propaganda online huh includes shuttering vast majority deemed ""essential"" sectors.

Does include comedy clubs? point view water C-19 kill old people. think use “freedom assembly” idiosyncratic. 

As far religious gatherings go, saying states legally required special accommodations indoor religious gatherings? long law gatherings neutral regards religion, problem? make stricter rules religion compared similar secular activities, would take issue that.

Didn’t Scalia write decision saying religious people still follow laws weren’t enacted intent discriminate? It’s little bit both. Lol world people get put charge anything? East Asia SEA cultures actually give damn common public good. Mask usage extremely high part world.

Lol primitive, American right talk especially vast swathes country look like developing world shitholes. Native Reservations states like West Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi quite number more.  timeframes changing leadership moving align things governments people agree with. Think person needs cancer treatment wait try next time install new guy favor medicaid expansion?

where outrage residents county defied public health guidelines? told ""don't violate guidelines get funding"" violated guidelines make shocked pikachu face try call political vengeance ""the thing explicitly warned would consequence intentionally spreading disease""? resignation letter written up. I'm currently go 2 days per week, got told need 3 phasing people next 2 weeks. end phase I'd working 5 days office 38 people open cubicle. live area rapidly rise governor actually considering scaling us back phases bad here. I'm willing die job. 100% job home. silly fabric ones people wearing? Medical grade mask don’t feel bad tried others do.  Yaaaay lived long life! fact let fist aquatic animals.... Bunch prudes even read posted? don’t believe it’s plausible theory could changed scientific data. Scientists still don’t know animal origin virus. 

“Although evidence shows SARS-CoV-2 purposefully manipulated virus, currently impossible prove disprove theories origin described here. However, since observed notable SARS-CoV-2 features, including optimized RBD polybasic cleavage site, related coronaviruses nature, believe type laboratory-based scenario plausible.

More scientific data could swing balance evidence favor one hypothesis another. Obtaining related viral sequences animal sources would definitive way revealing viral origins.” Larry Brilliant mentioned monoclonal antibodies treatments promising treatment COVID. it? What's timeline? saying attempting search articles yet come anything? Yeah, shit sugar tits guarantee shock worn aftermath post coronavirus thousands lawsuits politicians. Thank Trump destroying generations massive neuro-invasive, blood-brain barrier crossing, filopodia inducing nightmare, making COVID endemic population.

The amount blood Trump's hands hard calculate, hard imagine anyone else responsible US deaths. Feel free provide source that's scientifically backed data. ""People reporting!"" nothing gossip. Unfortunately, key word ""temporary"". No, want specific complex near 18th ella/TC Jester. best! Yea generation hooked vaping since 16. knows happen. damn Disney movies kid raised expectations...I blame them. GOOD CATCH. someone moved back NY two years [failing find live broadcast editing work GA syndicated circa 2017-2018, personally vouch systemic hellscape news pipeline. approved article even hinting addressing corporate / health disaster is, things going really, REALLY rails. Washington Township straight said it’s online indefinitely (unless changed it). Since virus contagious symptoms show deadly strain would problem spreading. happens virus slows infected person much spread it.  Fans drunk game. see disinfectant knocks minute. One minute. way something like that, injection inside almost cleaning?

Still don’t see anything telling Citizens inject disinfectant. really seems like life COVID nothing unending pain misery. It’ll application costs lot states locked 2 months yeah, biggest change hospitalizations closer flu lengths biggest problem, people covid hospitalized month often. 🤣WHAT?! live nice suburb San Diego bought 3 bedroom condo 335K 2 years ago. 3 bed, 2 bath, fireplace, washer/dryer, single car garage, 1 parking spot, pool, solar, playgrounds, automatic gates, etc. Even city San Diego get studio way less 2k. sure live wouldn’t make blanket statement especially don’t know. mean, sounds silly, good working come safer way still function times. goddamn fuck real!

Good job, good luck, fellow March quitter! LIBERATE! 2nd Amendment! Something freedom!  Guess is. according downvotes, I'm one. mean sarcasm add ""/s"" sentence. see. personally think knowing treat help beds hit capacity way places before. may wrong though. truth fact sick likely died earlier (which also skews excess mortality results). di hope youre right, see necessary? looked Lebanon's numbers? they? cause outbreak? I’m worried someone going snap friend, relative, dies COVID-19. hope not... experience tells someone might. That’s end civilization know it. us system broken. great civilizations fall. Time build better one, not. USA! USA!


I feel good Dr. Fauci (๑•﹏•) Protests &amp; riots aftermath I’m guessing I’ve idea awhile now. It’s likely even develop vaccine corona virus forever rage US nations across world. It’s new common cold/flu, itll rise winter diseases it’ll always threat workplaces public areas. 

I’ve often joked it’s matter time there’s designer face masks sold companies like Gucci XD. Masks soon become another article clothing that’ll forever encouraged public areas work places, simply biosecurity reasons. I’m condemning wearing masks clear XD.

Also wrong say antivaxxers literally hunted tranquilizer guns filled vaccines becomes available? Surgical masks ""kn95"" fairly easy find US past couple months. cost before. Actually like 3x double. friends arguing ""slippery slope"" towards federal government mandates. Saying step away enforcing anything without due process. said STFU wear god damn mask. Brb 500 ice cold takes 4 weeks ago need go retweet That's nice. plenty proof innovative hope so! expectations. disappointment it’s animals reinfect humans. Smallpox human hosts could immunize contact trace erradication. virus infect animals can’t actually stop it. could eradicated humans spreading among bats/pigs/cats/etc reinfect anytime. madness. C-19 steal life average victim average victim left c-19?

The median age someone dying C-19 US least, 80. Actuary tables show average 80 year old ya 8-10 years left, C-19 likely kill someone less average life expectancy left. Ah shit, yeah that’s much worse. hope you’ve got somewhat control. wouldn’t wish IBS anyone, can’t even begin imagine Crohn’s.

You’re correct, however. People might actually take things seriously! U-S-A! U-S-A! experimental vaccine kills funeral free?Asking friend. *that's* Trump sending Stormtroopers San Fransisco LA; want fall dead two weeks. Same. People never cease disappoint me... paranoid all. Love comment Yeah WTF. Pennsylvania one important states Union Civil War. Besides providing ton raw materials supplies, provided soldiers Union army (over 360,000 men) state besides New York. Flying confederate flag Pennsylvania dumb ignorant, straight insulting know anything history Pennsylvania state. cannot believe forgot soybeans! completely agree this. least TRY say something good virus? What. A. Downer. Provide exact quote told hospitals paid Covid deaths. people killed Levine's idiotic policy putting COVID patients ill-equipped nursing homes would heartily disagree, werent dead. case sounds like employers need pay better wages pandemic order get people work safer conditions compensated properly time risk taken.

It’s solely employers really. fed instituted paycheck protection program like EU did, didn’t suffer mass layoffs. instead gave trillions corporations banks (and pittance small business loans). lot bailout money shoulda gone actual people (those unemployed working risking every day).

Benefits loans etc etc great necessary fed really needed spend money resources eradicating virus early on. didn’t, continue way longer shoulda. haven’t even mentioned millions may evicted moratoriums run out. correct answer. question shelter-in-place next month, Sep, Oct, whether larger crisis make one ""overcome events"". Ye, Cuomo think watch video...... adjusts mask part way damn near cover past glasses still stays chin. Quit defending stupidity. can't companies hire security? Like bouncer? One door one patrolling store? labs said this. reason hasn’t done saliva regulatory work required emergency fda approval.
It would benefit children greatly. remorse often take time think about? guy sounds like shit general write someone *immediately* show remorse. pass mandate people wear seatbelts expect gas station employees enforce it. FUCK would go gym middle covid anyone recommend test kit making sure N95 filtering properly? I'd like rule counterfeit 3M filter/cartridges. Thanks. government works several layers governance, there's really one reason make effective use short period time, reason Trump.

Idk, least NY hasn’t gone shit yet Serious question...here Arkansas statewide mandate. HOWEVER, county sheriffs come publically even posting social media dont believe governor power implement order circumstances enforce it. Arkansas thing states facing problem well? People literally shot stabbed asked wear mask. worked retail. I'm risking nut assault minimum wage. Let politicians pay someone give benefits that. plan. 7-1 2014 mean, ever dengue fever? Malaria?

They're eradicated, low levels mostly feature adventure stories.

The vaccine need. coming. fact multitude coming. 

The message right needs stay strong, wear masks, socially distance ourselves, protect vulnerable, reasonable endgame sight.

Oh, get vaccine. need prove reasonably safe need part too. That's true though. people care old vulnerable. Sure, think lowest like 2 months good thing. I'm means ""minimizer"", anything want data convince people masks work. actually that.

There’s also evidence may able pass fecal oral route.

It’s good thing trust slaughter yards don’t care health safety enough protect workers Covid make sure workers adequate bathroom breaks hygiene standards would scary. mention skiing/snowboarding higher elevation much dangerous itself. people survive 10,000+ feet wear cloth mask lockdowns lead mass unemployment? Sounds pretty unassailable me. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Platinum AF. “All proper protocols place vendor including masks, gloves, plastic shielding check out, dine-in service,”

That said, need quit nicotine get insurance break previously classified smoker. worked retail customer service 10 years. mentioning far people losing shut, ever saw kind thing happen time. constantly read stories watch videos things course think daily occurrence. 

While shutting may help little, thousands, including myself, laid due shutdowns never got unemployment due faulty systems. I'm back work savings anymore fall back get laid again. really think people ""laughing mocking"" new york pointing reasons virus particularly damaging there, leaders exacerbated problem. least, ""laughing mocking"" virus affects rest country can't afford put lives hold indefinitely.

i certainly mocking new yorkers attitude displaying though. seriously, get yourselves. many steps. assign doctor's office covid person's bathroom. way doctor make sure they're right. think mask compliance stem lot that. results echo? currently taking quercetin? Soon number won’t able taste anyway. much one. politicians want pass laws figure someone enforce low wage retail employees. experiment. case one person would prove anything. love studies done mask effectiveness, one young person saying LOOK IM effected nothing whether reduces oxygen levels all. work medical, wear masks even this. Sometimes masks uncomfortable, especially fit correctly. ""experiment"" pseudoscience looking convince selfish assholes refuse wear masks. Two doses per person. 278.2 million unvaccinated. Good luck! time pay son’s COVID19 medical expenses. 🤘  backpedal. Yes am, good day, brother. worries, keep going glory holes fine.  expect us intense tech home pay fast internet. Nope. handwrite data one email enter system since dont two screens. lappy six years old. I'm slow get it.

It’s amusing Trump threaten withhold aid states don’t open schools, made zero attempt governors open properly would blunted outbreak see now. 

He also empowered millions antimaskers saying wasn’t publicly making fun people wore them. Like fuck that? Australia much better tracking virus collating data never got ridiculously control here. Also got nursing homes less here. deaths reported properly People mine like ""I forgot"" forget something simple mask work even simpler job. exactly, places like NYC Lombary, Italy flat trend last two months despite reopening. makes question maybe reinfection happen, common enough we'd probably start notice either hot spots. submission removed because

I remember reading comment said event U.S. ignoring problem first. knee jerk reaction every country deny wouldnt bad country others started take things seriously started. problem US never took seriously even warnings rise deaths According Cory House... Maybe  agree he's getting everything right perspective. (also live Indiana) said, bar Republicans set REALLY low. looks super-duper reasonable compared say, DeSantis. tell people get excited vaccine. takes long time find one test it. virus mutation. It’s reasons don’t cold vaccine. Trump referee free assert that. would mean actually tried one time isn’t case. woman palm beach told numbers unfair neighborhood got lumped ""migrants"". Pfizer Moderna found tcell response vaccine, info Liaoning woundering come Urumqi suddenly finding cases, huge increase test completed testing risk people related outbreak. testing moved onto testing remaining population. masks wear one time. panic feeling breathing balance CO2 O2 iirc. people get use mask increase VO2 max lol. tl;dr: ""chocolate"" one them. again, agree Trump never told anyone inject disinfectant. two employees die. sued families, fellow coworkers. 

I'm sure they're trying harder. makes think they'll suddenly drop bullshit actually help sudden?

Hopefully January ya'll new president? 190 proof Everclear 95% alcohol, actually [too high concentration effective dilute 10:1 water bring effective range. Trump huge problem, doesn’t listen anybody chance gets passes buck. 

Look covid pushed governor’s didn’t take blame. Even though tweeted poorly Obama handles outbreak 2009. said presidents responsibility handle it. 

He turned party joke, guys stand nothing point. 

He unleashed federal agents Portland 

He kind weird connection Russia

Yes said definitely problem 

But. 

Trump huge fucking problem Disease Tree family disease. bunch idiots. could even sell masks. Morons. That’s cause pence thought deserved it.  Currently CDC reporting 192,000 deaths average expected date.  gloom not, speculation, common cold, another coronavirus yet eradicated around long human records



You realize ""common cold"" exactly common actually hundreds different viruses... doubt gain? Ugh! safe little sis came say this. Leave laptop office - Install team viewer 2FA - Oh look that, ""working office"" Well sure, we’ll keep getting decreasing infection vectors. end matter scenario nay sayers come with. lie people call it. Easy. Iceland found 40+ strains way back March, yeah, probably hundreds now. Oof Wait, become best friends? Nothern Italy disciplined fuck right March? Flu unique rapidly mutates think unemployed - partly votes - mostly big corp places people go spend money wholesalers. rarer/slower happen speculated here. Smallpox europeans ages still deadly enough wipe half native american people came contact it. already spent money factories mfgr vaccine. money gone two months ago.  I'll quote true moving forward want be. Meanwhile Georgia 😑 That’s think happening lot folks. wear mask, gaiter mask well working. first started really felt like couldn’t breathe, it’s mind matter thing. got used went away. People push past it. 14 hours day 2 jobs you! Legalize slapping people without mask we'll virus wrapped like 2 weeks.  contribute way much society that. It’d irresponsible.


I would love rid burden though. LETS OPEN SCHOOLS, FLU, CANT FORCE WEAR MASK, MUH RITES! put kids. End story. Even approaching herd immunity without reaching threshold significantly slow rate spread make manageable. read one study says patients experience CNS symptoms experience fever. boggle mind? sensible government would do. US clearly sensible. overpriced anyways compared 99 cents store. Also thought viral load plays role severity. Increased prevalence mask wearing reduces viral load one sees Yes, Japan’s 800 new cases 1 new death definitely driving numbers...

Kidding, really puts perspective bad US Japan spike 800 cases day. would easily month plague “back burner”.  question schools sports.  would pretty close business usual.  no. exist trump regime.  1,000 US citizens dying day grift.   It’s teachers. It’s kids. can’t even keep hands noses mouths young ages. expect keep uncomfortable mask day, spend one room, social distance learn? Classroom management nothing it. Teachers don’t see 30 kids either. manage getting bus, walking halls, playground, using restroom, ect... sure want argue Chinese material Chinese Naw think banking attempting “hand over” little public money unemployed possible, maybe they’ll spend corporations military Florida....steady???? genuine question, cdc death rate appear slowing things I’ve seen show becoming worse? missing something?

Lol get wrecked dumbass made point back, think true, someone made great counter point. New York got ton help nurses coming helping help completely overwhelmed. simultaneous outbreaks across south, aren’t enough travel nurses go around. Whatever staff get. hospitals may able adapt surge well, potentially leading increases deaths.

Again, spots aren’t gonna become New York, worth noting multiple outbreaks really creates mess.  real life? suffering even don’t die. Wait minute, deaths lag cases? thought new cases immediately drop dead testing site anything worry about. Yeah, someone trained us public health service grant big pharma...no. main r&amp;d cost clinical trials, far, that's paid grants all. blue moon academic get govt pay trial, turn around sell resulting drug pharma (taxol way) rare trials work.

Don't let monster thought take mind . imagine ""we always said would respond things worsened"" Try Harbor Freight, local store. Thank you! 

I think common misunderstanding police make laws. true. 

The police (and sheriff) ENFORCE laws, decide unlawful. 

That role falls federal (Congress), state (every state legislation set bit differently), local governments. also garbage Americans pretty much every state flocking vacation. live Key West packed people. Read travel forums, people act absolutely clueless Covid straight DGAF.

Dumbasses everywhere, people vacationing global health pandemic special breed selfish asshole. plenty workers paid artificially inflated wages via unemployment benefits stay home. government tinkering free market throwing everything off.

Those employees happy working wages prior inflated unemployment.

I know two distribution centers area highly sought jobs. Great benefits, great conditions great wages considering skill requirement. looking hire college students available due online classes. Many adults used careers companies permanently unemployed. happen. 

And did, bad.

And was, that's big deal.

And is, that's fault.

And was, mean it. 

And did...

You deserved it. crazy “case sniffles”- Trump calls it.  federal womandate. need everyone masks. Masks. 
Not everyone wore them. Im linking photos weve seen them. 
Outdoors 
Elbow elbow indoors still dangerous. 
Numbers
The spike hasnt ended.and flat false. numbers going stabalizing. lockdowns lifting time riots mean protests started. spike started back up.
%
Jesus .Its dont know virus works. small % ok wtf even trying accomplish. accept small % death rate infections?

There alot blame go around. doubt prorests even large % doubt contributed. doesnt make racist acknowledge that. Despite twitter might say state secedes corn, make sound. FTFY. day late dollar short there!! Virus control. People listen. Mask wearing politicized....good luck America! First all, Cuomo following federal guidelines came White House send old people back nursing homes. Literally federal government told so. early pandemic new unknown virus. mistake NEVER repeated. Secondly, statistic people catching ""at home"", NYC, everyone lives top bbn other, apartment buildings, low air circulation. already well known airborne virus, makes sense. Please get head ass stop diarrhea mouth without finding facts. lawsuit governor.

http://komonews.com/news/local/new-lawsuit-challenges-wash-states-face-mask-mandate Well hospitals get money list death COVID don’t know? also NY footage paid actors freezer trucks empty want us sheep wear masks. conditioned track us tracers inoculations. Bill Gates entire world take away American freedoms. /s that's manslaughter i.e. negligent homicide. criminally prosecuted. South Carolina definitely south. North Carolina matter, definitely forgot Tennessee.   NY NJ much same. outdoor dining (with whole host social distancing guidelines), states reversed course reopening anything indoors. Better 4 million coronavirus cases laughing stock world. can't forget tattoo parlors (though know numbers compare). reason seemed urgency came reopening. mean... seriously.  Scully?! Business always maximize profits safety every time. It’s blowing areas congregate inside AC. Fuck - get deserve plan now? Wait vaccine? happens 30% population get plausible? lucky isn’t deadly. proved anything power let mildly deadly pandemic kill many us possible. know lots gyms California told could reopen July 1 (the local counties said could) June 28 said ""sorry, nope."" opened anyway. gym mean smaller gyms, 24 Hour Fitness kind gyms...like small business gyms. closed 3 months lost much money already...couldn't afford stay closed much longer. Many know outside socially distanced, technically could ""working outside friends."" 

So full lockdown like March again...people gonna go it, all. Actual Get Covid Again? It’s Unlikely, Experts Say Per CDC, infection first symptoms 7-8 days, followed another 7-8 days worsening symptoms, 10 days intensive care, last stage another five days ventilator death. Green Bay Packers already said 12,000 fans Lambeau. holds 81,000, lot empty seats social distancing. Doesn’t seem worth opening stadium people. Thank sensible explanation. plenty us public knew saving ppe hospitals. even shared meme masks worked hospitals need disease public does. Hindsight, needed fabric masks weren’t thing yet. (tips fedora) Nothing article says illegal unless voted upon. says sheriff enforce laws enacted state government personally believe right also believe masks work. Finally. Every state needs this. excuses. Anti makers warned months ago noncompliance would lead harsh crackdown behavior are. Sounds like struggling think clearly. sister works home depot would surprised amount mask related fist fights  Maybe I'm idiot want put foot mouth say but: seeing increase detected cases, positive tests have? Yeah, unfortunately Canada trying get N95 easy. Yup, us too. I’m going anywhere avoid it. working healthcare I’d pissed. nearing retirement would retired month ago, hopefully lot older staff gotten out. society get allow eat restaurants bars sans mask, go barbers social distancing impossible, open malls everyone go meanwhile people like want go gyms, indispensable part mental physical health many, many people, masks disinfect easy cake use, get told we're one's selfish? government needs stop playing favorites either commit actually getting cases control open things everyone, right open businesses politicians core voters visit say fuck everything else. Yet many countries kiss-to-greet culture better situation America.

And successful ones stopped it, temporarily, like stopped shaking hands. 

I saying lesser thing us give up, all. heck cares handshakes, anyway. Indiana Cross Roads America! least Raiders fans good. COVID-19 plague course, people love plague. vaccine approved, every American able get once.   vaccine available, could still take six months year vaccinate enough population slow vaccine ready, still tall order get lab arms Americans. lucky,"" Samant said. Hank Hill: Floridians could read they'd upset still office? likely increase especially India experiencing exponential growth US fucking even think bad guaranteeing. Sure idiots doesnt comply regardless do,so think enforcing both(strict rules +aids help them,including clean masks!) that's pretty much Fauci's saying: always going around, we'll stronger better tools devastating forever. Nah. guy *really* knows shit. Dollar Tree Family Dollar hate America much? right. talked another thread actually. Always loved Costco appreciated too. small regional hardware store required super early. Like mid April. 

But none less Walmart going first (now) good. Increase, obvious reason: second wave incoming countries want second lockdown Everyone keeps forgetting New York City. Left-wing, Right-wing, US, Europe, Asia... matter, like exist anymore. like we're largest city western hemisphere anything.  confirmed cases much lower (Edit: ""should"" be) lack tests peak, 

Now imagine country got virus way earlier, virus genome even sequenced, can't confirmation tests all. whole world berate country supposedly ""hiding"" case number. got downvoted, fixed mistake. guy piece shit actively engaged killing citizens governs. countries starting using public buildings (libraries, museums, etc) outdoors. 

Safer schools impossible, political needs alongside low infection/positivity rates. States able test trace. 

Schools manage logistics get help hiring extra aides finding space. perfect, one-room schoolhouse better nothing. One hand get it, go anywhere public it’s assumed level risk depending kind task. hand, businesses negligent various ways- circumstances can’t protected liability. kidding, that’s said month ago hospitals started reaching critical capacity   definitely get virus laden food. It’s less pressing correction make masks bad scandal. Paywall  Probably gave money.

Kind /s. Kind not. want 🇬🇧 vaccine would far impressive French folk. 12 days... august 3rd... Texas high school football starts become laughing stock entire world. sounds *imagined* wearing mask actually worn one yet. ensure make chances exposure coronavirus nearly zero?

Stay home.

In order useful, need get fit tested N95 masks requires medical clearance. go process, tell whether able wear one long often needs changed. Certainly, face shield would add protection except eating. Watch abused police people color honestly good solution. helps both(tide company dissolving employee need risk healths roof head). whole thing might wonders Chinese government's legitimacy. hard imagine Chinese citizens looking circus going across pacific new-found faith system. know getting downvoted. classic problem stats. accuracy equal percentage people *not* condition, 50% false positive rate. reasonable false positive rate, accuracy must far exceed actual cases. r/unexpectedoffice get 10 pack similar masks $7 (USD) locally, bought two packs leave one car one home.

My better masks (pre-pandemic 3M brand n95 vent another ventles mask slowly becoming unusable. (FWIW, plugged vents vented masks.) Ihave neoprene wrap around mask replaceable filters starting get worn out, needed rubber mask replaceable barrel cartridges. Evansville pretty good it. gas stations though made annoyed Trump go get Big Macs KFC?! Yes ramped sanctions Crimea annexation. ...? They're not. business model, they're regulations.

Also, NOTHING comment... make right something? mean, pandemic can't isolate problem. shit smears over. can't play politics virus. get point needs close 100%  don’t think good way looking it. many people possible wearing it. better. someone thinks it’s nothing, see someone else wearing it, could say oh well guess doesn’t matter don’t. slippery slope think. sleep night?

Lots money, that's how. isn’t clear comment. talking family news last week 21 yr old son hung friends caught Covid, brought home family members, dad ended vent ICU? 

And you’re saying saw wife saying husband longer vent?

If so, that’s awesome news. wore N95 4 hr flight CO. nightmare. Especially watched people walk bathroom sans mask. Uh...no shit? think likely combination mixed ""it's big deal"" ""the odds low.""

Bad combination. talking about? bet even half state tested... scary think..possibly half state infected First infected yet. People can't usually know day infection, though people guess risky activity specific day attend party, eat restaurant, meet someone turned Covid. know could exposed last 2 weeks? RemindMe! 1 month mind boggling. able leverage learnings one McDonald’s, one Walmart one Apple store across whole US. experts economies scale. this...  Kansas volunteers tribute case anyone else wondering commenter meant ""used vaccinations way find guardian reports CIA organized fake vaccination drive elaborate way get Osama family's DNA. Wild. IMO virus culling herd. Weeding weak, genetically/medically predisposed.  Hey pot, black too.

Not everyone US responsible response. Republican party is. Full stop. PoC? Wait no, told heat would make go away though! made much sense! Ah well, back drinking cleaning supplies subjecting harmful radiation! Yeah, even Americans mask policies, still one BC remind fuckers Rick Scott Committed fuck ton Medicare Fraud still elected shitbag. Yeah even say reason post. Conflicting info fault trying figure like rest us assume. article freedomfoundation democrat saying thing republican said.  surprised insurance companies actively investing vaccine development. Insurance companies kind fascinating different various things try reduce chance claims cost claims. 

I tax job insurance company primarily operated one region two big cities. scanning invoices found actually purchased cameras police cities, mounted police cruisers, hooked computer system. cameras scan license plates passing cars, compare number cars registered stolen. effectively police cruiser could drive parking garage scan every plate see cars stolen. 

I've also seen safe driving campaigns funded insurance companies, health fitness programs sports tournaments supported them, lot companies actually get big discount insurance smoking cessation healthy lifestyle encouraging programs business. Financing vaccine research absolutely question.  agree you, America #1 joke regarding Covid sooo tired learning use thing neck. Life isn’t fair method literally describing excess mortality works. 

They look death certificates certain causes compare normal number. couple adjusters hospital deaths. one USA believes that, many people know personally defending wearing mask nothing... using OSHA standards reference. Don’t sorry, people shouldn’t expect civility calling people liars rude way.  Hopefully goes more.  testing /data points always good thing. I’m sorry families loss. know someone passed last week Texas too, it’s insane none cities lockdown general public doesn’t care. It’s gonna bloodbath over. Stay safe. So.. would give loved one mouth mouth try get breathing going again? Knowing may virus?  death rate important, accurate, statistic. Actually, yeah. felony knowingly put public safety health risk. Oh thousand cases bad!
Wait they're cases, they're deaths... good job showing masks need political math expect 200k total US deaths around end August potential 50k additional September unless reverse curve extreme way. agree statement don’t get paid “deaths”. I’m saying benefits hospital classify patient Covid patient get extra funding patients dies, certain death isn’t recorded covid death vs whatever else? Ah yes, smoke cigarette Oval office like Goya beans. Good them. Always fav airline. Mostly cause triangle, it’s favorite airline logo like them, also family member like 10 million miles gets tickets sometimes. right conflicting info fault proving point? Sounds like agenda he's trying figure thing out. need treatment covid covid. Maybe could try mandating masks everyone already Nice see someone finally using tests way might actually provide useful data. wonder traveling state lot it? opens whole worms giving people power murder citizens...innocent proven guilty, justice...mob mentality crazy people killed innocent victims misunderstanding. get cough mid flight...gunna toss plane sure? could chocked bit water everyone’s panicking cough oops I’m dead. rules follow handing punishments civilized folks do. It’s hunger games It’s like couldn’t follow correlation increased cases increased deaths weeks later. doesn’t take epidemiologist understand increased cases means increased deaths short time later. Given case numbers sky rocketed I’d surprised don’t hit 2000 deaths day long.

To clear _hope_ happens. won’t surprised does. Wouldn’t first time 🤷🏻‍♂️ Dude serious hard link. It’s like thinks found Holy Grail information must post again! realize two posts satirical, right?  mean pretty big hassle easy make be. two working parents can't afford daycare juggle work legit education. make sound simple criticize people easy say that's generally true californian expats. they're looking lower cost living, bad conservative parts california. one drives crazy. ‘good works done, service God vanity.’ ‘Yes well don’t anything kind anytime all, Sheryl!’  lot guys work keep saying coroners marking every death corona related. I’m wondering bs got started none could probably tell me. Even smart people know getting ""bored"" following proper public health guidelines. I'm struggling explain *people Ph.D.s* kind thing half-ass: Either absolutely everyone right thing 3-4 weeks get outbreak control, *aaaaaalllllllllllll* grandmas die. parents call 'Ditmer'. infuriating best strategy seems saying penalties don’t want enforced. Police don’t time mask police every city state knows this. admitting there’s zero penalty usually means 50%-60% people comply.  That's bugged man. proud prepared. I'm getting tired winning. paid attention MERS SARS... still don’t effective vaccines. figured much *sigh*.

So ask mother trying buy father new set masks. We've quarantined 2 weeks st point want something catch breath st time prevent getting virus since bought cloth masks friend. friends grew flying model airplanes. know, ones 85% methanol 15 % castor oil. got ourselves, breathed vapors routinely. we’re perfectly n n n normal. race Indians? Holcomb Pence Light. good leadership state decades. Wait...I online classes 2 months already...you guys it?  American, confirm. 9/11 every 3 days.

I bet month 9/11 every day.

This trumps america.  achieve ~~an alterior motive / goal~~ safety people risk looking dead face hours time, day day out

Yes. Indiana basically free there. felt like biggest weirdo stores. one wearing mask. Well, um... discharge code medicare instructs hospitals use pronouncing normal death, im sure theyre reimbursing it, + anything else charged discharge (covid stuff, maybe modifier? Idk), anyway 30.6.9.2 E, 30.6.13 I.  
 http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/Downloads/clm104c12.pdf There's like thousands sicknesses. odds covid small. relax today get sleep. Eat pho drink lots water go tomorrow It’s terrifyingly consistent. Every time stories states reopening, gatherings, people heeding warnings number ways...track 2-3 weeks infection clusters, 2-3 weeks that, maybe more, death rates spike. People paying attention, it’s horrifying. looking this.. Unfortunately really buried.

Hospitals make LOT money in-house elective procedures. right people declining - would walk covid hospital get preventative MRI, example, could put ambiguous point future.

People going end complications road deferring diagnostic procedures. that's risk people weigh themselves, unfortunately. country Anglo sphere brain liquefying Murdoch news channel. gives hope country still one. regional rivalry already problem. prairies went entirely conservative last election fortunately dont population get many seats parliament. sometimes wonder less populous states much power country.   fault Feds states like Florida following advice.  forget rampant racism, dismantling current institutions like CDC USPS dept education, already glaring lack social safety nets accessible affordable healthcare... around fucking good all. heard good source people born finite amount energy, like battery, exercising drains battery, shortens Life!

Far safer simply take risk. Houston problem Toronto outbreak SARs. Thé lots cases too. made sure classify vague terms “respiratory illness”. US media demonized Toronto epicentre major pandemic. SARS fairly contained. Yep. work employee standing door telling people masks required giving (for free) one. 
If tell employee medical condition still allow in. employee least warns rest us walkie talkie stay hell away person. bullshit. Lockdowns unnecessary people follow protocols.  Nailed it.  simply mandate masks. strange think someone going BBQ event month later they're dead simply went. sad time like ""hey, told thing bad"" would ramp protests civil unrest. People fucked mask, small inconvenience. Think access vital part life sudden. deal.....Sorry. outdoors wind carry dilute aerosols. Indoors builds room slowly exiting distant ventilation duct, likely crossing paths many people gets there. bet smoke inside buildings, decline wear seatbelt, run every red light come across too. go 40 school zone smoke gas pump huh? Imagine USA cared people. would great nation. Apparently little link protests case spikes. were, we'd seeing huge spikes New York City, Boston, Minneapolis, DC, Chicago, etc. we're seeing that.

The places we're seeing spikes States reopened bars, restaurants, gyms, etc. fast. Close, indoor spaces people wearing masks. Sweet, I'm missing square bingo board  Yeah Hoosier, surprised well Michigan, Illinois, Ohio getting bad. But, southern part state probably fuck spike cases People give fuck Drunk drivers unlikely kill crash modern safety equipment car design. let continue drive drunk otherwise economic impact bars would huge. I’ve done opposite started smoking almost year smoking. Give time catch see decide info. US place made thing political. pathetic. Donald said lowest death count.

He lied.....could he? I've started approaching gun control societal perspective, rather individual one. Owning rifle really keeping personal house safe -- definitely that, best way reduce crime investment education, family planning, job opportunities. But, societal level, whole neighborhood armed together, makes lot scarier federal secret police come try abuse rights. 

That's I'm challenging beliefs everything happening, anyways. need start making fake videos libs triggered seeing people masks solve weeks. Provided number go up. No, separate category : ""China"" I’ve known people gotten sick flu vaccine. Maybe full blown flu sick nonetheless. think lot people would rather risk get sick sure. There's also worrying issue long term damage virus cause.

There's cases show severe lung damage post recovery.

Who knows people crop 5, 10, 20 years due virus.

It's definitely better avoid costs absolutely know nothing long terms effects. Deniers going rely fact personally know someone affected covid real.

They live small bubble, vote, watch type news agrees them.

The people deny covid look personal interests.

Just facts. Oh yeah, six months I'm thinking things ease bit. it'll well next year see significant progress. Testing like 35% meanwhile cases close 200%, testing. Shit getting worse. also lot terrible governors blame IMO didn’t say racist, pointing double standard. Nothing link supports argument. partner go morning get crown replaced I’m super concerned. don’t want exposed COVID due dentist don’t really options isn’t something wait on. wouldn’t crown literally fell exposed root painful. Look sorry doubting. quite like Trump hate cursed site make everything blame him, like dude. position likely could anything better yet would try hardest. really wish could balanced conversation sides. training class supervisors Job Plainfield Indiana 1 person people wear mask nose everyone else either doesnt wear one nose. annoying sad tbh Add ended pie nonetheless. testing allows us really effective hospitals. Hospitals booked sending lot people back home treatment. Thanks putting work. 

Remind me! August 30. Let put perspective you:

Some people fucking retarded precisely kind person happen be.  cases COVID suddenly going super bad terrifying me. i’m 19F, 125lbs, healthy. i’m currently antibiotics treated swollen lymph node sore throat. doctor told needed tested anything else, sometimes read horror stories people “only sore throat oxygen levels suddenly dropping die heat stopped suddenly” sends full blown panic attack. remember calm happens? always think worst case scenario think maybe i’ll somehow one horror stories. things really rare? terrifies end see feels like many sub reddit’s like COVID19_support COVID19positive whatever. please help. :( mexicans hoping border. Mexico getting anihilated get it... saw coming. Even Kayleigh McEnany vehemently downplayed press conferences ""more testing means cases"".... saw right lies. What's defense now? Remember earlier year people (me included) saying act become next Italy everyone scoffed? contact tracing controlling outbreak Rhode Island. 

I swear morons want people die jack thought right good question! long ACA intact, cannot. gets repealed changed, yes. [go marinate LA County 1/3 state's cases. conservative strongholds... Yeah sure. Indeed impressive. expected see asymptomatic carriers coming days.

I also curiously looking forward investigation get first place. long, long stay asymptomatic far understand, since last case Xinjiang current cluster. start wedding right? info tracing origin? It’s really like 51 people calling shots deciding many people die.

I don’t blame citizens wearing masks little urgency instilled governors Da Prez. “If Trump doesn’t wear mask to?” 6 months probably optimistic. rate, we're fucked least well next spring. Winter/holiday season going inject absolute rocket fuel crisis know now. What's confusing keep seeing articles numbers day higher Worldometers. getting numbers from? told hoax. type hoax impacts many humans?  not. ? California is. imagine ones. guess depends definition ""lockdown"" probably Chinese's interest first come vaccine. tempt United States spread freedom democracy China. whole point flatten curve. way gonna prevented.  I’m Australian attitude also. sick leave entitlements full time employees many workplace cultures don’t encourage use sick leave. One previous employers example reduced annual bonus $50 first three sick days took. pretty bad policy. 

We also situation increasingly workforce employed casual basis casual workers don’t sick leave entitlements. seems really coming head us aged care facilities workers coming work sick mild symptoms don’t get paid don’t turn up, also working multiple jobs across multiple centres, spreading virus widely vulnerable people.

Decades Australian cold flu ads: *Florida announces reverse lockdown, making illegal stay home mandatory attend Disney World* anything, literally way around.

There's suspicious ~3x increase pneumonia related deaths states since pandemic started.

But nah, covid related all. man! YES! This! tou go award: 💎  bet stays home day afraid catching himself. worry, president supporters continue ignore problem say everything fine. free point, protect homies  it’s contagious disease absolutely great treatment cure? isn’t common cold flu odds death serious injury even survive low super low. undercounting believed people dying home may never know cause arent testing dead leaves guesswork proabablies maybes. However know currently counting deaths arent really people dying covid. things admit to. states like Colorado started totals 'with Covid' 'from Covid' people get clearer picture like asked. states media sides generally even using deaths 'with Covid' group fear monger like recently Florida saying young people dying Covid. major parties Colorado state know far separating public viewing. check jobs everyday, there's nothing there. Millions laid off, dozen job openings arent taken damn good reason. 

The job openings look like this

 ""Wanted manager blah blah. Duties include vacuuming office, operating forklift warehouse, sewing quilt day, accounting payroll, creating website, IT, travelling main location 78 miles away daily meetings corporate, training overseeing staff 300 people. Must speak Irish, English, French, Japanese fluently. Must masters degree, twenty two years experience, must familiar program company uses ours. report 9 bosses. Three related owner 3 personal ass kissers. One goes KKK meetings. benefits free coffee every morning. Starting $10-12 hour.""


 

Or job openings vague ""hey amazon, home depot, ups, usps always hiring city across state listed town"" Depends excess mortality rate. Yeah shaming really works women piss floor response asked wear mask, men stab grocery workers asked same.

Social shaming works someone values opinion. Well, works make feel righteous, that’s it. It’s masturbatory. people go ventilators. people couldn’t get hospital help occupancy booked due COVID. It’s deaths dookie head love ""someone died car crash counted covid hometown"" excuse. shits closed. uncle thinks Florida's case counts fake ""how even test many people one day?"" Flew AA recently. aren’t enforcement. Saw people masks around neck whole flight. Let’s see... ~350 million people US, commenter says ~350k deaths/yr, let’s basic math determine whether “until everyone dead” remotely possible. Nope, possible. terrible situation. don’t need pretend like it’s worse. Ok...so today listened Trump justify sending federal forces cities arrest people state local governments 7,500 black men killed every year, 7,000 dead per fucking *week* said quote “it is”.  great time open schools say bury lead least part Canada. right sue though? job 100 % remote want us back. period time April state New York 1,000 daily deaths several days row. fine I'll call lol. think everyone, least ""good"" people think way. friend told he'd got know elderly woman next door they'd chat then. guess felt comfortable assumed he'd agree said another neighbor ""That n****r know place."" 3 years ago. Naturally put end chit chats. walked back admitted made mistake announcing public. Doh agree fully excuse shouldn’t succumbed pressure begin No, much higher early on. one reliable models. Well lets see death charts - trump Thanks man. 

I (was) pretty active, pretty handy feel pulse. goes ~5bpm check it. it’s hard ignore it’s pounding ears neck fingers days end.

I hope you’re well away home, you’re probably safer there, honestly. 

I love cooking actually, grocery pickup made chore. get probably 90% whatever order, don’t really know what’s missing weird ass substitutions made get home (they substituted small pack cheese 4lb, $25 brick cheddar. decided give pasta, instead giving angel hair instead spaghetti??? It’s real great substitute almond milk milk. Thanks assholes.) think it’s control thing. Like can’t even control food I’m making tonight, I’m piecing together whatever bullshit store gave me, fuck going actual store.

It’s like really boring game chopped, every episode “well guess put frittata”, lmao.

It guess. hungry. frustrated. Frustrated tied. low hope. angry. would cool though going pediatrician's office, call tell possible covid cases, let tell do. re-elect Trump would confirmation. There's coming back that. confirm John Wilkes Boothe wearing mask. Same. I’m tired essential ready able quarantine home everyone else. (It won’t happen I’m still ready it.) swear fuck point people must kids dying arms still saying masks wont help. I've casually watching Snowpiercer, I'm pretty slow, finally realised train economy. cannot stop. must keep going. matter cost lives. must continue rationality. Depends is--there's entire smorgasbord different rationalizations I've seen different people.

A big one see ""psh, people die [insert normal activity people always die from, okay]. worry this, then? everyone freaking car crashes??? still driving cars! Gotcha!"" like watching Titanic hit iceberg

every 24-36 hours. would afraid something dont think real?  Iv'e also seen posts/memes Facebook suggesting COVID created lab vaccine profit. 

Iv'e lost hope point idiots world. I’m curious know much profit hospital inflate numbers. Reports said, someone died due existing condition, Covid, would write Covid death It’s mixture initial exposure, pre existing conditions, age. Low exposer relatively healthy person turn different high exposer unhealthy person. Communism defined ""things like"" department shut since April. scheduled reopen end August, virus' resurgence, might pushed back early November. Unemployment, savings, gig work keeping family afloat, bulk UI expire dig deeper already depleted savings.

To clear, closure due government mandate, we're considered essential, closed outbreak department would cripple business. U.K., specifically England pretty resistant masks. Euro countries masks aren’t used pretty effective contact tracing place they’re catching outbreaks fast. It’s keeping numbers now. We’ll see goes. They’re holding NE. everyone else taking measures. eternal pessimist, I'm skeptical. countries USA says ""lol watch burn million barrels oil pwn libs"". Plant trees? Turn CO2 CaCO3? Releasing CO2 much easier containing it. Fuck Leafs, amen Wow. Yeah focus TTSD. community meeting last night shit show. Talked plans didn’t address risks polled group via Zoom giving false sense security. 65% voted favor hybrid model 35% remote only. 

I know North Clackamas remote November least Lake remote first 2 weeks least. BSD go remote profound effect. Yes people get cancer people die.  truth calls, best say fuck feelings accept it. never said video. saying CDC mentioned article. girlfriend come show guidline tips summin

&amp;#x200B;

This thing bit Discumbobulated Blessed pi day yellows lemon, banana. reason. Peace ✌️ works me. friends...it's middle finger.  I'm Georgia going get tested tomorrow. sick sore throat &amp; congestion week &amp; took week finally get appointment even getting appointment fight. 11m old also sick corona he, hopefully &amp; take doctor make sure he's okay. Going health department cvs, they're still saying 3-10 days average. Anyone else get told &amp; took longer? tips expect? Agreed. like alternative bowing. need dick pullers ever touch. Ma'm, put mask courtroom. 

Fine, sign sworn affidavit I'm never going wear one, ever again. Who'da thunk it? seems fake. 

the real guy paper mill stuff lists publications appear it. also use gmail address real papers, massimo.fioranelli@gmail.com whereas paper regarding covid 19 use m.fioranelli73@gmail.com. see seems earlier example: really know id email real guy fun internet rabbit hole honestly dont care. now, this:  welcome. Fuck southern Indiana northern Indiana isn’t awful (east Laporte/starke/pulaski counties bc yikes)

I may biased Again, death rate? Where? provided evidence all. even provided *location*.  couple things put perspective.

we eradicated 2 diseases planet, smallpox rinderpest.

the bubonic plague still around. another case year us. antibiotics rendered greatest plague history almost afterthought.

H1N1 common flu strain 2018. viral lineage spawned spanish flu 1918 swine flu. 

these plagues continually fade away resurface. yes, covid fade, may come back later date. key keep eye aggressive strains, take appropriate actions contain them. They’re getting Coco now? much flu shot cost? It’s free Ontario yet people still don’t get it. needs higher   can't math. 365,000 people year, every year handled. Good luck, fam. trying ID symptomatic cases testing contacts that's possible right US instead we're testing bunch randos hoping take week get result back cowards. 🤯  Yep employers deserve get sued negligence causing public health violation.

To let employees WFH 100% able to: employee, BETTER believe family hesitate sue!

Also, RIP public health worker 🙏 Thanks! got several orders friends family, houses. Step one don’t lie citizens! sure getting downvoted, right. business perspective issue simple looks surface. things mention legitimate concerns. I'm glad make decisions that's sure.   Depends type flu. baffles large proportion population think guess science. many people know (annoyingly mostly family) like 'nah hunch cases going stay ' etc....It's almost like forget science literally based facts good science says happen, almost undoubtedly will. Trust want go there. America freedom compared countries, sure, - no. America lot going it, also lot issues. bad thing point areas could improve on, wrong want better, fairer inclusive. would genuinely interested know ways consider free?  kind unpatriotic American wear mask Trump told unpatriotic to? manufacturing process use case? Fantastic. ok shoplifting anything want. lots people stolen stuff pulling gun. basically go back store let customers anything want. I’m ya buddy. wanted school remote well. *Yuge Yup Walmart et Al enforce policies something special Lowe's customers? buy it. others enforce policies Lowe's. 

Doing otherwise means give shit customers employees health, think unenforced policy enough fend lawsuits.  reason can’t hire people? workers aren’t willing risk health well families working unsafe conditions due virus?

It's unemployment benefits. least that's people call interviews say. applicants applying soon find job pays less unemployment withdrawal application. even say apply benefits run out.

Edit: downvoted telling truth. Reddit. Sorry fit narrative. Lol. Yeah got flu 10 weeks last baby told lucky gotten vaccine baby could died. attribute fact never spiked fever vaccinated. Wow, done amazingly well! Definitely go look, great sub.  Awkward! Hey pot, meet kettle. That's I've seeing stores. suspicions helping cases grow...

Also numbers kinda shady believe them, hardly anyone wears masks many people gone Florida back vacation.

Southern Indiana getting shout shittiest place hilarious true.  aren’t mutually exclusive.

It true many hospitals taken large financial losses due unprecedented drop elective procedures, many cases reducing furloughing staff. 

It also true hospitals taken hits revenue paid COVID patients, thus creating incentive test even asymptomatic patients and, positive, classify COVID patients even knee replacement tonsils out. 

It seems common PCR test results come back positive even weeks person recovered. 

Is increased testing bad thing? No, it’s probably good thing cases found spread within hospital prevented. increase number “COVID hospitalizations” patient may severe case may even asymptomatic / recovered. 

Despite that, even worst hit states right now, like Texas Florida, 16% hospital patients COVID positive, per CDC data. Again, many hospitalized *with* COVID *because* COVID.  makes going sporting event concert different protest? Wait, mean that's SUPPOSED happen exercise?

Although that's obviously hard put concrete number data incomplete. They’re conflating Medicare reimbursing Covid patients “hospitals get paid Covid deaths”.
 
Covid patients require care. care billed Medicare. Medicare reimburses care thanks CARES act. hard wear mask? hate wearing one I'm going I'm stupid. really hard?  addition poster said, many stores super rural areas hard pressed find someone would willing that. many cases able even find someone they'd likely specifically brag they're getting paid store intentionally *not* enforcing it. people wear masks according multiple polls. people support lockdowns.

We see small amount people refuse masks.

However, behavior ridiculous, becomes emphasized media. Like crime, decline decades, coverage anti-makers get, people think happens.

What I'm saying many metrics, like polling hospital data, problem remained open public Pretty ignorant Disclaimer: scientist/ doctor
Yes, hiv attacks specifially cd4 cd 8 cells I’m mistaken recognize virus instruct cells die become infected virus. cells, especially paired B cells Provide protective immunity also even don’t make infection less severe second time around. It’s hopeful sign able cells provide protection Yeah LOT sense taste smell, asperating virus time giving path lungs? Honest question. Thank you. 3,000 deaths day, I’d wager get point people won’t care. surpass number, people continue caring. Exactly this. listened group celebrating, ready start cheering, C19 info would longer going CDC. believed CDC deliberately inflating statistics testing people died cause, assigning death C19 system C19 death. headline mean suggest panic would be... good thing? Build temporary overflow facilities using tents, school gyms etc, like many places done hitting capacity. Oh boy... Death Panel arrived. question RO disease drops heat Brought guy as

* HCQ+ works!
* New, Serious COVID-19 Mutation Worry About

The guy seems investment advisor, obviously know talking about. even watch videos, guy's selling clickbait. He's fearmonger.  Username checks stop checking sick patients! checked half them, number deaths would cut half! course there's going deaths LOOKING them! /s Yes patients. Living breathing patients.

That’s conspiracy theory states. conspiracy claims hospitals get extra money over-reporting deaths that’s death counts high.

But there’s incentive report deaths. incentive report confirmed cases need medical care. TCell immunity probably full immunity. may lessen symptoms decrease chance infection symptoms. situation like prison ward everyone packed together sharing large viral loads, infection probably likely even degree protection. fastest way end pandemic everyone wash, mask distance. three things need done. Can't wear mask get people. Hand hygiene like life depended it. 

If everyone completely vigilant all, would completely different situation months.

It's crazy talking, never remotely going happen. 

""Muh free-dumbs!!!"" disagree never got use it, partner gives hard time using bottled water. makes much sense now! anything said? I'm saying conspiracy theorists correct happening. read?

I'm actually trying help dude youre going sound dumb af argument person someone like correct side sound dumb bad arguments.

Ok I'll make SUPER simple since trouble.

Let's say bad evil doctor doesnt give shit. patient lung issues need treat respirator didnt tests time. would behoove claim COVID get extra money even knew actually Flu.

If person dies, wrongly inflate death total.

Are lost yet? pointing THEORETICALLY bad doctor COULD use game system.

Now counter argument asking evidence fraud actually occuring. whistleblower? recorded coversation? leaked e-mail hospital admins telling people this? anything?

No don't.

So claim Hospitals THEORETICAL incentive lie 100% true. go around saying people look dumb.

It's similar claims mail-voting fraud. Could happen? Sure. incentive people this? Sure.

Is evidence happens non-negligible level? NO!

Same argument. making audacious claim fraud. burden proof them. Simply telling ''Well might incentive'' nowhere near enough.

But pretending get extra money claiming patients COVID factually incorrect. I'm sorry loss ♥️ Yea possibly, least wearing masks. Hopefully stadium doesn’t force people smaller areas/hallways/entrances less fans. Definitely makes humid me. moustache goatee soaked wear awhile. He’s smoking crack. two months useful flatten curve give doctors science head start. 

That say relax. national mask mandates, reasonable testing situation, bans large crowds indoor venues. 

But helpful truthful push idea efforts put useless. blue dot sea red, firmly believes 52nd state legalize marijuana extremely likely new Guantanamo, I'm almost proud state. difference anti-mask protesters wearing masks BLM protests seen organized mask rule try masks hand provide people. There's articles sub pretty frequently mask wearing prevents transmission epidemiologists contact tracers finding many cases linked protests (likely mask mandates).

The thing population health preventive measures matter statistics. witnessing murders happening Portland cities, seeing erosion civil liberties. go one protests risk, masks really cut spread (hence recent cases population spread a.k.a parties taking precautions). honestly, think lot people criticizing BLM protests bias. public health professionals repeating facts, change time, population hear restrictions encouraged. numbers pointing protests source increase time stop using people responsible every way. rich people would gained slightly less money year. obviously better choice. Rest piece him. Nobody deserves this. borderline involuntary manslaughter like New York. bad didn’t learn  Adults better developed brains respond faster. also tend fall asleep randomly. says don't? matter. showing shred compassion makes fucking psycho. Fuck you. really really hope one idiots thinks wearing masks inhibits freedom. Hospitals **do not** get money Covid deaths.
 
Stop propagating misinformation pandemic. You’re problem.  “1000 people isn’t even much compared population US” hear Fox News commentators now. Yes possibly true. Though case fatality rate calculated quite recent numbers would improvements last months.

Also average age infection dropped could reduce CFR well. And?

The point they’ve consistently rising. Won’t enforced used slap easy misdemeanors people? Wanna put good news flair this?! 😎 Yup. Especially couple months ago TV talking bad lockdowns would use people would lose jobs would cause externalities. Sorry Texas, looks like getting both! Covid fairy puts money pillow person dies virus. cash cow hospitals. oh lmao. hurricane/tornado season already? Back March predicted NY got control states would spike time. difficult predict, Simple kind odd virus getting crazier closer elections. keep saying ""soon"" keep adding ""far over"" keep eyes polls watch news might surprise you. daughter went library tonight, woman walked front desk. mask, son didn't. librarian told needed mask. Mom ok said ok, walked away, turning free mask. son proceeds cough, librarian insists mask. Mom says, ""its ok, allergies"". Son chimes in, ""but mom, fever went away yesterday.""

She said almost lost shit seeing go down.  severely limited number test. Texas articles coming large number people dying home suddenly. strange. Wonder could related? /s Hospitals get money COVID patients.
 
Hey look. Somebody doesn’t pay attention things they’re responding to.
 
This isn’t argument. 
 
Hospitals **do not** get money Covid deaths. also mask bylaws people pre symptomatic can’t spread virus. security cameras there? Surely grounds calling police. started new job Feb county’s health dept. could 99% job home, kick scream crazy person rule couldn’t work home unless one year. Rules rules one willing squeaky wheel say shit never anticipated - except - new RN didn’t know better. FFS, didn’t want look bad. It’s first government job it’s weird.

Districts: cut budget? right. would want injected rushed vaccine nonsense virus deadlier seasonal flu. Cmon dude, there's word look up. Mitigation. Try see fits here. There's way vectors could list want play game.

Yup stopped drinking tap water tastes sweet Ohio River Valley, lead acetate old pipes lead leaches several dozen National Priority List (sometimes called superfund) sites Jefferson County, KY.

It may sound bad, there's actually superfund sites west Evansville. I'd posit worse pretty much disease we've faced civilization.

The Black Death worse. Way worse. fracturing nation's social cohesion is, indeed, devastating. Black Death fucked beyond imagination - Plague Justinian.  Yeah, wish true. see, ackshually, people would gone hospital, scared go. Gotta keep quiet parts quiet. think people go work feel little bit off, well, nothing discuss us that.

That said many people weaker version even ever know it!!!! keep going work. RemindMe! 30 days  Oh thought typo chuckled, realized actually meant poop. People keeping voting Republican enabling sort thing continually screwing average American, even themselves. ""We tens thousands die flu""

""Because Americans stupid get vaccine""

It's people ""too stupid"" get vaccine. I've vaccinated nearly every year flu gotten times life. Plenty people die despite vaccinated. person understand vaccines work. clearly stated? look full context. instead admitting read deflect fault me? Brittle ego? 

My comment warranted zero replies. made comment incorrect statement. one come like know-it-all reason. Again, ego. 

And influenza vaccine typically 45-55 percent effective. combination vaccine efficiency herd immunity keeps infection lower. Thousands still die even ""aMeRiCaNs sTuPiD gEt VaCcInE"". person clue actually works. 

Pretty obvious implied context entire thread. Maybe reading comprehension needs work. Rectum? hardly touched em! person took picture said didnt mask unrelated eating/drinking. think 2 hour video wearing mask photo dicking around phone neither eating drinking. infections lead tests, way around. much like blame Republicans. (Which deserved IMO) many friends democrats completely put COVID back burner. need better. People selfish ignorant think pandemic response President's job description? opinion I've never seen expressed completely agree with. horrible, sure, based body count plenty horrible worse things happen nobody gives fuck. America worldwide. Yep :/ Abbott called National Guard assistance Comfort Mercy dock Houston take overflow? aren’t saying it’s happening, saying morons believe it. point-they actually believe hospitals committing fraud.  “At least still freedom!”

As watch armed feds ID full military gear march residential streets dragging unarmed citizens away gun point unmarked vans undisclosed locations indefinite amounts time. get money patients. Live breathing (barely) patients. incentive lying saying confirmed cases.

They get extra money dead body. incentive lie overreport deaths, conspiracy theory claims. Hmm? like Trump? No. sucks. Nice try though. wondering country OP from. Obviously they're embarrassed say. Yea , really wasn’t expecting implement masks Sorry loss, friend. Fuck that, fuck rushed vaccines Oh, sorry. second graders ones going slammer then!  they'll poor disenfranchised always done: depend family other, die droves. call sister mother neighbor go ""what yours? mine stay work? safe"". maybe leave youngest slightly older siblings hope best. maybe keep home fail year, feel bad, like bad parent, least burying kid, elderly dad, hope get bury they're little really deal.

Or send school go fuck take chances. Maybe get it. do, bad. Maybe get it, get it. Maybe fat death sentence. Maybe. Thank that.

Yeah, I'm saying. yes, that's they're saying *now.*

But first said hospitals get money list death COVID don’t know? [...] /s

And mixed sarcastic conspiracy stuff, implying ""crazy conspiracy nutter bullshit."" agree, stupid conspiracy.

Except, first sentence (which quoted there), true.

That's whole point. I'm literally saying, ""Well, yeah they're nuts, first thing conspiracy, technically true."" 

Then, got called it, walked back, responding treatment yes deaths. read?

Then, claimed (repeatedly) know hospitals earn money billing COVID-19 deaths. But...re-read first comment again. Clearly, that's thought begin with.

To honest, think got caught saying something untrue, tried walk back, started using really rude, personal language people, got involved. think good way discuss things, think leapt anger much quickly. 

In short, think mean, hate seeing people that.

I can't believe I've typed much this. honestly wouldn't, something misinterpreted profoundly really drives nuts. Used talk lot MO people phone old job... best got far  kind crimes foresee skyrocketing? think someone making $400 week UI gonna forced perform strong arm robberies get by? Exactly! Perhaps im particular imperialist country.  long friend. Mass also yet see spike things popping Italy first time. y’all ban Floridians Texans entering state? not, expect see another spike Insantis think mean private school kids go to, gigabit internet line state art video conferencing hardware. mean schools poor kids go to. Hahahaha fucking way! #staythefuckhome  500 years now, people wonder mighty US lost population within years became irrelevant human history. answer quite simple, yet harder believe: wear damn masks rest world wore them. there's lot people tested, numbers could higher  Whoosh New Zealand, number countries, 0 cases. yeah, eliminating real possibility. 

Also, vaccines thing. one within 12 months, almost certainly significantly sooner. likely one production distribution end year - maybe given everyone January 1st 2021 *yet*, chances we'll getting people risk. Unless fetus, case coronavirus affect fetuses. Maybe care fetuses. said do, think listen words coming mouths often. anyway, fetus going aborted, care deeply it. fetus gets coronavirus dies, care? Plus, care anyone else dies, unless try kill themselves, case, they're really that. try kill getting Coronavirus? many percentage points Wall Street move OK kill Gamma? Gamma, I'd rewriting leave house secret stash gold medical research charity. explaining common knowledge like insightful. Stop fucking protesting rally's large group people congregating virus beat. pretty simple Canada say hell want kicked covids ass staying home. American's bless hearts. Stop coming reasons leave house damn fools. US generous Agent Orange stuff back then. bad nuke, hurts harm today. *Governor DeathSentence*

FTFY  makes sense, too. Based reported data, estimate many fewer people driving?  Funny-ish story. (As funny anything really point.) 
Came across fb post. friend basically calling anti-maskers friend list. One dude tried argue he’s likely get car accident test positive covid. next comment family friend told brother, sister-in-law, kids, dad gotten positive results basically called stupid. Apparently they’d tried texting response saw comment. America. Dumbest country earth agreeing assessment **eradication** via 3 week lockdown likely impossible, outlining previous response fucking PhD virology... almost 9/11 every 3 days. Remember united 9/11. 

I cannot believe I’m longing leader like Bush 2 so, would make different outcome Seattle &amp; Minneapolis protests. two biggest nation, associated Covid uptick minimal. 

Then again, protesters tend fit certain demographics they’re likely believe science reality wear masks accordingly. antibody tests prone false positives? fucking heartbreaking women, sell gun carriers, essentially fancy purse gun. stumbled across Etsy. I’m Canada too, realizing guns MUCH part daily life America blew mind. sister lives (ugh, move home already) used go see her, would trip knowing probably 90% people carrying gun. Whhhhhyyyyyyyy? Right now, I'd put stupid way higher 10%... U.S. least. disagree, far right parties Europe want immigrants out, Alot love Trump Tea Party sure hell condemn policies Bernie Sanders leftist mean much hospitals capacity. **A Narcissist's Prayer**

The deaths happen.

And did, bad.

And was, that's big deal.

And is, that's fault.

And was, mean it.

And did...

You deserved it. understand closing gyms understand virus better, im really convinced heavy breathing itself=aerosolizing. I’m RN wear surgical masks covid tbh permeable cloth masks. close quarters confirmed covid patients day definitely breathing heavy coughing frequently. move N95s super high flow oxygen, intubation, etc. despite we’ve basically 0 worker transmission.

Also keep mind plenty nurses pretty shitty following precautions. Nurses still eat station, throw potlucks, stand close groups gossip.

Until data proved gyms fine totally board staying closed, reddit likes act like sure thing im convinced. coupled small percentage population actually works im skeptical gyms themself noticeable impact positive negative. government Sorry. ""U.S."" ""Receive free."" Ummm.... what? world Mississippi do? finally see bodies piling streets? Fucking Jared already bitched one yet respond. Cowards.

[Fuck it, I'll link random sampling population, grabbed antibody data swabs. closest get real numbers. nabs lot asymptomatic cases miss general public.

False positive negatives, can't comment much that, although tests getting better knowledge. Great. gave idea. say “a people” felt sick flu vaccines say vaccine make “get sick sure”. straight misinformation needs stop spread. 

That misinformation responsible portion people getting vaccines, bad. also pushes anti-vac agenda “vaccines bad you”, not. 

A small percentage people standard immune response inactivated virus flu vaccine. includes low-grade fever, body aches, headache, overall feeling illness lasts one two days. Far “guaranteed”, happens small portion receive flu vaccine. want know anybody died? Wait, Ohio? ""What would million dollars? Two chicks time!"" have. Manager? forgot people immortal covid. Demogorgon? 😜 Vaccines thing. Even vaccine able offer 3 months protection - would make shortest-lasting vaccine history - we'll still able handle it. We'll produce faster, get everyone vaccinated every 3 months. 

But even needed. vaccine lasts 3 months, vaccinate majority population within 2 months (targeting likely spread it) - job's done. 

We produce far, FAR enough oxycotin country everyone one pill per month (probably enough least one pill per week, honestly); absolutely make medical product everyone take every months. pre-empt, yes know pills vaccines, shit, example make medical products massive quantities. trust numbers though? saying sarcastically point view beliefs wrong. Fucking AGAIN. speaking manner meaning don’t believe like think numbers fake hospitals making bank faking deaths. /s denotes this.
Of fucking course know hospitals billing COVID related deaths. think writing kindness hearts-absolutely not. Darwin hope lot states don’t it. would beyond devastating everyone. 


Florida handled 10k cases day weeks without lockdown. They’re proving handle virus better NY without lockdown. happening UK. tested positive recovered died later due circumstances, still reported Covid death. news lot recently government looking deaths recorded/reported. everyone saying Joe Rogan, dumb af. suspect ""first finish line"" vaccine gets approved demonstrates works going Oxford vaccine (most proven technique plus head start)... Lol you’re really comparing respiratory virus bacterial disease spread infected fleas? honestly think daft comparison apt? Jesus christ like windows updates 33% worst days early on, fear?

Wear mask close public proximity coming up. Quarantine test socializing freely. Tip delivery guy. Guess I'm going Ohio

&amp;#x200B;

""The cities identified Baltimore, Cleveland, Columbus, Indianapolis, Las Vegas, Miami, Minneapolis, Nashville, New Orleans, Pittsburgh St. Louis."" There's also tests CFR could lower due  reductions deaths things like car accidents. Yale published study estimating 2x higher. 1 tragedy, 1k statistic, 145k sad reality  Ironically Vietnam prime minister make order ""fight virus like fighting real enemy"" mobilize army, resources help control border, sanitizing locations find positive patients use military infrastructures base 14 days mandatory quarantine. since late April now, aside growing unemployment rate workers class due world economic go inevitable, thing go back normal.  think actually second round already, probably see results August. Third round like October think, know that's official, secondhand gossip contact IU public health folks. PLEASE another HCQ stockpile SNAFU........

(we stockpiled bunch medicine little anything help. general handling ""federal stockpile"" weird best corrupt worst. Jard Kushner seems think ""Federal stockpile"" = Trump family private reserve) Fucking hell that's nuts. Can't adequately explain dystopian far-fetched sounds me. I've grown assumption developed, functioning society government responsible healthcare, immediate thought ""But someone dies alcohol poisoning get picked up, someone would held accountable"". shit would never fly here. anything goes bad healthcare national outrage official inquiry etc. forgot /s Nancy worth 120 million 🤔🤔 Leaving inevitably delaying problem less ability fix it, understand sentiment. Right? Also Trump handled thing remote competence he’d surely re-elected. good luck talking sense conspiracy theorists. Same, can't afford shit Sounds like ol' defecation investigation situation stipulation. invade virus, works good heard i’ll say everyone know gotten far, every single one recovered fully back normal Absolutely nothing consequence happen. goalposts never moved. always ""conservatives deserve power. Liberals not."" That's logical conclusion. That's starting point. Guys act tough. take chances. think people realize fighting evolution. society species growing new limbs per say, clear conscious evolution happened last 20 years so. humans still fighting this, old type human, eventually species human old ways thoughts thinking die out, new human new conscious born. clear battle going evolution change, old always die higher conscious always prevails............Also Pineapple Trainwreck Daze apparently really daaaaamn good.. This. God willed be.  Nothing edgier drum circle  Yea Delta always solid. I've flown SWA twice recently, everyone wearing mask. Good see everyone head completely ass. tamp doomposting bit, deaths up, likely even increase here, think ever reach Northeast levels we're much better treating disease now.

Intubation done far often then, steroids avoided fear they'd make worse. turns intubation last resort, steroids possibly effective treatment now. 

We getting closer even better treatments, too. We're woods yet, course, recent months shown medical interventions make significant difference course disease. completely uninformed simply delusional that's really, truly think. actual problem. think know better him? I'm sure asked everywhere could. can't measure reaction death toll. world trade center towers, icon capitalism American supremacy, obliterated militant group. seriously doubt reaction would different even buildings fully evacuated planes innocents board. hunt Osama bin Laden destruction Taliban overreaction. twisting narrative diplomatic interests Iraq war even reaction required false narrative WMD's. told it’s “only old sick people”. Even that’s case, what?!? value? Weird considering GAVI vaccine alliance Microsoft partner lists microchipping babies birth 2030 part objectives. pandemic made lot things painfully clear one americans practically treat us like state

it's absolutely fucking infuriating PhD chemE biotech background.

The human immune system response extremely complex; many first line defenses immune system response circulating Abs needed. Many people infected with, beat, coronavirus developing Abs.

The first 10-12 pages article Prof. Iwasaki @ Yale Med great basic understanding layers immune system author article put video watched everyone trying follow COVID-19 twitter feed also great...

This article call alarm... almost everyone jumping peer review right interest getting data out. tell you, experience, peer review process generally adds little quality article, unless article going high impact journal (e.g. Science, Nature, PNAS, etc.).  Make 198. lost cousin today.

Take seriously, people!  Exactly Fair enough. may injecting much personal bias since friend mine walked job grocery store filed citing gastritis risk factor approved without question.  Really shows close idiocracy are. I’m sure it’s highlight year 😂

Keep winning social media, bud!

My 4 upvotes downvote I’m sure it’s hard counting Mom’s basement shave neckbeard. 6 times worse flu spite extreme measures we've taken COVID prevent healthcare systems getting overrun. That's maybe bit dramatic. likely we'll see tweet transgender black people, something like that. money coming from? would paying why? I’m confused, see “All Deaths involving COVID-19” lower week. Significantly. someone explain deaths COVID-19 lower 1,000 week ending I’m going stay hopeful vaccinate enough vulnerable front line workers semi close normal winter sort thing prepare fronts hopefully sort thing planned now

Edit: semi close normal Wait. way?
/s almost finished setting new one near workplace, looking forward opening snacks trinkets, guess that's happening soon :(  set spare table roomba wireless mouse attached lolol mean states admitted that. Florida got caught last week week before. touting 2 men twenties died covid. interviewer asked comorbidities. rep dept health stated didnt know one men comorbidities died motorcycle accident. 

A friend coworker sister die massive heart attack listed covid death. Thing is, many people stupid stuff time Texas, impossible trace spike single set dates events. like trying blame one car speeding highway half cars also speeding well. 
 
Also, Dum Texas, we're alone. Oklahoma's even worse (maybe 20-30% mask usage vs 40-50% Texas), many states equally playing Dum game. Well sure. way stand profit telling insurance company robbed things never owned.
 
Both things crime. thing thing reduce unemployment benefits people get work!   
C’mon teachers!

/s world's ending, y'all better bugout rig ready!

/s feel like wear mask enter Dollar Tree even corona. think emphasis “for us”. am? Pretty much. I’ve seen 2 people without mask stores since Friday. I’ve 5 different stores busy. 

Like don’t understand you’re trying argue. said legitimate pre symptomatic spreading dangerous. also virus tend mutate less lethal (they spread less lethal it’s beneficial virus mutate less lethal strain) one might (no benefit mutation). fair, don’t really even know mutated one way another many reasons one place could higher mortality rate another. 

However, people follow public health guidelines yes, higher lower mortality strain would spread rate stay home we’re sick. wear masks spread decreases further. 

And none accounts fact covid seems build slowly takes weeks get bad. time person lethal strain could still spreading go feeling sick said do. no, don’t agree virus would easily mutate one way another based logic.

There case infected worker wore masks. didn’t spread single client. yes, masks work. I’m assuming important glory holes? Check latest Texas case/death second chart mountain-side, 7-day average death change. surprise guess given we're hearing.

Also, here's national map COVID death hotspots today, measured per-capita Arizona + Confederacy getting hammered. antibody test last week blood drive. Dr. Fauci testifying even change opinions?

I think US mostly set ideologies beliefs, unless someone close suffered permanent damage death...

 Even still believe think ""I'm different, I'm strong healthy"" despite 20kgs overweight I’m sorry. 😔 want nit picky fine - get money death covid patient higher reimbursement certain treatments covid diagnosis. need procedure send claim. people dying covid hospitals bed charges (which triggered upon admission) ventilator charges, would pretty quick &amp; easy investigation. add numbers variable schools opening up. telling he’s real doctor? help Elon Musk also broadcasted theory everyone. We’re over-developed. fucked #sorry better applies people nose Bingo tested? Yes, that’s it’s time pump taxes hospitals. Covid deaths = GDP. /s India mostly one specific race, America not. Deleted comment? Coward. I'm sorry wasn't. feel like I'm trying split atom sometimes many cases (I feel place successful we're always bloodthirsty stuff). goals provoke healthy discussion difficult things. heard people go feelings, going go much else need careful throwing stats stuff like that. 

I feel bad loss, well. lose anyone illness. dumb. bad, thought India (*_*) fit people get trouble - don’t notice O2 levels dropping continue exercising, using little oxygen have. read marathoner keeling dead run - Covid positive. hard hit area, get oximeter monitor saturation exercise.   rough reference, approximate 7-day moving avg cases deaths dates:

7/22 - 75,564 cases 874 deaths

7/15 - 72,245 cases 812 deaths

7/8 - 39,199 cases 496 deaths

7/1 - 40,666 cases 860 deaths

6/22 - 22,945 cases 497 deaths

So look back week, like OK...~870 deaths/day coming ~72k cases/day found 7/8-7/15

But time case death longer, like around month, deaths we're seeing today actually cases detected mid-June 7-14 days ago....yeah August looking good. Could headed towards 2k/day. Still pretty bold statement say never put based really mean anything. 9000 engineers signed letter claiming 9/11 happened plane running it. another 3000 scientists signed letter claiming global climate change manmade. Hey man that’s great you. it’s great doesn’t mean doesn’t suck others. I’m also privileged America, definitely see government failing significant amount population really don’t know either. But, one thing throw thought process...cultural norms around physical contact. differences even within Scandinavian countries...and start talking Iran, Italy, etc. 

Oh boy...from hear Iranians wear mask day pull kiss cheeks hugging. 

Perhaps Sweden somewhat culturally social distancing countries default?

Also, I’d interested see nursing home stats. example states (Massachusetts comes mind, think non-NYC New York numbers maybe well) death rate/death toll vicious initially tailed bit. Massachusetts nursing homes absolutely ripped them. 

Could vulnerable died early on?...and low-hanging fruit picked? hate talk human lives way seems possible. mean funny laughing US hitting head I'm getting concerned. ketchup chips? Also liking Hockey get bonus points? I'm conspiracy theorist realization. Lockdown decimates retailers helps Amazon. Bezos added billions net worth this. comes back select run world us peasants suffer. Well mean, % still low. I'm one idiots, that's might say. LA first Wait, know therapy?! kind business this? mean live top one another, feces poorly ventilated caves. love guns too, I'd trade little bit sanity, rationalism, compassion, clarity right now. Well, except hunting rifle. Need one food. Heck, I'll trade use bow. That’s people now. Last week ‘nobody dying’. week it’s ‘death part life’ wasn’t supposed permanent solution...then Government failed addressing public health crisis epic dumpster fire.

Now it’s job come viable solution general population. 

You screw pooch must pay piper. get Medicare patients. deaths. article cited say deaths. mean, two groups people mean death rate. Obviously uniformly applied statistic aggregate measure. Never. fisticuffs broken brain another tally mark side wiping ass constitution. Division sucks, point lot comfortable destroying lot great *Our* country guise ""Law Order"". 

If figured administration DOJ looting burning MUCH worse poor people causing unrest, worth effort. Again...

I wish would wake up. depends country talking entering second wave...
 internal politics, social aspects cultures, world events climate seasons date needs take account make prediction. globally entering second wave, data pretty obvious increase lot more.

About second question, think US India break daily 100k cases, Brazil doubt, government tries much hide cases half country ceased first wave, numbers still hundreds every state, better thousand cases daily. relax much, see second wave lockdown (The whole country big lockdown, regional/municipal scale) Sweden hopefully put nail coffin opening pandemic. 

But afraid US going take grand prize killing people reason. Mississippi latest state start spiking looks like going crawl states 3 4 time. 

Stay safe whole state Texas neighboring states ICU beds spare us,"" Dr. Vazquez said.

Well, straight false believe it’s modeled Narcissist’s Prayer info month behind... “I think you’re terrible reporter” - DJT Indiana? way! /s think extended social interaction would like, location phone place interaction could occur set period time. 

So looked data map saw, hmmm, 100 phones location bar least hour, would extended social interaction. 

Or even like, residential address 25 phones 1-3 hours probably house party. People willingly lining get nose swobbed dna sent CDC. 
Most cel phones contact tracing automatically turned on. 

Covid real kills people. government definitely happy use situation destroy rights waiting outstandingly ignorant Governor. Thank say employee-perceived risk, says risk. says ""and"" that, susceptible population part applies actual risk requirement. they're going require documentation conditions. kind restrictive, lot leeway. Remember seeing really trippy doc that. Can’t remember life called though don’t think you’re correct either. researched flu IFR pretty extensively months ago came several conclusions (based memory, might inaccuracies):

1.	The CDC flu stats suggest 0.1% death rate backed great science. Lots extrapolation estimation based small studies.
2.	In estimates err side exaggerating flu deaths public takes seriously. 
3.	That rate isn’t CFR IFR, it’s death rate among people who, put simply can, symptomatic enough disease burden others (like missing work using healthcare resources)
4.	To get IFR that, you’d need know asymptomatic minor-symptomatic rate flu. one idea, it’s estimated something like 20-70%.

All all, even close apples apples comparison CDC estimate flu serology-based IFRs Covid. IFR flu, using methodology we’ve seen give 0.5-1% Covid, almost certainly less 0.1%. every country around world? convince that? Yea, we'll ship you. Oh wait, there's import tax. Oh well, we'll ship every country first then. Lots eating without masks. clearly care life, stupid Texans Watching news tonight 16 hour shift hospital I'm teachers saying they're beyond ready go back work shows director CDC claiming schools perfectly safe....fuck country.

Many schools underfunded understaffed. many pay lipservice say routinely cleaning? part?   would think minimum could theoretically bit lower new treatment regimens continuing evolve become effective current cohort younger  Lucky Oxford vaccine development since 5 years ago similar virus, it’s safety ensured corners cut.

I'm sure people reinfected. we're going hear dozens hundreds cases. sound really scary still tiny fraction population something really need worry about. really wish fallen line masks back February. course that, Trump would trying discredit something else.

What Fauci said technically accurate - lot conflicting information time. first SARS outbreak, countries without adequate PPE began giving cloth masks health care workers infection rate health care workers *increased*. However, lot mitigating circumstances. Science extremely complex nuanced, court popular opinion people expect things black white.

Of course, saying otherwise would gone Surgeon General's idiotic public statements masks. Dr. Adams Trump pawn political appointee, physician administrative level employ federal government, never ever break ranks SG. Fauci *had* gone Adams' public statements told people wear masks, would job currently - mention would created even confusion federal doctors making conflicting statements.

Sickens see Trump throws Fauci bus every chance gets, Fauci made statement choice Trump knows it. funneling public funds already well off? okay? Beleving india usa. He's pushing buttons day without clue do. Forty percent patients ICU COVID-19, 30% one week ago. Dr. Dobbs warned Texas, Louisiana Florida grabbing bulk resources, Crisis Care hard decisions made. includes determining lives dies. Everywhere I've seen estimated death rate lower 1%.

I’m glad got figured sake. Berks bad, rural Lancaster.
There’s Grade stupid water supply. get know CEO well get symptoms. things change really quick. Consider cost lost lives, lost jobs, lost businesses, trillions added national debt vs cost national mask policy.

There’s solid shot we’ll vaccine mass production end year, early next year latest. personally hold going large group activity then. others want risk lives go football game can’t stop them, don’t see smart decision. I'm confused-- Republicans primarily backed grandmas grandpas? ultimate traitor. No- June would tune playing out....that’s game going ruined it! mean developed country. government that's regressing decades. people stopped eating propaganda stopped supporting anti-intellectualism, could actually good shape. I've thought leaving. one wants us there. masters degree, might help, probably English speaking countries that's know. one wants us right corona. wear pants all? drawer full baggy basketball shorts. get cheeky actually get money going get fact-checked person people make claim wrong.

There's evidence fraud happening though actual counter-point make. can't say incentive commit fraud, fraud happening. need evidence none. pretending get extra money nothing argument . Uh, non conservative here, sides fucked Healthcare system shreds. systemic problem. blame politicians problem we're in. Umm treatment yes deaths. read?  Hospitals get additional funding covid patients. miss it, short line Creed. Similar whomever debate. thought talking pic Fauci lol ge looks pretty sinister pic well   issue flu vaccine designed last year's flu strains previous flus. vaccine specifically specific virus. know exactly target results show antibody TCell production higher actually got it. flu strain change every year would way effective. silly comparison. Mine Democrat basically Republican light  I'm wild daily testing anyone POTUS NFL players still sick exposed people can't get tested, get results back several weeks. Yup quite thin line one day wake find side  upvote go nowadays anyway. Anyway thanks taking time answer. Stay healthy ""The government probably paid people die control numbers! ploy control us rip us human rights!"" bet there's midnight calls Daddy Trump going on. Pray harder! Nah way much press it(obviously) vaccine cheap. drugs associated covids long term effects, worse insulin. 1. people know would rather die economy though
2. can’t catch cancer someone else
3. amount people dying cancer spreading increasing daily read fully. flippant remark implied unreliability doubt. that’s message wanted convey blame bad words. Also, didn’t vote you, though reply pretty passive aggressive I’ve thought otherwise now.  Yeah acktually, 1,000 still less half April.

Edit: apparently need put /s obvious 😔 Move goal posts. That's got. June 2nd me, first time quitting missed it. Sounds dumb say Yippee, I'm Non Smoker! Alan Carr Stop Smoking Easy Way. whole time reading book (while smoking) thinking ""this shit dumb, never work"" has! 

I started smoking 16, 34 now. past 6ish years, I've quit I'd always take back convinced could sometimes smoker I'd buy 1-2 packs month. past 6 months smoking every day. 

Heard book bunch times. available library almost buy usually spend money books... realized dumb 7 bucks could stop spending 10-12 per pack... hard enough get people take flu vaccine shit around forever utter bullshit. Hey now! two cellphones 3 microphones, 3 cameras sides, scans face, uses fingerprints... could go wrong?!?! thing. don’t turn gay eating restaurant serves gay people. Shame Republican Party! We've always war Eastfauci. Well obviously Rapture glad them. Atheist something? people insist upon touching fire learn first hand burns. Unfortunately them, burns survivable. first hand knowledge every coronavirus case? I’m debating disagree it’s waste time. They've like since beginning. I’m really glad hear that. I’d sure love hear son’s thoughts actions. 45 get McDonalds now? Exactly. I’ll glad there’s vaccine!  big city, drive around hospitals look refrigerated trailers show them. Especially state media ÖR, Deutsche Welle.  RemindMe! August 30 ""sigh, another one these"" None. dont use lightbulbs use LED cause efficient :) Communism win.

And throw caution wind 200+ guests late, Canada. Hello mandatory isolation! unfortunate truth. damage Trump’s wake long half life. Except President Camacho put smart guy charge fixing problem.

Brando, got plants crave. Nurses dealing directly covid patients wear hazmat suits, generally wear n95 higher, goggles something eyes, gloves gown, obviously almost cases coming airborne droplet/aerosol spread inhaled. Nothing stepping hospital makes n95s p100 work work public, got them, use certainly provide better protection piece fabric Chinese made surgical 1 cent mask mostly stop coughing people. also violently dragged plane?   completely agree gets much credit. least let health minister handle case really interfere negative way. 
Still, gets lot credit much work also done people Lmao stuff France. ""I think government, they're trying f.. Us"".

Are stupid? Like economic shutdown good government get money taxes? Make glory holes great again!  Hospitals set separate areas/buildings large percentage medicare/medicaid patients transferred main building. 

They ""refer"" patients particular attending oversees large amount medical students, care would performed. area often older equipment, larger wait times, older medications, basically whatever left main building. also sounds like downplaying deathrate really know expect. hopefully see another NYC knows several states hit hard simultaneously resources potentially running thin look like. 

Not mention many people/leaders states mentioned already taking virus seriously. Telling might deadly counterprductive convinced masks stupid. People often refuse use condoms advice health officials, I’m sure expect people lol It’s technically possible. It’s done successfully
In several countries.

But, no. US going to. Worked hard right here! that's correct denomination dumbasses. antibody test detect cronoviruses though? that's important know. They’re gross canadians like them. occasionally find available US since it’s disgusting doesn’t sell well. Johnny's basement mixing medicine. don’t enough ICU beds even pandemic. prepared. 


Gov. Tater done got confused. enough ICU beds “prepared”.


PS- I’ve grown Mississippi currently live here. I’ve driven two family reunions, complete bouncy house water slides, last 14 days. mArK bEaSt! REEEE! Well done review. perfect compared USA Brasil, danger Covid identified quick enough total breakout. 

In hindsight, could/should 2-4 weeks earlier, better coordinated states rules throughout every state however, german way 16 versions laws regulations is. 

And despite states (Sachen, NRW) pushing fast reopenings due political motivations state reps (NRW Minister wants run Bundeskanzler next year) went well overwhelming part public managed accept wearing piece fabric buying grocceries end world.

Still, lot businesses crumbling, especially artists people working field slowly bruning savings start close. cultural drought, ever get's fixed vaccine. matter, friends parents wear masks continue go they're neighbor died Aunt uncle contracted it. They're extreme denial.  think that's okay? lots beer, I’m getting tested 5 hours. Pretty nervous since getting cold last fee days fever. worst thing US saw coming. us Europe time - absolute evidence - get ready it. delay virus spread across pond could lifesaver America. doubled making political fight.

I hope politicians people finally understand situation. Better late ever. Since can't exhale well CO2 slowly builds triggers thinking suffocating. 

You poor opinion human body ability regulate things like CO2 levels. body badly put together none us would see first birthday.

Your autonomic system causes breathe needed keep CO2 levels stabilized. mask adds 1% difficulty breathing, muscles work 1% harder. mountain 20% harder breathe, notice it, people still breathe.

It happens automatically without knowledge, minor things like masks, major things like planes high altitudes. Who? It’s still relevant points __U.S. health officials already knew asymptomatic transmission *late January*__, rather 2 months later finally reversed stance masks April based “new findings.” understand US, understand it. Yeah US claims 1st world country. Brazil 7th world country best. mentality Brazil ‘If don’t go work covid, can’t eat die. go work covid, die too’ Abe supporting Go Travel campaign eagerly? dire situation? honestly, stupid enough go party realize gravity current situation, think also stupid enough simply shrug everything else care much. without chip anyone track movement... (Sent phone) guys going halloween? Meduza’s calculations, Moscow see spike coronavirus cases month June

What base calculation on? reported deaths statistics reflect reality either single day deaths several different dates reported reported huge lag (for instance, recently adding people died May). Ya that's fear. complicated think fair speak Anglos way, think would complicated explain system Rundfunkräte.
Also see term state media negatively connotated. functioning democracy think fair assume state media independent whims politicians.

Basically second best outcome would immune system least remembers Covid-19 blueprint antibodies filed.


As soon get infected, production antibodies starts. nothing struggling breathe.

I support wearing masks, since best way minimize pandemic without going total lockdown. fact sometimes really make difficult breathe. Lying someone experiences struggling breathe never happened going actually convince wear mask. like haggle fucking profiteers every penny put building perks. use wmds gas people? Like, that's well known?   yet sub still thinks talk covid mention certain political party’s role it. Let's get together. Actually since people power using excuse funnel money back hands millionaires billionaires, it’s crazy think there’s conspiracy going on. happens right wing outlets people getting news also run billionaires conspiring funnel money themselves.

The reality isn’t virus fake, reality rich using virus excuse make richer. 50ml dihydrogen monoxide 3 times per day provide better protection items list, go doctor today demand prescription suddenly lost grandfather stroke October. quite healthy aside 82. difficult loss it’s hard hear people experience virus.

It’s hidden effects like may partly explain many places significant covid outbreaks seen excess mortality beyond recorded covid deaths. Many people like grandfather died quickly stroke probably tested virus. 7k distancing, mask, various lockdown measures. Open wide 7k massively larger.  fact really deny that...wtf people We’re not, Murdoch media Facebook feeding idiots steady stream kind crap fair, course would deny it. Duh. information factual. feeling resistance exhaling, taking muscle work breath part apparently good shape. Need muh freedumb Merica live Japan. father America terminal brain cancer. would dangerous visit him, even could wouldn’t allowed back I’d lose job.

It really sucks. saw. came. contracted. weird pandemic never hit Japan hard, say I'm pretty skeptic numbers.

 China everything blew (24-25th January) fled Japan fear airports closing(Feb. 3rd), arrival thing asking Wuhan lately. Osaka/Kyoto/Tokyo ~20 days normal life lot tourists, wearing masks, many wearing them, packed subways, buses, touristic sites, clubs... seems impossible virus didnt propagate way Europe/America dead space lungs 5x mask, ""CO2 levels"" even really thing exhale all.

Remember, enough left O2 low enough CO2 breath exhale directly another persons lungs resuscitate them. ever feel like getting kinky someone, breath see many breaths takes need actually swap air. serious, answer 3. breath air 3 times, need couple breaths fresher air. small increase partial dead volume really make much difference.

The reason people feel like causing problems resistance exhaling, push air used it. all. CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THINKS. waĺls found? asking friend. Note ""news"", article April 2nd, nearly four months old. time see human beings gathered high density settings, get skeeved out. Whether Jake Paul's mansion, mega churches, crowded beaches, night clubs protests. Sometimes feel like I'm taking crazy pills assuming human beings walking biohazards need avoided. US messaging social distancing bad Trump administrations response pandemic. 👁👄👁👈🖕 fact anyone would believe blows mind. walk around cellphones pocket, alexa home, post hundreds pictures Facebook, Instagram, Twitter companies sell information. vaccine covid worry about? Wow. Wow... Wow. Fuck bill, wanted chip We've got brutal set irregular stairs opposite flat, half lazy shits. We've spent lockdown getting bit healthier. used struggle stairs. walked day change really hit me. Struggle improved problem. really shocked. put flu vaccine instead. 

Muahahahaha!

Edit: /s - seems wasn’t clear enough. Many doctors talking ""Big one"" decades. 

My best friend doctor, I'm mathematician, SARS hit 2003, read it. Scared shit me. Australia skipped SARS, H1N1. Melbourne currently beginning wave 2(1.1?), might get control.

If speak anyone high government security Western country, know pandemics much bigger threat almost anything else. viruses invisible, funding goes things big visible ...  Exactly thoughts! I've seen posts show tweets saying coronavirus political hoax US. Lol. line thinking....even possible? 

They tweeting, must internet...right? impossible know covid actually exists countries also. Internet surely tell literally every country fucked - US, even possible consider fact maybe, MAYBE DISEASE ACTUALLY SPREADING WORLD? know 12 hours later maaaad stupid. mortality rate influenza 0.1%. current mortality rate Covid-19 4.1% worldwide 3.6% inn US. 36 41 times deadly flu. 6. PNW checking see Dollar Tree's small rural towns place. confirm morons also active Australia New Zealand. 
Masks mandatory Melbourne (where people going work sick spreading shit further) number faux celebs influencers stating refuse comply growing. I’m Italian quarantined since March 10 may 15 recall correctly

I don’t know anyone died, don’t even know anyone COVID still use mask outside wash hands many many times day similar

It excuse allocate subpar services Medicaid Medicare recipients violates program participation agreements. Hospitals physicians willing jeopardize ability participate programs guaranteed revenue generators - foundation castle built, speak. Honestly, gone 2 bottles fine probably nothing worry about. 

Seems precautionary possibly made factory. reason people think NY competent government Gov. Cuomo plays cameras well. important objective measure - deaths - utter failure. blunders well documented, refusing quarantine New York, refusing shut early, sending symptomatic elderly Covid patients back care homes. last week people died 911. India never communist shithole like lefties want be. fAciSm lmao

Coronavirus not. Smashin’ records baby False list ‘home treatments’, list false ‘home treatments’ ? 

Cuz things quite different. Alas, death severe effect, people steered live, expect see huge rise chronic problems caused this, live-shortening themselves. insane thing aside entitlement, registered nurse. know rules place. still can't get ego.  covid too. democratic trying seize power Austria? need afraid? scale thermal screening going reduce number people running fever given space. Fewer people fevers, fewer people actively shedding virus (COVID-19 other), lower viral load, reduced rate infection. 10 infected people Walmart infect fewer people 20. scale matter can't catch asymptomatic cases, catching even half symptomatic ones slows spread. course false positives part that, means go mall worst go fever clinic quick test gets done day. least he's trying improve life wish good luck. No! Shortime growth longtime gain. know capitalism?? Americans said China Italy.  That’s LUL Yeah, read lot brother US. 
That also reason follow news much. 
The American Dream dead exposed lie sold lower middle class get line. government displayed complete disregard people supposed serve. republicans shown idiots, bullies warmongers, democrats sing song ""turn cheek"", over, sacrificing little man. police - even begin...
Watching sidelines, 
it tragedy regular people. met really good guys girls US, really hope make without civil war. 
At point, see - keep surviving, cast vote hope best.  Maybe one thinking of, everything confusing right hahaha. seems like lot things went well Germany. followed countries done realized happened China Italy. knew hospitals overwhelmed problem built extra ICU facilities provided mental health surfaces hard hit areas. followed China, Taiwan, South Korea using contact tracing apps, creating efficient testing, push leadership make scientific decisions.

As regular citizen, take COVID-19 seriously March. kind brushed thought would stay mostly Asia, felt comfortable since at-risk category, believed US would able handle virus started enter US. mind set started shift gave thought: ""who infect"" ""what long-term side effects"". ability communicate things key stopping spread keeping people well-informed. think public health officials, government scientist, leadership need step get citizens grounded.  But...but would go hot bartenders beer Sunday? weird cases keep exploding across south. like people careless something.  did. Best decision life. Meanwhile, Federal Troops sent Democratic led cities. Well done America. Land free. Sinovac, China based pharma vaccine works, Moderna Oxford, perhaps part it? They're also scheduled start human trials Brazil South Africa already. one top three candidates first, maybe good idea seeing Moderna U.S. Operation Warp Speed already gave AstraZeneca billion. Sinovac could obvious alternative choice. Thousands dumbass still gathering portland, wear mask removing talk eatchother... America trully special place... Yet many unhealthy areas country much changed obesity-wise 30 years.

We change anything. surprise can't even wear masks. worst part correction could apply equally ""Republicans"" ""mankind"", cannot tell meant. feels inside US too. 

How many us see reality? Reddit really likes armchair epidemiologist 20/20 hindsight 

What public health background saying exact thing since beginning? second round antibody/testing survey probably within like month. I've actually seen bit data, can't remember results. yeah, course higher course like years away herd immunity. Man it’s bad city. haven’t single case Covid speculation amongst people wild. Majority cities people wear mask least. places made exceptions face mask rule people medical conditions include asthma, also reports health organizations say *can* potentially harmful people conditions *severe asthma* wear mask, honestly time argue lot people. Face shields may less effective, they're better nothing. mention nothing $500 Billion smash n grab vanish corporate pockets friendly Trump quid pro quos attached them. !remind 2 months Sweden *is* country. ""I'm tired wearing condom. can't see HIV, flu right???"" Several countries successfully eradicate it. possible, ship sailed It’ll probably escalation, trump probably come call xi dumbass something ""My ____ died car crash said ~~covid~~ stroke"" even register, somehow political. logic equivalent unable multitask? Keep Dammit guessed Florida, clicking link. Damn TX even dumber FL. Everyone falling line Surgeon General. work *anywhere* federal public health system, matter part PHSC not, **you fall line SG**.

The SG political appointee, seen chips fall many Trump fall-guys reputation blowing wind. 

* Trump says people wearing masks indictment him, SG stays course public statements telling people ""“They effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus"".

* Trump claims hydroxychloroquine cures coronavirus, surgeon general pressures FDA emergency approval makes standard protocol federal hospitals state hospitals federal funding.

* Trump says virus ""go away Easter"" SG ignores overwhelming body medical knowledge says so.

* Trump says tests mean cases, goes along - despite fact MPH he's *at least* one semester epidemiology knows value random testing.

He knew community spread. knew likely airborne. knew common knowledge environmental health also common sense - filtering aerosols always *some* reduction spread *any* respiratory disease. public figure one important jobs making official public statements - made definitive public statement knew untrue wanted fall line behind Trump. 

There plenty blame among agencies, CDC smaller agency HHS (which headed former big pharma lobbyist Alex Azar btw) direct advisory SG. Trump clearly setting lower agencies fall guys - NIH CDC - shielding cronies blame clearly deserve. Looks like Sturgeon mask think states different countries like Europe, quite locked down. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), can’t even want. Immigration Canada pandemic already, hard, it’s basically impossible. Canada keeps extending travel ban Americans, likely won’t change long while. cool sound byte, real mechanism even darker. 

The S&amp;P, people reference “the market” saying “the market x% today”, weighted index. 

It’s “decoupled reality” all, it’s index carried tiny percentage companies well (FAANG stocks mostly). 

So, look 500 companies S&amp;P, too. 

It’s “the market” decoupled. It’s society’s stand “the market”, index itself, foolishly weighted obscures damage present... even companies within 

But since people don’t look companies index, assume stocks decoupled reality. When, I’m reality, S&amp;P bad index look times like even stock market agrees we’re fucked.  New Zealand North Korea good job too. PPP loans attempt Feds. States **could** increased UI limits $600+, know state $3b surplus cutting benefits years back. instead, kept paltry $350 (if could even apply broken system 7hr+ wait times phone).

Meanwhile state UI apply 1099 gig workers, Feds stepped something PUA. Again, something state could done passing law, anywhere. Back point, could apply PUA state's (likely broken) UI system.

State stockpiles PPE things **their** responsibility, relying FEMA step time crisis. basically made rash decisions zero preparation handling situation domain.

If saying true, abolish pretty much reliance state anything go entirely federal. states fucked up, continue fuck every corner.

Why nursing homes complete disaster? That's also feds fault somehow? Despite giving guidelines states follow? put children danger

I understand that's narrative. ""Putting children danger"". Sure, would bad enough.

But little darlings live rocks! swarm every morning, mingle bring goods home mommy, daddy, siblings grandparents everyone else encounter.

By sending kids school, EVERYONE danger, WAY right now. numbers surging like crazy.

Give time: One two weeks schools reopen + two weeks getting test results (I read that's long takes US) = whole month uncontrolled spreading. think really bad rn, wait little... I'm boat. infuriating. Sometimes can’t believe “one fifth Americans can’t locate US map” statistic, see comment like one above... act terrorism treated such. would like bring awareness places problems getting attention needed. South Carolina Department Corrections Covid-19 broke massive outbreak shortly after. Inmates receiving commissary means ability purchase soap sanitary needed avoid virus. Also shortage cleaning supplies state necessities like food employees. shortage causes inmates able come showers even communicate families. Reception Evaluation centers come cell 3 times week miss day catastrophic. Inmates flooding units starting fires draw attention nothing done. inmates centers 6-7 months getting come cell less hour week. offenders even minor driving charges also housed 3 inmates per cell. Even though convicted criminals still fellow humans rights. Please help bring awareness wrong people National Crisis treated behind bars. Thank time. (I also one inmates diagnosed Covid-19 willing answer questions might means licensed medical physician.) Part God's plan, nobody could've seen coming! that's ""ocassional hotspots appearing every while"" example. Also, infectious early stages infection. people around caught it, chances least show symptoms - they'd let know maybe caught caught you. Either way quarantined while, quarantined someone known case (either symptoms, tested confirmed asymptomatic) stay quarantine they're better. 

So, two weeks thing really well handle it, lot likely catch day 1 someone locked day 13. 4-degrees-of-separation thing going keeps infection fresh virulent someone ends. hospitals facing financial shortfalls shifts care needed effectively manage pandemic Funny mention Applebee's, went past local one day could count customers one hand. Normally quarter 8 evening parking lot would packed. ...have asked around? US handled badly, Americans did. Major difference. lot people continue die flu every year. happen covid. *Jesus.*

Sorry, no, that's I'm saying. honestly can't believe still understand this. 

I'm debating ""treatment"" vs. ""death"" whatever. Whatever discussion is, I'm part getting nuance sarcastically parroting idiots saying

I literally **just** said sarcastically implying conspiracy theorists think hospitals earn money listing deaths COVID-19. said along conspiracy theories crisis actors stuff like that. 

So, clearly understand you. know sarcastic. know really believe that. know saying idiots saying. beliefs. know. 

I've said half dozen times.

Please, let go.

**I'm going put clearest language possibly can.**

You hospitals get money list death COVID don’t know? also NY footage paid actors freezer trucks empty want us sheep wear masks. conditioned track us tracers inoculations. Bill Gates entire world take away American freedoms. /s

You sarcastic there, right? Essentially, saying ""That's crazy conspiracy theorists believe,"" right? joke, making fun conspiracy theorists (again, I'm saying know understand it).

Everybody understands that.

Here's one thing I'm arguing, **only** point I'm making:

Your first sentence, billing, mixed sorts sarcastic, crazy conspiracy stuff. first sentence true. conspiracy.

That's it. That's whole point. yeah, later walked back, saying ""Umm treatment yes deaths. read?"" But, that's meaningless distinction. 

That's it. 

I'm done this. can't possibly make point clearer simpler that. understand I'm saying, discussion pointless. You’re pretty dense think didnt kind lockdown states. 1000 day keeps Dr. Fauci away Serum institute?

Edit: Nevermind, read article. Sorry. /r/conspiracy people sure worldwide plot Trump. works pharmacy tells every week two customer died. Yeah didnt read article, claimed sentence didnt exist, total dick. Piss now, wrong.  ghost Lehman Brothers enters chat. I'm thin, healthy 30 year old life long asthma. could die everybody hears could like, ""well yeah asthma.""

Really makes comfortable knowing keel nobody give shit.  many people Covid kills even main problem. covid patients need ICU care exist vacuum. accident, heart attack etc treated hospitals overburdened doctors - one time you. people wanted wear already were. didn’t want wear one don’t to? what’s fucking point? disagree strongly policy. People right travel maskless, offered place likeminded passengers specially designated area, aircraft's wings. Americans* like someone Europe China ..  know Todd Atkin apologized comment year? also later took back apology doubled book wrote years later political career never recovered. hope sterilization. Well need wait much longer. first confirmed Covid Case US January 20th. point states municipalities started planning would respond case outbreak. We've 7 months plan prepare moment failed so. never drove 85 think 45 fast.

120 years ago lucky get El Paso 3 weeks.

You'd travel less far better it.

And better trains.


During ww2 speed limits set 40 believe traffic deaths fell 32k 20k would likely dropped better implemented stuck with.

Since 1.5 million Americans died car crashes.

I assume road system good well implemented. assume came little thought hurt us planet many ways.


But anyway never get support opinions this. interesting seem care. faster, faster, faster..  what? courts precedent forcibly vaccinating people okay interest protecting public. growing evidence base behind masks, this'll stick legally, even people ignore it. tell us. Tell medical professionals Asia spreading misinformation. big yikeserinos sweetie pie

lets unpack pet support doggypupper medical examiners spend hours autopsies confirming COVID-19 deaths: ""Am joke you?""  There's reason named misery. Yep got dick mouth right speak.

Also I'm completely illiterate. use audio transcriber communicate social media  testing capacity exceeded probably see testing times rise well. easy fast testing infection rates low.  Cloth masks aren’t nearly leaky N95s, I’ve tested mine (it part earthquake emergency kit got years ago prevents inhalation dust smoke well respiratory droplets).

If place hand front face blow N95 feel breath spraying valve feel almost much I’m wearing mask. try thing cloth mask feel almost breath getting through. *like polls chart actual people lost lives* listened Joe Rogan/Oliver stone episode. 

He mentioned didn’t matter USA nuked Vietnam. would kept fighting end. formidable people. best one “Even get there’s 98% chance you’ll live cares?” Literally leave Xbox party job America

We're seeing 4th July partying brought us. shudder think 3 weeks opening schools bring. worry, lot people going act like fit ""no mask"" exemption criteria this. fact fit criteria gotten USA now.  medicines manufacturered here... Fun fact: live Germany example, you’d exactly that. You’d even allowed crossbows hunting, bows kinds crossbows legal own. (Not hunting, you’re 18 buy compound bow/crossbow could kill moose. It’s fine. nobody shoots random people either.) 

You get guns too, it’s lot harder get license extensive background checks regarding mental health others. 

But it’s going store even going online buying something hunt without anything prove you’re old enough, crossbows/bows.

And could creep dangerous parts town time, shot would one worries. Nobody needs gun don’t worry anyone else one either. It’s incredibly liberating feeling people idea default. 

Anyway wish guys best, hope make okay. predicting happen US hard, they're following trend 'and got worse' since 2016  quoting ONE quote qualifier. Every single part article says ""if"" ""could"" FACT remains there's evidence prove vaccines work.

Send peer reviewed study shows vaccines ineffective current strains I'll admit right HOWEVER, strain hit Milan, Italy originally fashion show visitors Wuhan, deadly strain spread quickly effectively. ways, COVID breaking rules. ways, like California strains began November/December, may following typical viral model rules.

Non variations COVID19 particularly deadly compared viruses. Since mild disease vast majority people infected problem spreading is. Dems blame trump know going lose 2020. be. fucked. OMGGGGG fucking shitty piece garbage human being. 😒 feel bad people living got infected. zero sympathy anyone home ends dying dumbass. That's her.

Only takes one idiot KNOWS they're infected (or thinks they're potentially infected) take precautions rest household paying price actions. CDC said everyone everything right. alll things perfect, 6-8 weeks something. 

this madness. understand country.

&amp;#x200B;

Signed,

*All countries.* Yeah. totally ignore thousands dying here. Could worse, right? think supposed wear mask balls. I’ll refer previous comment. mean Trump literally said people wear masks ""Trump haters"" masks work need another lockdown? social distancing works, need another lockdown? work even better need another lockdown? 

The claim probably “well didn’t wear masks right” 4 months people wearing masks “it late”. hurts true That’s true all. CDC explains here: glandular “No worries, deaths still low-ish.” wan't hank, Carl Moss; bobby's principal. Also, total number hospital beds available sets much lower ceiling hospitalisations total population sets cases. awful though. [Then shut compare VWAP bet would find interesting correlations 🤔 exactly. people incentive lie lose money spend tax dollars keep people lockdown. seem like timely home county (approx. 40k population). went 0 deaths July 9th 22 today.  losing ability tolerate stupidity took pride patience. news said ""90% teachers polled county say they're ready get back class, also mentioned 6% chose return work year"". paddle boarder arrested Thursday ignoring lifeguards’ orders get ocean near Malibu Pier despite beach closures amid coronavirus pandemic, authorities said. denied right visit sick relatives. Thousands elderly people died alone, families even say goodbye, coronavirus incredibly dangerous. People denied right go church, untold numbers businesses completely destroyed, coronavirus incredibly dangerous.

But toppling statues line dancing streets politicians clapping along fine, woke. Deaths still low hate bot sometimes.

To clarify, comment. He's allowed say pompeo country. Congressman Texas CNN today bragging flattened curve. shit not. 

timestamp: 6:30 I'm Penguins fan.

Been lurker snack exchange yet go one.  USA one lower mortality rates west, test 10x western nation sooooo catch meaning, could elaborate? ""I read one case one guy listed Covid car accident death, safely extrapolate 70% deaths fake""  Like I'd stay downvote meat grinder slandering Trump. karma precios stopping likes Barely lol. Companies apathetic something worse Covid spreads. Based covid projection site. NJ NY huge amount infections back March achieved level immunity spikes now. information correct Florida drastic decrease deaths early August. Texas late August early September. say tomorrow it’ll 1000.

And lying zigzag downwards straight curve. 

Seems dont understand trend line is, ignoring it.

How long wrong admit it?

And let things spiral control four months anything see happening right now?

Is death fetish? thought superbugs much worry anymore effectiveness [phage appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* months come plans set temporary wards squandered denying problem. Remember China built bunch temporary hospitals? worst congresscritters corrupt already wealthy, fucking salaries hurt all. 

Congresspeople get lifetime salaries stipulation never make independent stock trades work private sector ever again. srsly...I totally knew knowledge impacts pay attention. Exactly. Even Biden launches initiatives Day One, whole industries displaced wholesale domestic abroad depended consumerism methods won’t safe experience quite long time. “It’s 1/3 deaths 9/11 per day worries.” see, Democrats. doesn’t matter do, we’re allowed criticize them. even Cuomo killed thousands mandating COVID positive cases sent back nursing homes.

We’re allowed criticize Republicans. Make sense now? I've told multiple occasions couple Republicans. truth all? tf getting narrative from? both? tweeting announce war transgender blacks? care. killed uncle another person nursing home. I'm hoping like hell kill elders family. sad. 100% preventable.  Sure, people seem complaining wear mask walk around air conditioned costco 20 minutes. There’s risk there. Really? Every grocery store I've southern Ontario least one maple beverage. definitely great amount falsification happening numbers coming Russia. reasons, however, 'personal gain', keeping one's job such. undercounting, simply due usual chaos, centrally mandated. Provincial authorities others way coroners instructed report coronavirus death. Patients serious pre-existing medical problem, accounts majority die Covid 19, listed deceased disease, virus. imagine also hinges hospitals getting overwhelmed.  Florida won’t think Arizona someone tell flu kills more. Oh yeah remember thousands dying eeveryday flu like two hundred years ago. solution...

you see someone without mask, dont say word, manager calls police tells someone trespassing private business property. Police remove maskless moron saw ""no entry without mask"" ignored it. police's problem, job. maskless person tries fight pull gun on.police, well deserves coming him.


If walked store naked cops would called 100% There's actually lag death rates weeks. like get severely ill catch disease drop dead day. Could jumps next week so, already starting increase. trying spread doom gloom, I've noticed. Im aware hearing  work anymore? bot used instantly respond. RemindMe! August 30th safe open schools, children rarely die COVID.

Oh, yeah, good thing classes instructed 8-year-olds then. I'll admit, little on-the-fence hiring 4-year-old principal, clearly worked well case. I’ve gotten fat wear nice pants working tbh scientist, frustrated poorly prepared conclusions observations paper. Sample size 20. Likely frozen thawed samples. Probably RNA degradation. distinction made regard extraction method. lot molecular diagnostics based PCR (which suddenly people calling “shit” without even understanding probe-based PCR is). soul crying another molecular biologist come offer comments! realize sequencing also requires “shit” primers? really ""texans"" obviously meant it. something gives feeling quoted fellow californian expat. well, election coming up, reminding people good thing. Yea quit March smoking 10 years. Walking 7/11 citywide lockdown buy cigarettes pandemic respiratory virus? one ‘ok, time quit’ moments. don’t downvotes bud bet superintendent educated Florida. that's said want give press satisfaction wearing one? that's said individual? that's said they're effective? OK. Man hope US elections come soon rest world sick dying American politics. Fucking hell haha officially ignorant American thing I've ever seen like.. u aware world outside live? Like legit world man people jobs, families, hobbies whole shebang think would blow mind! Thanks governors. I’m NJ. They’ll get it. They’ll keep complaining eventually comply. Thankfully many national retail chains mandating well push compliance. Canadian, never heard putting Maple Syrup water coke, also really dislike hockey. feel bad Americans chosen current leader. can’t imagine hard must be. safe! hope safely visit Country one day.  Hey that's exponential winning  fucking crazy fox News one hell drug also literally telling people every news source lying they're ones truth brainwashing viewers  RemindMe! August 30 Oh ho ho. plenty Americans want shoot dirty yella people overseas stop virus. It’s case, said people nukes they’re gung ho going there. deaths attributed covid likely get federal aid resources allocated you. I'm pro gun that's principle liberties.

A lack gun control actually mean much technological advancements we've warfare public can't get hands on.

That said, give civil liberties gain elsewhere civil liberties gone reason listen anymore. confirm absolutely horrible. spoke gamer friend us. actually carry gun everywhere goes outside. Im Canada alien me. Like ok got keys got phone got gun. first sure he's policeman something.. . regular bloke cant go without gun. Thats insane. is. father quite narcissist. Yup, usually fogs first put certain cloth mask on, get situated, issue.   ""Hehe I'm danger"" Yes, I’m San Diegan still going work retail job customers still shop indoors for. It’s barely shut all, retail businesses strip mall open people stroll around indoors.

It’s shut way slapping bandaid amputation giving person medical treatment. used Sweden model instead. lockdown done little help. extent...they right.

Example Korea right daily cases 40-60 appears Govt pretty much decided ""That's going is""

However, Korean govt aggressively tracking cases down, lot contacts tracing lot measures place.

But 1,000+ daily dead 65,000+ daily cases? Yea can't live that. New Zealand Europe. testing better treatment methods. ifr .5-.8% per latest studies. hopefully drop better treatment methods come assuming don’t overwhelm hospitals exactly surprised anymore..? Ace *was* even worse. Nobody would wear one month ago.

Now ACE better mask compliance anywhere else. Goes show power owners/managers have. (Stupid Lowe's) qualified judge evidence. foreigner soon allowed website China decided past. would given evidence? article says tried (and probably failed like buildings things built China) gave article showing China reputation stealing course would continue steal. evidence steal? God, hate state much. Excuses excuses excuses. guess better learn live it. Bullshit. 

Businesses locked down. Pubs restaurants 90% businesses still open. think ""going work"" valid reason leave house? I'm work right every business street open fully staffed. Everywhere entertainment, restaurants personal services OPEN. need CLOSED like NZ. Everything closed bar supermarkets chemists. 80% transmission workplace, yet keep open. 

You want blame Murdoch give ALP pass idiocy kills people, keep killing get clue move stage four. whole problem eradicated six week stage four lockdown. Mafija don’t know anyone died house fire, house fires hoax  many nations done worse. awhile brazil test positivity rate close 50% almost million cases. India gave like did, months time crush everyone sheer size population density. ones want us dead unless we're lining pockets curbside Home Depot.

Home improvement stores crapfest entitled middle-aged ""you can't tell *ever*"" white guys -- give educated mask-abiding 30-something whites like -- bad name. Another clickbait headline. die 91 fuck Im lucky fuck considered average life expectancy 78. Thats wayyy average. Move goalposts little one gonna talk Nigerians killed ? ok know technology invented America right? iPhones, windows, reddit. know things. 9 month old baby died state week, amount people rationalized saying “children die every day” without sense sadness sympathy family breaks heart. New Zealand? yet sentiment embarrassingly large percentage actually living US hot zones one little concern mixed wild conspiracy theories hoax big deal. We're screwed. Ten million American families verge eviction. nothing's done stop this. outside whether smart not. $400 per month. $100 per week.  Every major country world able responsible take care get pandemic wave America shooting nothing read article understand relates /r/Coronavirus problem become problem country lets rot fester long fester.
 
America right practice run rest world. already started countries. Three tested negative two times PCR positive antibodies? wonder PCR testing site egregiously bad human error involved. Assuming 30% false negative, chance six false negs 0.07% (not 7% mind you). possibly one false positive antibodies truly negative. Thank god, I’m flying delta next week I’m terrified Y'all seem strangely happy this.  get point, virus outlive us all. dictatorship perks. ""WhErE bOdIeS?"" vision. Nobody smokes anymore. That’s point. aren’t race. racist towards them. She’s least 35.... Fans? NFL? WTF? Stay home people!!! ""As soon election virus go away, make Trump look bad reelection."" heard co-worker yesterday everyone else room agreed annoying people disrespect 145k people who've lost lives saying that. seem ignored ""upon reading"" part statement New Zealand even eradicated; they're ""close zero"". paying attention February March? Lots places ""close zero"" then...

4 years fastest vaccine ever created, viable timeline use. Tech advanced, past two diseases like (SARS MERS) never successful vaccines went away naturally, likely result here. complaining people covid labeled covid patients. That's supposed work, common sense. ""We're damned"" - Harold Lauder Nadine Cross? basic google searching, seems chicken pox vaccine prevent shingles (although cuts chance getting half).

There shingles vaccine, give older (than 50?).

I understand mechanism happens, though. indeed correct- sequence thoughts.

not surprised.

And disgusted.

if could put parenthesis around surprised order operations english would. think alcohol wipes bleach disinfecting wipes leaking plastic? going add medical audit goes finds hospital falsified data intentionally insurance purposes gets hit HUGE fine lawsuit. really hospital's best interests accurately report. bringing dying family member hospital, almost certainly exposed already. :-/

And else done patient hospital bed? peak last curve? 7k per day? interesting see gets time, ideally point lock downs prep health system goes deeper little Russian propaganda. starts school learn fetishise flag get bullied stand national anthem every day.

It's codified laws allow workers protections, disallow gimp unions, provide adequate education even basic healthcare.

The Russian propaganda work fertile soil work on. American culture psychopathic. Depends vaccine. Prevnar best-selling product. awesome post - glad see ask evidence. cannot give me. Now, turns out, cannot understand question. Sir, American education system fucked up. New Zealand extreme plenty countries reaching close zero point.

Where pulling 4 year figure from? assuming ability treat Covid 4 years going significantly greater now? Since when? Source? He’s going lose black democrat Indiana post-2008 era. He’s also term-limited he’s going primaried. 

My guess he’s simply hoping drive adoption golly gee shucks small town attitude that’s served well politically. Kind Mayberry-esque, “well I’ve made required. ain’t gonna knock door check you’re wearin’ one know Aunt Bee’s immune system ain’t hot let’s right thing, here.” Ireland every person diagnosed Corona virus dies classified corona virus death unless proven otherwise. It’s much leap. It’s like they’re saying people hit bus Corona related. 

They retracted numbers later date. watch daily briefings evenings I’m happier slightly report opposed underreport. country perfect system this, everyone basically making go, I’m happy Irish response outside nursing home fiasco. owners son shot two men, nothing article indicated asshole, capable defending people hit car, left, returned unknown intentions. Go shopping northern Idaho relatively common. guy sweat pants, ball cap side arm shopping Safeway open carry. woman standing line Subway Sandwich restaurant open carry side arm.  man Walmart open carry told little boy cool gun response tell protect 2nd amendment rights. Another fellow Home Depot side arm. one full day shopping Canadian alarming me. never ever felt safety threatened places might require use firearm. Technically true, know nurses taken oath hearts, they're better people i--a surgical resident--am. read lot reviews kinds businesses time. cant remember last time even saw yelp. still exist? old people using now, like BBB? Certainly, least cursory search look up. Especially running redundant ones, even using open source protocol. privacy step, spoofed MAC addresses also play small role. several devices rotate through, multiple burners helps. 

Most maintaining profile difficult get to, burn entirely ideal. ""they"" come looking find you. hard find ok there, idea stop getting layers. Agree there’s way could replace 200,000 teachers, would also lose retirement benefits. 

Still better losing life guess many friends saw well file unemployment February. changed since then, great! making close $100k prior getting laid got maxed $450 week. one finding cross wears really strange? Agree there’s way could replace 200,000 teachers, would also lose retirement benefits. 

Still better losing life guess work two assumptions:

1) everyone going contract Covid point.

2) nothing going change 3-4 years whatever arbitrary time mentioned.

Meanwhile, several potential vaccines development, well multiple drugs treat symptoms. ability combat Covid going much stronger across course lifespan. 

Not mention reducing cases initially (the called ""flattening curve"") reduces strain healthcare services manageable level, cases treated much effectively get people waiting ambulances bed space hospitals. We're #1! We're #1! Now, imagine scenario, tens thousands times schools open up. populations. point falls without even made.

[New Zealand population density 15 people per square whilst [Melbourne 508 per per square agree lot points.

Private number bad idea could easily fixed.

Mask manufacturing australia happening. probably happened earlier, we're country established infrastructure textiles manufacturing scale asian countries surprise took longer. Also, theres masks $3 local Bunnings weeks, well slightly expensive fabric ones local chemists since first outbreak. Give suburb I'll link local store nearby stock. rumours ""no supply!! price gouging!!"" hugely overblown murdoch rags.

More trackers / public servants would great pretty clear they're struggling get enough people trained working time frame. someone who's worked healthcare call centre takes 3 months date industry works. I'd imagine theres training needed virology judging risk factors well. Unfortunately went pretty low / stagnant cases second wave weeks. possible ramp call centres hundreds trained employees strong overnight.

Unfortunately true following checking people. hope future bank professional nurses / epidemiologists banked ready go full databasing system disease tracking pre made deployed end infrastructure hope develop keep future. could argue already, would agree life long labour voter, also understand got expense pretty significant liberal governments perspective considering fact used global pandemic. sucks consequence countries vehement belief liberal cost cutting perspective.

Locking non essential businesses already happened. agree theres remaining open could close many borderline see government choosing allocate time elsewhere rather trying write specific laws defining exactly essential every office supply store niche grocer.

We actually agree - agree black white obviously Victoria's fault nothing more. There's significant balancing act every minor decision severe repercussions difficult predict far reaching. 

Every tiny decision consequences whilst could done many things better, many successful countries listed advantages benefit paint situation ""vic stupid everywhere else smart"" exactly Murdoch media keep printing gets us divided, angry clicking garbage headlines. paranoid delusions. &lt;&lt; Someone get Erusea line! asteroid-killing railguns build! one... told I'd along six colleagues two friends 30s died. almost hospitalised, move 3 days... muscle... 

He said sorry it... deaths imaginary.... wished family friends got could watch suffer. proud though go head. angry... interesting take argument is, ""it's easy hospitals classify every death Covid investigation cause death, hearth attack seizure put Covid death that's deaths high"" neither plan go lockdown slow initial spread government could set national health safety guidelines. Expanding testing capabilities making sure enough beds patients lockdown lifted could avoid exact situation we're now. Instead following doctors, trump decides he's going call hoax make fun joe biden wearing mask. fact virus still exists level anywhere means no-one country safe forever. One world, one giant play area SARS-COV2. face infections again. least strategy though. Yup. I've ignoring daily calls, emails texts see want work icu hot spots (e.g. Texas, Florida, Georgia, NC, etc.) Half country wants murder African-Americans also believes virus hoax... never understood this, doctors wearing masks years. never complained. whenever blows I'm flying Delta. upvote, quibble sentence structure. shocked disgusted

You mean, ""I disgusted shocked""? is, ambiguous. Hmmmm sure pick great time graduate college. sure love going back parents house $50,000 debt time. u/Gov_Deathsentence found imposter! May good boy bucks now? put tape valve another neck gaitor n95. it’s shown valve uncovered still significantly slows speed/distance aerosol particles might make through. cloth masks would cause way spread comparison people constantly adjusting slip face, aerosol particles drift right sides surrounding air (obviously still effective limiting spread compared nothing). Look bright side guys....still better America. also dont pay social security medicare unemployment keep even someone making 24/hour Nobody forces people go out. I'm predicting end COVID19 Americans know someone died result COVID19. I’m UK judgement isn’t amazing governor seems one really giving shit people guess that’s something.
And record I’d give internal organ live well done Trump gotten serious addressed covid properly April, people forget things remember this.

He say whatever wants grab many ***** wants still win reelection. crazy that?

The not-elected leader country going win landslide managed bring covid cases right things. Bingo. People concealed carry put lot emphasis first word. know least 4 friends gun near often not, know we're close friends. I've riden driven cars know holsters hidden. talk it, volunteer information casual conversation. get whole oath thing

The oath force quit. force treat others risk life. Except idea say, unfounded opinions. asked stole, said steal time. asking thieves going steal? Yes, that's they're kicked out. What's pathetic told never standing man. Soon China decide Reddit adult cut like popular websites. Enjoy brief visit.  Well track reach 200 k deaths September.

The upside kills Trump, perhaps literally almost chance we'll seeing office next year. Even die hard fans hard time ignoring many deaths. Ah yes forgot that. Makes lot sense now, crazy system could also feed babies nothing coke turn fine (me siblings). Horrendous parents.

Breast milk *best* health, can't feed breast milk, formula next best option. Actually article pretty clear NYC highest exposure 23%. still long way heard immunity, 24x came state low case rate 24x still 3% population.

If accept death rate 1 70 (1.4%), 140k deaths result 10 million actual cases. treatments probably better death rate might going maybe 12 million cases? remind me, still hurts much... Wouldnt still risky bodily fluids? dont understand masks sex thing all. also get struck lightening, die car crashes - heck, there's chance Michael Jackson still alive &amp; he's secretly serial killer... begin basing every decision make unlikely scenarios? Time seal state. Looks like know place highest death count phone carry around interact, literally tracks almost everything do. Opposition figures journalists *supposedly* murdered. exclusively quoting articles EU US sources every reason biased. Would believe everything said quoted nothing Russian media? Tell it’s obvious work least little anyone isn’t moron, n95 better absolutely work. wrong killing people. mask wearers wrong, oh no, slight discomfort. 😭

Which way logic dictate go situation like that? 🖖😷 mean woman held fact corona virus everyone. would called stupidity reason gotten education instead popping kids . kissed... Pretty sure government said masks useless saying order allow hospital medical people available one. enough masks time would tell people wear them.

Now production caught buy masks . I'm honestly curious hurricane season going hit south play this. NBA chose covid hot bed open in, right prime hurricane season. Florida gets hit displaces people virus going right long NBA probably season.

Thats two fuck yous tack onto pandemic.  Fair I've noticed rates generally higher start. larger population, that's probably reason why. Today 14 38 new cases age range, reason much women, 11-3. 10 60 above. 'And outdoor tent could serve 100 attendees, attorneys couple say less ideal “greatly limits number persons attend wedding, protect wedding guests adverse weather, including driving rain hot cold temperatures.”'

And everyone saying care guests wellbeing? obviously care enough protect rain, hot cold /s inferred. implied nothing sort. Islands clearly defined borders.

Don't countries clearly defined borders? Even road/river/fence? (I realise EU different.) realise job police enforce laws?  Imagine happens. kids bringing home parents.

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like nightmare somehow get worse. antibody test: four people know wanted donate blood vaccine development, tested negative antibodies, included.

Edit: know makes difference, we're Ohio mutates like cold. Measles still around &amp; it’s fairly ancient. enough people vaccinate, it’ll become familiar again. 

  least think that’s means (but IANAMD).  It’s simple that. infectious conditions TB readily spread young children. It’s important distinguish elementary school age children middle high school. kind already demonetize smaller creators every little slight? Many watch/enjoy curtail language straight censor certain ""trigger"" words phrases.

Or due content (horror/investigative/ARG) they've already lost monetization ""fit"" YT's business model, even though immensely popular many adults enjoy watching them. Bridezilla Groomzilla?

Virtual works Again. Thats always possible. Especially now. lot people tied jobs insurance. Thank link info!  Good idea. Especially screaming, singing bottle neck space football game. know american fans obey pandemic rules since Texas flattened curve infections risk all. 
Don't tell /s needed. They've gotten two countries one point dozen cases worldwide. Slight uptick hundred globally.

http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/

Of course, stays way world maintains effort presently it'll start spread again. There's chance could wipe wild like smallpox always, last step always florida senior disagree. voted neither guys. Yet still die stupidity. state can't stop surge. even surge anymore. never ending tidal wave.

Sending kids, teachers, staff schools asking surge one able stop time foreseeable future. good news then? Yes 17 years ago met. started heavy conspiracies recently yeah sucks. Furthermore, transcript briefing Feb 12 (emphasis time, partners reporting higher usual demand select N95 respirators face masks. CDC currently recommend use face masks general public. **This virus spreading community**. sick patient investigation hospitalized, CDC recommends wearing face mask around people entering health care provider’s office, alone, home, need wear mask. People close contact someone novel coronavirus, example, household contacts care givers people known suspected 2019, I’m sorry, nCoV 2019, wear face mask room patient patient able wear face mask.

They absolutely screwed up, mask recommendation mistake. mistake naively believed told community spread. pretty clearly *lie*. However, believing community spread probably bigger blunder. Class traitor We've dropping 1,000 day, what, 4 months now? toobwas thinking poor Michigan ""Patriots"" driving hours way go Lowe's Ohio Indiana put piece cloth face 30 minutes. sad them. must read article - do, please direct one STUDY (scientific, pre-print - even care peer reviewed not) suggests Covid-19 reinfection possibility. please share King's College London study reference acquired immunity cellular memory. I'll wait ....

While it, give guy read: Also, nearly half Americans get flu shot every year. even possible really wanted could already chipped majority Americans without without even knowing. God damn idiots. ever heard walker tennis balls front? 

Like that.  county Florida pushed start date 2 weeks. individual county overall decision medically necessary. NZ it. went hard early, essentially closing everything.

Good luck that. agree. exactly essential? letting pubs. Sports, gyms open? What? moving possible? Like get different job good thing. big mistake country making encourage outdoor activities. converting streets parking lots outdoor areas.

California’s big problem right people inviting friends family homes socializing indoors. gave people options outdoor activities, would easier convince stop that.  Instead, framed “businesses bad, home good!” think it’s okay engage risky behavior home. Houston, problem. [God heard know hell trying say pulling nonsense stats thin air. clearly prove stats wrong, move goal posts. ""Oh 99% world, mean, specific countries I'm thinking of, countries"".  shall go find states (lets say Hawaii) lower case/day per capita stats right say Portugal Switzerland Luxembourg Spain various industrialized countries say ""oh well said \*every\* state obviously mean states"" Come on, grow up. No, simply implied story incorrect...""funny *these* stories""... idea. ask since want keep talking longer too. washington state,usa ""I see dead people."" states medical exemption only

Mississippi one along West Virginia (who stringent come close) measles outbreak since 1992 1994 respectively last time looked. Number #1 #2 US childhood vaccination rates believe well. No, mouthbreathe respirator time. Makes easier inhale/exhale force required overcome filters activate exhaust. Problem USA, stupid like. can't come visit us anymore, stay home next years. See ya later. -World. risk students in-person learning low, cost keeping schools closed enormous.""

And literally every person comes contact said students? live personal bubble, wrong guy? couple years back British lab found smallpox bottom freezer forgot about. think destroyed it. government doesn’t enforce masks either. pick Lowe’s? 

I’ve yet see video someone getting arrested anywhere USA mask. deserve much getting now. appreciate you, couldn’t doing. Please make sure taking care yourself. OK, well shopping Lowe's anytime soon :\] 

They easily hire professionals wanted to. exactly type thing looking for! Thank you! cant. areas close school work. Moving isnt possible landlords know that. PCR test turnaround times week 10 days many places now

I've seen reports (on reddit, could fake) people waiting 3 weeks USA. I'm definitely team outdoors still outdoor things extreme social distancing. local venue set outdoor space selling 100 tickets night seated tables purchasing group GA space stand place chair 6 feet someone else. local theater selling blocked spaces per group size create 7 10 feet groups. I'm looking soccer Omaha sells per 2 3 person group pre-selected locations keep people apart. 

50% capacity still way many together! Certainly case, Karen’s would less (or maybe more??) whine cop 10k fine allowed actially ? like woman multiple roommates kids home, totaling 16 people together, infected every single one afford work? Got it. People refuse wear masks, think masks conspiracy, think virus overblown. Wait Donny holds promise deploy military administer vaccine sending military Portland throw protesters black unmarked vehicles. 

Everything done, destroyed future credibility confidence correct process procedures. Well there's lots evidence antibody tests arent great. look 50%, heard conversation, correct definitely wrong that. According read two tests guess one good false positive rate test good false negative rate means tests pretty accurate depending illness test you. However stand fact due low number tests america coupled high asymptomatic rate leads believe considerable amount people disease cdc say. report people tested positive lots people dont get tested, think are. Well would lower death rate. Princess Beatrice could small socially distanced wedding, everyone else too.

For know, Princess Beatrice, one Queen's grandchildren due get married May 29th. However, wedding got cancelled British government announced lockdown March 23rd. weddings banned, work wedding dress came halt March well, embroiders allowed gather together room make dress due government's covid rules.

The govt lifted lockdown 4th July, allowing socially distanced indoor weddings 30 people present.

Instead waiting till next year, Princess Beatrice bridegroom decided go ahead socially distanced wedding, reasoning getting married important thing.

Only 16 people present small church Queen's estate. (The bride groom, parents siblings, siblings' children, Queen Prince Philip). Instead new dress Princess Beatrice wore old dress Queen's 1960's (as dress still unfinished). hymns sung (as govt banned them), instead recorded music played. 

And pictures, proving socially distanced weddings romantic happy standard weddings, maybe enforcing either. legal rights meaning make medical decisions

Edit word Nearly 150,000 lost souls span four months low. dumb conspiracy reason even need order track us. could buy data Google Facebook, Microsoft able collect info already. guys invented Antivaxx flat earther tho.  Yeah, jobless REALLY need stay fuck away people. 
Get sick you’ll hope died crippling medical debt you”ll find in. 
Fuck country backwards. Way! good thing hear. I'm one them, 6 month feeling great. Tho smoked weed, I've quit too, could I'd give pat back! Keep everyone! Go New Zealand!!!

(Don't know people downvoting post ...) Yes, is. comment thread extremely disappointing read. victims pandemic Texas mostly Hispanic. worst hit hospital systems right valley. typical MAGA losers, despite you’re seeing state government.

Stop fucking blaming victims shitty Republican governance. Depends UK, Scotland compulsory masks week two, England compulsory Friday. I'm 100% Wales NI though 12,000 child care centers state covid positivity rate 20%. i'm sorry :( go vacation you, mind asking? hand, French radioactive waste went Germany mysteriously radioactive anymore crossed border March 2020: use mask know use dangerous = enough mask Tell lie, Frenchs handle it.

If recall, France following recommendations WHO.

The (based flu studies, iiuc) considered masks dangerous useful hands people know use understand limitations.

Turns wrong. that's case French government following experts.

(also, yeah, enough masks) amount antivaxxers country covid I'm curious vaccinations.  think numbers fake. Literally first line article 

""Abstract Importance: therapy date shown improve survival patients infected SARS-CoV-2."" 

Lol  Well remember protests? 

People would downvote hell mentioned spread virus....which trending spiked immediately 2 weeks afterwards.  

“They wore masks “ State health department websites.. Exactly. cases started rising would post 'wAiT tWo wEekS!!"" ""Two weeks"" here. goodwill fucked repeatedly. need goodwill pass laws enforce lockdown. hate Murdoch. Probably do. using hate give Andrews pass bullshit. Saying can't fix things nonsense. Everyone wants fixed fixed right. People would somehow rebel stage four. got message asking copy messages, normal? Doctors work locked down, many US right now.

Okay, arguing sake arguing better things do. boat parade won’t spread virus much all. Maryland cases rising positivity rate falling one assume increasing number confirmed casos necessarily correlate directly testing 7-11 Park City cashier told they’re allowed confront anybody without mask aggressive reaction might get. told roto rooter guy fight it. Dude job, uniform. people risking jobs it? doesn’t make sense. ah yes Americans, shit am, Like prevented every industrialized first world country? bringing dying family member hospital, almost certainly exposed already. :-/

It's 100% thing increase exposure counts. also ways reduce risk home, aware risk. less possible poor people may live crowded else done patient hospital bed?

Probably makeshift hospitals people isolated get help try survive. they're ""death part life"" people. There's good coping mechanisms bad ones. Drinking ok rare occasion. Using go coping mechanism no. coming someone toes line what's ok sometimes trips ok side. Ebola never outbreaks outside West Africa. headline reading states ""1,000+ deaths per day"" know threat. gas bunch people? Logically cases, chance death stays equal, results death. amount times I've heard ""It's make Trump look bad"" depressing. Although, he's handled poorly every turn, see might think that. Well science denying president downplayed months treated responses attack personally. saying Americans dumber every country largely controlled it? possible anti-science narcissistic leader screwed pooch short amount time people self control stay inside?  Thanks massive protests without social distancing. going month see new cases explode since.  literally back (obviously brought outside...). Less month entire country put full effort eradicate. global pandemic goes longer 12 months, see stupid celebrate country 3 months in... assume used demographics, not, eventually settle score, there's cheating (unless fake census guess). said travel restrictions unnecessary racist US almost cases. think made change mind? check out. Unless changed figures, seems estimated covid deaths 28% higher officially given. virus care anything except replicating new hosts Jeez alot social distancing wearing masks? Kind worrying like see bad gotten countries recently. Tbh masks need mandatory. give people option choose majority unfortunately bother. 

Quick question regarding making masks mandatory. Can't Canada's government issue nationwide mandatory mask rule Canada done individual provinces? God damnnit 600 million, 500 million 100 million. Every subreddit amount... Yesterday country news, written 9 10 australians diagnosed covid 7-21 july, lived lives like nothing happend (no carantine, going shoping, going work etc)?

Is news real? is, fcked egoistic (most?) ppl are...  navy lot medical personnel move quickly. Texas 90% white 100 years ago Stupid stupid People like shit Brazil well Pretty sure joking. That's disagree shutdown public safety measures.  Managed what? happen airline tho Congratulations, US virus now... 9-11 every day, come, baby surpass again? supposed go up? He's sarcastic Excuse me, yes possible hard lockdown. hard lockdown possible indefinitely.

 Spain lifted July 2nd thru 20th look eerily similar March 2nd thru 20th... Kaufland Bavaria, even cashiers wear masks properly, though required so, since they're behind plexiglass barrier.

Same customers (but they're required wear mask), like 2% ""Pimmelnasen"". I'm UK personally knew 2 people died covid19 related pneumonia. nice way die. based quite bit Dr. Fauci's work though. way his, words. Please help us American, patriotic, embarrassed means testing enough sadly Ignorant morons indeed. majority husband’s extended family COVID deniers since beginning pandemic. touted didn’t know anyone COVID, one got sick going bar. 20 exposed 4th July weekend celebration cabin shared. thought would least wake denial, quarantined 5 days decided must real didn’t get sick. positive test one person got? “Must fluke” (despite sicker ever). top off, kept plans host large indoor maskless wedding short 2 weeks cabin without disclosing info guests. Irresponsible finest. I’m glad husband didn’t inherit denier gene. indeed 'polishing turd' feel it. 

In europe I've seen similar news articles, negative tone. 'No chance herd immunity', 'CV stay', on. antibodies start disappear 90 days. (although necessarily means immunity...) clearly doesnt care either world hurt winter. Lol people like shit USA Brazil absolute champion comes Corona. 2.2 million cases almost 50% positivity rate... earth getting downvoted for? Da fuck wrong reddit days. Except gov't funding funneled them. go much effort, grab random reality tv persona debt, rig elections, get puppet president?

Oh wait, that's Russia. stupid way! Prepubescent Af bro done full lock March would okay now, yeah agree that. evidenced fact many countries full lock various points outbreak, nearly better outcomes US. argue semantics words ""lock down"" night, thi k anyone going interested that. 

Lock mean nobody leaves reason. trying say think holding straw man. op said simple hyperbole. rational thinking person would read literally. Vaccines? Probably 3-4 years marketability - basis timeline.

Again, ""your timeline"" make less yeah, flatten curve herd immunity tactic - thats goal along.

Did even read said? Flattening curve overwhelming healthcare services. course herd immunity ultimate goal - matter attained. probably going vaccine rather everyone getting disease. Middle class least 40,000 year low end six figures high end. fact median income well bracket indicative wage stagnation occurred past decades. K Ironically, majority people think COVID hoax never met God, hey believe he/she exists.

I believe God, also believe virus real. can’t one other. quarantined france go back nyc I'm shook af. maybe like 1/3 people see wear masks. one distances. girlfriend going work shoulder shoulder packed subways lot people masked up. gonna hit back sure. Yeah legit concerns someone required wear jumpsuit Karens Kevins freely open wear shorts flip flops crop top take mask they're outdoors away people. everyone position wear damn mask. passed dementia test! last 5 questions super hard!!! Queensland too, amazing, realize meant Queensland said northern territory. Mass graves Staten Island pretty real agree, one note. opinion, calling public broadcasting Germany (=Öffentlich-rechtlicher Rundfunk) state media actually bit misleading, implies direct influence government therefore used propaganda, case. Contrary many crackpots like claim. stems Donald fucking Trump. exactly Canada decided group (except Alberta, dragging along slowly)

It helps. still hunt/fish much really want to. hearing crazy stuff coming Australia lately, almost like Aus America 2.0. cant know happening poorest countries world.

We barely know going developed ones even contagious numbers Get away reddit bit.It good. That's higher every single infectious disease (tuberculosis 4 thousand per day).  laughed hard read comment. got upvote.

Edit: fair oh, might bode well light flu season US. mean, full no-holds-barred mega lockdown absolutely everyone ~3 weeks March could completely squashed thing, everyone would back buying consumer goods like usual occasional hotspots virus appearing every controllable isolated areas. economy would done best strong leadership said ""We're total lockdown avoid dragged-out perpetual semi-lockdown state next 3-5 years.""

This original post. said nothing lockdown working said 100% lockdown literally everyone work. know everyone includes? Doctors. I'm knowing 6. Friends Family members mostly. I'm lucky one family yet. Mother Step Father teachers high risk health complications... preparing go back school. Maybe quarantine made people realize hate fucking kids realize Hong Kong recorded highest number new cases (over 100) literally days ago? Classic blunder...you need call issue federal mandate. reverse psychology works. quotes weird Greiten's corruption quote sounds pretty standard. missing something? Correct I'm wrong Sydneys population density 423km2 Melbourne like 508km2. seems rather low compared say European cities quite American cities? New Zealand 24 days without Covid tourists brought back country. Feb/March pretty close start spread, course plenty close zero countries.

SARS MERS nearly much worldwide impact consequently level research investment. Projections Covid vaccine well 4 years. already plenty phase 2 &amp; phase 3 I'd love closed too. agree you. 

But cant pull politically cant pull off. Hell look yourself, goodwill people there. Vic Gov's back wall. time ""perfect"" choices february. 

I guess fact seriously pose ""blame murdoch"" reason dismiss point says enough however. cant agree biased, monopolistic media bad definitely wont agree anything else here. pedantic tiny differences wording instead coming grips actual point.

New Zealand's lockdown intense, worked, shhhhhhh. stripclub without fucking like vegan hamburger, useless Put panel. I’ll review social media turn away went bars parties, didn’t wear masks, etc NY State averaging 16 deaths day.  :/ Absolutely. US years, rate - developed countries good measures place already do.

We're going say ""right, lockdown over, everybody go back doing."" Here, we've eased restrictions significantly, plenty people able still working home. shops businesses relying footfall re-opened, masks mandatory distancing measures place. There's free hand sanitiser everywhere. Testing widely available, free easy access. Schools phased return, certain year groups back. Bars restaurants moved app ordering payment reduce contact. perspex screens supermarkets banks protect staff. Measures place enable 'track trace' outbreak clusters suspected infections identified early. 

R rate 1 falling. fewer fewer cases, measures safely lifted eased. I'm sure look countries like Italy, France Spain, gone 1000+ daily deaths &lt;10, say possible R &lt; 1. getting paid? employers making bank? Weird. Privatized health care weird. may ignorant people Earth. Tell penis  Yup... school district starting person classes 8/13, require masks (until Governor drops mandate)...

Oh... football/volleyball starts 11 days.

That’s county posting 60-70 cases day. based population, isn’t small numbers. know least one nurse hotspot state that, month ago, thought virus hoax. comes conservative family relatives share conspiracy theories. seen share ""plandemic"" stuff while, though, maybe changed mind. 

Gotta say, wild see go straight posting COVID hoax stuff pro-BLM stuff (despite family members it). Maybe got heart/head all. still pretty young new nursing. Post bullshit everyday wont change FACT, run one end building fact breath mask. take rocket scientist see fact mask impede airflow. Facts east see wre directly way airflow. fact doctors science full lobbyist bullshitters. 

Imagine thinking something covering face wont making breathing harder.

Science ever fat? helped raise awareness many people. program helped. flu bro It’s data showing specific set metrics, dweeb. It’s data showing likely spread occurring. Communal transmission occurring tight, close settings maskless contact large number minutes.

Incidentally walking past someone who’s maskless corona masked low chance transmission.

You can’t compare COVID 19 death count assault death count, much transmission occurred following proper protocols individual. impressed that, wait find Japanese.. Exactly. Also, one needs take consideration what's criteria behind people tested, i.e. whether selection biases degree influence results, especially vs before. nuts. need another lock down. sucks people lose jobs happens Republican states wanted half ass everything. problem openly stated death person tests positive covid regardless cause death counted covid death It’s downright un-American yield iceberg. You’ve got show sucker who’s boss! issue mask breathing mask squeezes nostrils together bit making harder breathe. I'm trouble properly fit nose bridge glasses :/ 


But anyway, wonder anti-maskers... often say masks ineffective let virus time say masks let enough oxygen through... know oxygen molecules MUCH SMALLER viruses thus debunk claims way? called priorities. 

A disease kills indiscriminately one majoritly caused due laziness. 

We government combat dieases time. They've proven incapable dealing obesity things normal, let alone things beginning spiral control. earth would able expect aid people combating dieases government economy currently spiraling control. way estimate (or low-end estimate 250,000) could possibly accurate 3 reasons.

1. current covid activity Victoria linked back hotel quarantine outbreak rest country seems great. virus would still raging everywhere many people infected.
2. Australia recorded 133 deaths 500,000 infections would 0.027% IFR (less flu). Considering US state New Jersey 0.178% entire population die virus far wrong.
3. According Australian Department Health: ""following high start 2020 interseasonal period, currently, influenza influenza-like illness (ILI) activity lower average across systems time year."" undiagnosed covid outbreak kind scale possibly normal It’s already ruined back campus parties, including early athletic training. Fall going shit-show in-person classes dorm life shared showers. guy discovered HIV turned homeopathy father molecular biology thought vitamin C cured cancer. even name, Nobel’s disease.

I’m scientist. know Mullis deranged views. doesn’t think HIV causes AIDS. also qPCR regularly. know works far better you. whole prison populations caught virus saw 1% IFR. confusing Americans grown tired WINNING already?

seriously tho, stay safe vote blue November. total still million. 

We barely nascar race worth’s people far, worries. Time drop friends look article there's pictures, people sitting 6 feet apart lawn chairs. crowd socially distant. capped 10k venue 2k people 1k showed sit 6 ft apart lawn.

I'm worried rodeo saw people snapchatting elkhorn. least 1000 people dancing tightly packed crowd. want happen. protests better. despite island nation 3rd highest global death rate. done much better. lack competent thinking across leadership baffles me. many people needlessly dead cos this. South Korea lost 250 people, we’ve lost around 45,000 trashed economy process. sacrificed kids education open bars, casinos, gyms, barber shops.

Which shows world exactly valued America time. It’s pretty amazing, considering Democrats controlled presidency houses Congress 2009-2011, really happened passing Obamacare. big fan Söder either, Bavaria worse others given. Bavaria lot people travelling to, from, it.  Yeah, also... give shit safety. China wants something built fast use material, take risk expense workers, build shoddily want. collapses, well, no, didn't, shut up.  Yup. Obesity also issue need care about. It’s #1 moment. Obesity deeply related poor mental health care status developed world. long way go, still fighting it. Covid forefront now, be. shit? implies see similar situation US. no? haha two tests done person would independent, someone tested false negative would likely average test false negative again, due relatively low levels virus presence airway. yes inexperienced clinician unreliable antibody tests could also factor in. Merica idea tbh. lot stupid entitled “patriotic” “freedom” loving half-brained asshats thinks fucking experts Covid-19. That’s every time go walk dogs see unmasked idiot look funny way, give “you’re dumbass” glare. Us Americans fucking stupid. Dumbasses sides political spectrum Except living lives though accept helpful instruction how... Thank you!  exposed virus binary thing infected infected. exposed virus going breath in, increasing chances complications death. taking care somebody dying virus going get you. surreal. live Germany agree government amazing far, reacted dignity, scientific thinking, reason consideration. yet many people see street nasty, gross, ignorant selfish, noses hanging masks everywhere, ""opinions"", protests against... Corona whole guess?... Etc.
The purpose government (to, ya know, GOVERN) never clear. tell idiots enforce correct behavior. heartbreaking realize that, sadly, majority people selfish, dumb, incredibly cold others' pain. children allowed type control decisions influence rest population.
Loud words speeches nothing. Money nothing. Charisma nothing - Merkel arguably little it. soul brain head, works people first prestige dead fucking last. leader motivated anything else leader all. Maybe best rest world America Dies. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Everyone despises you, huh? 

Get grip. Probably not, Donnie, microwave spying tool left Obama Clorox great cure, much tremendous best cure Corona. one ever died Corona using gallon Clorox cure. Believe me. wrong.

Part 2 answer question anyway? WHO'S going it? you? Everyone thinks going back work right need survive entitled definition. tell right Karen's going scrubbing toilet.

Sure will, people willing price goes up. Karen spends much earns little loses middle-class standing, skills, may well to. Again, see individuals, classes. always going people various skill levels need work. That's thing though, use 99% money businesses. 

That's so. 1% hoarding cash. value real also realize bigger company gets likely outscource work countries? Look apple every 24h call center. lot cheaper pay day workers another country pay Americans work nights. cheaper pay child American adult because... rights!

No, restrictions. got rid minimum wage laws make hiring Americans expensive, big companies would hire Americans. complain countries fall line plans elevate worker rather egotistical. stretched Mark Zuckerberg's earned 2018 throughout entire life point, he'd still made around $6mil DAY! obviously way knowing going, may investing it.

Yes, could that...*if got rid Facebook*. (Presumably good investor also owns real estate stocks such, that's majority value) liquidated holdings Facebook, he'd plenty money that, people able talk friends share memes plan events. people work Facebook would find new jobs. companies sell servers load balancers cafeteria food Facebook would lose sales.

Sure do. will. I've seen happen many times throughout life. young, one knew microwave. TVs weight 50 pounds, 19 inch screens, got 8 channels. Cars went 15 miles gallon leaded gas.

That said never solid evidence support chloroquine covid treatment, first failed trials put bed focus shifted drugs. wonder Trump talking 24/7 impact getting attention deserved even among scientific community. Part 1 say right way? asked it, that's answer, realize time England?

I say said it. asking. think right way. countries engaged conquest, conquest See there's thing talking before. lack lot empathy sexually assulted, tortured, forced enslavement murdered time somewhere conquered.

Well, point victims oppressors long dead. yeah, empathy well runs dry Yes. greatest country one wealth technology, useless living allow access even live comfortable life without breaking back.

No, I'm saying, think agreed to, past countries flourished ones committed atrocities. past, would make choice country either commit atrocities, flourish conquered country *is* willing commit atrocities. words, standard right wrong demands countries suffer right. think messed-up know Germany still thing right? admire shit them. saw we're ashamed happened. started paying reparations within 10 years, teach detail, many classes actually go sites themselves.

I'm saying murder problem US, problem murder per se, wrongthink. way deal murder way used to: strong policing ensure people murder quickly caught severely punished. Jokes aside, US could great country barely fufill definition ""the community people living particular country region shared customs, laws, organizations.""

Yes, that's be. bare minimum customs, laws, organizations shared among Americans. salute flag, sing anthem, protected military, use money. major laws like rape robbery murder, written state level. things like infrastructure education, handled local level. really much else shared people of, say, Arlington, Virginia Arlington, New saying immigrants helped now? 

Yes. immigrant country today find government assistance language. avail assistance education, finding job, finding housing. desperate need get food assistance shelter. Compare immigrant hundred years ago, work starve, learn English fast they're reason dropped culture?

Yes. Back then, people came become Americans. Vestiges culture would subsumed American culture. That's Chinese food US nothing like food China. trying preserve culture. reacting immigrant suspicion ""right way"" welcome one country?

Yes. want best immigrants. ones work hard, become professionals, maybe start businesses. want burden help. better us stay country. put immigrants I'm Christian, friends, neighbors, family entire human race. moment people referring specific ones mentioned, told take ones want out. difference me, see class status, see humans.

No, see class. asking did. see individuals, responsibilities well needs. someone wants leave, want improve, anyone else provide them? want to, that's fine. don't, get put burden Would say cashiers appreciated right now? certainly paid like are.

And Bill took fall foundation one pay research. tracking chip, it’s small tattoo (that conspiracy peeps also like call ‘Mark Beast’) injected skin along vaccine way show records received what.

Well, 30% believe that. give chance rest 70% get dose vaccine. shortage grateful stupidity. shitheads awfully loud. decades politicians slashing education spending come head. Surfaces don’t matter. Wearing masks doesn’t prevent people touching things. going gatekeep hand washing? Hint: can’t.

I don’t really care believe. It’s confirmed time communal spread come close contact people close settings, generally without masks on. Lowe’s doesn’t kind conditions need exist easy spread. Cashiers already behind plexiglass walls, floor employees must maintain distances regardless.

It much dangerous employee confront maskless customer significantly increases chances coming close contact well leading potentially violent escalation. safer every metric Lowe’s employees maintain distance masks on, keep good hand washing practice.

People emit lot infectious droplets talking, little silent. Cultures favour lots loud frequent talking, China, Italy Spain saw faster average spread. Cultures frown loud talking public like Japan, Germany Scandinavian nations saw slower average spread. studies show droplets produced goes voice loudness. opinion talking under-estimated risk factor, Japanese right idea asked patrons speak buses banned screaming roller coasters. trolls taken over. tag know show even delete history  Yeah exactly, that's power good prevention strategy. see Beijing outbreak put month? hospitals worse shape compared what?  first world countries.

This plain wrong.

Hospitals first-world countries similar problems. previous flu season, hospitals Italy postponed elective surgeries due lack ICU capacity; Covid-19, people left die corridors. UK used military support built 4,000 bed facility accomodate expected influx Covid-19 patients. Germany postponed non-essential surgeries. France train-lifted patients stricken regions hospitals across country spare capacity.

The main difference U.S. politicians decided flatten curve.

Note hospitals Italy many Germany for-profit, NHS German ""not-for-profit"" hospitals magic money trees either. Corona, German hospitals operated loss well, partly set government daily reimbursement empty beds. fucked world dude justify absolutely rubbish. never visited Australia still believe exists.

If would judge things real based personal experience it, end lot things believe exist. 

Hell, extend line thinking can't sure Trump exists never met guy. I’m almost 2 weeks without results Imbecile senseless understatements people. still pissed this? fucking get it. 1000 day signs slowing probably will. Um, face something else videos I've seen. shitty analogy! assumes death rate portrayed accurate, depends many factors, number people tested positive, country, age, pre-existing health condition, etc. CDC came best estimate 0.65% IFR, I'm willing bet it'll keep going people get tested.
If test 100 people positive 5 die, that's 5% death rate. Test 1000 still get deaths, that's 0.5%. order get accurate result, everyone would need tested, would account factors.

What pathetic joke. Stop digging. Basically eat virus food, higher chances ending stomach acids destroy (because increase saliva production, also likely drink food, factors reduce amount virus particles stay mouth attach ACE2 receptors, fraction compared lungs anyway, eating virus little chances causing infection).

Ugh, know going eventually bring Covid house infect everyone. statewide lockdown? China banning food movie theaters time around opening up....  People know asymptomatic mean contagious, right? That's great getting N95 masks hospitals shortages well common people? doctor medical professional, take information mind:

-If wearing N95 tight fitting face mask yes, protected.

-Those surgical style masks dont sit snug agaist face offer much less protection. However, wearning one stay meter apart people lower risk someone without mask, still risk getting virus (hence social distancing). Essientially, better nothing.  really anything extraordinary (apart implementing ""lockdown"" like, day earlier).

And waiting communal elections that. hand, infection largely dying Europe, meaning America still time catch up.

No European country breaking theii case records. go school. cannot force you. would recommend retaining legal counsel. Believe lawyer’s wet dream. school district 7 figures. Almost every metric deaths related illness considerably higher last years numbers.  

How explaining mysteriously double number pneumonia deaths last year? numbers certainly underreported. short likely contribute cases, small percentage. study released National Bureau Economic Research (1), concludes little effect COVID-19 spread may even led increase social distancing non-protest attendees.

A great example Minneapolis’ positivity rate (2): Minneapolis Department Health reported 15,000 people tested centers set communities affected protests, 1.7% tests came back positive—below statewide average 3.6%. According Washington Post, protest attendees Minneapolis returned positivity rates less 1% “officials believe low infection rates reflect protests outside, people wore masks people spent time motion, circulating crowd.” trend seen NYC resurgence cases. easily look data Google (protests started late May) major cities. 

Obviously still resurgence cities, LA. mayor recently stated protests contributed cases COVID, it’s difficult determine extent (especially given poor contact tracing place US). doesn’t seem likely protest primarily driving upsurge since number cases already increasing late April. addition, “infection transmission rates consistently tracked region’s increase mobility, researchers see based anonymized cell phone data” (3). 

Lastly, would say it‘s unlikely given protestors wearing masks / outdoors. Masks proven effective reducing spread COVID, general risk outdoors less well. Based one study conducted April, 1 318 outbreaks reported outdoor environment (4). we’ve seen far, risk COVID spread outdoor setting much much lower indoor setting - even moreso people taking necessary precautions (masks, social distancing, etc).

Hope helps!

However...as cases rise low medium risks groups we've shown absolutely zero political actually fully isolate protect high risk group. They're going get exposed eventually cases grow community. deaths lag catching up....It's lag high risk exposure, cases seem rise much deaths, deaths come cases controlled. Maskholes - love it.

But yay kind mouth nose covering! It’s election year unfortunately. sides try twist pandemic narrative makes look like heroes side look incompetent. Reddit quick side Democrats hard time trusting either party point time.  people's value society provide example do. learn. maskholes midst outbreaks. sub funny reviews? can't move Canada border open. legally immigrate, easy. Men diarrhea. That's probably why. shit.  Ironically, Black Death likely greatly mitigated implementation quarantines 80 days? That's long would expect grant ideal describe theoretically possible. time time, small scale government something right. history long run always get perverted. Government run people, people far perfect. bigger government people, harder run well.

If ever took part group project, tried democratically organise day out, amongst friends, know difficult build consensus small things. imagine many people convince interest completely opposite yours. asking requires super human, exists, did, moment go away, entropy takes things go shit again. 

This assuming people government basically good, naive assumption begin with. know two. likely second one. Might've already happened tbh pretty much entirely account better treatment; addition weak first. Except studies we've done show 90 days antibodies tend go down. Turns right 1100 deaths. Concerning indeed. However, deaths occurred yesterday, missed deaths occured past weeks one indian state (Tamil Nadu) added final figure. states done past, last month made India's deaths exceed 2000 one day particular day, went back 300-400 deaths day. 

Currently India's deaths 600 range take 7 day average. 

So India's daily deaths thousand. Yet. guess we're trying reach Vietnam's death toll... bombings occupation sixties. New Zealand one, fantastic un-China get. us first half ngl Yes country completely full lockdown, every country defined “essential jobs”. FULL lockdown everyone would disastrous economy (would employers forced pay wages times? so- small businesses would go bankrupt. not- poor people money get food lockdown) would huge death toll (a rise suicides, people need immediate medical care, people would starve death one deliver food)
Also, virus might survive 3 weeks. household 5 people, could circulate 2 half months worst case scenario, it’s unlikely, need one instance virus survive)

Obviously nothing like Trump currently bad, balance needs found flattening curve entering depression mean winning?! 
USA USA USA!!!! WOOOOO dare u voted leaders bottom top. People flock Texas Florida taxes low. serious threat occurs sure wish paid little better services. Remember China saw people drop streets? like zombie movie. US folks told stay home mild symptoms. turn. person family aren’t prepared. person expires. biohazard site.

Chooses 80 days article. Lol. Add ""long lasting"" extra laughs. We’re kind making go along. helps little. maintaining distance definitely help. 'If live people would WAYY careful'.

You live someone though. may end asymptomatic, giving roommate without knowledge. shitty genetics luck worsened roommate could taken better preventative measures.

Dont get wrong, seem aware many age. consider 'being tired' though nothing excuse risky behavior. valid reason. many ways socialize reducing risk. Theme park one them.

Choose close friend two trust, self isolate 2 weeks, meet safe setting. agree covid bubble, see other, anyone else, go risky places, actually really safe hang out.

My fam lives within 30 mins this. know exactly everyone goes (phone tracking) socializing other. rather safe trust there. Even kids elderly grandmother. know everyone masks grocery trips, keeping essentials only, seeing friends outside trust bubble, risk zero, pretty low much self isolating. whole catastrophe absolutely grand lesson mental paradigms, framing inaccurate risk assessment caused blasé attitudes beliefs. Millions Americans go church every Sunday listen rich old man tell enough faith prayers reshape reality. surprised act it. Menards best lumber yard three? really hard say, you’re single adult 20’s masters degree? curious good lockdown early weeks everyone got lockdown fatigue. Back late March streets practically deserted cars. skyscraper fell day would care then? Ffs. It’s fucking mask. actual hell. worked shop once, wear masks. Everyone unconscious floor time. 0 oxygen. never got work done. poorest people need most? They're ones problem handling rent, medical bills, etc? Sounds completely flipped upside makes sense all.

Here almost opposite. government pays sick leave outside 12 days (it's actually 4x 3 day periods), capped 70,000$ per year, high income actually necessary, government going keep paying that.

What understand even functional makes economic sense. I've appendix burst 20 work full month. got paid entire month paid 0$ medical treatment. get paid pay pocket cost medical treatment well, I'd really struggle, making 17$ hour minimum wage - still little savings (although must admit spending like drunken sailor time). Can't even imagine I'd get first place made 10$ hour (although costs living might higher here). I've also 6 weeks due knee surgery, also free got paid whole period. happens US end bankrupt homeless relocate, could possibly force quit work even longer. sound cruel, sounds idiotic economic perspective well. I'm perplexed priorities here, thinks good idea why.. confirm.

In 34 years life I've spared chicken pox, influenza, allergies. Hell, even common cold. Also never received flu shot, pox. I'm 16 years adult life also spared fever. 

Until mid April is. woke one day felt off. sick off. Anxious off. breathing heavier rapid. respiratory symptoms. fatigued, sore, bit off. (My apartment flooded two days prior, thought little stressed usual) masked went work. symptoms continued say something's off. sent home day. 30 minutes later I'm home, fever 101.1 excruciating pain. spine felt like fire radiating pain fire limb. Let's forget constant head ache. 6 days straight high fever. highest temperature 102.6, couldnt even stand straight. felt though stabbed gut attempt stand. Again, SOA/respiratory symptoms constant radiating pain everywhere including abdominal cavity.

So here's kicker. SARS-cov-2Ab soon ready testing. lab offered live family presumptively ""exposed"" us lab testing.

What three common? Us three symptomatic weeks. Us three also tested negative X 2 covid pcr nasal swabs. Yet ""covid"" antibodies used control test hundreds elders weekly basis. 

This concerned phlebotomist lab assistant still absolutely answers health department stopped testing overall. Yet gladly hand hundreds swabs communities skilled nursing facilities implement non contract testing lab staffed 88 employees. Tonight entered roughly 50 patients covid swab orders already 3 negative results prior. 

What's goal here? need outlet. breaks heart see woman stuck starting blank wall 14 days neighbor fever uti turned septic returning hospital. God forbid bring knitting needles yarn. **Contaminated yarn, oh my**
This heartbreaking frustrating. elders held will, unable feel sun, sadly families. elders left die alone. Same, we’re supposed back office September. us working home fine. US Pandemic response boils kid lying grades.

Your mom can't sign tutoring thinks awesome. hidden problem festers. opinion downvoted?? Moses go Mt Sinai? worried breathing virus in, look filters whatever mask wearing. cloth masks, ordered Merv 13 sheets cut filters. also use half-face respirators p-100 filters. looks like prices settled Amazon those. Best luck you! guy responded literally said ""completely squash"". Meaning gone, caput, eradicated. 

I suggest look definition must understand 3 weeks 3 weeks regardless timeline 3-4 years press pause.

Not all. 3 weeks far valuable start, transmission low virus be, theoretically, eradicated. point New Zealand case point.  discrimination/stereotyping actually. racism lol. agree point carry papers, think restrictions stricter suggest. think considering claustrophobia condition make ok wear mask. Claustrophobia fear tight spaces, don’t think wearing mask qualifies. excuse people wearing masks lot people suddenly get diagnosed claustrophobic. small minority could possibly issue, somebody feeling anxious uncomfortable wearing mask doesn’t give permission possibly put people risk. 

The ADA exempt people wearing masks, I’m sure claustrophobic people would cite excuse wearing mask. Getting papers therapist slippery slope. . don’t even think asthma seen reasonable exemption professionals. think people actually qualify wear mask. 

If say it’s ok wear mask papers ton anti-mask selfish people going find condition doctors note excuse them. wouldn’t press anyone papers it, also wouldn’t encourage either wrong people take advantage.  That's pretty insensitive, paint people broad brush? Sure, Texas governor anti mask, 80% country voted Clinton 2016, sure trump loving, anti mask, covid deniers? virus control governor overrode local guidances. mention could take precautions still infected. many stories heard teenagers bringing virus home families? healthcare workers fell victim, ones knew danger, took precautions, still got infected? get deserved too? medical profession, lack empathy compassion, condemn entire region like ""their government failed them""? everyone like covid Karens see /r/publicfreakout. shed tear die, literally know nothing people mentioned article gloating getting comeuppance. disgusting, reevaluate line work still think ok look upon need care disdain think deserve suffer. mean, considering article says nothing political parties, think argument falls flat. know? Death exist 2020.  Southern California sucks right now. Covid day, mosquitos (and Covid) night. stay time. Expect number increase exponentially next 2 - 3 months. Even then, vaccine influenza makes virus virtual non threat get it. Covid doesn’t. Privilege never taught read ingredients food eat friend. I’m trying stir anything, many people come idea question food own. should. everyone knows, get it. However, fairly common knowledge western diet healthy Whatever saying 1%, know news always sensationalizing small blowing less intellectual believe happening everywhere. That's like saying US dumb Trump. problem staying home Alllll nukes England seeing easily 700 day ages. expect number go hell lot more. director trump puppet control comes out. USPS wide array government agencies. call 29 1/2. Texas governor's mandate semi-toothless due copious exceptions ambiguous wording. therefore half state ignoring without consequence want make snarky clever comment. want provide sort insightful take situation. want to... can't. I'm tired.

Tired locked home, every day, outside human contact. Tired staying home staying safe, watch others bars, beaches, nightclubs, venues. government comes news says, ""Cases up, staying safe. need keep staying inside continue longer."" think, ""I'm already staying inside hard can. wear mask walk block mailbox. Every object entered house last three months delivered. do?""

I look around see states saying, ""Ok, basically over, back work!"" case counts tell story genuinely, truly get back work continue rise. continuously increase risk at-risk family, taking every precaution, infected.

I hopes pinned vaccine; light see anywhere tunnel. real belief sufficiently available ere mid-2021. mere concept strict isolation point seems intolerable.

And see people enjoying themselves, working gainfully, generally living life, think, ""Well, COVID-19 get eventually."" know statistically speaking, probably won't. even does, they'll probably experience mild symptoms. Heck, huge chunk even realize they're actually sick they're infecting others.

It's Prisoner's Dilemma writ large. take generally benefit, cost society society. I'm guy Prisoner's Dilemma choosing society self getting shafted every turn it. Maybe guy's sucker, moral compass allow another choice.

Congratulations, America. We're First. winning feels like.  Basically, yes. Nothing changed. mask mandate effectively unenforceable Hi, people give shit.

What's happening seems here, people desensitised, numbers much cope with. Covid scary, scary AF, happens loss numbers rise gets harder harder see individual souls. 

Our numbers 'appear' quite low now, people feeling loss say 10 people hospital setting lot 800 day. 

Now, back months ago, heard 10 people died covid horrified, we're seeing 10 we're grateful, sad. 

Humans weird fuckers. Look ✌️

I'm speaking UK, trying get life going here.  anyone list meat plant brands outbreaks One indoor masks, outdoor, often moving, majority wearing masks.

Which think which? Prevention key. need prevent new infections. 

Masks work. know masks work.  need use masks. long don't, making serious effort prevent new infections.

When political leadership starts leading, telling people wear masks, ... new infections start slowing down.  then, won't. infants can’t airways covered safely. stupid end bell curve. Everything known reported India, terms lockdown-control (lack of), testing-capacity (lack of), poverty, people-density share numbers, problems isolation, well fact chase health-personnel away sticks certain parts country.

This exactly news. least Apple 1000% made America!! Samsung North Korea spy company you’re either idiot traitor both. proper semantic versioning,

MAJOR version changes make incompatible API change

MINOR version add functionality backwards compatible manner, and

PATCH version make backwards compatible bug fixes ""Instead boring 'New Corona Virus Deaths' metric, tracking 'People Died Coronavirus Multiple Times,' pleased announce number near zero, drop zero *very soon* folks, soon, Homeland Security officers clean things Chicago."" -Trump, probably could explain many people asymptomatic? climate change again.

Now longer deny happening, they've moved ""no big deal"". alone end life?? really sucks. Testing hard get place unless symptoms super serious get test told assume it. Americans wearing one anyways. occasional dumbasses however. told stay home recieved universal basic income Thanks followup Nice thanks. Going maybe try longer graph. Yeah considering US population risk factor, anyone working home put risk, pretty much anyone could quit  Man fuck country. Tennessee, Texas Listen experts, even qualified experts. Well parents stupid enough send kids summer camp hope get nasty dose virus friend told forcing every single hospital America report deaths COVID deaths, skewing numbers make thing seem worse really is. also told virus trademarked meaning man made lab China population control. stopped talking convo. Apologies, mean imply Americans think alike generalisation. know plenty rational thinkers. 

It certainly seems though, ever, U.S. underlying culture science denial, combined unjustified arrogance, really exist rest developed world. yes, rest world taking note.

I honestly feel bad guys heads screwed on. long ago U.S. viewed great place live. go paid me. says lizard person. I'm fine multiple doses Imagine believing privatized hospitals Grand Conspiracy seize money falsifying COVID data. 

While also believing need keep health care privatized. 

Or somehow Deep State infiltrating hospitals, despite Greedy Old Projectionists controlling branches gov t? Holy shit, almost exactly brother trying argue yesterday. like would lying number deaths?! claimed can't trust news, Google search, anything internet, even scientific research. virus isnt airborne lol. Unless someone sneezes face 10cm away, sure.

It spreads contact yeah, washing hands coming contact people pretty effective method. However stand fact due low number tests america coupled high asymptomatic rate leads believe considerable amount people disease cdc say. 

That good point though applies daily reported figures. 

This study different.

When researchers specific apply random sampling/testing techniques selection bias result asymptomatic limited testing. 

This design specifically used estimate unknown population prevalences utilize well established statistical techniques measure everything deer populations smoking habits. huh? Wasn’t downvoting you. Thanks providing link. Every step step closer Masks, social distancing, WFH (for can). stay home still fortitude winter, flu non-issue. Hopefully enough situation minimize risk everyone else. mean tell choice pants effect virus spread large public gatherings? It’s UK based vaccine tested UK first. 

Also US recruiting trials well. It’s it’s badly quick results. tried UK first handling outbreak well enough data coming slowly they’re bringing countries especially poor job containing virus like Brazil, South Africa, U.S. doesn’t really get enforced either Tragic. I’m currently living Dallas. Legitimately feels like politicians contest see beat NY. give details? Nope, company worked made us work home wasn’t issue. fully prepared quit mostly work extra money. Nice meltdown date, World Health Organization (WHO) declared 2 diseases officially eradicated: smallpox caused variola virus (VARV) rinderpest caused rinderpest virus (RPV)

So suppose good point many diseases don’t need eradicated become far less threat health degree changes way conduct daily lifestyles. There's too, sure lot people working home going full Mad Men right now. 1) time, believed symptomatic individuals coul spread virus.

2) Since think asymptomatic people spread virus, seemed unnecessary everyone wear aask.

3) feared people would go out.and buy tons masks short supply needed first responders deal symptomatic individuals knew could spread disease.

The recommendation wear masks made 3 points. Point 3 isolation could look like like, context not. later learned point 1 incorrect, recommendation changed based new information. Feds take again. correct. I'm curious see get blocked to??? Keep strong definitely hero too!  Lol started back ID2020 lol think that's triggering people. check website work medical field people day claim cannot breath mask on. interacting clear suffer claustrophobia. interesting. Jesus, rest peace. horrible fucked up, wtf wrong fucking country?! Good them, guess. I'd rather wait find vaccine side effects, personally, I'm Russian Elite. guess really much mask mandate it? treat cancer heart disease gravity deserves.

As cancer researcher MD aiming oncologist, agree. welcome fast food open arms absolutely NOTHING provide poor families sources healthy nutrition food deserts. can't even bother tax sources unhealthy nutrition even though places *enormous* burden healthcare system basically transfers cost directly American I'd argue majority people story losing least one family member, friend, acquaintance heart disease cancer. 

People know people who've died cancer/heart disease lifetime 80 million deaths cancer/heart disease. COVID reach even developed new tradition coughing other's mouths every morning idea long immunity lasts.

Sort irrelevant. Even antibodies die months, still significant memory B/T response. nearly respiratory viruses, even second infection occurs, often thwarted prior symptoms body able mount response much quickly. part swine flu deadly. H1N1 strains several decades ago protected many elderly wound deadly kids older adults. virus first year heavy hitter, dies drastically. Otherwise every new virus would one add pile. We'd stacking deaths deaths deaths, 1918 flu would still making rounds killing 50 million every year two. get *reinfected* virus, typically got extra large dose immune system fight right away. number extra large doses transferred COVID would really minimal. see drastic decreases deaths feels like whataboutism.

Maybe whataboutism, also realism. COVID scary people new, point deadly we've still got much bigger wolf barn, dude sticking around year year. perspective death risk insanely skewed right now. 60 gained weight gotten less healthy quarantining, increased chance death significantly would getting COVID.

Try cancer researcher pinches pennies every study barely gets paid enough live, hear people say treat cancer/heart disease ""gravity deserves."" allocated $6 billion NCI last year, Trump even tried cut that.

What's unfathomable warped everyone's perspective virus is. Yes, something it. Socially distance possible. Wear mask. Cut unnecessary trips. see elderly parents. way people carry talking maim life, make infertile, kill 10 million people, etc... little-to-no evidence that. large scale somatoform disorder people who've never actually conceptualized risk alive. yet, people believe even denied it. Fml people stupid. Thank too! distance learning since work covid hall. Even kids don’t get sick ... workers will. Although polled doctors many mention homeschooling too. Many also said children depend nutrition need go back. also said children subjected abuse experiencing abuse time school available them. personal thing. I’ll distance learning family position so. meant schools everyone. Go Californian New York school. They’re 1/4 entire nations population lol. don’t think studies show average school staff member’s political affiliations. Also, meant teachers. They’d imply God isn’t real, multiple genders, talk current president. exact position, put foot said going come anymore. Luckily wasnt fired. time make difficult decisions. NY last hit 200 deaths late May. NJ last hit mid May. States like Massachusetts Michigan hit total couple times April early may far regular thing. states never hit mark. sad badly failed handle situation we're seeing new records now. God delusional. That's exactly someone creating vaccines implant tracking devices would say! Wow smart Life comes fast. It’s wake call smokers. quit well bit actually flu stick around? always humans infecting humans back forth across world? Thanks letting know. See below. way Thanks letting know. See below. would think 1:13.3333333

because estimated 40 million state California (residence, many unaccounted Census 2020 done report yet) 3 divided 40 That’s limitation testing capacity accurate representation infection growth Dozens even hundreds reinfections would immaterial, however. Prevalence low face many millions infections worldwide would suggest odds low societal concern. wondering Grandma new hole front door.


Wait second shirt

no shoes

no mask

no service lockdown also prevents flu deaths. Hundreds thousands year. dont necessarily disagree. one point try make mandatory early got much push back anti maskers felt rights taken away backtracked next day go person would make working way less would make working...great strategy. Dragging work like badge honor infect every person around us.  Look respect fact it’s religious thing

Mississippi truck this. best vaccination rates results US one point least. West Virginia far behind either. No, implies think they're ""stories"". Lol. cost 90k year family 3 live Mississippi . high standard living considering average rent 2 br apartment Mississippi $700. Asking important questions. Hard hitting news. Could worse. Great White touring again. another 1 month break like 2 weeks. Wow look numbers coming down... lies White House... Today, PSA news fucktards. Jesus People die everyday anyway new york here, still think a) antibody prevalence b) masks. think even opened bars dining reduced capacity spike bad was.

california, florida texas basically going went march/april. lockdowns work number cases stay small enough contact trace everyone. otherwise, there's probably certain % population needs get infected virus slow own. Here’s peer-reviewed scientific paper Imperial College capacity limits UK US healthcare systems exceeded many times over. effective mitigation strategy examined, leads single, relatively short epidemic (case isolation, household quarantine social distancing elderly), surge limits general ward ICU beds would exceeded least 8-fold optimistic scenario critical care requirements examined. addition, even patients able treated, predict would still order 250,000 deaths GB, 1.1-1.2 million US. incredible people thread cower idea positive news comes virus true, sadly many people refuse believe case. Got heavily downvoted saying thing another thread. Yeah, 40% eligible voters even vote, 30% Trump voters, 30% Clinton voters 40% even care country. hear argument often, overall Americans got wanted, primarily 'nothing + Trump', resulted Trump. Sorry rant, European really fed American politics remarks like ""...but technically Hillary won"", bring anything table. hope next voter turnout higher. know reporting doctors' statements many people leaving hospital serious issues. fact reported widely mean happening. know causes it. Sever pneumonia causes lung damage. Covid causes clotting, leads tissue damage clots lodge. causes strokes, heart attacks, organ damage cause amputations limbs. straight told boss working office since easily work home. 

Did get fired?
If so, living $0/week since can't get unemployment quitting reason? Change locks divorce he’s gone since clearly doesn’t care wellbeing.  Oh ffs Exactly, COVID-19; precautions warranted. know feel, brought similar way. love country stands lost way. longer ""what countrymen"" instead ""what myself"". mean ffs name country says united, remember last time united anything keep downvoting previous comment. please. I've confused get go talked about. I've 3 babies time I've pregnant discussed length dangerous flu pregnant woman. get flu shot yearly matter like convince hammered point home anyways. last baby got influenza 36 weeks brutal need hospital, credit flu shot. Point being... would assume Covid dangerous pregnant woman flu?? undercounted fatalities grows. 

In Trump's ideal America, Covid-19 fatalities counted September: ""The virus lost potency longer danger.""

""If stop counting covid fatalities, change"" “I wish would step ledge, friend.” I’m sorry, didn’t realize masked person incapable moving away. plenty unmasked people don’t act like described. It’s rare concerned about.

But matter, still wouldn’t make difference. told employees kick people without mask, would increase odds actual yelling getting close other, also potential lead violence.

Lowe’s policy sound.  read this: fade time, know immunity Yelp still exists?

People heard them? Yo! Yeah Jones sucks. ""We mask police"". Third world countries shitholes.. financial means.

You always try compare apples apples. Hm... almost like people conscious individuals capable learning past mistakes others. Especially raised them. exact carbon copy parents? Life moves on. Seems one problem here. let's also forget federal administration actively blocking NY building testing infrastructure time. propaganda Notice said “stories irresponsible behavior,” careful reader imply *I agree behavior irresponsible.* Describe symptoms well enough doctor who's well-meaning abuse drug that's life enabling some, there's shit heads degrees passing scripts. there's always too. top replaced business major medical background medical position. country ridiculous. Same. deploy networking hardware customers company wouldn’t even let building pick boss knew diagnosed autoimmune disease January. Even skeleton crew onsite. started mailing gear every time needed re-up drop off. We’ve WFH since March, intention forcing anyone back anytime soon.

My employer lot things wrong it, goddamn handle beautifully. leaves working getting people sick. faith. near 90% country believes Trump. He’s lost portion conservatives compared 2016 didn’t even win popular vote then. Trump wins year election hacked. Free? Last checked, paid taxes. think parents struggling virtual school young children. want cancel school, cancel it. Furlough school staff tell parents figure educate kids. 

Don’t tell one hour zoom day email week worksheets school.  Like r/politics, sub allow anyone views post doesn’t. lightning storm going on, go swimming? climb tall trees? go around waving golf club air? That's almost four months ago now. Four freaking months. four months ramp capacity get ready specifically kind thing happen.

If people took lockdowns seriously, necessary. We're (New Zealand) pretty much closed border situation. allowed enter country (due citizen receiving exemption immigration department) must stay quarantined hotel 14 days receive pretty comprehensive testing virus. cases isolation facilities, none general community.

At moment.

If case found community government outlined first step regional lock-downs. Pretty robust backup plan.

We got point hard lock-down. meet definition eradication definition unreasonable. Areas country (I care one live in) lock-down well. Masks protect well. extent unknown, help. Obviously someone infected they're coughing food/packaging going risk catching it. There's evidence anyone contracting virus causes COVID-19 touching food containers food packaging. evidence support transmission COVID-19 associated food. evidence food food packaging associated transmission coronavirus. respiratory illness. known transmitted exposure food food packaging. evidence get coronavirus disease (COVID-19) food food packaging. thing annoys 1) highly unlikely hospital test trauma patient COVID edge death, 2) even true, information *could still really really important.*

At first, doctors considering respiratory symptoms COVID. learned heart attacks strokes clots, kidney dysfunction, inflammatory syndrome children - doctors began noticing unexpected upticks trends. However...what turns COVID causing people pass out, turns passing reason car accident? still useful info have, like common causes death AIDS patients, still say death partially due AIDS, Kaposis TB, etc. Please read article commenting, talks fake FFP2, KN95, N95 sold Spain (and rest Europe) meet filtration standards EU. person risk (or healthcare worker) must protect FFP2 FFP3 wear face shield. narrative masks protect wearer false. article affects anyone purchased products list, including health care workers. Original budget year 4.7 people carry. get kids/meatheads talking conceal carry showing friends know it, cringe. I’m pro 2nd amendment. sometimes it’s ridiculous. live rural Utah MAYBE 5% peers/friends carry. outside U.S. think Americans don’t leave house without gun, that’s even close correct lmao Dangerous masks sale Europe.

The Valencian Institute Safety Health Work Generalitat produced guide masks protect us coronavirus

Are sure mask use protect coronavirus really protecting us? Masks become greatest protection Covid-19 vaccine arrives and, many Autonomous Communities already established mandatory, truth masks protect us. Valencian Institute Safety Health Work Generalitat produced guide masks protect us coronavirus.
Personal protective equipment Covid-19: non-compliant masks title document contains list 100 masks comply different reasons safety requirements must protect Covid -19.

""In face public health emergency caused Covid-19 due current shortage Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) virus regulatory CE marking, Ministry Industry, Commerce Tourism determined that, exceptional cases temporarily, certain cases PPE without regulatory CE marking based harmonized standards accepted, ""assures analysis, adding that"" generated appearance masks apparently similar FFP2 FFP3, large extent. China, sometimes cast serious doubts protective efficacy due difficulty verifying suitability respect currently accepted technical specifications. ""

The list presented guide made 95 masks expressly notified non-compliant alerts published official sources, public access. addition, second list added, 18 others, alerts also issued national level, yet published website Ministry Consumer Affairs. 100 masks protect us coronavirus: (list starts here) Exactly, people say flu mean bad cold. hours work row! good would decision making 24 hours continuous work?

it could fine, thank you, provided amphetamines allowed ;-) look conspiracy theories actually making people feel safer. 

9/11 inside job means likely happen bunch crazy people plane actually kill nearly 3000 people. 

Illuminati/NWO means people actually control world instead likely option one means anything happen. 

And COVID hoax means well COVID-19 hoax therefore something worry about. fighting illness loss making profitable hospitals? Remember time went war around 3,000 deaths? someone US: 3. Pity following recommended safety protocols, disgust don't, horror entire situation. 🙄 clear, face coving personal protection, community protection. 

If want total personal protection need hazmat suit.  makes mad. lot people world, especially third world countries, would anything get vaccine. saddens ppl take granted think part ridiculous conspiracy. :( Plenty security places hire off-duty cops. love extra money would really good dealing nonsense. I've copied article link headline calendar reference ""unlikely"" article turns wrong. continue assume get hard proof contrary. step direction, baby step. I'm gonna wait big person steps invest good news. number videos i've seen air monitors next mouths show air quality changes stick sensor mask mind blowing. One congressman senator believe. insanely dumb. Ofc air going change breathe out. Thats breathe out. would fuck virus hard. Whereas, outside looking in, Democrats better still extremely flawed. would considered right centre Ireland. lesser two evils two horse race there, guess.

And care much, honest. Every country issues deal with. like Americans worry much whether Fianna Fáil, Fianna Gael, Greens, Sinn Féin, etc power Ireland. can't compete Russia Olympics athletes still competing. ""With great power come great responsibility"".

Social media become new gatekeepers information dissemination jobs, society decline. People can't deal information floating around able filter crap.

The safe-harbour provisions scrapped social media *communications channels*, *content platforms*. see guy linking data proof see responding 'no wrong' over. Seems like maybe might something! told reopen economy. confusing mean whole world got together private 5g email server , lol hospital gets 13k medicaid per covid patient. Im absolutely saying conspiracy, overcrowded ICU's honestly speak themselves. can't deny fact hospitals financial motive diagnose patients COVID-19. may lead slight increase diagnoses, still drop bucket compared number real cases. think completely denying valid point COVID deniers may used discredit arguments Ahhhhh. Folk think I'm claiming death stats fake. No, no, no. STATS REAL. said helpful.

An explanation. New York's CFR stupidly high, like 8% something. suggests 8% folk get virus die. true. CFR high testing focused symptoms. inflated.

Folk looking states like Cali, Texas, Florida applying CFR states, project many CURRENT CASES result deaths. I'm trying say correct all, CFR states MUCH lower right testing different demo. 

Now CFR may well rise coming weeks hospitals become overwhelmed, CFR rates state based AGE, whether SYMPTOMS, based folk tested (i.e. folk tested NY March vs. June) much able accurately guess Florida, Texas, Cali's death rate look like.

Because right HUGE numbers coming states terms confirmed cases. seeing DEATHS thus far. want know expect stay way, change somewhat, change radically.

I moreso said ""if detailed information could accurately project many recently infected die.""

Make sense? even infection numbers still going alarming rate. going months number people need medical assistance going stop growing. get pretty bad.. California's steady 120 deaths day months now, never really went reopening (huge mistake Gov Newsom + fact lot Republican counties). It’s second wave, still first wave since current administration fucked response it’s exploded again, second wave hits we’re fucked. It’s going get much worse gets better. epidemiology word wave used describe infection rate looks om paper people understand statistics medicine. helpful explaining disease roll infect bunch people, retreat come crashing again, perhaps mutated, still disease. 


There preset pattern infectious disease follow outside one several waves . definitions outside: increase infection rates, crest decrease nothing low enough distinct another increase, wave.

It need designations like 1.2 whatever anything. simple description curve looks like people understand plotting numbers graph.

On top that, fear dad’s life every fucking day. serious health issues get COVID19, could easily imagine needing ventilator himself. know it’s selfish, I’m fed people risking dad’s life nothing actively trying save theirs. go public unnecessarily, fuck you. without mask... cannot even begin describe level hatred feel you.

Pretty sure people know allowing United States citizens stay there. expensive trip never took. I'm going argue someone believes 0% risk unchanging facts regards COVID19.

If bothered read change suggest long protesters wearing masks outside, risk spreading covid.

to suggests experts think little risk mask outside.

Big difference explains condemned.

Edit: I'll add this. 

No one condemns sun exposure skin cancer mean risk getting skin cancer sun exposure. Even precautions limiting exposure, applying sunscreen seeking shade small risk developing skin cancer. 

Believing risk leads people outraged still got sick despite precautions. Understanding small risk leads people understand unlucky. asthma hard breath sometimes time really understand Yeah... merciless triaging start moment now. mean know people always broke say things like (well pay rent live city, might well enjoy it).

Damn ripoff, even pay $75. They're free here. 12 years ago vaguely remember easing cravings nothing special, still smoked, made nauseous. Lol see gas station next selling them, ran hella quick tho They'll billions soon enough. Best quote I've seen long time: ""the stock market graph rich people feelings” go healthcare works risk individuals first, lottery that. totally scary, boyfriend wait months see doctor even visit, ( sept 1) biopsy maybe mohs procedure..in october.

you right level sketch here. wonder actually wrote it. equations train wreck btw. looked EM ones abused feel like call police authors violating laws physics. mean like heart attack cancer? totally agree think retail shops open *especially* several outbreaks among employees like one mentioned. insane. 

If people could wear damn masks responsible incredibly likely issue. refuse even step foot retail shop. need clothes toiletries badly I'll order online. reason retail shops need open. even know anecdotes counts evidence. understanding that, anecdote, positive patient tested negative later tested positive. Sometimes months testing negative.

Our two theories reinfection initial infection resurfacing.

What's interesting, though, long test negative, we've seen viral shedding. months. indicator virus cleared body. Even symptoms. Even test location evidence virus.

There cases patient clearly undeniably it.

An example couple vacationers either visiting Hawaii Hawaii. wife hospitalized tests positive. husband hospitalized double lung interstitial pneumonia hallmark COVID-19 repeatedly tests negative again. think finally landed positive test week two later.

The problem virus go wants testing right location, difficult sometimes find it.

Fecal testing accurate experience.

And that's easy COVID patient hospitalized diarrhea symptom. diarrhea unending, insert tube anus diarrhea pours out.

Fecal samples days. Right. Saw presser WH this. convinced believe it. “ going go quickly...” yeah whether works not, fuck that. RGV resident here, think lot folks kind forgot riots took headlines. people already back work restaurants offering dine-in. South Padre island opened hell broke lose couple weeks later. drive around town can't tell ""shelter place"". Mainly enforceable due Governor Abbott's orders supersede local orders. wife worked since March infuriating watch what's happening. 

I really believe people simply can't understand idea pandemic ""disaster slow motion"". We're use typical tropical storm hurricane sweeping thru everyone stays home couple days. gonna last year least, region patience something sort timeline. obvious everyone high risk region. High poverty, high rates obesity diabetes, multi-generational homes signals gonna bad, May SIP lifted everyone felt like longer issue. 

Testing complete disaster. Took two weeks results. 

I honestly hope Abbott gets voted out, striped local leaders ability respond effectively rising numbers. imagine SIP means lost sales tax worsen coming fiscal nightmare. Actually way DeSantis Ducey acting I’d say it’s going lead (D) landslide. 

And I’m (R). Georgia surprise? Reddit phds told deaths down, happened???  can't tell tongue cheek comment. insane. It'll go here. shhhh little bill gates. want first dibs vaccine. Seriously. STOP setting records? know take pride highest numbers things, COME ON. Good thing Mitch crew trying pass immunity laws businesses employees can't sue lives endangered!  far there’s much reported this. tummy issues become long-term problem her, wouldn’t blame COVID specifically mid 20s women often begin inflammation issues. Digestive issues often tied inflammatory diseases (everything irritable bowel disease, rheumatoid, even allergies). sounds scary inflammation usually dangerous GI inflammation annoying/painful managed. means immune system bit overzealous. There’s lot interesting new research started focus women inflammatory issues. COVID sort infection could trigger, usually it’s stress. issues definitely flare work. 
  
So don’t get worried. Hopefully one-time tummy bug issue goes well! even sticks around, seems unlikely would lethal (as digestive issues). Today's number highest one I've seen while. think lot stems feeling helplessness. feel like agency, like ignored - press, government, co-workers. they're shouting rooftop matter please notice them. easiest way get attention anti-mask statements. masks. never masks. people feel powerless exercising one small amount control think still lives.

Maybe tell them, ""Hey, matter. that's want keep safe, I'm wearing mask,"" help see they're fighting establishment, friends, families, co-workers. I'm sorry 1 upvote give you. said makes perfect sense. 

I made way unemployment working. second called go back work, went. Even though hate it, even though could furloughed 6 weeks. 

But people work come back yet. work ethic, pride, perfectly acceptable sit around collect $600. 

I agree people need help, jobs there, willing work - even ""beneath"" you. People work rewarded refusing work right now. would guess need distinguish immunity/resistance exact virus immunity/resistance mutated version virus. first case, yes, recovery first attack result improved immunity/resistance virus. long extent, know probably different different people anyway. Another question whether virus still hiding somewhere body waiting resistance go away reinfect you. far whether resistant mutated version virus, know probably likely mutated version came avoid defenses people developed previous version.  drop new cases coincides White House stopped allowing hospitals report CDC. new numbers falsely deflated. aware manipulation. safe yet: Give bottom 20%.

Once safe: Give top 0.2%. ""death zone"" deadlier OP title fatality rate potentially 6 times deadlier flu...AND infection rate 2.6%. read article also discusses infection tests antibody tests.

Do understand figure out, use antibody tests? Measles almost got eradicated, someone decided vaccinate went area measles. imagine happened next. taking blame got power. Yeah, point anti-maskers even supposed do?

And they're alone times, one teacher *still* responsible 500 kids. Moreover, school reopening plans eliminated playgrounds, reduced number kids lunchroom, gotten rid gathering auditorium, etc. shit enough situation need exaggerating it. expect keep uncomfortable mask day, spend one room, social distance learn?

The young kids (K-2) ones I'm least concerned about. keep masks that's they're told do. may one two per class flaunt rules, get sent home... like dress code violation. Classroom management nothing it.

What described, keeping mask kid social distance learn, nearly textbook definition classroom management. 

Instead focusing masks stay kids (which nowhere near impossible chore seem think maintain insult teachers) focused utter insanity packed thousands time concrete building recycled air *that allowed open windows* time knowing there's 100% chance someone knowingly sends positive COVID kid school go work day can't miss again. how, masks help, they're going eliminate spread. California testing COVID lagging since day one surprise numbers are. IMPORTANT number happening hospitals. COVID positive one thing infection severe, MAIN issue system simply handle workload hell breaks lose decisions made gets admitted treated sent home Wow So, masks not? Last checked almost every person protests wear masks. maskless, brainless, dickless, morons rallied indoors, without masks spread like wildfire. protests too. spread then. don’t claim shit. numbers do. also allowed wear kinds headwear classrooms. also allowed wear sunglasses, since makes communication harder. actually different.

I'm prerty divided topic honest. one hand become part religion, hand always part used distance east west long time. latter problematic actually living ""west"". countries much important topic, sometimes actually get raped wearing Niqab. Germany around 200-300 women estimated actually wear every day, forcing students wear would probably make life school harder, since easy thing pick on.

In end think probably better allowed wear school reduce mobbing improve communication, simply difficult topic. Trump already said wont accept november elections. no, going get much, much worse 200,000 dead. 2019, estimated 38,800 people lost lives to car crashes

That's 100 deaths per day (in US).

We're 10x number deaths per day coronavirus car crashes. allowed start taking seriously yet? That's concerning! marathoner know infected affected COVID-19 normal run killed them?

My daughter's neurologist told us last week category child would likely make got COVID-19. (She make anyway, want bring coronavirus home extremely careful.)

I'll try get oximeter! Hello fellow villain! This. really don’t understand face still people refuse wear mask. WHY??? Also pity assholes follow ghoulish political leaders' marching orders. Trump idiot. Fine. DeSantis, Ducey, Abbot. idiots. Fine. *But governor president idiot mean tells do!!!* 

The problem there's way sort followed safety protocols didn't. absolutely know people refused mask caught get ventilators, people masked caught get rejected ventilators. *That* okay. stock market /s one said ‘just’ 80’ days immune protection. Correct numbers easily. Hospitals getting reimbursed slightly per dollar spend Medicaid patients - get 84 cents per dollar spent - 250 liters per person per day probably quell bitching. guy cam Lowe’s said wife it, tome taking mask complaining it. sad needs said yes I'm thankful vaping helped quit still smoking regular cigs would much harder, able taper zero makes huge difference. Ok, guys serious, really think could actually that, like ever seen internet explorer, doesnt work. ‘Doctor he’s dying GSW’

/s Desanthrax don't. scenarios described [here](http://www.healthdata.org/covid/faqs#Scenarios). best guess is, flattening curve, flipped: there's smaller pool people infect later let peak higher earlier. (assuming low reinfection rate) guy blast outer space already. mean sure, presenting sort Corona Czar really anything different even results show is... great look. expect Bavaria Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Thüringen numbers, Hamburg, Berlin, NRW etc. decent comparisons imho. take advice stick it. need action, empty words skeleton knit sweater.

Period. 

You can’t ways unless claim there’s magical force stopped virus spreading protests. lately I’ve wondering ‘what’s point?’ read shit like I’m grateful dog cause honestly doesn’t feel like point. money goes development vaccines better.

Even give 100 billion vaccines, 100 billion easily remade completely reopening economy earlier rather later. Excellent description silly shit is! Never understood two mask wearing. Even spanish flu put masks toddlers covered babies. came home state rally. wear mask. June. worn mask unless whatever state visited demanded it. Even then. doubt wore mask. manslaughter ? came home business trip yesterday. Flew Southwest. people mask. less people correctly actually flight attendants.

People keep telling god exist protect them, yet fail believe! It’s almost possible did. 

The ifr wildly different depending getting infected. 

Have outbreak place everyone 45 under? 3-6 deaths per 10,000 infected. 

Have outbreak place everyone 70 up? 1,000 deaths per 10,000 infected. 

You can’t use deaths find real number cases. Yes no. Many protests people moving. unlikely people stay spot hours end. 

Yes it’s outdoors, lot congregating confined quarters extended periods time. 

But point, cringed came “protests didn’t increase spread” gave every person platform. still going limit nonessential dental work he’s pain we’re going hours. banned *in schools* grounds teacher can't job can't see faces students. ban also applies niqabs, hijabs.

Lots people would like ban outright everywhere Germany, prevailing legal opinion ban would unconstitutional. demand protection afforded Trump.

Australia we're generally wearing masks people gotten social distancing, since we've mostly outbreak initial lockdown (one densely populated states first explosion we've seen though, started).

Flu cases dramatically, something like thousands dozens, thing think could really drive plastic screens, instructions touch stuff, people bit cautious. seems pretty impactful, stores perhaps one core places flu spreading. guess though. 32 here... rate anything meaningful left time hit 60 wear mask everyday argument. said, find hard breathe sometimes. way make sense lungs weak exhale forcefully enough clear air around face (if makes sense?). Thankfully work allows set box fan shove face near second, I'm good. wish could find reliable mask built fan, ones see junk seems. war education intellectualism borne bitter fruit. Ofcourse depends many factors. numbers state confirmed cases used testing tools / method, ofcourse also 100%. Also test more, might get asyomptotic cases etc etc. One could spin many directions. Everything staying equal (which assume would say) assume deaths follow number confirmed cases - see otherwise. Everything else sounds like overanalysis me.

Tesla huge hold EV market doesnt matter Elon says, people still buy cars EV really buy that's fast, looks good, affordable. worry, go away. 

That true eventually. I'm getting tired.

You know what's really tiring? ventilator month. none, many. fact mainly HK government leads current risk. Given hits older people harder, I'd bet opposite that’s Elon, he’s quite open  That’s big ask employees making minimum wage. true wasn’t conclusion. read credible studies before, always list possible correlation vs causation issues. reason lost lately. Ok one? guess trump using calculations “equal”? safety net survive months? America certainly handled pandemic poorly, keeping everything closed solution. that’s Elon, he’s quite open Go big Texas. There’s much room dealing stranger walk drill face without warning broad daylight. city violent many people carry guns around Correct. Three masons lodge admitted hospitals covid list heart failure cause death. took old people covid positive hospital sent nursing homes tell anyone covid status....  I'm sorry. hope realize next thing get away.  Yet current administration keeps pointing testing reason numbers infected keeps increasing. ICU beds filling too? Still many diseases spread around sub-Saharan Africa need dealt with. Even simple parasites killing many people every month. Thank goodness people like Gates give darn. That's still death caused Covid 19. Hot press “BNO NEWS”. Keeping America's cities becoming complete warzone shitholes? DARE That's article says. read it? I’m Tesla owner, probably purchasing second one Elon continues road.

Ok USA. already win. stop now. win again.... yes, “win”. misclassification argument nonsensical one big reason: even look cause death simply look number deaths given day year, every single day marked increase every previous year. explanation person give explain many extra people dieing every single day? Yeah appears main issue many USA states, reopened first curve went down, quickly. Dude: global pandemic disease literally human resistance to, disease attacks entire body creating thousands blood clots permanently destroy functionality even people appear survive without symptoms. person Covid escapes without permanent damage kind - lung, kidney, brain. kill people, spreads easily efficiently. hide like ninja two weeks, infecting others entire time, symptoms appear. cure. known treatment - throw stuff wall see sticks.

This useful like car. permanent disability best (lowered lung capacity kidney failure), death worst, CURE TREATMENT.

Nothing said makes sense whatsoever compared facts.

I can't even comprehend coming from. Covid literally 'worst case scenario' studied microbiology college. literal catastrophe.

How understand this?

Incurable. Untreatable. resistance. killing disabling young people.

Fuck, dude. fuck. goes top. corporations maximize profit give shit human beings that’s threatened. would have. would always spread, always spread. highly infectious, hard manage. compare places shut business US ones opened early ones still haven’t opened yet, growth rate similar.

 See june 16 here: Well fuck else would actually STAY here?

I see either us leaving either.

So want nipple clamps, riding crop, *both*? True! mom said it’s hospitals inflating cases make money. lives Florida called “bunch baloney.” told story friend calling hospital check someone accident hospital said Covid. said hospital Florida claimed 82 cases Covid, friend looked it’s really 8. I’m upset. raised smarter that. common claims virus? would love see origin is. happened attending GenCon year anyway THANK GOD cancelled shit. 

Con Crud already bad enough without 'rona. Holy hell idea. continually escalating straight civil war. Unless something incredible happens reverse madness, don’t see way it. I’m dying inside. really grasped single word said.  Thank sure lots. Hopefully wearing mask. would helpful situation. Exactly! rate hospitals reach capacity heavily affected governmental policies. simplified example, Florida would seeing huge spikes cases they’re seeing right remained locked whole time. type attitude prevalent many conservative talk shows. Except flu thing, hear anymore except talk Fauci said something along lines way back when. Hi Sewer Babies! north Korea trying find vaccine? Lol America sucks handling pandemic. may started China, death counts would lot lower people actually took seriously. wrong several levels. 

1. Sense since
2. Kids don’t quarantine? parents idiots also don’t quarantine. 
3. country considering restrictions? Nope, Germany closed schools day schools open require distancing masks. Source: I’m German. many countries globe (no flat) same. No, America isn‘t existing country world...
4. evidence assumptions kids safe home? Sience based please, outta ass. people ""calling out"" PCr tests exactly like you, though. idea ia, never done i, literally nothing context quote saw facebook.

Do *actual* concerns, memes russian propaganda. There's nothing fix you...  One time walking Walmart heard woman say dad died Corona. happened dad I'd fucking wreck weeks. Fuck Coronavirus deniers   Ouch, yeah that's rough hear. Exactly. current situation disaster, can't imagine could happen first line workers masks (instead ""just"" enough) first weeks pandemic... 

And I'm speaking globally (here France many critics toward government imposed masks soon enough). even offering much way hazard pay? Lol  new restaurants going open middle pandemic that's killing restaurants? might right longer timescale, people need jobs way support NOW.  WINNING! I'm trying asshole since America refuses wear masks, 20 thousand dead per day actually better 1k deaths per day. wont bore math, preferred scenario, America back track actually lot better standardized tests 3 years. 1200 dead per day 10 years more. dont sad read this. Bastard. Personal responsability versus enforcement : wear motorcycle helmet, may harm society whole. cost money beside personal (and familial) harm.

That's way truer european countries government largely subsidize young people education health costs : government somewhat invest young people.

Edit : addendum - follow laws/rules/common sense somewhat waste government invested money

Edit2 : ""communism"" fact state decide education/trade choose; want live, whom, want read/see/believe. likely it’s spread several large metropolitan agrees, cases New York localized NYC. California hospitals aren’t overly stretched beyond capacity. Yet. even CDC think issue one would think would.... look new evidence perhaps study it. RemindMe! August 30 Ah yes 'ol ""well bad worry it"" excuse.

Gonna keep scrolling see get bingo:

* hospitals claiming every death covid death

* flu still kills people every year

* something anti-vax

* testing much

* blame protesters!  13% uptick normal mortality rate big deal grand scheme things. 

It’s tragic would like minimize death bound happen.

Did think masks going stop deaths? Fear mongering bullshit. Mask wearing isn’t even pervasive Europe (at least Germany UK) anymore since cases low, people partying indoors outdoors. hundred people hanging outdoors NYC issue, it’s going months. understanding reimbursed (up 20% via CARES Act). article mentions get Reimbursement - 84 cents per dollar spent vs 70 cents. Reimbursed - paid more. spend get - getting reimbursed 84 cents per patient (up 70).   

As far understand there’s huge shortfall payments hospitals receive Medicaid. God damn. point needing everyone either monsters saint. fucking HATE country. South Carolina, [don't food stamps unless income less 1,307 month single person. almost see rest world see... cost insulin driven PBOs isn’t factor Ditmer'd sure complete is:  
  - Based current stats: 75% people get corona, beat problem.

- Many people test pos corona even beat die reason, get counted corona death actually ton fear mongering news 24/7. bet good portion feel threatened, sadly. Unlike you, morals won’t allow buy someone uses workers, helped make wealthier, worst possible way. 

This article may recent, way worker injuries treated hasn’t changed.  Um...most South America Southern Hemisphere. Also testing wasn’t anywhere near widely available back March April. true number infections New York significantly higher positive case count confirmed testing.  also true California drastically. makes even stupid. It’s like bad toddler warned something gets mad gets time out. That's also said help government stupid leader handling this. every american smart stayed home government would bowing feet. whole racism country really boil resources. Racists feel losing power minorities. It’s game money another name. Racists want handouts. many people country think government piggy bank personal wants, rather force better entirety nation. Ironically, it’s group people going welfare fraud.  Sweden third day row less 10 deaths Covid. can't find right now, physician Twitter said something along lines, think disease epithelial tissues transmit like respiratory virus. typical respiratory virus (e.g., flu) may give pneumonia bad cases, means likely ventilator best option goes route. That's early panic ventilator counts on, less prepared lot stuff turned needing, like 30% severe COVID patients severe kidney damage.

COVID instead attacks cells express ACE2 protein, [found lungs, arteries, basically whole spreads droplets/aerosols like respiratory illness, miss lot effects (and necessary treatments, e.g., anticoaulants, dialysis, neurological effects, etc) focus lungs. iirc, get fined three chances. People world take imodium fix meth withdrawal symptoms, mean fuck take high blood pressure.

Seriously like people think pop pill want covid well magically disappear.

Edit : someone check covid growth rates countries often malaria ""They're sick old people.. culling herd good! Ubermensch!"" think one biggest problems good portion population thinks last civil war good old days. Iowa. captain leaves ship first, boards next one immediately crashes too. rinse repeat  havent caught it...the mask wise choice make.

However, recovered, like me, immune longer carrier.

I pack mask case someone wants feel better though, make feel safe putting on. Wont damn thing cant catch spread it. Fauci one person taken seriously since day 1. saddens WH silenced much. Fauci way delivering news send spiraling anxiety attack, almost like dipping toes test water. He's never rushed talk ""doom gloom"" statistics, knows address statistics information need know palatable way. applaud him. restaurants rely ~60% 70% occupancy keep doors open.

They're ones.

Maybe Amazon Prime start serving food, Bezos love that. freedom compared countries.

You must read news last... uhm.. 60 years? Heck read news past months.

Also, sentences like facilities usually nearby sometimes necessary press native runners service Microlock hut local telegraph office.

No one gives fuck.

It'll take one caddy infected whole place fucked. Granted members 60+ would think would care lil bit. take risk order protect freedom, claiming healthy dose fear isnt warranted RIGHT NOW, think sense fear might persist well future plain stupid. cannot guess future holds, unfolds dont fuck rest us think outsmarting system. Didn’t Fauci claim possible second wave concern fall causing people perhaps drop guard summer? Didn’t also claim repeatedly people going get infected touching Contaminated surfaces touching face yet see infections airborne? coronavirus one form another around least 100 years, shouldn’t know already?  Even 30% deaths false, we'd highest death toll world. 50% false, we'd second highest 70,000 deaths. 

Like fucking world living sensible reaction ""It's lie."" Google oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. 

Basically, way red blood cells carry oxygen, one oxygen molecule binds, two add quickly, fourth one slowly. 

When we've got plenty oxygen board, small changes really affect us, cause symptoms. However, oxygen levels hit threshold, drops further, drops *fast* two oxygen molecules rapidly dissociate haeme molecule.

No oxygen bonded haeme oxygen transport cells cell death person death. Lung disease comorbidities shift threshold make vulnerable, underlying physiology still there. think imagine president that, america, keep us amazed. USA occupies 2% surface earth. Broaden view. annoying chick diner makes everything her. be.

They might able run ever-increasing series flawless sprawling conspiracies, least might able form consensus policy run good national election. Right? Utterly unpanicked one somehow lol got dumbfounded sheer amount Lots retirement plans stock market, it’s spare cash rich. likely it’ll plateau due testing bottleneck.

They cannot humanly expand testing exponential rate like virus Dude please put hand people walk towards you. Say “I’m allowed get within 6 feet you”.

Um dosage much? insurance, I've never pay flu shot US. Insurance companies (most) seem cover wholly. 

The article outlines $40 set price vaccine. ""About flu vaccine""-- that's insurance would pay it, private citizens, etc. 50 million mark. 

Obviously cant afford insurance, $40 getting hosed. 

Ideally, COVID treated urgency deserves, insurance companies corporations step provide shot little cost, regardless insurance status. Hopefully able get Walgreens CVS insurance free (like $40 flu shot), govt subsidize vaccinations people without (unlike currently treat Flu).

We'll see, here's hoping.

(Edited lightly *explain harder* people thought 1. pro-US health system, 2. anti-free vaccine) Yeah like, people upvoting piece s... Oooooooh! virus hot spots across country. hospitals across country still laying people off. Yes, really make sense, happening. Quit possible.

In France, depending city, mask usage ranges non-existent (where infections reported far) common (the former ""red zone""). Also, week, masks legally compulsory closed public spaces. movie looking John Q Yes may true. responding statement “ fact ...has never observed...” done North Korea did.  test all, magically wont any. Uh, no. Number Friend Good comment?

Nice media outlets spewing propaganda, contradicting scientists discernable reason. 

The interesting thing there: largest German tabloid BILD tried run campaign Virologist (discoverer SARS-CoV-1 Virus among things) Prof. Drosten, largely failed Drosten huge audience due regular podcast government mostly argues around facts (even disagreements consequences like school openings etc.) media take either.

Really fascinating see - especially compared power BILD years back, could set agenda. (While course hard compare - Corona Drosten goes back lab research, he's politician needs positive publicity media) said (200k) unfriend people attacked personally saying that. conservatives understand ad hominem attacks. works. positive news Wisconsin mask mandates major metro areas. I'm hoping Evers waiting days new justice seated least attempting mask order. Oh boy, see contract tracing back early days. Hang let find (One rural Republican counties existence.) never met American ashamed stupid. Try calling people stupid, care it. Read. The. Thread.

Antibodies barely decrease 80 days, cases antibodies initially low, **increased.** leads think continue decay slowly.  ask idiots claim fake -whe president inner circle get tested multiple times every day.... Trump's strategy work... R u guys voting gop? voted leadership. Simply amazing six months pandemic still ppe shortage, notging pure failure federal government fuck would assume haven’t asked questions?

That’s big “not asking questions” albatross you’re wearing, bud. Honestly, time brought relative hospital already infected anyway. could economy. north spending money place, masks. want economy, wanted fight. Thank You! New Pal here. I'm glad son old enough school yet, bode well everyone. know forefront school reopening. parents reacting? Damn dude, that's rough. Glad could get back work. think state media much negatively connotated international level. agree orthen2112 misleading call german ""öffentlich-rechtlichen rundfunk"" state media. pretty nitpicky, think distance scale off. Rio Grande City 2-3 hours Laredo Corpus, respectively, 4 hours away San Antonio.

I agree general point though.  anti maskers love pretend one's wearing them, despite people everywhere go.

It must hard tell office Moscow. Thanks, little positivity greatly appreciated. seems nothing negative news days. one cares... kick globalist father got tested Covid. He's obese, diabetic COPD. guess gotta pray God believe it. fed (assuming mean federal govt) involved all. right sets nasty precedent. Governors hardly right half shit they've doing. 

This level stupid get society develops ""compassion"". starting making sure weak survive. big problem doubt, buts one federal govt solve solve.  Yeah sustain lib tears

Strangely conservative tears taste Which, end day big deal. still droplet/airborne. hospitals U.S. private. share patients out-of-network.

You probably want see bill out-of-network stay.

When private hospitals fill, dump patients public hospitals. still find hilarious keep trying discredit him. That's like U.S. invaded foreign nation president openly questioning career generals overseen multiple wars. Yay, America, we’re #1 Went round table discussion local school last month. discussing whether kids wear masks classroom Fall - spurred local anti-mask group Facebook that's rallied quite followers. One man meeting stated child's God-given right able infect children. course others stating taking away rights. want want told do. ""They're trying control us!!"", ""I make health choices child, school!"".

This school veteran teacher retire entire family high-risk people want wear masks around here. make choice protecting family's health, continue loves. lost 20+ years educational experience great teacher idiots around here.

On top that, local business town grand re-opening. drove happening huge crowd people outside, practicing social distancing, wearing masks - posing take pictures hanging out. They're closed two weeks due several positive COVID diagnoses. Basically ya. reproduction rate less one. get it, odds wont pass on. 

It creeping people get back normal though. track trace app means hopefully anymore new lockdowns localised. people told wear masks beginning need first line workers mask stockpile many sick people. think reason.

The first line stockpile make sense sick people = masks needed. Berlin thing, turned convention center overflow center room 1000 patients, thankfully used 39 patients hospital corona right now. Today:

Texas: 157

Denmark: 106

Finland: 59

Norway: 47 GOP worse, must know parties lie deceive us. Yes, things back almost normal, nightclubs open, restaurants open, people returning offices remote work, people traveling holidays abroad... 

Currently Sweden stricter guidelines Finland, example amount people per event 50 Sweden 500 Finland (and sports means 500 per stand stadium could thousands spectators per game).

Testing, tracing isolating seems working moment, testing anywhere near capacity. Anyway, one knows autumn turn out. one wears masks. People coming country tested. School starts weeks. rule Covid patients staff given procedure masks use respirators disease ruled out. Lots nurses became super spreaders Covid thanks hospitals lack preparation. Good you! found much easier quit vape. zero nic times, really care much. good thing vaping really care smell cigarette smoke. quit smoking smell like fucking siren call felt really hard resist. Country formerly known developed. Asymptomatic part issue. Airborn part well studied later. It’s knee-jerk reactions make someone respectable public safety position. Exactly. frightening degree magical thinking affected populace also health officials know better. Better add deaths little black book. parents lucky Big Gretch care call follow data best keep alive. 

I hope learn hard way look leadership competent future. interesting compare difference Melbourne, maskless idiots surge started (is everyone wearing masks now? news says order), Arizona/Texas/Florida ignored surge. Don’t forget recent salmonella outbreak  1,325 Alabamians died COVID-19. Deaths dramatically month June, 296 Alabamians perished. Thus far 399 Alabamians died COVID-19. surpasses state’s previous worst month May 358 Alabamians died global pandemic. 259 Alabamians died April 11 died March, first month novel strain coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, appeared July also worst month new coronavirus infections Alabama. Another 1,338 Alabamians diagnosed coronavirus Wednesday alone. Thus far 70,413 Alabamians diagnosed coronavirus. 32,877 cases July alone.

That highly infectious diseases work. Case, case, cluster, cluster, kaboom.

By time get kaboom, lockdown order contain US. way Fox News Sheep 1 every 10 people country... know would be, right? People fucking idiots. think? point view biggest difference culture. difference culture europe US. europe, one treats politicians like gods, also people europe (normal citizens also politicians) dont confidence US, therefore rely others opinions, therefore european leader really believes smartest person country, thats rely professionals. US fails levels, presidents, trough gouvernors, citizens, everyone sincerely thinks smartest person earth opinions best opinions possible. literally treat athlete scientist opinions equal.

European leaders knew need help professionals citizens, thats done. brought relevant professionals room give power support, communicate plan public honesty. slovakia, beginning crisis elections government changed dramatically, outgoing government corrupted crooks etc... done good job communication. Government said: ""Look people, things serious, dont enough masks even professionals, ask buy professional masks, instead wear scarf make cotton masks"", next day statement people media wore masks - news presenters, politicians, athletes etc... THEM. course public like ""why dont enough masks, bullshit! etc..."" understood situation started saw masks one week handmade masks almost anywhere sale. hand... lest say government straight forward people. Maybe good reason this, maybe know cultural difference said thing, americans would react differently, sort used crisis ""eastern europe"" one crisis, big deal us. Thanks protestors memorial day partiers.  tired winning. What’s better those, lay person? testing moment time anyway, could get virus 12 days waiting result. Additionally, high percentage false positives false negatives? u/estonianman u/Guncriminal  Stat safe there. That's good news.  Good god sub ridiculous. Listen Standard American response. ""It's that's problem, them"" still believe exists.

I understand point, believe probably right word. *know* exists critically evaluate evidence. Belief cannot differentiate subjective biases objective data. Yeah kind thought question unfair depending important day week somebody thought reflective rest test question asked month year is. reasonable. goal Democrats seize power.

That already going happen Even testing results take time. get tested today results don’t come back several days later. reporting lag, would need proactive order contain spread. Nurses often getting paid huge bonuses, doctors know volunteered. GrAaaace!!!! Right lol.

I love workers lose jobs ""acceptable"" unemployment fraction old wages.

But restaurant owners lose jobs ""they need complete bailout unacceptable!"" Also icu bed percentage include much Healthcare workers need per bed. want specialized nurse, maybe call icu nurses sure. believe supposed 1 nurse per 2 beds. think Mississippi read understaffed many places couple reasons. One nurses getting sick two Mississippi pays least state nurses lot nurses decided possibly getting sick they'd take contract somewhere they'd get paid more.

I think 8 11 beds per icu nurse means things going go worse. Wonder get public health officials sign letter prevents school districts sending kids building thousands others pandemic. live county exponential growth. Health dept. us red zone stay home orders suggested. school system wants us go back school. Teachers freaking school starts 3 weeks! Many Americans lured conspiracy theories longer trust government. climate distrust exacerbated spread misinformation allows movements like anti-vax anti-masks proliferate, aided platforms like facebook. many ways, failure American education system blame. Anti-vaxxers espouse dangers vaccines, claiming microchips government track people- whilst ignoring fact device use spread misinformation knows everything records location. I'd also wager part denial country could fail badly; furthermore, blatant lies spread Trump subordinates, still claim 'proven right eventually'. don’t get goal thinking conspiracy after. Businesses failing, unemployment time high. economy barely struggling along. 

It's plot disgrace Orange Savior. say Corona disappear election over. Every country world decided ruin economy hate Trump much. People work say they’re dying means calling COVID way push liberal agenda 😒 Tyranny minority causes lots deaths. 

*shaking heads*

liberals states remain open, hospital employee, share PPE countries dealing pandemic, also everyone else.

I fight people work safely entertainment sports.

I fight PPE restaurant workers hair stylists.

I fight PPE teachers students. No.  It’s function testing availability. last months news. America country nearly flatten curve give say fuck it, hard wear mask  paranoid uneducated society...lol!!!  Yeah, they've chosen stupid. said ""most scientists"" ""many scientists"" gave less 10, none concrete, direct evidence. fact, nobel guy proven wrong [this said absolutely certain evil Chinese created it. arguments different silly ""intelligent design"" argument insecure Christians make can't resolve beliefs scientific evidence. think plan Vaccine this.

If you’re dying Covid, prob take it.

If don’t symptoms test positive/asymptomatic Covid, wait out.

I think Vaccine good safety net instead nothing all.  rush Limbaugh listening parents went it’s like flu March it’s conspiracy prevent Trump re-elected abortions couple weeks ago deaths aren’t bad, last weekend media didn’t inform everyone virus everyone would working still it’s media’s fault . entire time I’ve told wrong get told don’t get getting news it’s fake news every step way I’ve told ahead time happen it’s happened. It’s mindnumbingly frustrating trying get heads. also live Michigan I’ve getting impeach whitmer emails said would that, she’s saved tens thousands lives already (this lockdown). Also said trump failed Covid miserably mom says he’s supreme ruler can’t mandate people wear masks , said fucking masks , there’s reason wear them, can’t even advocate them??? week apparently least. Also said tell hospitals send info White House CDC unconstitutionally detain people Oregon? Yeah he’s dictator sometimes don’t need it. Worst president time I’m concerned lack response end America know it. parents send shit family chat convince us need vote he’s done much pro life causes. I’m like pro life, he’s letting virus run course without anything, seems pro death me. Sorry rant disappointed parents. get uneducated people. also don’t want money schools country dumb virus begin with. told willing die economy. go home die peace, knowing saved economy. number going start taking seriously? country, Germany wit lockdown too. Still people complaining lockdown would better without one...  Want highlight seeing huge growth hospitalizations every day, see number coming leaving,” Chang attributes mask mandate went effect Texas July 3.***

If idiot governors opened us requiring masks think lives could saved. dead people, lives people left permanent effects. parents think. Either Covid-19 hoax created China, either way whole world scheme oust Trump install Nothing Democrats power. 
Peak American egotism, fucking nuts. never question said time. head buried Fox News never got full story. That’s logical. Protests protected constitution. Outdoor events private enterprises making money. constitutional protections. Since whether cops enforce law depend whether agree it. Wear mask gloves see father stay briefly , maybe ? Wow. people know word “refrigerated” means, right? recovering deliberately got re-exposed.

No issues.

Thanks Obama... oh wait... trump. Well....there misreporting and/double reporting. real time, isnt 100% accurate. takes months go double check accuracy go billing. numbers reported likely LOWER reality.

There isnt anything malicious it. someone multiple things wrong them, takes minute correctly define primaey cause death. 

For example, death pneumonia way certain states. likely inaccurate. stroke. didnt know devastating blood clots early on. worst thing dimwits refuse wear mask psychos use gun solve argument.

Reddit believes concept history grew privileged suburbs concept struggling actual third world shitholes dictators operate. natural selection, though, it? one idiots believe it, infect someone else does, die. federal law, none goons there.  Paraphrasing something read elsewhere:


Let's assume order reopen fully pre-pandemic levels need reach immunity, lowest estimate I've seen 65% population.


Next, let's assume Oxford vaccine successfully vetted end September. leaves 92 days January 1. picked date many businesses US set next decision making milestone date. Astra Zeneca (the company Oxford paired with) committed manufacturing 1 million doses per day. sake example let's say startup issues, scrapped doses, efficiencies gained, 100% effectiveness rate; leaves us 92 million vaccinated individuals end year. Also sake example let's say every dose delivered American, three months 28% population inoculated COVID 19. production rate take 8-9 months manufacturing bring US herd immunity, next summer.


Now course none assumptions made actually true, extrapolate entire world, take decades actually reach herd immunity. important that:


1. Everybody continues take preventative measures mask wearing sanitary precautions drive transmission rates much possible (and thus number vaccines needed herd immunity.

2. Pharmaceutical companies continue research vaccines first successful one released. vaccine higher success rate rapid manufacturability allow us reach herd immunity faster.


3. Pharmaceutical companies continue research treatments COVID 19 we're stuck probably least next years lockdown brought CO emmisions air 8%. absolute shit humans, great environment. Force people work deadly pandemic. True evil, people. hate people give response like did. ANYONE say ""OK""? many people tried pull card pisses point.

No, okay. also nearly terrible sounds, could be. deaths already incredibly old death's door (which already nursing homes), SIGNIFICANTLY better 20 year olds routinely dropping dead disease.

And get self righteous me, like know thinking right now, I'm saying ""okay"", tragedy families involved, ignore virus anything. significantly better outcome oldest weakest population majority deaths vs outcome mostly young, healthy people dropping dead. 1 low number Democrats win winner elections. win keeping whole thing going. Republicans.

Your idea winning idea winning completely different. Why? Meanwhile, I'm town hall CEO advocating - literally write - mask adherence social distancing. 

Funny happens leadership crazy. take sounds like particularly impressive mental gymnastics blame system rather obviously people irresponsible reckless personal finances. point personal responsibility need come in. Nj we've shut since February, son seen friend 5 times since three. Trump really removed deterrence people stupid things. imagine people lost love ones homeless. Deaths kind shit metric. wish could use DALYs, they're hard estimate probably impossible laypeople understand day week is, standard question many cases, like paramedics emergency doctors want check well person oriented blackout something. guess everybody test experienced distinguish uncertainty person care, problem.

Also animal questions would switch Camel Dromedary ;) 
I'm sorry loss, stay strong. red death cult strong Utah. I'm sorry. Basically, UK managed lock-down quick enough. drove indiana last week, none toll workers wearing masks. get government employees compliance Italy.

And Canada.

It seemed sensible time deny people care.

It history. medical profession since learned better. True, boomer generation Europe left-wing, anti-war civil rights oriented. known 68-generation Sweden big influence politics. civillians armed teeth shooting people dead. Yep, another example America fucked long Covid-19 came along.

Critical thinking would help groups. You’re traveling you’re moving. It’s huge difference. Europe clue is, assume he/she Republican?! long really patient room room negative pressure? Choir rehearsal known problem causing super spreading events, assume deep breathing exhalation. course get Covid patient patient room hour running treadmill. 

I know people seem gyms restaurants maybe 20 restaurants every gym maybe worry economic impact, plus take patio dining outdoors. Also skeptical gyms require masks exercising. Many require one lobby exercise area pretty funny. depends gym state. “And you’d like keep way, need something.” Why? 

You said don’t spread virus. 

So take place? reasoning events don’t spread virus shouldn’t take place? ain't till vaccine made virus mutates even work.  get medicaid? quit job making money able get think. Obviously check anything. it. I'm New England good job, moved South exes family, got stuck, never got good job again.

By golden girdle goddess...you guys really pushed bar way ""how high push stupidity?""  Apparently need oxygen order hurdle bar... remember 5 years old wanting go doctor doubt FA’s asked escalate beyond noting ban. assuming ban true, passenger won’t flying Delta anymore. given specialized airports huge pain. Imagine flying ATL allowed Delta flights. Oof.

Even worse applies airline agreements other. That’s whole bunch complexity people want add lives need travel work. Might wanna check people Italy China generally vacation Mass? I’m wondering arrived first place someone’s forgot pick prescription They’re protesting!  Radio host here! spoke mayor Indiana city said way they’ll enforcing essentially giving power business owners. Though police won’t hunt people wearing masks, someone comes Indiana business isn’t wearing mask refuses leave put one on, give business owners ability call police anti-masker arrested trespassing. hope here, target people aggressively mask wearing, necessarily people accidentally forgot mask car. I’m arguing events large crowds, especially it’s recreational take place. Yeah judge day. Cant remember day specifically though. also took couple days long stand alone interview Mary Trump show hasnt consistent last couple weeks. eradicate takes 100% participation. Let's beat logic critical thinking:

1) know virus survive surfaces 9 days longest. I've heard seen studies since January multiple countries.

2) know people infected contagious 14 days get infected, whether symptomatic asymptomatic.

3) know wearing mask helps prevent spread virus aerosols catching droplets significantly reducing viral load aerosols pushed air coughing/sneezing/talking/singing infected individuals. 

So.... let's make simple. Lockdown country 2 weeks. means real lockdown. places open hospitals. police, fire, medical, utility companies still open business needed hold infrastructure. Fast food restaurants, salons, grocery stores, hardware stores, closed. Nobody leaves house unless go work (for police/fire/medical/util businesses), way hospital, must wear mask leaving house. That's it.

The 2 weeks isolation result killing active virus particles surfaces. 2 weeks isolation prevent person person spread. anyone within 14 days symptomatic, go hospital feel ill everyone household gets tested. 14 days go lockdown feeling fine there's confidence believe can't infectious anymore. done (and done time around country), people active virus particles would hospital discharged test negative.

Increased nationalism, disinformation social inequality wake corona crisis political economic phenomena also psychological ones. writes Catarina Kinnvall, professor political science Lund University. 

The previously unknown, invisible unpredictable microbe coronavirus constitutes perhaps anything else shown vulnerable people, societies political systems are.

The new virus highlighted growing nationalism far-reaching disinformation campaigns, including Russia.

**The crisis followed** **footsteps** pandemic also shown social economic inequality, disproportionately affected economically weak groups hit women minorities particularly hard.

It also obvious social distancing something everyone indulge in. applies access water, alcohol, childcare medical care. Increased nationalism, disinformation social inequality wake corona crisis political economic phenomena also psychological ones.

In psychological research, one often distinguishes fear anxiety.

Fear applies specific thing relate to. Anxiety uncertainty much difficult define deal with. case also makes insecurity valuable weapon power seek curb, sometimes exploit, creating polarization finding scapegoats. Closing borders demonizing groups countries becomes way emphasizing one's group nation.

**The nationalism** followed footsteps corona new. Nationalism, course, existed long outbreak virus reflects range psychological dimensions around identity, stereotypes xenophobia, often elements antifeminism hypermasculinity. Brazil, India, Russia United States perhaps obvious examples, right-wing populism global face.

**As ideology** , form nationalism grown strong corona pandemic appealed growing crowd of, all, young men, also groups experience various forms economic psychological insecurity.

Closed borders, national travel bans, purchase protective equipment IVA places intended citizens likely reinforce form nationalism existing conflicts.

Especially advocates portray country force mobilize distribute resources psychological guarantees combat many perceive global threat.

Social media important platform channeling uncertainty defining threats. Here, apocalyptic stories systemic collapse wake pandemic justify panic measures far-reaching restrictions individual collective freedom.

Disinformation campaigns conspiracy theories also become tools for, among others, Russia right-wing populist movements United States, exploit growing concern insecurity around world order create chaos instability.

**There no** doubt pandemic increased insecurity frustration many people felt before.

The Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum United States President Donald Trump's populist rule, origins long history racist structures police violence.

It clear corona crisis affected social groups others many already fighting discrimination, poverty, rising unemployment economic insecurity neither economic psychological capacity fight virus' consequences.

**While richer** societies able spend enormous resources counteract negative effects, poorer countries opportunity. Large informal economies low confidence institutions state also made difficult almost impossible stay home even so-called lockdowns, shutdowns society.

In total, covid-19 meant least three different levels change:

• immediate health risk likely persist next two years.

• economic crisis international economists predict continue least five years come.

• polarization uncertainty, psychological dimension, difficult see end of.

The UN's children's fund Unicef ​​warns tendency decision-makers focus one-sidedly short-term solutions way financial crisis, points much greater resources must placed psychological dimension - create trust confidence among citizens. focus must common international strategies global issues, climate crisis, forgotten.

For record, states require vaccines.  pretend putting loop hole wont it. (Disgusting true Unfortunately) Remember reaching 1k deaths alarming? hope dont end going 100k daily deaths  That’s problem virus - doesn’t kill selectively. asshats would die, world would better place Hi Canadian here. wondering legal doctors euthanize? seems like better option end someone's suffering. Hey remember Trump said warm weather would kill COVID? 

Yeah, good times. unless main gun jams, can't use main firearm draw second, one person help you. multiple areas keep covered. Worst, least point government people realize severity situation. situation know going get infected wearing mask ""sports"" mentality, knowingly disobeying mask. get lot worst texas deaths related COVID due capacity overload. think timeline they’ve already started manufacturing everything risk Well insurance such. ACA requires law eat cost. Otherwise bill would $1m. another dude spent amount time got hit $1.1m bill. insurance ACA fit bill. it.

Now, might answer bigger, densely populated states, heard idea kinda thought pretty good one. Tail lights, 5 mph limit, jaywalking, etc. That’s realm. Enforcing public safety, much. one believes getting tested puts hospital.  Better conserve able test symptomatic all. tore May Australia recorded 38 flu deaths year, none since April. compares 430 deaths average time year. 

So whole covid thing actually net lifesaver (even royal pain arse): 133 deaths covid, 392 fewer deaths flu. *during pandemic

Working job business transaction, tool demanding right now!  “The cases higher people keep getting tested more” Second this. personally know quite sensible good people. contrary would consider *all* current fellow citizens (Europe) positive examples human species neither. 

It's shame though, US helmed less ideal representative right now. one thing personally still understand little opposition within conservative party. Surely sizeable junk people happy current leadership neither. kind would believe second conservative canditate would *real* chance, he/she? how's Georgia now? given choice.

Here Atlanta. cousin got covid working restaurant weeks either void unemployment (can’t get quit) offered job back.

Chest pains, fever, loss tase smell, cough, etc.

He finally gets doc appt 4 days getting symptoms. Doc schedules fast results test. goes get tested, results come back negative. Kinda weird, right.

A hours later gets call doctor says “You corona virus, ignore test. I’d tell get tested get regular test takes ~8 days results, point there. symptoms go beyond Pneumonia, you’re healthy young contracted randomly.”

Then, asking happening, doctor responds: “I don’t know, you’re 6th person today I’ve call tell ignore negative test result.”

It’s fucking insane. We’re shitty getting results, results aren’t even reliable point we’re getting false negatives massive rate docs overrule tests since re-testing takes long matter quick tests issued unreliable. I'm Florida friend mine's church annual summer church camp kids last week despite rising cases. 200 people went, half ended getting sick COVID symptoms get tested.

Meanwhile, people Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Czech practicing stringent mask wearing protocols. result couldn’t proof Fauci wrong. ever protective neck mask pics, think. Let guess, god loved much send us covid father goes back maker That’s point

it shows disregard Americans already bodies. Heart disease kills lot people Covid one cares. 

Again I’m pro mask pointing hypocrisy.  mom fat greater chance underlying condition thus making susceptible Covid diseases. hasnt gotten attention all, see people eating shit food always have, sitting couch always have.

It's almost people willingly bad shit bodies. See: drugs, alcohol, smoking

Obese people understand unhealthy. Awareness problem. many (where issue specifically genetics), problem self-control.

We could run 24/7 news cycle eating healthy fat unhealthy, probably make difference. good news is, choose eat unhealthy, contagious. obese person walks talk, I'm going become obese standing near them.

Do understand different issue COVID? doubt, obesity serious issue COVID, different issue. free attempt bury reality gaslight people deluge fake tweets want, yet still call bullshit things know untrue.

Hospitals constant inspections outside accrediting institutions go data. find discrepancies aspect care, fail inspections get sanctioned lose accreditation. data manipulated, people go prison. entire industry built around fact. Please educate twitter links. challenge semantics here.

I agree overall concept expressed.

.. let's think word responsibility.

The responsible thing do, every individual person, limit spread virus. stay home avoid nightclubs.

I think, perhaps Republican way responsibility all, self-sufficiency.

.. think we're seeing America right people trying self-sufficient, MINUS responsible part. ""Strategy"" know what, I’m sure that. 

It kind feels like since told people use masks beginning (to save healthcare workers) people still refuse it. hand haven’t heard much push government wear mask all. 

I also don’t think conservative provinces would ever make mask mandate. bit problem states politics much decide much science we’re willing/able understand. 

So far it’s left individual businesses make call slowly requiring masks. I'm grateful they're implementing better policies now.

Masks mandated public places starting August 1, $250 fine non compliance.

2 weeks quarantine travelers sites monitored security council.

What? Amish practically scholars! educate kids one room schoolhouse grade 8, learn trade work farm. I'm sure strong grasp science behind COVID19. Shut fuck up. Stop spreading fake conspiracy theories, fucking brainlet. high school college kids said fuck virus went Spring Break vacations anyways? ones COVID parties? Try keep mask child 2. don’t even know people could keep one child 2-4. security people... Ted Cruz wear mask world know Ted Cruz looks like wearing mask can't that.  Yes, meaning mind, literally, figuratively. bend policy cater criminals? Remember: criminals people commit crimes. 
""Wear mask."" 
""No."" [Pulls gun] &lt;--- criminal. 
""Oh! I'm sorry! unaware criminal. Please step right inside wish! Welcome Walmart!""

But, skipping steps, right? Unfortunately, new theory is: ""these people killed causes (accidents, heart attack, cancer, etc.) happened infected virus.""

I given arguing them; always come something. someone close catch virus, never accept virus thing. Hmm heard safe children. brought wish people gave much attention obesity covid. Obesity causes deaths covid. Thats fact. Im discounting covid, stating fact. obesity direct tie covid. makes worse. United states needs healthier. Wow im bad guy. Fuckin mob mentality ridiculous. Yes. grandma died yesterday. COVID, far know tested admitted negative. far saying pneumonia high BP irregular heartbeat. sent ER Tuesday morning died Wednesday ended life support measures. 93 good health one write offs (I guess) even COVID. 

Here’s thing though- pandemic hadn’t botched badly maybe wouldn’t die alone. Maybe wouldn’t wait 7 hours ICU (and yes know it’s normal wait never sure long would wait normal July day year), maybe wouldn’t spent last four months senior home alone. mom scheduled able visit outside Saturday. people write would say blame restrictions able visit her, don’t, blame people didn’t everything could slow spread, protested minimal inconvenience even whine masks. could almost COVID free June July instead get this. 

And work extremely unimportant restaurant job got news, listening regulars say they’d eat two days since state reopened restaurants. Yeah figured it’s really hard guess. Republicans tend care money people although call Christians. know anyone Tesla. they're real. Bush II spent next seven months sitting classroom blaming goat ""My Pet Goat"" 9/11 ... 

40% country would decided goats terrorists I've told would disappear. mean president eventually right. Eventually... *Eventually*... wonder fact billions federal money meant testing spent yet anything  saying they've started testing widely: EDIT: Sorry, link March lol. sure increase happening now! recent article: ofc test widely cases well see so... guess population found, MIGHT mean there's concerning outbreak going on.

[This puts Florida ICU beds remaining front center.  ""If testing, would cases"" - Donald Trump that's rub. Everyone lost jobs due pandemic actions - personal responsibility. That's thing republicans always want ignore, world perfect, factors play EVERY moment person's actions.

most people get office school.

the large drugstore chains also vaccination days.. maybe vaccines offered many doctor’s offices, clinics, health departments, pharmacies college health centers, well many employers, even schools.  don’t regular doctor nurse, get flu vaccine somewhere else, like health department, pharmacy, urgent care clinic, often school, college health center, workplace. Systemic distrust rebellion government (or authorities/experts general, couldn’t tell many people sides I’ve met don’t trust doctors accountants lawyers whatever professionals recommend, person opposite), factionalism/tribalism that’s bordering open warfare (watch closely next 6 months), society large surge capacity ANYTHING (hence shortage toilet paper demand rose shortage vegetables/meats food production factories shut outbreaks facilities). disturbing incarcerated women single parents. “reopened economy” whatever means  don’t get decide  care long happen anyone know Exactly.

Those genetic traits passed on.
When look US currently, wonder, science wrong maybe, one looks likely, Homo Sapiens evolved proportionally. study N95 masks, recommended general use. one cloth masks? Anyone thinks rest world never accept American immigrants insane both. Hey good news change don’t know forward U.S. terms actual resources available, honestly people know anything except online banking (speaking personal standpoint, business wise know area still lot reliance physical trust cheques, bank drafts, etc sometimes necessitate visit/bank runner still).

I 40 family, friends acquaintances ranging 20s 70s. people know actually carry cash - forced go drive ATM every months replenish stake office lottery pool otherwise never cash me. still get cheques (for reimbursement expenses etc) sometimes deposit electronically. bank last five+ years mortgage documents get bank draft, things done via email, electronically even sign new documents. rarely even bring wallet except ID everything done via phone/watch, apps, Apple Pay, electronic transfers, etc.

It’s really easy avoid going banks want to, unless maybe much smaller town people know rural areas cities deal mostly online/digital banking. Extend UI, lock weeks, everyone wear masks after... economy rebounds fall. Wow, still stubbornly high.. Thursday. Wake loud crack thunder. Rain. bad news read. Vaccines works but, bad news seems overshadow it. Meds, therapy, none all, brain knows whats going on. ugly depressing. 

stay indoors. wear mask go out. hope town doesnt turn Texas, turning patients away sending home literally die......This shit mind rest day. Flu hurricanes add whole level this... Really? means New York strict lockdown, good compliance levels borne mobility data, yet 6500 deaths nursing homes state. Seems like wasn’t us.

 buddy went Court speeding ticket yesterday denied phone appearance due covid symptoms tested yet. 

 Anyways shows masked noticed half people walking around building wearing masks. There's sign entering building says masks required meanwhile police walking around maskless well.

 point. goes court judge maskless. Until...
She heard cough asked covid symptoms. said yes flipped yelled immediately leave court. said looked terrified frantically put mask.

 informed contacted Clerk's last week told symptoms requested telephone appearance. called liar.

 Jokes though. also email County attorney last week see reconsideration could made public health safety interests. Like Phil Collins song reply all. attorney care either there's proof buddy infact contact courts otherwise would write email complaining courts refusal address covid symptoms issue.

 Can't even trust local government responsible around here. complete BS.

 wish could seen look judges face freaked out. Sorry serves right telling someone covid symptoms would get warrant arrest coming appear unless hospitalized. national policy problem politicians wanting science get way recovery, reality obviously gets way. Ignoring crisis national strategy. Sweden lockdown. Netherlands barely locked down. Germany also light lockdown. Think public health systems institutions; think allowing mass gatherings (e.g. protests/riots). Good news Covid-19 deniers. Many claim social distancing wearing masks weakens everyone's immunity. go swimming sewers strengthen immune systems gain herd immunity.

I'm speech path. kids wearing masks. ideal, going everything enforce it. feels important media public question willing produce numbers second year stats grad would question within five minutes review. course, every measure precaution prevents reduces risk disease good. Minimising number deaths main target comes disease, somebody making ""except lot people going die"" point nothing fearmongering. People die matter what, yet still go lives. Two things:

1) Anecdotally, type people BLM protests attended wore masks (I’d venture say least 90%)
- don’t trust drunk, party-going race attenders wear masks socially distance. 

2) It’s necessarily outside event I’m worried about. 
- BLM protests weren’t proceeded followed 87,500 people frequenting bars/restaurants area. can't. That's heartbreaking get handle this. pity *from* political leaders...

ftfy brother goes PNW heard going online November cold/flu season ramps up. guess it’s least something, seems decision made months ago hasn’t changed address current data. 

I teach NWI school far, we’re going back. parents going various district school board meetings advocating eLearning start year off. Hopefully something gives. What's nuts go store, see enforcing it, come back. I've since beginning pandemic. want placate adult infants completely miss people, like me, refuse shop places. I'm full supporter vaccines, I'm kind scared use one rushed ones, honestly. makes nervous longer term data. event last week already know least 100 people got sick? Where's news story this? I’m sure know many diabetic people. Flying stress flying pandemic could certainly spike tank someone’s blood sugar rapidly. Mine absolute roller coaster I’m writing exam laws come visit. stress diabetic pandemic likely die get it... fly I’d flipping out. 

A simple juice box suffice bring sugars up, least initially. One (ex) friends category retired cop. He’s nicest person world - someone dares restrict way. becomes raving lunatic. 

I first saw side beginning pandemic Feb, restaurants starting careful. gone eat despite encouraged avoid social activities. slow reason relation changes threw temper tantrum it. months followed, heard multiple stories wife go grocery store manage behavior. 

Retired cop. carries firearm knows use it. That’s scary hell context. apparently believes shouldn’t follow rules rest us still many connections within local law enforcement avoid responsibility whatever does. Cross immunity coronaviruses means number nowhere near 70%-80% Ah yes...sacrificing elderly....like Lt. Gov Patrick wanted.  That’s like, 50 Benghazi’s! send kids schools there’s hospital beds left small nugget truth that. Hospitals get reimbursed insurance (including Medicare) based number things one things factors diagnostic codes. true covid reimburses high rate, taking care covid patients super expensive. However, notion doctors lying inflate covid deaths still ridiculous. September 1, 2021?

CDC US made similar mistake reporting S-CFR rate .4% adjust weeks later IFR .65% everybody questioned number provide data back up. somebody generally leans Democrat Republican, actually see logic behind inflating damage done virus. Republican Government failing respond accordingly Republican Government bring reamed insistence Economy Lives. lie say Republicans lying scum extreme measures taken would make easier shut remove hateful, bigoted, racist, sexist, classist monsters power all. way country grow improve situation install series Presidents non-corrupt congressman senators invested policies couple decades without flip flopping every 4-8 years like been.

If lying damage need see GOP disappear forever, worth whatever damage may caused process least modern Democratic values take better care people affected economic downturn Republicans would. Plus economy made thing. human concept wherever humanity deems be. Without shitty people helm, balance restored.

I virus real thing quite destructive, find weird entire world recovering couple months, yet we're basically one countries still accelerating lightspeed. Either stats BS things exaggerated political gain (which I'm okay with) things really bad actions/information intentionally withheld widen situation reason (which makes less okay Dem. party would better Repub. party case.) aren’t getting news. I’m intrigued unique “individualism meets left” viewpoint, something’s got give. People “dumb” go poor education systems influenced political grifters prey upon power. Saying everyone responsible *sounds* nice, global pandemic—where people’s stupidity might kill *you* loved ones—is great example rugged individualism doesn’t fucking work. collective whether like not, long poor leadership get bad results. federal mask mandate pandemic task force would saved peoples lives. Don’t make excuses bad leadership. everyone responsible leaders responsibility accountability, even government? tip you!

But truly, staying home Pharoah’s son would meant staying around large retinue staff concubines etc. I'm American, can't imagine Donald Trump considered obese. guy would among fattest people country.  Meanwhile, I'm discussions people also parents pissed school reopening. 

We. Are. Fucked. 

Three years now, maybe over. first, thinking 9 months. I'm thinking three years. that's Biden wins. saying much options November shit. teens won’t die. elderly relatives spread to.  really wonder people refuse wear one "" right "" start wearing one like whats tipping point? point go OH shit real better start wearing die. idea arrest outbreak runs course, live constant threat another outbreak occurring. means preventative measures like visiting nursing homes, strict border controls, etc become permanent. goal need protections allowing population gain immunity, thus making outbreak impossible. 

I'm making judgement whether ""good"" strategy ""right"" strategy, saying ongoing suggestion strategy patently false. know, right? Give every American household ten pack reusable MAGA masks... Propaganda opportunity lost. One thing surprises discussed method now.

I'm going argue areas high case rates be:

1. need go don't.
2. Good hand hygiene touch face. Wash phone too.
3. sick, get tested isolate waiting result.
4. go wear mask. wearing it, learn wear properly too. Except know sure since Covid-19 new virus. Also, kids schools right still deaths, want pack classrooms play odss? faculty, parents, anyone else would come contact school hours? depends state. reporting results day test result recorded/reported. 

Some states backdating sample obtained (you got swabbed) original symptom onset. Georgia one state done fine absolved totally mess. disingenuous though think done great job COVID-19. man collects yearly salary $375,000 federal government reason. 

Its clear hold many people (including POTUS) responsible mess sub decided mess doings one single individual (POTUS). disagree opinion respect it. Nothing else really say though. know know broward high? mean it’s next door Miami finding elephant Everyone supports schools reopening *where possible, extent possible*. controversial. seems like locking inflexible all-or-nothing view.

Infections United States rapidly accelerated since first case detected Jan. 21. took country 98 days reach 1 million cases. took another 43 days reach 2 million 27 days reach 3 million. taken 16 days reach 4 million rate 43 new cases minute. 100% agree, always get annoyed people talk people generally selfish without realizing many us forced communities survive. Paying businesses close 1-2 months (or least rent mortgage moratorium everyone minimum) would one straight-forward solutions mess, like said, look countries adopted approaches achieved (relative) success. much private public sector leadership clamoring daily infuriating. Everybody ridiculed best. Unlikely, symptoms appear largely result body fighting virus. It’s postulated symptomatic cases likely due tempered immune response rather protection cells poorly understood statistically unlikely provide kind immunity protects one infection. Right. good boss, smart boss, surrounds smart competent people. Trump took office, figured he'd like that. Maybe best leader, successful businessman, would use resources disposal get job done (right). guess ego got better him. Still 21% positive rate total tests reported today. Frustrating also entirely sure far date back. hard paint current picture what's going state massive backlogs lengthy turnaround times. 

Hospitalizations start upward trend small spikes yesterday, that's good. actually saw little dips across board regarding numbers (inpatients, ER visists, ICU beds) encouraging. last part straw man I’m really going address it. one arguing dictator, reasoning shouldn’t centralized government flimsy. 

You’re misunderstanding *how* underfunding education problem. uneducated poorly educated doesn’t mean you’re anti-masker, you’re anti-masker good chance poor, uneducated background. Poor education doesn’t necessarily create anti-maskers, good education prevent anti-maskers. Who? Where? When?  someone South Florida, actually say people right thing. much stupid people, great places get together stupid like parks beaches. 

Our governor doesnt want limit ability stupid people gather makes us look really bad. 

So anti maskers place like let's say...Iowa, dont really many places converge here.

The spike disturbing amazing combination group idiots empowered another group idiots run state. No, 60% people vaccine result 50% people immunity, we'll greatly slow disease down. wont sort situation 50% immunity means cut cases/deaths half might like 50% immunity cuts cases deaths 80-90% subsequent ""covid seasons."" almost certainly disease circulates human population foreseeable future like flu is, ""get covid shot"" become even bigger deal ""get flu shot."" simple answer applying citizenship. able pass that. 

Or see asylum gets yeh don’t go first leave.   Hmm. Odd.  Smart! idea parents, young folks, risky behavior and, transplant friend's case, signing death certificate insane! also think transplant hoax?

Upon reflection, situation need powerful unions protect citizens lethally exploitative corporations like Universal Studios (and Disney).

Is civil employer put employees customers grave risk demanding silence employees workplace? Would say alignment spirit founding fathers' intentions? BEES?!??! People sub act like anybody doesn’t wear mask stay home kind ignorant, selfish asshole. simply case. beginning virus walk America, would around mid-March, people went along restrictions. believed virus existential threat life knew going permanently altered. turns out, vast majority people go supermarkets, go gym, go mall, go beach, play recreational sports teams, nothing bad happen them. know this? People state three months, life pretty much back normal. It’s great. aren’t dying, virus huge disaster. wait! contradicts everyone else sub thingK: virus bigger deal actually is. Unless person elderly unhealthy, vast majority people going effected virus. 

Yes, aware younger people catch virus become quite sick, exceptionally rare, way beyond statisticians would even call “an outlier“.

This isn’t March April. need adapt times. Clearly, virus big deal originally told, especially 80% deaths occur nursing homes. don’t think it’s right expect people danger becoming seriously ill virus continue live shitty, unfulfilling lives simply protect elderly sick. elderly sick ones locked down, everybody else.

But 'despite increase, signs major outbreaks', points out.

- Danish Agency Patient Safety responsible active infection detection, also report 
Renewable chains infection control. number new admissions also still highly stable low level.

Therefore essential, infection kept down, Heunicke believes.

Our multipartysystem also less polarized. major parties (except AfD lesser degree Die Linke) tend keep mind might need point coalition since noone gets majority own, parties much cooperative politicise shit everything. Especially considering Germans love one thing politics: stability. perceived infighting petty shit tends hurt election booths. Let explain bit clearer.

What happen:

1. Patient treated something that's Covid.
2. Patient dies.
3. Hospital gets $X dollars government cover treatment.
4. Covid death count increase.

What actually happening:

1. Patient treated something that's Covid.
2. Patient dies.
3. Hospital claims person Covid, thus making treatment received ""Covid treatment"" regardless actually happened.
4. Hospital gets $X+Y dollars government cover ""Covid treatment"" took place.
5. Covid death count increases.

The extra money treatment, death, easier fudge numbers dead people living witness contest claim patient Covid. Seen happen... ""they're counting deaths covid.. hoax"" linked person average number deaths US foe tor time period claimed fix number show 700 would closer 200,000...

I found switching cigarettes vape easy. Didnt bother all. vape good either. sure years come they'll shown terribly unhealthy. Still I've found poxy hard cut vape.  Hey buddy !! Hope well you!! I've thinking bout whole conversation too. Im arguing article but...thats 1 tiny hospital officially 16 covid deaths potentially another 17 . numbers call article kinda sensationalism stirring pot little. says send patients paragraphs lower says well 1000 icu beds available state . whole thing confuses tbh .I noticing texas average age people catching covid way younger covid 1st hit .also deaths still multiplying like ny nj makes 0 sense !!! seems crazy somehow virus affecting younger people killing nearly many .I almost understand deaths chalk better medical care infections younger people make sense. 
On positive note looks like immunization shot oxford working hopefully months can't remember companies name 4500 ppl tested looks like 100 percent success.i know gone stage 4 trials signing 100 thousand volunteers finish research ..im really hoping none grow 3rd eyes crazy shit mass give shots get rid disaster..part wants see brave proud antivaxxer communitys comes covid. . Ok im rambling like unibomber ..hope great weekend please stay safe .. I'm American work banking industry...I've read Austrailia, banking majority-forced mostly digital, working banking pretty much breeze safe, people -even older ones- used things online need minimal interaction in-person banks. 


In America, older generation -for part- refuses form technology banking. check balances, use ATM outside, deposit checks. Despite 'at risk' population, zero change daily habits -which come bank every day, often two three times day. concern virus maybe 80% whatsoever.  


So wondering anyone knew banking system Canada technology forward allow happen (or maybe people little aware actually happening...). Thanks! I’ve got 3.5 year old. amount anything force keep on. manually kept hands guarantee he’d wrestle off.

Thankfully situation control single parents need things like grocery shop? It’s like immunizations everyone wear mask protect can’t (like small children likely mentally disabled people). understool deadly virulent virus was. still people believe threat.

Denying people care seemed worse option, time.

Congratulations smarter hindsight.  ones told wear mask before? Yeah parents would probably try sue university something case. Must nice universal healthcare! sucks living knowledge majority injury illness probably bankrupt life even insurance. Subtract 3 total then. mean know way way way bigger issues right this, can't help feel kinda bad athletes trained whole lives get point reach Olympics disappear them. Like said, far serious issues right now, another kinda sad thing this. much death suffering Trumps hands. public discussions New York New Jersey, too. still cases COVID 19 US anyway ? fearless leader say would go away hot weather ? still cold US ? cutoff certain age one time resources check chances are.

American, doubts process going fair. place people think hoax? Even non profits run profit. Trump economy like businesses presidency - dumpster fire failure. 99% people Melbourne wearing masks Barely anyone uses masks Nordic countries. authorities made stigma. Denmark recommended public transportation.

It's strange see (Sweden's) neighbours follow world expert consensus great results Spring. Sweden authorities saying recommend masks crowding, press conference may adress crowding communities reporting. also still claim there's little scientific evidence masks beneficial, usual presenting none own. Cool take southwest rest trash They're genuine, 99% comments concern trolls. mean, agree, it’s ok leave “why didn’t god save you?” That’s simple-mindedness side. It’s terrible people like Nuns civil servants devoted lives serving community, dying like crazy disease. I’d say along lines “Not even God save shit. Wear damned mask!” heard flight causing cluster yet

I think something way cabin ventilation set up. recirculating air. Instead, fresh air constantly pumped cabin engines. Yakima kicked ass - soon mask mandate went effect, mask usage went 60% 95%. worriedly watching Seattle really wrestled thing ground. Tons love Yakima! naive comment. think invests, people already millionaires? least people gathering inside What's point? There's also lot people care trying things obesity. really think first person try raise awareness obesity?

This may hard hear, but... COVID-19 obesity bad potentially deadly. Obesity gotten attention many years...COVID new, dominating news. Everyone already knows obesity bad. people seem denial COVID bad. Good luck keeping college kids partying. wish anyone tries well. shouldn’t partying course anyone remember age thinking untouchable? Yeah, good luck.

Is different county/state, mishmashing test results smearing across variable length time?

Or US hiding/fucking data HHS CDC handling numbers?  Sort of. leaving decision school district. KC school districts KS side pushing back opening. 

Still sucks state education board abdicating responsibility.  article saying US Gov purchased doses would amount 40$ per person. think department HHS said given americans free There's lot elective surgeries. Chronic conditions require regular care generate lot money. 

The issue Emergency Departments almost always operate loss. cannot refuse render care patient can't pay. Uninsured patients often forced default hospital bills. 

With Covid-19, majority patients coming Emergency Department.

As many many people informed many many times Infection sweden peaked late march hospitalization mid April. 

Can pretty please confirm understood taken heart? I’m coronavirus denier means think statistics need included appropriate context best understood. zero understanding 1200 daily deaths deduped capacity people severe underlying conditions believe context extremely important.

For troubling thing coronavirus lack unified response amount misinformation. people bombarded sides different stats, anecdotes, opinions, falsehoods hard come consensus truth. wet dreams, anti fascists fighting nazis. No, worthless. 100%. Literally nothing pertains Trump article. obsessed shitstains come every thread whine Trump. sad state country days. mind 24/7 answered question then. Why? country handled pandemic well.  Separate issues. politicization mask-wearing country given ridiculous boost flailing. death rate overall gone people dying COVID instead things? Restart point reason shit moment, probably following months. live knowing killed grandparents. That's fucked Alternative fans guys knows... agree disagree. stupid stuff like removing plandemic YouTube feeds conspiracy nuts fantasies, putting gas delusional fires causing Streisand effect. effective approach counter lies truth, suppress lies. people click one YouTube video stop watching YouTube.  Young people don’t clubs...nor run gov’t allowing clubs stay open... those, additional 120 deaths. Well, bedside care little different someone sick. someone COVID, isolate take care long possible, need help. need help probably need go hospital anyway. Sweden lockdown. Netherlands barely locked down. Germany also light lockdown. 
 
But shut events large gatherings practiced proper social distancing. Americans can't even told government. Yeah, unfortunately it’s happening people need wake up. Corporations killing planet rich killing poor little left. Nah FB full of...""masks scientifically proving stop spread, still exhaling, that's getting out!""

I wish kidding but....ugh... people stupid. know stop spread, dramatically reduces spread. One people's husband member city council believes crap. I’m wondering hospices even take cases. Visits put staff risk limit number patients see. nurses won’t allowed nursing homes contact pass certain timeframe two negative tests. Even know facility wouldn’t allow in. 

I’ll talk friends hospice see policies this. said numerous times, ton people curious test, they’ll sign sit hours brain scraped worlds least gentle q-tip.

They aren’t sick, even exposed, looking something do.

I literally say every press conference.

I feel like guys aren’t listening me.

Wear mask, stay distant, everything fine, lots people getting tested funsies, thehospitalsarefucked, beaches open, eventually over.

It’s clear. Tegnell reminds face masks justify sick person get train.

What weird hangup idea recommending people wear masks means everyone go nuts start getting trains sick (or rather knowingly sick, since know people know COVID without symptoms undetected symptoms walking around)? entire ""strategy"" revolved around personal responsibility right thing following ""recommendations"". honestly believe masks social distancing mutually exclusive concepts? people sub really ignorant terrible people pointless statement. Someone asked Delta experience, recently horrible. say anything ruining life couldn’t handle it? No. exactly feel need defend Delta? experience wasn’t even close one difficult times life, trying give life wisdom always worse shit. I’m well aware that, thanks. 


Again: Delta sucks hard, I’ve flown hundreds times never worse experience two week period, would use stricter masks, $3.50 sandwich end 10 hour wait way something “grateful” for. Yes will.... Certain crazy people demanding let store allowed enter new phenomenon scale might need permanently placed officers We’re much science math ides “exponential growth” “death lagging indicator 
true infection rate” “aerosolized virus remains air 20 minutes” like foreign language lot us moron Americans. country idiots. grab MLB Show, set AIs max run it. goes say though seems July 22, 11,461 55,263 hospital beds available statewide, 1,088 ICU beds open.

I guess hospitals accepting patients keep beds open locals need them. brakes death cult train Years, lol. I'm actually little surprised b/c traveling last weekend Chick-Fil-A's restaurants employees masked. (Arby's disgrace.) went super impressed handling things get go. Masks face shields drive in, swipe card. Brought box several orders take mine without touching etc. depends define ""case."" Memesantis best probably still happening NY. Cases declining, gone. Mitch McConnell French Revolution....this arouses me. thinking like hasn’t state/feds helped setup staff field hospital. see coming. I’m sorta glad happened won’t re-elected. Even without Covid-19 he’s worst President US history. bad question, dont think even repubs widely calling restrictions. Yeah, sounds right.  OP, I'll give story stopped.

We went Gencon Indy one year. Flew Delta best price/time combo. Getting fine air travel generally is.

The day scheduled leave, see reports Delta's computer issues. We're scheduled depart till like 1 PM breakfast time, whatever, they'll probably fixed there'll small delay it.

Get airport bit early safe, fucking disaster area. GIGANTIC lines, one knows what's going on, computer systems down. get gate wait. wait. one knows anything, occasionally get update text flight bumped later later. Finally around 8-9 PM, leave.

Unfortunately, change flights Detroit. land Detroit told flight side airport 15 mins get close gate there. grab bags book it. lags behind since asthma (when finally caught up, minor asthma attack trying get fast enough). But, make it, get plane. We're ready go....but there's pilot. know he's way, idea is. let us plane. tell us we're boarded next 15 mins, flight crew hit limit long working row, we'll stuck Detroit next day. pilot shows get us back flight told us seconds remaining would cancel. 

What hour trip turned 12 hours. Local people knew drove got home got home flying.

So next day, want see happened. start looking things up, found big power outage affected data center. Alright, happens, backups? dumb fucks backup data center local power grid primary servers. backups down, too.

To apologize, gave us bunch miles. So, next year, took trip Chicago using miles got. realized booked, screwed something flight there. called changed, repeating need return trip left alone. Night we're supposed leave, go check flight gone. idiot cancelled flight home. one took multiple hours phone dealing progressively higher higher managers someone would damn thing it. got flight, course since last minute, I'm middle seat next SO.

So last time flew Delta unless there's major change things, last time fly Delta. Checkmate! wish people would take opportunity say ""hey, medical stuff made overseas that's bad idea"".  unnerving deficit shot huge amount large percentage people think answer UBI. could bring jobs back right now. Got it, selfish narcissist. Ok.

As someone getting PUA unemployment benefits, support financial relief package essential workers federal government. specific virus, research indicated virus dense face level. meant indicated masks needed wirh presumed low risk arent effective. We're crazy civil war. ones pissed side wanted win, lost. makes sense randomized sample testing people actually symptoms, results delayed. need know first someone symptoms sick, need know people contact got sick showing symptoms yet. Except pool teachers tend older 50 many different health issues regardless much care it. TLDR winter typically people hospitals summer, more/worse respiratory issues anyway American Italy here, also compare *entire* European Union’s data US (so much comparable terms size, population, different approaches, testing, etc), data tell everything need know messed situation US is. Maybe He's one vamps Twilight, ""sparkle"" sun. agree that, think, sad result lack knowledge virus

Other countries beginning open up, don’t think signals end yet. Thats say would opening nationwide lockdown, however think safe say done deathcount wouldn’t high. Crazy excuse everything Pritzker could difference maker. even political issue, Republican DeWine first close schools put restrictions place. Even Cuomo telling DeBlasio shut schools. DeWine set first set strict restrictions Pritzker swooped nowhere locked day Ohio. Pritzker made fun Trump taking action making states protect themselves. hurt Trump’s ego decided would dig heals continue nothing rather taking Pritzker’s advice.  tried run car came back friend getting shot. I’d say car attempted lethal force. [it’s like aren’t cases irate customers shooting employees trying get wear Why? affect oxygen exchange? Better educated people likely wear masks. I’m even sure comparison trying make, doesn’t seem relevant. Lmao 300k karma talking friends Parents cannot legally restrict 18+ year olds. get many people make wrong comparison. people required wear shoes entire lives. Smoking bans slow burn across nation many years psychologically prepared people. yes, violent pushback customers smoking bans back day. Wearing mask gone something illegal many places months ago requirement. That's abrupt change. people want ignore what's going forced confront going cause blockback.

Yes, definitely better teach critical thinking. Including putting shoes others actually understanding coming even wrong. title. first sentence. still image. Wait see shit motion. going 100x worse. know guy said, fat. 

But least trying deny it, hide behind language. guess send hospitals instruct rather tell people go home die. referral service coordination suggests there’s room state surrounding states well. Wow, would *definitely* prefer dying slow terrifying death away family versus ANTS me. actual fuck bringing people back thing gotten monumentally worse past months continuing so? assessment would rush lift lockdowns ""hail mary"" pass admin. Trump knows recession materializing Oct/Nov would game reelection. 100%. gamble getting people back work even though likely going cause virus surge lead snowballing problems dwarf original, potential recession. maybe something freaky could happen like virus goes away ""operation warp speed"" delivers vaccine population September. Low odds success maybe better sure 0% letting recession happen.

Having said that, maybe still chance timing. Maybe August September lockdowns rushed open around late October time Trump victory laps. knows. find pretty disturbing seems political game though opposed (a crisis management challenge). friend ER doctor, guy nasty motorcycle accident (no helmet, brain little ketchup point). Guy tested positive covid cause death written covid. 

So think saying legit. Yes, please fight people fighting basic survival loot social security :) 1) quite glad live US

2) People China free protest well. might get snatched streets kind unmarked governmental organization... Oh wait, happening US too! saying part it. sure is. intellectually dishonest seriously claiming mass protests nothing spread. 

People keep saying everyone wearing masks seen plenty videos showing plenty people wearing them. 

It really invalidates arguments people make refuse acknowledge simple facts obvious truths. disingenuous joking?

If Covid contagious, shutdowns lockdowns would needed, obviously. virulence necessitates controls, total body count.

If cancer suddenly became similarly contagious contact, would absolutely Priority One alert nations earth would indeed locked working panic solution. thing said South Korea too, found caught 8 percent cases hardest hit city. election?

Jesus Christ. Look around. Hospitals filled. look like need immediate medical attention tell ride home call gets 54 Chick-Fil-A locations Colorado according Chick-Fil-A website.  

Unfortunately McDonalds really provide easy way get list current locations. It’s military. It’s unidentified “federal agents” DHS Border Patrol.   never made everything political, there's helluva lot people blame start blaming everyday Americans Yeah thought remembered via MIS-C may begin weeks child infected SARS-CoV-2. child may infected asymptomatic contact and, cases, child caregivers may even know infected.

It seem like we're seeing places . fucking scary. Reasons: Equipment shortages. literally equipment test faster. Places ordered machines months long backorder. 

Personnel shortages: need trained medical professionals safely collect label samples, need trained lab techs run accessions. Hypothetically lab space, necessarily bodies run tests.

Reagent supply shortages: Since everyone else planet also needs stuff, massively back ordered.

I'm part team trying help increase test capacity here, we're delayed *yet again* stuff arrived. I’m blaming either side. I’m saying protests sports. Protests mask lockdowns allowed proceed well BLM protests. two fundamentally different activities subject different types government involvement regulation. Remember clamoring requiring idiots sign COVID waiver denying healthcare participated high risk activity. Guess there's need now... Waiver Approved. He's going tie checks unemployment corporations sued COVID related negligence...and he'll get it. She’s PhD think shows going church social activities without masks away work get everyone work sick.

Other restaurants likely religious people believe science working them, normal people. Lmao people literally insane say isnt real fairness rest world can't see either. College education 1:1 relationship under-funding education...

Not mention greater feeling self worth college educated individuals could contribute mask wearing without related actual funding education. Hey well, gotta pops mean retarded enough believe did, going convince otherwise work ER. But, patient claim cannot breath let unmask procedure Whelp guess there's creative solution had. impossible figure handle sick people. Pack boys, let's send home die. Welcome America. said nearly 100% remote workforce? least three .03 ifr people 45. 

It quite possible ifr real outbreak circulated among age group. 

Of course, isn’t likely, possible. funny see new Vantage credit score model 3.0 basically give weight medical debt.... bad we're willing ignore problem. AT&amp;T said stopped paying, stopped using service. Also, it’s important note less costly providers likely use AT&amp;T towers. cheaper companies don’t go plant own, that’s far much capital. I'm sorry loss. think COVID would flat-out gone close UNLESS full isolated homes 4+ weeks food delivered automatic drones grocery stores/restaurants everything able stocked produced manner well. able find every single case quickly like upon first symptom happened contact trace every individual contact enforce 2-4 week quarantine every one individuals perfect accuracy exceptions. likelihood us able enforce something like almost zero. even account EVERYTHING professionally cleaned, preferably automated robots. guess instances? symptoms show Tuesday morning, honestly clue called doctor clinic, set virtual doc visit, went through, agreed need test. Got link account set test, wait Thursday. results next day(negative, days can't careful). 4 days initial symptoms, results. 

Now know places advertising 5-10+ business days, ridiculous. many people stopped giving shit. hear talk “new normal,” virus “may never go away,” figure might well live virus Beat funny word, everyone knew second wave coming shut begin with. Maybe everyone, knew Gotta hold vaccine Yep. shirt, shoes, service rule. business create almost policy want, like “we serve people wearing red shirts”. It’s private property serve anyone want deny service anyone want long isn’t discriminatory protected class (and “I hate masks” “COVID hoax” protected classes.) understand classifying much covid deaths should... 

Like someone dies car accident covid, count covid death... Anyone good knowledgable diseases know they’re this? seems weird country got lucky also acted quickly first case appeared, going strict lockdown making masks mandatory everywhere, outside inside. low number cases new cases long while. However, made everyone complacent, restrictions got removed, people stopped careful all, even much maintaining social distancing queues anymore. cases again.

Obviously US far even consider never proper successful nationwide quarantine, us had, we're coming realise one-off thing. can't nail stay safe forever. sprint, marathon. government talking possibility another quarantine now. think people sunk yet ne reality, something we'll live years, maybe even decades. vaccine nowhere close yet, things take years, case even clear yet people gain long-term immunity. could put economy hold months once, almost nobody objected saw necessity it, happens again, again, again? Sure, government absorb costs, indefinitely. Entire industries like tourism, sports performing arts might go extinct. It’s hard feel much coming sides bottom. mask fitted well face I’m aware isn’t perfect method though.

Here detailed mask analysis you’re even talking about? Schools close time flu. soon many kids staff flu, close manage it. looking number... Could provide source?

For me: excess deaths stat tell real impact. Unfortunately, reviewed well fact 8 week lead time death record. analysis rather policy. i’ve come understand people argue anything proven immediately small room speculation. applies specially fields rely statistics. Flying plane crashing plane doesn’t really rely statistics. layman crash plane 100/100 times. goes untrained driver, surely wreck car they’ve never driven 60mph highway. physical activities observations confirmed high degree confidence easy replicate. 


Now comes fields like medicine lot experiments new medicines rely heavily statistical significance testing determine drug works not, people become speculative. E.g. drug works 95% patients, 5% work effectively, got unfavorable mild reaction drug. anti drug gangs throw arms air full study. applicable many fields rely tests. always? Cruise ship + jail + meat plant = highschool Wow, hot take, fit perfectly Trump's coronavirus task force. mean, even slapped face 140k deaths counting, still ""no worse flu"" people. Exactly!

I’m also pretty sure majority would understood hey, economic crisis result virus wouldn’t totally fault.

Instead fails react pandemic, worse needs using countries opening metric, thus economic impact virus extended exacerbated. actually Trumps fault!

To say stepped toes understatement. fucking dropped slab concrete legs. worst part course is: still stands solid chance winning 2020. making joke around choice wording.

You're absolutely right crack virus - masks - without police. 

You can't arrest, issue summonses, charge someone crime without police. 

This crackdown would entail. Holcomb talked civil penalties fines mask violations though may ultimately end final Executive Order. He's talked violations Class B Misdemeanor, jail time criminal fines.

Funny note, despite Indiana's Attorney General colossal douchebag, he's issued reasoned opinion Holcomb power Indiana laws Indiana Constitution actually issue mask mandate criminal penalties may moot point altogether.  mean, meek mill.... Unemployment numbers often hogwash. 

Several states offer 12 weeks unemployment. people already kicked aren’t necessarily working they’re ineligible. r/Coronavirus Redditors sound far malicious girl. can’t count number times guys celebrated corona death political consequences. hahaaaaaaa - eat shit. im fuckin life party. think AT&amp;T reward us pay? think new “tax” coming future months get missed payments back? It’s made worse tik tokers live (alex french going around us beaches wearing mask) Covid big enough problem shut economy cancer larger one people still claim provide protection wearer... science behind mask isn’t difficult comprehend look tucking country even sub assume must teenagers think they’re experts reading couple articles cells. It’s like, pick lane? idiots believe science fits cute little narrative god forbid anyone critical something like, like Dr. Fauci, apparently public health, like politics, team sport thing matters side winning.

The essence scientist critical fucking everything regardless personally feel it. like Dr. Fauci, respect Dr. Fauci, even knows (whether he’ll admit not, public comments say won’t say personally) absolutely provided cover administration essentially nothing assumed science would win end day. Science lost, he’s shoved dark corner, thousands people died result. 

I’m chemist two decades experience working pharmaceutical industry. Entirely many kids sub role playing scientists that’s part problem too.  Isn’t story 6/10 think schools reopen kids physically present precautions place?  mean costing less? Yes, true. shifting goalposts. I'm talking winning elections, crafting legacy. current state economy massive impact reelection odds incumbent. Tennessee also feels like titanic hitting ice burg. Daily. No, dictate response first place, lie obfuscate virus month lame attempt boost stock market re-election.

Selfish self-serving always. person right, can’t forever. People sub acts like anybody isn’t 100% staying lockdown months possibly years time selfish asshole stupid understand virus. isn’t Ebola, isn’t Spanish flu, isn’t measles, smallpox, polio, it’s virus kills three every 1000 people contract it. It’s worth keeping country shut indefinitely.  that's low, money work done. sure people think money comes from... People like Jake Paul. Private house parties. Rich people used law, didnt realize law nature trumps human notions money power.

Plus, outside major urban areas, much CA Alabama Pacific. Lots cases early repatriation flights  KNOW! Next thing know, they'll forcing people wear seatbelts driving, ban smoking inside buildings, require take shoes get body-scanned boarding plane! say Americans watching right scared?"" Alexander asked. Trump immediately fired back with, ""I say terrible reporter — that's say,"" told Alexander question ""very nasty"" put bad signal Americans.

Even given softball questions, responded wrong way nearly every time. missing point, many accidental times places get situation breathing hard impossible. every day 8-10 hours. I’m good physical shape completely idiotic think mask can’t negative impact people working hot humid environments working really hard. bet haven’t worn mask 6 hours straight working 90 degree humid house air movement soaked sweat. Let know bet won’t call us babies. expect children able social distance wear masks day parents won't, monorail sell you. love you’re basically telling Americans fuck (rightfully so) true Canadian form still managed apologize even you’re right. horrifying fact slowing moment. pro, assume sedation drugs different simple morphine.

Or no? Thank comment sorry dude/dudette. long think takes make 300,000,000 doses new vaccine? Yet.  NYC rallied behind hospitals everything could

Yes, including coordinating get ventilators.

Abbot's effort obviously half-assed.   fair, first study suggested dangerous retracted serious questions dataset fake. sure data since shown higher incidences heart problems, lack efficacy.  Seems huge black hole missing logic going around right now. true lot Asian cultures, workers realize working greater good society. Specifically, hospitals large infrastructure projects, making iPhones. Flu trending way February (CDC data) relatively non-fatal flu season compared previous years (esp 2018). sure drop-off much early normal though. I'd need go back look (when time).

COVID deaths start appearing March. even tinfoil... many anti masks movement sites seemingly popped night mostly joint White house effort directed abroad shut Thank you, I’m glad add form entertainment life, seems like need 😘 Well need train equipment recertify per faa 

And unsafe training department unsafe flights  That's helpful, thank you! Yeah, I'm sure could think something ;) feeling able see awful, feel completely powerless. That’s 104,000 death Americans till election. Even Biden takes power.

This going bad Excellent point well-articulated. Dammit Ron, get reddit Norway? Finland? Switzerland? Ireland? Scotland? Netherlands? Especially latter - ideologically somewhat USA European countries regarding individualism egalitarianism could touted good example. 


Well tbh size class ( Germany) really compare France almost 15 million people less. That's much difference Switzerland Ireland half Scotland people.
 

Can't really speak NZ tho... 52m little comparison potential lost lives things happened slightly differently money spent. People bad logic. something end wasn’t needed doesn’t mean shouldn’t done all. It’s like mad put seat belt didn’t end getting car crash. Lawn chairs Gorilla tape it. Take country irreparably damaged either way. take long time fix. bored talk positive! Look bright side hundreds thousands dead! Could millions! Billions! Trillions! Hey fucking NorCal, too. may fucked deserve points one, either.  COVID hoaxers want know Dems hiring Crisis Actors. Yeah weird, it’s almost like capitalism cares next months profits half point more...  Yup. First Wuhan, Lombardy, New York, now... why? one cares trauma inflicted doctors, apparently. used work major airline another capacity, two years ago jumped opportunity start training fly living. Now, CFI checkride two weeks absolutely flying jobs horizon. I’m trying find non-flying job industry ride downturn bloodbath hits market also disappears. really fair excuse since Europe reacted accordingly. Especially Italy, everyone realised serious acted super fast. We'll almost everyone, US get memo.. wedding celebrations started 6 days ago. haven’t heard anyone symptoms yet, we’ll see attending 100 guest wedding good idea not. still doubts would admit it. Only? That's 1 10 many. telehealth appointments. think charge damn much though. like $125 10 minute video call. Violates patient privacy  ... CBD shops pretty much stayed open pandemic places. get wanted go lazy worthless young people thing but, come on. Expect Texas 200 again. Deaths probably surpass yesterday. actually lead fuel expenditure cars less efficient speed

Fuel economy entire point 55 mph limit. Efficiency drops 55 mph increase wind resistance linear. never again, cost lost time productivity. actually save fuel though.  Norway Finland equal lower rates share land borders Sweden, one highest burdens infection Europe. island may help, necessary. sad thing full travel ban right thing do. ""CHINA!"" travel ban, initially ban *all* international travelers every port entry without prejudice. Mandatory (not voluntary at-home) quarantine 14 days travelers hardship waiver. tests became available, prioritize screening incoming travelers. Maintaining extremely low case numbers since first signs disease abroad would meant contact tracing isolated cases slip would feasible efficient. 

It would sadly play xenophobia, consistent ""America first"" platform he's along, *it would consistent way freaked ebola* none would change position Trump. top off, would acting advice scientific community increase interdiction surveillance borders.

In many ways like dream situation him. He's always isolationist germophobe. needed focus protections foreign ports entry we'd even better situation New Zealand, US would emerging much stronger international position before. would pushback February maybe March people calling xenophobe, right thing always popular thing. full nature virus clear, Trump would actually getting plaudits international community making USA example countries follow, right thing instead popular thing. issue everything said following: great evidence right masks effective led believe. Sure, every often study article come telling us effective masks are, data conclusive really speculation point. mask mandates happening throughout country really show, governments look like “doing something“ combat virus. Masks also become politicized, right views wearing masks infringement daily lives, left views masks way show world much smarter, progressive, enlightened conservatives demonize.

If masks effective, places mask mandates shut downs? masks good led believe, couldn’t everyone wear mask resume normal life? Couldn’t make people attend NBA game long wearing mask? Hey, every single person arena wearing mask, what’s harm?? It’s yet one example horribly contradictory information concerning virus.  say uncomfortable. pointed reason people oppose it. 

Compare today generation world war ii, lot things made uncomfortable. rationed food, blackened windows, carried gas mask, took war bonds, donated valuable toward war effort b

Today, heaven forbid make wear piece cloth quaratine I'm sick. violation rights. 

It's going while. Listen Carter malaise speech apparently destroyed candidacy. making shared sacrifice greater good (i.e. dealing oil shortages environmental degradation).

How many business people complained CERB Canada 600 UI top people quaratine get bigger paycheque must pay fair wage. Now, multiple hotspots, spare healthcare workers. Also, know multiple doctors volunteered NYC, think single one would traumatizing

I hardly imagine wanting bunch fools like Abbot imagined fit governor. 

There's mask mandate Michigan since July 10th. I've trying email mayor asking something like this.. hell, even asked something simple mailing residents known information virus help make better informed. first I've heard state mandate masks hoax really convincing That’s rest world thinks think we're missing going initial viral load dictating severity disease, entirely intuitive makes sense. start 10 viruses would take approximately 7 doubling times body reach 1000 viruses (all numbers completely made up). Let's assume 12 hour doubling time (again, entirely made up), 3.5 days. So, start 10 vs 1000 viruses, body extra 3.5 days start mounting response, would result significantly better outcomes.

So, could give population small doses (like vaccine...) would go away. problem controlling exposure. That's go grocery shopping mask, even exposed, outcome predicted pretty good. get spit on, sit 8 hours cubicle beside someone positive (even asymptomatic), shit going suck.

So things like prisons, expect viral loads relatively high infection, expect higher IFRs. tell fuck off, math Borderline? Trump joins Cleveland Taft one fat presidents. bigly awesome fatness Omg finally someone whos nothing. I've argue kids masks. newborn can't wear mask Brian!! can't go buy food I'm food. anyone watch kids. Shops deliveries nurses elderly neither. Things happen. always excuse. leaders attempting thin population letting people get evicted die corporate greed. Drag don’t right thing. need help. greedy help us every right take back money. God hate upvoting stuff, people need aware.  Im speed limits life saving tech I’m masks social distancing. It’s shutdowns don’t make sense me, think analogous shutting roads. seems weird. Why? think wiped reelection prospects I'm sorry might quite disappointed November... still lots support ppl ask questions plus Russia going want Trump stay power Ok Kim Jung Ill I’ve literally stuck delayed plane almost 10 hours without allowed move food drinks weren’t allowed leave plane delay kept going going, going offer us voucher future flight end it. shit happens. Whenever see news story like Reddit young person dying, look news story pictures deceased always obese woman. 

Often times news story even mention comorbidity healthy. Obesity comorbidity Exactly this. mention easily manipulated insecure soft little mind is. China Russia manipulate like puppet is, stroke tiny little ego tell smart, big boy is. sheep-like followers clue literally tearing apart foundations country. part community eludes you? Florida doesn’t half ass anything. freedoms taken away made wear clothes? follow traffic laws? DeSantis makes bullshit statement trying legitimize conspiracy theory motorcycle deaths sniffles getting counted covid deaths. 

Today continuing rapid approach 200 deaths per day. get spreading conspiracy. borderline obese

What mean borderline? boyfriend tested positive COVID-19 around month half ago tested negative. test took rapid swab test go way nostrils therefore 80% accurate. reason, nurse assumed result false negative advised quarantine together apartment (my boyfriend's roommate asthma seemed like responsible choice) 2 weeks plus one week waiting new results. time around, regular swab test supposed 99% accurate. got results first tested negative, thought would well, tested positive. started think maybe gotten virus since Europe January therefore developed antibodies, would explain tested negative twice. However, antibody test came negative! now, even confused. exposed possible (remember boyfriend) virus 24/7 almost month half, keep testing negative without antibodies? something wrong tests administered Florida? immune system something looked COVID-19 research? It’s hard believe people hospitalized pneumonia tested COVID.  flu, no?🤥 safety covid? Duh! US *did* handle badly, well? saying difference American people *also* fucked up? Today decision day guys. fuckers barely ever work Friday. comes Kaboom?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""strongman"" revealed mean ""weak-minded man,"" rest world already knew.

Weak-minded, emotion-driven leaders terrible fighting pandemics.

I figure fighting pandemic like programming computer. There's right way wrong way it. error program, screaming feels good actually fix problem. Sitting figuring problem tends helpful. Nope. all. 
 
I feel like joking. less control let slip fingers. That’s addiction works guess that's idea faith bible comes bear. “College graduates likely report worn mask time (76%) without college degree (60%). education gap spans racial groups. example, 79% college-educated black adults say wore mask time past month, compared 67% blacks college less. fully 85% Hispanic college graduates report regularly worn masks vs. 72% less-educated Hispanics.” Maybe happy hear catch 95% likely completely asymptomatic chance dying (assuming care health 50 y.o) probably around 0,01% OH! But, people still get flu shots, social distance, wear masks right? want sound insensitive, mean, I've taken every precaution I'll ""probably"" fair better right? shoot carriers *of* virus Really states actually control right took action. states spiking right Republican states refused fuck all. Cuomo definitely deserves criticism early moves get virus control. Don’t forget weird military deployed various US cities good reason.
Edit: military, federal agents identifying themselves.

Edit 2: can’t see problem executive branch deploying federal agents democratic cities without request running cities willfully ignorant. Unbridled power one branch government never intended. Uk 1000 deaths per day peak. Florida \~1/3 Uk population. still less 1/4 deaths UK peak. probably right, ethics challenges real. candidates get approved production starts, scaling even more, hear discussion it. Glad watched video......I expecting something along lines devices become sentient attempting wipe human race virus.

Or maybe are. y'all would stop looking behind doors beds boogeyman, might stand better chance dealing shit show happening house. competent administration would still run testing issues FDA CDC bureaucracy, stubborn Americans would still exist. rhetoric would different, outcome.

Unless think young people, driving surge according Dr. Fauci, would listen Hillary Clinton tells go lake bars. “Folks like you” 

I’m chemist two decades pharma development experience. You’re ignoring months spent talking masks don’t protect wearer, around them. bad information continues proliferate among “folks like you.” 

It’s impossible ignore contrast tone Fauci speaking behalf White House Fauci, relegated internet, giving far bleak realistic forecast future virus. I’m sure think vaccine coming year too. Spoiler alert: 0% chance. cater kids I'm mistaken. Fun fact: Texarkana, TX closer Chicago, IL, El Paso, TX. 

Also, driving San Antonio Phoenix, El Paso half way — meaning half drive entirely within Texas. 

Texas fucking huge. weeks ago someone said impressive US put together 10,000-unit hospitals worst NYC's outbreak. obviously tent tarp-divided units inside convention halls stadiums. all.

China built real hospital (actually 2 IIRC), made mostly pre-fab units, 10 days. That's amazing is, even *having* many pre-fab units put together one location short notice pretty impressive. matter?

You caught spreading misinformation virus order get people killed. It’ll still gloomy coffee friend multiply get 1x0=0. Victory! Good job people, let's get back work. Phew, could use golf, winning exhausting. I’m socialist, wouldn’t camps. sounds like problem... least you’ll surrounded maga idiots like yourself... maybe pro-America instead pro-trump

s/ basically Apple stores reverse [Waffle nobody knows true hospitalization rate, includes you. means knowledge required say *nowhere near* 1%.

It's word lol. hilarious. Absolutely gut wrenching! worst part know thousands people already downplaying death due victim's weight assumption tied existing comorbidity. Millions Americans underlying illnesses; many undiagnosed. Every COVID death tragic. Doesn’t Brazil make ‘good’? good representation virus spreading fast, POS author talks wrong cases spiking deaths it’s going brutal, yet decides stay Florida leaving New York (probably contributing spread virus epicenter) even worse keep son tennis camp cause wear mask? Really? That’s insane, fucking understands problem cases spiking yet thinks precious tennis camp invincible it’s convenient posted right people East Texas post Facebook small comparison cancer, TB, flu, etc... area plague shops there. quite. places? Probably. estimated 28million people been/are infected us. depends area.. cant assume 1 = 13. American audacity say Mexican, people would screaming. Agreed. people took upon wear mask sick, transmission rates would reduced. alone prevent human hardship/death provide cost savings healthcare. fact can’t find aren’t yet publicly released mean longer recorded.

Do think people tracking things quit? right. We'll hearing *MANY* kids getting infected and/or dying within weeks schools reopen. I'm terrified.

There's way I'm sending kid back anytime year. lot people overlook without confirmed test cannot diagnosed COVID. symptoms weren’t severe enough test (which problem time) diagnosed upper respiratory illness. COVID also plethora things like Bronchitis. diagnosed upper respiratory illness counted COVID cases. Doctors weren’t diagnosing people COVID money. diagnosing people upper respiratory illness could still quarantine even though couldn’t get tested.  returning August. Late 50's early 60's Everything don’t agree lie! way I’m never wrong. Properly fitted n95 (etc.) masks indeed personal protection.

It's silly tell people things like ""you'll need hazmat suit."" People getting infected Covid virus soaking skin. 

Keep mind us live areas *extremely* low mask wearing compliance. Implying something ridiculous wanting protect oneself is, best, unhelpful.

Using appropriate (e.g. n95 better) properly fitted mask - perhaps coupled form eye protection - along usual avoiding going public possible, trying physically distance people, washing hands, preferably removing dirty clothes showering upon returning home, provide *excellent* degree protection people.

No measures offer 100 percent safety. there's lot ground wearing hazmat suit wearing crappy cloth mask. Sadly one times Trump seen consequences actions, lack thereof. create duplicate patreon call VirtualCollectionPlate. donated local food bank honor. hypothesis Kushner source leaks. Projection   say though. addresses media situation comment  I’m critical care physician - health “expert.” absolutely worst nightmare. They’ll end foster care brought home infected parents grandparents. mention long term effects virus. idiots short-sighted.  Christ, imbecile. I'm sure teachers happy hear *guaranteed* die. Yay exponential growth!  lower population density fewer international travelers counts response now. room board? Meal plans? Technology fees? Rec center fees e.t.c? Generally speaking, school starts second week September, starting weeks earlier. reading title thread, ever clicking it, r/ExpectedMullaney. I'm surprised scroll far. 😂 😂 😂 Mitch thinks 45’s reality distortion field protect hammer comes unwashed masses baying blood. Darkseid said best: “please take come”


Folks want work, don’t want die, full stop. viable treatment/ vaccine one gonna risk neck chicken feed. Folks think usual suspects contained govt crackdown knowing friends neighbors tar feathers pitchforks

$600/wk supplement keep someone home fat happy way cheaper spend $$$ security ammo ability sleep eyes shut. Crazy guys jump defense country actual concentration camps citizens think USA likely tamper numbers. China literally killing whistle blowers, shady things like fire want compare two. China king hiding truth. make crappy attempts everyone see past. Keep defending country enslaving citizens 2020 Oh seen exact headlines tho? much california case reporting, preserve quality data case positivity % etc. 

My county dashboard warns people data preceding 5-7 days change test results come added. regional subreddit daily post someone helpfully creates table show changes daily case tallies going back weeks. think Belgian waffle joke subtle. Reddit scientist deaths per infection. multiple NYC level spread events going right we’re slowly reaching NYC level deaths overall. isn’t win, it’s say less people dying. Why? Combination Flu covid-19 weather turns colder dryer, thus helping SARS-CoV-2 stick around longer. People also inside more, virus tends better infecting people. 

How bad? Probably now, spread places seen big impact.  sub ridiculous lmao Mitch better money!

Not Half!

Not Some!

Mitch better cash! live red, rural county California. go dog park people actively said they’re worried Covid walk right / past you. 

I back away they’re literally stupid would worried they’d cough said something, I’d clock police would come.

It’s rude, aren’t always there, I’m careful near them, god damn ignorant stupidity painful. hit 3 million earlier July heck job, trumpy 🙄 Unless comes completely undone.. let's say Trump like politics. rip apart go back way was. Thanks link, love watching morons parade. sounds like live shitty place. Got test morning results 1 hour clarify point ""ahead print"", pre-print. usually means paper passed peer review (or case editorials many journals, simply editorial review) ""accepted"" journal, yet typeset (marked HTML fully styled edited PDF) assigned issue, journal uses issues. point, review would happened happened. absolutely failure part editor permission accept papers. I'll add perhaps another perspective look at. I'm former Catholic (not even Christian anymore) know MANY nuns, good friends. often unknown tidbit US, nun awesome way woman get great education *and* climb ladder field, especially education healthcare. Women literally founded vast majority Catholic hospitals schools throughout nation. Leave aside whether agree tenets Catholicism moment. Hundreds thousands women entered convent went gain PhDs medicine, mental health care, medicine, etc. founded, serviced, RAN institutions. noticed lot read obits nuns die local convents convents family associated with. Honor faith, nah. Honor living life committed often helped lives others. Yes. like honor healthcare workers teachers today. 

Also, society homophobic recent years becoming nun one way lesbian Catholic girls could get expectation marrying man kids. Certainly desirable option, hey, better nothing. 

Edit: think stereotype nuns mean teachers slapped hands rulers comes women really want nuns anyway shape form, chose get married, big expectation girls Catholic demographics. Hence, turned bitter. true kids can't get it. true kids less likely die it. girl's tragic death change fact.  Well rona can't taste anything long. is? It’s pathetic. buddy “essential worker” taking care trees brush around power lines. He’s maxed foreman guys got laid making hundreds week

EDIT: downvoted? don’t agree you’re gonna leave wonder don’t? come downvote, explain I’m genuinely confused. literally experience, talked 3 days ago it’s fact hope buying lies. want students enforce mask rule saying ""encouraged."" hope going shocked students get sick campus actual plan keep us safe Laugh Vietnam 400+ cases zero death sharing long border culprit China near 100 millions population Could?

It like, ""are kidding me?"". metric shows average percentage hospitalizations die daily basis? 

So, example, 100 people hospital 3 die, hospitalization death rate 3% (at least day). 

If extrapolate average would probably better metric estimating deaths basing positive test results since testing rates vary widely. [Surface contact major vector know virus linger, 14 16 hours? seen reports.

Weird flex, okay Well, is. time everyone waffling local clusters trying decide measures take, ran away them. 
 
We've moved well beyond localised clusters again.
 
And that: appears politicians highest level government afraid electoral consequences they've delegated responsibility taking measures local level. 
 
Lastly, seem trembling mere mention something resembling second lockdown. 
 
It bit shitshow. speed virus propagates underestimated time politicians.
 
Luckily we've got good virologists (that stopped listening to, seems). food wasn’t specifically designed lab cause addiction, obesity, profits would right. “personal responsibility” argument literally food industry came with. brainwashed thinking bad guys can't get enough tests done hell going get vaccine millions? long DT POTUS take vaccine, continue wearing mask it. going disappear need vaccine? There's nothing borderline obesity, crossed line long long time ago. blustering done southerners texans, macho patriotic shit, bullshit. scared apprehensive people ever met. never leave back 40, tote guns everywhere project strength secretly terrified everything.

Once realize behavior facade cover cowardice makes lot sense. Call J.G. Wentworth. snowbirds quarantined that's fine case many arent quarantining. Alot canada considering shutting due outbreaks. sucks gradually, proportion number cases. worst still over. safe, there’s need hysterical. told virus miniseries OVER! LAME

*unsubscribes* Still waiting dead people streets. buffoonery God PRO-social distancing  sure downvoted, correct phrased good-faith question. Opiates alone used sedate people. like framed question. girlfriend tested positive twice. First positive june 19th. Second positive july 14th. tested negative twice June 30th July 1st. Hasnt left house much besides going work July 13th. Yeah living like living. answer there, like answer Cancer Ummm yes know now. even scientific peer reviewed research Can't blame Trump all. world over, people proven idiots expect spoon fed.

It's exactly Nobel prize winning science understand basics virus as:

* needs host
* spreads people different geographic areas mix
* invisible droplets spew mouths
* ventilation dilutes virus/enclosed spaces concentrate it.
* masks contain droplets

I think human race lost ability think, people's brains exist diet social media little else. literally throwing ""Covid parties"" see get Covid first (and win money)? work give shit. care asses chairs. show run emotionless formerly private practice female employment attorney. total asshole. Ah, many fellow liberals Facebook started complaining them. course want discard comment Reddit pop-up UI! Sheesh! Yeah true, forgot I’m gangster  Yeah, they’ve probably busy experimenting Uyghurs past months hope people live spoke city future flights secretly hampered lack routes carriers. know specific studies showed this, surely pass along, right? know studies suggesting economic loss time lead deaths, seen one showed lock downs cause harm good current state affairs. sort issue. thought countries successfully tracked traced early killed spread. 

We since learned another, unknown, variable disease stops spread hits certain point. 

We don’t know factor yet. 

There lot studies preprints released trying figure out, none conclusive, downright silly. 

We don’t know yet. also true. countries way better US, without masks. example Denmark. even masks 10% effective. effective all... risks outweigh benefits landslide. Wear piece cloth face outside home possibly save thousands infection. even debate? selfish be? Mind boggling. Hard say. choice terrible either way. guess comes person deciding. vote want one make decision.

I want vote I'm definitely interested so. also seems like year matter vote fucked either way. Dear condescending foreigner-

Glad finally paying attention figuring stuff out. whole time know exactly going on. Read article    Yes now. Adding mean anything. shows virus completely contained fought eventually wiped out, nations right thing. said clients, it’s narrow sample size you’re implying. d6ing 91 makes better? person beat one worse diseases humans TWICE. killed disease less severe contain able. Fuck Yup people category won’t conversation rot requires accountable actions choices least cookies breakfast. aren't. see total number tests reported linked Florida DOH report.

I believe we're seeing number *new people tested* decreasing, i.e., total test number includes people tested negative multiple times. underestimate retarded lot Americans are. I'm still encountering people early last week still ""Do really think Hillary would better?"" ""Biden/Trump corrupt"" messaging. They're majority people encounter, I'm red area. listened podcast week interviewed social scientists Montreal psychology mask wearing. Two interesting things noted. First, tends men 25 - 50 yrs old want wear them. Second point unrelated thought interesting - compared resistance masks resistance people safety measures, like seatbelts example. Apparently resistance always happens initially, road becomes second nature. ***P R F motherfucker: it?*** 1 10 Americans completely lost plot Everything recist dog whistle far left.

Nah, mostly stuff racists say. isn’t surprising, little kids least half listen mom dad. Teens desire independent adults brains kids. lot infections March/April tested for. Back really sick got tests. Realistically would easily 200,000 cases day peak back then. can’t attest I’m college better yet football team university amount teammates travel places party go house parties, random people mind boggling. example one teammates two day house party rented Air bnb public invite sent social media weekend. recipe disaster. meant Covid relatively easy minimise.
Unfortunately cancer not.

I know even comparing two. 

One person cancer run risk spreading potentially killing others.  #DicksOutForCovid car analogy, well-intentioned, it’s really relevant pandemic. Seatbelts obviously show, clear, hard evidence seatbelts save lives, clear discussing masks.

Yes, masks politicized right, left think much worse politicizing masks. left uses masks badges honor distinguish ignorant, anti-science, redneck conservatives demonized.

You simply wrong conservative people thinking “damn, it’s Democrats trying control me.“ shows like everybody else site. actually even know conservative people? know said you? People don’t want wear masks uncomfortable evidence actually anything. State governments concerned appear politically, making masks mandatory state sure fire way gain support liberals. Whether masks actually anything. wording fucky late. police security religious admin follow protocol. k ow 2 people one died. 50% death rate.....

Do need drop /s???? Rhetorical question. 

Since are, sounds like medical conditions would make wearing mask prevent proper breathing. Well, we'll build wall get 'Muricans pay it. all, sending us best people. I’m saying lot reference timeline 30 40 days? given understand majority deaths happen 50 100 days diagnosis. conclusive average now. anyone science this? whats mean? ""Normally"" bar here. ""Eliminated"" is.

Copenhagen looks operational, idea ""normal"" certainly ""eliminated"": Oh, positive going difficult kids actually learn anything. care much safety putting school - learning made up, life cannot.

I'm super glad able keep home. know many option whole situation clusterfuck. probably right.

althought squares well really sum 2**(0-63) shorthand perspective 2**64-1, quick answer. head state quoted Terminator 2 March address virus. Probably important political speech adulthood, certainly career, and, well, go. I'll get shot, wear mask, social distance! Yay common sense decisions! :D “Instead let narcissism wipe re-election prospects” 

Yeah, don’t let thing happened 4 years ago happens gain. Neat edgy. take you’re teacher? Austria, sports back without vaccine, virus still active, problems all.

Even gyms back full 2019 mode, although closed may. fair ""dumb dirt"" ""dumb doorknob"" categories money?

He’s getting lot grief people cottage (in Ontario) quarantined arrived 3 months already.  This. said necessary, splitting hairs made worse. 

Presymptomatics think they're asymptomatic doctor tells otherwise. 

How happens. Someone feels ""something"" tickle throat, slight fever...  goes away quick came...  shake less 24 hrs... shrug off, ho day day..  bam... someone else home gets hit hard, know. 

My point, people lot incentive tested. interrupt lives...  late.  ""We need suspend payroll taxes wages higher"" sir independent contractor place(s) work opening date sight, think I’m means medical professional, actually learned decent amount viruses biochemistry student pursuing degree pharmacy.  sickens right are. get actual laws real enforcement mechanisms

Why would think that? states blanket mask requirements, ones do, workplaces, general ""must wear mask public"". sheriffs publicly announcing enforce mask laws state mandated, governors refusing require masks all. conservatives want accept medical experts science says.

We effective vaccine actual mask laws enforced every state. It’s actually really sad. 

Like someone else said, could easily secured re-election. could pointed Fauci CDC said “Yes, listen guys.” instead he’s turned wearing mask something political believes he’s smarter person worked SIX presidents become expert field. Seriously, ""you must read joke discussing article"" great 2020 feature. listening Fauci thought 9 months possibility; clear going take years.

Now think 3 year global timeline; rest world continue status quo? (Hint: ends everywhere) like lily pad example better shows suddenly things escalate. one lilly pad. doubles every day l, day pond half full full 30 days. 

A lot people say 15 think it, ever answer 29. 

Basically every doubling must endure experience growth period others combined. people struggle weight. do, do... Ignorance bred looking keep us blind wage theft moral bankruptcy. can't arrest, issue summonses, charge someone crime without police. 

Important note, changes EASILY made without police. necessarily need arrest enforce masks. would go treating similarly enforce quarantine orders. Which, admittedly, well, that's due lack surveillance utilizing (cellular data). definitely charged people police well. power given others well. like police know law clearly barrier entry gets charge crime.  Wow wrong information yes reinfected covid Reddit page even posted many times happened people past two months alone recent one saw yesterday even guy got right recovering three months gets they've even said immunity lasts 3 months experts claim experts STAY SAFE TRUST MASKS SAVE LOVED ONES PHONEYS MAKING STUFF!!! Oh, think man made. Yikes bud disposable model hold global pandemic. time manufacturing leaves supply chain thin cannot stockpile enough throwaway stuff either. worried replacing sales. one cares profit, survival. 3 4? 6 months pandemic US?

i shake head. oh shit....rip lady. people please wear masks...  Look buddy, I’m American, it’s pretty clear Republicans ones disobeying social distancing mask wearing. It’s Trumps fault showing leadership. Claiming virus “disappear” absolutely nothing stop travesty. 

Republicans need get shit together, often good people good economy. don’t see way though, see what’s bad people good economy. Completely mind boggling. Mask life winter.

A different inconvenient truth. 14-15 days, depending article publication date look at. 2 weeks go 3-4 million. backlog, didn’t plateau 3k-4K cases day instead going down?  Sad. one important other. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* endless terribly forced unclever puns. Indeed: “These kids got get back school.... get COVID-19, — go school — they’re going hospitals.... They’re going go home they’re going get it.” 

Gov. Mike Parson, Republican. 
Literally wants kids die home. swear saw exact article two months ago too. still one listens. easy answer this: far lot less entitled morons many states pushed recently, hell article sham calling girl young vibrant obese fuck... actually think one besides boomers die this?? 

Tons drs nurses died. ""strong willed child"" couldnt go stores could climb everything. Im giving suggestions either take dont bring kids dont to. way protect children best can. doctors appt soon three year old wore shield face mask, little bribing fine. harm asking question, right? 😂 Reality well known liberal bias Part horrified. Part fascinated 8 doublings fact. open first place? data available obvious.

They open control instead letting greed fuck us over. 

Again. course, definitely pants. Watching apple stores foe people dont understand dont care numbers.

We apple products. trust apple make good products. assume smart people make smart decisions. apolitical product.

So apple closes store, tangible action scary. similar emotional effect knowing somebody tests positive. Still, juxtaposition corporation's imperative make money contrast religious institution ""left-leaning"" best ironic worst malicious. need make money mean can't ethical it, mean need stoop level killing people so. can't say wrong make arguments it, I'm really sad say true. vent hope someone sympathize.

The worst part nobody really cares. exist least five actual levels leadership could prevent school opening, failed so. Federal, State, City, Board Trustees, University Leadership, possibly student body, ever held water. Every single one failed act, either refusal consider consequences, desire ignore even consideration, actively hampered another level. least three levels bound morals profit, religious university nonprofit, last three ought well. like I'm advocating total erasure university's existence either, hundreds millions dollars endowment, something that's enjoyed 10% growth rate bull market past 10 years, least. endowment/student ratio greater cost tuition four years college, including extras like room board. One semester without extras may cause lose money, amount (after actually looking university's financial statements 2019) sufficient quantity actually jeapordize operation future. global pandemic christ's sake, really difficult 0% growth 6 months? 

I feel angry take mandatory classes catholic ""heroes"" risked life limb face unreasonable odds, refusing money praying Christ inordinate amounts time save people Romans, Spaniards, English etc, university faced similar situtation turns tail hides finances matter people's lives. university spends millions dollars advertising campaigns teachings form young ethical people, yet cannot apply ethics themselves. kind common man able empathize people's conditions may boon applied single individual, institution cannot apply morals itself, institutionalizes ignorance morals, undo work good people. matter turn 100,000 students 50 years educated morals masters trade, actively make impact present make sure 15,000 people's lives put jeopardy. podcast it? Keep gunning collapse. Isnt flashing gun someone law. Like charged assault guns taken away law? I'm sure agree lot politics, I've listened many daily briefings definitely comes across competent wanting right thing. issue statistics misintetpreted media outlets (eveb reputable ones) means novel occurancs. Science always badly reported on. Adding contrasting opinions respectable scientists due novel nature virus, qestionable data comes early epidemics fact outbreak heavily politicised. advise look primary literature official data sources (although may great). great epidemiologists active social media currently may interest best speak truth Yes. police sheriff enforcing laws. 

“On Wednesday, Klickitat County Sheriff Bob Songer, previously refused enforce state laws recently featured New Yorker magazine, also blasted Inslee’s order interview Oregon Public Broadcasting. “  TL;DR

Health Issues US

Obesity = die

Life cruel general shit happens really incredible continues fall sharply countries followed shutdown mask strategy seem mostly seeing second waves. WHO's point clear manipulated media outlets. discussing good news effective contact tracing programmes work asymptomatic people tend spread disease well, meaning people develop symptoms get tested contacts notified isolate spread disease pre-symptomatic phase. 

The amount shit got true statement atrocious. Americans start taking seriously going left behind rest world, remaining lockdown rest world begins resume reopening. *the parts world nukes yet

China Russia expanding reach military force even US sends strongly worded letters admonishing them. Thanks, Greg Abbott! South Carolina changed hurricane evacuation plan year due Yes would've pay people work, includes black people. Paying black people work exact opposite principles America founded upon. went party knowing risks sure. Sigh. 🙏 best time get obesity control years ago. second best time now.

Best luck you. believe Obama 911 framed Saddam Hussein. would realistically mean we’re worse March/April. 

I’m saying aren’t. I’m saying argument would true. rhino. elephant. Which, think, delicious irony. Obesity stacks deck hundreds health risks. America unheathy first world country world. EcOnOmY started backtracking Stopping interstate travel possible feasible local enforcement mandates is. similar to, “no shirt, shoes, service”. craziest thing this, happened really hi lights old saying history repeats itself. Although wasn’t nearly many today, people resisted certain measures Spanish flu.  Fuck normalizing bullshit never will. Deaths expected peak sometime next week. case peak 6 days ago takes 7-14 days deaths peak cases do. Please wear mask mouth *and nose*, sir. what? no? how? ""negligent"" (in common non-legal sense term), walk thru could possibly rise threshold murder. unbelievably stupid. look like snitch. Covid would've largely contained he'd cruising towards reelection right now.

Even contained, would appear could could *much worse*. AZ apparently huge backlog tests. think numbers suspect. explaining would elect someone like that, easiest explanation. Chinese operative. Funded Russians. Everything's great, right Toots? european countries fine-ish. 3 orders magnitude new daily infections can't make much difference, right? /s  jokingly mentioned friend America setting lose 5% population ago. I'm starting wonder joke going become reality... mean, highest leader active testing problem.

Just much testing, can't test enough. think sub overestimates relative size comorbidities versus age. Age far, far bigger them. Orders magnitude. Yes. serious. lost two friends Covid-19. age 40. dad's nurse survived ventilated six days, lungs badly damaged. doctor calls ""Covid lung."" He's 28. He's also evaluated blood clotting disorder now. 

We're going finding soon longterm damage Covid-19. Bro, Dems even TRIED suggest UBI, GOP senate would scrap second. GOP don’t want pass relief, dragged tooth nail pass $100-
$300 supplemental UI $600 ends. issue getting relief, take senate, reason relief bill needs scaled back. Worth mentioning COVID survivors ~~are also banned~~ could potentially banned joining military. going feel echoes virus long, long time.

Edit: misspoke, sauce below.  ""incredible amount""  one report... making string similar ""errors"".

By way, anyone else noticed errors go one direction - making things seem better are?

Amazing it? almost like intentionally fix ""mistakes"" called them... Viral Useful Idiot even deal virus effectively. Everyone already low opinion him, even pretended care virus politicize it, would've seen poll numbers skyrocket.

I mean, Trump already enjoys advantage bar lowered much him. guy bragging passing dementia test, people content laughing him. anyone else done this, would attempts remove office, citing would mentally unfit. army Karens cant win. ‘Overweight’ risk factor severe COVID-19. 30+ bmi talking that’s closer 40%.

Remember took 4th populous state month reach 1000 deaths/day? Remember last week 3 populous states 500 deaths/day? 

Why Americans desperate pretend day wake *this day*, time, *last day* numbers ever change, base conclusions today's numbers today's numbers only! lack education?

One commentors informed daily cancer deaths around 1300 Statewide positity rate 14% (roughly).

Not good. Yes agree. still implement rule bring waterbottle/beverage mask sips. I'd fine rule eating anything flight together, exception verified medical condition. Stay track Donnie. didn’t lie. made clear time made decision. absolutely bad decision many died result lot blame go around front.   One person wearing mask amongst 9 people far vulnerable 10 wearing mask. Yeah patronize establishment agree every issue. basically never leave house. jesus christ people pain pigs saying is, almost deadly cancer contagious. realize fucking scary is? Oh hes definitely clinically obese, theres doubt that. data still fucked. know people (within last days) gotten test results matter hours still ER, others 9th day waiting test result. depends lab use health system operates through, well testing method varies system system. USA? people would lose weight, crazy think simple. know frustrating non-American look recipes online? Every recipe unnecessary sticks butter heaps sugar create portions far larger 99% population consuming single meal. Hell, American sized portions take borderline mythical quality, they're bloody absurd rest us. get part culture, ultimately indulging shit personal decision. illustrate point, getting General Mills cut sugar put Cocoa Puffs Lucky Charms really change fact kinda fucked people think acceptable give kids chocolate candy breakfast first place. without addressing elephant room incredibly sedentary population.

It's really easy point finger bogeyman, point time there's need honest introspection. comment there. nuns siblings, friends.

But news like offer vindication many oppressed life religious believers.

When even morally best us ravaged biological parasite, additional proof live material world, protection imagined deities.  everyone fights right freedom(no mask) Walmart everybody spreads 50 mile radius Okay, 1/8th people expected die today marked covid death. 

Interesting, hammer everything looks like nail. I’m eastern Washington.. little girl get tested. got results back 4 days, still long ask me. Ya know, citizenship status, would good thing put census, it? we'd need know often every 12 years. Census would say, Pick apply:
* fully capable working job, either part-time full-time
* fully capable working unemployed
* retired
* disability
* receiving disability support applying (SSDI? everyone would know acronym.)
* members household XYZ work status...

I've lost job stopped counted unemployed several times still looking work. reply wrong thread? u   Good thing fowchi know wtf he's even talking about. guy contradicted many times over. get fucked. problem south. live San Francisco one success stories (knock wood), right public testing sites busy, can't get appointment weeks. hard show facts people adamantly believe CDC, WHO, every independent Institution Agency provides data corrupt lying. inflating numbers name game. 

I send message Conservatives know still think ""see truth"". None replied back *their own* sources:

Why would inflate numbers? gained literally anyone so? Businesses failing, unemployment time high, Economy scraping by. anything - downplaying numbers save face time. 

Oh ""Hospitals get funding COVID-19 case""? mean, funding would get maximum capacity, losing staff, blowing Oxygen PPE, able remain open, clean, sanitary Millions Dollars elective surgeries bring every quarter? Doctors, Nurses, Lab Techs now, right? 

The Relief Funding they've receiving literal fraction Operating Costs necessary major Hospital facing Pandemic magnitude. people dead second day row. ~140,000 reported deaths thus far. ~4,000,000 confirmed cases. US alone. 

Any credible independent source back up, obvious slight variations Data Collections. Recent estimates CDC (which compiled 26 different Sources, Institutions, Organisations) project spikes death rates come fall - especially Schools reopened. Trump neither 6'3 239 like says. 

He's closer 6'1. Obama 6'1 height even taller Trump standing next other. 

So even 239 like says, 6'1 he's well Obese range. way he's 239 though. Aw man.. Bernie chomping bit tell us how- ehem- EVIL MEDICAL CORPORATIONS CONCERNED PROFIT

/bernievoice India fucked crazy. Projected they're getting 300,000 new cases day makes lot sense 45,000 new cases day considering densely populated super many deaths? Almost many Italy. Shutdowns necessary mostly can't trust uneducated people take precautions.

Uneducated applies many supporters Trump and, case, children. U.S Governments poor handling Covid 19 big enough joke though. used live Alberta...the local paper would print editorials opinions blew mind. Super different mind set prairies compared live B.C. Precisely. jinx it. feel matter time Northeast sees rebound. can't big outbreak rest country without leaking back. internal borders, people trying return normal. countries like Japan, Australia, Israel, Spain, parts China, etc., may go two months resurgence. hope second time, ready, enough testing capacity, people sufficiently alert second wave kept small.  I've looked numbers able find them,

Well, let's pack boys, /u/TangoForce141 find numbers, must longer exist. bad find it, hopeful deaths still recorded somewhere. So, new evidence food transmission, one car look, again? thought best thing employers won’t give time unless actually test positive either risk fired, take bunch unpaid time off, go work anyway. rolled eyes far back. upvoted. get pregnant don’t take pregnancy test, happens nine months? find disturbing economics left conversation. jobs United States facilitate enough exercise throughout one's work day, even one standing day (food service.) many people simply time and/or money plan meals cook healthy meals scratch.

Sure, choice healthy, really viable someone working 2 fast food jobs trying care kids?

Did know phrase ""pulling bootstraps"" used joke army? (Because impossible do? ) described nothing new among said people. situation new, that's it. I've thought too. Trump could easily ""America's Hero saved us pandemic!"" he'll remembered president change thing thousands die. food hot enough kill viruses bacteria. weren't, people would dropping dead salmonella. Arkansas quietly high case rate per capita. read bit relaxed proper precautions always predicted this.

When folks head inside pubs public transport autumn flare again.

In UK dense population England smallest houses Europe. ripe another flare here.

Looking countries France Spain, flare since relaxation social distancing. UK worse weather either countries folks mixing indoors. worth two days bathroom floor least. $20 US Government. Feds providing free citizens. someone rolls 4’5” 10 year old like uh yeah he’s 2. Doubt. U.S. worst world every metric, everyone would claiming overreacted. Shit, even hear people say bullshit lockdowns overreaction. know tests actually accurate? Yes thread people dying virus sent home. case, coming in.

And, case, best thing everyone wear masks home. You’re cool wishing death low wage fast food workers views upper management Well, don’t care mild cold cough back late March actually got, recovered from, immune (and can’t spread) coronavirus. don’t accommodate you. Seems like won’t agree, considering state open, I’ll continue enjoy life. problem risk coronavirus, take steps want take. Forcing house arrest actually violate rights. Opening schools stupid idea. way predict outcome worst case scenario bad. PRC cinema food prices quite bad. Probably like 2-2.5x much pay normally. don’t know I’m vocal across many platforms.

I guess speak myself. read Robert California's voice. Ask louder little rage back room want shove grandpa grandma oven 'go back normal'.

Sorry whole thing love fellow human beings really getting me. 

It's apparent lot people put many things front lives others. Fair enough. Maybe kind rule anything 4.5 hours service food drink. 

That’s would eliminate majority flights. There's almost point getting tested anymore can't find positive covid 2+ weeks test date. 

If assume positive self-isolate two weeks relevant. employer requires come lab confirmed positive result everyone around gets fucked over. People thinking past got thinking critically, imagine. eating sufficient infection, someone spoke preparing food? auto industry going shrink regardless do. 30 million unemployed. Wages DECREASE. market flooded used cars due repossessions.

This going get ugly Source?! clarify 

its 85 age 2. 52 age 1 33 age There’s percentage parents just...don’t like kids. people posting Facebook don’t care happens, can’t take anymore, they’re sending kids back school. 

Same kinds people complain summer kids home &amp; can’t wait school start again. 

Same people SAHMs put kids daycare don’t want bothered.  seems like bunch people ones running university. seriously one unnecessarily stressful, scary, shitty semesters I’ve had. Instead moving online instruction they’ve basically set us (dorming students) germ prison three-four months virus airborne. really good monster truck rally Indiana last week.

They handed free masks everyone, enough room people sit far apart other, outdoor could roam wherever wanted.

Maybe 12 people wearing started, got hot I'd say one two people wearing end it.

Which fine stay away people, absolute mad dash exit staircase near end everyone pushing past, shoulder shoulder, trying get out.

AND MONSTER TRUCK RIDES bottom stairs, everyone pushing stairs, coming trying stand base staircase stand line.

It clusterfuck.

I actually one guy tell buddy redneck accent, saw mask, ""MAN, MASK PEOPLE FUCKIN' STOOPID"" friend laughed said ""YEAH, THEY'S LOOK DUMB TOO""

and sums trip Indiana. I'm back home east coast quarantine. crowds people parks beaches aren’t ideal, it’s better bars restaurants least. closed yet? someone similar body type, assure you, well obesity. explain state could post large quantum positive day (the headline generating ""Florida highest case day ever!"" type data), time un-fucking data account test delays (as ""biggest ever"" number FL cases represent people asked test last 24 hours, rather number people tested last 1-2 weeks whose results finally showed last 24 hours.

so bad florida bad texas is, headlines reflect OLDER picture case growth, things likely worse today (and worse, know weeks.) money made mask far less would made winning second term Another term ""whataboutism"" ""referring precedent"".

The US government invented term ""whataboutism"" always believed law thus accept held standard everyone else, everyone else held standards set.

In legal framework, ""precedent"" means justice applied equally all. US' geopolitical framework ""whataboutism"" means US avoids held standard everyone else. Oh look Confederacy, lmao people voting this?  NWO.
the take USA still great country, would used resources wealth really squash home.

We could national mask mandate WWII spirit greater good.

Therefore hospitalisation rate children somewhere 0.17% 0.041% overall, assuming they're likely contract virus adults (that may case children &lt;10, appear less like contract F.P., Reed, C., Lim, T.W., Montgomery, J.M., Klena, J.D., Hall, A.J., Fry, A.M., Cannon, D.L., Chiang, C.F., Gibbons, A. Krapiunaya, I., 2020. Seroprevalence Antibodies SARS-CoV-2 Six Sites United States, March 23-May 3, 2020. medRxiv.b

This appears credible, Case Fatality Rate among children Florida 0.018% (5/28,000), inferred IFR 0.003% 0.00075%. 

This similar IFR UK children, suggest figure Florida close correct course did... give f*ck.

But, taking Serbia example, even second wave, less 1/10th deaths per capita Sweden has. 

I think ""If kill bunch citizens now, die later second wave"" good policy. passions seeing friends family, traveling. Merely existing life. think considering difference human response Coronavirus there's managed number infections going insanely exponential huge numbers. react. That's humans do. mother went several surgeries week ago, took covid test monday, got test results following morning went hospital.

The worst part that, Trump fucked badly, he's throwing Hail Mary Passes instead sound policy can't ***hurt*** politically right now.

So yea, virus control US, maybe pushes schools reopened, something might happen turn around. goes shit, well, already pretty shitty situation begin with. skin Trump's back, care?

It’s website pushing preview image, I’m going guess. (So fault shouldn’t reason remove post anything.) know cant lockdown travel rest world? 

These people greencards valid visas US citizenships. 

You're gonna tell people evacuating Wuhan cant go back home country? time Fauci knew, millions already left. 

But locked country enough slowed spread, discouraging normal new years travel horde. Sure theres kinds variables could shift things youll never get 100% infection. point napkin math like give people better feel numbers. lot folks dont understand incredibly dangerous getting 1% infection rate is. 1/100 odds seems safe till 4 months 1/7. 
If 65 think death rate corona like 1/5 something similar, means 4months youve got 1/30 chance killed virus. 
In 8 months theoretical “100%” chance infection meaning 65 US would safer next 8 months play Russian roulette six shot revolver would stay US. 

Infections wont cleanly grow like mathematical model, deaths (shit go ham hospitals get fucked end next month) make tge numbers relateable. 4million infections difficult wrap brain around 1/80 isnt.

One thing keep mind, infection rate accelerate increases size becomes harder harder come contact someone sick, eventually becomes impossible. saw doubling rates 3 days early on. means go 1% 100% month. signal noise ratio sub pretty bad, try one moderated vein /r/science. subset people want serious discussion, find small communities offer want. large community overpowered large 1% idiots.

Clearly not. Nearly 3000 died seasonal flu 2018 told ""conservative"" forecasts least 40000 people would die virus, forecasts even predicting deaths hundreds thousands...  
  
Plus stated goal internationally used ""flatten curve"". memory holed new goal ""test many people possible keep cases 0"". utter senseless stupidity. jfc, every vaccine side effects, mean stop giving vaccines people? bc minor side effects? ridiculous. New York death rate charts.

Yes. They've already got hump. that's possibly New York first place hit coronavirus US

Florida Texas point time handled far better New York Conspiracy theorists welcome science driven community effectively leading indicator, technically one.

While Apple closing based data get, effect leading indicator actionable indicator precedes newspapers and, unlike press, free political bias. Oh Jesus bad Man maybe thisll take care anti vaxxers wait it... nothing happen they’re teens virus proven affect young people way older individuals. Yet, people throw comments around like, “better order 20 caskets” without knowledge numbers say virus. Stop picking kids want live life everyone knows CFR less 1% based current world data mental health impact based *perception*.

These perceptions exacerbated talk radio capitalism evolved.

Both existed prior 1978, fyi. Yea seasonal summer flu get yearly shots for......

What fucking idiot. Kanye, you? Democrats center/right. confused think that. Democrats LEFT, democrats much left others democrats left think single county Florida hot spot right now. Every single one closed. I'm pretty sure competition actual meth head. 

Murica. likely herd immunity factor here. New York New Jersey cases deaths dropped dramatically worst hit places country. Similar patterns seen countries, densely populated centers go first peak first go first too. Yup! see deaths started lockdown started. doesn’t match. 

Though, know people beyond saved logic. doesn’t mean everyone uses arguments is. Nope. massive case outbreaks areas protests. literally listened. So.. yea did. absurdly high death rate per case suggests tests barely catching tip iceberg. isnt even funny, either... suspected. Also, thank sketching rational, science-based reopening might look like. Sadly, live society actively denigrates education cultivated expertise. fear, American teachers, students, school personnel heaped sacrificial altar Economy, praise unto paramount munificence!

&amp;#x200B;

As school officials sleep, back-to-back Zoom meetings pretty exhausting, especially glass ""water"" actually vodka-tonic. Sure is. put effort willing pay fair price, buy used.

I sure would excused slavery back day well reason. Looks like brain implosion thing.. People like reason virus spreads. Keep eating burger boy gotta get obesity argument going DEFINITELY HELPS. y’all barely open Florida open whole time yet y’all managed catch exceeded Florida matter couple months vs 8 months Florida open. Explain that??? **I'm 1,000 calculations per second they're wrong** cesspool* kind assumed start US would high death rate start hospital bills. far large developed country's does, aside healthcare systems overwhelmed one point.

You guys good reputation healthcare, afford insurance actually covers it. much world need worry cost though. trust stat person know spell ""influenza"" correctly states tightening back reopening caused increase unemployment, something pretty much everyone predicted.

Who could known?  forget us, essential forced work peanuts insurance. government broken everybody held seat 8 years needs removed. tired seeing men decades grow old rich tax payer money spouting ideals 1960s - 70s young. Fresh blood revolution fork road USA approaching. Why? pubmed merely repository many studies?  yes 

keep going - blessings problem Trump though, reality liberal bias. experts advice necessitates liberal policies, biggest proper shutdown would require strong social safety net. They're worried essential workers get taste ""socialism"", willing go back minimum wage jobs. point it'll taken hands local/state governments force stop playing games positive test results multiply. traveling squads 150+ people, playing stadiums country, see outbreaks basically inevitable.

Baseball good test run... they're also using bubble system, limiting travel significantly much smaller groups travel. safely maybe NFL chance. outbreaks, it'll way worse NFL system. Eternal brain fog federal government authority make drinking age 21 every state either, apparently authority cut federal highway funding states didn't.

If federal government gave fuck could find way. Except doesn’t say haha based letting blow herd immunity threshold pretty high, pally American politicians trying spread infection? genuinely don’t understand Please people buy Oximeter. They're like $20 Amazon. family party believe lot restore religious influence government, often gets left Reddit discussions. also working memory capacity linked non-compliance social distancing guidelines early stage coronavirus outbreak

edit: I'll also add there's nothing stated subreddit rules jokes allowed. That's case r/science, makes sense context. add rule here, said, I'll follow it. Yep :/ Anyone sue anyone anything realize that. People online condescending. Barely California locked months whereas Florida didn’t still managed get amount infections deaths. California failed. 35K dead NY. would say NY absolute worst response. think deaths matter. opposite ""flattening curve"".

Ya wonder dont control now, everyone died past spring! think may testing delays. taking lot states 2 weeks get tests back. peak daily cases likely higher 77k, know them. defending Mike Pompeo here, exactly forth coming coronavirus response either. leaders complacent right incompetent. Humanity doomed likes Tedros. half million people's meaningless death head Tedros, may never leaves conscience forever. talking about? math pretty simple here, 150 days left year, 1000 deaths day (this average way high) would 150,000 deaths 775,000.  
As hypothetical, let's say give 10,000 dollars could guess within 50,000 deaths number total US deaths COVID next year date (July 2021). number would guess money line? Seems vary testing center. 10 minute results advertised Houston metro.

I know two people actually got tested week, one results two days told 6-10 days. Yeah, delete lot stuff. It’s pretty annoying Get outta stats downplay virus. That's allowed subreddit. Oh boy inconvenience, schedule appointments go them! side effects!!!! one's talking side effects!! potentially bare fever headache day. I'd literally rather die.

Putting mask sooooo much work too, though. choose whether order one online create own. ordered find box cutter, used thing ages though! check every drawer house til find it. actually open package, cutting tape top SIDES. open mask probably even wrapped plastic tear apart! I'm taking break point I'd probably already died exhaustion. Ok, I've finally removed mask packaging. what? telling lift mask face wrap around left ear, right one two??????

Seriously, sound like second paragraph vaccines. plenty experiments showing affect oxygen levels. impossible. volume mask. Claustrophobia whole category. mask still though, hyperventilating fear mask. even states mate? can't blame Trump. entire republican party voter base complicit this. embodiment voter base, think lost support republican voters. agree. matters believe, actually do. Finally, another person gets it. think would prefer participate economic arrangement participate benefit slave labor, market appear made available us. Wake vote. Tell friend tell friend believe it. recently? Things already seriously scary.
If reporting deaths home, sending home LOWest probability living (as per article), home infect others die, we'll continue multiple waves sickness death something changes. 

Will us trying responsible live caves indefinitely? careless &amp; anti-maskers either died / developed immunity / became asymptomatic carriers​, vaccine​ helps hurts. Yeah, let's blame protests, people go grocery shopping refuse wear mask rights. Lmfao rip US would trump administration anything system benefits him? case know reality works, trump's hands anyway. Listen American, patriotic duty least 44 pounds overweight. That's nothing, small children 44 pounds overweight. Yep comparing deaths NY/NJ isnt right.

There's thousands sitting skyscrapers country breathing recycled air, 150 people travelling play outside much? employees getting paycheck Best Buy deserving employees NFL? interesting Texas 29 million people 4,500 deaths comes 157 deaths per million.

Canada, 37 million people 8,870 deaths, works 235 deaths per million. already monkeys didn’t get reinfected iirc Trouble people think gamed system taking 3hrs finish half coke. Apple would actually turn ability read Pulse Ox, would save lives. know FDA yada yada regulatory bullshit, cares anymore? Italy still bit 580 dead/million, Sweden 557 dead/million. 

Really large countries like US Brazil can’t really compared smaller countries like Sweden (or Belgium even UK) comes death per capita. Viruses doesn’t spread different rates depending population, take longer larger populations reach numbers per capita smaller countries. Looking individual states, parts US definitely hit worse many worst hit European countries. Like dumb swedes? never understand thought ok reopen state barely month outbreak. going bankrupt already crappy economy.... criminal. Greedy ass companies like also part ever stop. Wow, either u/Arula777 sarcastic, got really really unlucky picking one cabinet position that's occupied physician. Guess we'll never know.  Oh right, forgot magical barrier stopped teenagers passing virus anyone age 20!  definitely think wearing mask sick great permanent solution! personally dont think asymptomatic mask wearing last seems covid specific problem. Look every state hit hard back spring. see death peak lags case peak 4-14 days. Except admitted lie relevance ? Canada plenty people mindset. Also Kemp too. Setting aside thoughts timing restarting MLB season, think actually like this. watch lot baseball, including recent spring training games without crowds, strange. game atmosphere big part experience. Plus security team probably dealt worse things anti-maskers. talk doctor. Reddit doctor winded coming stairs pulse ox reading 94 normal.  Nobody cares point CCP spread virus everywhere. China complete nightmare country end. Outside China stronger inside China.   Easy say. people would followed CDC guidelines mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing braying MAH FREEDUMS. arent leadership ?

Hell, park navy hospital ship coast Houston least. know Reddit hates emojis 😂 Good luck! r/loseit really useful sub, especially info side bar. basically shipping containers. real hospitals sense word. job though, gave sick people beds helped contain spread sy traditional style hospitals. sorry must deal bs behavior customers working. I'm point fearing public spaces. Omfg America, going let potential infant killing mutation virus spread? ... Jesus fucking christ man I'm saying mask babies, mean...young children spread too, spitting coughing, touching....eughhh. One reason avoid children pandemic, potentially school bad enough. strategy opening India back up? thank fuck, live Ohio scary see full parking lot Walmart nobody wearing mask  realize contradicting yourself? ""But I'm bored, kids driving crazy, need haircut, weeks since got Margarita Mondays Applebee's!"" America monarchy.

There local governments, federal institutions lot bureaucracy. 
There's also whole private sector.

And course, people. them. written hospitals (or physicians matter) make final decision?

Low level thinking... assumes positive tests today actually reflective disease three weeks ago hate state too

kansas gang ww well ppl Wow, someone guys proud! upvote Fanta menace cancel reopening, stand back blame protestors,

You both. Reopenings absolutely cancelled able happen slow measured manner supposed to. See Hell, Michigan soon protests started, Whitmer pushed reopenings *forward* week. anything. can't stop protests make measures strict minimise spread covid.

It’s height hypocrisy allow one group gather large numbers without repercussion turn around try shame another group people thing. It’s even worse try absolve responsibility spike cases warned about. Good luck getting anybody buy whatever measures proposed. Look temper tantrum people taking wearing masks. I'm actually working lengthy piece literature ""Trump years"" America. There's old footage Republican primaries Trump saying people die streets elected president. happens, loss words. o.O I'm saying teenagers can't thoughtful intelligent fully aware cause effect. I'm saying personal level, regions brain govern *personal* risk versus reward fully developed, play major role decisions like this. 

I expert here, familiar research. would get hospital? would drive themselves, ill would call ambulance, people would...? Certainly thought COVID-19 wouldn’t asking get close quarters avoidable. better what?

France got hit early. hard react. still good job things considered.

Germany one lowest death rates per capitia European country. really hard expect better.

Its virus. People going die. sad unavoidable. thing control number deaths. Unfortunately, Sweden failed properly control that. Lol. literally said people shouldn’t wearing masks. End story. Sorry exalted Dr. Fauci isn’t infallible  site says likely 400,000 day US 1/3 size India. relatively better. course India rise still....well numbers get control. anyone asked, enjoy people inject little bit humor heavy threads—it kind helps cope gravity. 

I say that, though, make point also empathize people want stay topic; there's lot frustrated requires serious discussion cope. appreciate /u/ohmyword, others like them, voice they're sick it. internet forum, all, people drive culture. Reddit, social media platform, good job giving positive reinforcement content-driven memes, rather serious discussion. that, require commenting opposition shape community way reflects want spend time in. 

If Reddit removed positive reinforcements, intentionally implemented—make mistake, like upvotes, rewards lack reporting downvotes, think culture could driven back serious discussion often wish express way.

I problem anyone getting upset uptick jokes/memes. I've Reddit long time (longer current account) natural progression popular subreddits—sometimes beneficial, times much. think refreshing see /u/ohmyword speak mind *and* get upvote support. Helps break echochamber bit. Hey, think get handy go bed? No, zoomers pretty great. majority deaths centered around cities protests? Bruh gone coordinated leadership aware later half January already. remember specifically taking precautions wear mask plane day Kobe died. would known government point? 

So, no, even worse pointed out. additional month tackle prepare tackle this. fucking dumbass charge kept telling base would ""disappear"". 

We country prizes last minute intervention emergency rooms cheaper preventative care people. know surprised happened. probably pick diseases easily *do* affect mouth. Also much healthier general breathe nose.

All people complaining breathing masks either full shit mouth-breathers. They're babies. problem wear mask 8 hours. Ding ding ding! got winner! Actually Hispanics black Americans likely obese according cdc Anything around 96-100 considered normal. range 97-98 regularly. check daily. buying 100 million right now, option buy 500 million more. Basically ramp production vaccine case works companies minimal financial risk. Overall gets vaccine lot quicker. I've always taken 'seriously' active person 30 feel like personally worry concerned accidentally killing someones grandma. I'm getting concerned hearing lot people near age dying. Even scarier? neurological impacts virus made people nerve pain migraines etc. just, 'Can survive Covid get it?' rather, 'What would adverse life long effects consequences surviving it?' Exactly, plan could spend year hospital pay like 2 grand, pay ass it, I'd prefer higher premiums bankruptcy later Wow, two words, Wuhan China even come close sounding same. 

So say Chinese citizens allowed travel China rest world, actually prove wrong saying nobody allowed leave *Wuhan*. Yet people town see Murphy Hitler lol. Proud Jersey girl! I’m pretty healthy 31 year old wanna know truth. I’ve living paranoia months now. Seeing articles healthy people dying at/around age actually making way scared panicky, fucking reason. Regardless anything, everything avoid Covid, everything possible. want know truth know concerned paranoid be. Making overly scared isn’t helping it’s effecting mental health overall quality life. “It's reasonable assume protection time frame one three years.,"" says Florian Krammer, one scientists study. ""But course, scientists. prove that, right? That's everyone's cautious it. think that's pretty fair assumption.""

God hope he’s right Ah, didn’t catch that. 

I literally want understand point is. Nothing more. one: surprised pikachu would risk it? surge isolating work, would been. Np! Like said, there’s still room scientists learn virus results gathered, though understanding spread always difficult since neither people outdoor environments subjected controlled studies. saturation undoubtedly increases risk, keep mind lot protests actually moving well helps offset risk. (I don’t personally know large protest wasn’t actuality march, though I’m sure happen.) Sunlight likely kills virus (link below), there’s also compelling evidence well masks work curbing  state brutalizing people (very, illegally) kidnapping street. 40% country - ""small government"" folks - applaud. Meanwhile head DHS unconfirmed acting principal officer. cult goon.

We well authoritarian rabbit hole. would make good president. agree saying It’s hard say could done better, claim expert. think federal response unified think lot fault Trump example initial border closings correct estimation ripped (to fair probly thing done helpful) following petty spiteful unified response needed (that excuse predictable). think restrictions allowances consistent. federal government made huge mistake initially said masks weren’t helpful (I know prevent shortage healthcare workers believe mistake maybe worst one). specific case Democrat gov failing overtly miserably NYC told infected elderly people go back nursing homes (I think mayor governor really pissed him). thing think important recognize people change actions small amount possible. failures republican states: locking down, mandating masks, etc failure democrat run states imposing rules strict people refuse follow follow none rules. actually thought California’s response quite good; early imposed restrictions weren’t insane people would follow still sufficient slowing infections. opened early. Compare Michigan restrictions imposed strict people didn’t follow them. partially fault people well sure stricter restrictions impose logically less people follow them. California able institute restrictions lax people got infected (like republican states) also strict people stopped following (like Michigan) course knowing response would different politician idea coming one prepared like been.   Surgical masks one-time use. couple studies come heating/baking high temps allows reuse still replaced frequently.

Cloth &amp; masks inexpensive, meant paired social distancing better hygiene. It’s better alternative wearing different n95 everyday. understand it’s full vaccine, it’s antibodies help potentially help body fight come contact it’s means full immunity. Thanks, needed reminder. Feeling little bit better today :) Hope well! many buildings recirculated air... looked I’d know, never looked. thank you! thing first peak driven cases northeast second one driven cases south. entire country even wave 1 yet. political bullshit since local government response Wuhan. Bullshit hubris. though? things impossible task vaccinate majority humans. Many experts expressed view virus may stay. could contained it, actively refused worked posibility containing , us humans general west particular what?

I also never lie going parties fucking pandemic mostly cool it. You’re wrong, 300,000 dead December probably realistic. always thought pragmatic. type-o  almost like lot countries test super corrupt. Mexico done fewer tests state Arizona despite 15x pop example. anything, Medicare sure sounds like would help TX right now. Upstate South Carolina. CVS drive-thru self-service test. Still waiting results 15 days. Enjoy lasts LOL no. aren't. remember per capita works? China lacks PR (in many ways China US two sides coin US knows smoothen image better), make ""colonizing"" (certainly colonizing traditional sense word terms sticking tentacles different developing countries making beholden them).

Meanwhile US started war decade ago destabilized whole reasons. 

I know impressed China's slick hand scared America's fall (because believe similar many Americans like acknowledge, always freedom expression factor China). everybody dies something.  Cure one thing another kills you.  inevitable.  question whether worth it. Dozens sharing bathroom dorms. Hundreds eating together dining halls. Thousands around world/country attending classes together. 

So, frats bars could ruin fall reopening. 

Nothing else pops anyone potential issue, parties? maybe bc US, people would bought stock hoards masks even sell increased price. Fauci wanted prevent healthcare workers, time, risk getting covid vs general pop, much risk now.

you know, told people wear masks, wrong masks working, people would still go ""HE LIED"" ""CANT TRUST WORD SAYS"" winning him. Think meant month Yeah, didn’t sound weird read comment, haha. know refer medical doctors same, “he’s MD” etc I’m pretty sure legit well. Hurricane season pairs nicely pandemic. surprise welcome one Reported Im using complex medical jargon. dying from.this comment!!!🤣 dick nose wearing style may applied wear hose mask easy breath “The Death Expertise” Tom Nichols good in-depth discussion phenomenon. ""Tom Jefferson: “Aside people exposed frontlines, evidence masks make difference, what’s even extraordinary uncertainty: don’t know things make difference…. ""

*Completely ignores every country uses masks stopped spread* Veer coming back und cutting johnson Lebowski.   I'd happy micromanaging everybody going bad time. would literally verbal fights every single flight. There's *no* way convince Americans/humans regulate eating/consuming habits unwatched. Plus, even people watched would still break rules. 

Guaranty impossible enforce, pointless try. habits need fucking change us Americans shown willing it. 

The real issue planes still fucking running. 

If plane part problem. That's it. fuck actually fucking plane pandemic? Stay fucking home change habits. *absolutely* airplane? Maybe traveling cross country pandemic, using public restrooms, visiting gas stations, eating restaurants... maybe that's bad idea too.

We still home. Regulating people's eating habits airplanes slap face logic. I’d honestly terrified get again. i’ve sick covid (and likely secondary infection) 5 months now. hell. Today finally feel back normal sure long last. didn’t antibodies , idea antibodies now. However, im going risk reinfecting go docs office get test. results kinda dont matter. dont care bored stark crazy get theres way im leaving house unless emergency. I’ll relax bit get vaccine next 6-12 months.  Discussion starts 4:50 It’s people Florida stupid wants make happy. Huh? find wise use admittedly higher taxes.  No. accept it. think bad want things different.

You accusing holding position hold. motive own. That. Is. Splendid🤣 parents church switched remote services YouTube zoom meetings various committees (it’s Presbyterian church; love committees). shooting early August reopening, pushed back Labor Day earliest. 

It’s really telling drive city see churches full parking lots Sunday morning. Global problems require global solutions. sub worst thing I've ever seen internet. thing is, they're RIGHT lot things. They're insufferable hateful care. Yes, kill poor brown people stopping pandemic? make fortune selling vaccine? works school district supports teachers tolerance policy non-adherence. Nice see state fucking around anymore mask issue. do. know guy brings table. working. Get fresh start I’ve come conclusion he’s stupid. Florida stupid he’s trying keep job. Oh pastor definitely stopped stupid. sorry deal this. possible, I'm sure. Around even see spikes Nevada people calling schools open before, masks social distancing anything. people 100% believe go back normal kids fine going damage different rules virus could ever them. Coronavirus... seasonal.... dumbest politicians America ? Using daily mail source? Okay ""internet friend"" boss.. masters think way. Im translator. shoot messenger. Same. They’d probably tell it’s old injury got hit bird roller coaster. Definitely zombie bite. tell people want lose weight weigh count calories week. look coming from. bad implies peak deaths would correlated peak cases. 

We peaked 38,000 cases. Yesterday hit 72,000. 

Let’s say due factors stated cut death toll half (this would tremendous) cases almost doubled seem sustaining peak longer... 

So even that’s case, I’ll shocked don’t get 2,000+ day. Mortality rate wise that’s still huge improvement March/April, it’s also still huge loss. tough draw many conclusions like number areas experienced level spread few. New York City central northern Italy places know true.

I think likely scenario communities experience situation getting bad, take precautionary measures seriously going forward people do.

Some places saw moderately bad spread like Louisiana Barcelona seeing case numbers grow again, 5-10% immunity seem get job done.

One area watch right Rio Grande Valley US border Texas. seems like place heading toward types numbers. One thing sure. 100 years change things much Spanish flu changed things us, basically history repeat lessons learned... again. 🤦‍♀️ Yeah fact Phil Murphy’s policy led NJ deaths per capita state, great! Spending what? Little open fully. people they've months, better weather. 

Actually traditional domestic holidays spending time, money. 

They may well shutdown like Norway Denmark saved lives. tested whopping 20 kits. What's Confidence interval sample size ""big""? \[-200%,500%\] test kits inaccurate? whole thread saying “it’s unpopular say this”, it’s actually unpopular. someone thinks prevent something would know where, happen, so, bridge sell them. way slow (not stop it) completely isolate, prevent movement assuming virus caught right start imposible escaped lab reported immediately came community spread, would possible stop general terms worse starts community like China, Europe America widespread air travel happens time symptoms lag contagion days like CV19, people would move around further. prevention vaccination cannot vaccinate agains virus around caused economic damage 2% calculation damage cost good saying virus didn’t come China. Imagine politician come anywhere world say, hey cases virus China, lets stop whole country’s economy, isolate everyone prevent travel case get here. course, always, many “experts” tell could done “after fact” actions meaningless. next pandemia could completely different, say example Ebola something transmitted insects want fun projections. ""~~Sandbox~~ American Mode"" interesting pre print showed well: think recent history side trusting anything coming current government. Wave 2 come Patently unscientific, medically sound, dangerous advice.

I hope people find recourse. Maybe sue something. never heard case public officials creating public health crisis, GOP managed it. country though, it’s still really really really rare 20 something drop dead 20s. Covid otherwise. 20s safest decade. old illnesses pop puberty, young long term stuff kill you. 

Unless you’re like immobilized obesity. Like TLC show obese, obesity usually doesn’t start kill you’re middle aged.

Shit, 8 years adult life try get shit together. age. says [people Florida great job need people distancing wearing masks. Things keep improving. many Americans pass high school get GED? lines 20%, surprised number then. I'm sure due general lack care human life, rule possibility infected intentionally feds. say government that's real possibility? preprint published 2020-06-06. 

It discussed [in time.

This use actual study title instead making one up. OP searched sub study title, would found. Unfortunately pretty much impossible change someone’s mind, especially dumb realize stupid are. Shaming prevents others edge falling deep end. Eliminating seems effective way eliminate stupidity, people hesitant go full Hitler issue. remember every medical school person last class. I’ve NJ month July Shore. live South Carolina (my family tested came here). Seeing SC NJ last weeks world difference. I’m almost scared go home August. feel much safer everyone wears mask things seem getting better here. Meanwhile things exploded South Carolina. Sorry, know. cases assumptions. second case *very good* assumption, change PCR can't discriminate viable &amp; nonviable particles.

Pedantic? Yes, science pedantic.

Perhaps agree PCR expensive, sensitive &amp; takes long routine surveillance. need cheap, fast, not-so-sensitive test everyday surveillance, like lateral flow assay spit test. FDA needs approve one yesterday. yeah. live Portland, Oregon still don’t much open. effective cases slowly rise since mid June. anything every state roll back phase 1 begin re-education masks. Who's uncle ver? Yes, Alabama probably industry leader. first make employees wear masks, one places close employee tests positive. Oh yeah respiratory illness always worse July. /s

Someone forgot tell Christmas July means None true evidence Northerners spread virus. individual herd immunity.

An individual either immune, not. person immune, carrier, herd immunity matter still, average, infect fewer 1 person (and that's compounded fact someone infected, viral load low, thus less likely average reinfect someone else). Look bright side: 20% go here, either changing mindset corona, reasons. ""This control, something needs done! NOW!"" -Texas rando

""It certainly sir. wear mask help mitigate infections?"" - CDC

""Nooooo! Freedom never taken away!!"" - Texas rando

""Can stay home whenever possible, avoid populated businesses restaurants, gyms, nascar events, rodeos?"" - CDC

Texas rando pulls 🔫 Yeah definitely agreed. 

I’m striving utopia, think world could significantly improved people stopped accepting shitty things/people telling ‘Oh that’s way person/the world is, can’t change don’t complain.’ Like, many times one say go mature adult coping world, enabler shittiness? 

Thanks talk good day man. corona virus bad almost hospitals empty.

If corona virus bad covid positive people shoved old folks homes 

If corona virus bad nothing done discourage rioting protesting last months

If corona virus bad told wear masks? Apparently face covering do, people could using fabric masks since day 1 supposedly saving thousands lives 

These legitimate questions, instead answers get shouted dog piled. humane starvation/disease occurs predators. cull deer Nara too. 17 think trapped killed 10% population there.

We reintroduce predators start enforcing poaching laws predators. called ""individuality"" another bit miseducation. proclaiming dependent. near max capacity. states getting closer, large majority states, case. Outdoor spread virus much much less likely indoor. husband's company Southern California requiring every person 200+ person company stop working home come back work. People forced work within 3 feet other, bathrooms cleaned twice day, though common areas be. company downplays virus insists safe everyone they'll take everyone's temperature morning, air conditioner day. companies like spread stupid thing unnecessarily. coworkers already said company requiring come back work proof virus getting better, case numbers lies. Oh makes sense. number cases still low 4% increase barely moving needle. Bill who? Technically, usually they're usually taking vacation Sweden. are, holiday business seeing revenue increase. Even Swedes chilling locally, appears spending cash holiday stuff, like fishing. Floridians outside residence 24/7 protesting abominable behavior towards health public? I'm wondering accuracy specificity. taken test. See everyone wants library fully open. deal issues can't imagine adding disinfecting surfaces people inhabit (someone got poop br wall once). Bruh googled tons reports it. shock hospital would get paid dead body? Medicare pays treatment people die TIME. like Medicare pays patient lives. statement seems awful contradictory me. ""Aside people frontlines...."" Well, front line workers evidence enough? election system train people think anything 50% ""majority"" therefore enough term support something, science isnt oponion based, far science concerned, 30% group saying virus control insanly high, high enough keepthe virus going indefinately. Back March April severely ill recently travelled could get tests. time looked like large percentage cases severely ill missed many “mild” (non hospitalization) infections couldn’t get tested.

Those severely ill (hospitalized) decent portion died.

Yes missed COVID deaths way missed amount deaths infections. analogy works nearly mosquitos travel pretty much exclusively large dogs. really extraordinary nurse. outstanding care outcomes. chart patient surveys.

I think well educated professional sense often associated qualities like great common sense strong sense caution.

My mask compliant folks janitor aids undervalued underpaid. get sick, would destroy ways think make extra cautious. No, reopen soon blood hands. Like FL! share studies? I'd interested reading this, thanks. ignore article couple days ago said antibodies faded 72 days. one study says something unlikely, another says possible, think studies disagreed other? There's special place Hell Trump mini-me DeSantis. cri course? opening opening without restrictions two different things. would interested see many would like school happen reasonable restrictions like CDC sent out. right here. love Michael McKean's cameo that. Bill  please explain think useful ignore population size talking death counts would require Lowe’s value customers employees trying pull PR stunt. end day, hiring people role going cost money. means fewer Caribbean vacations, fewer luxury cars, fewer high class parties. look China ties tell shady listen morons post biased news. Like above. know. sucks garage filled Rigid Ryobi tools. believe ppl professionals experts field opposed someone healthcare experience all. Federalism works better culture(s) food industry thinks exact way make ads trying convince American people drinking coke everyday fine. food industry lobbies government focus exercise healthy diet. truth need both. Average rest entire year? No, highly doubt it. rolling average probably get 1000 go back suspect. ask again, got response last time. doctor cited sham ""study"". experiment. air conditioned environment, establishes variables (independent controlled) ""study"" absolutely inconclusive. cited? integrity least perform real study, cite charlatan. Hunters find excuse. already. Spending subdued since March getting boost now. anything people saving travel again. 

It's country. Tourism spending 70% everyone used chilling locally. Indeed, countries like US hack others inspired old lady Walgreens. yelling younger person wearing nose. didnt draw line somewhere would able eat grew land utilize could build hands.


You making good enemy perfect reject moniker.

I wouldn’t go one places either. Indoors safe bet. *”Never underestimate power stupid people large groups.”* - George Carlin decades since news media. Ratings always important, one time allow broadcast time opposing views (without interrupting broadcast) cable FCC could shut intentionally broadcast lies- although think ever shut anyone down, fined them. Now?

May rest peace burying head sand saying ""the numbers wrong"" almost 200 citizens dying day leading?? talking total number, got it. many studies saying entirely possible, people stay infected infectious months. I'm taking away f\*\*\*ing clue virus works. kinda useless stat though, isn’t it? 4 million lot people, want know many *right now*, many positive since beginning. 

This isn’t zombie outbreak. it, isn’t permanent numbers keep getting bigger &amp; bigger. People recover weeks. want know current numbers, aggregate numbers since began. Why? guys running people? 2+2=5 Lord said, Fuck dem kids many orphans 1919-1920 flu.

The point is, parents much control toxic teen behavior, even try best. GLAD toxic child grown live would infect sure, care bit. people like that. how's voting freedum-lovin' fascists working y'all?

Note carefully overlap people telling coronavirus hoax people telling global warming hoax (hint: ""its circle""). Many things realistically boycottable, boycotting Chick-Fil-A smartphone companies makes sense. However, it’s weird think slave child labor acceptable according “moral line”. Nice. I’m happy works family - although you’ve already acknowledged, that’s option many families. Well China already said would free  You’re fucked.

They committed insider trading. didn’t react market volatility, didn’t see wave shit coming pipe. intelligence agency’s said shit could get bad pulled out.  

If briefing would agree unacceptable without content briefing public. 

Fuck hang Well guess got wanted; Americans grown numb covid Isn’t harming deer frowned upon Japan though? I’m sure ties it. system seems work spectacularly certain presidents others. best information excess death data showing year really deaths usual.

Unfortunately, data always lags month more, useful discussing recent trends. NYC peak April, 30% Americans dying week nationally would normally expected. Variations far expected values almost never happen. 30% number dropped 5% normal June, started increase beginning July. Essentially, follows along reported COVID deaths.

Something killing lot people. seems likely COVID, given major deadly catastrophe could explain it. Yeah, I've got friends too. One particular fat, smokes, late 30s, people's homes every day. gets it, he's probably gonna hurting. high one highest per capita death rates world

YIKES doesn’t make sense. daily cases ever before. anything going another iteration already happened March-April, worse. Awesome! Nothing see here. Time open schools!

Governor Rona DeathSentence need start massive Go Fund supply polling place volunteers Hazmat suits. Most? No. Listening Cheney/Lieberman debates (on YouTube recently) ...yeah, going war Iraq whether 9/11 happened not, pretty much flat said debate. Sweden now? Banned neighboring nation, even Nordic Council.. Looking back, feel stupid holding rotten apple tightly? people expected push far nostril testing sites. really uncomfortable, borderline painful see people able inflict easily... Fits I'm seeing. People generally pretty good masking live (and mandatory indoor public places), I've seen alarming number people grocery stores wear one get pull shopping.

Hmm... that's deep question. dont think much honest. thoughts Trump... guess main gripe isnt locking crooked Democrats, media mouthpieces foot soldiers Antifa throwing away key.

Although try get involved politics. Amazon rocks! order everything them. Always delivered. Save much time run store every week. end pandemic asap vaccinate elderly people people pre existing conditions know Yeh, every time see feeling going ridiculously crazy season. can’t wait. go back forth this, want service workers choice either work receive suitable, living wage, know never happen country. case, people eat less fast food stop altogether, employees hours reduced lose ability might support themselves.

I try eat couple times week want contribute local economy struggling restaurants, I'm sure ethical option here. favorite part reddit get block users. So. 
They’re sent home die completely unsupported, painfully, rather horribly?

And ethics committee thinks ethically correct? 

I issues that. really complicated? Told em, ""it is"" attitude cocky fact part younger population die get (still stupid assumption) amazing exactly states expect well well exactly states would well. 

Then mods sub nerve tell coronavirus political matter politics belong clearly political matter politics largely determining lives dies point. Yeah, know requested.

Look it’s like 15,000 mask deniers exact copy-paste story, using snail mail waiting precisely two hours bailing.

And you’re saying need evidence?

It’s friend friend, reason lie. Machiavellian wear mask need people around able manipulate exploit them. offical sources? Sure, people sick though. Interesting point virus attacked private parts instead lungs, pretty much everyone would wearing masks.

Attack lungs, people like fake news! 
Attack dick, everyone like ""mask up!""  *""The Department Health Human Services said Thursday rate deaths coronavirus United States begin fall “next couple weeks.”* 

 *Giroir’s prediction differs forecasts Centers Disease Control Prevention. National state-level forecasts suggest number new deaths U.S. next four weeks likely exceed number reported previous four weeks, according CDC. data also shows rising death tolls 25 states one territory period time. ""*

So one guy reports directly chain, predictions disagree. resembles sound bite logical argument. It’s honestly really nice, wacko’s part people follow rules. heart hurts American neighbors. like usually people say write obese people somehow ""deserved it"" worth protecting minimizing deaths. Nothing 100% effective, still wear mask cut spread.   Working teachers make $80 hour. I’ve read articles poor teachers they’re underpaid broke, barely surviving.
Edit change 100 80 20 percent agency takes. probably 13 yr old kid. 

Just uneducated child idea talking mean everyone else Nobel winning scientists

Other Kary Mullis, else? Name them.

Although I'm pretty sure even name him. NO! Watch video starting 4:50 Last checked shut downs anywhere country...and 1.4 million Americans filed unemployment. Um, yeah, think school important &lt;0.5% death rate population schoolchildren parents. inadequate schooling going cause generation problems. remember sick still partying. one cared. Might bit different now, asymptomatic spreaders, it’s going bad regardless. New Yorker here. Wouldn’t mind building wall around NJ, even pre-pandemic. Terrible drivers, horrible “coastal” people, accent. Geez, New Jersey?

Edit: boo people, joke. New Yorkers New Jerseyians bicker like brothers 10 samples state found positive, found 3 confirm using method. author article apparently added two together assumed group 10 tests actually ones, something like that. math, error rate 25%, 50%. know, we're journalists. find really strange Germany didnt get hit harder, especially Berlin.

I mean .. first fact Germany right next France far Italy, tons traffic Germany across open borders Jan - March timeframe. expect lot carriers coming going Germany, would spreading virus asymptomatically exponentially right?

And also think Germans visiting countries coming back Germany.

And would lot virus Berlin too, one would think. lots people Europe world Berlin.

They say Germany ""did testing right"". dont know. didnt feel different. still tons people getting tested. still 90% population never tested. even April people Berlin Facebook group tested.

And Berlin's famous ""rebel"" nature. whole neighbourhoods basically ignored lockdown. illegal techno parties happening. big anti-lockdown protests street thousands people masks.

*And* 85% Berlin's population living walk-up apartments, passing stairs. Roommate situations common, multi-generational immigrant families.

It kind seemed perfect storm. kept waiting big outbreak story hit.

But somehow never came. cant figure really ..  kept Covid away? Don’t remember tent hospitals set New York? possible county? Doomed? dont know anymore...the division nightmarish. Honestly Dems can't fuckin win orange buffoon dumpster fire last 4 years y'all kinda deserve it. Get vote! worst hit places ones protests minimal. 

All evidence far seems indicate outside, whether UV exposure volume air dissipation, considerably hinders transmission. Conversely, inside office buildings, restaurants, bars, churches seems ideal transmission.

This makes perfect sense bat origin hypothesis correct. bats roost? dark caves, close indoors get wild animals. I’m supposed stay alive dead ancestors?? Haha talk weak shit. depends heard stay home moms complaining able go yoga book clubs. Yeah... highest levels government not, thanks giving another terrifying thing think about. mean - really season year round? I'm Florida. grocery store today person without mask 60 something woman motorized cart. heard cough times too. OP explained Floridians don’t know difference comes number DOH county reports use, number John Hopkins, DOH, chart use. DOH county reports use larger number show amount tests they’ve processed, give explanation why. One possible reason duplicate negative tests, another antibody tests. Nobody able get definitive answer. OP used duplicate negative tests example. OP isn’t making number, they’re taking number state dashboard using it. 

Also Floridaman county example Thursday would 0% positive OPs DOH county report metric Fran would’ve previously tested positive. county doesn’t count people who’ve tested positive multiple times. count positives once, negatives multiple times. However, even counting negative test results multiple times, still doesn’t necessarily account difference DOH reports state dashboard. I'd argue America's unique problems coping COVID-19 direct result *too much* emphasis personal responsibility, coming political climate last decades.

Much population seems believe change habits sacrifice personal comfort pursuit greater societal goal. Anything personal responsibility and/or free market cannot solve, can't do. said would never rural America. “NEW YORK CITY POPULATION DENSITY.”

They failed realize New York also home many best medical facilities world.

Rural America absolutely way prepared this. live student neighborhood Boston we're dreading students coming back, although colleges going mostly remote many may come back, creates whole set issues businesses around here. MIT Harvard basically created campus bubbles Fall term. Bars Mass. also closed likely stay closed Fail. students come expecting parties usual that's happening. per capita close worst Considering kind person wear mask usually kind person take much baggage on, well make lots unwarranted demands, win/win almost everyone.

I hope start end ""customer always right"" leads whole Karen ""I demand speak manager"" BS service workers endure. gatekeep data. Death rate may look like falls next couple weeks. Sure, Explain hundreds thousands subs. 3 years lol? Tf. Don’t doomsdayer sake it. vaccine trials going great. one sometime 2021. Hiding. putting way government.

One provinces awkwardly silence deaths long time someone called seen funerals death numbers.

There one competent left work.

It's accident. called incompetence meeting corruption. think vaccinated? someone considering vaccinated, likely be. think shame fat people. mean counterproductive according empirical research

But also never downplay dangerous damaging obesity one ever accused ""fatshaming"" talking society obesity problem health crisis

edit: point smokers, fully agree shaming understand second hand smoke harms everyone smokers themseves, obese person hurting themself. parents let young children get fat shamed, basically child abuse people blame us negative country. even touch heights... Yes, misspelling social media website communicates partially via poorly drawn stick figures completely invalidates fact dumb reason, 80% population United States resides “on” *border*.

Fucking please. Here's thing: exist, elsewhere. least systems far closer ideal exist elsewhere. America one worst justice systems world. would rather hope better future assume going remain terrible is, know? I'm suicidal pessimist, balance somewhere.

Patients often conditions like heart disease diabetes, controlled would lived virus exacerbate conditions. happens reporting staff decide whether record Covid death not, vary region gets revised occasionally (for example NJ removed probable cases yesterday). Sweden's going without reaching high spike though, actually say that. falling dependent us basically scared shitless staying home Cause eat fuckin mask seasonal summer flu overwhelms hospitals.... Lmao probably 13 yr old kid. I'll stick heard multiple Nobel winning scientists say rather dude reddit thanks didn’t say CFR 0.001%, said 37 million kids got 0.001% died died, would still 37,000 kids It’s science bro. modern food industry obesity problem. Obese people rare literally circus sideshow. Look many food drink companies S&amp;P 500. care addicting customers. Everything made lab kitchen. 

If don’t stuff face unhealthy food government regulation industry? matter you? ancestors adapted **extremely** social animals. degree human beings social **require** socialization cannot understated. lockdowns social distancing goes adaptations evolution ancestors. Telling people around people literally goes hundreds thousands years evolution human psychology. Yup. reddit users derailing conversation marketing slogans. I'm saying cloth mask better n95 majority particles carried phlegm. cloth mask catches large phlegm particles still stopping virus transmission. cloth mask still quite useful. I'm expert I'm repeating CDC website. It’s not. Don’t take word it; check Oregon new cases deaths versus Alabama South Carolina new cases deaths. Found Karen  denying problem exists country don’t think it’s reasonable take hold entire population equally responsible.

I never said equally responsible? certainly would dumb thing say insulting equate people trying part people opposite. 

But we’re least tiny bit responsible boiling frogs passively letting things get point I’m saying. 0.0000000000001% still zero Fyi inserting batteries wrong way first time mess accuracy. made mistake first time getting readings 88-92. got another, brand model, made sure get batteries right first try get 98,99 consistently. Thanks check out, one that? matter much times tell open schools, dont care.

what train teachers online classes better time around actually learn something  I'm learning everyone else, enjoy dialogue.  posted partly bc emphasis sharing food spread covid. another article Guardian cluster nightclub Czech Republic one drink shared among people helped fuel that.

Yes, common sense sharing food drink get sick, see emphasized, general, right people types hang coronavirus subreddit.  He's ever said COULD get control. Trump followers decided listen facts, 'freedoms', we're mom grandparents isolating much possible since March (also Tennessee). They’ve openly mocked, ridiculed, laughed wearing masks go store. It’s broken moms heart awful people towards her. She’s high risk grandparents lives takes care of, infuriates childish people south.

Edit add: even coworkers laughing since went back work (she’s dental assistant) one office wearing ADA PPE. one else is. bar owner's sole source income business? goes under? feed family?  Although speed China able erect hospitals handle COVID-19 patients impressive, highly doubt built North American standards.

The Army Corps Engineers pretty impressive things back April (and possibly on-going since then).   


If federal government several state governments hamstrung due controlled incompetent and/or corrupt politicians (many Republicans), US could truly done impressive things amazing results fight COVID-19. Instead, went different option. must work really hard come ideas look incompetent possible. Meanwhile Cali still ""considering"" another lockdown. fucking hate country yet countries actually bothered treat situation care deserves saw rates go faster. no, good job. Stop trying defend clear obvious fuckup. Y'all isolated separately? #alarmist

Edit: I'm mocking Trump. “Mask ventilator. choice” Abstract

Background: absence vaccines established treatments, nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) fundamental tools control coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmission. NPIs require public interest order successful. United States, lack published research factors influenced public interest COVID-19. Using Google Trends, examined US level public interest COVID-19 correlated testing countries.

Objective: determine public interest COVID-19 US changed time key factors driving change, testing. US COVID-19 public interest compared countries successful containment mitigation strategies.

Methods: retrospective study, Google Trends used analyze volume internet searches within US relating COVID-19, focusing dates December 31, 2019 March 24, 2020. Volume internet searches related COVID-19 compared countries.

Results: Within US throughout January February 2020, limited search interest COVID-19.

March 9 March 12, rapid rise search interest. rise search interest positively correlated rise positive tests SARS-CoV-2 (6.3, 95% CI -2.9 9.7; P &lt;.001). Within US, took 52 days search interest rise substantially first positive case; countries successful outbreak control took less 15 days.

Conclusions: Containment mitigation strategies require public interest order successful. initial US level COVID-19 public interest limited, even fell time containment mitigation strategies put place. lack US public interest COVID-19 existed containment mitigation policies place. Based analysis, clear policy makers need develop novel methods communicating COVID-19 public health initiatives. sad moment New Jersey shit together better rest country *CCP anthem intensifies* No, poster child all. Go back old posts. counting NK - Japan slowest country East Asia react. covered cases tried keep Olympic Games charade going. also didn’t implement mask decree contacting tracing well Taiwan SK. example, let Japanese passengers Diamond Princess allowed take public transportation eat way home. please - don’t use Japan excuse take precautionary measures. model countries already done. actually pretty interesting theory, even interesting Catalase bought counter keep hair turning grey much.... Really large countries like US Brazil can’t really compared smaller countries like Sweden (or Belgium even UK) comes death per capita.

Then compare similar-sized countries, virtually deaths comparison.

Sweden far deaths Norway Denmark combined (at similar population combined). Netherlands far fewer deaths Sweden almost twice population.

I clue obsessed talking US, say can't compared US. comparing US. 

Sweden disaster.

NY luxury. great, happened understandable.

No state come close NY, AZ currently many cases , per capita, NY, despite experiencing surge much later, performed half number tests. surprised deaths overtakes NY (if method classifying deaths similar), would somewhat excusable AZ much older population.

And two predictions don’t necessarily conflict.

...but can't exclude people tested negative they're still susceptible catching virus. Essentially anybody tests negative never counted OP's statistic test positive, correct. bad news numbers necessarily accurate November 3rd.  True, think movies ever showed actually refusing wear it...

Unless books show that? ;-P similar mask shortage open browser, guess. numbers low? go school, lot children catch it. wait schools reopen. people find difficult breath wearing mask?

You're equating breathing difficulty oxygen levels. suggest little research blood oxygen levels respiratory system functions. added difficulty breathing due higher pressure drop diaphragm needs overcome, **not drop blood oxygen levels**. 

We millions medical professionals wearing masks everyday lives readily available pulse oximeters decades, one report wearing mask lowers blood oxygen levels. 

The doctor 100% correct given context. statement response ridiculous claim masks lower blood oxygen levels normal use.

And lies biggest problem pandemic: morons thing understand things better experts dedicated entire lives subject. Chick-fil-a way better job taking precautions live, isn’t even close. wear masks, moved many operations outdoors, even July heat, good job nationally transparent announcing public close due employee testing positive. Chick-fil-a fast food place would consider visiting pandemic. guys think Burger King Taco Bell aren’t list they’re better job fighting covid Chick-fil-A?

Oh, well, ask out-of-work people donate! idpol: identity politics.

cults typically use acronyms expression isolate members general society. think leaving cult.

As identity politics.

the conservatives successfully brainwashed working class men think option vote independent republican vote all. think democrats misandrist, black, hispanic party reality working class party. think boys take wealthy dad's companies choose hire cheapest people, visa minority workers females may also minority. working class men mistakenly think makes misandrist pro-black pro-hispanic world.

no, not, bunch rich inheritors hiring cheapest demographic/gender combination.

so females identify females identity politics.

when black people identify blacks identity politics.

so on.

but working class men specifically deciding political affiliation based purely gender race. identity politics again.

how supporting sons rich men choose hire working class men cost money going help cause?

Reason ask using mask since thought far enough neither person. track that? people go hospital know recover it, cases people months. Las Vegas mayor also earned spot (I asked city could placebo/control group...) ONE SASON FLORIDA Trump's message virus big deal, dangerous Republican politicians oppose Trump cult. Teachers Texas (and several states I’m mistaken) aren’t allowed strike - it’s illegal, lose teaching licenses. Completely makes sense rural areas stop taking outsized state federal funding, stop transferring sick people urban hospitals. I'd that. thinking maybe health experts underactive imaginations compared non-health experts. ""Worst nightmare""? imagine nightmare way worse. Something 100% fatality rate, aerosolized, wind-borne extreme long-range effects, waterborne, persistent surfaces, extremely infectious, death diarrhea, hemorrhaging suffocation... kill child? one anyway world would allow grandparent tested cancer? know older people vulnerable? saying hospital patient die don’t get paid life saving efforts put it? You’re naive that’s ok. 

I work medical billing. insurance companies get billed surviving family members get sent pocket EOBs. 

Covid deaths even Covid yield higher reimbursements. one loses insurance companies. Hospitals gain can’t blame them. didn’t intent people like alarmists gravitate towards sensational headlines fact it’s shady business move. People run hospitals aren’t doctors know. Simple solution... **mandate** masks limit indoor occupancy. Yup -- clear yes whether covid easy spread via hand-to-hand contact (is take-away position article). No, crazy would jeopardize life attending event without masks proper social distancing. 1.3 last week, first week week increase new filings since March 7 million 1 week...as things continuing open...and least 1 week missed unemployment checks days, possibly more. really bad lot people, going get much worse least 2020. 

Fucking astounding back March almost every economist epidemiologist agreed economic recovery without containing virus, went ahead terrible containment measures pump economy anyway. 

I legitimately understand, greed even explain it, coming depression bad looks horizon rich largely going losing wealth well. feel like i'm taking crazy pills. new cases continue surge across country, Birx said an interview Fox News Wednesday Trump administration asking states fewer cases boost ""pool"" testing, multiple samples tested one batch.

What shitty solution. guess idea federal government stepping help question. Americans bad health large percentage population useless insurance can't afford preventative medicine got results today: Negative! Considering many people already starving normal circumstances I'm afraid we're likely get used though number may order magnitude bigger equally incomprehensible. Kentucky Fried Lungs. It’s unnecessary virus raging parts US. won’t even faster. I've plenty similarly aged chicken sandwiches fast food restaurants much better. Also, actually picked shortly before. one one particular restaurant. People rave them, expected something better got. would prefer spicy mcchicken really. I'm guessing chick-fil-a lover? Republicans want better education, least masses. public education since least Reagan 1980. right thing.

Somewhere along line threw part out. ""do thing benefits uber-wealthy overlords most, screw everyone else."" 

Otherwise constantly trying cut food stamps, kill expanded medicaid program, cutting funding kinds public aid programs, keeping immigrant kids concrete cells. Remember weeks ago governor said hospitals need stop elective procedures response hospital executives unecessary plenty beds? Yes thankful don’t [universal health care, legendary wait times, plagued government (LOL) inefficiency 

BIG WIN FREE MARKET! Somebody fix it! think virus may never go away. need vaccine right? yiu/ suggesting virus mutate fast wont able get rid it? Basically logic behind "" never go away"" claim, anyone explain cause dont see ? must nightmaring hard, Black Death 3,000 times deadlier. virus killed nearly 1 every 10,000 people; *Y. pestis* killed nearly 3,5000. people control. Schools controlled large bodies Government funded throug too. Library's hand local tax paying services largely operated local people. 

Schools like giant child learning factories. Jam kids tiny room, get kids end year.

Library's could work everyone make safe environment kids learn endanger others fear betsy DeVos power library's. 

At least that's thought. Though wrong past, let know missed anything. can't nearly much work home due engineering type work machines get like pay sit around less work timing seems really dumb considering city big surge right now. grateful job said remote next 12 months minimum realize I'm lucky it. Florida drawn attention, virus surging Alabama, Louisiana Mississippi too.

As coronavirus rages across Southern United States, skyrocketing case counts Texas Florida drawn national attention, virus also surging three states along Gulf Coast: Alabama, Louisiana Mississippi. r/kidsarefuckingstupid. hope written will. feel like old turn phrase “it takes village raise child” apt.

We’ve become atomized alienated people around us can’t conceive communities like it’s payhetic (Reuters) - total number coronavirus cases reported United States passed 4 million Thursday, reflecting rapid acceleration infections country since first case recorded Jan. 21, Reuters tally took country 98 days reach 1 million cases, 16 days go 3 million 4 million, according tally. case total indicates least one 82 people United States average number new U.S. cases rising 2,600 every hour, highest rate world. vaccine needs injected regularly though? would think profit potential would become different...

If cynical, say vaccine that's precisely effective 3 months time would holy grail big pharma. Playing devil's advocate here.. hate guy. Think total piece shit. But, hot Florida people tend stay indoors. going jackasses, instead jackasses outdoors, indoors A/C.

Either way, really excuse numbers putting up. think amount death case count impact course mans plan.  Italy warned us New York. We've numerous opportunities get right failed every step way. They're literally drinking beer called Yeastwheat. I'll never understand people. part party affiliation think advocate universal mask mandating garbage human beings True.

but sure hear a LOT ""I symptoms still test negative"" care approach used long works get people wear face coverings. Maybe advised masks March then. tell they're drinking bread. case, it’s Middletown New Jersey. words, fat 328.5 Well virus going hit US hard matter leader was. top nation would able escape. However, almost guarantee response past administrations, Obama, Bush, Clinton, would far better far swift. 

I would bet administration starting let’s say FDR would handled virus way better cases deaths would substantially lower still rank highly world. made spit food 😂 ""Only""
Okay I'm gonna kill child. one all, nobody cares one child!  I'm trying skeptical critical things know. Looking data resources learn. #24...#25 Gov. DeathSentence Blame List. Exactly. 7 close shaves 21st century. Three flu epidemics, two SARS episodes outbreaks Zika Ebola. could spread like covid-19 got lucky. Coronavirus new human race, wounder differently time? can't even bothered put fucking mask. think gonna get treadmill?? lol Glad hear feel better &lt;3

I'm ok, hope you. could prevent death turds like fucking shuttled up, wore mask, that's labs use 60C, hour-long process deactivate virus processing. Professor Remi Charrel colleagues Aix-Marsellie University France found heating virus 60C hour still able replicate.

That's 140° Freedom Units heating virus 92C 15 minutes able totally kill it.

That's 197.6.

So, guess transmitted via food... whose way life things threaten. people get bad thing willing give normal life take steps make things better. They've already moved on. ones want change anything problem. directly threat them.

It's problem schools right now. Schools getting vast majority calls people wanting open area. E-learning option taken registration way higher rate phone calls would suggest. E-learning people already board change call complain.

Take even broader see people hold us back aspects country. country became great always pushing forward, always innovating always leading. people want hold past drag us mud slowing country down. Change greatness.  It’s 10 days+ NYC. It’s American problem, southern one, once. n= garbage.

Also, gotta start somewhere. starts chick FIL ends buying ethically sourced clothing. starts wihh clothing ends food think (anyone correct I'm wrong) studies found face shields actually really help since know virus airborne. floats face shield. thing shield protects direct spit-fire, squirting body fluids, etc., wear hospitals. know many people 'mediocre' jobs? understand frustrated friends, man...what asshole way think. umm 20k even remotely close 20 days respirator cost US ER.

On one day, available pickup. next day, went actually make purchase, pickup MUCH option, heh. timing right around ""second(ish?)"" shutdown... Natural selection they've paid epidemiologists then, what? 13x higher reality? 

Pffttt, rookie numbers racket. certainly get seeing people support evil world try make excuses confronted it.

Absolutely. Maybe peak take longer early spike among younger people, maybe it'll quicker certain stressed hospitals run staffing supply chain issues. Real life messy. Oh parents care? 

why TF send doofuses! funny part single one buffoons believe shit would even interesting worthwhile enough microchip... depends statistics use since people look 1 negative positivity rate Covid Tracking sites uses like Covidtracking, John Hopkins, others that's others look multiple negative positivity rate. that's I'm providing different ways everyone look get testing numbers duplicate negative subtract full positive new positive individuals. 15,094-10,249=4,845 subtract total 93,644-4,845=88,799 divide new cases 10,249/88,799=11.5%.

to provide duplicate negatives positivity rate. Since 93,644 included positive duplicates can't count subtract positive duplicates get 88,799. positivity rate 11.5%.

So better provide different positivity rates everyone like DoH 12.31% find County report mystery Negative since New Individual 2,821,074-2,775,092=45,982 State report says 78,550 according County report 72,923 match anywhere. that's state counts way calculations new individuals since positive new individuals 10,239 similar calculations tell 10,249. negative way off. That's put new metric find right positivity rate includes negative positivity rates actually make sense. Lol! Sheep! USA USA USA Plan it!!!! get $1000 fine wearing mask nose? someone explain doom gloom US specifically? certain states seem really bad, overall country's deaths per capita lower several European countries.

Seems control now. 1 million hair 2 weeks.... Wtf started following Dump bizarre. right, unions United States dying strong across world. Right work, “red” states crushing unions protected people oppression Carnegie, Vanderbilt, etc. Everyone forgets unions first place. Things going well, fading away, unions bust balls one. mention pension someone doesn’t one stare side eye like stealing them. haves vs nots. So, teachers particularly dime dozen, every position 100 applicants good teaching states, can’t walk someone take position less money. That’s terms contract violated. School boards would salivating this. look states like NC SC vs states unionized see difference salary. It’s amazing.  ya realistically prob 0. cramped elevator Yes... many us going back teaching weeks. pretty horrible. 

 speaking many pregnant women teachers, see mix. us start online virtual school included (until mid Oct minimum.) given permission teach home even though schools going back. given additional accommodations must force back classroom.

Might incredibly dumb, least choose topic. that, explained useful talk total deaths one's talking total deaths. Fox News training conservative base bark certain dog whistles though. One *any* dissent “Dear Leader” says.

Fox News literally intentionally mislabeled Republicans Democrats, Liberals, Socialists etc aiding competent adults Trump.

For base, don’t support Trump you’re conservative. mismanaged. Actively made worse. Actual data, sure. 2M everybody thought death rate 3.4%.

Now think abou 0.6%.

BUT DISPARAGE MAN DISABLED.

edit: lol, guess count government take personal responsibility. I’m anti-masker downplaying virus, point whether it’s mental fatigue understanding leadership structures don’t give fuck, I’ve kind accepted “it is”. rampant spread president clearly gives zero shits I’ve kind given accepted us going get point. Yes, thank remembering this. air flows according fluid dynamics yes go around corners, like water hole side bucket. implemented stricter lockdown, mask requirements, heavily pushed physical distancing protocols beginning March

I'm Midwest state locked March. I'm curious would consider effective lockdown. schools went online, restaurants, gatherings large groups, church, essential businesses allowed stay open. claim lockdown truthful. may claim lighter lockdown countries. would done made lockdowns successful? 

P.S. original plan flatten curve, argue successful. vast majority hospitals etc.) happening states locked down.

If lockdown (i.e. force businesses close), many people lose jobs? Again, virus (and fear, death, loss health, etc. come it) causing majority economic pain.

Now indefensible know it. laid off/furloughed 50 million employees! may claim fear could prevent economy bouncing back fast, definitely cause saying 1200 deaths day (and rising) highly contagious (and rapidly spreading) virus acceptable. 

100% agree. really talking number acceptable. point never brought up.

I pay-wall block TIMES. I'd interested analysis.

I'm glad agree elementary education. Even CDC Director claimed would send grandkids back school. Another news source interviewed five pediatricians said thing. hate r/Coronavirus listening experts one. Yes, used ""sterile field"". bandanas old cut shirts, cloth masks. Words matter recommendations. good point I'd like see data this. (The unscientific crowd sure huge, huge problem though.) proof get can’t get again? symptoms? area Sweden hotels became fully booked july much august soon travel said ok again. there’s definitely glomy couple months ago. could something testing turnaround times land relative day week (or day weeks ago). turnaround times 9 16 days, last two days would've mostly tests Saturday Sunday.

Edit 17 10 days* whatever right number Well you’re incredibly wrong lol. Life gives test first, teaches lesson. probably said Stay Home moms working moms. Look breakdown county Texas. Travis County better major city Texas, far. Compare number total positives number current cases, especially. Austin virus control. large city Texas even close. Now, Austinites make different? must add sometimes diet.. cheat.. hurts gut sometimes want feel normal. That's assuming everybody identified. Yes legend rice. Mathematical used term called ""Wheat chessboard problem"" ask why. legend find Yeah. think across US varies widely state even city county. I'm area relatively low cases. easier track, likely. bet big cities less diligent first 200-300

After one's letting kids dude, that. see happens ever “under control”? Unfortunately morgues fill fast run options. horrific scenario optic morgues setup mass causality events. used natural disasters before. Ooof, last thing disaster needs another disaster top it. Every country implemented single payer insurance also seen reduction capacity.

Government bean counters would cost-cut run lean can. Surges demand—the core issue Texas—would easily overwhelm “lean” capacity. Worse, reduced financial incentive (remember “lean”?), fewer people would sign healthcare workers. right thing virtual. Last spring, asked 4 hour work day cap requirements synchronous instruction, wrong thing. student got 6 hours work day- didn’t really learn anything. Granted, I’m either district, seems wrong teachers getting paid could work less students essentially getting nothing. Texas:(30 year old man dies admitting going Covid Party ""prove hoax"".) Alabama: Washington: believe facts science, media needing clicks publicly traded pharma companies stock price incentives C suite... think unlikely? think extremely likely. aerosol virus easily travel 10-12 feet, together 4-5 hours makes even likely. matter friends feel. Lots people asymptomatic carriers. OP engaged dangerous behavior, may gotten sick it. probably mostly large single owner ranches. mean people feed deer garbage walk local businesses. wouldn’t really glorify deer treated Nara. It’ll *extra* seasonal fall winter Plenty ""physicians"" coddling patients providing them. Holy crap horrifyingly accurate. Wear mask can, beyond - need psychologically protect yourself, too. right, moment, cavalry coming save us. protect communities best can. I'm Midwest state locked March.

Unfortunately, situation Great American Experiment appears failure. meaningful state did. Locking state like putting sunscreen stomach surprised face burnt. 

The country needed lock down, entirety, countries like Germany, UK, Canada, etc. did. still needs that. arguably late cultural standpoint -- people simply never agree point. fact, demonstrable least far numerous case studies demonstrate, would work. original plan flatten curve, argue successful. vast majority hospitals overwhelmed.

You keep saying *were* over. That's whole point started conversation -- stuff can't talked past tense. Hospitals Texas Florida overwhelmed *right now*. hospitals people like (or perhaps like you, making similar arguments) saying several months ago ""were overwhelmed curve flattened."" lockdown (i.e. force businesses close), many people lose jobs? Again, indefensible know it. laid off/furloughed 50 million employees! may claim fear could prevent economy bouncing back fast, definitely cause collapse.

I agree effects two (virus lockdown) inextricably linked -- point employees laid off/furloughed New York getting back work. people states locked down, barely locked half-assed job it, living crumbling economies end sight. 

Also, take look Sweden -- imposed almost lockdown measures whatsoever, yet economy took similarly devastating hit experienced US, Canada, UK, similar market economies total lockdown measures imposed. pay-wall block TIMES. I'd interested analysis.

Sorry hear that, impression coronavirus content free. That's disappointing. I'm glad agree elementary education. Even CDC Director claimed would send grandkids back school.

Certainly. think high school higher fine remain online. early childhood simply crucially formative. kids need interaction, diverse stimuli, etc. hope something sorted -- perhaps outdoor classrooms southern states weather permits? indeed bad issue rapidly vitriolically politicized. CDC studies seem show around 10x number cases know about. hospitalization rate could around 0.1%, resulting 700 children hospitalized using rest estimates. 

Another thing consider lot people going hanging getting anyway, Americans Americans.

I'm kinda glad locality starting virtual, wife position financially handle middle-school aged kid. feel really back people younger kids, multiple kids, can't work remote. 

All decisions suck right now.

edit: link article CDC:  indian?

EDIT: lol, caught indian troll. live here, complication greed. money, government would rather dead lose money. Brian Kemp read this... 😢 used work there, great quality affordable price.. hope turn around ok future defense OP median IQ average IQ large sample. normally distributed. Pretty sure people wear masks want to. I've wearing one whenever go anywhere busy since March. Remember guys, COVID kills dead people! ""the right"" thing though. . . . . . . . . . . . think body also needs free money Yes. question is. got sick fake virus. must lying. /s Fauci needs take month read nothing Gandhi.  literally anti-intellectualism. list someone's address reports get. proof.... one person wake 100 million cases. Rookie numbers. USA win spent time arguing minutia really even matter point. Unlike shoes normalized. Quite opposite. recent expectation. lol started pretending total number deaths important, pointing population matters, spending hours failing explain population actually matter lack answer yesterday get complete numbers, sort active cases. Scroll down, divide number active cases total number cases. half people ever county currently it, completely control. Houston, example, 2/3rds people ever it, currently it. Austin, 1/6th people ever it, currently it. means cases steep decline, everyone else still blowing up. think returning 2k deaths per day bit, tragically. Maybe even scraping past 3k. Never forget video basically made fun nyc bragged well handled virus. people really deny science Barking Yam That’s great guess, get without first place?   Disturbing. seen lots young people working local shops last six months concerned keeping socially distant state Queensland, Australia recorded cases community transmission. This, also wash hands eat mansion. Fuxking awful. Poor family. shit awful I'm crushed every time read story like others cannot obey social-distancing mask-wearing mandates. Fuck Nara city called. Went years ago vacation. deer really bow too. We’ve giving flu vaccines decades, hell vaccinate children soon they’re born. government wanted chips inside they’re already realize 

I'm actually *so* aware it, posted entire story \^

Woooosh didn’t know any. insane story...my office similar situation. “emergency teleworking” 5 weeks ago instructed come back office. 1 2 days week, 5 days week.

Telework option us, apply based 10 YEAR OLD POLICY. Even worse, AREN’T ALLOWED CITE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REASON APPLYING TELEWORK. reason? Oh yeah - it’s 10 year old policy doesn’t take consideration possibility global pandemic reason one would want telework. wanting get car road cleaner air acceptable justification (not downplaying importance clean air, get it).

So coworkers frantically trying submit apps, there’s like 5 forms fill out, supervisors write lengthy justifications plans behalf, it’s insanity.

I work local health department bosses would rather us in-person department “scrutiny” public wants “proof” we’re actually jobs. think public would prefer public health workers stay home stay healthy continue jobs. But, logic much leadership comprehend. Math checks everyone seems forget hvac USA USA USA keep seeing headlines honestly wonder many people actually believe Bill Gates wants chip people. I've seen pretty crazy ideas pretty crazy people shared Facebook place I've seen rumor sub. I'm sure people believe believe widespread Reddit would us believe. anarchocapitalism

funny anarchocapitalism bot's list political keywords thought states flu seasons winter, north. 'Backstreet Boys Tour' currently favorite. don’t appreciate they’ve brought people outside take orders instead talking drive-thru speaker. would add face face interaction? 

I know it’s busy lunch hours past, seems absolutely stupid now. love much. make sense. OP fails mention gets *daily* denominator looking *cumulative* total, even though people could many reasons tested six months. Cough cough Yes fauci said that, realize vaccines almost ready like Oxford one? Stay date.... around or...? remember learning story Chinese school. Looks like Indian origin though. busy consuming things don’t need caring others. superior ego proves time time again. one gonna tell us cannot freedom. use word anytime ego challenged. care “the self”. hidden American mantra “fuck fuck that”.  I’ve travel many countries times, felt embarrassed say I’m American. fact, I’ve lied said I’m Canadian. I’ve even told “you’re cool American” understand say Fluff mostly air. Fat solid. pretty much department heads make decisions fired sucking Trump really distinction don’t know. I’ve seen changes curve caused interventions limitations increase due testing. don’t know stabilizes. That's alarmingly high amount people see concern. Exponential growth, y'all. need nothing less great leader lead country world massive, ""special event"" focus. special event would world-wide universal mask effort. would well planned, masks would *everywhere*, abundance. Then, target date, would ""V-C19 day"", would ensue 6 weeks TOTAL masks wearing. Enforced. easy. Would save million lives more.  issue colleges facing regards tuition services still cost money maintain year. Rent, salary, upkeep, lab costs - college cuts back income 100 million get rid lot things. wont magically next year student enrollment goes back up.

I know sucks ways around, University's offer next 10 years made broken happens year. Except comment chain started mention total number deaths, per capita, continued total number, going far statement total numbers matter... yes, except fact I'm correct, guess I'm somehow wrong. Logic? U.S. people talking herd immunity beginning drowned responsible actual Doctors scientists. Nobody sense saying now. Sweden came close going way even less 10% population infected close 70% needed herd immunity.  name really gift keeps giving. Rona DeathSentance might replace favorite, Desant-ASS! Yet another reason never eat food Probably bad means probably 10x. I'm saying they're missing majority cases. That’s exactly someone use vaccine microchip someone would say. applebees welcome back bowls! Ive saying seems like every American state learn lesson hard way, like NY did. It’s gonna take while. least give credit. *is* misinformation. report person misinformation every day post removed every day. 

OP gets denominator looking difference total persons tested one day next. take account numerous reasons someone could tested six months. live Florida tested negative point past, decide need new test today, OP add test positive add numerator, denominator. 

It’s good idea want isolate newly suspected infections, impossible. OP trying use quantitative data make qualitative conclusion. 

Do think Florida spins data look better? Yes do. I’ve told before, started ignoring Florida positivity rate pay attention daily testing metric. count multiple negatives positives? Yes, else look really? There’s way get want get numbers. Fucking exactly. Stupidity making excuse guy. willing kill citizens whatever agenda wants continue push. walk around grocery store, it’s typically overweight old people wearing masks wearing properly purpose. I’m like want die? Still send out.

There's evidence masks parachutes. used think problem US government incompetent, anti-maskers least \*trusted\* leadership.

But Trump wore mask still refuse wear mask, I'm beginning think Trump / leadership excuse. never wanted wear mask ""freedom"" something, Trump's refusal wear one convenient alignment point time. Somehow countries managed deal much better US. origin put aside, deal situation arises responsibility. Live suffer, blaming others help. Yup, we're testing much higher percentage people now, March/April. Giroir 's 200K estimate probably right. Sure thing - here’s one: true story. know guy worked door factory Wisconsin. closed reopened. make terrible choice, go back work risk getting sick quit job lose benefits. chose wrong. carried disease home, wife died covid 19. 65 normal health. 

It's terrible choice company forcing you. would resent much someone me. know tell you, except outraged behalf. Good luck. rest world plenty stupid. amplified everywhere. opened parks beaches little early recognizing can’t keep people completely cooped activities relatively low risk

lol meanwhile Chicago beaches closed indoor dining going on... ugh.  new DC mandate includes outdoor activities. Basically wear mask times outside home, unless actively eating drinking children younger 3 exempt.  Yes, frustrating. I've working masks beginning. fight family thinking nuts. I'm figure make masks actually PPE adoption poor. Also, polarized issue. also get paid $174,000 salary, usually milk decades decide to. also get pension. is. also one wears masks around here, terrifying. Nope. fastest way end it, least individual countries pay people stay fuck home 4 weeks. anyone can't afford get 4 weeks worth food, military deliver MRE's. limit international travel essential services. US March 15th April 15th could looked like New Zealand. anyone says undoable, happens cases continue explode US. They'll another lockdown. wait gets point suffering proactive. Oh fuck. state ""she'll shut down""? May universe mercy souls. Or.... may sane people wear fucking masks gather groups. RemindMe! August 30 Exactly!!! many think kids die this. Kids largely protected virus- schools closed early this. Put back imagine death toll higher country stomach (maybe I’m wrong , people seem a-ok thousand Americans dying day). 

Not mention, deaths aren’t story. know cause lasting damage.....I’m less worried children dying kidney heart issues 10 yrs this. fake news? would say would piece good reporting rather scare tactic. failed contain spread would love send message future generations sayin - repeat mistakes. eat home!  Holy SHIT. That’s staggering. Toronto like 0.7 percent today. works combined thoughts... never specified thoughts, supposedly they’re important addition palm together thingy Nice even ""SkidRowTrash"" see faults country's methods Honestly, I'm south that. live violent city begins feel like necessity safety. wife nurse richardson area, staff members contracting already, theyre staff get reduced more. even managers help too. throw word around way easily   Seriously! live Vancouver Island maybe see 1 every 15 people wearing mask. many social distancing well anymore everywhere packed tourist. Tofino tourism even discouraging people bringing supplies encouraging people shop grocery stores boutiques. It’s like we’re living fantasy Canadians spread virus. sub fickle like that. take anything posted like supporting talking rather sharing things coronavirus Hm, yeah likely correct . processed 'residents [of hospital] following guidelines'

Residents community makes sense  I'm concerned large part population like dangerously ignorant hard themselves, family bystanders ignorance. Thats way worse fat person hurts themselves. said people also incredibly selfish cant see beyond idiocy blind hurting. Jesus fuck Ron DeathSentence Don’t forget Kim Reynolds Ugh. Can’t decide worse, American United, they’re always neck neck race bottom. moms cousin dad passed away Texas, mom surgery didn’t even know. didn’t even preexisting conditions, coughing fit died... also ppl drive smoke cigarettes set fireworks  Wouldn’t surprised different she’ll corporations pass potato seeing many times could sell seize person different companies price got high, actuaries run numbers came ideal number times sell, steal, markup, ad infimum feds help stopping right price.

Because death counts sourced CDC lag behind weeks months.

Please read ""technical notes"" section source posted, Previous analyses provisional data completeness 2015 suggested mortality data approximately 27% complete within 2 weeks, 54% complete within 4 weeks, least 75% complete within 8 weeks death occurred.

Isn’t fun? feel you. right here, sane people understand masks needed. insane crazies put bullet minimum wage worker's head people worry (and would worry job). Highest seven-day average since start June. Morbidly excited see high gets time.  Come on, numbers worst point time ever worst place Earth virus. New York schools 135k employees. yeah everyone's doomed lol. antivaxxer propaganda ...or ""standing up"" it, ""Won't scared"" it. literally care. knows one thing, that's get tasty tasty flesh make whatever means possible. cities would throw parties military would battles. let's talk mountain states state high amounts gun owners nutso private militia. stocks antiperonal anti armor weapons squirreled away waiting day man comes gunning them. would nightmare like Russia fighting Kurds. believe would see lot commanders standing lest forget military's job protect country democracy tell attacking would protecting it? Lowes employee, tell also instructed stop shoplifters, sooo..... Yes. Besides risk PMIS children amd know Australians

Australia therefore exist also heard mask inhale energy back in! Yeah went site saw couple versions test could see first page questions. page Chris Wallace said, sounds like anybody impaired pass ease.

I wish dude would take IQ test see moronic dude really is. Thumbnail pic shows TX contact tracer mask dangling one ear. Perhaps masks required seat cmon... least put good show camera. currently peak new case.

I think peak cases states shut down. lost ""yikes"". ok understand country either source: dude trust me.

The part holidays sick days true. check average salaries doctors engineers US compare german salaries.
The quality life living standard measures trillion different quantities. every poll different arguments based on. That's can't compare them. 

Your argumrnt crazy living costs applies everywhere planet - equally US Germany. 

Our politicians started advertising ""work worthwhile again"" last election, know people underpaid germany. 40% people can't afford living standard 1 job higher educated taxed bones. roughly 18-20% population University degree - 4 approximately 82 million germans taxed 42%+. that's amount people actually unhappy common fact (but also country needs most) - ones thinking likewise arguments mentioned before. people would earn 30-50% US ..with security measurements like insurances taken away would still ""to eat end day"". Keep mind taxes lower too. 
The german industry relies underpaid jobs competetive international competetive market (less money employees means profit industry - btw reason France competetive Germany even tho really strong industry). thought case numbers going up, deaths. swear fully believe thing would make father take seriously would type 1 diabetic, 1st born son dying shit. deaths, definitely treatment positive patients.  Florida older population. Covid much much deadly said demographic. Agreed. Thank goodness don’t Pence right now. AZ starting slowly go down, so, hey, there's that. Winner winner covid dinner. China, 10 yo asymptomatic girl infected 6 family members. body. choice. Oh right, used ""they"" refer two different groups sentence without specifying change subject.

Are suggesting aboriginals we're almost wiped decided risk catching disease worth taking fight systemic discrimination?

Or racist drivel all?

Perhaps communication strong point, 

or empathy, 

or critical thinking. we've entered triage game. link, fact checked copy pasting text sent me. Per snopes, attributed woman NC, confirms drafted know attributed Fauci. Back back WW champs, get nuked 20 sides NATO Also, doctors write ""COVID-19"" death certificate. usually primary cause death along contributing factors. Like, ""patient's heart failed provide enough oxygenated blood brain, causing brain death. exacerbated hole heart caused gunshot wound."" totalitarianism, yeah. wear muzzle 24/7. Tbh think US country actually keep making funny moves.  Nah, we're seeing things go, community likely say ""deserved it"" something happens you. Calling cherry picked bullpoopie one. story describes survey asked teachers comfortable returning asked ready return... freaking course ready return normal... conditions. hospitals laying people off, wouldn’t mark heart attacks COVID could get sweet government money? Except guns absolutely fucking nothing covid. paywall ☹
I wonder means 2and wave US going less sever expected? least much flu. though still lower immunity due colder weather lack sunlight (low vitamin D), schools reopen, social distancing reduced (for crazy reason people started accepting new reality 1k ppl die every day, that's nuts btw!). sure factors. expected flu season would make things much worse may case. great news true! Seriously though, long, hard fight stupids finally won. it. Expertise longer valued, knowledge questioned, ignorance championed, critical thinking nowhere found. 

It's depressing, terrifying, fascinating equal measure watch world's sole superpower implode real time. Assuming super spreader theory (that 80% people transmit infection others, select 20% infect literally new cases) incorrect. FWIW, agree you, however may many instances family members cohabitate getting infected (or developing antibodies) completely dismiss super spreader theory...  Sent bodies governors house! agree he’s fucking asshole. 

But stated far cry staring “he never put mask on”

THAT commented wanted know source. love hypocrisy reddit. time people discussing anti-vaxxers ask someone get flu shot there's always dumb excuse. still spread whether go work not, asymptomatic mild cases flu absolutely exist. always point people step help, allow people gain asylum.

If asylum open US citizens though, would probably first focus people highest risk. Given administration, LGBT people minorities would probably highest risk, even everyone suffering.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said nothing confidently amazing. 

The initial spike US concentrated NY. small part NY biggest risk factor city population population density. biggest factor Cuomo forcing covid patients nursing home caused massive spike cases deaths. However since got hump, built immunity it. Even basic immunity last long, still helps slow spread. 

Florida hand, fuck response. Many people never got virus all. massive protests caused NY level spike many states handles covid correctly.

Also. Counting cases probably worst way judge effects covid 99.6-96% survivability rate. Deaths far better indicator. 

Also, understand argue this. see graphs two events happened. Cuomo order nursing home accept patients mid-late March. Deaths spiked April. Floyd protests/riots started late May we've seen cases deaths rise protests grew larger across US. disputable.

I think women make biggest difference here. guys make masculinity care man tells wear mask, woman instantly get embarrassed. almost ridiculous displays ""masculinity"" act impress opposite gender.  First off, many companies make testing equipment aren’t even American, US government can’t much those. example, Roche german

But someone severe COPD probably fly either. How’s weather Moscow time year? sounded like 4 people max, least two already discussing clapping together. non-story No, there's reason that. Let break down.

Karens narcissists. Narcissists believe world exists serve them.

Masks used prevent person spreading virus. narcissists incapable acknowledging negative self-image. Contracting disease negative self-image. Karen think transmit disease thinks incapable catching it.

If try explain Karen makes sense, already lost her. explaining anything Karen implies already know information explaining.

My suggestion fewer lawyers scientists positions leadership. quite surprised many people actually wash hands now. use public bathrooms lot, maybe twelve times week (I live NZ) job requires visit lot different sites Auckland pre-COVID would see maybe two women week actually wash hands soap longer five seconds. dozens. vast, vast majority would duck hands tap literally less two seconds without soap rubbing - what's fucking point?! people disgusting!! Ugh gross af people would defend smugly sarcastically like, ""ummm *I* piss hands tap probably dirtier toilet anyway"".

But now, can't recall last time saw someone wash hands properly soap water. bloody time people took basic hygiene seriously. thank Medicare would help reduce deaths maybe need Cemetery All

Besides, based US public’s response far, feel somewhat confident saying receive vaccine soon will, society, unfortunately accept ~1% mortality rate willingly accept risk accept population sacrifice. People US return normal whether US govt wants not. isn’t good idea, happen 3-4 leading vaccine candidates fail.

Two quesitons:

* would solution point? Herd immunity seems like best bet me.

* certainly many population multiple risk factors. However, manageable. greater push get population healthier therefore less risk getting sick/dying? second time wife got 3 days did. clear epidemiologic reason sick second time concerning. saddest part bad now...it'lll get worse take 2 weeks get beetter. closed day 1,200 deaths yesterday.

June 11th last time 800. lower Medicaid Medicare costs, too! Legit saw someone Facebook say get many people infected/dead right society develop immunity soon possible

Edit: comment referenced upvoted post btw moved onto variation ""people die, is, live it""

I've anticipating rationale while, whole *""Well, lots people die flu, too.""* crew.   read title fast mentally skip word ""online"" changes meaning quite lot. forget fat. America ugly, fat, loud, annoying friend. downplaying virus helped spread? article clear.. course Houston, James Harden pleased. Woman interviewing baller though.

Well that's stupid comment thread, really proving point. source this? interesting that's case seem go logic. Dude calls using YouTube source science post YouTube link refute him. saving you. stupid realize stupid look everyone else. comment ""all lives matter"" clinical trial world, good look. 

the particular issue historically women excluded clinical trials men considered medically less complicated (what pregnancy menstrual hormone cycle). 

Look thalidomide tragedy. whole bunch birth defects nobody checked see anti-nausea medicine could affect fertility birth defects, pharma cheap include women clinical trials.

you care - every human earth gestated woman. half ""victims"" thalidomide tragedy men, lives permanently impacted nobody cared check something safe women (and doctors enthusiastically prescribed thalidomide morning sickness....)  totally get point.
I remember reading news Italy March/April articles high covid death count used random stock photos. Many people (including me) got confused. need either top quality reporting nothing all. Otherwise many people call fake news think okay ignore thread. Thankyou linking :) Yes course know that, think put /s cause ruins joke Duh, starting. misunderstanding medical reimbursement schemes? get compensated costs diagnosis treatment value determined typical cost disease. patients require treatments expensive, require less, average works reimbursement value.

Now, they're claiming hospitals falsely labelling deaths COVID-19-related falsifying diagnosis treatment records... that's quite big problem would surely noticed records reviewed audited, hospital would big pile doo-doo they're caught. Username check I’ve thinking flying home now, possibility deterred me. Depends, Asians US 50% less cases whites per capita, masked early took seriously. Many countries one point another fall cult personality, eternal shame personality 40% America fell love couldn’t get enough of.

If new Steve Jobs type, silver tongue, slick messaging, asking sacrifice grandma grandpa finish national stargate project secure America’s intergalactic dominance, yea, that’s pretty cool cult personality.

Instead it’s dumpy dopey failure human, asking sacrifice family fucking Karen Kevin date night Applebee’s hate fuck watching Hannity. great projects work racist wall giving yet another couple trillion top 0.001%

We shitty people.  think drop dead bodies doorsteps hospitals. hospitals care die.

Jesus, think... ""0 tests 0 data = 0 deaths! Magic!"" - excerpt Authoritarian Playbook Exactly. remember CNN article saying Trump holds ""dangerous"" rally amidst coronavirus spikes. Literally right showed sea protestors said ""protestors safely gather support BLM"" oooooooooo.......k...... dreaming. 0 cases. Yes 0 cases nearly since outbreak March. idiots went private parties around July 1st. today, 1000 people quarantined, least 85 people illness matter week. Yeah blame government makes sense. cities made mandatory mask still tons people going mask.

It's stupid people. Probably accurate. rural areas huge amount folks carry quiet it.  hope every county abide order.
We’ve one California places like Huntington Beach routinely flouted it. Nah they're selfish. I'm American work anti mask idiots everyday. think they're trend setters ""tough"" wearing mask. care anyone themselves. saying need wait Two Weeks?  Tell countries implemented lockdown seeing far lower deaths rate infections.

You Americans thick skulled. admitted country always best, something change things, much better off.

Instead, get guy relevant PhD telling science says - matches pretty well outcomes rest world - say ""gEt BeTtEr EduCaTiOn"".  Remember people, Republican money printer go brrr everyone average American. Oh stop it. Yep, amazed me. managed turn Trumpets everyone else, including Trump's former admin members, figured think again. maybe time Fox realized lose views viewers die out, go along it. interesting 4.2 million people Oregon. shut down, sheltered place mask mandate. thousands people protesting every single day. Currently CDC Oregon 10 20 thousand cases. 

Idaho 1.7 million people. shut down, sheltered place 2 months wide open now. mask mandate. protest today Boise, ID around 150 people. including BLM counter protestors. Currently CDC Idaho 10 20 thousand cases. 

Oregon double population, constant large protests amount cases redneck ass Idaho half pop nearly *zero* protests. 

What point again?

* short tempered candidate, someone establish conversation rule king, three powers must respected.
* Someone ability command, messiah complex authoritarian, one Lord
* candidate pro abortion ""christian values""

Bolsonaro would beginning list already, ran campaign saying negotiate anything, even said would, nobody would believe him. first point direct hit Bonoro. doubt here. 
With regards saying science precarious, well that's science operates, new model explanation comes along switch go what's appropriate, christians tend run fact every discussion, say know ""truth"" science sure anything, morals rules bronze age would make superior. think meant precarious ""incomplete"" ""doesn't know everything can't explain everything"", honestly gives meaning life anything, go figure out, that's see it. could see discourse coming mile away religious leader.

In fact FDA nearly decimated pipe tobacco premium cigar industry couple years back. think US amazing job reducing smoking rates public health campaigns awareness, things like public smoking bans work lot better banning flavored tobacco/nicotine products slapping warning labels everything. thats opinion extend whole pandemic, want clear I'm talking children covid vacuum. context I'm pretty sure overwhelming majority tiny number covid deaths children children pre-existing conditions Keeping children home specifically would massively reduce effective risk returning school.

If months sure could worth it, argument seems ""there short period reasonable put school hold"" agree with, even different opinions long is. think year education online young children would catastrophic developmental reasons absolutely worth it. expect still around year, precedent shutting COVID would imply willingness long periods time.

Lets get beds, PPE gear, ventilators, staff! tests!!! federal government literally billions dollars set aside situation. Lets get shit taken care of!!!!! Oh wait... money went billionaire's greedy politicians. Guess fucked.

Imagine... living country large portion population want hospitals get extra federal funding fucking global pandemic. Hey bro checking in. University Washington study coming along? still free healthcare. Honestly, world goes shit, Canada still good place ride out... US invades us, we're screwed.

People keep walking behind breathing me. Getting closer end objective Mr president. dying ... acute illness, yes. actually not, shows closely correlated increases decreases been, gives better picture. instance, saw weekly deaths increase week week end May/beginning June, actually lower percentage whole previous week, showed overall rate increasing deaths still slowing down. 

I first started watching saw Italy similar correlation trend weekly case death increases, gave good way look potential future numbers. next week probably see larger increase weekly deaths, dip following week (the W2W total dropped %), looking case numbers next week give good idea deaths week that. That's exactly conspiracy friend posted today better McConnell passes law protecting businesses COVID liabilities. Also feel lot people developed cognitive sense fully. good skeptical accepting basic facts see another level. reality children die it. big risk children spread school school staff, bring home infect loved ones.

Agreed, that's huge blunder. told China line stuck Reddit really likes armchair epidemiologist 20/20 hindsight nearly entire medical field thought way CDC time outliers would made calls.

I'm sure that's true. I'm trying say first-hand knowledge, I'm pretty sure South Korea possibly Asian countries mandatory mask orders point intent control spread source, personal protection.

Honestly, think virus education course good idea. much misinformation, even White House Press Briefings, it’s hard many get straight facts. You’ll get good ol’ “you believe everything media tells you.” Projection, default tactic. believe anything everything Fox News, Trump, right wing Facebook “news” pages tell them. *never* back statements up. cornered exposed they’ll gishgallop another “what about, about, about” argument. 

They’re bunch fucking pussies comes debating. They're party dysfunctional. party always lies deceives. party cooperate unless forced. party malicious threat lives think lies get reelected keep money train corruption flowing.

Our problem become problem country lets rot fester long fester. Right, don’t need lock (and won’t need lock corona vaccine) feel strongly it, lead example? Heyyyyy see well-informed critiques! Oh hmm, yes, findable small quantities locally around here, amazon stopped selling non-first responders. family member ordered Dealextreme (shipped China) arrived weeks. remember height shortage remember still hard get toilet paper time. idiots there.

I used work elder care, job traveling nursing homes patient residences dozens times week. comes seeing treat poor, sick, elderly society, I’ve pretty much seen all. 

I predicted we’d hundreds thousands deaths back April, heavily downvoted called name rhymes “boomer.” said America‘s toxic work culture lack sick leave would come back bite us, ignored. told people stock groceries secure PPE early, told ridiculous. One person said total deaths even worst case scenario would wouldn’t exceed 150,000 year, yet hit number July. don’t mean smug anyone’s face it, freaking knew. tore inside screaming warnings place experience, trying tell anyone would listen prepare protect around them, disregarded, laughed at, called names, ignored.

[Ad Interesting. Another thing point quoted 0.1% death rate flu based number estimates, typically done years flu season. actual number ""confirmed"" flu deaths (using criteria confirm COVID) deaths much lower, typically less 15,000 recent years. Here's nice First all, uncivil here. I'm sorry conversation gotten heated, something tone implies I'm trying dick. swear I'm not.

Second, I'm still certain I'm getting point across here.

I understand point. sarcastically implying conspiracy theorists think hospitals earn money listing deaths COVID-19. said along conspiracy theories crisis actors stuff like that. 

It's joke, get it. implying things stupid crazy people believe. honestly agree. said simple straightforward.

I understand that. also understand you, yourself, conspiracy theorist. things believe.

I get that. clear.

My point - conspiracy theorists right, say hospitals earn money listing death one thing, rather another thing. do. Insurance reimbursement depends, least partially, cause death. always has.

That mean hospitals *are* that, obviously. believe that. again, make sure there's confusion - think believe either. know don't. Neither I. Nobody thinks that. agree point.

It's one detail - billing thing - disagree on.

Am making sense, here? love small business owners pissed cause government helping stay open, instead pissed people asked wear mask. remember whole industry fucked American people lying breaking law causing economic crash paid penalties? Yeah healthcare too, housing. is, however, scant evidence coronaviruses endemic humans started life zoonotic pandemic viruses. 

[Human coronavirus usually nothing common cold now. evidence linking [1890 russian flu made jump cattle humans. 

Viral lifecycles fast, millions years evolution necessary virus adapt new host. We're already tracking evolution Sars-Cov-2, radar since january (although currently useful tracing spread patterns. see mutations generally, mutations seen Sars-cov-2 far harmless far treatment, spread, severity concerned). zoonotic virus mean completely unpredictable going kill us remain constant threat eternity. people think numbers fake every death matter cause marked COVID, believe many hoaxes. Wednesday's month:

7/1: 22 deaths Agreed. Yeah millions people US currently active cases spread from, doubt we're getting R0 low American people continue die. guys left rest world dust infection rate number deaths. NZ kicking covids ass. Aus 400 new cases think Victoria scrambling. Half America wants nothing scream forced wear masks. way win, rebrand ""War Illness!"" Shhh don’t speak Ill Marxist regime. people watching. high ratio asymptomatic carriers confirmed cases encouraging, suggests cluster discovered early. Ya, Covid America.

Yes, course, goes without saying. citizens US willing(or able) truly lock isolate, virus would less non-issue month; though, potentially spreading virus areas successfully containing poor idea. image ship full sick sailors comes mind though. things truly become catastrophic, would force ship stay harbor everyone died, even capacity means one less vote change tide fix things.

Yes, lower early July, getting higher. graph daily new cases, rising sharply month, suggests death rate going continue well. 6o% according scientists everywhere regards Covid 19. No. isn’t. Maddow covered couple times last couple weeks. Otherwise would never known bad there. consume lot news also brother lives northeast TX. would develop treatment vaccine going make transmission rate thus number serious/fatal rate low make potent customer pool really small? whole New England area learned well. link that? I'm curious numbers actually look like. ready trying argue stupid troll? Damn. Sad upvote. something I’ve wondering lately, notable findings studies looking this? listened NYT interview way back beginning (when COVID Wuhan) scientist saying certain viruses way mutating less lethal simply best interest order stay alive, can’t host dies. Stop going church? Worship privacy home? mutation called D614G - problem really hard tell much effect had. seems make virus transmissible, may may make less dangerous.

It's certainly true mortality rate Wuhan higher places, much hard say sure due change properties infectious agent many variables - outbreak Wuhan started basically nothing known virus treat it, tends result worse outcomes anyway. top this, much early part outbreak healthcare system stressed point either near collapse actually done so, also puts fatality rate up.

Finally, containment approach used Wuhan effectively ""assume everyone infected"" - unreasonable given situation, effect masking number entirely asymptomatic cases - someone infected asymptomatic point quarantine started could realistically run whole course disease without ever infecting anyone else due isolation rules - case ever detected infected. would also increase observed CFR effect decreasing number observed cases.

So yes, mutation, hard know much effect mortality. recent outbreak Beijing apparently caused virus D614G mutation, appears mortality similarly well contained outbreaks parts China caused original virus. mean civil anyway. There's real harm it, especially internet argument, matter anyway. well mean SC things slightly higher rate dying 30s

#merica course enforced. None shit gets enforced. would like add well.

At time didn’t know know sars cov-2. big difference cov1 cov2 degree asymtomic spread time infectious. Cov1 infectious around time symptomatic. Conversely cov2 infective symptom onset.

So going point: virus infective symptoms widespread cloth mask use helpful. fact harmful due people wearing masks correctly, constantly touching face, false sense security.

Obviously know cov2 therefore widespread cloth masks effective. Everyone needs assume virus. Cov1 would know symptoms.

As science changes recommendations.

I hope makes sense

Edit: add simply stating cloth masks ineffective control spread mistake. However see post giving full scientific reasoning confusing (I accept explanation isn’t clearest). Public health tricky field. need find way take complicated concepts make quick understandable general public.

Fauci admits original messaging mistake. However mean original message lie saw hsnd nut it, feels like someone else it. Denmark looking real nice right now.. I'm saying. 

Or Germany... Canada.. even Australia fucking radioactive mega spiders space

Pure cope Delusion 100 garunteed. assumption people made scenario. Like people getting shot Chicago learning hard way moved better run city? immigrated Canada work last October pandemic hit. Best timing ever. Mental health whole thing completely thrown toilet. It’s mind blowing. Full social isolation, financial ruin, constant feed doomsaying, nothing sit around consume information pandemic? It’s recipe complete disaster. feels like nobody cares. someone follows Lunar new year, still baffles line thought actually crosses people's mind point. Dollar tree super rural areas. They're cities suburbs literally never met single person HIV. *I still believe exists.*

I never met single person ebola. *I still believe exists.*

I never met someone (or admitted having) genital warts. *I still believe exists.*

I understand dumbass argument Covid deniers have, saying can't possibly exist personally know anyone it. fucking stupid.

Covid deniers fucking ignorant morons, full stop. top really gotten better fighting it. tried tested treatment plans now. starting get level infection south doesnt matter. can't get hospital get proper care said hospital theres staff it. Well, fucked. That's mortality rates go 0.5%-1% 2-5%. that's what's happen 70k tested positive today, 2500 dead end September, tomorrow another 2500, day that, shut entire nation again.

That's probably worst case scenario think we're really going limit health system. don’t understand. People saying months now. 10x number new news, feels like there’s new article posted nearly every week? fact finding high ratio asymptomatic carriers confirmed cases encouraging. suggests cluster discovered early.

For comparison, today Urumqi 18 new confirmed cases, 2 actually freshly discovered confirmed cases, 16 asymptomatic carriers previously discovered already medical isolation reclassified confirmed cases started showing symptoms. Anyone else covid-19 smelling distinctive smell everywhere? Also metallic taste mouth? Correct, don't. phone oximeter (discovered today thanks another redditor) mask affect oxygen levels all. Anyone saying wants kill people get away it, hates disturbing degree. guess they're stupid parrot unlikable people say. Nah, easier use executive mandate. They'll probably realize soon easier pass laws way. Every time somebody says comorbidity thing point like 40% Americans comorbidity. Nope. Herd immunity requires antibodies last longer three months. different data, please provide source. NJ slowly reopening, new cases remaining consistent levels. Difference states Australia actually handling well taking seriously. Also every state borders closed Victoria NSW strict protocols surrounding that. outbreak occurring another state Vic NSW extremely low. you? aren’t wrong. Also 80 year olds bad livers, bad hearts go dying test positive death bed. Yep, mark COVID Come on, suggested Americans able buy suitcase nukes blow relatively small cities them, I'm adding fucking /s that, know better. stopping. people idea talking idea drug business let alone business.

A vaccine like volume play. You’re going sell 300 million doses. make money volume. conspiracy guy isn’t fact? think many us reading OCD too, certainly am. posts little OCD seeming too. hopefully won’t making decisions debate won’t office longer. They're take smart along way. sad sorry. Imagine American, still thinking country best. Nah. scary maybe 100k 200k dying day. might affect me! Yes, 16 asymptomatic carriers turned confirmed case actually good news, indicates catching patients extremely early, presymptomatic stage. Note 18 new confirmed cases today, 16 conversions asymptomatic carriers. actually discovered two brand new confirmed cases yesterday 16 known already isolation. entire presidency one flaming dumpster another, one’s filled flaming medical waste. Well, Hospitals actually get [20% bonus person reality patients actually test positive COVID, like Hospitals lie it.

I think actually good idea TBH. Hospitals hardest hit areas get extra funding need attract talent resources.  Sad see many redditors victory laps right people dying.

What’s going happen tomorrow we’ll see 7-8 hundred dead, Friday 6-7 hundred weekend it’ll drop 2-3 hundred Things Europe, East Asia, Southeast Asia seem getting back track covid. reason cannot Olympics United States, Brazil, Russia, India. point infection spike manifesting death toll yet important. though 3000 day bad, confirming 60000+ thousand cases day right now. right back higher month. top states trying open schools flu season look forward to. article says 13% reported deaths might misclassified. trying figure best way report cases. assume want make sure total COVID cases reported, even person died causes.

That article also says this:

“Ultimately… suspect actually likely under-counting deaths over-counting them… may take year get final counts COVID-19 deaths.” ""Most really die covid, died covid."" Interesting see real fallout effects someone certain status that's hospitals operating, part, capacity. keep adding cases hospital beds, 7% going look like dream. What's current *untreated* case mortality estimate? 20% head old analysis. change name ClownReed. 1. It’s 0.00044%, hundred times larger number
2. Look closed cases. 7% everyone gets dies. 7% world 546,000,000 people. Half billion people would die virus spread everyone.
3. US one richest countries, money fight this. Think LEDCs Asia Africa don’t money so. I’m sure parody someone worried contracting coronavirus, unless know certain person served infected wasn’t wearing mask (which clear statement) chances infected almost zero percent. idea 50/50 barista infected comes from. 

I honestly think sub post something kinds scenarios likely create exposure aren’t, people posting stuff (no offense) intensely paranoid. trigger people read sub paranoid, possibly gives ammunition deniers characterizing people want strict protections paranoid. 

I’m really trying rude here, acting like posts like normal acceptable healthy. huge difference talking reasonable protections advocating caution, people’s mental health matters it’s important honest people way anxious. really sense panicking unless develop symptoms. know looking answer, stage worrying accomplished NOTHING. 

The mid may want consider adding pin link high risk versus low risk exposure scenarios, could mitigate people posting every time experienced something made anxious realistically going make sick. 

Stay safe everyone, includes managing anxiety. Texas here. hate Governor Abbott fucking much. constantly downplaying lying what’s going adamant closing anything down. pushed blame mayors won’t let close things down. released really bad mask mandate sorts loopholes police aren’t really anything it. worst part throughout people still think it’s hoax “no worse flu”. exhausting. 

r/coronavirustx info you’re wanting go disaster rabbit hole. ehhh im human contact mask ventilator

your choice GOD'S PLAN field hospitals. f going on? Unfortunately us, president supported significant portion population also shit-for-brains. similarly wars, perpetrators US themselves.. Ah thanks. Makes sense now. 

Something like 40% deaths assisted living facilities. least that’s numbers June said. killing really old people anyone. I'm honestly amazed Texans allowing shit continue, state full ""patriots"" ""don't mess us"" folk allowing governor get away murdering families without blinking eye...all name dollars. 

I see Florida's boomers passive never thought Texas. r/wooosh works two ways here. People even complained spent 52 million temp hospital never used. Cuomo really went super ham thing still is. God bless dude saved thousands. yet okay I'd say. Well, agree that. I've heard people saying efforts totally wasted, sensitive bad ineffectual line conflated he's saying, extreme could interpreted sense. Looking it, would rephrase comment agreement, providing side note. Apparently that’s real thing. Weird. could issue federal mandate masks; could March May, not. Vietnam war army routinely inflated numbers enemy combatants killed.  really need told keep watching? time, still need say haha spiked 2 weeks. 
2 weeks first group 
Another week 2nd group,(who came contact 1+ 6 days infection) 
Another week 3rd group (contact 7+ days) 
 
Repeat cycle successfully contract trace control outbreak. glad job suddenly decided actually “manufacturing” (we aren’t) somehow stay open preaching health important thing them. California orders shut us down. remindme! august 30 Eh, think fair worry children too.

Even mortality rate super low, still going bunch dead kids schools open. We're getting control yet. Makes sense 30k deaths per month since March pretty constant, marker people start taking shit seriously, 👀 Ohh passed away 91. still awful headline threw loop. sounds like led inspiring life. Lock em right? Get dirty marijuana users too. little research death rate. fond covid deaths today MUCH lower proportionately March April. Then, 20% number confirmed cases now, yet deaths mid April regularly peaked 2500. likely slight increase deaths due recent spike cases, won’t near many April. consider good news.  I'm certainly generalizing travels Europe I've proven time time Americans greedy heartless selfish bunch westerners. I'm ashamed country level compassion others low. 

This shit rotten core entire life learn history always been. go people many countrymen would stand served great country? Indiana.

No won't.  herd immunity fucking 10% infected. Please go away stop trying kill us. bad time here, noticed. Wait. American I’m running places escape now. *Crosses Canada list.* scary thing natural selection is, isn’t it? vast majority people catch (80% according WHO) able recover home special figure also much higher younger individuals non-smokers.) could support 45 left right, he'll drop like ball soon use him. ...Which exactly niece said! ""youtube star"", I'm ready leave earth now. get federal funding Covid related deaths. Oooh makes blood boil. Sorry that. 

On lighter side, would good plot point Covid episode Seinfeld. Love, Pluto asshat convinced mom bout wonders mms im constantly praying one forwards conspiracy crap shes believing stuff time goes on. would interesting see levels colds, flu stomach bugs change we're keep distancing increased washing/sanitising longer period.

But im Native American, tribes Casino pays already gotta support jackass wants take away guns?

Yeah fuck that. takes 20 minutes cops reach rezervation.

Because fuck supporting either parties point. know, best options. even panel. greeter telling people sorry vacancy. panel would better. Congrats, prediction correct? care even 10x people die long them.. technology difference argument actually held water, powerful military human history would trouble nearly two decades fighting mountain-dwelling tribals Afghanistan.

Plus undoubtedly huge rift military forces came revolution. Obviously bootlicking authoritarians many simply go along order gun fellow Americans. 4 years ago, giant orange elected, decided going move another country. 4 years, preparing, year validated decision move even more. Well one thank you. horrific. sorry. Yeah, it’s one thing ask health care workers deal health crises surge. Another say “oh 12 hours deal heckling protesting wearing masks conspiring get Trump ousted pumping numbers”... hello indeed phone way easier track, especially cos people turn location companies sell data, what's need microchip? Right. email included phone number it? herd immunity fucking 10% infected. Please go away stop trying kill us. bad time here, noticed. shorts pockets. Shorts without pockets blasphemy! Time half 12 though, right? dont way they're willing help parents, say school safe

They could tax fuck billionaires fund adequate social safety net, like already years ago.  Like winter? we’re stuck inside bc Corona? People color. There's excuse lie effectiveness masks even due pressure healthcare professionals. got email. seen doctor it, went drive testing place

barely spooke them, showed id jammed stick nostrils (both, hurt) Find whatever companies using clean shit. Someone got Covid work came deep clean desks keyboards shit. Wow, close shit quick endangering someone care about. kids parents, grandparents, babysitters, aunts, uncles, everyone come contact with. seriously know stat debunked? Lol someone who's done everything quarantining masks part, hate much. feels like we've done need things ease bit longer, see remember many people give fuck keep shit another six months probably. Vote Or, basing total bullshit. forget W? Iraq, Katrina? Trump small potatoes compared blood thirsty criminal. love wrote like disappointed parent.  goodness 16 new asymptomatic carriers became confirmed case, domestic! also Xinjiang?

Maybe find test population Urumqi.  Children ones risk. deaths age 18. teachers, parents, caregivers, janitorial staff... Based projections NY death rate 0.9%. lower range 1.6% based total infections. 0.56% higher range based total infections 0.56% percent. CDC estimates 0.65%. Right ball park. 0.8% NJ based higher range 1.1% average hardest hit states. Hahahahaha wtf talking about? right Remindme! 25 days sub attacks like wasps whenever anyone indicates they're fully board coronapocalypse hysteria. Can't expect think beyond first impression ""YOU'RE CHALLENGING BELIEFS? DARE YOU!"" made accurate testing person twice. go method dealing conflicting results article, good sign accounting false pos/neg numbers. utter bullshit. Nordic states Australia done jack shit, wear masks, fine. Mexico wears masks they're fucked. 99% deaths people fat, unhealthy, old. Also known people normally die anyway. sheer arrogance thinking stop force nature piece cloth fucking hilarious😂🤣😂🤣😂 problem! wait HHS ""take care"" hospitalization number! new cases due testing! Deaths flat,....oh wait they're anymore.......oh, Chiiiiina  Chiiiiinaa Chiiiiiiiiiinaaaaaaaa!!!!!!

The whitehouse basically performing vaudeville act credulous morons. patients heart attacks, strokes, falls, car accidents, gun shot wounds, severe infections, deliveries, etc.? part deaths? Facebook crazies saying hospitals receive check 35k someone dies COVID, why, say, car accident deaths falsely identified COVID. Redstate Damn wish could quit, Kiwi living Aus can't get nicotine liquids 0mg quite it. labs create viruses keep releasing public elections go way want. never get rid virus isolating. 

Extreme sarcasm thought this, could entirely wrong.

It seems early determine mutates slowly. I'm sure fast coronaviruses evolve compared say flu, nowhere widespread existed nearly long, current variants would probably still similar original genotype first moved bats humans. also really much selective pressure (e.g. vaccine, even simply widespread natural immunity) necessitates major divergences evolution would observable. feel like do, honestly i’d rather slightly harder time breathing able breath wrote short paper college different experiences going museum regular day “free day.”

This whole country feels like it’s “free day” lately... live Lebanon country. many dumb backwards people here. There's cycle crew:

Reopening lead cases

OK, cases testing

OK, positivity rate soaring young people they'll fine

OK, hospitalizations increasing know treat lead death

OK, deaths old people would died anyway say timeline 50+ days, prof. USA Numbahhh  Sometimes people disagree you, bro watched too. clear talking nonsense, usual. said order? Straw man. putting idiotic irresponsible ideas. problem medical training, though makes statement preventing gift it, oblivious ignorance. sounds right. odds causes reanimating cannibalism actually reduced social distancing time really, we've months clickbait strippers masks way, eat pie, there's decent chance die starvation. So, yeah, MIGHT messed pie, first 30,000 people tried slice MIGHT gotten lucky, chance dying starvation looking good either. Same. Yes, Colorado. Along kind 'trench' illness.

Nobody arguing hospitals don’t get paid **treating** Covid patients.
 
Hospitals **do not** get paid Covid *deaths*. TLDR: 3 new imported cases, 19 new domestic case, 7 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 24 new domestic asymptomatic carriers

Translation:

I’ll one better hundred articles posted two days ago Oxford released phase 1/2 results gave us expected timeline...

The article posted said takes “many months years”. Oxford started developing vaccine January. soonest saying phase 3 complete October. That’s ten months. seems right schedule vaccine developed unprecedented urgency. wonder hell fall winter gonna look like US. Travel likely half normally is, mass unemployment, flu back...feels bleak.

This one reason Texas ""such low death rate"" compared states countries. They're simply listing Covid-related. mark Cardiac Arrest carry on. TBF tobacco industry directly targeted teenagers vaping. think millennials weird slot tobacco products legally directly marketed us, still portrayed cool/sexy/rebel thing lot media growing up. wouldn’t know used oxygen walking around 😷 LoL 😂 feel hot mask face outdoors air conditioning it’s tolerable.

It’s job lots perks (good pay, travel exotic suburban extended stay hotels, occasional intoxicating rushes adrenaline something Important breaks fix it, fast), lend order routine lol. Except nothing breaking, leads lots boredom menial tasks

On one hand feels bullshit essential electronics go iPads phones shit. other, weren’t essential, x months wouldn’t able keep data centers, medical comms equipment working. stuff really long supply pipeline. wouldn’t problem sudden problem Unfortunately, that's like best-case scenario worst. applies many Dem run states - VA one dumb box rocks even doctor! state allowed ask person using exception. exactly problem service dog vs emotional support animal. 

I'm assuming problems reason new bills specifically stating 2 yr olds. I'd really like know outbreaks occurring. Speaking several people different areas state say mask use high, even though f'ing Kemp mandating it. Thanks sharing! saw 15% somewhere else. Maybe discussion here.

That 1point3acres site pretty thorough I'm gonna put understanding parse data properly. Maybe brigaded lives works federal land outside jurisdiction doesnt tend about... Thanks sharing! Like car crashes counted covid deaths get cash hospitals? Ugh. see onion, tomato, squash, carrot, apple, clementine, pork chop, chicken, etc... buying. Maybe need 2 onions instead 3? Possibilities endless.

NO WAY I'm leaving decision someone else. frequently make fast executive decisions ingredient missing package size vastly different expected. next impossible write down.

Nope. cant talk employers safety. Alot states at-will they'll fire I’m supposed feel sorry people choose pay employees bare minimum (not living wage btw) crying crocodile tears nobody wants work nothing opportunity get sick pandemic?

Oh well. Sounds like good business people probably re-evaluate track much profit minimum wage employee brings business. flu cause things. weren’t ever told it. rookie numbers. Gotta pump numbers Mmm completely reactionary alarmist. People shouting “Indiana fucked, nobody cares social distancing” since day one. eventually get hit outbreak? Probably. one lunatics screams every week finally right.

But like ... chill man Absolutely That's probably taking account people intransigent delay vaccination. get point effective vaccine generally available things get much better even population vaccinated whole. Even getting medical personnel essential employees done would big deal went mourning 2,977 deaths going 20 year long killing spree Middle East 1000 people/day death toll due bad leadership pretending hoax. Let sink second. like - riots protests police start nobody going ask fear policing again. need police, need authority place ever get everyone page. beyond stupid. Fuck China.. Don’t worry it’ll go away next Easter. Can't someone pee without permission! interesting similar right politicized climate change. realize Europe country? Government mandates factors play, though. First all, there's question reliably given population actually follows government's mandates - we've heard stories businesses refuse close citizens refuse wear masks. counties/states far pronounced. Populations different, respond differently rules. counties problem gyms, family gatherings going beaches etc. Every community going different. point remains - counties/states mandate closure obvious points virus spread benefit so. never late, even counties/states experiencing explosions cases still lock bring things control. Umm.....sorry can't States unless voted upon. wise thats illegal act governor. Governor Inslee (Washington State) tried type thing laughed him. even police took seriously. going Johns Hopkins chart? one says US 3.6% currently mortality. Though ravaging south morbid obesity high, may see go more. Here's Mississippi's latest case/death charts, running 7-day definitely spiking deaths followed suit yet. good, better Texas Florida. Cuomo may well go Bronx zoo implore Penguins learn play basketball.  think better chance Penguins.  Fucking finally said, compliancy issue. bars allowed operate outside, bars San Diego IME. saying Newsom put order shut down, every place actually listening order. gyms SD refusing “cave” even willing move stuff outside. millions kids go home grandparents everyday school. Indiana kinda blows. grew count lucky escaped. sensible ones... Upvoted everything except sorry butt hurt pointed topic discussion.

I listed quotes links listed jack squat.

I said 

  oxford vaccine ever comes market offered US put time effort seeing exact time took phase testing 

 kind blind, uninformed skepticism (when real, verifiable reasons skeptical) breeds anti-vaxxers 

So taking granted something safe research bad eh? Sure man whatever say. You’re Ill-informed trying cover tracks bad arguments. 

When linked quoted entire time. 

Well least one us is. top skill sets bed pan changing adult diaper fitting.  That’s tiny violin. plenty places factors except one.. I’ll let decide one factor think great see famous people setting good example. Even ""photo op"". engages people ""do right thing"", I'm it.  Middle management literally killed her. fucking idiots. Tomacco! Wait, think get symptomatic treatment results come back??? That’s works irl.  saw lmao. “First cousins” what????? something listed next CarFax.... 
Cause...
I want pay full price car that's trauma! made us wear seatbelts ended working alright time. states need this. mean couple weeks I’ve always non smoker. Anxiety still here, lol. Drugs hell drug though. 

As exercise... know. suck. can’t even force 30 minute sets week. Even yoga. covid gym 10+hrs week. body sagging apart reaction see mirror even worse before, I’m going backwards look like crap. Surgons also things average people can't. trained professional something mean everyone else should. saw dentist fix teeth using mirror drill avoid medical costs. everyone too? Anti-maskers bad anti-vacciners/anti-treatmenters, matter path curbing/curing coronavirus, humanity unwilling adapt change. Thus, SOL. Vaping even worse it’s proven lower body’s ability fight pathogens lungs. 

For reason, though, nicotine users underrepresented Covid cases. use tobacco-less snuss pouches fingers crossed hoping it’s cure /s yep used report button like do. get Fuck... things look dangerous virus.  No, says: researchers found, ""Unvaccinated children tended white, mother married college degree, [and] live household annual income exceeding 75,000 dollars.""

You’re right, anti-vaxxers already vaccinated; they're kids getting benefits.

That’s fair point. China promises share vaccine globally. US's claim true, tell me, kind thief that? 

Also, China leading vaccine research currently, need steal?

Lastly, US claims never provides actual evidence. Report ass. going get people killed.  can’t wait teachers call police kindergarteners wearing masks right lol what's happening? We're /losing/ New York. That's unacceptable. must win. ⸮ people it’s not. 

Guys don’t listen dude, he’s speaking completely ass. replied someone said Ebola sars-cov-2 *first cousins* tried Ebola meds early on...lol. 

They’re first cousins even close.

CoVID spreads extraordinarily quickly. 
Ebola kills extraordinarily large amounts get it. 40-50% death rate. They’re completely different types viruses, causing somewhat similar symptoms. Ebola however attacks immune system kill making bleed inside first. CoVID causes serious oxygen issues blood shutting organs.

That’s like saying it’s similar Rheumatoid arthritis malaria used RA malaria drugs beginning try treat this. Add politicians, athletes wealthy list well. agree, feel like common folk farther priority list however; also believe anything everything get done fast possible order get back semblance normalcy economic growth. J.Pedant, ""Common Fucking Sense"", Journal Logic, vol.1, p.1 Honestly I'll surprised football happens all. NFL teams massive (with equally huge support staff) seems impossible safely. sport lends well bubble either, see path forward.

NFL pro sport long lead time come plan.... best came with, I'm optimistic. Hell, climate change everything else going on, many us might make 80 even without smoking.  CDC explicitly says site is. COVID-19 deaths input hand essentially. normal death record filed electronically, COVID-19 record additional processing time. There’s lag 7-14 days many places like Texas far beyond lag. Half life Alyx amazing bro. Makes hl3 tbh Ya, issue people many times work time it. Bosses set priorities, hopefully communicate directions. one license going anything stupid self destructive guy Facebook said obviously doctor wrong Thanks thanks unnecessary. We're people going work scared, trying jobs. We're different teachers, doctors, grocery workers, child care, etc. People realize we're together, trying make positive change. anything, kind, respectful neighbors. Take care one another.  Central Indiana nice spots:) sadly probably going get much higher Imagine useless quitting job means automatically they're going collect unemployment. people actual careers actual skills may standing offers go work competitor, may well suited contractor, etc etc.  I'm Dallas area too, alarming see numbers rise day. know, right? report events, like watching broadcast two completely different countries, lol. correct, caps $450 week. Yeah guy legit crazy opinion probably high school college super athletes amazing VO2 max. :P

But seriously, many health care professionals masked day someone living Utah really pisses off. county mandated masks time I’m forced go see crowded spaces full non-mask-wearers. good response initially feels like state gave up. flu deadly enough wipe months. Sheesh. People getting tests backlog. Nobody wants quarantine almost 2 weeks waiting result. It’s right, it’s what’s happening. vIrUS hOAx, mAsKS woRk. can't believe still people say Lots us staying home workforce entirely since American people decided engage international shit show world. Working nurse worth point. I’m opposite started vaping decent amount quarantine got bored Let's real here, we've seen happened PPEs.

They'll first buy massive amount China, give mention media came from, take credit successful Operation Warp speed, then, anti-vax crowd ensures vaccine fails, blame China's vaccine defective (and ignore worked everywhere else world)

And like PPEs, they'll show absolutely zero gratitude China saving lives millions Americans. Yeah doesn’t suck people communicate openly honestly?

/s Trump try buy German company working vaccine make exclusive Americans? 

China said make vaccine, would make available world

American thinking profits
China thinking good mankind Bars shut down. Idk part California you’re Bay Area every bar uses “I serve food” excuse they’re open. spoken health department loophole serving food allowed. bars know closed California regardless Newsom said. literally work bar right lol. work strippers. stripper asked put mask, I'd it.  Wearing mask public easiest thing limit spread, I’m starting call people now, point minority people right rest history look anti-maskers selfish assholes lockdowns kill many rona ever would've? authors MULTIPLE papers retracted past Boris Bolsonaro giggle say “Its turn” Wait, what? read rapid deterioration infected reality. perhaps partial cause. cytokine storm hits..time short.

A person may okay..just little short breath hypoxic..low oxygen... mild symptoms oxygen levels dropping. Next day night gone.

Have read least 6 7 stories like loved ones died. seen doctor day. bishop Dude, I'd go ballistic setup. That's 3.25 people per bedroom (I assume probably converted living rooms 2-3 bedrooms).  Herd mentality. Time animal genocide guess? That's pretty much feel. I'm comfortable cash next weeks Congress argues next. I'm confident I'll back market mid August. shitshow 130 deaths one day. definitely lag state. sounds like next Bergamo mask inhibits breathing extent, sick public pandemic. 


*Cystic fibrosis* patients even wearing masks without issue. Trump setting example? worn one months pride. I'm glad finally decided wear least once, one every time see convince everyone else ""our favorite president"" everyone else. Honestly, valid question cases popped recently China Yeah, lol local sheriff released statement saying basically saying wouldn’t enforcing go away ’real’ calls important. got reported state seemingly joke even that...

His go statement leave place aren’t comfortable aren’t following laws... isn’t terrible advice also is. every business around town fails take precautions seems outbreak occurring community would likely putting public health unnecessary risk know.. plan? Depopulation? infuriating, agree. They've already killed one person close me. I've never felt anger toward side. even ""other side"" comes this? person said, ""Hey, let's allign spreading virus. makes sense politically."" We're screwed. bad one N95 respirator. least mask wearing uncomfortable enough keep people home. mean person actually locked fuckin place opposed southern govnas? believe lightheadedness COVID patients caused shortness breath, lightheadedness caused COVID you’d know Especially since everyone already carrying tracking device everywhere go including shitter. #*Greg Abbot* Yes Lol early say Bro, welcome club Follow money..... classy dames need face shields clientele pop corks Polio still (quite) eradicated. Total eradication rare. Without reading study I'd guess antibody testing gauge many them. Easy explain, Söder likes police control. man dangerous. Please forget past (crosses, PAG etc.). traveling internationally month (yes, ideal times this, know...but I’m going see long distance wife needs right get USA). 

I traveling least 16 hours terms flying time. ensure make chances exposure coronavirus nearly zero? planning acquiring N95 masks wearing face shield top, entire duration flight. enough? much impractical long flight time? Yes, understand. compared median mean comparison US data headline wrong. Use US mean death want compare US trends. thing I’m protests it’s part problem people gather masses. People say doesn’t spread absolutely does. people protesting BLM ones bitching idiots protesting masks saying spreading it. LEGEND STILL DISAPPEARING DAY numbers starting fall Pakistan. Benefits young population guess. simplification bit leap think. I’m pretty sure aren’t two distinct death rates uniformly applied based whether show symptoms not. know? It’s novel virus. lie detector determined lie  take long go 200 deaths per day 2000. containment hospital collapse, leap all.

Now add 5 states plus 44. 10,000 deaths per day unreasonable. That's 200,000 baked in. could much worse. 2.4 Vietnam’s right now. 6 months. Almost vaccines tested going require booster shots, immunity pretty short lived, looks like. ones boost T-cells chance lasting longer.

I hope people freak realize shot, shot every 2-3 months. u/thisisbillgates hard hear kid though. misinformation everywhere  plus side, one see car lol. Somebody say it. Interspersed “Playing Boys” Kenny Loggins. It’s simple a) 2-4 week lag time infection death b) lag reporting deaths state health departments. like anything worry about, healing factor likely. organization like measure productivity amount time one seat. Deliverables meant nothing. Quality work meant nothing. 

19th century thinking Boomer “leadership”. Michigan... I'm actually disturbed comments see Facebook. alarming many think masks ulterior motive Governor whatever boogeyman they've constructed minds. fantastic! sending commissioners, vote tomorrow. wasn’t lab confirmed concrete data? account false negatives positives also? lean conservative. least that’s people tell me. However fathom US Specifically republicans dropped ball bad. group people claim patriotic. You’d thinking possibly saving American life would make us republican leaning people gung-ho wearing mask. Lol didn’t talk sh&amp;t conservative chat? true. unit work saves Medicare Trust Fund millions dollars year. I’m UK, despair... 

Why? UK cases fairly low (10x peak level). Death levels 15X peak level (and probably way level noise) Good news Walmart went first masks.Then fell like dominoes. Nobody going enforce long term. executive choose mandates policies money.

Near sighted try get both. believe that's Walmart doing. known first place people want wear shop there. 🤷‍♂️ Plus Lowe's supply Sawzalls wield non markers get uppity. dumb live. Please god, let reproduce! Hey, remember Trump called Obama design 11 cases 2 deaths Ebola?  I've read often viruses mutate become infectious, less deadly. makes sense evolutionary standpoint. virus kills host quickly going one lasts long. I've exposes multiple times. partner diagnosed positive. I've tested three times, negative. would volunteer study heartbeat. possible gotten less deadly, although I've heard really believed case. mutations small minor. 

The big two reasons NYC high ifr 1) hospitals massively overwhelmed 2) early on, lack knowledge treat it. since changed strategies treat significantly. think largely president significantly acknowledged deaths. He's whole mourner-in-chief roll. ಠ‿ಠ Honestly, really believe billionaire dump?   Truly speaking, God bless America ! science , pray...

But, know going happen ready round 2 time, still fly anywhere want USA like isolated country. 3540 confirmed Covid.

Not attitude. Anybody could tell barreling head first disaster three weeks ago. insane let happen AGAIN. Except literally country headed towards disaster yet still debate whether open schools?!?! serious trouble. Exactly this. quick reminder Holland hometown Erik Prince &amp; DeVos family long history area. one religiously conservative areas state, demographics shifting. Garbage.  now. moderately low mortality, long lasting pandemic kryptonite way brains wired.

Fear, concern, etc mental drives defensive responses. Fear drives focus attention, it’s keeps us vigilant.

And human beings fear response like cocaine. It’s adrenaline cortisol. Short acting, high impact transmitters enable us incredible things protect around us... little while.

After days exhaust adrenaline reserves. weeks, cortisol levels start trend back towards baseline. (For neurotypical persons). months? literally impaired ability give fuck. It’s smokers go basement there’s thunderstorm. We’re *really really bad* handling long term, slow-burn risks. Even they’re massive.

You things know (if aren’t shitty person) people also driven emotion. We’ve got one hand tied behind back point societal level shows. Hell, I’m paranoid fuck even though TheThing, I’ve caught slipping. washing hands many times packaging food, disinfecting thoroughly should. know needs done, brain growing tired.

That’s need strong leadership science based policy, keep things stasis individuals exhaust reserves. VT. haven’t death month believe. Dunno big brain thoughts pulled bootstraps! vanish summer.  Many school districts remote option, obvious choice live grandparents. Mary blue dress. Pollution sometimes, cities, also illness. pollution nobody would wear small towns, still do.

If sick potentially contagious, wear mask protect everyone else train, shops workplace. That's see masks Japan, Korea, Hong Kong etc flu season... people sick. polite.

And course like anywhere germophobes risk infection paranoid ill, wear protect themselves. Yep Orangetheory 4x week I’ve gained 10 lbs started walking again. Nine times... nineeeee timessss Ahh healthcare workers get shit unemployed continue unemployed. patients unemployment he’s making $1400 bi weekly. go July August, 90 degrees considered cool outside. sheltering place year we'd going shopping eating something indoors weekends. worst still come... wait people realize many people health permenantly affected recovering even mild symptoms... heart problems i've never stuck constant headaches, fatigue sore throat since almost 2 months i'm mid 30s pre-existing conditions... Hospitals financial incentive test patients COVID, even aren’t severely symptomatic COVID wasn’t primary reason admitted.

This increases number cases number patients identified COVID positive. 

Again, bad thing - it’s conspiracy theory either, OP implied was. 

The hospitals’ incentive even greater since dire straits due slowdown elective procedures. confirm. Co worker cystic fibrosis he’s wearing mask whole pandemic. Shut up, Senator Graham! I've met braindead nurses... conspiracy nutjobs contradict education, time. need though. almost cases. Meanwhile possibly people infected people.

Give money corporations selflessly use protect employee jobs wages. give directly employees waste lobster boom boxes. read? said: hospitals get money list death Covid 

Which true. death Covid medicare reimbursement much less. 


This steel-man over-reported Covid death conspiracy theory: 


Hospitals trying make every patient dies Covid death, get reimbursement, even Covid cause death. Upvoting awareness people actually exist. That's great, beside point. said virus usually gets weaker spreads widely. Yeah don’t think explained well don’t think benefits aren’t fair. don’t think people sitting home better normally (or even equal middle class sense) many poor middle class people badly (or average) ever risking life every day. wish distributed fairer way ever wanted know would happen middle aged dudes sit around bars reading local crime blotter talking would happen ""if ran zoo"" actually run government look around. isn’t saying efforts useless. He’s saying regressed must cover ground again. in, two additional months shit re-open safely.  trading Russia too, Trump way. Field hospitals. need them. Better nothing level Ive seen. Carbon effect viral spread, basically multilayer cloth mask.  That's one concerns KN95s. live Georgia. data looks like. See scary upward curve beginning? Remember alarming news stories ""exponential growth""? Well, happen. last months, we've maintained continuous linear progression. Now, look steady rise right side graph. done nothing, would continued exponential growth, would spent last months Italy-style horror, overrun hospitals, mass graves, etc. embarrassingly bad situation. failing acknowledge potentially far worse situation wrong.

I see trying overstating point, think helpful. Hey, also go RenownRectum bud, upstanding account lol. Ha yeah, Hawaii? 

I received book Donnie written Mary Trump, think interesting read.

I'm using 7 day rolling average irons weekly variation. ~68000 right now. 7-day rolling average deaths 1800 days would much higher. It’s like normal Americans either. alien, certainly top. Remember ""Im war time president"" speech? tried, albeit briefly.

Obviously imperfect due people's changed behavior pandemic (less driving, possibly depression etc.) think highlighting would least give people clearer picture impacts this, might shut people saying ""where deaths?"". 3 week reminder... Yeah flew American, woman walked onto plane mask flight attendant greeted happily made zero comment it.

[Simple, areas populous, infection spreads quickly naturally.

But also took virus much seriously, that's Republican areas spiking hard, well overall spike happened areas. would definitely acquire N95 trip, maybe bring couple backup masks case. really can't find might try KN95 (a Chinese standard) KF94 (a Korean standard) pretty good, though quite N95. would eat drink minimally quick possible. flight, wash clothes, bring hotel apartment except plastic bag, immediately shower, use listerine.

""So what?"" -JB story behind surgeon comment? 2 delays back back flights. 2nd one 8 hours offered Subway sandwiches. strict masks would use right surprised Lebanon county. Worked APR swore town gem pennsylvania Why? We've tried nothing we're ideas! Let's forget social aspect this. work, government entity, mandated masks two weeks ago -- three people got sick one week. I've made fun getting haircut since February, wearing mask since March, generally going anywhere since March. Rumors one people got sick one got angry force wear mask office building work asthma. nearly died asthma multiple times. Americans sense duty towards fellow citizens. believe responsibility anything. deniers believe hospitals inflating numbers would get paid Greetings Germany, we've strict gun control actually means lot. quite rare hear gun-related deaths, maybe times year. Germany focuses important things people like accessible, affordable Healthcare &amp; education everyone. perfect either, light-years ahead US. Stay safe, guys.... I’ve zero faith profit healthcare system.

That’s subject though. subject conspiracy theory states “hospitals over-report deaths get paid deaths”.

That clearly, obviously, wrong. various articles posted back up. zero evidence anywhere hospital paid deaths.

Plain simple, there’s conspiracy theory, there’s zero data back up, people like keep linking information isn’t relevant discussion. Bigly police going fact? heard one first time day. idea it’s coming from. Gid damned dinosaur. get government wants reopen airports.. really time reopen them.. tried reading comments donny's cultists started get chest palpitations stupidity. absolutely horrifying heartbreaking see what's happening valley right now. news facebook feed. despite that, still family friends taking seriously.

People getting turned away hospitals Starr county capacity people still taking seriously.

We've reached tipping point we're going see increased death rate capacity accept treat new cases coming in. good thing least area (California ) almost everyone wearing masks.   six applicants last month ask would hire ui runs many fill app leave bad numbers etc pandemic causing lot problems everyone jerk. know fomite transfer major driver transmission contact brief, distance partially outside.

Hundreds thousands people still flying around, think fine since seem precauious enough  Buckle up, ain't seen nothing yet. Yea. Thousands upon thousands preventable deaths totally cool could also seeing deaths indirectly caused Covid. people going doctor hospital things normally would. 

Anecdotal, finally ""bit bullet"" yearly physical two weeks ago patient office. think ever happened before, even ass crack dawn. Logic,, where... Lol explanations downvotes..

I wear mask, downplay seriousness virus, wholeheartedly believed hospitals would receive funding spots virus prevalent. also believed non-coronavirus deaths twisted written COVID deaths fact. honestly really would like proven wrong, I’m sure I’m going downvoted hell want see side narrative I’ve beaten head since day one. never wanted believe hospitals made sense. articles use refute that?

When protests really popping off?

I know popular question but, possible link there? 

I'm sheerly curious trying push type narrative. Swearsies.

Edit: I'm looking research opinions. I'm lazy ass, I'm asking help source info. appreciate apologise brash. murdering citizens sheer incompetence ignorance negative negative.

We absolutely logistics. Every year order 165 million doses flu vaccine given US. stick people second time COVID, barely work. 

We'd need scale factor 1.5x-2x ... hardly insurmountable. read article? says (Republican) governor likely making recommendations cannot traced back CDC all. Yea there’s probably lots people sick covid got skiing accident totally unrelated organ failure assassinated getting bed rest. Like Jurassic Park... Windmills must tilted at, lest loose hope. KN95's mostly fake (don't meet standards) though. certainly fear life, yes plan emigrating skilled worker visa. Call gullible sucker I'm sure see problem there. count positive tests previously tested positive. makes sense that's still positive case can't get Covid currently Covid. test multiple negative cases would make sense. get tested today test negative, mean definitely covid tomorrow.

Basically process 1,000 tests today, expect 1,000 results. one someone tested positive day, positive new positive case; confirmation still virus. Ok, didn’t say teachers 1/4. made really big, really false claim vaccines. vaccine anyone talking ready soon Oxford’s 

No every day least one posts new promising new vaccines ""in pipeline"" ready soon. said applied posts sub. 

Furthermore link listed said takes years develop vaccine. 

Not produce it, market it, develop it. mass producing vaccine less 7 months 25% time takes develop one cutting short production time.  Please stop spreading blatantly false information. 

Himm linked internationally respected foundation widely regarded one best world. links you?  wanna hear something that’ll keep night?

Essentially, several good reasons worth 4 billion dollars. give people 50% discount risk catching it, generous you. Sorry hear this. curiosity, kind work that? Look beautiful epidemiologic curve.
FYI Gov Inslee mandated masks Yakima addition corrections made (or bacteria vs virus, animal vectors, etc) issue virus already experienced many genetic mutations evidence reinfections. could best comparison really flu, new vaccinations would need taken every year combat it. absolutely true. person cannot wear mask likely high risk Covid. people keep trying go business, hey actively using reasonable accommodations businesses set up, curb side pick up, delivery, website ordering (etc). people going places without mask claim discriminated against. Next step sue. Win, lose, draw, money going lawyers. might able provide anecdotal evidence, actually look stuff up. ~207,060 teachers New York State, ~306,000 California, totalling 513,060. ~3.6 million teachers United States. means ~14.25% teachers United States located either California New York State. *Generously* assuming, said, every single teacher New York California ""very leftist"", 1/4 figure still bullshit. you’re outside prolonged periods cold weather, many people wear kind covering nose mouth replaced business major medical background medical position

I mean, exactly would expect try run country business. MBAs actually great finance divisions tend unable deliver quality divisions. Uhh misunderstanding WHO. can't 100% eliminated now, brought manageable level. eliminated January either. Good idea. low-wage workers could wear mask day years get beat shot public asking comply. let's say they'll get raises year, too, this.

I want work anymore. mean, true, think hospitals callous enough fake data get paid.

 ""the best tobacco! told best green tobacco world."" sad, sad. 99.6% deaths adults... numbers numbers. 0.4% fatalities children still means someone's child dead this.

EBT translates $2/meal generous benefit. argue “well eat eggs peanut butter sandwich beans/rice every day” way you’re getting proper nutrition that. That's totally fair criticism. America longest lasting constitutional democracy world, kind age comes truckloads baggage. thought people may partially immune SARS-COV-2 due cross-reactivity coronaviruses, particular HCOV-NL63 (this one swamp coronaviruses permeate environment, vast majority known science produce mild symptoms, could different coronavirus provided partial immunity). thought reason children often show symptoms SARS-COV-2 infection, catch many Colds makes partially immune.

Anyway, HCOV-NL63 similar spike protein uses invade cells latching ACE2 cell receptor. antibodies HCOV-NL63 may give partial immunity SARS-COV-2.

It's thought that, partial immunity prevent people getting infected, likely remain asymptomatic viral number remain low.

And mild asymptomatic cases tend produce fewer antibodies SARS-COV-2, IgM IgG, research suggests antibodies make lost couple months, end testing negative. However, may remain immune.

There's new sophisticated tests developed detect immune response even asymptomatic mild cases months later looking different set immune markers, finding 98% exposed cases months later. coworker might yet test positive one newer tests.

That said, there's chance lucky. male customer workplace swears he’s person US whose heart rate drops wears mask. Timeframes changing leadership moving dont align pandemic progression, advice productive. comments show, political vengeance, public health. Fox news msm, can't stop sucking dick Great point. I’m dentist problems wearing working, walking parking lot mask 100F weather completely different experience - definitely feels like it’s harder breathe. Also virus mutate benign form, would become regular strain used seasonal flu shot. Bout damn time followed lead woman Michigan, DeWine. know actual LEADER? sued. would hesitate.  might it, main mitigating factor think lower deaths is, better protocols though wont' help hospitals get run such. course is. I’d never NEVER even think sending kid back school currently ! vaccines necessarily going work prolonged period. plenty evidence supporting antibodies last. eliminate killer t-cells alternative antibodies vaccine, (if true) eliminate one current vaccines. said Remdesivir vaccine, isnt an: already infected treatment. prevents nothing. hype vaccines savior relevant look science behind it. moderate effectiveness (according Fauci), would happy one 70% effective would end pandemic, time 10 would die now, would still leave 3 dead, good imo.

Not gloom not, speculation, common cold, another coronavirus yet eradicated around long human records. fastest way social distance mask up, governments serious punishing dont, way spread minimal much threat hospital system overloaded. seen, longer time goes medical professionals dealing this, better survival rates get. long arent overloaded death rates stay relatively low, Texas, Arizona, Florida perfect example.

Smoking produces tar formaldehyde bunch terrible carcinogenic matter. Nicotine anti inflammatory, mild analgesic, even demonstrated statistically significant correlation lowered incidences Parkinson's Alzheimers. 

Nicotine bad caffeine. 

It's smoke kills you. Well didn’t need see probably combination of:

* Increased testing, finds mild cases.
* New treatments, remdesivir, blood thinners prevent clotting, better understanding how/when use ventilators
* Deaths general trailing indicator: case spike recent people died yet. combines testing: since proactive testing finds cases earlier, deaths trail cases longer.
* Deaths much higher hospitals get overloaded. Since increased case count due better testing, overloaded last time case count high.

It also may current spike mostly younger people, viral loads lower (eg due mask usage), factor like mutation. Fresh property available businesses better suited current market.

Looking like know they’re top yep, beast endurance much sure. issue get it, antibodies built for, dont quote cant remember exact number, 3-4 years. Currently research Covid shows lasts couple months (the antibodies), return Every year even vaccinated unless research dozens countries wrong, unless get shot every 6 months so. Hopefully killer t-cell ""vaccine"" work, one shows promise antibodies disappear couple months. know! Yet less 15 covid deaths city. hospitals saying everyone dying covid, numbers would way, way higher. People believe anything see FB. cheese curds New Glarus though. tbf Surly things better New Glarus guess get Elsworth cheese curds anyway plus parents live there... Yeah let's blow bridges.

When went Wisconsin month ago, went small town island lake superior (to stay cabin 40 acres woods social distancing, whole point). Everyone wore masks, everywhere. required stores. one person could go (4 isle) grocery store time. really good it, even without order. said, place thrives tourism absolute best places... Well I'm sure supper clubs bars throughout state probably giving shit. Yep. means options. bring back boarding school perhaps. Yes, Autumn seriously worrying me. I'm NC, biggest hotspot here, come fall time... knows it'll look like us. seem like heat effect it. reason cold would expected same? assume people get tested illnesses. assume cold people want stay anyways. 

Some countries already winter seem like huge jump 

Really I'm curious don’t think anyone suggesting locking states obviously don’t need it. even frontline workers, still help case decrease. people like nurses, doctors, etc. vaccinated, less likely get able save lives, hospitals understaffed. Yes. is, say, world's smallest violin. 

(if american, explain you) Oh look! talking dick!

(Please downvote me, I'm also D) think fans leave masks comply orders get in? won’t even wear 20 minutes store make teenage girls cry screaming cursing them.  Ruptured appendix. happen untreated appendix problems iirc

PSA severe abdominal pain call doctor ASAP appendix problems left untreated bad small businesses closed large corps, people inside, remaining open? make sense you? Ugh ikr? want wfh again. Call us whatever want, can't pretend care people coming sick leaving halfway day illnesses. inject disinfectant carry on. It'll grand Nope. flu death rate case fatality ratio. 77% flu cases never counted they’re asymptomatic comparing CFR IFR nonsensical. also know NYC IFR least 1% COVID-19. 10X deadly low end potential range, depending statistics used, could well 50X higher rate. Remember CDC beginning June estimated 50k deaths uncounted based excess death data recorded deaths 100k. 60k estimated missing 30k. death count regularly 50% also makes calculated CFR IFR major underestimates. [CDC excess death info stats Johns Hopkins site. think thing back then. Polio rampant people tended listen experts rumors. Ah shit? legit idea. Thanks heads up! guys douche...never understood became continues famous. You’d think it’d obvious.... unfortunately I’m afraid it’s obvious everyone..... wait... start high school football 12 days. Facts DeSantis literally equivalent political meltdown right now. know bad protestors find ways shame mid press conference. one Monday particularly terrible, literally people screaming banging windows trying talk. 

If think it, governors never forefront crisis like due lack federal response.

For DeSantis, either stays open means people die calls shutdown state goes entirely broke. He's lose/lose situation see that. People literally protesting house lol. He's eviscerated right hitching wagon Trump like political kamikaze point.

You clearly see sleeping. see face. almost feel bad kind brought upon smug refusing mask mandate. Like dude, like he's driving towards cliff floored stupid. reason overseas Chinese want go back China China epidemic control.
It's prerequisite overseas Chinese return China.
If massive return overseas Chinese China allowed without quarantine, China also community infections, lot pressure China's current quarantine quarantine, far guess third Beijing's hotels become overseas quarantine hotels (this still government mandate, hotel owners want hotels housing possible coronavirus patients)
Do think Chinese overseas try return country allowed coronavirus pandemic similar US?
Your friends complaining you, one wants China pandemic US.
And even understand cause effect. testing patients. testing ensure frontline staff safe. know patient positive protect appropriately prevent infected ourself possibly spreading patients unit.  Beaverton school district going fully online. announced early next week. health care workers would serious trouble 3M fighting US orders. 

Lets real here. shit hit fan gesture clear enough. I’ll add Lowe’s list shop. Funny thing, CDC campus Dekalb County Ga. $8000 per student per year yet every student one one devices district upcoming school year that’s extended funding grants. weren’t even going one one upcoming school year, going two one...

Your country values education do. needs fundamental paradigm shift. install privileges PC? Download free edition TeamViewer install it, start anyway. history know, depressed get, see thing happening over, over, again, even countries even specific locations country experience figured decent solution watch everything crash burn cause unnecessary distress due pride corruption. may one depressing statistics I've ever read discussing family! need start hiring beefed mask bouncers enforce mandates. Mask get suplexed, Karens Kens! true, protests would massive spreader virus. 

I mean, sure, aren’t allowed contact trace back protests several states saw massive increases 1-2 weeks protests began, everyone assured protests didn’t spread virus. 

So clearly football stadiums won’t either. Governor dewine apologetic mandated masks first time talking mandatory masks going far. stuck guns. Makes think who's wagging dog. Good riddance :) True,but we're past point there's wards full children iron lungs.

If virus would awesome. forgot ""if want live fear, stay home"" ""we can't shut world forever virus kills less people flu."" ugh Playing devils advocate here... early twenty something &amp; god knows judgement skills age horrendous. Add fact 'realness'/threat Covid called question conspiracy theorists, leaders exact recipe kind situation. exactly need clear consistent messaging leadership... people need it, others. Ironically, hospitals hurting previous shut down. stopped elective procedures lost tons revenue. Florida, many hospitals stopping elective procedures patient admitted afterwards (to keep beds free covid). But, still procedures sent home day. anything keep cash incoming. googled found instances gi lead Fauci scientist calling remdesivir vaccine. Almost everything NY that's indoors closed. No, statement patently absurd necessary. 201, 5.4 million children lived grandparents. I'll bet plenty still working support child. That's good person people wear support wearing masks.

The problem lack masks but, instead, fact we've reopened economy.

Most patients wear masks. work outside house, though. hell think this? shovel shit countries time. trash, low paying jobs, bank accounts, high paying jobs, citizens mistaken immigrants, soldiers, debt, companies... scientist one companies OWS.

I can't seem get people. like imagine I'll carrying around bunch hand out.

I might lucky get vaccinated quickly critical employees. promises though.... don’t understand point you’re trying make. know stay home we’re sick do. means strain spread quality. don’t know say clearer that. 

Are American? people tend follow public health guidelines get tested stay home even suspect might covid. personally I'd happy since would generate business DeSantis worse incompetent, seems actively trying high score like video game. referring death rates per capita. 
UK: 68.22 per 100k  US: 42.83 per 100k (as July19)
Yeah we're hot infection rates far citizens far greater number densely populated areas UK. 
I expect rates get worse though. Unfortunately Today NPR pointed death rate low mid-April, like win. Back ""numbers rise"". put marker calendar tomorrow death rate 2% two weeks see 1,245 newly reported deaths. Thanks Coronavirus? THANKS poorly educated Americans selfish follow basic rules. 1,000 isn’t many deaths one day millions people percentage low. 

No joke that’s say. Ha good luck that. sure fuck aren’t sending kids school state tells county online classes (our county offering online classes signed that) simple. going economy reign Covid. opening make money pandemic self defeating kills lot people economic gain. referring far DeSantis goes state. guys keys worst people showing town. half state 100% tourist funded ATM numbers low. expect last. Thanks! haven’t heard used either. “Who cares?” - DJT   “Who cares?” - DJT They're mostly dead. This. “Who cares?” - DJT weird practically already immune. Even company sued, it'd covered worker's compensation insurance. it'd hard, impossible, prove infected work. No, that's it. one cite issued June 2020, protests looting (and now) still occurring, meaning least data would need rely exist yet; conclusion mass protests looting increase coronavirus transmission appears conjecture, possibly ideologically-driven bullshit. “Who cares?” - DJT random draw bottled water probably body trying save itself? I’m going go that. “Who cares?” - DJT Trusting CDC wearing mask solution, problem, friend. handle like every case passenger endangering others uncooperative. Turn plane around, land, police escort off, add no-fly list. “Who cares?” - DJT one Dalian,Liaoning ,a employee works seafood factory ，the track recent days reported , I've heard rumors detail mentioned:

the report said employee came around neighbour downstairs , Chinese netizens claimed neighbour Xinjiang (not sure returned Xinjiang recently)

So still rumor, got infected imported seafood contact ppl Xinjiang ?

Thers still conclusion ,further investigation needed.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: morning 2 confirmed cases 12 asymptomatic carriers reported Dalian ,13 14 r workshop. TAKE TIME STUPID DICK MCCONELL, keep laughing stupid bastard true thank pointing masks available covid vaccine [A recent study released last week S. Korea suggested kids 10 bad transmitters. Apparently kids 10-19 years old much spreaders adults.

Edit : kids 10, still risk-free still possible long term effects. Data going fact, obviously. Yelp horrible business practices. Honest question, I’m know Yelp used app times. “Who cares?” - DJT analytical response hoping for. Don’t know? *we best mortality rates* often get flu last days, know much different much worse. People's rational congregant Roger goodell money give fuck safety US economy system would hardly survive extended lockdown. people benefit current system interest seeing happen.   denier? provided data. numbers still equal 20%.  That's what's going happen us government office allow us work home Good luck finding number that. Testing states cluster fuck right now. Everyone mama testing center there's centralized clearing house data. testing facilities backlogged moment though, understandably. teams can't afford butts seats. I'm pessimistic season happening anyway. go free tickets, I'm huge fan that's several Superbowls. I'd love wrong, what's going Covid right now, I'm skeptical event next 8-12 months. worries, deaths drop dramatically gov't takes numbers completely  Democratic Party US center right best. happens leaning little left rest Republican Party. Yeah remember thinking odd shifted directions start reopening anticipating shut bit longer. I'm sure pressure Pence probably helped push direction (I'm assuming around time). Marion County opt extend shutdown past Gov Holcomb's order good least. 

I hope another spike Holcomb right thing let us become another Florida, Texas, Arizona, etc. seems better, responsible person governors though makes feel bit better situation. Same. stocked drawers $7 yoga pants Target month back. Get fucked, real pants. That’s mistake. That’s negligent homicide. omg masks restrict oxygen cause acne hurt ears cause hearing loss lead loss freeeedomsss...

same people...covid worse flu kills old people..

i can't believe live country deadly virus considered benign mask deadly weapon actually sat next CEO company meeting pandemic hit. presenting, watching may may recognize me. still trust supervisor back. employment offer got put hold weekly therapy HR sure would work supervisor care long said going be. Menthol smokes delicious people know would rather die economy though

And people die coronavirus catch it.

And many people even catch it. Sweden's much control Tegnell estimates 1 5 stockholmers it. amount people dying cancer spreading increasing daily

1. Herd immunity. evidence antibodies T-cells coronavirus

2. Vaccine

3. unlikely situation everyone US got still ONE TIME 3.5 million deaths assuming death rate 1%. Even think death rate higher, keep mind 2.8 million people total die US EVERY YEAR: people die many years life left anyways, bioethics standard consider this. Yea North Carolina get 290 week Woopty, I’m gonna sell McConnell Russians might get 100 bucks greasy bloodsucker  Unfortunately another option, it’s force.

We force kids back schools force parents put schools forcing go back work won’t provide basic assistance working class Americans global crisis. 

We’ve ladies gentlemen. longer lag counting deaths, attributing deaths causes due different criteria.

Personally, like hope better understanding treat social distancing reduces viral load. 2,000 deaths day weeks end numbers mysteriously dropped. Ahhh. remember one last time. classic. ""They said covid death actually died able breath.""    Yes. Firable officials fired. Sheriffs reelected. Superiors fire reelected. keep rolling tracks plowed idiots. sad. Voters need show show distaste. Geez. thought “yay”, experience also something afraid US also claimed Huawei stole American 5G technology, Huawei leads world 5G thing American 5G technology. :) places need hire security duty cop enforce it. windmills covering up. Dad? Yeah here. **Texas’** first drive-thru strip club. **the** first drive-thru strip club. Texas’. Yeah, anyone thinks purely LPN/APNs issue met enough RNs. said, totally worse RNs. agree. congress? could Behold! Part problem! Like, can't imagine Thanksgiving Christmas COVID world. people sense traveling see family, people gonna broke around Christmas, feels super depressing unending. course paid death... would ever given money patient died? one claiming that. Beating semantic Straw Man argument good. whole claim incentive lie what, X number end dead COULD THEORETICALLY inflated numbers deaths.

So people treated die, cause death? Geez guys damn stubborn call side oblivious fact-denying. sad.

Please like them.... claim incentive lie covid relevant. claim true. true evidence actually COMMITING fraud.

Why guys like this? Like point possible incentive lie, give better counter argument ad hom me. Why?

smh dude make us look bad Anyone know many signatures 7rump received show support? curious. Contrary think lot people want believe society hope for, doctors good doctors sheer brute force memorization repeating procedures based things see. 

And good, especially need someone degree specialization field knowledge experience performance pressure. 

But necessarily guarantee someone good critical thinking, even extraordinarily good medical practice. Indian government started citing recovery rate success fight covid. Duh. Like increase. cannot imagine someone saying straight face understanding callous, ignorant, racist sound. RemindMe! 30 days  constantly move goal post, it’s pointless even bother them. know *every* state they're in, swear many New Hampshire. Lots people saying death rate low. I'm still seeing people calling ""scamdemic"" anywhere directly effect them. told first responder Broward County Florida. places, feel bad people responds to. need stop testing. /s original source Border Report, hell that? TIL original spelling ""lede"" think problem dealing deal facts logic, think everyone too. So, think showing factual information somehow bring people senses.

We show facts want. They’ve crafted alternative reality bubble ignorance good knowledge. Imagine Abrams won. 5 ways get anti-mask Americans wear a.....eh-hem *cough* face-covering? (Definitely mask though). Still shocked virus come US people saying “the flu kills people” 

I swear lot people idea infectious diseases work. think infects entire country overnight? Yes Trump sucks Cuomo, Murphy Wolfe get pass? kidding know answer.  need grow balls society start putting collective foot down. Stop business them. Turn away door. take answer, matter loudly shouted. get violent, time go pokey.

As soon run food comply. hard eat can't go inside grocery store. Headlines like really make question things There's ""Not Safe"", there's ""Actively Courting Death"". I'd like avoid second; think that's much ask. hate handshaking, would happy never came back. facilities locations smallpox, awesome US wants pull away WHO... Well know higher, much higher. hookers three titties? 100% get that. There's bunch phrases get comments insta-deleted. R e e one them. annoying. mods claim want political talk sorry mods, lot discussion around virus inherently political. way around it. Deleting bunch random ass comments contain certain common political phrases helpful all. Let's make clear asking hypothetical. one discussion said whether protesting grocery shopping (indoors) less likely spread covid. said need empirical data that.

Clearly, groceries needed, ability grocery shop. Even so, stores enacted lot rules around grocery shopping, like mask wearing lower store capacities. Many stores one way aisles insist social distancing waiting line.

Political protest clearly different kind activity going stadium sports concerts. takes lot gets forcibly shut down. Commercial activity much different.

It seems stadium sports could made safe, requirements make would drastically cut margins possible even make worth effort increased risk. Look rules around NBA bubble. possible though data comes in, find open air bathrooms stadiums thoughtful people go out, risk might really low. Leagues ready test that. Spoiler alert won’t. It’s enforced counties stores it’s already mandated, nothing going change.   interesting look problems germany response reacted compared US praise it.

Germany US relatively alike state structure: federalized. Unlike countries like france, every bundesland, like states US, decide corona response. theory, bavaria could said 'i wont it', like US.

Germany brand rightwing conspiracy theorists. powerful, without influence, too.

One reason german response worked germany far less partisan. Trump took stance corona real masks bad democrats would take warned corona.  
Obviously, reps also business interests mind, Merkel's party, CDU, also close business big corp. problem.

But here, government consists two biggest parties (at least recently biggest), center left center right. third biggest party mostly agreed measures rightwing conspiracy theorists started acting time (but dont lot power parliament). 
There big party media tried dissuade people wearing masks following government.

Also, unlike US, germany several state TV channels. merkel others (govenors bundesländer, ministers) able give unbiased info coordinated other, slowly communicate measures one another.

The problem companies solved promising lot money. Basically 'yes, company nice time, give lots money, dont fire people keep calm', could done measure could taken quickly whole parliament page here.

After time, merkel faces problem US: bundesländer acted wanted less measures. point, couldnt really keep demanding get economy back track (as could force them).

However, least convinced emergency measure : city high covid numbers, get back quarantine measures instantly restarted. 

After exhausted power stamina far domestic politics go, instantly went foreign politics concentrates EU now, coordinating germany countries stop EU falling apart trying get economy back track combatting effects crisis.

So like everything perfect germany magic place everyone rational corp interests play role, consensus workaround found mostly, paid off.

The corona numbers stagnate higher i'd like be, far reopening led second wave (but numbers falling anymore, too, reason caution).  verbally bully virus submission? think mixture both. think lied much happened lockdown, local cases etc. prior first weeks certainly do. spreading unchecked/being covered up/misunderstood least begining November lockdown. footage came Wuhan, plus evidence broke through, Wuhan look like got hit hard NY. 

However, think actually learnt that. left fucking Alamo yall get fuck together see coming tell thought fastest way would relying people wearing masks. Always surprised people don’t know Pfizer makes Advil specifically humans won't/can't stay perfect isolation 2 whole months keeps spreading back forth across countries, mutating goes?

Yep, basically. Stuff like cold, seem get variants again. first year kid enrolled daycare results kid sick various colds year long.. means various viruses floating around. might eradicate anti-vaxxers. Bayesian US whole reporting 1200 deaths today far, places still left report think needed hear that, thanks man using ourworldindata COVID set. think numbers little different worldometer. easier download play with. Even showed 100% recovery rate received ivermectin treatment vs. 100% fatality control group, you’d see last line.

Obviously read first line assumed referring study, I’m free amused pretend otherwise. Old school like natural selection first organism. Yes. Paywalled done lot, felt outside pressure, gave political cohorts. potential keep things control hesitated. initial big speeches talked hesitating past, make mistake again. started strong fell cliff Oh mental thing alright. cough cough USA

Great, we're going get it, coughing they? Oh absolutely. It’s I’m United fortress hub Delta token shuttle Atlanta pretty much  understand saying, saying bc side effects, going get approved? Yeah, use Gmail address suspect almost made believe bogus submission, made 5G conspiracy theorist, using person's identity. 

However, looked joint publications Massimo Fioranelli Torello Lotti, seems like operating little academic paper mill help bump publication count others. publications related dermatology cardiology mostly super simple medical lit reviews, anything outside filled incredibly crudely-drawn figures insane biophysics  install norton are. They're also terrible economy. I'm honestly surprised nobody tried kill Donaldo yet  Interesting job. 

I'm sure people get ridiculous amount deaths either never model predicting mild case Covid though (non-hospital felt like dying 2 weeks, 3 months recovery) certainly see people dying good clip. Scary stuff. I’m talking teachers students obviously. evidence even use either side besides anecdotal evidence. meant New York California total like 1/4 country, students course. Iran's 2nd wave chart shows deaths lag cases 3 - 4 weeks. honestly think daily deaths could 2x 3x next 3 - 4 weeks. direction. North Korea 0 cases. labor force going massive, Covid sized hole coming decades... That's heartless man, say that. dad symptoms got tested Monday, doc thinks might UTI he's trouble urinating. Every one numbers life, statistic. family, friends, hopes dreams. Even side aisle, they're still human. I'm confused. He's completely right. lot people pulled guns assaulted workers stores. think that's better small chance getting covid? Really? lost fucking minds. places isn’t already thing? Like seriously wtf guys.

I got masks short supply ended LONG AGO Fair point... set tarot cards says 6mil! cost rest world 1/80th that. live Costa Mesa 1 mile FREEDUM lovers unfortunately confirm. source 30-day lag time? Everything I've read shows average 14 days illness onset death, roughly. upvote me. vote counts. counts votes. exist. I’m sure lot people working something like that. exist certainly ten years ago.

Unless you’re referring something like quantum dots...which obviously people referring to.  guy wants play pandemic nightmare mode. Perhaps, that's including asymptomatic people. experience symptoms get positive test, death rate applies super low one applies cases. figures. work masks required enforced. 75% workforce wear chin strap. ended Covid place. proved moral test.

How thing do?

Let's state again: never said wearing one. am, however, skeptical us setting mandates place. 

And ""prove"" care anything. already know do! test, get hospitalization Maybe hormones talking lost love life, half, person swore oath follow grave jackass micromanaging piece shit decided everyone go back crowd around staff meetings, bet ass following one taking motherfuckers me. 


They want selfish petty, I. douche question 20 million subscribers. assume video gets views 10% them, works $8,000 per video ad revenue alone (which probably fraction one earns sponsorship money). Said douche put 8 videos last month.  Ooooh 2.4% based inflection points. start upswing deaths might lower might go higher positive rate weeks ago. Isn’t video best! imagine 60 million people saw said “Hey use guy like White House”?  think know second recess Pip... would obvious. one thing corrupt administration might avoid detection slowly creep numbers instead seeing 40% drop single day. even slow creep widely criticized...if that's what's happening.

Hospitals still report data places like [Johns also rely [this I've specifically reached asking data would potentially become tainted response, they've posted data aggregated county state level official sources. still access trustworthy data, long counties states reporting them.  many countries averaged 200+ stretch? top head: Italy, Spain, France, England, Germany, Belgium, Brazil, Columbia, India Iran Mexico? 

To fair states chance hit mark ever due population What? No, people can’t visit Vietnam. There’s currently tens thousands Vietnamese citizens still waiting repatriation flights commercial flights coming in. one last commercial flights March even tested quarantined government facility. agree it’s something people WANT it’s something should’ve enforced. countries paying price lax response. Damn. Well glad hear people starting take seriously least. Uh oh. what's next estimate 14 days now? governor dragging feet

heh treatable still 10% fatal. God help bubonic plague every becomes transmissible Meanwhile Europe... shit. health department usually shuts businesses though since state mask mandates basically toothless I've got better idea. Give workers pepper spray allow use dumb pieces shit. We're pandemic fucks sake. morons whatever want called die something Rona DeathSentence think couple scroll bit lol Lying fear mongering turdlet. reports exist. mean... that's completely accurate representation. Lol like nearly self-aware, saying “we know abstinence doesn’t work” hear go say something along lines “but think people totally go masks sex” makes think: tax dollars hard work? Magic face underwear. ""I turned location tracking phone. want anyone know am."" 
""Wow, must go lot data."" 
""No, I'm logged WiFi."" would get lower number confirmed deaths? guess you’re suggesting case extrapolation inaccurate case whole view would much variability it’s nonsensical. contract virus? ok like there. Crafty bastard sea

Yeah keep buying new carrier divisions people get anything done

So good theirr unrivaled arsenal they're going use it? Also, *need* global security America spend last seventy years systematically fucking many foreign communist-friendly countries, nay *regions* can, replacing literal terrorists.

Fucking useless.

*edit: third-person tense*   Wonder still people arguing dEaThS DeCrEaSiNg Yeah? Bc thats Georgia said. texas, Florida, every state rushed reopen ""low"" cases.

I'm 50/50 split running shorts pajama shorts 7 days week point. think I've worn jeans since April.  Might explain hospitalizations reaching maximum instead climbing further. numbers can‘t go turn 'em away! Nonsense. I'm sure people willing take personal responsibility callous disregard others' health life. Besides, die bootstrap parachute fails, fails obviously work hard enough properly maintain it. first time model lower death projection IHME isn't. Northern new England flat decreeing. Southern new England flat slightly increasing. None new england states rising spiking time sad even need experts back credentialed expert get mouth breathers wear masks yep, major problem disease takes long time recover from. hospital beds get taken longer. means less beds. means everything much lethal. immunologist studies respiratory infections pisses maybe most. counting purpose, misidentifying COVID deaths believe dumbasses respiratory infection leads cardiovascular symptoms results death! SARS-CoV-2 particular seems really good inducing non-pulmonary symptoms/deaths whatever reason, I've seen reports extreme blood clotting, heart attacks, necrosis extremities, etc. incentive make shit up. Getting flu shot easy free. usually takes less 10 minutes like minimum 40% less chance getting it. see anyone wants risk pnemonia sake day sore shoulder year. Yes record 1 day. !remindme 2 months Try finding family doctor Quebec, tell it’s broken. Dont take personally. Please stay USA. 2020 fucked even Delta Airlines trying right thing.

Greetings Brazil. 🇧🇷 plateau much higher level several weeks (at least, started come down, levelling, seems least..) 50% Americans surveyed back June said would get vaccine Covid-19 available.

As far supply goes, want say last estimate saw something like 5 years global coverage 80%? entire fucking planet! Sure, every leader hates dumdum (except Putin), it’s giant worldwide conspiracy. talking (I think hell knows basically tiny tattoo. know mark beast Bill Gates.  What? point even trying make?  deepstate benefits dont know? wanna hurt Trump anyway possible. friends uncle Facebook told knew someone died accident cause death changed covid, even though that's died. obvious...


/s honestly people literally say Facebook lol  Hard say sure deaths. Everytime think get reliable trend track deaths switches. Cases began rising 40 days ago, deaths increasing 16 days. would imply least three weeks increase follows.

Either way, I'll take cases leveling finally. hope stays way.

Edit - since like math: current growth rate next two weeks we'll 1700 deaths day. kidding. would like making cat wear mask. Good luck! Thank pointing out, fact IFR estimate time corrected outcomes active cases beyond embarrassing someone Indiana. 0.58% 6x deadly numbers keep getting repeated they're garbage.   stop counting dead, means dead.

This best must talking Fauci. People think falsifying deaths completely. people die COVID yes paying treatments due treatments it. People think someone dies heart attack stroke listing COVID whether vents, got treatments even tested. “Grandma stroke died immediately? listed COVID money” line reasoning have. also inflated numbers deaths “fake disease isn’t bad flu”. technically wrong ask ""in capacity?""

Many people America retirement plan. broke AF.

70% lives paycheck paycheck (meaning savings buy stocks).

The matter fact stock market irrelevant 75% country. Odds good mutations weaker helps thing die off, stronger freak one always come raring back sometime.

I hope come back way Spanish Flu mutated 1919. Careful, they’ll accuse happy deaths call shit Oh awful hospital staff rejected patients.  Bindi Irwin small ceremony family members.

I'm accounting them, needed estimate. case fatality uses diagnosed cases. “ it’s okay cause deaths low” people now?? Also labor intensive jobs like factory work similar effects. intensified heavyset. beds personnel, else done? ton unmasked white folk pictures. risk we’re willing take Well went 100 0 lol  one month actual shutdown coordinated federal level would stopped thing literally months ago. could see going supreme court someone contested correctly. could argued infringement right expression/speech (which, iirc, includes clothing), well infringement self autonomy, since people could right decide risk (I know masks best worn people spreading, lets ignore moment). However, counter argument could masks would attempt regulate ones conduct public, rather expressions, would rule constitutional. Additionally, since would interest public’s safety, scientifically proven. agree national mask mandate would extremely beneficial, believe federal government currently power so, since little precedent. Additionally, would guidelines government fall? Would need wear mask going inside building, crowded sidewalk? defines crowded? walking family outdoors, would masks necessary near anyone else? Would opening windows/doors make building count ‘outdoors’? would forced/what would penalty be? answers could vary region, quite honestly don’t answers places since local mask mandates enforced, incredibly likely national one also unenforced. Please (anyone) feel free prove wrong, especially federal powers part. engineering student, study government structures all. Better masks seal tightly around bridge nose prevent glasses fogging.

Glasses fog exhaling going around mask it.  Lmao stating specific situation Also 5G cellular network spread Covid-19.. good thing today. 

I supposed go college on-campus continue communications degree. COVID-19 shit-storm, decided go online notice, I’m also business major (marketing, specific). 

Good moves around. Oh, already masks respirators. wanted masks 11 year old goddaughter relatives trust enough know properly handle mask. wish sold stores near me. Thank you! Hope learned lesson lives raise awareness. Yes, course.

The problem hospitals stand profit misdiagnosing patient, patient covid-19 mild/no symptoms needs hospitalized unrelated reasons. That's weird going say Texas shit hole last time one, year ago, one person working whole store! difference Canada wouldn’t withhold life saving supplies us spite Trump. 

We long lasting friendship Canadian people existed long exist long Trump gone. 

One shitty leader can’t break bonds friends north.  sucks same. husband baby different lady. lady got kicked baby. third wheel. estimates 0.6-1% fatality rate. 

That IFR, OP using CFR DeSantis added districts need additional weeks prepare reopening ""have it"" teachers need work remotely pandemic allowed to. 

“Let’s find way make do,"" said. “While risk students in-person learning low, cost keeping schools closed enormous."" 

It’s almost crazy admit... might actually first signs doubt fear guy.. Well I’m going change mind, however I’ll post articles relation videos referring to.... would better actually listen, research read someone directly “what nutty fear monger guy never heard speak gave chance is. already know everything guy haven’t even heard him” Fauci talking mutation!!!!! fear monger!!!!!!

Wait PHD Pathology Duke university?!? better listen random guy reddit instead They're still running line, actually COVID19 would 6th leading cause death US, [if go death statistics taken believe saw article saying actually deflated. 

Significantly pneumonia deaths heart failures period last year. increase probably Covid deaths; possibly hidden deaths related diseases got final push covid paved way weakened body like diabetes diseases probably statistically high. feel pain. currently done for: 

1. HCQ might work, dangerous side effects highly exaggerated

2. Dr. Fauci lied masks effective ""healthy"" people pandemic

3. virus may lab origin

**Mark words.** I'm even trumpster, republican, conspiracist. 

Time tell.  get money treating Covid patients side they’ve losing ton money highest income categories elective surgeries. Nobody wants go hospital elective surgery risk getting covid. 

As usual, low intelligence people see one factor look bigger picture. part comment ""factual""? lol

Are Chinese citizens free fly back homeland, like anyone else different passport country? im trying limit exposure tbh, brain worms contagious. Covid third leading cause death US year, exist last year, think people overreacting by, what, wanting shelter it?

Okay did. Actually, believe book team originally set W. Bush feeling there’d pandemic something, Obama expanded it, 45 defunded it, likely thinking waste money. 

The failure response president’s fault, already trying rewrite history, though. 1.01% price difference draw line May humidity high temp also. I'm border Shenzhen, 14m people total 460 cases 3 deaths. new case 150 days so. good tracing apps, thermal screening, high levels mask compliance, hard beat this.

Anyone able go couple hours without eating drinking.  testing good. I’m favor testing, especially protect hospital workers prevent nosocomial infections. 

But OP implied crazy conspiracy theory say hospitals financial incentive test patients, classify / code COVID, even patients hospitalized reason don’t serious case COVID. 

I find interesting situations (especially subreddit), Reddit 100% certain hospitals (which primarily non-profit US) motivated solely greed, bilking patients worth. Yet, supposed believe hospitals, finances ruins due pandemic, would turn chance earn 20% patients testing classifying ICD-10s differently? many posts sub seen, thousands upvotes, hospitals supposedly firing nurses complained PPE, (allegedly) save buck? opt anonymous mobile data tracking, FYI.

Fioranelli gmail address. posts website CV list publications. also papers published. massimo.fioranelli@gmail.com whereas paper regarding covid 19 use m.fioranelli73@gmail.com. two covid papers claim come show publication list.

Every time see dumb face come news, remember gloating May brilliant response covid, remember blaming Hispanic farm workers beginning outbreak, remember blaming ""young people"", remember saying close gyms people ""in good shape""... can't fucking deal guy. 

In sane world, him, Abbott TX, Ducey AZ, Kemp GA...they would get tossed jail done. Instead, Trump probably build statues them. 2020 worst.  wouldn’t spread rate? they’re contagious symptoms show (so, anyone sick) they’re going spread fairly evenly. soon symptoms show people staying home isn’t spread. spread similar rates. 

The point I’m trying make comment’s logic flawed. virus won’t mutate become less lethal like many specifically spreads presymptomatically. . \#NukeCovid close eyes see virus. Checkmate lib  Lots YouTubers can't say ""coronavirus"" get demonetized. funny names it. Yes make eat know Evansville delayed 2 weeks, I’m sure Warrick. hope re-evaluate 2 weeks. I’m really worried kids. still flight masks required, never put on, lied said pulled eat/drink, airline fly let get away it. 

Still waiting... matter evidence display people, they'll never change mind. work 24 hour shifts EMT wear face mask anytime I'm ambulance station. wear N95 mask anytime come contact patient flu like symptoms, Covid-19 positive not. They're uncomfortable wear certainly hard breath in. tried explaining someone wear one 24 hours certainly wear one minutes picking groceries. turn said I'm able wear one work heavly ventilated environment. Patients homes definitely heavly ventilated. work hoarder houses filled smokers, pet dander, dust. Nothing change peoples minds. would make lot sense reported truthfully. saying. I've feeling pretty doom gloom, too. Reading Q3 reports seeing things going, yeah... I'm optimistic Can't fucking count number arguments I've coworkers. 

Really, anything... death case numbers massively undercounted. Hundreds people per day NYC alone dying homes, even able get tested. deaths Covid counted directly related disease, tested positive. 

Fucking... no. Hospitals overinflating death counts federal funds. mean? disagree comments let sit 1 week. timeframe might appropriate casual contact covid cases like items store mail laptop used covid patient going want let sit month room temperature 50% average humidity. CDC study Japan cruise ship still finding virus 28 days. Also, since touching keyboard turning cooling fan would aerosol-generating, use gloves month either. read post? basically said admirable job. hate idea massively irresponsible decisions regarding COVID end hurting healthcare workers.

It's never fair world. fucking preventable Reporting also lag it. state FL says takes 14 days. example yesterday reported 132 death look many people died dashboard yesterday says 15 deaths yesterday. addition deaths taking longer hospitalizations/cases, reporting adds lag. 

dashboard website 

 *The Deaths Day chart shows total number Florida residents confirmed COVID-19 died calendar day (12:00 - 11:59 PM). Death data often significant delays reporting, data within past two weeks updated frequently.* They've already said going free. comment heard friends deny : deaths then?

First, there's ""novel"" virus. Like one, shows up, there's defense. H1N1, aka Spanish Flu, H3N2, aka Hong Kong Flu, this, burned out/had treatments developed prevent spread, even MERS SARS (still around, particularly active).

Respiratory viruses pretty difficult *eliminate* spread easily, milder ones (even COVID's virus ""mild"" compared SARS MERS, kill much quickly often) tend keep hosts alive spread. evolve, natural selection tends cause virus become less deadly. suspected happened four mysterious coronaviruses cause common cold (there many viruses cause common cold, 4 coronaviruses). suspected entered human population long-gone pandemic.  Climate change cannot stopped point. train left station Al Gore's watch. even sure mitigated much point, given realities situation. path world leader. They're already saying look odds dying low is.  Hey dumb fuck, idk tell people make executive order. find extremely hard believe almost anyone congress would fight you. Oh wait, base fucking clueless vote now. God country fucking fucked. 1918 flu moment kind green tobacco talking here? death rate going even increasing cases? thought mortality rate remained constant function number cases. 1%, 1 100 die. 10 1,000. 100 10,000 etc...

but saying death rate going down. virus become mutated become weaker? new therapy reduce mortality? trying kick store 

you let inside first place, put big burly person entrance exit keep people w/o masks coming inside. there's vaccine. people dying COVID due anti-vaxx stupidity, one going care anymore. hope get sued ground. Work home big deal say yes to.

I think talking I'm unable find references British lab smallpox. article remember saw it? light matter.

Here initial disease become endemic without vaccine, too. 

A disease due body’s response disease-agent (virus, bacteria, etc). virus would become endemic; disease would prevalent endemic. bad thing, becomes another bug floats around. 

It could bad, bad, etc. there's reinfection, unlikely second infection would worse first, time, could become another version common cold.

Incorrect. would persist SARS-virus may cause pneumonia, clotting-issues, unknown complications, death portion population. 

We yet understand immune response vaccine virus. know happen future. 

Biology complicated way speak it. It’s easy get lost details. example: ‘The virus’ exist. Rather, collection closely-related viruses subtle differences. Furthermore, reassortment recombination makes ‘collection closely-related viruses’ function ‘open’ rather ‘closed’ system information. gets even complex begin talk human immune system, individual genetic sociological differences, on. 

It imperative effective, proactive, preventative national response pandemic. speaking casually potentially dangerous situation. reason response. Fuck suck Mitch ugliest motherfucker alive &amp; one needs wear mask non Corona virus related reasons one pic without one.

I'm seriously thinking might game Plague Inc.  Tbh actually think saying might good chance pushing people start wearing one.

Please don’t alter article titles. Sub rules. Although you’re wrong. Told smartest people, smart chart? There’s disagreeing there’s making outrageous statement meant get reaction.

At point actually believe they’re saying information - unreasonable. lag lag standard deviation, see Gaben awkward interviews 😭😭😭 cited quote injecting disinfectant! cut mentioned disinfectant. Kinda dishonest. Like Trump. Dont forget ""it's old people people problems already"" yellow banana flavored ones favorite guess get free.

Same. mandated county while, still see people refusing wear them. That's true, know rate tests error (which do), mathematically adjust diagnosis condition. done multiple seroprevelence studies, think one would much different. ability detect sarcasm really broken? Oh wow, that's basically nothing already saw cited Florida since white house took reporting CDC. course going new thing hahah   would pretty effective Worst day deaths, globally, since April 21. really plans it. governor suing biggest city right strike mask mandate.  That's we're right now, let's let marinate bit. comment indeed moderated try civil next time. 
It's interesting stubborn this

I think might watched it, even back March, knew course I'm safer I'm walking around N95 mask. clear making costs/benefit equation understood main point PPE healthcare workers valuable, strategic standpoint, ""freedom"" walk around fairly confident get sick die. 

And equation still true. still walk around hand sewn cloth masks (started wearing March) must out, mostly stay home. live area mostly o.k. this. hospital worker needs mask do. 

At time said understand high level asymptomatic transmission. sure role fomites played. reasons gave still exist- watch people walk around nose time. can't help fiddling mask. 

Maybe care much Fauci stepped admitted wrong, yet called liar again. Meanwhile, lie indisputable lie passes lips leaders never take responsibility. lie lie lie. One [20,0000 verifiable see Dr. Fauci honorable man threading way small treacherous needle, absolute best interest health nation. lots liars administration, he's one. Paywall alert! Narrator: bad. this. People screaming deaths skyrocket hospitals overwhelmed bodies piling hallways, etc. Still waiting.

~ you, earlier today

Also here's reply comment yesterday, somebody said, you, realize already explained another thread, fact repeating bullshit makes clear really looking answer instead looking spread bullshit around. case anyone else reading understand: people work weekends. Deaths reported Monday people whose deaths reported state Sunday. often times, deaths get reported state weekend show state totals look daily deaths see clear drop Sundays Mondays jump back Tuesdays. also everyone looks 7 day trends. 7 day trend deaths continues trend upwards. Plus, lot people think they've flu really not. !RemindMe 1 month India 30-40k range last week so, 19-25k range

Japan also worst daily new case figures since started: asshole takes mask soon they're airborn? So...you're saying simply care dead kids mass shooting? teen suicides caused bullying takes place schools?

Why perfectly fine kids dying entirely preventable scenarios? Think many kids would still us schools closed Columbine. No, planned middle pandemic, booked room May 29 believe that. bet got great deal due pandemic. husband's job NYC dep frustrating rollout wfh. eventually got stay home, really dragged feet letting people stay home. He's manager, lot legwork get done managers staying home work. leadership city- mayor saying businesses wfh getting agencies anything. Government agencies really dropped ball. says terrible economy? They’re making money! Rampant corruption good stuff, they’re best economy! basically murica. Every day better next. agree Trump never said inject disinfectant. work home starting tomorrow anyways. peaked April mostly New York. 

Now several places wirh potential become New York I'm trump fan I'm also glad war mongerer win.  Friends want get together entire family. said we're yet got belittled. 

Staying cautious gotten far. 60% die too, since every dose vaccine provide complete functional immunity every person, vaccinated people still likely get sick unvaccinated 30% drag outbreak. Vaccine deployment still going need coupled social distancing / masks / quarantine / isolation time. house parties anyone good long yet.  Kind hard effective charge wont take many others advice, he's blame. Asia outside China : 10

Why ""Asia outside China""? mean Koreans somehow reporting cases coming China? Why?  Obviously. point stands two consecutive sentences article apparently literally contradictory. Note preceding sentence also refers ""beds"". USA fucking stupid. want out. Yeah keep hearing beautiful Vietnam is. U.S. go one desirable destinations becoming poster child derision? I’m sorry, rhetorical question. Countries testing US (per capita): UAE, Denmark, UK, Iceland, Singapore, Russia, Israel, Qatar

I'd love see source saying one lower mortality rates, numbers Johns Hopkins University ranked US ninth *highest* time Trump declared US lowest. currently sitting 11th highest today. Definitely one lower rates interpretation.  They'll say ""wulp that's 20 per state"" schools opening NJ. live Sussex one word official plan yet. Also, school starts September NJ post confusing hell me. Ok. happens if/when refuses vacate? forcibly removes him? Yeah. stop 365k easily double it. It’s ok he’s Europe they’re laughing us burn 5G towers spread virus shallow take situation though. allowing cars exist ""willing let innocent people die"" result risk-benefit analysis determine provides greatest health well-being society whole long-run? Banning cars 100% correct move thing care lowering death rate. Instating curfew one allowed night also right thing thing care minimizing death rate.

Yet one argues that, people able see cause/effect nuance situations - COVID-19 virus suddenly exist vacuum nothing else matters? deaths - negative consequences - matter, long deaths COVID-19 minimized much possible? make sense. literally worst fear Honestly, could worn one earlier, praised governors issue mask mandates, probably wouldn’t become big deal. 

She already Michigan mask mandate awhile. There’s much travel within states states can’t close borders other. fish rots head. People dying probably going indoor bars (since 70+). They're secondary transmissions people (grandkids, children, cashiers, nurses, etc.)  Trump admitted yesterday would get worse gets better. They'll say ""this expected reopening, give time we'll get this"" 

Numbers matter anymore. could hit half million mean much :( fact needs headline..... Yeah, Meijer Dayton days ago. Sign front clearly said ""masks required"", bunch folks walking around without them. '100 million doses immediately upon approval' pretty damn huge considering got fast tracked aswell.

Approval vaccine imminent point Yesterday California 11,435 new cases 119 new deaths. reading right 273 people lost lives 2 day span? They'll believe whatever side tells to, long keep right, people wrong. Hahahahahhahahahahahhs fo real? can't pick phone call someone? Wtf? Give number I'll realize virus global, right?

Or think November 4th, dissappear world wide??

I never understood conspiracy??? shit thinking frustrating. work major non-profit hospital we're STRUGGLING covid. We've make major cuts spending we've lay offs / furloughs. We'd rather covid bullshit back normal. Sounds like don’t get it. depression level unemployment. said done, fed bought congress used bailouts every man woman child could 20k given them. way controls inflation Americans keep little purchasing power. like giving corporate bailout saying, wait rest america still poor can’t prices made price elasticity ultra sensitive. young people die getting potentially permanent organ even brain damage it. guy wanted nuke hurricane. Heard agreed. saying Holcomb irreprehensible saying surprised COVID response leadership. It’s worse teachers. choose job they’ll probably get infected quitting horrible job market. beyond infuriating, hate place. would UN ""stepping in"" look like, responses would current administration action full declarations war UN? They’re “looking like”, *are*. talk frat guys like that. Well... fuck.

The US completely fallen apart past months. Trust man. I’m small business owner myself. Would make feel better? understand you’re minority business realm. forgot Freedumz !!!!eleventy!!  Well that's going end well. Reality check, suck compared Western countries' response. whole US incompetently managing disease. needs law requiring hospitals document people turned away. surprise majority people turned away Black Hispanic. work public library. Everything I'm could done home, work circulation. answer emails, phone call two day, write research publication, etc. I'm butt seat whatever ""optics"" think projecting right now. Multiple staff gotten COVID. enough cover therapist PTSD.  agree inflated states like new york counted every death person tested positive covid death, regardless whether cause. Many states go remove cases count (or have) resources time. states hundred counts per day. shouldn’t shut down. Mask wearing contact tracing sufficient. get extra money setting broken leg someone covid. provide covid treatment get money. Don’t count chickens hatch.... remember Pfizer charging $1,000 box, ink box, plastic wrapping around free vaccine. going say, oh it’s old people, like old people deserve die something. Old people human rights, know, basic all, right LIVE country anymore? What’s happening here?! boat company trying hard get us back job fully remote. even rights sue though? Like case able WFH forced anyways? BNO News? avoid Townhall w. 25th like fckn plague final line is;

*Fuck you, I’ll again.* lies spouted pandemic white house, would pick CDC recommending masks early April one thing call out? (Discovery asymptomatic spread caused change recommendation.) got reddit googling random numbers followed ""new cases"" i.e. 2742 new cases. seems like whatever number put in, page reported number. Started 3 digit numbers moved up. Kinda weird. times like remind young people reddit can't even fathom widespread fraud industry even possible, despite exact kind behavior causing last recession 2008 housing securities. combat people say shit? Seeing family weekend need know. lost country literal cult literal death-worshippers. 

I speaking figuratively. Trust me, Georgian US. feel like shit everyday olimpics waste money city, case example condos already sold construct find another place athletes.  Imploding inside. guns protecting liberties, you’re taking streets them, you? many “liberties” completely trashed something done claim this? Maybe means Covid-19 Pandemic VIRUS minuscule. case, good job. really minuscule. gun toting folk Florida hell time shooting virus minuscule. Hey send ship NY ? land locked rivers ? 2 proud? get it. police already power. would different plane?

These people actively infecting killing people. stopped fast possible? allowed infect hundreds?

Why innocent people sit infected die rather remove people causing death destruction equation?

Are wearing mask cough? not, get ready flying lessons.

There nothing civilized letting barbarians run free law abiding citizens suffer recourse. Never heard maple syrup water coke...and im 43 fucking love pancakes That's time discormort masks. Whenever work heat mask breathing gets heavier. Granted I've never good heat. hired new campaign manager last week.  public shaming... society shies saying something people obviously violating orders/others rights/etc. Man need bring back booing ‘Murican Karen snowflakes applauding actually want end shit! literally said look up? 

Literally look BLM protests click videos. Tons motherfuckers without masks. fuckin silly guys think bunch mostly unorganized protesters actually keeping masks (tons people wearing masks background (again plenty people wearing (more people wearing masks/wearing incorrectly sides.)

All home grown videos people took YouTube took riots shit cause worry.


I'm cited anecdote show experience universal.

Also one yelling, text. Stop dramatic baby.

You refuse look facts. Lots others done it. AZ sheriff got Covid (Lamb). California Governor threatened cut funding enforce. Great, America may eventually dig shit, none us live see finally happens 2100. dad's already this... ""His friend works hospital told get federal aid covid"".  Everyone wearing mask Texas, Florida, Georgia: called alot parents saying want teach watch kids , hade problem leaving job ensure well 4 kids I'm ready homeschool well... CDC pretty much go white house trust anything. like leader someone elses pockets failed job. Maybe silver lining Democrats win landslide November? false numbers there’s really 2k? That’s point law. It’s easier retail workers say “It’s illegal” “It’s company policy”. true, us concerned much profit, staying around all. 

Trying balance risk still get everyone paid, ensuring future business pays well, benefits really tries take care employees. 

I’ll gladly break even, even sustain loss year two, operate capacity. dude. guy citing something actually happened (and certain political group supported) order make point. making *different* moral point that, agree with, nobody misunderstanding. 140k died Covid. 4 months. idiots like take either joke attack freedom. smarter even receptionist CDC. unable stay away people wearing mask simple sign human respect extremely low pathetic. People displaying complete lack logic shouldn’t part society. It’s one person, coming Chyyynaaaa.  states better others though, state taking patients AZ TX bc hospitals aren’t overwhelmed governor isn’t republican. irony due closure deaths car accidents similar causes down, makes background death rate look even worse. somehow people dropping dead homes for, uh, reason guess? KN95's available he's risk group. That's best bet. stacking disposable surgical masks increase effectiveness they're better cloth own. could mean doctor needs request ventilator required breathing.  think suicides shutdown-related deaths. There's getting them. Same! Southern Florida here. shall suffer incompetence DeSatan together. .5 9/11's week hm, wonder sars vaccine, could died could finished testing them? can't it, must different reason. maybe bc impossible make effective vaccine coronaviruses, yeah it, impossible make effective vaccine. nothing prove vaccines development time effective bc sars died out. /s

besides, still working vaccines mers covid came along. Minnesotan here, guarantee boss would never turn someone gonna business us, mask not. Multiple 140k 3 looking pretty similar numbers heart stroke. Read edit. also fuck off. don’t get sarcasm, don’t. oxygen levels affected masks, running wearing surgical mask make one feel breathless much faster? psychological? doctor lying? Closing three 9/11's per week.

Republicans handcuffed history. least got us back electing black man, right? sell sammich smells like bleach $1 turn around give cure 4million. Sid right? I'm agreeing adding personal belief context... I’m sure anymore.  

Kids haven’t affected much right virus clearly demonstrated higher viral loads = intense symptoms. brunt shit festival kids school mostly isolated.  

Now going put super concentrated virus center several hours day 5 days week. schools open back think might seeing kids affected ways didn’t think possible. people life actively denying numbers praising Trump. 

Why people like this? I’m dying send help. regular bloke cant go without gun

That's regular. never 58 years needed gun, know anyone carries one, live rural Texas, lived rough urban neighborhoods. sane person carries matter routine. Yes, people do, they're sane. They're dangerous idiots. Compliance man wake ""Historically, women under-researched, part fluctuations hormones—like estrogen progesterone—were thought skew results. that's exactly point, many researchers emphasize. Drugs may work differently different bodies. women experience hormonal changes different life stages, childbearing years menopause.""

Overall seems like clickbait article. course need representative participation vaccine trials! That's awesome. 💪💪💪 Nah, think don’t want start back pandemic going whole hog. Nobody cares fathers day... Like fried bologna sandwich card made morning remembered it. makes sad numb everyone going quarter million dead xmas

and every one suffered passed, least dozen suffer live lifelong chronic conditions  Yeah, it’s crazy leaders representing many Christians incapable caring unfortunate society. care protecting business interests (so money). don’t think true believers, use Bible fool people. 

 “As rich present age, charge haughty, set hopes uncertainty riches, God, richly provides us everything enjoy. good, rich good works, generous ready share, thus storing treasure good foundation future, may take hold truly life.” 1st Timothy 6:17-19

Oh! Almost forgot James 2:14-26
“What good it, brothers, someone says faith works? faith save him? brother sister poorly clothed lacking daily food, one says them, “Go peace, warmed filled,” without giving things needed body, good that? also faith itself, works, dead. someone say, “You faith works.” Show faith apart works, show faith works. ...“

Eta: clear anyone reading, I’m unemployment, working pandemic, atheist though appreciate Bible literature. That’s even real concern. real concern mingling children great way spread virus, office office B connected employees children class. need break 2+ hops chains connections. group people stay them, group monogamously stay group. Remind me! 3 weeks even know expect Feds do. little control states laws enforcement this.

The Feds done anyone, states still can't get unemployment systems working distribute + PUA.

Death rate ""skyrocketed"", plummeted last 3 months 50%. high death rate various states stupid shit nursing homes federal/CDC guidelines. Why? Earth flat, windmills cause cancer, vaccine bad, masks useless. Keep good work America. Jesus Christ remember arguments back April May people claiming everybody dying covid would died year anyway.

Just absolutely stunning ignorance. president helped heavily criticizing governor's acting responsibly implying governors sacrificing economy states ""get"" Trump. Rest peace Hey since pandemic started (let's say February moth us deaths didnt happen well after) 6 months. time, 150,000 people died covid USA still rising number people die every day also rising. Meanwhile 650,000 people die every year heart disease stroke. looking 325,000 6 month period (approximation). Covid far killed half many people heart stroke numbers continue climb climbing faster right now. 

This pandemic nearly bad worst killer Americans every year getting worse. can't see this?! That's good news. guess better protest upcoming lockdowns keep states open. quality PTSD therapy EXPENSIVE! Totally. concerned one group time.  Well, care election, armed federal agents army gear abducting agitators streets city reputation supporting current regime. think mean rich peoples accounts people looking would maybe stayed republican murder spree. could removed him, passed mask law, R governors could done star level. Automod ban me, isn’t trump crisis, it’s republican one. turns out, hundreds people time, outside, wearing masks mostly keeping hands really hold candle sheer scale millions individually choosing wear masks go bars restaurants parties generally interact much public spaces surfaces. hOsPiTaLs GeT mOnEy ClAsSiFyInG dEaThS cOvId

Yeah except hospitals *bleeding* money right now, want much anyone. far no, haven’t requirement gotta go gym morning way US’s daily deaths lessen population already dead. Oooh plus next week Barr well. Guess I’ll back watching CSPAN hours next week No. Vents beds running dire situation. even pay attention happened NYC? Well lot fat people habit eating large portions unhealthy foods. could expect take health seriously? I'm saving post. ever delete  took us 3 weeks get Baghdad.

The US military fighting guerilla fighters.

They'd take cities quickly it'd except small rural skirmishes, like battles US ""lost"" Vietnam Iraq.

If US military turned attention public it'd quick it'd silly. standard procedure closing secured facility. Statistically still low addition classifications issues work hospital finance. March April hit hard outpatient visits along ER visits dropped. many 50% infections normal seasonal flu may asymptomatic, may **part due pre-existing partial immunity**. Asymptomatic patients shed virus transmit disease, rate symptomatic individuals, creates invisible “reservoir” virus. [My Schools opening circumstances likely make worse, least would case. Living CT happy! They've moved pretending like problem.

they're trying divert people's attention pointing shooting Chicago, makes look silly comparing 14 people injured shooting 1,000 people dying pandemic everyday I'm trying say worried pandemic. 

It's full head sand mode theory Trump going get Mexico pay wall... guess valid point. Tomorrow “Mass graves make economic sense. Trump saving us money funeral costs” NJ one four decreasing states. Indoor dining gyms never opened. lockdown though slowly safely reopening. People good wearing masks I've seen. never saw single person inside store without mask, rarely go stores. Could?  /r/raisedbynarcissists incredible? took PPE sold friends, marked sold back states. often reseller tip feds sold PPE could grabbed again? What’s difference! 🤷‍♀️ nothing like Italy Iran nyc. never see again. Look data  saddest/funniest part expect modern infrastructure neglected underfunded health care system.

Who would though investing nation's health would important? RemindME! EOY “reply thread.” saying? They're idiots Gods ""It's two 9/11s week, worse alcohol"" believe that's case California. never fully opened. Germany full individualist selfish boomers  Oh wow, guess 4yo Stop, please stop, please love god! I'm **tired** WINNING can't believe people still think masks stupid hoax. believe death toll? Flu still killed 🤷🏼‍♀️ thought terrible messaging time. know trying avoid run masks, confused people never really come back it. Man, really REALLY hate concept people unemployed returning work they're making unemployment. heard single unemployed person say reason returning work. People returning work jobs either laid permanently, called back want risk life working public $10 hour part time somewhere.

On top that, people's bills accordance much money make. someone making 60k year lost job, state good benefits, that's knocked 30k. People can't take minimum wage job grocery store fast food place afford pay housing, cars, etc. That's huge loss income. top that, even get part time job, state, can't make $60 week start cutting unemployment benefit. working, risking health, still making enough money get close salary happened. 

Also someone suggests cutting expenses. car home, things can't get rid stop paying for. Even renting, moving cheaper apartment impossible unemployed. one wants rent anyone without steady income right now. feel like amts drg peanuts patient hospitalized while.

I’m also still opinion hospitals would rather volumes stay same. revenue broadcasting anyway? many tickets stadium accommodate. I'm US never seen lede today right here, assumed typo something. TIL'd guess. false. true, would mean diseases would always eclipse causes death.

However, true (and suspect people get confused) test positive, sick suddenly die something might might related (e.g. stroke) presumption *did* die due complications disease way parse true reliably listing deaths non-COVID would damaging solution terms losing track potentially important correlations.

The good news cases vanishingly small compared bulk COVID-19 deaths expect: respiratory issues leading usual complications, organ failure, etc.

The bad news ""have undoubtedly number deaths caused virus counted official tallies,"" according one paper. Indeed, larger issue consistently under- over-counting deaths.

Can add link pin top talking scenarios low risk high risk, recommended get tested seek care? people posting stressed corona exposure low person real reason nervous. 

I don’t want invalidate people feel anxious person prone nervous paranoia myself. understand need, really don’t think it’s healthy people constantly posting messages may get reasonable response saying “you probably fine” without pointing may little much worry perpetuates problem encourages people post something every time go outside. 

Getting people take disease seriously serious issue, possible take seriously. harms people’s mental health worry excessively, may encourage people get tested incredibly low chances exposure without symptoms exacerbates shortages testing doctor consults, reserved people either experiencing serious symptoms significant contact known positive case. 

I really think dedicated link help calm people clearly anxious. 

I think people also need information masks offer protection, explain masks primarily affect passing disease others (hence everyone needs wear one), necessarily something protects unless something N95. Many posts said (I passed somebody “x” wasn’t wearing mask think wearing mask time primary issue. Masks obviously give protection people, think lot people still don’t want understand masks going protect others others.

Sigh. explain damn time. can’t bother anymore love wearing mask like next person, whenever I'm physically exerting (especially hot/humid) weather, basically need take breather every minutes. inside mask gets wet disgusting :/ I’ve heard wondered truly semblance truth hospitals reporting higher covid related deaths getting money, grant money, state money federal. asking serious question try educate hear point brought up. totally agree blame hold dead. Actually realize operate independently. citation that?

Sinclair, well full agreement them. I’m Kansas Governor announced couple days ago issuing executive order postpone school openings Labor Day. Many schools start early mid August, 3 week delay average. idea give local school districts time plan prepare, getting social distancing set classrooms, getting PPE, figuring handle bussing, figuring they’re even going schooling overall, preparing online lessons kids remote learning, etc. get idea.

Then today state board education met vetoed executive order, saying districts make choice open. People commenting FB Governor control trying tell schools open Labor Day. she’s fit office. on.

The syrup regular drinks though?? Must newfie thing something.  HALF?!

That's huge. correct, COVID patients use shit-ton resources. Ventilators, PPE, extra staff, often require equipment CT scanners closed special cleaning. costs hospitals money. Oof. like good friend gives harsh criticism know it’s valid want mad like “dude it’s like that” instead nod die little bit inside know they’re right better. sad. 100% preventable. people love shit big corporations ones aiding abetting behaviors government picking winners. Can't use schools students going back weeks. 

All makes mad! frustrated. terribly, terribly sad! patient would need positive test covid chart well going say died it... Worse costs 30k keep prisoner underspending makes prisons hellholes  someone told recently, didn’t believe it, would get thought from? sure you’ve heard anything. record didn’t believe em, seemed sure want focus real issues, focus actual ones then. 

2/3 women 3/4 men U.S. low IQs choose obese ruin immune systems. 

Why fine individuals take freedom choice away seeing 50% Americans willingly give heart disease. 

Yet, focus harmless flu? Absolutely pathetic. 

But npc brain believe everything politicians media tell you, can’t really helped, you? Nah, talking someone whose head far ass, smell shit. done? it’s ‘lets increase child deaths opening schools!’ 

I really thought people would cross line put children danger. wrong apparently. Seems consensus data going White House instead CDC would lower case death data. happened claims? long positive test supposed isolate? Eventually students fought rule preventing RAs student EMTs calling ambulance drunk kids without consent bc it’s financially disastrous. allowed without consent unconscious.

what actual fuck wrong country, holy shit risking lives others comfort.

Society tolerating assholes trying ruin peoples lives selfish reasons cup tea. lose points make spelling certain words 'u'. Nobody pick them. one large BLM protests DC, masks almost universal. also norm battles cops, obvious reasons. Also, combination masked outdoors together really helps mitigate danger. unmasked outdoors, like yahoos Huntington Beach, dangerous frankly infuriating. heaviest spreading coming bars, restaurants, house parties, churches, etc. 

I'm Democrat, say neoliberal capitalist parties dishonest design. Ok get free magic happy pills too? state governors control it. keep hearing ""my uncle's brother's best friend even take test got positive result""

Initially let roll off, starting drive crazy. Seems like everyone know thinks know someone got suspicious false positive test. I'm at, lot stores already security standing near entry. mean keep working sick? working well USA... maximum could theoretically much higher based decisions made coming months number elected idiots. !RemindMe 21 days  near zero leadership federal level looks like. joke thats literally whats happening. People going around saying covid deaths inflated ploy democrats appose trump. hurt ""his"" economy ""success"" make look bad. parrot shit like ""a motorcyclist died accident tested positive marked covid death"". exact words trump loving people Alabama. fucking hate people around otherwise great place, goddamn backwards though. Also there's obsession George soros literally funding anything left anti trump reason antifa organizations exist. Also funded everything protest related last 4 years shit appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message*  it? told 4 races.  No, actual problem corona virus. came try making narrow exceptions US equal worse country world. 

China internment camps? American border detention centers.

Chinese secret police? Portland federal police.

North Korean starvation? American poverty food shortage funding terror cells. American intervention central south America.

You're blind belief American dream delusional makes part problem.

We suck. long time. people like want say ""oh about..."" letting get worse hope left life maybe someone somewhere worse without ever stopping think anything could improved. What, people Texas following health advice caring killing people aren’t themselves.. fake news. orange god speaks highly them.. cannot be. is. Take look excess death numbers See movie Contagion.

FFS America get act together Second wave BS... first never ended. reason went away start becase lockdown. mental age 2 exempt needing mask? 1. number flu deaths estimated based excess mortality. overestimating deaths flu, also overestimating deaths Covid excess mortality lines pretty well confirmed Covid deaths. 

2. start getting 0.1% IFR, run problems I’ve described before. simply doesn’t make sense many infections, least current understanding viruses spread. mean? Hospitals remained open? man. Also give people wrong idea. Georgian, super fucking jealous. need VPN access Reddit CCP allowing access now?

China league terms IP theft. steal IP good export respiratory seems quite delayed compared surge deaths March peaked 1-2 weeks surge cases peaked. That's thought many deaths linked distinct circumstances Northeast, opposed inherent nature disease. see live Kemp hell 

Did see two judges recused one? Lol. know career ending side Kemp think CDC states' individual reporting always align. RemindMe! 30 days done since then? Zero ramp push DPA make ppe. fucking joke. Cloth masks, shirts, bandanas, lmao. someone cared dying? Hahahahaha great comparison. decrease medical errors? know, answer definitely complicated ""put mask on"". doesn’t believe that. neither hoax-loving constituents. always point out, all-cause mortality like 20% compared previous years. Sure, attributed things like people delaying medical care, certainly 20%. government going around poisoning hundreds thousands people ""inflate numbers?"" scary. one sanitizers list bought grocery store using it, thankfully bought new one recently target that’s made US, threw mine away. economy back yet? Hmm... wonder Chinese consulate Houston shut ...? Houston largest health complex world ? say hospital makes thin air. Please strawman I'm saying.

If patient cough, could feasibly diagnose patient covid (especially beginning pandemic testing short supply).

If patient got motorcycle accident, also tests positive covid, they're covid patient.

Hospitals profit businesses, things happening (example #1 #2). lot easier hospital get away commit insurance fraud. Hmmmmm Roomie valley situation fucking desperate heartbreaking. Hospitals overloaded weeks. whiter area i'm sure national media would it. Abbot denied filed hospitals, too, absolute scum. Well fuck  Second wave way. Historically much worse first. God also scientist. heartbreaking absolutely Correct, indeed snakes and/or shit realize conspiritard kid him? Sucks linked moron forever. Finns going Sweden buy snuff beer midst pandemic, worry too. worry Sweden, really must hard conspiracy theorist. Constantly convinced world get you. matter do, someone always you. stress levels must insane! I'm sure every area different area many employers looking workers right now. hard time finding workers due unemployment bonus.

These similarly skilled workers refusing work similarly paying jobs. Food service workers work refusing work grocery store. distribution plant normally pays food service industry can't get employees pay less current unemployment benefits. Like many said...this getting ugly....fast. Lol awesome contradict says March 8th. Ok. say “the news fault reporting story” “the news reporting story”?

Again, can’t strong readers, harm mistakes. decedents 

Descendents. Decedents died. Yeah don’t get “only” part. answer Yes. Yes, get Covid again. matter unlikely. Yeah unfortunately seems people read headlines ""antibodies disappear within weeks"" articles read investigate further.  quit eligible genius book ""The Coming Plague"" Laurie Garrett section pursued last cases smallpox wild globe. gripping thriller close run thing end, too. Winter Coming people would wear masks! virus shed someone catching ride larger bodily fluid particles. wearing mask catch large particles easily. particles caught source control mask two things happen. First, droplets someone else end mask touching/adjusting mask help find way in. Second, fluids around particles evaporate air become smaller, making likely pass mask. y’all aren’t even worth cost device anyway! thought virus mostly attacked stupid conservatives... else Bill Gates supposed update tracker Covid-20?

/s allow condition couple never divorce. See still want marriage ceremony badly. Even could, nothing hard fast biology. reports contradict this.... fact reports read suggest opposite That’s major self-ownage don’t realize it.

Sex condom zero-risk. Abstinence zero-risk. know public health scientists abandoned abstinence decades ago? learned tell public “the thing want unsafe matter what,” they’ll anyway take safety precautions. tell activities safer manner reasonable precautions (like wearing condoms , like things outdoors, masks, reduced capacity needed maintain distancing) get better compliance better health outcomes.


I’m guy advocating COVID equivalent condoms. You’re guy trying push abstinence-only education wondering teenagers get pregnant anyway. guy keep getting free passes? literally caught camera looting let go wink nod....

Also little bit freaky good predicted terms origin, time, kind virus etc. death rate much high predicted (but better prepare worst) seriously recommend hypnosis (from licensed hypnotherapist). article downvoted obscurity. using excuse.

1 it’s true.

2 don’t care everyone knows it’s true.

3 still gonna say excuse true.

4 bust one still another one.

No sane person actually believe healthy person would harmed wearing mask... doctors would sick... two weeks

Reminder several states close down;

And, states spiking right now, did, many ways barely closed down.  We've one recess yes, second recess?! certainly didn’t help. click link posted above, quoting interview Fauci gave June 12, 3 months one mentioned So, told wear masks ""Well, reason concerned public health community, many people saying this, concerned time personal protective equipment, including N95 masks surgical masks, short supply. wanted make sure people namely, health care workers, brave enough put harm way, take care people know infected coronavirus danger getting infected."" think believe numbers.

I've boss like that. Unsurprisingly, company went belly up. one seen coming (well, sycophants). headline wrong? potential causes

Maybe god doesn’t like New Yorkers? 🤷‍♀️ 30's best bro c'mon Yup. I've people tell turn location tracking. Yeah, gonna make serious threats powerful, well known people let know turning tracking worked ... office got ton masks bureau workers comp couple weeks ago news fault reporting story, I'm terribly sorry choice photo suit taste. They're reporting hotbed anti mask super spreaders pandemic, well should. One huge difference: plague bacterial, CoVid viral. two different beasts fight against. 
Can’t really make comparison feel better it. someone banned particular sub engaging civil discussion favor masks, bathed downvotes, no.. no, hear others there. may contagious, decisions impact likelihood getting like communicable disease bad luck those. pods kept leaking mouth, switched back Juul. get bad batch pods? doubt peak.

Honestly man wouldn’t bet thing showing wildlife bats etc US. need theory one Virus infect one Cell. Seriously... phrasing anymore? Nono didnt went hard anything, wanted apologize disrespectful shit. NY testing cases (for now). Like said, data overlaps. person brain set eyeballs can’t honestly deny protesting good controlling spread virus. 100% agree, probably removed. Hell, brand recognition would wonders. this, would remember Pfizer Viagra company, I'm sure people would, too. many local sheriffs redneck counties refusing enforce statewide mask orders California already. 🤦‍♀️ ""No,"" says America. like Erie county (thats am), Im guessing youre increase cases 20-29 age group, less likely hospitalized die makes sense numbers Yea . thought caregiver door answered. Stupid I'm going preface saying son's annual summer camp cancelled year would even considered sending even wasn't. 

That said, son disabled typically goes week long camp every summer kids situation. Many kids attend look forward week entire rest year many one sole places make friends social connections. everyone sends kids camp fuck around get drunk yard. What's model used expected line?  Places absolutely shut down. Indoor dining, bars/clubs/distilleries, indoor museums, indoor sections zoo, card rooms, salons/barbershops, indoor fitness facilities, indoor malls (unless entrance outside), etc. businesses allowed operate outside possible. 

So *all* non-essential businesses, deemed highest risk/most unnecessary apparently. Whether businesses actually listening shutdown order another problem I'm sure exactly address compliance issues. live Indiana primarily lean Democratic, I've pleasantly surprised reasonable Holcomb this. huge factor cases California right significantly younger. forget stats infected much younger overall seen New York, also many nursing hone deaths. Infections California become heavily skewed towards younger people, likely survive eradicate small pox, could eradicate Covid. found true based science? feeling? think he's talking particularly Oxford vaccine, development 5 years already worries, know easy discussions get heated Reddit. agree you, I'm sure way accommodate legitimate anxiety medical conditions still keep safe. face shields it, I'm it. Hope good one. Call corporate offices complain it. 

Home Depot supposed start requiring masks customers today. ""Effective Wednesday July 22, customers required wear masks stores."" go local HD today signs entrance masks several customers masks on. called customer service/experience hotline complained it. *said* would open case regional manager regional manager would pass customer care report local manager. 

For Home Depot: 1-800-466-3337 Wait # option report negative store experience. took 4 minutes call start finish. 'Rad Trad' Catholic Bishops second Airline Execs bad covid actors.

Polio's gone Nigeria years far know (which great broke years ago got loose African nations took sometime bottle far know clear continent again. Afghanistan Pakistan go now.

http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/polio-now/this-week/ open borders really matter infection rates roughly same? borders open everyone selected countries relatively well right now. trust countries test report numbers properly, think worse say travelling train plane inside one country. 

On individual level course better avoid travel unless necessary. country important infections remain manageable containable. there's risk running control, I'm sure stricter travel restrictions one first things enforced again. Yeah need new government. really think second attempt lockdown. can't imagine economy populace could take it. possible rump changed tune told uncertain terms that: A. zero chance reelection without taking seriously and/or B. another lockdown people get serious thus eliminating chance reelection. Since cares else, guess that's motivated attempt serious (way little way late).

I really hope bend curve without resort another lockdown attempt. 

If anti-mask crowd really wants avoid repeat performance, need get religious wearing mask. mean Portland trial nationwide testing.... can't test can't find people 👍

Big brain thinking... Chicago next! That's like 0.1% ish death rate. mostly old people die according nurse talked yesterday.

Edit: death rate start fight club I’m UK - way close full NZ-style lockdown, let alone Italy NZ-style lockdown (if I’m understanding Kiwi friends right). People neighbourhood flagrantly disobeying rules right left. Even we’ve implemented mandated mask wearing transport ONE still wearing masks, went actual non-grocery shopping yesterday Brick Lane, confirm. second wave hit us time sneeze. Someone correct I’m wrong think states mail-in ballots available likely go back 1,000 next Tuesday, numbers fit trend. 

Deaths going up, last Thursday Friday 900. Saturday 800, Sunday-Monday 400-500+. highly doubt evidence upcoming numbers better. god.

how tick page boxes whether tried catch spread it?! wear mask? go home. 

attended rally? go home. 

carried sign needed haircut yelled unmasked face crowd? fuck go home

sat truck yelling health care workers? double fuck go home

then maybe one poor souls ""poor survival chances"" (you know - war vets spouses) probably gave virus ICU bed ventilator. Agreed. importance Christian Drosten vastly underestimated, especially thread. Sadly knowledge nothing nobody listens him. !remind 2 weeks problem (for reason) actually people believe that, making hard detect sarcssm text said. region 15 confirmed cases. 15 confirmed cases 1,5 months ago too. cases arose already lockdown. telling work. bit ironic, feel. so, would highly illegal newsworthy.

Barely newsworthy. hospitals America deliver good healthcare indigent patients. same.

Illegal, is. 

But America stopped enforcing laws powerful long time ago. 

For example, consider [Libby Zion restricts medical residents NY 80 hours work week - is, 11 hours day - _24 hours_ work row.

24 hours work row! good would decision making 24 hours continuous work?

You would think New York's hospitals would follow law - consider reasonable. thought that, would wrong. cannot answer question. try deviate conversation become personal. Pathetic. Well fair There’s police officers every race. Starr County Memorial Hospital, hospital county, make end-of-life decisions residents following social distancing guidelines, Starr County Judge Eloy Vera said, adding, ""Our backs wall."" burner phones call forwarding services come in. get new sim every weeks, sim tracking bunk. that's ignoring Faraday pouches. strange, strangely aggro, response.

Yes, that's thought reading *your* response. said American assume, issues conservative ideals politicians comparing entire countries cultural attitudes south US insult. Talking one multicultural places earth best standards living earth also. what’s fucking vaccine then? Honestly though sentiment depressing. People giving theres plan horizon look to. Wear mask social distance, that's it. That's go on. We're pushed back mines face starvation homelessness, things loved doing, movies, concerts, social outings gone foreseeable future. everyday something worse ontop all. Nobody knows deal turn to. There's leadership, guidance. Grief, we're experiencing hard heavy load grief end sight. know 1890's kid when...  Aussie Melbournian here. state Victoria second wave right from. 486 new cases yesterday 403 today. started basically one hotel quarantine went wrong one family follow restrictions. mandatory masks back lockdown. Controlled re-opening affect much, every restaurant gym severely limited numbers sign name number contact tracing. Majority spread work dickheads following directives restrictions. Teenagers young adults *terrible* recognizing consequences. result stupid, way human brains develop recognize risk vs reward. That's *normal* circumstances, whatever fuck 2020 is. Given trauma also major impact risk vs reward perception, absolutely surprised people make kinds decisions.

We hold people accountable, even young people, still recognizing perfect storm make choices appear callous illogical. expect even know many cases. 

(Note: Parental brainwashing also plays role here. Adolescents primed rebel, things get super fucked traumatically quarantined parents they're saying things make feel safer.) Only? sounds like lot.

Thanks stats moose front told you. guess feel lucky job all. 

I get coming from, health safety mental health important feelings valid. need discount qualify them. someone lost good job whole thing, best wishes sympathies; sounds like frightening situation hope things start looking area. Would logical. exhale, also lose lot water body. Afaik, even largest water drainage have. mask front face, humidity cannot instantly leave, accumulates mask. Everyone wearing glasses see easily entering buildings warmer outside mask on. 

The difference may mask lets humidity pass easily. would bad. automatically breathe mouth get feeling can't get enough air nose. 
My nose example pretty bad comes breathing kind physical activity. anatomical thing. use tell ppl ""i thing hold glasses"" heard lying numbers, wanted hear take Cool, thanks! Difficult see number people died listening Boris congratulating government outstanding response global leadership UK medecine, governance ... everything.

When British people going wake realize UK dot map... glory days empire finished generations ago. wow... hate this. here’s upvote. tell people aisle take mask going get comfortable also strip banana hammock. 

Our friend pilot started getting symptoms flying copilot Covid cough told bronchitis even though tested. Much people country either ignorant, dumb selfish, can't get act together comes solving big universal challenges. simple task wearing mask public months could cure cancer would nice chunk population saying ""totally worth it"" Came back work stint due covid test came back negative. Boss first thing asked cited tik tok source motorcyclist died wreck covid counted covid death. People stupid. Free haircuts too!! *Charge em tests, extra expedite*

*Excess death relabeled delayed onset pneumonia*

*Fudge numbers here, round there*

Also, can't get cancer heart disease talking someone.... please give idea.  misunderstand, guy replying shifted goal posts 'some exceptions leaving'. know Europe therefore don’t exist, encountered lot US friends circles... it’s education media issue point self centeredness guess READ.THE.FUCKING.ARTICLES.NOT.JUST.THE.HEADLINES. Yeah let’s fire cops. Great idea really. take genius figure forced break ratrace modern life good unborn child. Less pollution, physical rest, less stress hormones blood provided employer ass adequately mentally cope COVID restrictions. America shitshow point.... guys actually believe numbers? find reportings highly suspect see articles directly call data collection question. Multiple labs Florida posting false positive rates, motorcycle crashes labeled “covid” death. I’m sure I’m going get downvoted here, needs uninterested third parties validating numbers. think least 30% cases, covid primary cause death Lmao changed? president?  :/ Much Europe, Peru Chile higher deaths per capita US. Brazil's actually lower, bet catch us soon.  I've asking people, 5g big deal - happens get 6g? Joke is, possible big pandemics avoided government prepared everyone played part. think everyone remember death toll passes 1 million, could avoided. Catholics real Christians though according lot Americans. People obese want die lose weight become healthy, people covid-19 can't. need treatment. 

We society need focus covid-19 obesity, one problems solved alone needs whole village.

After covid-19 longer problem I'm helping obese people get healthy. untill shove it. People downvoting person sympathizing girl made mistake and, result, getting icu live guilt killing one grandparent maiming another. think ok acknowledge people fighting coronavirus precautions ignorant often vile, many us probably made bigger mistakes never suffer consequences like that. bad time irresponsible. gods you’re dumb fuck. Look many people die every day. Woohoo get stay home. another 4 months.... possibly much, much longer..... bit... Sleep well friend Go Big Gretch! 105 days vape-free here! proud everyone! make minds up. 2 masks painting cars. Worst case, going wear one them. USA! USA! USA! Oh that's embarrassing Nursing home employee. state provided strict rules dealing COVID. Nursing home patients legal homes. separate wards COVID patients. reason COVID bad employees would get sick come work symptoms mild. Ask nursing home employee agree Science actually advanced enough place something skin needles. Conspiracy theorist took story ran it.

“A group Massachusetts Institute Technology researchers developed novel way address problem: embedding record directly skin.
Along vaccine, child would injected bit dye invisible naked eye easily seen special cell-phone filter, combined app shines near-infrared light onto skin.” 

And Bill took fall foundation one pay research. tracking chip, it’s small tattoo (that conspiracy peeps also like call ‘Mark Beast’) injected skin along vaccine way show records received what. 

That craziness started turned ‘tHeY R tRaCKinG nEedleS’

 [MIT engineers develop way store vaccine info skin Yes. PA here. concerned schools opening long test result wait time. student's Mom Dad waiting test, really thing going keep kids school get confirmation? Probably not. 12 days exposure everyone building. really shorter test window open things up. Yes sir... August 3rd. Going Home Depot put mask captains place. People need stand together protect employees protecting us says zero evidence ""What trying tell me? build wall?""

""No, Donald. I'm trying tell ready, to."" Sorry, much data says otherwise. You’re keeping Wow. painful watch. terrible idea people think German sound like - putting gurgling sounds together shout bark, mixed 1-2 mispronounced, also wrongly used, actual German words...sigh. You’re probably correct regard tend think that’s relatively pretty small percentage people. heard exact thing mother, lives Arizona. can't understand thought process. ridiculous. There's also fact pandemic causes deaths disease alone.

Not sure situation like US lot non urgent care delayed here. Treatments screenings diseases way there's massive amounts cancer, heart disease etc going undiagnosed untreated.

The overall death toll pandemic lot higher deaths caused directly virus. We're probably going still seeing effects pandemic years come even wipe covid-19 early next year. question starts ""Why America just..."" answered ""money"" and/or ""bigotry"". Natural selection finest. wear damn mask boi Perfect match riots protests. 7-14 days spreading, 7-14 days incubation severe health effects usually death within 7-10 days that. Keep mind things like traffic accidents way *takez conspiracy Fedora*

oh turn tables Yes number decreasing. new cases least past couple days. *course* denying it. /s lot* Americans. Easy broad generalizations there. isn’t Thunderdome, yet. Yes, last two days actually index case discover day before, two yesterday along 12 asymptomatic carriers.

Dat testing speed tho. PCR testing capacity pooling giving China crazy amount capacity, Urumqi 600,000 day city less 4 million people. spring warmer usual Go Murica it! dont think stop get billions!!!! Who's me? Weird, that's rest World thinks US. couples never allowed break move lives? man continue house woman forever even live seperate lives? strange world live That's silly saying mask government control you

There's denying uncomfortable wear mask. mean wear them. things true big hospital ship sent NY? thing find comforting cdc announced expect least 10x infections havnt reported. 

Were 15m reported cases world wide 620,000 deaths

That's 4% death rate

But multiply 15million x 10 .4% deaths world wide.

This pass eventually. Stay safe everyone. God damnit literally guy tell yesterday. ""They coding covid deaths dying things. know fact that's happening."" guns functional shoes can't wear. difficult explain away, made pretty clear chart thumbnail. big part problem OP thread saying 'anyone believes rise testing related rise cases idiot.' testing inherently cause rise numbers, axiomatic, dismissing anyone considered nuances exact arguments cause division stubbornness. obviously simple concept display comprehend, told reason dont agree something toothless illiterate might hesitant change mind well. neither. I'd whole lot worse/more degrading stuff lot less money. Defunded.

/s wouldn’t put much past tories, come on. love pets = personal item pay 180-250$ round trip them. flown kitty too. 

Quick take money protect way. Status quo. positive PCR *doesn't* mean contagious. depends viral load have, whether shedding *active* viral particles. PCR can't determine last part. Unfortunately sizeable minority country gone insane political system completely insane deal it. founding fathers created system government take account properly.  Inflated numbers. 

It's lie. ***knew*** keep fear going elections. let slide BLM protests. suddenly massive issue again.

Clever fucking virus tell happening streets. guys fucking playing fear. really bad there? Indiana resident comment let guys know stupid citizens here. ton people social media refusing wear masks still. ""I'm gonna fine care right"" 

Honestly makes fucking sick. wear fucking mask already United States laughing stock anymore. Plus I'm real tired getting sick again. (Don't take medical advice reddit) 

But sounds like possible zinc deficiency, obviously even us without COVID normal rituals/eating habits affected. always red meat 2-3 days week type guy cut back recently experienced type symptoms.  depends live. used live rural Wisconsin, shortly concealed carry came sitting bar talking one neighbors. complaining unfair sign door saying establishment prohibited guns, especially since law concealed carry apply drinking (you're supposed drink carry). twenty minutes listening he's downing Miller Lite, like ""But come though, know carrying right sign anything."" immediately like ""Well going anybody good car!""

So yeah. folks exactly think way do. dangerous place ever lived, super glad escaped. yep, day passed way recover. lack Federal leadership guidelines 100% responsibility US now. Although I've verified works there, think performs administrative functions works home remotely.  look info think ""why big deal almost 8k people die things day?"" problem comes hospitals related infrastructure arent built handle kind surge. ICUs example given day two thirds full average IIRC (citation needed) , ICUs filled additional people getting sick makes likely people die directly COVID-19 indirectly cases due lack access proper care. 

Yup. netherlands peak april/may ICUs overrun (1100 beds normally, 1500+ cases peak), caused massive pressure regular care hospitals. much hospitals shut regular care unless emergency. 

This hidden problem *all* people lot get: might get severe symptoms go ICU COVID people might think ""what's bad?"". break leg go hospital reason COVID, chances getting care need. 

*That's* people wear masks, stay home, keep distance wash hands. 

Thanks info, hopefully people see :)  guess it’s time save big money Menards. people ask example real life natural selection, relay story. Oh dear, here. Keep up. Take walk. Maybe meditate. Call hot line must didn’t choice, Texas, Florida, Arizona would closed non-essential businesses returned stay home orders now. states blue leadership like California return lockdown status. ugh sorry! mean time need money most! One hotel booking sites used one hotel went bankrupt cried 5 minutes one. Ironic part name Cancelon.  Yes. I’ve heard one *dozens* times. It’s right wing copypasta now. strange, strangely aggro, response.

I wondering person since missed-up situation in. attack it. Lots great answers thank everyone! TIL touch outside mask. Nope, filter air breathe harmful stuff.

Most inhaled filtered fibers. Better filters filter nasty stuff.

The hospital masks 3x effective versus homemade cloth masks according study looked time ago.

They good also weakened immune system contagious disease. 


If want buy air purifier, buy one u / v option powerful enough kill viruses bacteria hepa filter it. Thanks US. Masks weaken yer munity, touch yer mask scratch yer nose gets Covid, den think yer protecting peepoles wit yer mask, Covid flies right threw it, like there's nothin dere. everyon dun gots Covid.

Ifin jest livid yer life, yood still yer freedumbs everyone except old sick people wood still alive.

Der fake flu nuttin, took er jerbs!


/s focus send federal officers Chicago political stunt. Vermont entered chat. averaging 5 cases day, best testing numbers deaths month. stretches days without single covid patient hospital state wide. 

 North East right behind us level soon. (Adjusted proportionally population)

 taken us 4 months crawl point. Everyone took hit somehow. really saw amazing community togetherness make sure needs met. dreading ski season. tourist economy. would guess 80% tourist dollars spent 4 months Winter. We're committed state opening mountains year. 

 restrict North East already restricted even make sense. devastated appetite going Florida. Highest daily count since May 29 count hasnt ended. Essentially 2 months thrown garbage, good job America Weird. 

I picked smoking around march even playing game bro. Stay lane grunt job. he's technical job security skill... like route better. Healthcare workers help strain caused get sick highest risk mortality. that, lottery. .......


Here take upvote.... watched footage news networks scary ""some even wearing masks"" voiceovers front video every single protestor group filming wearing mask. think going win argument YELLING LOUDER LOUDER. Who's gonna roam around mask-free 'it's unlikely'. fellow PA citizen, heartily agree.  Whatever, hate Japanese Africans? else hate? Let hate consume you!!!!! Good. bullshit. best one heard sister law’s friends Fox-ers; waited line testing, took long left... guess what... sent us positive results even though never took test. 

Riiiiiiiiiight. maybe.....because America, Australian video. working hard hardly workin’? Merkel nothing, usually does. waited governors states endorsed public reaction positive, ones acted.

Doing nothing course much better actively helping spread, Trump does. idolization Merkel international media merit.

And ordinary Germans, see much deserves praise there, either. Nobody work wears mask. People still run other's offices good reason. Office doors kept open. Many people public transport wear mask chin. Even many cashiers grocery stores wear mask. rules, rules laws enforced many years now.

So kind odd numbers good. suspect mostly culture. We're less social people, talk less, hug less, many large families multi-generational households. People naturally keep distance. Lmfao 

Do understand biology works? Children human beings, pass germs. Ask teacher parent school age children many bugs get school starts. know, bc parent, many teacher friends.

They closed 6 week summer camp bc 1 person spread 80 people, campers.

There 400 cases babies 1 state contracting coronavirus well. willfully ignorant hate kids much extra effort worth risking peoples lives bc can't handle it? Australian video nothing united states, ya dingus. I’m okay that. worked ducking asses off. It’s not. Velocity much lower now. death numbers doubling every 4-5 days NYC. agrees well Yes no. masks reduce oxygen intake considerably. Like garbage bag example. YES that's thinking of, thank you! said virus can't eradicated stage. plan suppression would surely fail. put dot ""com"" like this: 

then hit enter, it'll remove paywalls. possible crime. Report it. don’t understand argument flu still sucks even don’t die it. People get shots don’t feel miserable flu. Nobody ever said “Wow you’re tough cool” somebody indifferent flu. fault acting retarded...

No, says: researchers found, ""Unvaccinated children tended white, mother married college degree, [and] live household annual income exceeding 75,000 agree haven’t even seen anything shows anti-vaxxers indeed less likely get vaccines first place.

Most anti-vaxxers already vaccinated; they're *kids* getting benefits. I'd imagine right its, small world Disney, buuutttttt.... make like shrek, little puppet things catch fire blow shows worthless bosses are. People know job especially highly technical. Texas broke 200 according Worldometers. Yes, died, so? relate question calculating estimated infection rates? Covid likes comment 500 per day 6.8k Peru deaths counted, it'll 7k. That's world deaths we've since April. Maybe measles? That’s definitely started re-emerge antivaxers. go subs anti mask like you, course hear question masks.

I always try check now, live life constantly worrying pre programmed responses situations selfish? wrong? Americans wearing mask understand, idiots, understand. 

They told built whole self bullshit, lies deception America filled with. get exposed lose shit. Like Target bucket rack lady, number unexplainable human responses realise America. America sick. Ok cure exists.

You implying cure COVID19? big assumption, could easily 3 years get ""cure"". thats going bite ass one day

Feel like America going backwards cases slightly dipping trending downward high 10,000+ cases days ago

It look way [on official Texas There's always dip cases reported two weekend days, numbers week hair last week. Texas's [daily test fairly spiky, they're testing dip week last week record high tests done. positive rate looks last week, they'd quite cases ran number tests last week. ""Winning"" always hear trump talk about? 

Here Scotland took seriously virus daily confirmed numbers almost single figures. making feel old. remember M.A.S.H, long time ago. Similarly, met Swede 2018. 


Therefore, Sweden began exist two years ago. QED. probably even higher excess deaths amount distancing people suppressing usual sources deaths.

People spreading kind disinformation incredibly dangerous they're contributing problem. 5,228 active cases left Canada.. it’s good number since 37 000 000.. course it’s reason “take easy.” I’m glad mask mandatory Quebec, see people wearing everywhere even outside walk can’t wait see numbers two weeks look like.

I'd support official ""Certified Shitless"" designation. absolute absence shit impossible, maybe percentages. controversial - known decades applies majority immune responses base analysis science data. Historically fastest vaccine ever created took 4 years (also RNA virus, one around studied years pre-vaccine). virus novel, 4 years may premature estimate, technology certainly better possible... Still would fathom something quicker, since MERS SARS vaccines never came fruition benefit recent tech.

You base based hopes dreams, lie vaccine around corner. Nope, soon saw OP post YouTubers massive party, knew bellends. 

The replies confirm though. That's really great news. 

ALL schools going fully remote tagged GOOD NEWS.

This undoubtedly, objectively, without argument save lives! ""Hope see side!""

Amazing. That's good idea. can't self isolate, people put quarantine. Countries putting eggs one basket, there's chance vaccine work desired outcome. 

I believe US funding least six different vaccines putting orders others. Oh God. can't even. 30 times bad would mean 1 100 Americans would already dead. 100 times would mean 1 30 already dead - would 14 million us. 

The death count certainly higher is, multiplier somewhere 1 2. We’ll know time goes paperwork in, compare mortality figures past mortality figures, factor fewer MVA fatalities etc, math. won’t precise absolute perfection, give pretty damned clear picture. you’re saying deadly, also zero social skills? COVID worst. I’ve always scratching head people expecting hospitals struggle greatly flu addition covid fall/winter. article lists lots reasons it’s unsurprising flu quiet year (less nonexistent trans-hemisphere travel, masks, people mindful hygiene, school event closures, social distancing, more). know covid contagious flu lower population immunity levels flu places.

Another one don’t think mentioned could significant though people experiencing covid-like illness quarantining either choice legal mandate. Flu sometimes spread 24 hours people become symptomatic, flu season need sick people interacting others since generally sicker feel flu higher fever contagious theory northern hemisphere spared rough flu season year, especially tough one next year. Why? light flu season leaves population immunologically vulnerable next one reasonable bet many countries vaccinated many citizens covid. vaccinated people eager travel interact post-covid world, inadvertently spreading flu. ERROR: Assignment operator cannot used comparison. Use equality operator == statistics standpoint, downside slope equal upside (standard distribution/bell curve) therefore arent even peak yet (still going up) thing going last minimun 2023 Though thinking height peak directly correlates intensity wave also stupid. right is, look US whole, bad first peak. want rough approximation death curve develop look positivity rate time: important say peak means people die first peak, it’s higher, idiots use „proof“ isn’t bad afterwards. kids young adults bad judgement though. I'd love detailed study parents party kids. suspect surprised findings. Almost seems working lot earlier considering COVID timeline.. employees force attend.. ARTICLE: 

Tighter borders quarantine curbs amid fresh wave Covid-19 cases Australia raised fears mangoes, citrus fruit, vegetables produce could left rot lack seasonal workers.

Australia month capped the number people enter country, ease pressure mandatory hotel quarantine program, second wave cases in Melbourne sparked fears outbreaks cities. New South Wales introduced stricter rules workers crossing Victoria, raising concerns labor shortages key growing area spanning border.


Seasonal workers would subject two-week quarantine wanted cross border, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said press conference Wednesday, state seeks curb recent virus clusters. “Anything high risk needs curtailed,” said.

Such rules mean ripe produce left rot, Citrus Australia chief executive Nathan Hancock said statement, calling greater clarity surrounding measures. “There justification ban seasonal workers pose greater threat anyone else working agriculture.”

In Northern Territory, mango harvest start mid-August industry expecting worker shortfall 1,500, said Tyson Cattle, spokesman industry group AUSVEG. September, labor needed along east coast wide range vegetables berries come season.
The labor situation expected worsen late 2020 2021 national borders remain largely closed temporary workers gradually return home countries, said. industry working governments incentivize workers stay lure Australian workers sector, added.
The federal government talks states territories have seasonal workers coming country exempt cap international arrival numbers, improve workforce mobility across internal borders, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said ABC Radio Tuesday.
The government already allowed seasonal workers Pacific Island workers employed country extend visas year ease labor shortages, said. local county supports state mandate, local sheriffs refuse enforce. Dumb fucks wrong side history. job assholes 🖕😷🖕 Definitely that's availability heuristics speculation point. know protective correlate disease. antibodies? T-cells? Memory B-cells? Nothing known right now. detect kinds cells antibodies patient. Without knowing confers immunity, speculation. 

Coronaviruses OC43 HKU1 give immunity all. situation SARS1 MERS unknown, nobody exposed twice. one behave? Time tell, stop confusing people. people operate misconception ""having meetings"" thing ""working."" somehow equally essential. That’s simply true. flu average kills 50,000 year. IFR .02%, 250 million people would get every year US alone. Since we’re average 100 million vaccinations year, would mean people unvaccinated contracted flu. 

Stop spreading misinformation idea you’re talking about. flu averaged .09%-.17% IFR since 2010. information easily available quick google search. 

 didn’t vaccinate elderly immuno-compromised, would much higher. flu serious. OP title fatality rate potentially 6 times deadlier flu...AND infection rate 2.6%. read article also discusses infection tests antibody tests. 

You posted don’t know many posts grand total zero references demanding references(which immediately provided), criticizing resources(Johns Hopkins).

I agree large segment (R) make Covid deniers. doubt.

But Trump historic lows means huge segment (R) well. 

We need allies this. political element it, it’s purely political.  none effective enough make much difference all? mean 2020, can't seem catch break. Wearing khakis also isn’t good controlling spread virus. neutral. isn’t useful way talking this. Especially tangents talking protests spikes. 

Before connecting protests spikes, need empirical data. uninterested empirical evidence, presenting opinions tentatively.

You fair hypothesis. science, test hypotheses. I'd like think they're peak, I'm sure absolute numbers good measure. released PP? concern states look like they're flattening testing capacity. Arizona probably worst example this. look like they're heading really positive direction look new cases, testing fallen cliff PP way high. said masks help? remember Fauci saying ""there need wear masks right now"" something alone lines. someone explain Sweden appears achieving herd immunity 10% infected? seems like world, places hit hard many cases. Also states hot weather Posters sub declaratively say get reinfected shambles rn. want hear, probably, *found about* broken ribs pain flared year accident caused them.

I might re-injured myself, though. allowed sun, fact safer outside, masking's deleterious effect triggers fragile right wing lunatics. stayed outside masked severe measures would largely unnecessary. Couple best healthcare world definitely charge people tens thousands dollars Covid treatment turn Covid patients away die, U.S. nothing WINNING ahead. South Korea even exist back then.  scientific study, please let know. 50 minutes listen conspiracy theorist provide anecdotal evidence incredibly rare occurrence. want look numbers, read methods, understand analysis, etc. average it, 146 days. Reformed hoosier begging reconsider. go.

I wish would shut bit. feels incredibly unsafe going work, customers idiots even couple coworkers COVID deniers don’t wear masks properly despite talked it. that’s even mention customers. already got sick cold since coming back work last month (and 3 weeks right quarantined awaiting test results.) 

If contract cold work, that’s literally place go (I order groceries delivered disinfect come inside, don’t even go grocery stores, always wear mask work wash hands disinfect religiously), Covid considerably contagious? Nothing post addresses anything valid. Remember best known model predicting 80k August? 😅 got “no brains” part stopped smoking cigarettes started smoking weed, lol.

Herp derp. Honestly don’t know that. agreeing person saying they’d rather Trump right thing wrong reasons all. even know impact fertility deaths finally catching Plus round $20. years come new people need vaccinated. 

Just keep generation alive children also get vaccinations. doctor CNN last night cabin friends 24 hour period. 8/11 people positive visited stayed exclusively outside wore masks. 

I can’t find article I’ll post it. Same. pretty measured response, especially far right Trumpy lot state is. Honestly, I’m depressed don’t know anymore. Actually ..that's like communicable disease measles outbreak town kid missed lot fun stuff year. back people vaccinated kids! still remember bummer, definitely feel bad kids now. Also corn Indy 500. It'll cost American public 80 times that, minimum. rate surprised hear stories people eating bats protest. Paywall Well virus nothing like smallpox it’s coronavirus. Comparing Covid smallpox like comparing bird fish. don’t expect fish fly they’re animals birds animals. Saying shit like proves literally idea you’re talking about. disagree. Ohio first really close opened slowly.

And yes mask order came late it’s also comes political resistance finally weak. end day require buy in. DeWine always empowered localities make choices felt best. power send unidentified federal agents kidnap people street Portland, either, yet getting away that, bragging expanding cities, merely they're run Democrats. 

Let's face facts; Trump whatever hell wants, Congress going thing stop him. still seems incredibly difficult

nah, easy - what's preventing us selfishness certain subset country. I'm coping calling school district telling open switch kids school districts cyber school. children going back classroom setting anytime soon. Yeah work preschool school age room, usually school time. We’ve couple parents confirm positive nobody actually school - parents drop lobby kids infected parents quarantined two weeks. scare wear mask day...I see people dipping nose regularly. better believe school age kids playing losing masks rather wearing them. still factor people. think manage. come across pretty competent, initial mess-ups Giesecke cult member Salminen. keep delaying school start dates around Indianapolis. Makes wonder they're really going reopen them. mean? Northeast secede US. Exactly. Though help look hand downs royal. ;-) Interesting, happens someone refuse put dispose soon turn corner? people put mandatory quarantine 14 days, means sea people arrived China 14 days ago quarantined tested nucleic acids, understand that?

""How absurd figure 2,000 Chinese arriving mainland every month, 60 per day, come about?

There's one country world.

In interview 29 March, China's civil aviation authorities said average daily number arrivals implementation ""five-one"" policy 2,000 3,000.

China relaxed five firsts, roughly speaking carrying capacity relaxed 3-4 times means 6,000-12,000 people enter country daily.

That is, understand current range 84,000-168,000 people China entry quarantine?

I live Beijing, Express Hotels front house commandeered quarantine hotels foreigners entering country

Please talk nonsense. read user name Philosophy Free Food.

Apparently hungry. Governor state, literally job push health safety people state ignore vocal minority. fact backed anti maskers once, leaves ""mandate"" somewhat toothless. That's bit concerning tested positive longer antibodies it. could mean vaccine might build immune response needed people. Hahaha like monty python. Coronavirus 2020 biggest joke ever.

&amp;#x200B;

Children abysmal risk wear masks. also going give rubber hats lightning might strike them?

&amp;#x200B;

I sorry dying laughter quicker could ever die Coruna. checking in. 

I definitely see people taking seriously think should, whole tend see people wearing masks, generally following best practices. 

I feel many innocent people trying Florida, Texas, Arizona etc, surrounded selfish idiots lead shit tier governors. It’s perhaps ultimate example “we’re together” even youd rather be. interesting, thanks! US factory make flat medical masks 10 cents each. box 10 retail $12. That's huge margin. many middle men split guess. What? you, communist? 

/s Easter, recall.

I'm sure people still talking much. basically ancient history . Man, I'm you. one asked either. RN tell opening schools would great error.

Since 40% Americans obese, hardly surprising. don’t proof I’d say say it’s most. I’m lifelong conservative (though many friends not) ones know part don’t.

I think maybe region. agree vast worst worst deniers GOP. RIP health worker. Sad see people still contracting dying this. Thoughts prayers go friends family wish best. People need continue following health guidelines want stop virus. Considering rushed vaccines are, better wait bit see happen. MPR said police would giving masks instead fines. Tensions still high around parts state. anyone else genuinely wonder goes inside ""it's flu bro"" guys' heads? keep trying emphasise life can't figure would cause someone think like that. Fuck guys, got expert room. Everyone party Covid. guy says probably get infected again. Must insider info virus know almost nothing about. Prodigy. Man bit demoralising, didn’t realise Australia gettin hit second wave. checked seemed completely control months 15-25 cases per day. they’re seeing 400 day.

This going happen worldwide people start let guards That’s wanted make distinction insist “can’t” ones say “won’t”. shitty behavior definitely different source.

Not trying make excuses either, like said, wear mask cus it’s right fucking thing. people symptom society, society symptom people, etc got voted weeks ago stating florida fucking disaster handling lock down, people telling hell curve flattened clearly worked.

I knew shit going remain flattened long fucking beaches reopened maskless karens swarming stores restaurants. work mall high contact job fucking saw shit happening eyes. 

Then spiked couple weeks later fucking proved right. Fucking idiots. bet could make comparative study showing that. linking data proof

hardly.  difficult get things like dish soap napkins &amp; things still (for us anyway). wish extra freezer heard hard come buy now. Mainly wipe everything get food delivered every two weeks. dread it. used love food shopping...not complain, believe me, saying though. would ever stay sane &amp; safe. well~ Here’s great article rebut that.    

Always ask sources. Nice previous poster comments said there's enough workers staff beds. could enough *beds* (and equipment) everyone USA there's nurses run good beds. 128 days quarantine? US? Lockdown US like weeks now...

Traffic completely normal, gym back normal volume, jobs opening.  Sounds like start another conspiracy theory... Seconded Italians saying may happen back April. excuse caught guard since prior cases Europe. What's Texas excuse? Inshallah Damn you’re hurt protests. trump brought mask less rally OK numbers fucking exploded. However explode protests. Thank you. surreal. seem like 30% Americans fuck everything? outdoor protests didn’t spread virus anywhere near much people feared, reasons, people standing outside Indy probably won’t spread virus much.

What *will* spread virus 60,000 people converge indoor bars restaurants around Indianapolis race. That’s going shit show. I’m England, locked way ever got point. day locked 74 deaths 800 new cases, numbers rose significantly locked down. terrifies think end without distancing measures, unfortunately wouldn’t surprised see least 200 per day death rate states. Hopefully, doesn’t reach point. worry, teenager forever Survival Bias. may wrong called. No, that’s quite right close. getting reimbursed costs. get reimbursement instead getting 70 cents per dollar spend getting 82 cents. Medicaid too.  looked requirements become Canadian citizen? pretty darn strict. Thats far right. conservative-green coalition fighting human rights girls.  It’s staff that’s issue. actual solution president taken industries using defense production act started mass producing needles, vials, syringes, masks, etc. months ago.

But he’s idiot. “I don’t care dies, long isn’t me.” demanded leadership denies reality way do, elected. bad idea...Are going serve food drinks? worse idea Well, exactly. seems like we’re spiking relaxing stage 3 reopening. bad deaths aren’t going anymore cases going What’s that?!? man shameless. ashamed live “great America” leave us burn die 6 months royally fucked barely bury dead get say “yeah wear masks it’s patriotic” least said dude way way way late. literally can’t go store without seeing asshole refuse wear gasoline flame whole time wants pretend he’s fire extinguisher? degree

I see ever noticed 6g looks like 69? Money. Toshihiro Nikai, member Liberal Democratic Party also chairman Nippon Travel Agents Association, (and members LDP) received ""donation"" roughly $400,000 (at least) travelling organisation. surface seem care travel industry basically want pocket money. willing sacrifice Japanese people's lives long stay wealthy. That's kinda drives nuts afraid stay home crowd. 

They mad can't live normal lives yet show think alone keep dive bar open. 

This whole thing would wrapped shut shut down. Instead tip toeing line open/closed spacing prolonging everyone's financial burden.  shame 

My sister told nonsense. yes, live Florida watches Fox. Several teachers district Facebook, bragging district going show everyone “The Rona” hype school going lead way retuning normal education.

We 2 coaches 4 players test positive last week... it’s community. state announced ten day results delay, Arizona Texas closer two weeks happen go college Burlington, VT),

Unfortunately, colleges tend collect students wide geographic range. college safe spot opens, students hot spots bring virus school. See tomorrow headline day 3! You’ve obviously never position you. Also people voting Clinton back 2016, lot demographics changed since then, good worse. don’t data knowledge tracking insurmountable numbers countless counties states make head count, know there’s right entitled opinion say disgusting. far know put out, don’t first hand experience it’s like hospital overrun Covid-19 patients, you’ve never exhausted him, certainly don’t know it’s like dealing idiotic people heads far asses, don’t see refuse understand dangers Covid-19. way dumb sons bitches understand tragedy strikes friends loved ones. stuck shells blame left side situations right personal tragedies.

Fuck Lowe’s, even *Walmart* better now. 1,088 whole state. hospital Rio Grande valley. idea big Texas actually is? 4 hour drive get San Antonio 90% ICU beds full anyway, go Dallas find bed that's 8 hour drive. 

How supposed drive far someone needs ICU bed? 

Who supposed it? ambulance? Didn’t US already pass 4 million? Imagine realizing you’re wrong nothing else say. conversation going straight line, hit brick wall early cognitive abilities haven’t recovered since. Windsor here, plenty idiots here. Mask mandate helps, little hope, keep saying ""it's farms"", community spread keeps rising It’s embarrassing living state. don’t good quote Josh Hawley, I’ll remind everyone attempting sue China coronavirus. read article, deaths single day deaths reported day added many days past? problem exactly personal responsability. ""I choose whereas want take risk not. one besides harmed.""

It's crowd responsability. That's reason rules law enforced. drive wrong side endanger people follow rules.

Here : *proven* ""the mask"" protects wearer, known protect around him/her.

(to casual downvoters know depends category masks, numbers everywhere). That's true all. Many businesses can't rebuilt. new owners ability line financing, yes, many current owners going lose everything. I've always thought Pfizer evil company. Hey, one people! 

Quit 4 weeks ago, looked back. I'm 41 now, smoking since 16. President. new one Google search conspiracy. Hey man I’m downvotes.  Take easy. could cause full term baby weight 5-pound, 9-ounce?? That's little bit optimistic.

Let's call first wave :) main problem widespread ICU triaging people dont covid die due lack accomodation sickness rise well.

this number represented here, need look overall excess deaths.  Narrator: didn't. Could stop that? Mistakes made beginning occurred since. got equipment need, far largest state disease contained, communicated situation well point anyone even challenging mask requirements—much less severity disease—get mocked. results aren’t ‘good camera’.

He’s C+ governor normal circumstances, line attack based happened March/April, wasn’t playbook clear guidance do. mistakes weren’t negligence, case almost elsewhere. even armed customers, try kicking anyone literally one leaves peacefully. Fuck events. don’t need hold events like necessary. It’s fucking car race. gives shit. It’s game. required. part problem country. talk massive shit make false claims. It’s really getting pathetic. 1,088 whole state. hospital Rio Grande valley. idea big Texas actually is? 4 hour drive get San Antonio 90% ICU beds full anyway, go Dallas find bed that's 8 hour drive. 

How supposed drive far someone needs ICU bed? 

Who supposed it? ambulance? Assuming right, 30% deaths covid related, that's still 100,000 deaths 4 month span. 

Is enough you? Used case France, too. fair, official recommendation.

As week, they're compulsory public spaces. apparently, masks work :) still cannot believe assholes went Post Malone concert. Bc safe to, obvs Post Malone concert🤮🤮 hit 4.1mil yesterday. known official numbers. obviously reality given time. 

Those official numbers also right track 5 million August 1-2. make correct smart statisticians ultimately wish so.  I'm man. live world ms refresh rate, things come fast people time absorb craziness.

It's design Trump. conversation, clearly qualified have, going circles. Enjoy permission last word. smart! thank states report one final daily count goes worldometers day, states report cases come number complete counties report. distrust Fauci campaign happened conservative talk radio social media extensively administration started join in. laws calling fascist months ago. think inaccurate say majority Republicans distrust him. Also testing far ahead then. hard assume NY far cases confirmed time LA already cases nation thread help combat FB stupidity? One stop shop combat anti-mask morons, number dodgers (the data flawed), testing deniers, false death counters (my cousin Nebrahomasotta killed heart attack, counted COVID). businesses pop fill gaps. New restaurants open new businesses formed.  business rebuilt. Sadly Bc it’s true. labeling people died covid covid death. instance, gun shot fatality Atlanta labeled covid death died bullet anything it. downvoted said there's nothing helpful knowing 1,000 deaths reported yesterday. disagree, fact find idea offensive. 

now maybe meant, chose clearer. rather saying ""these bullshit stats"" state exactly stats think bullshit.

i personally approach big picture. care fatality rates, positive rates, etc. care 1,000 Americans dying every day, happen. death rate NYC months ago relevant me. That’s less case second. It’s spin! /s thought supposed free.... 

Maybe government bail airlines could afford help us. answer think US bad everybody want come celebrities hate much leave.

I, one, particularly want live US (even without pandemic). to, job-related reasons, probably would, I'm happy don't.

As celebrities, well, go job is, freedom compared countries

That possible, definitions freedom.

But democracy different set freedoms still work well citizens. Blessing disguise, good riddance less polution Um yes, let's say $50k spend car. wanted EV.

I could get the

Mini EV: $30k
Nissan leaf: $32k
Fiat 500e: $35k
Kia Niro: $40k
BMW I3: $45k
Cheverolet Bolt: $38k
Hyundai Kona: $38k
Hyundai ioniq: $34k
Tesla model 3: $41k

Now let's say want regular non compact car actually take family around:

You got 

Nissan leaf 
Kia Niro
Cheverolet Bolt
Hyundai Kona
Hyundai Ioniq
Tesla model 3

Out those, Tesla Model 3 highest MPGe, ""Horsepower"", IMO, best styling, best charging support Fuck. Sooner pisses mars, better. SF Valley here. 

Walked family park street yesterday, fly kid’s new drone. People everywhere, almost one masks. One guy ran right past wife kid, panting full blast. mask. 

If I’d gun would’ve shot him. 

No park us. thank average America citizen it! Tremendous, world class levels short sighted selfishness around ! Next week: ""Since death part life, death life, deaths great!"" Refusing wear mask new hill people willing die on! IDK went school learned properly wear mask might worth decades come. part “no risk low risk” understand?

Confronting customer mask doesn’t lead assault lead shouting match closer 6 feet. Immediately jumping medium risk category. higher risk catching corona confronting individual turns irate, also introduced possibility violent escalation.

What essentially saying road rage ok rarely leads injury death. *simply true.* Road rage avoided costs lead erratic driving puts higher risk accident can, rare circumstances, lead violent escalation.

Why would company subject employees that? “Oh rarely happens let’s roll dice employees.” one gets killed? “Well think infections saved.” No! anyone following mask + social distancing setting already no-low risk!

Like part confusing you? honestly feel really bad can’t see escalating customer lead directly risk, whereas inaction following personal standards social distancing mask use lead almost risk infection. It’s rocket science. even linked medical article CDC backing still don’t get it. didn’t also blame giving bad tests? 

You mean Obama administration didn’t give tests virus known yet? sneaky! /s Honestly, man, schools all? ain't gonna jobs America this. misspelled Florida normal type stores, usually manager expected work hours alone store since never gave enough hours give CSRs. Translation: people like matter. people die.

I never forget many people think haircut beer important life. Yes, hypotheses tested. shown strong foundation testing cant say true false. idiot spout shit. evidence back say backed science.  seems main state taking things seriously. still gonna stand statement? Where’s miracle? gone away? Asking friend.  think also threatening pass legislation strip emergency power governor's office put hands legislature. They're legions bots upvoting posts. Twitter bot playground ""education"", mean daycare. Kids still learn material distance. really live age science become politizied even more. Man, PTSD point various people arguing me, foaming mouth, studies wrong ZINC.

I know lot research underway studies getting written now, everytime see HCQ CQ headline I'm like ... why? blacks really control...

This guy r/conservative yeah like grateful gave sandwiches, plenty airlines would say fuck make sit wait forever sometimes plane. morons dropping like flies. imagine dies days election? get near 100% compliance business sector force many peoples hand. Well appears warm weather isn’t killing virus. Damn. wanted know study fact random? 

We've seen growth rate testing rate India lately. would mathematically impossible numbers study true. couldn’t afford medical care.

That's America normal day. Yeah, no. used work FD, consider high risk area. would get robbed, gunpoint, still hire real security. consider security. less third fatalities.... Probably Cuomo sabotage nursing homes. People act like small number look average deaths per year. average 2.5 million people die year US, would lead number approaching 3 million. slows not. Hello ideal fall / winter weather around corner. without considering survivors become disabled recovery much higher rate.

By end year, everyone saying know anyone sadly know someone died. Please stupid. avian flu small pox would saying thing? isnt hard believe lucky comparably low mortality rate. Anyone questions this, please look history small pox outbreak. extremely believable. mandate came next day  That's even 3 months. surprising... Like lot people say ""you think breathing mask hard? Try breathing ventilator"". hard, people, share please! Oh yeah Japanese people seem easily forget vote LDP anyway, like people Tokyo voted Yuriko Koike who’s insisting holding Olympic next year, instead candidates proposed cancel Olympic instead use money healthcare battle coronavirus. Why? America chose live market rather society long Trump. they're cogs. wanted this. Let enjoy rewards. Great! 

Then agree outside events safer protests, claim didn’t spread virus. 

Then agree. 

Bring events! always knew home depot better store understand liked Trump first. body evidence presented last 4 years — gutting key agencies, lining friends pockets, consistent racism sexism, contempt law constitution — unacceptable changed opinion. 

He literally employing unmarked military now. hallmark fascism. thing Hitler did. 

He consistently worked Russia foreign powers would like nothing see Americans like suffer. 

It unacceptable still “quite like Trump” love America. need wait reason. manufacture one regardless, worldwide conspiracy pandemic. ""We best deaths country world. Believe me"" teacher’s union FL? NYS strong one. believe union would definitely teacher’s backs even logical behaviour would explain health workers needed everyone else, counting people stockpile risk causing shortages. Oh wait... Whip ultimately agree states falsely inflating numbers. 

Every time someone gets tested test positive it’s counted positive test. people get tested multiple times. appears happen widely. 

Texas sure others don’t know counting blood tests (for anti bodies) nose swans (for active cases) “cases” corona virus. 

Does seem right? someone antibodies assumed long term immunity virus (we don’t debate length long term) certainly active case needs reported. [Initial COVID-19 infection rate may 80 times greater originally first account statewide antibody testing, Florida Department Health reported Friday 4.4 percent 123,000 tested came back positive signs )

[COVID-19 cases 12 times higher sites, likely greater 10 times SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred number reported COVID-19 bullshit, almost every case traced known clusters, apart brand new ones Melbourne. would random people al getting case, happening optic putting people unnecessarily risk? hard might imagine, Hilljacks doubting *they can’t see it*. This. don’t buy amazon. Ever. Also, covid ICU noncovid ICU must separate. five bed ICU three non covid patients cannot put covid one two spare beds, kill three.   Luckily, parallel universe, dormers live mother's basement type harsh sounding words internet. trying arrest would like first attempted arrest scene Demolition Man. States remained open Keep head buried, numbers intentionally inflated. said ***since beginning***.

So ***real*** numbers?! understand it, time get tested get results getting longer already bottlenecked. Oh god.

Australia, turn back. know headed.  true resources power much better countries. truly responsibility better. refuse too. good first run online education kids didn’t work particularly well IMHO. large portions country last three months P/F, finals cancelled, one sent summer school remedial activities. kids online classes half kids stopped showing realized ramifications.

I believe online education could good person requires technology investments standardization. wasn’t place probably won’t schools districts don’t money invest. virus 8 months old. one knows. damage causes (by causing blood vessels throw clots, example) least medium-long term, though. neurological stuff may also caused bunch mini-strokes clots. There's growing recognition [long people take long time deal effects disease.

It likely ""flare up"" like chicken pox coming back shingles, though. remember reading real concerns coronaviruses that. Some, assume, good people. hot out!?!? Karen w caps. Yeesh. No, amercians get wanted. 2 million people voted Clinton. Period. End story. remember reading report January told people guy visited KFC 5 minutes like, 14:20 &amp; 14:25, also mentioned ordered single order french fries nothing else. know relevance contact tracing also, goes KFC orders french fries? see comment republican party ""turned out"" persons reply! feels like barely anyone wearing masks.

Most people wear masks social distancing.

The people likely encounter restaurants, shopping, beach small percentage people less likely comply.

You seeing people take seriously taking seriously casually bar hopping.

You see - 25 50 people complying given time? town what? 24,000? 140,000?

I live Florida. people know us Florida Man. state wearing masks, us. us wear masks. beach, either.

How would know we're we're still social distancing see us?  Illinois similar. Starting Friday, Chicago bars/restaurants pickup/delivery/outdoor only. We're losing lot businesses, that's objectively better losing lives. *Narcissistic “We’re family here”. horseshit. think it, it, future develop ""underlying condition"" get flare covid it'll affect way more? Imagine becoming CEO company already setting records upward trend, claiming gains accomplishment. right purely circumstance. Plus, job gains lost due complete bungling Covid response. created virus along entire universe (and devil) knew things would turn way anyway, yes, he's truly bastard. Richmond VA area here, 9 10 wear masks indoors. IIRC, Mexico closed border us, right? try take American victory lap w numbers. ignorant US one biggest disasters w numbers. facts, that's define stupid want know smart is. Always trust Vegas betting sites. say Biden wins. Casino money behind everything mitigate risk losing. Trump pushing Virus .

Does say Covid 19 hoax . Even true, Ireland days zero Coronavirus deaths? people stopped dying CoVID everything else time?

And infection rates 10s? point think Trump better clinton, Trump fan. released report. Median age somebody died covid 78 underlying health condition. vulnerable population.  Fox News OAN didn’t give talking points yet. Please stand by. morals, wouldnt buy anything ever.

If saw package handlers warehouses get treated, online shopping, done. America. humanity. blame. Social distancing lot important mask. mask protects infecting others. police union.  ""As transmission spirals control several states, America reaching critical point, said Michael T. Osterholm, director University Minnesota’s Center Infectious Disease Research Policy.

“The direction next weeks could determine trajectory months come. don’t shut transmission meaningful way, we’re going burn hotter hotter,” said. “The case numbers going get point ability reduce totally compromised. longer choice whether lock down.”

In open letter sent Wednesday Trump administration, Congress governors, 150 public health experts asked U.S. leaders reboot America’s pandemic response, saying, “Shut down, start over, right.”

The letter, organized consumer advocacy organization U.S. Public Interest Research Group, signed epidemiologists, physicians health experts institutions including Brown, Columbia, Harvard Northwestern.

They argued shutting essential businesses buy time. unlike earlier pandemic, called using time reinforce infrastructure needed testing, contact tracing manufacturing personal protective equipment.""

Just clear, think play, would explanation theory. Agreed. read somewhere whole US probably x10. 

In beginning, tones friends turned away testing considered ""high risk"". No, instead practically encourage it. Fucking shameful. would heartbreaking totally preventable. India survey accurate big deal. India's death rate currently 2.4% total cases. 125,000 confirmed cases Delhi time survey would equate 3,101 deaths. actual case count 35x 125,000, though, death rate 0.06%. beyond insignificant.

I think survey accurate way. CDC puts mortality rate 0.65%, significant. NIH.gov studies suggest 
Clarithromycin/Naproxen may reduce hospitalizations significant number cases .

NOT cure - may prevent turning Covid Pneumonia many people .

I understand used large clinical trials- used treat people - Vaccines ready.

And think Trump ( even hate ) push Vaccines thru red tape FAST perfected near perfected 99%)  frustrating directly, lot people still going work living life. Indirectly, reading stuff that's happening causes stress. scare people people wear mask fleeing, states coming north. already happening hospital me. One nurses said they've people Florida Texas want wear mask ER wait covid test. work White House? idea God prevents suffering Christian idea all. Christianity God transforming suffering something saves us world inside out. done economy

Yeah, like, massively inflating national debt declaring trade war China resulted likely permanent loss trade deals caused us spend billions dollars bailing soybean farmers. great deal maker.

At least he's tenacious unwilling give up. Thank goodness Dr. Fauci. wish words fall deaf ears. ignorance insane.  Diet Coke still admire lot work, Spacex fantastic Tesla probably responsible many car manufacturers taking EVs seriously far quicker would done.

Guy's still muppet though. Yeah, luckily school-aged child option distance learning, wife stay-at-home mom already.

So like...half-homeschooling something?

Whatever. kid joining group bring covid home. check numbers malaria perspective. humans naive think save us? It’s virus doesn’t think literally can't travel Europe right lot people suffering.

Here's Miami-Dades case/death charts I'm asking again, assume there's massive incorrect margin here, would assume inflation 50%?

And again, 70,000 deaths enough you? 

I'm really trying work within framework here, hard see means head buried. glad I've quarantining four months.  wear masks leave house reduce odds coming in.  true case. happy people social work circles taking seriously staying home isolate one said perfectly safe. used logic numbers state. protests happened. spike. Large gathering, opened early, record numbers ever since. I’m mad. amazed argue protests spread disease. numbers say otherwise. Every state that’s trouble opened early. Including mine. Texas, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, pretty sure weren’t large protests Mississippi, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Kansas, Iowa, list goes on. vast majority community spread cane bars indoor establishments, well Memorial Day Fourth July events held outdoors. I'm hungry world hunger problem wrong. Salt Lake County blue. Good ol Utah County much red avoid place like well.. plague. like Taiwan it. Open schools strict procedure follow. USA cases are. Kids held back year instead. opening schools thing done countries though. strict guidelines.  [This estimates infection fatality rate 0.68% indeed pretty low far lower 5%+ case fatality rate.

This would mean India's ~30,000 fatalities stemmed 4.4 million cases, 3.7 times many reported. somebody state lowest cases, please get shit together. weird relatively healthy state country shit show feel like easy like first sentence healthcare human right denied. What’s alternative, letting people die curbside hospital?

This disaster scenario northeast warned everyone about, sure people acting surprised...  insurance companies? still make killing (literally).

It takes vocal minority crazies ruin things everyone. stop, dude. websites make effort. Ohhhhhhhh, explains alot. Shame hugs real nice. expect redditors read article, redditors even read damn headline. Governor tried helping postponing school opening got shut state school board. lazy 5:30 coffeed everyone.

Panel, don’t luxury, need make decisions move limited resource have.  US country. noticed we've rapidly increasing number cases deaths. Plus schools set proper safety measures. reason government says ""oh, they're set it, hard do, we'll send anyhow""... make sense?

Either takes every school set proper safety measures, it. Every place business need it, schools?  Prisons shown pretty hopeful thinking well. case/death charts Texas yesterday, running 7-day indeed. wonder feel churches open, also protected exact sentence. 

But none matters. protests spread virus not? yes, say stop lying. no, events perfectly safe. grandfather got Scarlet fever teens died damage heart late forties. always thought crazy. measure that? didn’t help current administration, party largest news channel America spent months calling virus hoax politicizing pandemic.

And lower-income students main problem insufficient Bafög enough cover living expenses rather administration fees semester. there’s daily briefings reports public health team break new cases, deaths clusters. “death rate hasn’t gone up” thing, that’s keep hearing need help debunking (trash) video. friend shared seems genuinely interested learning he's headed wrong path I'm busy get around I'm calling awesome reddit community! 


Not examples cites, also overall effort discredit ""experts"" conservative media general. 


For example, cites 2.2 million death toll example something ""the experts"" got wrong, model used trump administration could try brag saving 2 million lives? Also, model predicted virus unmitigated, I.e. masks social distancing. 


Also, one model, acts like ""the experts"" agreed come together.


Or example cites originally told wear masks later changed shortages CDC want everyone panic buying masks medical staff needed them?


If could share links sources debunking various ""examples"" would awesome. 


Thank everybody!  Even mind boggling 6 months this, still people denying existence virus/how serious is....

But that's complete answer.

Who delivers PPE state's infrastructure cannot function? drivers get sick? trucking companies want liability delivering us? Maybe PPE air drop?

But groceries? already know meat shortages caused people getting sick dying meat processing facilities.

And electricity hospital uses keep patients alive? enough utility employees keep us safe?

I guess army national guard step in. get sick?  means that, people social distancing taking suppressive measures way that's sufficient wipe flu (i.e., keeping R number sustainably 1), Covid still spreading, problem.

The good news less reason defer testing probably flu; feels like flu, likelihood Covid.

Equally, large number Covid deaths people would died flu normal year, excess mortality may bad headlines.

Given high R number associated Covid, none surprising. News parted ways host dismayed fellow staffers came work visibly sick early days coronavirus Childers, early morning host Fox since 2012, benched incident late March. put back air — despite public campaign Twitter messages President Trump.

Seriously?

What fucking hole people live in? response highlight screwed situation many people. 

The way set people quit going work would dangerous, utterly screwed comes income get unemployment quit. 

SO people put situation chose exposure deadly pandemic $0 stuff like homelessness/lack money feed one's family, ALSO bad one's health. Heh. like sub, yeah notice huge economic neoliberalism bent well. 

I think genuine/organic, though: lot people live graphs charts, all, work quants finance Money Life line work, natural think way. Mostly decent folks, though. probably going spread covid almost becoming plague country rather controlling bad economy well health population... would thought? wrong exactly? asked stats, proof, source. according this, didnt shit. program focused childhood obesity. wrong again? exactly move without traveling? mom got test results 36 hours July 4th weekend Illinois. Let's exaggerate. I'm 'making shit up', I'm regarding research done right now, air conditioning HUGE factor indoor settings recirculating air. 

YOU making shit pretending expert working hospital. scientist. guess someone took whole ""slow testing down"" thing seriously Yeah, they're first hit point. see articles pilot programs never hear anything else. Can't wait bunch Americans smooth brains come blatantly mischaracterize country's political economic systems, blame systems virus spreading Venezuela, ignoring entirely horrific consistent failure United States dealing covid governor MONTHS prepare. chose let people die.

Blaming political leaders easy people want prove deserve freedom claim right act responsibly.  time shoot tear gas unarmed protestors give tickets people going 2 speed limit?

Thank sharing 🙏 I'm sure mislabeled, likely outliers. also going direction people COVID tested it.

Even 10% deaths improperly categorized COVID-related, would still leave us pretty staggering number. NYC still largely locked down. people still working home indoor dining gyms still closed suburbs limited capacity indoor things. sad we're still taking seriously states hospitals capacity. ""especially fat people"". Everyone treated they're disregarding health guidance pandemic. Even otherwise healthy people. They're fucking idiots. I'm sorry sister's job, that's kind good thing. headLine lie, masks prevent spread Covid..... God testing faith, exact thing happens people God punishing ""sins"".

It's sad happened them. 65 residents this. sounded like social distancing this. eating 3 shifts, sitting one table, restrictions many people could chapel, attending funerals, among things. articles I'm reading clear actions took though. Staffers still visiting compound, looks like that's sisters got sick. Thanks laugh serious question, obesity go down? would like know is. Especially consider every hospital US similar surge plan. We're going see lot this. I’m Indian I’m sure you’re talking it’s pretty clear you’re building straw man. add insult injury here, part reason laid waste Iraq sold idea significant biological weapon stock pile.

A significant chunk US sheep, willing listen wolfs instruction. anyone think might cause asylum another country? wan die here. Yes. Mostly people, too. Hmm. Let volunteer first sacrifice themselves. conclusion draw list green countries Irish decision based tourism. Countries Irish people want go vice versa. can't different standards. 17,000 deaths average period several months. even whole year. 59% increase average. can’t even imagine many deaths going translate somewhere like US. fuck, China? Billions people, extremely dense urban areas. virus likely spread rural parts country, I’m sure healthcare worse. human race going lose millions people thing even realize official counts. death toll 2020 going triple 2021 take account deaths average. much winning! :( hate ignorant argument. Trump supposed leading. repeatedly dismissed mask wearing social distancing. called hoax. deplatformed public health experts scientists. 

As Trump said, leader responsible everything happens country. practice preaches. buses going needed take infected adults hospitals open schools, IMO..... cracking backfire entire USA? CDC transition near 100% remote workforce, see reason county public health departments can’t. story infuriates me. Well, takes time train dogs, research see effective. article makes sound like Finns past second hurdle. true much hint real world deployment. really says might soon get travel abroad demonstrate skill differentiating samples, depending destination countries' quarantine rules. 

And may research. Everyone knows can't spread virus sitting down. *taps forehead* that's safety regulations cars, rules road, seatbelts, car seats, speed limits, normal people put children unsafe driving situations, even like taking kids office commute long dangerous.

If 1 1000 chance child dying acceptable risk you, must kind person would drive drunk wrong way highway kid rolling around backseat. Fuck this. countries world, know? I’m glad people getting vaccinated free, pandemic. It’s whole world. Yeah, might almost able afford hospital care. kidding. won't. Work food coworkers wear thier mask wrong. dumb thing Covid-19 deniers, skeered lockdowns masks would go indefinitely still skeered that. Despite seeing country country real lockdowns mask requirements already begining reopen safely.


If forced reopening April, states really seen many cases could stayed way, masks would allowed safe reopenings now.


Instead seeing happened New York months ago, happen many states today.


And local governments seeing need pass tougher laws, suggestions.


Can't follow simple requests, getting laws feared. act like rest us give shit, whole ignorant take respect rest society unless law forces to. even content creators entitled opinion, even disagree it. associating content conflicting viewpoints users view sort debate make informed decision sides.

This working, reason people read 20 page EULA clicking ""I agree"".

The content platforms needs clean act, we're slowly moving direction. government impede speech, private enterprises free platforms. nothing censorship state, rather agree pollution sidelined bubbles. *Scottish accent* free-dumb Florida... dont believe Covid doesnt exist “common flu”? freaking Bill Gates, actually freak Zuckerberg. Ironically people believe conspiracy theories use Facebook daily 😂😂 Put cruise ships couple months, without testing beforehand, see feel it. agree happy irony either! Tourism ads always bollocks, though yeah could done better way get back tourism dollars. parties gone extremes. dem party far left point. buggrit wrong longterm economic crippling.

I meant ""ha-ha, we're better country"", since everyone boat cooperation would go lot everyone competition.

(Same thing true within nations cities.) Hey Look, deaths socially responsible July 4th . Right time! maybe can’t get sick again. 

That doesn’t mean can’t enough viral load spread it, come contact again, though. Obviously u/disenfrachised isn‘t genius side. Maybe local, weirdo planet kids independent idiots running city. Yes. help alot. live Indianapolis. results took 21 days CVS testing facility. Absolute disgrace. Protests problem. Hypocrisy, dishonesty, unequal treatment based ideology problems. Seriously. Florida enough humidity back home, need vacation here. could see national mask mandate would shocked nationwide lockdown. already started dating princess still lived baby’s mom. Besides, right break kick ex immediately. princess third wheel like said. husband cheater. speed limits every road Germany.

GOP governor GOP entirely responsible this, blood hands every single person voted continue vote GOP. almost like wanted this, encouraged political leaders maximize death suffering. borders arent even issue lmao COVID everywhere...   reason PA 5th populous state 10th total cases Tom Wolf's ""overreactions"" Preventing deaths pandemic entirely within control. mean really, could possibly seen coming.. experts? #1 baby, #1. America finally great again. right handful people died it, whereas 150k Americans died covid. I'll cite safety go Lowe's. It’s basically indoor dining minus social distancing point, except probably worse it’s even tightly packed you’re stuck longer duration average Yep. Looking now. need teachers there? here. Holcomb great. Calm collected generally voice reason leaning heavily science pandemic. Republicans allow radical conservatives bulldoze scare know best, pleasant surprise. 

Boone County surprisingly cooperative mask wearing social distancing I've witnessed public, though getting house much. county that's almost exclusively blue collar things going pretty well. 

Just goes show solid leadership great influence people walks life message clear consistent. Holcomb great job unifying people making feel like state local governments actually care well-being want best little guy. Huge spike people 20-30 getting now. Good thing applauded people decided group protests global pandemic

Surely anything common age gather inside bars, impossible wear mask drinking, talking close people, spreading saliva everywhere. family same. Pandemic put long pause though. Hopefully make till next year.. gone. competent leadership. think average NE resident smarter average Floridian, despite memes. think know shut listen doctors tell us something.

We also governor, Republican strangely enough, attacked virus early hard. I'm love Baker things, think proved crisis. Credit due. Imagine that! called Cemetery. Tegnell domestically, still enjoy 50% + Swedes supporting right now? point hasn’t worn mask. required. Like photo op va. anti-mask days ago. firsts time recommended wearing mask. Damn fucks even moronic thought. guess sheeple gonna sheeple do.  look states, big business controls media, media funnels information anti-mask anti-covid posts persuadeables, probably pretty easy make number people think way raise.

The powers realized far much money lost people valued safety consumerism. Fair question. Wrong right term. needlessly argumentative seemingly trying discount covid obesity? know said ""you worry 2 issues once"" bring all? thread covid showing signs slowing down. let's worry covid here.

Again, wrong wrong (lol) term. coming well here. don’t test died death. counted dying pneumonia organ failure stroke... New York City, people tried get hospitals either hospital accepting new patients person's symptoms severe enough. They'd try another hospital, sometimes New Jersey Connecticut, overwhelmed well. get admitted, symptoms bad enough energy, they'd stay home, die recover own.

I mean, yeah, they'd call 911, ambulance crews also overwhelmed. could take hours get response, simply many needed ambulance crews find somewhere actually *take* them.

And increased death rate people *without* covid, go hospital soon enough get heart disease, appendicitis, etc, treated effectively. Plus everyone scheduled treatments cancer IBD serious conditions stop delay treatment capacity covid patients. know read point responded idiot, afraid virus, impacts scary. Trillions economic loss, hundreds thousands lives revealed stupid half proud party is. Fearing disease weak, strong understand faster gone, fast get back normal desperately want. cant understand people like cant see political smoke mirrors surrounds this. see disinformation sides- right wants think left wants think itll never go away, Free thinkers know somewhere middle. dont think world ending, also dont want see loved ones die, healthy worried know go forever. 

Tldr, dumb wrong. Let tell conspiracy theory.

Trump obviously Russian puppet point, thus directed fuck things much possible order destabilize US throw over.

I know numbers inflated not, are, could cause panic debate US citizens.

Pretty much conspiracy theory Democrats wanting seize power, replace Democrats Russians Republicans.

Totalitarianism already guys, virus top distract everyone, makes easier control people behind scenes.

(I think virus real numbers real, point every monumental fuck ups virus, purpose) relative waited 3 hours get test week reply. Palm Beach County, one richest counties Florida (I think). like pastors proceed him. people's beliefs way proven track record. School works start next week TN. Already positive cases extracurricular activities past two weeks. Several teachers quit/retired. Area cases, hospitalizations deaths higher ever. Ugh. People quick pick winners losers skin game. Wow thats impressive. know Ireland small even multiply number deaths yesterday accordingly population difference would still zero. that's going change soon American tourists walking around place hate argument. I've literally never met someone AIDS, know exists kills. Many know realise 2021 year we're truly fucked. Covid Brexit alone plunged economic cliff colonial fantasy. Unfortunately media still hold lot sway apparently influence people vote self interest 3 word slogans. country there's bunch deniers, there's still morons there. Sometimes get sick they're critical health system, like fault running capacity. one motorcycle crash, labs iffy reporting,making positivity rate seem higher,that multiple reports besides one motorcycle crash people dying non covid labeled might be, use disposable mask usually happens tend little bigger chin might letting humidity pass. disposable one better filtration cloth ones though work dr’s office prefer disposable I’m working. Cynically? fewer testing = fewer cases.

And stereotypical Japanese would live die numbers, context damned. Splitting population 2 different attending groups would hopefully cut potential infections. Half number kids buses classrooms. One population group (A B) would attendance days other, ideally would prevent least spread. One nuns old color! word intubate they're 4% difficult lean persons 11% 7% respectively. pretty big joke get things done trying take someone’s money. Ok, CT 30 likely indicates individual active infection infectious. Also, two PCR tests taken couple days apart significant increase CT also indicates active infection. Whereas, CT mid 30’s remains stable indicate viral shedding likely infectious. agree, currently process leaving entire country hopefully. real reason Trump suddenly supports masks...he finally got 1000 (soon more) deaths day going norm dominate news cycle. hahaha bra really step far. :)   whats happening Luxembourg? heard yesterday eastern europe seeing another round cases right due general ignorance n part population. idea Luxembourg #'s high. even worse, winter places gets cold.  thousand day NYC cuomo getting sucked entire far left media qualify unemployment fired cause, refusing go work cause. 

It's utterly messed-up situation puts people positions decent, even safe, options. didnt think they'd cross line? Kids getting shot schools decades. give fuck kids. Well, one follow older one, case progress. share skepticism extent. We'll see! dare you! Catholic costumes look way cooler. insult affront almost 2,000 years looking pimp fuck. take back! Believe don’t actually get bill $800 it. work, though? could say thing universal health care school shootings whatnot, things never get through, *America different special unique country compared* etc. Wow idea situation US bad. big countries even 1000 new cases day, let alone death. Floridian expat transfer Nashville years ago: I’m stereotyping, I’m watching home state get filled bodies. Also, sherriffs making public statements saying enforce executive orders masking removed positions held accountable legally contributing illness injury people sworn serve protect. USA sacrificed kids' education quality open Bars Disney never understand.

Here's how, like every damn thing America...$$$$$$$$$! course I'm first person. Obesity massive problem. United states unhealthy. contributing factor deaths covid. Obesity hasnt gotten attention all, see people eating shit food always have, sitting couch always have. Thank part raising conscientious citizen.  like bring containers restaurants leftovers use reusable shopping bags too. think hospital systems also starting get overwhelmed... neccessary people suffer consequences voting order learn.

It painful expensive lesson. Hopefully people pay attention learn something.

I give 40% chance telling enter work. u better change ur tune Lowes  mean, hear knife attacks pretty frequently London 🤷‍♀️ violent people going violent matter what. Obama electrd race. closed, reopened restrictions. Schools country wide closed March till June. Masks mandatory.

You wrong!

Source, souce btw... mean, ""restrictions"" could simple saying ""try distance much possible""  mean, I'm surprised people said open without restrictions, issue VAST amount people believe hand washing, trying stay distanced, cleaning common areas often restrictions necessary reopen, just... mean... insane. work. lot guys work keep saying coroners marking every death corona related

Do work coroners office? Otherwise I'd curious ""a lot guys work"" credible source. Yeah, silly. wanted address people's anxiety pandemic, would constructive ways. Although tbf screaming thing get lot international press, sort ""any publicity good publicity"" stunt. talking straightforward ""come Iceland relatively safe relax"" ad campaign all! Dont penalize citizens businesses 0f Lebanon County anything wrong. 

This money belongs taxpayers - Gov Wolfe! distributed intended used political weapon!!

During crisis unlike lifetime, dare penalize people dared challenge authority lockdown orders may unconstitutional.

He spiteful childish! Thank you. absolutely correct assessment distressingly large percentage. exponential curve mode, august going suck come fall. cant imagine You’re forgetting trump co. didn’t want panic markets crashing. dropped ball aggressively testing locking down. It’s simple. published thorough data phase 1/2 also investigated t-cell immunity smaller trial demonstrating robust CD8+ response. 

The fact got funding warp speed extremely good news IMO. choose vaccine based data far, I’d go Pfizer. might first domino fall. bar booze going next town Hoagieville drinks far outweighs right thing. plan never ""60 days stop spread"" ""60 days slow spread.""

The plan never ""destroy curve"", always ""flatten curve.""

The plan coherent; keep hospitals overwhelmed, they've done. start plan.

Yet celebrating extremes ""success"" 4 months multi year pandemic. long keep inevitably explodes... vocal minority, major minority. lot them, big enough actually make (negative) difference this.

If group compared e.g flat-earthers, would hear whining every get funny videos, impact would neglible. group however managed derail containment process forced US becoming hot-spot 140k dead 4 million confirmed cases.

It's vocal minority, need challenged hard, fast now. needs stop deteriorates further. meant vice versa people countries list travel Ireland. Europeans minds? see vicious cycle sewage revelation. 
While many countries treat raw sewage, others not. 
The sewage simply gets dumped rivers/streams oceans. Fish consume ""delicacy"" food chain loops Here’s math ya: start $200. 

You lose 50%.

Then gain 50%.

How much have?

Pro tip: it’s $200. Fun thing is, US neither stayed open, closed.

You guys went half chub, enough destroy economy yet didnt enough contain COVID uncertainty dogshit leadership lol

It's like deciding jump cliff water change mind last second fall side cliff. saying police/security religious services two groups follow safety protocols? That's Flint. People Flint vacation Kandahar get away violence. Simply untrue. 
the United states obesity problem, world.
Its even obese people, overweight well.
Yea isnt true, course healthy. ways fix it, fixing food industry. 

Its different issue sure, unhealthy directly related obese, making covid worse countries terms death. Thankyou. I'm little rusty. Hahaha! Indeed! I'm fortunate mom works competent nursing home, test weekly, know early ever reaches circle. see one freaking tourist Upper Michigan going freak appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Well, higher proportions Hispanic Black populations getting disease, mostly tend live work places get exposed whites. there'll disproportionate number BIPOC need hospital care.

But time, due historic disparities, BIPOC likely suffer conditions may increase chances getting rejected. mean, right now, hospital spokesman *saying* ""age"", things progress it'll include diabetes chronic lung disease whatever.

What I'm saying that, even criteria applied absolutely evenly, preceding underlying conditions mean Blacks Hispanics *will* turned away, higher numbers likely higher percentages, simply they've disadvantaged white counterparts.   Okay! 

Then agree danger virus spreading outside events. 

Because disagreed, engaging propaganda.   think lucky GP able test me. Got tested Wednesday doctor called following Sunday. 4 days. North Alabama.


Edit add told getting results back within 24 hours, time tested taking 2-3 days. Well yeah, vaccinate 90k people day year. Need military this. 60+ last get it. Two selfish assholes never make good marriage. sources easy find. Wear mask. 142,000 COVID deaths equivalent 3 fully loaded 737 MAX crashing daily since beginning year. 3 jets falling sky everyday stupid people still saying safe fly.

For reference, took 2 737 crashes last year ground entire worldwide fleet. dont deny covid. also dont wear mask. trust reports entity especially media, time time always distraction something much important. Plus Im extremely healthy person rarely gets sick, get blood work done every 3-4 months. Covid affects people much severely underlying health issues deficiences.

If youre worried getting sick wear mask shouldve way covid. really “crazy” think may kind coordinated effort weaken US? Unless it’s soldiers shooting bullets one another people act like couldn’t *possibly* China Russia, working tandem ikr 10 plagues.

And told literally stay home. Sounds like never pregnant lol Agree toxic U.S. politics making situation worse. Many European countries experiencing mild ""second waves"" right yet citizens freaking out: bars restaurants remain open, trains planes continue fly, tourists continue travel, schools remain poised reopen in-person instruction September. 

For Americans -- tolerate 68,000 deaths/year due universal health care rampant gun violence -- get worked coronavirus kind incredible. wish Americans cared ways people die rates higher countries! think certainly saw / read full statement. One try spin Tegnell staying Sweden better Norway, certainly needs spin get there. much willing spend 3M makes full face respirator fan. Runs $3000 though Ffs friend yesterday tell none real...... never going end previously reported, effect face masks reducing spread infection uncertain. Swedish Public Health Agency continuously monitors issue follows new studies. present relevant update recommendations Swedish trains. 

what?!?!?!? Especially rapidly declining pace numbers. situation enter new restrictions, states Anders Tegnell. 

Its Sweden here, I'm getting impression alot countries reactionary rather trying proactive preventive ensure infection burden stays low. countries mandate masks anything preventative data finally shows it, creating unnecessary level future burden.

After happened Australia, I've evolved TTI key must mandatory TTI + masks now. One slip-up mistake creates cluster hard become uncontrollable without masks Melbourne shown.. get decide others? Mask mandate some, Democrat concentration kamps others. chance ever go back lockdown. Trump pissed base first lockdown, he’s hearing saying it’s real it’ll pass. chance go back lockdown, election numbers rise.

He literally willing risk bunch people dying get elected. could’ve whipped base frenzy time, sell MAGA masks turn xenophobia 11. idiots think local water sources poisoning fluoride. Unless live Flint, MI, tap water that. figures sad, one understand prisoners spend 24/7 there, students school fraction time. So...it makes sense spend prisoners, provide everything lives. School not. ""lack resources"" Im sorry, read news? One big reason people push going ER long possible get hit surprise 50k bill. 

Also obesity ignorance (cant happen me, bad flu, fuck masks freedumb, etc) think concern people know response downplaying using masks early on. explained getting right first unknown virus easy video clips dismissing masks early bad, even wanted nurses doctors. admit education system shitty yet still want kids go school pandemic? Makes sense.

Schools daycare. rely public schools watch kids work, kids. actually saw meme right-leaning Facebook page said this. people lack humanity.  don’t think shut training don’t know couldn’t go remote...during pandemic. least smaller groups - preferably outside - least minimize risks exposure multiple people. Lmao. projection painful here.

You’re one spreading propaganda opinion.

Several studies proven spread virus protests minimum yes - rationalize point actual scientific data back position.

Sorry doesn’t fit agenda 🤷🏻‍♂️ patient privacy laws werent thing think people would take seriously. terrible see hospital worker general public doesnt get view do. Government agrees 15 countries travel 'green list' following late-night Cabinet meeting  Idk, looking India chart seem route claim throne No, don’t.

They use flu monitoring service takes small sample across country lab-confirmed flu-like hospitalizations. adjust data based sensitivity lab tests, adjusted match US population.

Deaths hospitalization ratio calculated using laboratory-confirmed data, ratio applied adjusted hospitalization estimate above. modified looking causes death death certificates lab-confirmed deaths, finding causes death non-hospital deaths assuming similar percent also flu deaths.

There nothing based excess mortality data. don’t know you’re getting that. cited papers discuss excess excess mortality calculations, it’s context justifying method.  hard believe? US supposed civilized, yet lots anti mask protests Karens rebelling people rules help them, following leader little stop COVID19 first wore mask days ago, we've anti mask murders too. US: 19 days. India: 33 days. 

according math... agree perspective, discounting evidence coming regarding harrowing long-term pulmonary, cardiovascular, neurological, even psychological effects virus. 

It's situation avoid getting cold flu *may* hospitalize now, one *may* life-long disability catch it. Fuck Dr brix. Sellout Weird thing is, Republican leaders could scored major political points came masks. could said, wearing masks, need mandate it--and really, truly encouraged people wear them, shaming don't. approach would made issue personal freedom/responsibility v. government overreach. 

Instead, went masks we're shitty situation. Yea, I've said quite while, think would, sane times, conservative. agree hands-off approach many aspects life, agree Democrat approach decent number things.

But end minor philosophical differences compared science, facts, truth vs feelings (mostly anger hate), now.

I never thought I'd spot wishing 2 parties again. This. feel like entire adult life trying convince parents utterly wrong republican party. views become extreme time, get anxiety thinking room politics, also responsible at-risk health clearly aren't. be, thank you! agree. I'm saying lot easier juggle work school children. broken neighbour.

You smart kid. Either that, deny someone ICU bed would otherwise survived person going die anyway taken slot. I’m joking. Seems like way aren’t taking seriously, take seriously, actually get (or loved ones), severely. BIGLY.

If get mildly, it’ll even worse claim “see told so, it’s flu!”. See Brazil. Canada told RN son get covid make sure put ventilator. said lived good life save ventilators younger fellow young family. told ethics committee would never even consider ventilator many health concerns. Setting ethics committee late stage game dumbest thing ever heard of. means operating without ethics committee since day one. Shameful. taught middle school even kid used double numbers fun head.. fact adults can't figure bewildering. Well heart disease, cancer, diabetes contagious last time heard...  ""Maybe, like us, really know COVID-19 capable of. know, question simply going protect families.""


How know point virus capable of? LOL pay difference average cop average lowes salary far apart. Impressive USA done Perhaps would benefit sort online learning opportunity  It’s epitome “it hurt confusion!” may misunderstand I’m saying. figured single stupid news report saw told false dangerous information. don’t listen damn thing think virus politics they’re easily manipulated lies. Matt Damon cast members came talk coronavrius old movie Contagion, made point say played character immune coronavirus movie, believe immune covid 19. thought necessary? realized yes... Yes necessary. isn’t general attitude all.

Down south, adults certain age taking things seriously since original mask mandate miami-dade shutdown.

But, recently younger adults stupid ‘going clubs.’ point, get tyranny ""asymptomatic transmission,"" probably less problem understand. many ""asymptomatic cases"" actually real cases -- mild symptoms went unnoticed -- pre-existing cells quickly destroyed virus? Mary/Saints thing. Protestants think Catholics Eastern Orthodox worshipping idols statues icons saints Theotokos. couldn’t remote training least year? Yikes. rests airline, even contracted flight. better cared home? doctors, nurses, medicine, equipment home. suffer die home care? Congrats! Enjoy random hard-ons....its like teenager again. worry, insomnia lasts couple months Estonia Lithuania Slovakia popular holiday destinations us irish? Thats news Maybe America county concept. real human people, children stuck broken machine. Donnie gonna mad Ronnie. political issue.

Politicians create policies address public health issues.

They absolutely need involved. cannot fix systemic problems without political backing terms resources, implementation, compliance, etc. went emergency room 2016 waited 6 hours seen nurse (not doctor), got one shot pain killer told leave. excrutiating pain spine completely fractured, explained multiple times accident in, jam packed people get everyone nearly dead emergency room.

I'm sorry happened you. I’m heading Dont panic crowd says it’s inaccurate Covid Numbers. Regular deaths mixed Covid ones worries 🤨  Take u! terrible here! work healthcare county really starting spike. I'm scared see going look like month live NY assure still clusterfuck. NYC main spawn point lack better term. since NYC strict guidelines everyone listening leaving. infectes people started traveling less restricted ares everyone infected again. retracted rules changed rules place. business owners half know also cross fingers arent breaking newly made rules change everyday.

I think constantly changing rules frustrating masses. Making ""rebel"" masks etc...

I think want keep changing stuff, makes sense learn precautions. However, needs windows change. example like 2 week window adjust new guidelines. governor literally tweets new conference says ""starting now, youll fined"" grounds evidence even made changes.

Its clusterfuck. damn masks people hard. Also Healthcare Worker or? seen. Maybe ""Short time"" till result People could comment get absolut nothing tell compareable feeling? Would maybe raise hope thats everywhere US bad. really missed biggest issue... Yes COVID everywhere cross boarder infection makes entire thing much complicated. Hong Kong's 1st wave outbreak exactly due borders... Who’s say?

All know it’s foreseeable future. daily infections rate keeps going 5 months still plan. say easy? Nope

99 percent people complaining masks people working blue collar jobs. self-centred people yell, threaten abuse service workers simply trying keep others safe. 

This much North American problem. We've spent 40 years emphazing indivudual telling people thing society, owe nothing anyone else. 

Compare today WWII generation. blacked windows, rationed food, gave could war effort. could never imagine society today making level sacrifice. 

Also look Japan, South Korea many people also work blue collar jobs plenty people dragging things around pallet jacks. hear anyone complaining wear mask. get it, trying protect others. Love username Wrong, mask protects wearer well others. I'm IL, got tested along two coworkers 12th 13th, we're still waiting. Day 10 11... attacking authors study, study makes Ad Hominem attack.
I think read appeal authority since clearly know talking about. Hope governor sleep well night No. moved goal posts. whole goal flatten curve allow hospitals overrun.
Week week data shows done  say log complete genetic sequence stored government. definitely implied. remember: NY told wear masks social distance, etc. hit hard without intel treat well. Shame states learning NY lessons. Ignorance bliss. slowly starting look like Elysium movie. Half developing country struggle pay amount. Especially family 5 children. price surely impact poor hardest. Sorry loss friend PA waited 15 days results. Wtf. Hmm maybe children species adults 🤔  Yup, denied company crooked hell, tried demote reason, huge pay cut, refused fought unemployment called insubordination. Went appeals cunt sided company happy lose almost half wage. least enough savings survive bit. That’s gone now. USA sucks!!!! Americans can't migrate Canada ""economic refugees."" complicated process. first wave Corona, current wave hopeless stupidity hearing ""Calendar Girl"" head, started thinking Deadpool, remembered celebrate International Woman's Day decided kind fit. recent serological study conducted National Center Disease Control (NCDC) showed 22.86% 21,387 people tested COVID-19 showed signs exposed virus.

They'd duplicate least... 2 times? I’m good ends Olympics.  84% stocks owned top 10% wealthiest americans.  UK also active research area. makes sense - unobtrusive way finding infection rates climbing. look CDC data. steadily gotten better week week.  expect? flattened curve. goal never zero Thank! Also cool track people wearing masks not. good paper collect enough data. Lucky Barron. Thank you! please get back talking Rampart?  Tldr : Yup best current information indicates wearing masks necessity. American does, continue long needed, I'm planning wearing one flu season anyway. can't say word ""bankruptcy"" expect anything happen Sort seems answer many places. School near segmenting school hallway (no switching halls) bringing food rooms, splitting school half one half comes mon/wed, Tue/Thur. 1-3 graders arnt really risk.  yea fair enough. Thanks :) thought thing maybe key part ""to spare""? “Show death charts”. Good questions! took time go peer review process make various changes. broke geographic areas Seattle New York City still found declining interest February shocking see. hope results show health policy makers peaking public interest critical use search engines help gauge well. I'm going argue second wave already starting parts country 'got right' lockdown. 

The problem know 2 weeks going blend rest country/ That's great analogy, never thought way.

This anti-maskers ""statistics"" infuriating. simply knowledge concept actually understanding situation yet talk people ignore experts listen *them*.

Shitheads.   societal approach fuck I’ll want number people infected insanely high. Hopefully seeing plateau, it’s going spike schools open starts early August Oh you’re super healthy won’t get affected zero problem carrier passing someone could severely infected. wearing mask inconvenient you. Nothing see here, normal.

If people cared, would something it. Prince George's county (where happened, health worker's employer) one Democratic areas country 50% residents list atheist religion. entire government Democratic, 2016 election county voted 90% Democratic candidate - nearly many Green Party Write-Ins Republican. 

In around D.C. (P.G. County suburb DC) see many neighborhoods mask usage around 25%.

The virus care voted for, religion may turn to. People thinking virus hurts poor people cities (like many right believed March) hurting idiots south (like many left believe now) feed problem. What's pathetic right-leaning ""people"" entire argument, liberals using covid take America, would perfect excuse Moron Cult wear masks, socially distance, stay home, etc.

If virus can't spread, Demoncrap's evil plan take America fail. Right?

These disgusting people really believe anything. much cognitive dissonance. Hence support Global Warming. mean, get back find group Americans 'sympathetic' murdering aid workers live video.  exaggeration. Effective lockdown could crush 3 weeks, assuming high levels participation. problem dont know co-operate common threat. cognitive development Unfortunately thing sworn serve protect thier paychecks smaller fraction population susceptible, less likely infectious person find one spread them.

If 100% susceptible population someone average finds infects 1.2 people infectious, 75% susceptible population they'd average find 0.9 people total infections would decline time even absence immunity continuing increase. 'generation' shrinks rather growing. Fauci’s work can’t nothing. top person responding HIV AIDS crisis back began here. fought pandemics before. also administrative incompetence refusal deal scientifically problem before. knows get better. genuine feelings would national treasure. 

I family member running COVID testing site. One day really surprised saying “well isn’t first pandemic. went med school residency height aids crisis. disease wasn’t magic one isn’t either.” kinda shocked, absolutely correct, hadn’t drawn comparison covid hiv. talked like working aids patients back then. misinformation, slow progression, lot similar. Religious leaders wanted block healthcare workers giving condoms, starting needle exchange programs. people fighting masks, demanding reopen. We’ve seen before. wearing mask isn’t crime unless legally defined way. cases states, governors made enforceable mandate. become law, heavy suggestion, cases. No. One-fifth 70%-80%. Yesss Foa moa yeers!!! far I'm concerned, choosing wear mask equivalent choosing sign DNR. Fuck em. without measures taken would 50k deaths day worldwide challenged hard anyone common sense “leadership” doesn’t hold accountable feel empowered shallow, juvenile snark. 

There ""projection"". Coronavirus spreads breathing, thousands people congregating loot protest breathe, therefore breathe others' breath. shared breath, likelihood infection. That's ""projection"", basic common sense.

What ""projection"" saying increasing shared breath, circumstances places, increases likelihood infection -- single situation, not, simply favor motives rioters/protesters.  Answer: Man, hear ya, job easily automated low skill, it’s probably gone. gotta figure something Trump idiot, seem whole population fucking country. exception. Republicans first want wear mask ""un-American"" Democrats go completely crazy protests looting orgies trough whole country. dumb irresponsible be. seems limit. put fault Trump. catastrophe brewed sites, Trump one many failing parts.  quarter county only.... entire presidency Trump foreign actors baiting America position. There’s reason Russian election hacks supported him. Look, I’m saying need make space someone going die, needs different solution, one thought way got point. Like masks, social distancing protocols, setting sites transfer non-critical patients order free beds create ICU space, IE like New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania beginning this. 

My comment sarcastic (hence /s end) imply think it’s implying.  thought smokers weren’t affected virus lungs already fucked virus nothing them?  That's funny ""conspiracy theories"" said trust numbers media saying thing. God keeps telling listen science won’t. kills them. ""not anymore"" implies never want Americans, obviously untrue. Might day yesterday. recent. government media too. Everyone worried backlash fat shaming hiding/ignoring fact obese HUGE factor death, especially younger people. 

I've even seen subreddit calling fat shaming someone points article says ""perfectly healthy person dies"" meanwhile picture see obese. 

People shouldnt fat shamed people need educated obese makes high risk treat much deadlier virus peers obese. least part people want feel like control situation. terrifying face reality realize there's absolutely nothing except wear mask, socially distance stay inside long takes go away. county health departments jurisdiction federal guidelines. 

Luckily people us expected us terrible leaders point. Ooooooooooops replied article March haha. read redditor saying *recent* increase testing, one found fit went wiht forgot check date. 

Another quick search finds article: makes sound like genuine increase, artifact testing. tbh sure! states needs “reasonable” cause, would able argue company risking life isnt reasonable. want document everything brother hard copies voice recording Condolences family.

Maybe possible lawsuit unlikely since MD's Prince George’s County Health Department. 

""Department leaders declined answer specific questions, citing health privacy laws. Instead, county health officer Dr. Ernest Carter said statement *heartbroken* loss valued employee worked since 2001.""

""Prince George’s officials respond questions employee illnesses affected department’s operations.""

What BS!

If cared employee, *should* treated better *prior* event. anyone heard customers getting fast food place? sure track heard. “We going get anyways what’s point.” “This never going go away, what’s point.” (Friend wearing mask) swear way around Ya really war fighting virus. ""failed miserably""?

Please provide examples. also highly likely he's puppet though... took freedom breathe God's perfectly designed respiratory system, took lives.

/s I'm well past feeling sympathy people catch virus die selfishness stupidity. Darwin's law action can't convince save people want saved. They're literally willing die baffling stupidity. can't deflect fact virus *has* *will* kill children flu, course many years existence, responsible deaths. 90’s pretty normal. mean seriously. Re-election completely pocket he’s braindead ignorant see how. evidence show me? basically I’ve telling graduate program administration still claims they’re trying hold “some person classes fall” “plan back campus winter” literally ask administration they’re really stupid appearances... won’t give straight answer.

It’s enough make question credibility program itself. Like said, closed borders EU countries early much easier get another state country Okay, yeah agree. sounded first like saying state fail, *only* American people, struck wrong, get clarification. Yea based looks long term damage lot people getting reaaally think want anybody kids getting multiple times. Also there's vaccine people getting years road? 1000 Americans died single day yesterday. let's pretend otherwise guess thinking frosted flakes. care economy whole care people hurt dying every day this. stock market's up, they're fine it.

All want push responsibility onto someone else. things closed, closed it, therefore fault. things open going poorly, shit keeps rolling downhill. Federal level says states make choice handle it. Governors say needs things locally (unless locally, try take precautions). Locally, say shop owners. Shop owners say there's rules, someone really wants come without mask, that's person.

It's pushing responsibility onto someone else.  someone notices flu, already spread it. contagious even presymptomatic. It’s similar Covid way deadlier kids. California lot nice weather year round. People used going outside public places events. mother called back March. said wait weather warms NY. Everyone going stir crazy sitting inside months head spreading virus even more. protests riots sane two three week period Memorial Day weekend... people can’t help going interval rhythms. desperately want go back freedoms had. states reopen citizens take mile instead inch. ever notice people try make arguments without credibile sources? believe you? sources prove information? know trying hide fact cake? don’t know it’s reported. would assume positive came back, maybe back date it. It’s easy way screw numbers. I’m PA I’m places like 24-48 hours others hear waiting 7-10 days. it’s messed up. anything companies saying production take year make desired amount? I've seen bunch users say vaccine ready couple months take 10 months enough production get it. able track timeframe report read yet seems popular opinion. sort sad true first world countries get vaccine first. could see long time poor areas countries access it. bet America everyone vaccinated early next year that's gut feeling. Also, think another year :S St Louis numbers spilling believe numbers inflated, yes. According  26,001 results came back today, percentage positive still stable 0.4%.  borderline he’s obese Shutting would admission wrong reopen, way. people simply cannot that, dig heels matter what. point would valid car crashes contagious. Otherwise it’s pointless straw man. Way conversation. must fun parties.

It [works exactly stated Moneyline odds least. Maybe live another country odds reflect expected results house pay them. simple. Maybe maga like odds right now? Beheaded buried crossroads think. Ever think it’s act like douchebag? nurse Canada I'm remind sound like worst scenario kind situation experience tells think hit bottom, may well get worse gets better. Next step much harder triage choices like John 26 yo covid 19 needs intensive care Robert 55 heart attack stroke decide go John younger likely survive even though proper care normal setting could saved easily. Plus covid patients admitted days sometimes weeks there's terribly slow turnover rate there's risk get staff sick leads even less carers. shit possibility last while... easily downward spiral. guess that's happens country ruled narcissist political economical priorities human decency. mind, I'm terribly sorry medical personnel/staff hospitals deal whatever's next. Plus added stress lasting mental effect may them. top that, I'm absolutely devastated everyone lost lose family member friend pandemy. Even know someone, Friend mine America recently lost dad c19. wish different However time act differently get shit together reach next worst case scenario. articles really singing praises fact SCMP publishes critical articles China, nothing statement dispute point published linked article false. Yes didn’t get sick. Or, yes didn’t die. Well, There's always Mars. Calculate 10,249/56,231=12.31%

FYI, math wrong one, 18% figure noted earlier could said local beds. statement hyperbolic. bit alarmist, Fauci.

-Trump, raging dickhead. almost like chosen lead country ruin divisiveness willfull ignorance... Bad bad bad.

And built-in hospitalization lag still rising we're even close daily deaths peaking. likely Universal Studios.

The consequences clear - company policy ""don't tell truth anyone anywhere means"" extremely broken.

It's one thing ""right-to-work"" state company fire someone facebook post - somehow situation seems little different since health well-being employees customers involved. crazy. anyone know patients followed transmission mitigation protocols didn't. caring another human dies not, human beings happen live around patients think right thing pretty messed up. Show little empathy least actively hostile toward total strangers. Listen, understand. Coronavirus there. can’t bargained with. can’t reasoned with. doesn’t feel pity, remorse, fear. absolutely stop, ever, dead. Yep. Many experts say wipe groceries spray disinfectant. Covid19 foodborn either.

Here do, wash hands,put gloves on. wipe cart. Get stuff, pay, put groceries trunk, put cart away.

I take gloves trash toss em.away, sanitize hands immediately take mask(never touching front mask) dispose that. sanitize hands again.

 Anything isnt perishible need leave trunk garage day. put gloves bring stuff garage floor. item sealed inner carton, remove outer package toss outside. Im.done putting everything away wash hands wipe potential contaminated surfaces.

In summary, wash hands touching stuff. Shit ton homework guess. problem they're entitled stupid...despite so.

They lack shame knowing wrong. guy originally replied did. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯  still wave 1. :(  Yes, virus spreads there, spreads even better you’re indoors. fat people, poor dental health, o4 diabetics, people smoked ever, people ever used illicit drug, taken prescription outside doctors orders, sped, done anything reckless.

We give actual care absolutely perfect human beings take zero risk whatsoever follow every rule T.

/s, obviously. something Holy shit, Texas fucking insane....

We're distance ed Nevada least three months, opened freaking casinos. Whats process like ""prove otherwise""? armed society psychopaths ensure nothing work. fuck says trading lives recreational activities?? don’t live family old people. literally putting anybody else danger. There's also assaults store employees masks US cities. Also fines discriminatory! Criminalizing minorities Reddit: need huge fines wearing masks. defund police! don’t want police enforcing non violent Reddit: police need devote resources handing tickets wearing masks! confused.

Didn’t Newsom go tv yesterday explain enough Ppe. article makes sense obviously propaganda. realize coronavirus 1800s... can’t get test don’t virus. /s Wow really like showing shit brains. Go away child - diaper needs changing. supported lockdown, morons base would turn violating rights. decided best secure base cost everyone else. can't live death either. know least two people got survived, one (directly) died. generally hang really smart people self-isolate wear masks public.  approach worked all, fact opposite happened. anti-vaxxism creationism, outlandish conspiracy theories, clear past decades, decentralisation information dissemination increased accessibility popularity bad information.

The current system working pretending magically correct feeding information masses strategy doomed fail. core reason lot bad ideas bad information actually appealing biases good information. Except anti-maskers contributing reason hospitals overwhelmed. consequences actions. least be.

Also one said anything refusing care children. victims circumstance. sounds high. source that?

The US lifespan 6 years longer world average, US life expectancy 80 less 10 know tell it, guy can’t get enough ;)  won’t find concrete data there’s way knowing exactly people contract virus. It’s like test say “oh shit; one obtained Applebee’s!” Contact tracing isn’t good.

But use common sense. Think virus better chance spreading apply situations locations people likely gather without masks on.  I'm Florida. April everyone saying ""Sunlight kills virus. anything worry about.""

Like Italy fucking sunlight. Blood type associated severe worsening symptoms people tested positive COVID-19, report Harvard Medical School researchers based Massachusetts General Hospital.

Their findings, published the Annals Hematology, dispel previous reports suggested correlation certain blood types COVID-19.  Pharoah's son.  Never assume malice incompetence likely cananda seeing spike cases, portion due americans coming across borders. seeing florida plates popping followed outbreaks. America going kill many people stupidity nation. Fuck it. Give China’s slot summer olympics then. 

Poor Japan. economy don’t need shit Yes, i’ve meant problem regarding health issues. Gotta love clueless generalizations. ""YOLO"" LockdownTV seriously trash. fitting cringe-tube. Yeah, car accidents contagious. one kid gets flu......they stay home school! Erections. I’ve always exercised I’m good that, thank you! Update: school offers online learning mandating masks. probably online learning transmit grandmother often contact with. fellow students choose attend school, hope memorial page back year book who've passed COVID, hopes up. family intending avoiding contact virus, many families area not. NY shutdown little peak comes Florida wide open business. People (I assume non-scientists) like tell (in sub) vaccine going solution COVID-19. ~70% population considerate concerned enough get vaccinated, we’d see people wearing masks social distancing instead traveling pleasure eating restaurants. It’s us, we’re problem. unless come vaccine stupidity, looks like natural selection going thing unfortunately means lot good, responsible people die along idiots. young adults are terrible at recognizing consequences.

If case much climate change protests concern expressed led teenagers young adults, understand full well *consequence* nothing planet less habitable i.e. stuffing future. asking Doctor state Texas knolwedge situation mostly limited Texas would focus describing events Texas? Good question. There’s lot articles last three weeks saying deaths coming lot people saying Russians baited Trump position. think they'd better looking US allies. Bait Trump making pig's ear coronavirus response, thus destroying reelection chances, get new president knows play international politics normalise relations, knowing US charge mind tomorrow via Twitter 🙄 know. I’m Mississippi Delta. It’s Southern Baptist get. Perhaps bemoaned fate afterlife behind closed doors. 

Now, clearly openly pitied Jews friend doesn’t know he’s talking about. death certificate doesn’t determine hospital gets paid. treatment Covid patient billed... treating Covid patient. Yes, believe trying say logistically impossible (or difficult them) transfer ICU patients counties decline (emphasising ""for us"" part). go ICU beds they're still almost full anyway considering Starr County [located see why.

You're right 1,000 ICU beds left state that's logical conclusion come too. option he's lying. adorable, feel-good article updates Finnish COVID dog program. remarkable: researcher, Kössi found positive samples greater reliability PCR tests antibody tests.

But there's record scratch yet know everything disease,"" says scientist. ""For example, dogs identify someone sick long recovery? form chronic coronavirus?""

...Uhhhhh let's hope not. Let's hope detect endocrine disruptions something take get back normal post-infection. yeah potential COVID cause persistent infection something discount hand evidence, sadly. send clear message nation governors lives Americans important economy wearing masks must. done day one. also wearing masks public help show people right thing is.  We're well week turnaround times metro. You’re right, better lock live lives fear till virus goes away. Give break...

They’re even confident vaccines work right away. virus isn’t going anywhere soon, can’t live inside let small business go people going federal unemployment week. yes, let’s keep things shut tell people hide inside instead promote ways improve immune system. Everything hear government staying inside hiding. Where’s talk healthier, taking vitamin supplements #1 killer covid patients, exercising? answer hide everyone inside anymore “slow curve”, people free make educated decisions. GET SCIENCE! /s definitely exposed anti science fuckjobs way could never imagined 15 days results South Florida. Damn Ohio! Y’all testing led water well, response time pretty damn slow. It’s unrealistic expect people stay home months end. think that’s wrong message point. message wear mask, stay away people use proper hand hygiene. Avoid places transmission risk greater.

You start telling people stay home four, five months that’s run resistance.

I certainly don’t stay home, go less normally would. live UK, local hospital hasn’t case since start may. Yes fault. Hey least one dude wear mask anymore. yet states suffering worst outbreaks day-long queues get tested, weeks get answer, high positivity rates massive, growing backlogs. Project Warpspeed need it? /S behind heart disease cancer daily deaths. worst top daily cause death usa.

What dont understand daily deaths consistent. like less reported days others. Unfortunately, insane people exist north well. I'm Canada still people spouting ridiculous talking points listening fox news. definately smaller percentage population though...and running country. way beyond ""not pro science"", way beyond ""anti intellectualism"", ANTI science ANTI intelligence. typically capitalism works. Small businesses shudder. Large corporations continue sucking socialist tit. least Obama made us money last bailout. money never seen again. line pockets, average American left dick hand. Good article Holy shit Batman! actually work? wait begin reopening due low active cases, yesterday also put biggest case increase far. see lot columbus grocery stores. 100%, like 70-80%

It's enough, nothing. That'd beautifully terrible ending beautifully terrible year. It’s like solution somehow masked view. could answer be? Well cities less alg2. Specially older students pay health insurance pay things someone alg2 would get free. 

But small part time job right yeah.  It’s almost stocks don’t reflect economic reality people something. Stop sarcasm. used half-jokingly clarify post meant sarcastically - might misunderstood. Elective surgeries unnecessary testing cash cows never tried begin with. Orange shitstain calling hoax March. right get shot face asking someone put mask. thanks.

Simple. Shoot first. mask, service, free bullet. Hollywood's message Americans 60 years now: stop fucking, start killing other.

And look society now. government insists schools fully open threatens communities defunding comply, court trying overturn Obamacare cut health insurance tens millions Americans.

Download risk parents man top publicly refuses take responsibility. recipe long term hurt carry long administration gone. 🔥🇺🇸🔥 exactly really think big deal extra 1000 people dying US day top deaths? course include tests taken recent weeks people *still awaiting results*, folks can’t get tested due wait times / can’t travel / won’t get tested. economy runs blood working class buddy, ownership class eager throw bodies grinder keep shambling on.

And since make rules, I'm afraid fucked. define commodity necessity me?  Remember: won't. 1) hospital revenues actually shut elective procedures actually cut staff

2) yes get funding Covid-19 hospitalizations isn’t making loses (therefore incentive classify Covid anything else)

3) don’t get funding someone dying Covid-19 would artificially inflate deaths?

I’m trying argue look like source holds Reminder Japan hit 1000 total deaths yet im giving bath admission 20 minutes. Thats one patient encounter too. course shift im sure im rooms least 4 12 hours im conservative. hospital 2 negative pressure rooms per unit, past one worked 1 vast majaority covid patients rooms. still tb patients would take priority rooms pop up. Negative pressure really helps keep things contained inside room too, youre still risk transmission youre room. 

Choir understand. Choir taught project voice air across room keep mouth fairly wide open help resonate sound. Youre also shoulder shoulder, depending layout could half circle singing others faces. pretty different gym still maintain fairly safe distance heavy breathing due exertion rather consciously attempting breath out. gym required masks times employees walking around asking people mask took off. Cant speak gyms though like said.

I pointed restaurants specifically also people sure wearing masks need remove eat. Thats think recent boom probably tied towards gyms opening up. Im sure couple people get gyms, im trying say im sure contributed say retail offices opening up. Ahhhahahahahahaha Oh meant never heard personally. Yea I’ve heard *of* it. I’m sure lot fundamental extremely conservative sects believe rest heretics. common attitude I’m sure. Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health ran COVID-19 tests two hours testing event July 21. They've holding events every week month, health professionals said things changing Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health moved testing events three days week lunchtime parking lot, Tuesdays 9:30 a.m. 1 p.m. Bismarck Event “Now lab swamped statewide numbers up, ability us get additional tests option unfortunately,” said Bismarck-Burleigh Public Health Director Renae Now, region must split 1,000 tests week area counties. But, Moch said went 800 tests July 21 turn people away. I’ll admit, thought high population density, frequent food shopping widely used public transit played role making bad places. 

I figured sure, places similar features would suffer too, suburbs ex-burbs, don’t even functional busses trains. They’re set make quarantine much comfortable easy! didn’t figure mask resistance, parties, general hostility common sense. Obama's people incoming Republicans actually (2-hour?) ""role play"" global pandemic weeks leading handover ... generally think lot people really unfit. complain breathing mask instead realizing cannot walk flight stairs without huffing puffing problem. Sure mask may add bit challenge poor cardio/lung health begin with. easier blame mask though. people also seem think healthy enough come Covid unscathed... Looks like tough times saw doll....he's branch fields make ends meet specifically illegal. ridiculous criminal! Can't believe people, literally see corpse deceased lined front hoax bad media making sound worst is. Like come insensitive deaths country's people? Americans dying, 140,000 deaths far, almost 150,000, still downplaying real.

I HATE TIMELINE :(

Edit: Fixed typo  work outside think helps kill . level ignorance borders delusional Impossible, I've seen half dozen pseudoscience papers explaining R0 2 actually exponential happen one reopens. 

Reality must lying. /s way last 6 months. 🤷‍♀️

I don’t understand question. Stock markets aren’t necessarily best indicators economic health re: pandemic's effects (see: US markets), it’s still notable Danish market performed well outperforms markets Europe. seems like European markets may bit tethered reality US ones, anyway. 5,3 millions Norway, three people hospital... 3!!!
Since viruses think, humans to. Id like want die life still provide That’s less half making before. Yep... Doubling every two weeks.

Remember folks got bored virus?

Viruses get bored. Regardless motive, decision directly caused death thousands. 

So thread folks diverting blame ro medical ""experts,"" info hand time... basically anything absolve leader state responsibility. trump dictates individual states due far shut letting decide reopen. Tool. listen Fauci’s early theory wearing mask all. people can’t turn around practice new regulations. Isn’t job foresee things public don’t? Besides, many paper showing even simple piece cloth slow spread significantly. Trump’s action didn’t help, isn’t innocent either. live DC work contractor federal government. know much they've trying control behavior everyday citizens businesses getting federal building around without mask on. Disinfectant sprayed touch points regularly. couple times day.

For matter can't enter public building DC, Maryland Virginia without proper personal protective equipment.

I see videos people trying shop without mask tried around customers would drag store. Nice try Gretchen.

But without 110% *enforcement* law authorities.....it's useless talk. NJ CT too. Life mostly back normal. Everyone's hitting beach, dining out, seeing friends family spikes recorded weeks... know, guess science actually works then, huh? 

Shame fucking idiots Florida dumb understand that. UK. Every time someone says covid deaths inflated point equivalent (ONS) shows actually there’s 20k deaths official figure average time year. Trump burn this. Thanks providing background info. far know green list list countries deemed safe people living Ireland travel *to* Ireland. Swedes indeed enter Ireland, US citizens anyone Europe. border UK open. passenger locator form arrivals say you’ll self isolating, enforced meaningful way. air controllers would like discuss you.... We're fucked honestly. happy though took week pleading press conference officially mandate masks. issue lot people enforcing them. usually exceptions misuesd. Like get medical condition prevents wearing mask safely. note doctor that. actual Dr. way least proof people think making up. also infringing rights document back claim? Cause lately everything country Same. Grew red area great conservative values. Today, end voting highly progressive policies punishing poor people doesn’t me.   definitely happen question significant factor causing death. One way determine whether lockdowns cause huge amounts deaths go state-by-state look number excess deaths covid-19 hard hit states like NY vs like Maine Washington. states stay home orders yet states actually lots covid-19 cases corresponding increases excess deaths. mean company claims contract virus source company's revenues? amazing suddenly contact tracing protects corporate revenue. Source??? Probably good time universal health care. Ya everything go price it. least get stuck $1.1m medical bill. I'm seeing people wearing masks nose taking altogether they're wandering isles. biggest problem half employees seem wear makes noses! 

There also honest confusion town. law says mom pop stores may decide masks themselves. walking downtown, shops mixed together. That's beds hospitals report open exist paper, reserved surge experiencing.

A bed staff proper equipment still bed reported open, indeed bed. hospital diverts patients, discharges early, increases many patients nurse doctor care suspend non-emergency treatment, overwhelmed. Claiming hospitals overwhelmed 100% capacity ludicrous; get 100% paper, triage. It’s another indicator beautiful economy, thanks *someone’s* bold, unprecedented actions. one side thats actively trying use way steal much tax payers money possible. parties pretty fucking shitty, one actively telling people die economy. sides. flu! stood me, too. max 100 attendees ""greatly limit"" numbers, must planning really big group. Ugh. Yeah, started lockdown completely letting go, lazy possible, eating junkfood every day, etc. gained pounds, eventually got sick myself. I'm following exercise program Pre-covid weight, probably taking care personal hygiene ever before. Funny works. locked like sanely managed countries. we're going screwed months. Same. used nicer person patience anymore. stupidity face 24/7. know earth globe 2,000 years still people denying it. Conspiracy theorists forever... Man remember telling wife wipe package got China back January starting. acted like crazy person. Seeing China literally lock people homes needed see know shit rails. median age death Covid significantly higher general population (without checking, 86 vs. 78 believe). 

Obviously many people would much younger otherwise healthier; time, lot people died care settings (and therefore lot overall total) would vulnerable flu well. 

The aim downplay risk young healthy, state even similar level overall risk individuals, may see excess mortality. literally believe hospitals get money Covid deaths.

According friend works pharmacist local hospital handling large number COVID patients, get paid treating COVID patients. record death COVID, get paid treating it.  guy needs start seeing glass half full! Think people never got Covid! Negative Nancy!

/s shit begins home. starts parents.  they're caring educating children rolls downhill get situations like this. Get new friends, pls. :) Same. want end bullshit money hungry asshole politicians risking life putting life hold. Blast. want ice cream 🍦 Gee that's bad. New England took sorts things seriously results within 24 hours. I'm you. local news interviewed asked give counties power shut us get control. skirts around question bullshit answer avoids answering directly. Let counties need something actually something. I'm sure every county Texas needs lock down. Let county decide give power so. 

South Padres still open business...party boats full, dolphin watch boat full, flea markets full, mud pit friend showed video packed...atvs trucks small concert looked like. Party boat owner interviewed pics came one wearing mask course say ""yes everyone board mask."" understand need make money...but c'mon look mess right now. Wife's uncle diagnosed needs go Hospital. small hospital easy see got filled right away.  man.. give hope sensible Finns. Sadly, Denmark uptick cases going around two weeks. huge worry *yet* good sign either: masks could helped this. think primary factors 'NPI fatigue', relatively cold July weather, letting many many countries (I think Finland's stricter criteria (8/100k vs 20/100k) wiser). I’m happy way district handling it. Virtual learning first 3 weeks choose want send child back campus strict sanitizing procedures, masks social distancing keep virtual learning platform. good tool breaking state getting sense what's happening  Yeah im angry opinion.

Man scroll tf read everything leave alone.

What kind fucking move that. Talk shit say calm bro.

Nobody town listens drs. Great. Good you. something one four americans I'm tired words ""herd immunity."" virus spreads interactions people. certain people become unable contract spread virus (due post-illness immunity, vaccine, wearing PPE, social distancing etc), spread virus slows.

""Herd immunity"" cliff virus going along fine 80% infected, dies suddenly. Every percentage increase people unable spread virus contributes slowdown. That's we've seen spread slow NY even though 10-25% coronavirus.

Furthermore, first % infected matter everybody else they're ones likely high number social interactions. slow spread going 0 10% immune going 70 80% immune.

So, population level, matter people able contract multiple times. people get immunity? long immunity last? That's matters. long people acquire immunity, there's herd immunity effect. hear even let bring See n' Say testing room. wonder last 5 questions stumpers! “Too long” = RepubLicans okay americans dying I’m Asia, even people could barely afford masks wearing them. also dangerous employees places. risk avoided simple shutdown. people travel order food locally, go restaurant eat it. prefer think number 1 rona truly idiot think senile creepy old racist win anything.

Yeah that's said, Trump's going lose. Easter, please stop calling Shirley. wait, sarcastic? guess known called 'riots'. Oh well, that's awkward. U.S. passport mean move wherever want world.

No one said that... assume people went process obtaining passport know does. mean think masks forever, since fauci says corona never go away? called liar. clip actually said. complete reference also look said originally border question believe last press conference journalist incorrectly quoted.  also sure article represents everything Norwegian expert actually said cause bit strange worded. friends saying good build immunity, stupid times like patients need turned away can't treat everyone? best turn away took proper precautions due others' selfishness, still got sick, best turn away without mask, social distancing, trying hardest get others sick? Speaking behalf horses everywhere, I’m offended. Nonetheless, seems like aren’t enough adjectives used describe Trump's awful behavior character. anyone ongoing list? supplies last average reported time infection death 18 days Europe, raw numbers would it. also delay reporting deaths varies place place. probably yet. Like wearing seat belt car insurance I'm really sure who's family think I'm putting risk. isolate 2 weeks going out. 2 weeks go all, even get groceries.

Part there's foreseeable end this. (northeast NYC area) went much bounced back somehow thought states would take cautionary tale. we're okay, dumpster fire everywhere else. timeline, say 3 months, 6 months, year, think could handle that. way states US general treating this, really think end. Even vaccine, many antivaxxers, really reach herd immunity? fLu!?!? Oh shit, get free pay $2 billion? Bargain!! Florida snowmen Georgia gotten bad. I’m travel nurse last couple days getting multiple calls/emails go Georgia crisis assignments (super high pay attract nurses immediately). weeks previous Cali, Arizona, Texas. wasn’t surprised see Georgia numbers catching irresponsible behavior. wonder happened to, ""it's worse flu."" Ignorance may bliss, denial made covid US disappear. 4% world's population, 30% current cases Covid-19. That's given. Home hospice thing provide pain medication. run it... Bonus points actually randomize one studies submit peer review Absolutely. Obesity Donald Trump's height (6'3"") [defined 6'3"", 240-pound people.

[Here picture Donald They're still trying turn profit. say right article discussing potential need two series vaccine. Covid19 could've gift Trump's reelection. done repeat usual platitudes unity strength hard times, point Fauci say ""Listen guy"". Covid would've largely contained he'd cruising towards reelection right now.

Exactly. Remember high Bush polling post 9/11? Strong leadership crisis gets everyone's blood up, even people disagree everything leader stands still back think he's good job maintaining united front face serious threat.

Trump... hasn't. think case best report outliers.

Ideally, done point scare people. Trump never job, really understand concept. likes spotlight show who's boss powerful way. point, think number would shock me. beyond screwed. ourselves. always tell people friend who’s dad died April they’re response “well didn’t cause that” yeah kinda did. We've 7 months plan prepare moment failed so.

Trump considers effort address virus personal affront republicans bent backwards prevent legitimate political position incoherent defective personality. short list:
- GDPR awesome
- Free movement awesome
- EURO really fun
- Competition lawsuits tech meh. Still EU light years ahead rest world regulating tech. I'm going throw there: teenagers parents guardians, fuck kids went partying pandemic? Biden launches initiatives day one 

Oh, guy doesn’t know yet. Biden doesn’t “initiatives” lol Well would good business decision. know he's incapable those, existence somehow antithetical them. aware headline often press little bit misleading. translated only.

Edit: 2 cents: promising approach tested monkeys. Good new understanding combat early speak ""breakthrough"". good new drug Candidates shown results wait successful tests humans. strategy? one says masks protect wearer. protect others infected wear masks. 

Additionally, could time CDC tried downplay mask wearing save supplies medical workers. 

Not saying intended imply conspiracy, conspiracy trump. You’re truly idiot think senile creepy old racist win anything. make fine NPC! family we're friendly recently took road trip water park - decided stop visit elderly (in 80's) grandparents. point, might well swing shotgun done it. kind huge bike thing Santa Clara week, monthly San Jose Bike Party... sure organizing chuckleheads weren’t using masks either virtually everyone county wearing nowadays.

I get wearing n95 physically active basic cloth masks? need stop babies mask up. Ohh yeah. They're likely around dying/dead people. easy area well. Re.pu.bli.cans said unlikely approve new don’t see need it,”** Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., told reporters Wednesday.

Honestly makes wonder bubonic plague-level disease they’d see need anything. hard understand... experts seem divided this.

Empirically speaking, countries appear fucked right southern emisphere, winter right now: South Africa South American countries. Australia, too, situation right seems serious months ago, summer there.

In northern emisphere, Canada Europe keep infections even Pakistan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia Bangladesh new infections seem going last weeks. again, countries northern emisphere either worsening show sign improving - United States, Mexico, several countries Central America, India.

Perhaps summer weather might indeed slowing spread virus, without eradicating it. Collective behaviour regarding masks, distancing etc also contributing difference. R.I.P Agent Orange would stop trying coin phrase, ""It is"" asked 140k+ Americans dead COVID 6 months. Hah! Well, think that's happening regardless anyone votes  Well, see laws rules mean nothing there's one enforce them... mean come maybe partied shore, isn’t reason cases spiking. It’s actually always Trump’s fault. cases mainly exploded opening indoor bars/restaurants protests. stay home don’t come contact me, won’t get virus then, simple vote either them. still matter choosing lesser two evils. He's probably referring TV show. Restaurant owners money ever manage put together normal job. lose business starve neither families. Sure, people work restaurants look new jobs, considering restaurants place heightens risk infection, also dangerous employees work environment.  Tease ""seven drugs"" never mentions them. 

Tested monkeys. Meh, chloroquine hydroxychloroquine worked monkeys too.  Well technically right sense article present new/useful information. agree general sentiment subreddit, I'm getting bit tired articles titled ""Fauci says '{insert obvious fact}'"".  Could? Oh sweet summer child.... girls who's fathers died asymptomatic transmission COVID back April? Yep. That's me. Choices consequences.  means let’s open schools raise new generation doctors scientists we’ll ignore next pandemic “freedumbs”. beyond frustrating. Thanks, hope better, soon. school? sure high school college students don’t hang parties? Viral load important severely virus affects you. longer exposure lead worse infections. attorney’s daughter town died age 25 respiratory failure testing positive week ago underlying conditions😢 they're better cared use hospital resources Well payroll tax cut trump says much used reason raid social security gets eventually scary measures effective Coronavirus protection. 

That's sum dangerous Coronavirus is. Fitting seeing prison slave labor come multiple times pandemic. need high rate infection test vaccine question someone knowledgeable. person long distance relationship, country (Sweden) could meet girlfriend (USA)? would like able return home after. Side note: hate pandemic. Rightfully so. Thanks sharing. Well move. immigration system EU. Plenty Americans done it. people claiming they’re true patriots really showed they’re nothing cowards big mouth past months. education levels overall GDP productivity indicator, I’d say definitely “smarter” FL. happened politicize mask wearing, believe science locked quick efficiently. I’ve never seen coordinated effort speed. 

The reason good place effective government handling (although think late, warning signs Baker decided take vacation instead, could MANY less deaths) people supposed to. also high proportion workers could easily work home etc..

I give credit people state. together knew do. 

I still won’t dine indoors though.. none friends either. want repeat April. Pro tip, ask ""no onions"" burger wearing mask longer Four million like it. people Agree. live away family one needed hospice care home, would fall brother, thus exposing us. 2to 64 power 40 million trillion Thanks. I’m 36, super political, genuinely embarrassed country. promise us level headed completely engulfed egos. Society runs two rivers, money purpose. Big money interests continued siphon cash flow economy river like stream. collective sense purpose danger too. important peaceful society. Instead hands job person puts religion way ahead science. muh diabeetus? Trump cares exactly one thing - Trump looking good possible exact moment he's in. Would look better week, month, admitted problem took stops solve it? Maybe. Probably. he'll look better *right now* problem, denial is!

This first problem can't covered new one week pesky bodies stop piling making news. China gets hammered every pandemic. worried then.

I noticed Spain Italy got hit. They're usually top stuff. prepared, prepared enough.

I've started stocking next ""wave"". We're still first wave, think COVID-19 done misery yet. I'm expecting food shortages next sweeps agricultural sector. rationing starvation, probably another month two like start pandemic spotty inventory stores buying whatever get, actually want. I’m confused arguing restrictions? Even president secretary education know restrictions  think safe say Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maryland, NYC area completed first wave wave recede. 

Louisiana place think could considered actually entering second wave. Nowhere else really saw much impact March-June. just....don't fucking sports right now.....athletes constantly getting covid defense socially distance? cant.....for everyones sake...cancel till goddamn vaccine... Anecdotally, know someone symptomatic received results 24 hours two weeks ago MD.

However, also heard lower priority tests (voluntary, non-referral, no-symptoms) put slower track \~ 7 days. interesting see difference opinions. know two brothers. One believes hoax people need get germs. wife works medical field says people's opinion totally change affects them. person talking wants go restaurants, doesnt wash hands, says lockdowns spread virus. go work, careful. union nothing compared NY. right work state. membership slightly 50%. Locally, great union leader Palm Beach County. overall, disappointed state union leadership. asshat Fox News suggested hospitals could use Coronavirus form revenue CARES act since gave hospitals money coronavirus deaths people latched onto fucking let go. Well guys, we’re going get bigger catapult/Trebuchet there’s long line people ready get launched Mitchs window first thought older people childfree back day childfree offspring give zero fucks. children die, suggest closing schools till magically disappears?
Disclaimer: won’t. agree hope vaccine end 2021 year everyone get one. I’m betting life start getting back normal 2023. mask don’t go outside unless it’s necessary then. would hate live pessimistic world view without hope **2017 Cause Deaths US (deaths per day):**

PSYCH! actually got tiny bonus already taken back talking triage things covid, taking account hospitals ICUs full, isn’t make sense illnesses? try justify anti-mask stance pretending somehow people simply able use properly, go sick, ignore NPIs, etc. There's evidence this, they're making whole cloth. *entirely* correct point goes directly ""personal responsibility"" narrative they've used justify softer NPIs. logic consistency never FHM's strong suits, unfortunately. addressing disease severity (symptoms).

“We showed multi-institutional study reason believe certain ABO blood type lead increased disease severity, defined requiring intubation leading death,” said senior study author Anahita Dua, HMS assistant professor surgery Mass General.

“This evidence help put rest previous reports possible association blood type higher risk COVID-19 infection mortality,” Dua said. bet desantis trying best suppress numbers even still look bad  is. expression Doom Gloom. There's even songs it.

But Merriam-Webster says ""did mean Gloom Doom?"" search Doom Gloom whatever. Probably reason Korean baseball teams put dolls stands. they'd actually care record number cancer deaths guarsntee they're close surpassing number talked patient yesterday got test around time girlfriend (around July 8th so) CVS. Neither gotten results yet. Biden huge lead, going change minds point? Thanks sympathy! Wish position. It's...not great States right now, that's sure. Dunno country live in, happen states. thing common knowledge states. **under** two? zero chance could keep mask two year old. even like 10 seconds. :(

Edit: see article contradicts itself. one place says ""only kids two"" wear mask another place everyone ""over two"" wear mask. Two year olds exist paradoxical limbo wear mask. Thanks making clear, article writer. ""Karen Friends Beads"" 

I'd speaking manager changing name soon, Karen... Ah yes, another term rotted  subtext violence America close coming socially unglued decades. That's happens decades policies intended push people brink financially set other.  Specifically Fauci done contribute number? He's largely ignored WH. Yes. significant increase number excess deaths everywhere. county 10% it’s previous worst day. 

Confirms customer nurse told day. 1000 yard stare. president united states wants call him, sounds like news Keep close eye dip 95%, go hospital immediately go 90%. it’s important establish baseline first. people may natural saturation around 95% due pre-existing conditions. general you’re 90% need haul ass hospital 200,000 air controllers Florida? aware air traffic controller history. really impressive considering work high skill. 

I think problem getting 200,000 people Florida willing work garbage pay Although I'm surprised one bit certain section population dick stop spread, really disappointed government reckless selfish. Really hoping new leadership better education help avoid future. Oh muricans!! fail surprise. could limit ability transmit disease public reduce transmission testing capacity built up/restored...perhaps could start mandating masks closing indoor dining bars? Closing gyms? Limiting gatherings?

/The real sad part poor choices southern states affecting nationwide testing capacity. state proactive got cases control longer stay open safely national backlog tests results slow useful. Seriously. point like asking water wet. Kinda feel like thats inportant question receive answer want determine impact policy Disagree, concentrated amount control, easier maintain lockdown. reason largest countries (sans Canada) seen biggest outbreaks. India, Brazil, Russia, US, China etc. numbers correct, China done great job still never locked whole country unreasonable county large, instead jumped hot spots, perhaps provinces size Germany. large country full lockdown, unreasonable, areas different others. Still, US jumping hot spots locking regions Clinical covid thing see hospital. Patient displays signs symptoms, tests negative everything else also tests negative covid. Eloquent fuck. 😷 Goya. Well, trump busy trying please white racists, Chinese, Russians trying make money... it’s like trying date three girls once. Yeah probably stayed home went big lavish Jake Paul style party pharaoh threw palace shit. “stay home smear fuckin BLOOD door people stay fuck away home cuz you’re putting BLOOD like crazy person.” sister flew bachelorette party one hardest hit states, flew back 64 year old Mom pick airport.  ¯\\\\\_(ツ)\\\_/¯ making vaccine best business plan would sell low cost possible get PR comes long company ""saving world pandemic."" would guarantee sorts future contracts opportunities. understanding Pfizer wants sell vaccine $20 per dose far lower cost annual flu vaccine. case wedding (and wedding, people, marriage, etc.) wonderful, beautiful idea, stunning. Great family tradition, inspiration others.

The Queen got married still rationing fabric, etc. took heart. even makeup wedding day. woman total boss! going say thing... people instigating fights asinine representations human race. pull guns shops require shoes allow smoking? 

This prime example critical thinking encouraged children. Oh, bad, totally thought serious first. 2018-2019 flu season, total 477 estimated deaths among age 18. 17/18: 643, 16/17: 251, 15/16: 268, 14/15: 803.

So prior 5 flu seasons, America averages 488 child deaths per year influenza.

Keeping mind course influenza burden product fully-open society.

In case COVID-19, children pretty well insulated far. Schools closed spring, daycares closed, currently summer.

For instance, California, children age 5 make 7.3% population 1.8% confirmed COVID-19 cases; total children age 18 make 27.3% population 8.7% confirmed COVID-19 cases.

So schools open, children going much higher risk exposure. cases influenza, estimated number symptomatic infections among children matches almost exactly share population (27% infections, 26% population).

Long story short, yes, *as right now* children die annually influenza died past ~4 months COVID-19. remains seen whether hold true next 8 months. skeptical. *coronas Hi ny

Wait till 900!  university's given up. Blaming republicans bullshit heavily Democrat institutions totally ignore CDC's advice social distancing masks replacement staying home, decide start classes anyways. precautions they've taken farce (e.g. Putting 30 people 30-seat classroom seats 1.5 feet apart apparently ""social distancing""), people going get sick die, university take zero blame. university run psychopaths consistently track record putting profit ethics, even coronavirus, even though brand image ""Catholic"" ""Non-Profit"". Teaching us virtues ""sacrifice"" ""helping common man"" bullshit putting people's lives danger. I'm planning cancelling in-person meetings club indefinitely, feel like there's much else do. Trump said best idk believe help ""YOU SHALL PASS"" shouted melting iceberg correct, it’s USA. selfish bastards world wide. 145,000 examples morning? ""That's wear underwear. Things gotta BREATHE"" Testing ceiling. see well first graph here, especially flip logarithmic view:  Yes, even worse indoors. Imagine somebody Corona sneezes hand. touches chairs, tables, doors etc. everybody touches whatever sick person got contact his/her face afterwards gets it, too.

Corona infects (as far know) via droplets. masks help lot protests lead many infections could have.

EDIT: Mounting evidence however suggest Corona airborne well increases infection rate doors even more. Emergency building hospitals nothing unless coupled suppression virus stop cases going up. possible build hospitals fast enough contend exponential growth. Texas suppressing virus situation get worse worse.  I’m surprised think political/social affiliations attached employment status 30m people work.

What things think 30m people common? ""The study find, however, symptomatic individuals blood types B AB Rh positive likely test positive COVID-19, blood type less likely test positive. ""

So new study dispel previous ones all, precise.

Still, hope average journalist write does. already killed people US flu past 100 years. .....did teachers actually go college grab diploma inside crackerjack box????? don’t give people incentive change, never will. governments mentioned actually pay businesses stay closed. happening US.

People gotta work make ends meet cater young college partiers. lot depends location situation. school opened up, I’d go back. According Mathmatica COVID death calculator, get infected, 0.003% chance dying everyone household less 0.1% dying. Schools closed protect students protect communities. want generation sacrifice educational future communities, need certain benefits communities need support students. Given horrible virtual school run, communities support us. school going back virtually, lack support needs change. want protect vulnerables use protection like masks? oh thank god post office secure 82 million people America don’t back wearing masks pansy that’s killed 140,000 them. 

That’s lot idiots Oh yeah. increase cases sounds like bars restaurants sure. mean gyms low risk though. think lot data yet, intuitive understand. good articles showing statistics studies movement virus low population rural areas small-towns?

I live rural county Kansas numbers stayed low, also surrounding counties. deaths hospitalizations. many people truly believe political hoax get it, bad. Yesterday, Board Education overrode governor postponed school year Labor Day (usually begins time August 10). left school district decide open back up.

Showing people numbers articles cases deaths highly populated areas waste time. 

What sources could post even Facebook say---Yes, even rural, low population, low impact virus yet, need maintain social distancing masks?  

Our local school board emergency meeting tonight decide earliest possible date August ready open back up... Right, tough position need project confidence admissions doesn’t fall much need person classes support athletics there’s fucking chance university able avoid infections. Texas, nursing homes quarantined, lots current future deaths going come nursing homes turned away hospitals.   No, definitely shouldn’t. would make anything way worse already frankly it’s already horrendous. Don’t know, drownings, car accidents, heart attacks. saying COVID get money! know that’s relatives FL telling me. /s  *Heavy Sarcasm* People could chosen wear mask, social distance

I'm convinced point wear masks wash fucking hands go back 90-95% normal. early study China (I believe) showed household transmission married couples occurred 30% time. I’m sure follow studies that, seems like case isn’t strange. Anecdotally, know guy tested positive live-in girlfriend tested negative. Man it’s kinda crazy country still restrictions life feels less back normal way little now. covid peak lockdown feels like distant bad dream. haven’t really thinking covid haven’t checking news it...

Then come see states STILL middle covid deep water. shocked much, feel like guy chilling country house civil war going field km away. I’m really sorry Americans who’ve deal high coronavirus levels long, stay strong realize Florida everything backwards child’s school (NY) opening masks all, social distancing strict “stay home literally symptoms anything” policy. know works keep people safe. I’m little confused none arguments floating around. don’t understand discussion isn’t centered get kids back school safely, rather idea send back look exactly like before. recognize space staffing issues many schools seems put amount effort finding creative solutions problems going back forth issue general, we’d able figure out. said, can’t attend safely, staff students, can’t ethically send them. get sick, able to. somewhat misleading, read NYT actual number *between 2x 13x reported number, state state basis. 13x total US reported cases. 

But obviously one real idea... China has. dancing glee like King George seems 8,3 table provide. differs countries. Higher country due better public health.

Pu question statistics authority want best answer.

And life expectancy number years left live average someone x years today. It’s question aren’t doing. people downvoting person asking question? thing friend discussing covid kept going back tests masks ane everything else eventualy stoped talking wouldnt explain excess deaths abnormal value... hope politicians remain uninterested anything.

Because political issue.

It's health issue.

The health system completely broken. capacity pandemic, terror attack, etc. people seem care enough demand health system retain capacity.

I went emergency room 2016 waited 6 hours seen nurse (not doctor), got one shot pain killer told leave. excrutiating pain spine completely fractured, explained multiple times accident in, jam packed people get everyone nearly dead emergency room. 

The system so, broken.

Our lack quality education ultimately brought country knees. 1000 day... Get country blame invade (looking Chinaaaahhhh). report CT value There's lot people understand seems let flight BCN NYC, alluding believe name i.d (driver's license) matched passport. refund either. $1600 student, book another expensive flight another airline get NYC. That's alot money throw away. 🤬 Same. hoping Houston stupid I'm proven wrong everyday. want get too. 

TMC making ""essential"" workforce come back hot mess I'm happy it. get started fudging data.  point force air go material. point catch large droplets, spray 6 feet. 

Again, wear glasses know cloth mask sends air glasses.

They perfectly flowing valve Eventually land ""nobody could've predicted this."" toddlers aren’t going wear masks anybody else? couple months it'll ""George Soros killed uncle paid doctor blame coronavirus.""

How much natural herd immunity population determine corona disease affects, says Professor Gunnar Kvåle.

Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell believes Sweden better Norway possible new wave infections autumn people immune there. stated press release Tuesday, claim met opposition, including [Norwegian] National Institute Public Health.

Professor emeritus international health, Gunnar Kvåle, believes starting point claim wrong.


- like talk come ""wave"". term comes theory fighting flu, return ""waves"". facing completely new pandemic, politics decides whether let new ""wave"" come back, Kvåle tells Dagbladet.

- also know little epidemic able say come autumn. political decisions determine develops, natural waves, says.

- think us go?

- largely us, context skeptical opened many countries now, infection countries open closer Norway's level. allow infection return, turn increase infection pressure Norway.


That people immune covid-19 parts Sweden Norway, believes Tegnell right.


- Tegnell others suggest high prevalence antibodies among population Stockholm area, true higher Oslo parts Norway. know whether antibodies detected provide lasting protection, unlikely reach level according theory needed create herd immunity.

- matter Tegnell goes says Norway?


- **No, think matters much. people say much credibility area now**, Kvåle believes.


- seem unfortunate Sweden leads less emphasis infection control measures there, adds - continues:


- Herd immunity, many think one goal, since large serious consequences many people. means probably many around 60 per cent population must infected, many become ill die, see Sweden, long herd immunity achieved.


- Better equipped


- think situation Sweden Norway autumn?


- believe worse Norway Sweden. Time works us. likely find vaccine, gain knowledge better treatment, infection flares again, better equipped.


- vaccine ready, means possible difference immunity, professor believes.


He also believes Norway may better equipped Sweden handle new outbreaks.


- infection detected here, good system testing, infection tracking, isolation follow-up contacts, probably better Sweden following up. Sweden overloaded deaths; major burden health care. Fortunately, number infections declining Sweden, still many infected Norway. sense, better situation able follow individual cases.


He believes outbreak Bergen weekend, three people diagnosed infection, including person associated Håkonsvern, confirms claim.


- take care situation, follow individual cases - track many contacts, says.



- Uneasy new wave infection Bergen

- serious

Another success factor Norway made us manage ""beat down"" epidemic quickly managed reduce infection rates reached peak March, according professor.

- Many countries Europe managed reduce numbers quickly, says.

- Norway manage it?

- think saw seriousness early enough. government came scene quite quickly strongly, think seriousness broke Norwegian population. People understood dramatic, many scared, Kvåle answers.

He adds:

- Fear necessarily good, situation, led us taking epidemic seriously. seriousness became clear Norway. Sweden. took epidemic lightly star epidemic.


- still scared?


- No, probably scared now. that's good, many also unnecessarily scared. afraid take infection control rules seriously.


With low infection rates Norway now, also need afraid, according Kvåle:


- must know over, risk flare-up there. especially important open borders whole Europe. must aware pressure infection greater many countries, protect us - preferably bandages prevent infection - public transport many gathered. lot done without us afraid, says professor.


Dagbladet sent number questions Norwegian Directorate Health related Tegnell's statements. questions answered. There's reason call zoomers. Damn even notice, seen subs googled provide link. sub sounds like trash problem is, teachers' unions accustomed getting shit figuring deal it, actually organizing getting strike nearly impossible.

What point union stand members **and get results**? But, lot teachers used getting stomped on, try push it.

Too many teachers martyr complex. Teachers need start treating teaching job, ""calling"" ""life mission"" romantic sounding term. Right that’s thought. Unfortunately road leads censorship state. IMO specific things sensored internet, start applying subjective standards like suggesting gets really easy blur line go far.

People, even content creators entitled opinion, even disagree it. associating content conflicting viewpoints users view sort debate make informed decision sides. would think individual states would follow lead northeast lock states regardless feds think.

The states reopened early never really closed totally missed chance part want offend Trump base. northeast really influential Trump base offend, much local political resistance.  Taken CDC.gov

Several governors little nothing, continue same.

I think inaction hailed positive thing either.

That inaction beginning demand heavy toll. Heavier even trying right thing.

It called 'novel' coronavirus 'new'; medical establishment still know long-term effects. Mistakes made, continue made. History provides long list mistakes become lessons things repeated. Exactly!!!
I deleted many friends high school I'm exhausted arguing anything. Maybe put hot weather body Agreed. much disinformation/propaganda Facebook, unregulated. 90% see days ads, posts friends. Unfortunately it’s main means communication many distant family members, reason haven’t deactivated account. source says long person treated Covid get funding say hospitals get funding Covid deaths (unless missed part) think worth noting uncommon even flu. Getting accurate numbers slam dunk. gluten free chessboard There's people Facebook saying exaggerating bad got New York believe hospitals ever close full anyone dying. time footage hospitals news still coming Italy say since footage Italy couple news stories CNN ran whole thing must made up.

Fucking morons, idiots need get bad dose Covid STFU.

And news media social media also blame much goddamn misinformation dummies eat up. little excuse given media Facebook used say virus serious. Knuckleheads. plain stupid justified using FEAR tool. Trump would get along well. changed way compiles COVID-19 statistics presenting figures directly comparable countries Europe. country’s previous system (incuding active old, inactive infections), Iceland ranked close Spain UK number cases diagnosed (mostly border). new system, showing number new active infections diagnosed per 100,000 population past 14 days, puts Iceland close bottom European table, alongside Estonia, Norway, Hungary. two active coronavirus infections per 100,000 people Iceland past two weeks. end scale, Luxembourg recorded 173.2 active cases per 100,000 people Sweden 48.7.

Interesting using another way compiling stats before. makes sense standardized, one lowest infection burdens region.   Damn. Impactful comment. Powerful perspective. don’t know enforce masks kids 5. I’ve tried 3.5 yr old it’s really futile. Maryland healthcare workers (ones know least) able get results back within 24 hours problem masks good protecting good protecting yourself. guess go well american mind set, people dont wear them. I'm sorry loss. Never said aren’t helpful. point valved masks helpful Japanese human. get tired taking precautions while. scary thing heat slow spread since folks outdoors more. going get lot worse.

The even scarier thing long incubation time delay infection death (2-4 weeks) - short term memory working us. IDK, war great way get economic depression. person receives treatment anything dies, hospital get reimbursement treatment claiming person Covid, treatment received counted treatment Covid, regardless actually treated for.

This happens increase Covid death count byproduct fudging Covid treatment numbers. There's also living person dispute claim treated person Covid, making easier cover investigation occur.  nuns suffered saved. So? sporting events watched home, yet insist bringing fans. Pfft.. live here. Almost everything ""takes long"", medical testing.

Compared places country, would say yes, testing southern states (MS example), takes long. Way long. sorry loss. would require paying poor people's medecine health care. bourgeoisie class stoop moral obligation stupid. Japan way fewer cases countries closed reopened. would closing changed anything?

Japan's current experience shows fragility relying voluntary behaviour people. People get tired taking precautions while. need enforce behaviours want. Maybe better draw Pictures make comic air fox. Unless hit dreaded 6,000-8,000 day deaths, I'm sure ever sink them. good stuff, i'm back using 'lead' think say you’re feeling well lists bunch coronavirus symptoms advises get tested etc, useful it’s something Troll. Possibly Israeli, probably Russian. 
FHM made *incredible* amount errors authorities position. one even remarkable calculations *already* [corrected once]( corrected **again**. It’d funny weren’t ridiculous. Yes, everyone makes mistakes time time, FHM Swedish authorities made [so many errors like this]( it’s indicative sloppy, careless work. memorable predicted would 4 6 million covid-infected residents Stockholm county, population 2.4 million lol, sigh.

Like one, one passed sniff test, least scenario 0 predicted ~200 deaths September 1, 2021 revised additional 1,108 deaths then. Seriously, it’s absurd: people can’t get away consistently sloppy jobs way less importance this!

To quote [Swedish person megathread]( means probability large amount errors one knows well. seen often software development, many obvious simple errors, sure lot ""shit"" hidden surface.

Yep, see tip iceberg errors almost undoubtedly. It’s sad Sweden’s technocrats, hold inordinate amount power due crisis, incredibly. incompetent. It’s even sadder majority Swedish people (according polls) still support dangerous incompetence. Oh, wish wrong.. glad took father, learned capitalism=bad young I’m able/willing take annual flu shot due autoimmune issues (flu shot + undiagnosed egg allergy = autoimmune disease = flu shots me) BUT, forevermore, ill (cold, flu) must go (dr appt, pharmacy), wear mask. aware - - simple act protects others... others worth protecting. actually opted French nationality 18, born, raised lived time.

/s plan never ""destroy curve"", always ""flatten curve.""

Yes, plan made assumption virus contagious was. turned possible bring curve compeltely, countries did. 

There reason assume inevitably explode. future given. vaccine medicine could real end pandemic. Like said, extremely diseases ever spread around world meaningful sense cause herd immunity. 1918 flu didn't. 2009 didn't, even though given free reign spread around world one enacted meaningful restrictions. Yet hte highest estimates said infected 1,4 billion people, around 20% global population. 

Aiming ""herd immunity"" global even national scale sense complete wild goose chase. simply pandemics end looking historically. one end infect half humanity. likely simply become part season flu, hopefully working vaccine. Trying attain herd immunity happens needlessly throwing lives away.  Elections still consequences.

If Biden carries Texas come November Hegar wins flip 7 8 house seats, Texas GOP going know who's blame. Yes, agree usa system far behind response, people also capable inform protect never depend government fix everything lives. absolutely believe intense lockdown could decimated virus

Look northwards eastwards longer belief. countries slowly opening infections restricted localized hotspots. wearing one Covid.

I contact anyone unless I'm wearing mask. wear n95 can't give anyone (I contact anyone catch it) someone can't give me.

A n95 mask stopped spread. Took test July 2nd Oklahoma. Still results. work ICU. shortages druogs used sedate people. Granted, might local thing, telling us national shortages due surge NE places. anecdotal evidence admit could wrong Ya sorry say it. trash supports trump supports Walmart Walmart going cut throat enforcing shit. mask mandate state stricter one country. Walmart cool paying fine vs telling trash mask up. living someone who's already respiratory failure COVID-19, odds infected well. Hopefully household recovered asymptomatic person care them, going brutal. Well said Texans: MeSs TeXaS   
SARS-CoV-2: *Hold beer* thought New Yorkers ""real Americans""

Same thing happened Wuhan.  “Doctor he’s dying Covid”

Don’t listen “Leaders” say testing problem. BIG problem! five months pandemic still issues capacity. really ""Ongoing Adjective List Dingleberry"" ticker keeps going every day. Similar US Covid-19 tally. could check day see many 1000's new words aptly describe incompetance. Business always able determine they'll serve reasons?

Often, even *want* eat timeframe. 0,000001% isn’t 0%. It’s safe majority children.  Nobody gets Mr. Covid's wild ride Person right. country, bending taking hot dickings muttering much discontent towards government. countries starting see trend goes far beyond Trump, American culture. culture worship guns lives, streets people. culture treat neighbors like enemies, feel exact position life. 

With regulations, people wonder 100x gun deaths countries per year. probably type school shootings, student walks rifle shotgun take many possible killing themselves. 

Sorry say, looking less less likely America deserves saved, even possible. We're worst enemies. quite ambiguous. original report I've seen stated study done New Delhi, nominally small district larger city Delhi. guy can: Minors true disabilities preventing wearing mask would held standard. is, masks even recommended children age 2 due higher risk choke mask. Even ever policy place refuse care anti-mask wearer, would exceptions, children would definitely category. 

Technically, health care facilities currently right refuse care patients reason deemed fit healthcare system. system designed turn away patients, exclude patients may endanger patients staff. exception EMTALA, require patients presenting needed healthcare receive care. applies emergency rooms emergency-based services. course simple explanation, medico-legal nuances.

I agree right healthcare human right. However, also feel people also ability forfeit right choices could cause harm others healthcare environment. doesn’t mean receive care laws place protect US citizens this. real issue emergency departments capacity patients nowhere else turn (known many EDs “Code Black”). stark reality people vocally declare loudest refusal wear mask follow precautions usually first come receive care promptly demand it. Even treated healthcare staff/providers plead take precautions protect others, brush need knowing always able return ED care (at least expecting this). Even worse, many people also Medicare/Medicaid, even paying thousands owed ED treatment, many hospitals eat cost covered insurance. people opposed ACA/Obamacare. 

As healthcare provider, Im never going refuse care someone needed, especially since 99.9% patients 18 under. But, things see daily basis make going work day difficult. disheartening see others little empathy decency others won’t follow simple precautions. sad see people honestly ignorant importance precautions instead follow words politicians medical experts regarding issue. hope continue pushing taking time every family talk right precautions, finding positive messages help families see importance precautions rather making feel like lectured ordered something reality minor inconvenience. states taking seriously. Yeah wtf, makes look like world missing good portion cases.

The total reported 1.5m India!  Sadly medical professionals heads mass 2009 idea would caught world would different place right now. Fully agree ! Choose friends wisely virus seeks stupid. person came Emergency Room wearing mask, clutching chest, saying, “I can’t breathe! can’t breathe!” would keep mask on? 

If not, not? Americans need get fucking grip, father works hospital caught it, said worst thing he's ever still felt effects months recovering, got bad made sure life insurance sorted thought going die. shit putting country selfish grown children throwing temper tantrum piece material face. fair, US good president charge would worked fine, much better medical infrastructure Latin American country. think America's system failure, least Covid, rather rulers relevant portion citizens.

Venezuela surviving can, completely different situation. infections US healthcare system makes many people, especially younger adults, unable afford preventative care medical issues, making overall population less healthy. Healthcare rural areas also sparse, leading overall lack care, making care covid difficult. pandemic US strongly affecting rural populations, March mostly urban.

As result lack healthcare general, US adults also tend shrug medical issues, less likely seek early care. family describes suddenly declining overnight, likely warning signs missed. really, initially let in, would track make sure you’re staying longer you’re allowed mean there’s many people wouldn’t work. it’s Canada they’re super nice stereotypes wasn’t fan G-Dubya I’d welcome back open arms right now... called liar.

Which quite incivil, since responded point pointing interpretation Tegnell said widespread Norway done discussing you. feel like responding people engage incivility. Depends what’s treated? Wtf r y’all man get ur shit together. hope u guys r staying safe Protesting thousands, shoulder shoulder. Definitely preventing covid  don’t speak Canadians, lot resentment anger towards America Americans right now. Trump done lot damage think unified country America. 

We may sorts still friends trump leaves 2024 things never us. start use smaller smaller timeframes denote amounts cases hopes people briefly scan think bad anymore, need question morality. Isn’t moving towards students online learning? least near term end summer Fall months? Probably bigger factor play selfish idiots running around wearing masks.  make really good money job doesn’t transfer well. Also kid. wish thought move 20. could planned education career better. people charge gonna stop listening useless president start actually something? can’t stop governors mayors making rules. does, arbitrarily breaks laws; delay litigation forever.

And “own rules” mean start penalizing people following guidelines. There's freedom money bro. That's money guys working right McDonald's. there? Genuinely curious. 

Do source link? really hope better (in terms deaths per capita) others due young population, figures make sense. anyways, fingers crossed India families Indian coworkers, hope stay safe. note: number limited actual spread virus. we're measuring here, deliberately crippled testing capacity. Honestly, man, anecdote own: get test. can.

Because here's thing, March, since fever, candidate testing country, capacity anything first responders long term care time. time testing opened April, well past it.

Eventually, 4 months later, got government's antibody test basically came back ""it kinda looks like it... definitely maybe. *some kind coronavirus, least*.""

And that's i've got. I'll never definitive answer. immune? risk strokes later life one take seriously definitive result file? 

Get tested. hassle, understand, maybe America's equipped anything either way, worse never know. light this, I've made petition reinstate CDC primary handler Covid-19 data. also need stop suppressing data know what's going on.

Whitehouse Till death us part. Yeah don’t get Trump hasn’t realized fucking federal government officials organize good national response would thousands times better reelection whatever fuck tried. crazy we’ve known almost week 2 masks lockdowns way go nobody wanted admit nobody could tell wear mask fed bungled stockpiling supplies. difficult wealthiest nation world get enough fucking cheap cloth masks population short amount time. Allowing Kushner basically pirate states purchased supplies god knows another big fuck didn’t need happen. 

He really fire experts Obama’s name sewn undies didn’t know expertise needed. Literally exercise Trump expecting face consequences bad decision. Whats worrying isn’t listening Fauci, would listen team officials organized Obama. 

Then course R’s made sure enrich friends scummy supply contracts PPP loans meant small businesses going large corporations. course self serving angle, incompetence angle plays large roll well.  They're probably already close, use excess death stats.  interstate system also created intense borders people animals difficult time crossing. create pollution nightmare decreases life expectancy people living near them. stress create every day big cities unquantifiable imo significant. kill many animals, insects, etc. dangerous, sure less crashes produce gruesome deadly crashes.

Oh stretched population people live far everything would argue that's harmful community. really respiratory virus

that dangerous thing say.  competent dictators there, 90% dictatorship stupid. Sorry...Canada full. Fix country fuck mine up. you? stay home, use curbside pickup delivery groceries, watch netflix alone 24/7 ever socialize zoom, can’t get virus people stop willing let captain drive new boats since keeps crashing boats. goes looking around finds one give boat sketchy Russian guy. gets boat pretends boat completely legit American source. fair, majority people take long process things. US like playing Plague easy... Yeah definitely losing offer perspective ""denier"":

It's skepticism denial. daily positive case count rising past month, right around testing became prevalent. Many people using rising case numbers mean doom, others looking death counts declaring doom. all, we're still arriving accurate mortality rate COVID, that's primarily matters, infection rate. comparison, people catch strain coronavirus year, accompanying mortality rate negligible, meaning lifestyle changes unnecessary vast majority people.

If we're told deaths occur 2-3 weeks infection, skeptics waiting 2-3 weeks trusting positive case numbers meaningful. otherwise, rise would simply we're testing more, means asymptomatic COVID cases existed since earlier year. would lower mortality rate significantly.

In light recent evidence, imagine many skeptics changed tune. know am. denial, ""show data"". That's say need see bodies believe something true, going change lifestyle halt economy much, better good reason. still easy stuff like wear mask socially distance without hard evidence, course.  literally wrong.  group different teacher. Otherwise common vector groups infect through. favorite restaurant People won’t things except threat law seems. It’s American thing.

It's law Toronto, yet see people indoors without masks time.

The impactful thing protesters could combat issue, pay close attention police town. care much, care enough look records local police - names, histories.  Call abuses past.

Doctors front lines going record saying prescribing hcq/azt orders filing formal protests. Trump touted ""game changer"" pieces place declare victory solved pandemic incredible business deals.

Meanwhile, Trump refused take responsibility lockdowns, completely hands-off making *single* public statement favor lockdowns, delegating everything governors saying ""state issue"". formal guidance whatsoever lock every state inconsistent. However moment progress appeared, massively pressured every state end lockdown quickly possible. enough states fell line became impossible (and pointless) governor maintain it. massive swindle make people blame state governors loss jobs quality life, thank Trump restoring everything normal.

It's almost like gigantic con position Trump hero saved us time election, timing 6 months off. makes wonder massive miscalculation Trump campaign team (not one scientist among them) completely underestimated rate virus would resurge. love top comments get derailed stupid jokes almost every serious thread. spread still big decrease vaccine comes? Assuming many people get it, virus would stop spreading, less hosts, eventually die off, right? Comedian podcaster Brendan Shaub co host Bryan Callen caught covid. first question Brendan’s doctor asked political leanings are. asked doctor said allot people don’t want take HCQ Trump pushed actually works really well. took fine days. co host didn’t still sick 2 weeks later last heard. something found interesting. Downvote away 👍 people stick science. know Americans supposed ignore sticknto whatever hype popular moment I’m positive (would creep post history) may one posts made go looking MS hospital news specifically. dumb. He's spineless, boot- licking coward. Much worse.

I'm coastal Mississippi. We. Are. Fucked. thinking Trix. come going hospital? 18 days NE FL I'm emotional all, I'm tired reading justification shitty behavior claiming politicized. Weak people look scapegoats. face comment perfect example, hypocritical Trump changes stance Masks, scientific Fauci it? That's politicization Borderline? 

His extra long ties disguising girth :-)  It’s measuring contest. It’s saying shit happens happen airline. grateful situation wasn’t worse. dunno man. shocking we're well are. St. Marks starting get packed weekends pretty big crowds outdoor bars sidewalks around there. daytime, I'd estimate mask wearing 99% Friday Saturday nights yuppies pretty careless I'd call 50%. We're fairly safe much virus state anymore, suseptible outbreak inoculated bunch people returning Florida.

I'd thrilled Cuomo imposed strict state borders turned cars away. kind depressing may inadvertently fail way end-around success achieves goal lower legal illegal immigration numbers (hopefully, temporarily) making US unappealing place eyes world. Perspective 2,000 people died two days. far ""an uncrowded beach low risk."" Yes, possible go things way that's unlikely get sick.

But inability people country stay fuck home possible wear mask can't already caused tens thousands preventable deaths, sign slowing. seem like problem you, making life choices increase chances catching disease spreading someone else, yes, selfish. Every single American city: cities Spain: probably many more..  Maybe put inside body Bruh chill out. comment isn’t completely irrelevant. someone 20's who's appendix burst extensive knee injury requiring multiple surgeries, sounds terrifying. I've walked right paid exactly zero. also read almost sick leave either, also boggles mind. 1 month appendix burst 6 weeks first knee surgery, 3 weeks second one, happened within year. Can't imagine losing income simultaneously getting medical bills well. getting screwed sides fault own! course not; would require pulling heads sand. Opening schools isn’t problem. It’s way country handled pandemic far.

These things mutually exclusive...

Because we've handled pandemic poorly, opening schools would throwing gasoline fire  Assuming death concern Drugs mentioned one mentioned study:

Ralimetinib

ARRY-797

gilteritinib

Apilimod

MAPK13

silmitasertib

SB203580

dinaciclib

Wording one Study: tested 68 drugs compounds found antiviral activity several FDA approved, clinical testing, preclinical development various diseases, including silmitasertib (CK2, phase 2), gilteritinib (AXL, FDA approved), ARRY-797 (p38, phase 2/3), MAPK13-IN-1 (p38, preclinical), SB203580 (p38, preclinical), ralimetinib (p38, phase 2), apilimod (PIKFYVE, phase 1), dinaciclib (CDK, phase 3), among others Guess wait see 2020 excess death count. Wondering spin that? Come Jamaica know stupid ass move. guys island easily prevent anyone coming in. Update:

* *All* current candidates require multiple doses
* Efficacy estimated 50% think best case early vaccine marginal effect crisis. Worst case, effect negative effect. prove anything, I'm telling happened, went dinner said found mom face down, tried revive her, phone paramedics telling CPR, paramedics left cops hung around body picked up, I'm sure didnt throw last tid bit make juicy story.. went personal doctor due diligence changed. Lemme go ask doctor reports you. Ok. voting fascist assholes.  Somehow think wealthy parents that. message: ""See, money keep safe little people."" True, people teaching credentials, lots teaching experience, windfall imo. say situation, all.

9/11 took everyone surprise. instantly created huge shock every americans, lasted day. Bush really much do, everything happened even aware life started itself. shops, restaurants everything else opened next days country. Bush ride wave, proactive.

Meanwhile Trump actually take decision whole time, that's able fail miserably. decision effect crisis even called like that. People already looking decision whole thing actually happened.

Trump take decision back February, important thing ? Stopping dicease threat moment tank economy, save economy hope dicease actually spread. Bush never take sort preemptive decision, nothing matter life death americans.

His role purely act like he's something. Whiole Trump actually shit tons things, he's absolutely unable them. It’s good PR. don’t want gouge people disease that’s making headlines. fuck people nobody notice. That’s vulture capitalism 101. Sneaky square eyed fuckers, always knew goo. is, full circle. idiocracy real 100% believe advisors told returned briefings different ""tone"" (as media reports it). imagine told him: Read word word, lose

But steps rake wishing Maxwell ""well"". 

However, continues continues suggest ridiculous things like injecting disinfectant, numbers rise, unfortunately. getting N95 masks? need work available. Oh well, guess breath carcinogenic grinding dust welding fumes time being.  explain mean? read seemed one person saying reason issue America due politics, someone else responding case places, way they've dealt put teeth behind rule. Without that, everyone, even most, would've done right. Sweden took notes US apparently. That’s shame one stabile countries. expected better that. American usually look towards Sweden envy. Fuck. much fubar. Key sentence:

##GOD DAMN BILL GATES argument political cover covid death numbers. live state (Michigan) hit pretty hard early on, like March April. somehow thought rest country would learn experience prepared hospitals, testing kits, lockdown plans, etc.

But nope.  True. covering lunacy passes “debatable policy” $40 still lot many people. expecting *way* expensive. That's laws (and punishments breaking them) exist: people fucking retarded. 

A good leader helps people even goes people want. people general idiots. 

I saying decades, finally open everyone see. 150,000 graves look zoom in.Use Ctrl mouse wheel. Finally! Locals keep telling too. Ok yes found . subreddit. Poster knew family . Claimed covid . Also note FYI high percentage false negatives tests . Wonder many russian bounties trump now. protests world. Republican states opened early never took lockdown seriously getting overwhelmed right now? Eh, chose it. dunno tangent going on, mask mandate cases isn’t set law, illegal wear mask. Therefore, rely employees enforce, bad idea *because* people may inclined anger violent crime may overreact.

No one debating violent acts arent crime. Duh. course are. violent crime initiated event. case, seen across country cases, assault murder occurred mask mandate attempted enforced. person wasn’t criminal chose act criminal manner.

But can’t lock people *think* might one day commit crime. get locked *because* commit crime. enforcing mask mandate may expose minimum wage employee assault person inclined commit crime, crime crime doesn’t matter wouldn’t happened unless triggering event (being denied service) didn’t push unstable people it.

In words, employees job enforce mask mandate besides initial request signage. Governments making law. people think 140lb female cashier refusing check someone mask. No. That’s putting low-wage person zero training regard enforce something police officer security sort doing.

“Well don’t hire security guards?” might ask.

May fair point, still aren’t direct Lowe’s employees enforcing, point post. employees aren’t trained shouldn’t asked expected enforce. mean yes trump voters suck like he’s accelerated What, point gun? threat jail, prison, violence authorities?

Why always solution? Everyone convinced everyone else goddamn animal. treat people like animals, know become? Animals.

For permanent, lasting, meaningful change, need stop forcing people start enlightening people things right way. long-term mind.

Politicians care enough shit lie get elected. way. Lol right. Happy 🎂! Working virus , shit mark day. awful lot corn! trick simply functional public health care system place. German system example scale size. one public health agency area 50-100k people scale handle current crisis track trace. Lockdown decision state level ~10-15m like China fine. 

Then simply provide many test possible fast possible test everyone shows symptoms. Mandatory controlled quarantine anyone infected nearest contacts contacts symptoms. Testing anyone short contact without symptoms. 

Germany never lockdown whole country either. always slightly different one state really harmless compared european countries. Bavaria example rule allowed meet anyone outside indoors home family state 2 persons public 4 people private (family more).

The control question whether public institution country work maintained least bit last decades. people die cancer.  Competing risks. would come internet tell lies?


Aww edited lies out. DeSantis got tossed bus orange boss! Well, choice yours. Mediocre education dead kids people spread to. 1) Don’t let anyone love Americans think move whenever want. buy mass hysteria. Pretty sure people Sweden enjoying everyday lives never lockdown. Cases continue drop despite lockdown enjoying normal lives rest pandemic. That's know American. Yes feel like clarify agree well &amp; classify Democrat. trying make judgement call Holcomb leadership observation doesn’t seem batshit crazy GOP leadership across country 🤷🏼‍♂️  didnt say hospital I'm say REAL building. Reading comprehension man.. shit would assume so. certainly maintaining current protocols get early flu shot. problem is, half population get flu shot every year. Combine idea many people covid-19 ""just flu"" recipe disaster. read “young vibrant” looked pictures like.... woman died clearly overweight. article spreading awareness, would informative know pre existing health issues had. 

It’s terrible people dying, please don’t hide facts us. Trying scare everyone age group backfires people look photo go “but I’m fit healthy won’t happen me, probably [x weight based health issues].”

Uncertainty helps one. point, still realized health risks involved wearing mask, they're incapable rational thought. That's think, calm rational working endless shifts shitty pay 6 foot 3 man getting face, kudos you. I’m glad top comment first though. don’t much add except don’t know it’s hard people understand. It’s made up.

Edit: thought though. Well, getting vccinated much convenient.  implying legitimate ruler? always said exports real sports uh  bet there’s tons people walking around like “My GOD! place smells like shit too! Everywhere go smells like ASS!!”  I’m interested see death numbers future. many additional people died pneumonia, blood clots, heart attacks etc. see realistic figure many football fields Yeah 6 restaurants thousands locations isn’t really much pattern could sold Chinese made face masks MAGA got richer bumpkin army. Thats bad business man is. never crossed mind once. rotate kids day week whole class never together? idea Merkel scientist. Thanks RagingNerdaholic! 🙄 disappointed CA. obviously smaller labs gave negative results. figured out, working issue....Florida crap state crappier govenor. looks like incompetence problem shithole state.

Do think conspiracy couple small labs reporting 100% tests positive? think playing funny numbers, would throw negatives? 

Do think every state, city, county, country this? Every lab?

Sounds like shithole state needs get act together....By way, Florida hospital ICU beds full 40 Florida hospitals. think bunch fake patients, pretending cling life? Can’t social distance peaceful protests wear masks. Where’s explosion infections NYC Minneapolis? protests world idiot. lead big spikes mostly cuz outside. places spiking Republican leadership fuck prevent spread virus opened shit. Read weeks ago something like one ten Floridians positive.
Im Florida March. feel like Trump Republicans blew Democrats forefront warning talking it. seems like ever since obama elected, Republicans refuse work Democrats anything. pandemic comes up, Democrats say hey take seriously, Republicans like nah, dont need socialism common sense politics. Plus began long impeachment, know really bitter well.

I dont know. like Republicans hive mind. need boat, saying things. cant Republican support right choose. in. Like, talk them, like talking Tucker Carlson. say things. Democrats thing, they're little bit better individuality. Democrats try get everyone together, theres progressives ideology governance, they're still accepted listened party, even rest party always agree it. 

Then theres whole war science them. seems scientists doctors say things dont want hear. Burning fossil fuels bad environment, exon mobile buddy lobbyist says ok, I'll believe college degree got reading books! virus bad going kill people mess economy wear masks shut while. freedoms! cant get haircut! people stay home nobody shops feeds endless hunger capitalism! 

I dont get anymore. scary time live in. According reddit Sweden would devastated widespread death destruction. it? They're getting couple hundred cases average moment. people skeered Satan's jock strap 5G LTE antenna gonna throw tantrum

I mean, they've throwing tantrum. Society turned giant dysfunctional family crazy relative loses shit time everyone else feels need tiptoe around. Yeah, understand point here, prefer see sides make informed decision based available facts. religion political views. Perhaps that’s me. However president press conference claiming numbers going clearly creates issue lying. Someone is, White House multiple states lying? I’m sure think vaccine coming year too. Spoiler alert: 0% chance.

I'm impression vaccine ready anytime soon. sure got that? 

Did mean offend, apologies that. also acknowledge change tone helpful general population. He's walking fine line ensuring keeps job speaking realistically. even help much he's involved briefings such. Bricks mortar make hospital. electrical, gases HVAC. *My Mitch better money.* 
*Through rain, sleet snow.*

*Not half, some, cash.* 
*'Cause don't,* 
*I'm gonna put vote dead @#$.*

Thank you, Wayan Brothers.  headline kind misleading IMO. Apple's seeing outbreaks occurring looking numbers online presence, money, willingness shut sooner. closing data shows growth would act leading indicator. said would quit get stay home. unbelievable part everyone sent home April, pulled back late May. everything way fucking worse sent home. fact everyone's office right need fucking unreal. Herd immunity without effective widely used vaccine likely pipe dream. Wishful thinking isn’t going change that. happened 5 minute tests used coronavirus task force?  [No, literally posted misinformation virus actual attempt get Americans killed 

You’re terrorist We’re gonna feel super stupid disappears. So, completely unabashedly touchable. well, many states, many officers wont arrest fine don't, either due impossible enforce without potential violence agitation, due beliefs legality orders. also help earlier orders supported federal government/executive branch. protesting lockdowns masks read tweets president saying things like ""liberate Michigan,"" advising governors meet protestors agree requests/demands. help. many studies released recently pointing long term immunity. shouldn’t expected keep science, also realize you’re keeping science thus don’t anything base opinion on. obese

Borderline? 100% agree you. rebuttal would health experts paid big pharma push medicine/vaccines. expect coddled rich yuppie golf camp? wtf. ~reporting poolside gated community... name, omg. Got go spread church think desiring past evils current ones way. Opens door tolerating never tolerated.

Bush's wars killed people Covid-19 US. people Americans. 

Trump bad mean need grudgingly accept seems like tolerable evil. easy think way see fall Trump's decisions eyes, whereas past obvious affecting you(in general, specifically). Stop giving people eye tests solve blindness Correct. person responsible words. course three months I’ve seen headline opposite least four times each. 

Just assume get time infinite number times. Otherwise you’re fueling people’s burning desires go practice social distancing wear masks. Sorry, know McDonald's public boon. better nothing better outcomes opinion? fiancé hospital nurse NY, seen first hand. die something unrelated test positive COVID write covid, seen eyes. Dear America. 
When virus discovered leaders said, “it’s far away, won’t come US. best, squash them” yet nothing. 

When virus starts killing you. leaders said, “don’t worry. real big bad virus. It’s like flu. disappear own. Carry on, think money lose cautious” convince nothing. 

When virus starts spreading like wild fire. leaders said, “hah! best nation earth. virus may spreading strong. virus won’t affect us much. Don’t worry, stay home little won’t affect you. weak die, young children won’t affected. Stay positive!” convince continue nothing. 

When virus starts killing people thousands day. leaders said, “don’t worry, control. need wear masks cautious. don’t panic don’t anything, things go away own. pretty sure even though looks like affect young. won’t affect children. don’t worry send school. “ tried convince continue nothing.....

Tomorrow:.......... Reminds Goal written Goldratt workers Bakers Bay tested positive virus made least one isolated elite communities. must freaking. you’re gonna change law, fitting crimes. also hurts real hate crimes causes lump bucket:

* biological/chemical weapon assault

And prob number public health statutes. 🤣  idiot chief decided pander 40% knows 60% done him. hope gain saying this? know terrible thing. job state facts, yes, also leader matter.  Somehow doubt Mitch McConnell, one despised politicians US, going see read suddenly think ""gosh, they're mad. guess listen them"" instead personally contacting AG Barr request sending DHS thugs tear gas beat protestors. 

He cared anyone rich donors friends entire career, would start now. You’re absolutely unhinged. daughter learning disability going tiny private school (basically taking someone else's house home schooled) $600 month. know tiny money most, less paying day care wife quit job). European countries big compared US. Netherlands size Connecticut remember correctly stop that, lol made laugh hard wrong, broken clock right twice day. PR goof made asymptomatic carriers ""very rare"" certainly help keep numbers down. got weeks increases catch new cases. Even rate increase slows you’ve still got many hundreds thousands new critical patients daily stay 2-4 weeks more. Time field hospitals federal army response don’t think state planned scenario despite that’s happened recent weeks rising cases. Yeah, Alabama. still using N-95’s May. organization state level coordination. Shut one state, people travel adjacent states. needs uniform response problem stop borders.

Well supposedly number infected 10x actually documented cases, doesnt mean fatality rate 10x lower failure feds ANYTHING create chaos indistinguishable purposefully making virus bad be. summer Holiday break, REALLY want proper wave Japan Agreed. American too. That’s good idea flu season.

In depressing news, drove rural town last weekend socially distanced visit mother-in-law outside (i.e. masks on, sitting 12 feet apart). saw 20 people line ice cream shop, none either socially distanced wearing masks. also saw Trump flags everywhere. Facepalm. mess. often was/is Taiwan testing teachers schools children? reason hospitals claim deaths COVID deaths financial reasons US? might left silent underlying condition trigger later life. never know things cant agree more. trump loses november expect removed Sorry wrong. He's least obese bordering morbidly obese. Nothing funny vaccine terrible illness. Im thinking im from. quite strict policies layed since mid March think was. schools/ 2 people family allowed once, people always keep distance others atleast 2 meters/ everything closed supermarkets. much possible work done home. since beginning June things gone back normal major virus outbreaks thanks precautions plus take years recover from. funny USA citizens taking thing seriously people power show correct lead. minister took mask temonstration absurdity official press release, seen minister making fool front people. powermove great leader. 9/11 pearl harbor around 3k look actions taken following days. Kinda scary think hit historic attack death levels daily virus soon. company announced today layoffs coming. can't wait, buckling bank account tense months. worry, shareholders, we're paying dividend! Maybe send kids college want broke. College waste, everybody talk gone wishes have. Going college automatically make smart. might give edge getting better job, make better worker. salty hysterical redditors downvoting LMAO That’s American phenomenon, that’s human phenomenon. people cease register statistics human lives certain point. pity political leaders

No pity voted in, either. Anti-vaxxers problem, though. 

 That's need higher minimum wage. isn’t even first time happened. Dollar General employee shot demanding mask like 2 months ago. many answers debated millennia, whether one satisfactory eye beholder. What's satisfactory may you, vary based philosophical religious beliefs.

If we're strictly talking within Christian framework, short answer satisfactory God allows suffering greatest good individual come world suffering exists. Now, lot layers corollaries questions ahead behind answer, that's core it. think really helps consider within Christian worldview here: humanity's greatest joy (which far surpasses sadness pain) complete willful communion God, complete sovereignty life, death, afterlife. Death end us God, something overcome suffering death able choose greatest joy. Suffering death therefore one avenue must travel order find way God thereby otherwise inaccessible joy (why individuals require separate matter, one answer could suffering belies notion masters world thus self-reliant needing God, version pride susceptible others. Pride exists consequence free necessary individuals freely choose love God, necessitated God's nature love seen trinitarian vision God co-equally lover, beloved, connection them).

I feel second half question based popular misconception Christian prayer. meant petition wish list items want happen, method aligning God's coming peace God's will. model Christ's prayer Garden Gethsemane: let cup pass me, Yours.

TLDR; agree messed millions. Check occasionally get sick get idea baseline. 95-100 normal. 95 could indicate sick. (Especially get multiple readings 95. readings noisy random 94 feel fine cause concern.) 92 worrisome, consult doctor already. 90 doctors probably already oxygen. 


Also get number expecting, redo another finger sometimes positioned wrong gives something crazy. least they’re outside. Ive talked w/ people since making little proclamation, seems indeed bit deluded (you see... I'm commoner :-).

Someone told one Super Richie-Rich Gated Communities (mostly ex-pats) mask apparently almost never seen worn neither residents, staff. could understands ""elite"" thinking protected needing mingle much commoners... neither wear masks, staff need enter rest community wear masks, point... lil neighborhood become hot-spot.

But that, could see situation described happening one smaller islands well case til point (cases increasing general though). get 2 1 coupons mail. Yeah lets cut payroll taxes print trillions drives inflation tax. Bait switch people know informed information research time using data guide decisions.

Maybe chem world bit static science, discount clearly world virology. I'm microbiologist. every death rigorously recorded, inevitably missed cases incorrect attributions. However cut bigger picture heart matter, well 200k excess deaths year would happened without Covid. go something public like buy groceries, would quite suprising see someone 100+ lbs overweight. That's ubiquitous obesity become America. I’m surprised MS 7 hospitals. ""phds"" ""phucking huge dumbass"". Remind mutation 18 months. dont worry trump powerful strong plan like one ever seen before

gee wonder keep using word powerful strong

1. america fucked

2. lets get work fix it, home article “It may possible coronavirus strike person twice” Trump didnt call virus hoax try downplay it, instead shut tell people wear masks, wouldnt 140k+ deaths right now. Let people know wtf they're regards virus job. 

One problem that: [Trump fired CDC's pandemic response team There's like 325,000,000 people.. US 10 states less deaths Australia. :( I’m guessing know precisely 0 restaurant owners. also go PNW think depends major. sister school graphics design technology they've online month. I'm school education still three person classes. 

I wish could online. mean, education major, can't even field work schools area (understandably) want outside people classrooms. think they're worried that, worry putting 30 kids classroom together. takes one get sick suddenly whole school infected. 

I think see ALOT Indiana teachers retiring. Yeah sucks. need fucking uprising, government listening us, need make listen! fair portion comment tongue cheek, believe science 100 percent dedicated develop vaccine. actions government mean time seem suggest especially uk elderly almost targeted. one investigation (I dont recall source im looking 3am) said looked like government seeded old peoples home covid. Struggling take question joke. influenza virus eradicated, yet wear masks time it. People wear they're sick, spread virus people. miracle;  science hard work hospital staff. /shockedPikachu daughter summer school. Suppose depends school. son still work classmates keep form socializing kids age. educational games together 30 minutes talk other. guess depends teacher teacher still wanted kids age get socialization. yet. Hopefully rest IPS falls line them. attempts discredit BLM well noted. police union sending check.  mean ""Obamagate"" ??? That's terrifying. Deaths keep going up. haven’t DeSantis shut state and/or statewide mask mandate? know things bad President Trump tell state mess. ""incredible amount""

""twice"" meetings last longer 2 hours topics far less complex.

That seems like would weeks long, 2 months long transition topic. Yup. necessarily fear, often caution. live life fear drunk drivers, there's one road, I'm gonna give LOT distance, even means take little longer get home.  Clinton Obama hands letting lot big ticket donors get control. Ever heard Holder DOJ? decided investigating wall street crime loser 2008.  It’s really profound courageous make statement. flu common cold aren’t totally eradicated. planning sending virus electric chair? Aside fact Japanese people good hygiene general, also think fact people usually live crowded homes. Like singles usually apartment instead room-sharing, even Tokyo. multi-generational families living one roof quite rare. husband's grandparents nineties still live home. even someone gets infected, bring home spread 5+ people time unlike big families (virtually impossible social distance home). country, vector spread usually home--we culture big families staying single house, even widespread mask usage strict lockdowns, virus spreading fast. name dollars

which even delivered. ya people think 18% misinformation since include duplicates negative positive rate add new positive rates satisfy negative duplicates testing positive rate. really worth possible death, causing death loved one, go out? Yes, get claustrophobic &amp; depressing stay locked indoors long period time, surely beats dying. understand hard people digest severity situation. Like said comment, U.S. 4% population, last heard, 30% Covid-19 cases. Mexico, Canada, U.K &amp; many able flatten curve U.S. looking like ramp rollercoaster. government told bold faced lies severity &amp; wasted time lockdown time prepare &amp; get control, like countries managed do. So, really big deal wear mask - &amp; properly? ....As leaving nose hanging out. saw someone compare wearing underwear, leaving dick hang out. What's point? Ahhh stand corrected. Thank you. tobacco products added aromas banned since 2016...with exception menthol. *Internet hug*. National Socialist party elitist. Scientists doctors overrepresented early Nazi movement party. Nazis scientists proportionally German party time.  

So maybe absolutely nothing that. Nazis controlled universities controlled country.  mean, I’m assuming large portion people retired job security lack economic stressors probably helped tremendously. think typical every country around world. untold numbers ppl sent home hospitals full handle ""mild"" cases, something statisticians study long while.  one flying now. things happen. Right mil plane India visa up. older overweight I'm concerned despite taking every possible precaution. cannot always prevent. Winnipeg fireworks / gatherings cancelled Canada day. dunno. Wow. surprising. could ever seen happen.

Hopefully effected selfish assholes suffer minor inconvenience fellow citizens. said need right now, back March believe,, mentioned may make worse people fiddling around touching face lot public (looking you, Mom.) lot people, ""not recommended"" saying utterly useless never it. Unfortunately I've seen lot people use Fauci clip ""prove"" masks zero ability help. right laugh market west. East Asian cultures wore masks general preferred medical grade ones medical suppliers. business would failed likely. Whoa combat like triage decisions made USA? remember hearing Italy going heart hurt them. countrymen hold alot resent towards elected leaders. know White House said magically delicious. Remember generally sick people getting tested 18% sick people tested positive. got looong way go gets everyone. telling unsick people get tested aswell though? Actually studies say masks protect wearers well. Needs conclusive peer review would, initially, imply even benefits mandate masking country.

[post case you’re Fauci one many reasons United States failed miserably COVID-19. However clashes president, also failed miserably COVID-19, viewed sort hero many people sub.

The politicization COVID-19 probably main reason United States virus. inability see past red blue beyond sad. Zero chance Donald 300.  kind job have? going 3-5 years, vaccine projected start rolling fall. Meaning herd immunity thing pre winter minus people choose get it, they're opting really cares. 1/50 governors called nationwide mandate Cant believe people getting mad employees, already risking lives going work everyday, enforcing mask policy risk getting shot anti mask nutcase. needs enforced law enforcement we're gonna serious it... Mitt Romney earned lot good will.
As Left-leaning person, miss days Right folks still something respect, even agree.
These days. . . Delhi extremely young demographics. 6 percent 60 older. NYC, contrast, 16% 60 older.m

It would expected freakishly low death rate things powerful large amount morons thinking they're right.  I’d bet people work them, supply them, count pay mortgages rent, count tax revenue generate don’t see “commodity.”

Buddy, point cure worse disease. Really, find way. disease far deadliest survived century century. comments twitter post DeWine making statement something fun read through. Americans idiots. 

I even read reply implied

What? want type sloths DMV handling critical health issues? Sounds like awful plan. most, government handle paperwork around funding parks such. asking handle biological pandemic outside function city planning.

These politicians idiots best.

The rely them, worse things get. Systemic problems come systemically broken population. Politicians little power compared mass number cooperating people do. point drown government bathtub.  ""One try spin Tegnell staying Sweden better Norway, certainly needs spin get there. ""

You stating Tegnell said Sweden better Norway. Tegnell never said that. seem understand Swedish. saying large scale outbreaks Sweden theoretically benefit higher immunity levels population easier ride. bold statement write articles it. like, since they've gone past appropriate number deaths ""tragedy"" they're trying get number ""statistic"". point glorious incomprehensibility numb people enough seem bad. they're willing let people die economy, letting die shift optics far off. OK, thanks information. Unless live Alberta...

Still running country thank god, they're charge here, know mean. let's get back living

They always shouted this. way shutting debate.

Like... wtf supposed say? can't negotiate virus.  lol classic subhuman maga trash Sure, Norway Finland (both ~5.5mm pop.) either low even lower infection burdens. Norway = 2.0 Finland = density matters LOT Brooklyn lot vulnerable Nordic nation. problem United States grew idea individualism. you. Unfortunately, can't really fight pandemic type mentality however culture built around collectivism work together probably handle fine. However, idea collectivism coming together really within culture painted socialism and/or communism past hundred years so. unfortunately paying price now. exactly Germany did, they're quite well relative population density. They're ~~1/3rd~~ 1/4th population US, area slightly smaller Montana. Shit, entire country way fewer total infections leading four US states (NY, FL, TX, CA) alone. 

Amazing happen leader *literally scientist.*

Edit: mathed wrong nuns nice people  Look, things leveling out. enough body bags weeks numbers. There’s really issue here.

But could really solid wear mask would terrific buddy getting bit upset that’s fave. ""Worst nightmare far..."" Also, kids need care days aren’t school parents continue make money, means exposing early childhood education professionals younger children.  ah yes good thing opened bars eschewed masks. would thought would happen? shocking Which, unless totally butchered source material, allegory. movie created socialist pretty ham fisted socialist message. ridiculous. school district meeting via zoom 'townhall' answer parents questions return school plan. we're cool sending kids back, zoom meeting?  Good you? Every pregnancy different, eating every 3 hrs. less would get light headed terrible headaches. funny? I’ll admit one people, I’ll try give reasonable response, please hear out.

Texas, Florida, Cali, states didn’t really first wave back spring simply first waves now. Whether deaths would happened spring didn’t lock all, winter stayed locked fall, locked little bit irrelevant - point is, deaths sealed fate happen day virus escaped containment levels US. 

It naive think prevent deaths microscopic pathogen incredibly latent symptoms. literally way could stopped thing time March now. 

The good news data places like Sweden didn’t lock yet excess deaths fall basically normal levels own, fraction population even infected. deaths ticking areas, know even absolute worst case whwre nobody anything prevent them, they’ll fall well entire population infected.

I think biggest mistake say deaths wouldn’t happened later. Masks social distancing - help reduce person person transmission - societal level don’t *prevent* spread, rather slow it. it’s unfair look deaths attribute malice neglect. covid deaths simply covid deaths would happened later virus inevitably spread extent, albeit bit slowly states implemented stronger measures.

I’m tired, tired fighting. anybody response, please try keep civil? Things going well, apparently. opened wrong, wrong time, seems. also seems places New York Boston, surge, attributing good fortune policy skill inchoate sociocultural superiority.

That said, fortunate places almost temperate zones, populations vacation, largely outside, windows open, feature chastened population, learned contagion first-hand experience. There's real geographical unity southern surge notable. across entire southern latitude country, merely ""American South,"" fact towers commonalities policy, leadership, social cultural tendencies might explain crescendo. 

To me, what's scary happens season changes. indeed seasonal, northeast considerable risk come fall, population, much unexposed immune, heads indoors summer fun--at time celebrating apparent victory virus. Imagine paying insurance bill every month years get turned away need it. Except white people willing shitty hard jobs illegals do. They'd get there, whine manual labor day move back. [Bill's Evil Plan perfectly American deny deny deny happens play pride lol. ducking nuts man. Right, get fast possible vulnerable parts population risk long time. get it. Caifornia never fully reopened. mask social distancing mandates earlier almost state. closed businesses stayed shit longer anyone else. 

If worked, would become hotspot? Even then, they'd things protect still hang rest us dry. parents like while, taking seriously all, bunch people church died and/or hospitalized. church mostly elderly folk, like half everyone real bad condition. wife’s side family bunch deaths relatives still think it’s hoax :/ fuck benefits lying death rates high

Democrats wanting get rid Trump. could actually undoing. Russia thing, dozen sexual assault allegations, financial crimes, divorces affairs. huge countries recovering America failing, HARD much want take heat, does.

Even Republican voters can't deny makes look bad. think Biden keep mouth closed let stupid shit fall (My recommendation), could win. shit. believe we'll even deadlier ""second wave"" fall continue wear masks, WFH can, socially distance, etc. I’m infringing rights taking mine things want need, like elective procedures socializing, quite easily pursue lifestyle prevents ever coming meaningful contact coronavirus carriers. won’t get covid grocery delivery, value getting disease, take steps continue need want. Kids gross. don’t know better, are. Cowards That's point though. 

Name another city Europe cruise traffic eliminated. Abbot got lazy, listened much deniers. decided stuff happens New Yorkers, aka ""real Americans""

He actually banned cities issuing mask mandates. Still masks. Damn it! reason covid deaths keep going doctors nurses keep checking pulse patients. insane, US among highest death toll b/c checked pulse many americans. Exactumundo.

If would played cards right (as said, unite rather divide) let experts handle heavy lifting, would landslide territory reelection.

Now, much. Oh Florida... never past phase one. Shoot. even first boss. predict Karen's Chad's wanting wear mask approximately 300,000 die march 2021. bubonic plague many monasteries completely wiped out. Also fact monks trying spread GOD’s message dying plague, monk travelers brought disease back monastery. Yes. hire back 30% less previous wage, eliminate step raises. break contract illegal lockout short curlies. Ontario place. good news. report story number tests though. almost two 747 crashing everyday understand saying, agree need together this, see use blaming singular governmental member cause issues. Even think even disingenuous look education funding claim that's source behavior. believe discussed length lately (systemic racism leads lack funding underprivileged minority communities) minority cities filled anti-maskers people believe hoax? anything, would argue people proliferating b.s. plenty educated see trump way changing lives. course would EASIER trump aligned scientific community excuse fact educated people knowingly diminishing scientific findings.

Also, uncovered portion motive well hidden course, believe national government country size needs limited power state governments needs strengthened far large singular leader handing rulings unilaterally, input ""representatives"" hardly actually represent constituents wants/needs. health experts... worst nightmare anybody basic understanding viral spread exponential growth. doesn’t work you’d never breathe soda straw work physically exhaustive job site without asthma control. issue wearing mask I’m walking store short times there, wear one makes feel I’m going pass faint job site people closer 10-15 feet me. Common sense goes long ways. Simple solution blind everyone! Trump's speech yesterday virus cringe worthy even funny. saying ""democratic states getting hit hardest virus"" ""kids spread virus fast kid adult vs. adult adult"", saying ""we seeing positive trend virus, less people infected April"" - insane? One word: Florida Private insurance companies last 20 years: “hold beer”

They called “quality life decisions”  geez..better late never guess. shitshow. think wear mask invincible uninfectable? That’s ridiculous. Look amount cases California protests. time fits exactly protests. infected 20-30 y.o age range. protests big big factor. It’s almost like DeWine Holcomb speaking regularly. facts? NYC lately? It’s become absolute hell hole. Rioters destroying anything get hands on, homeless everywhere, empty store fronts. dems terrific job. makes sad, I’ve Texas many times work. Don’t let stereotypes fool you, really good folks there. Honest, kind warm, invite homes barely knowing you. preventable, many examples, wuhan, Italy fucking New York. didn’t need happen. heart breaks mind shudders think someone die covid outside hospital. Fighting every breath, subcostal breathing, muscles tire out, can’t anymore. one go like that. hell deniers, unmaskers, anti-vaxers. Damn gonna reply, answer think they're alright. Deaths/Cases=MortalityRate. CDC estimates actual mortality rate 0.65%. lot cases go uncounted, though, asymptomatic low symptomatic people getting tested. Generally closer states Mortality Rate actual mortality rate, better job state identifying infected individuals. lower Deaths/Capita, better state controlling virus.

North Dakota Mortality Rate around 1.8%. 50 states range 0.7% 9.1%. North Dakota deaths/capita 126/million US range 18 1777/million. North Dakota's reporting identification better majority US.

The northeast states ones deserving scrutiny also depends much leeway given first hit. Washington California, also hit early on, seem fared much better, though. Multiple reasons, biggest hospitals overwhelmed yet. happens death rate jumps up. simple really. can’t treat people need treatment going deaths. would kill talk rampart days. Expected sarcasm, sarcasm never showed up.

Instead, got failed attempt troll. Sad. First Brexit terrible covid handling. Brits feel exceptional, opinion Europeans self-righteous Boris terrible job. empire anymore, mates 🙂 Given conclusions illogical clearly ridiculous, would waste time go exercise proving ""study"" wrong. Whatever reasons, appear motivated something science logic. 

That motivation cited attack validity conclusions - conclusions farcical absurd face. motivation cited explanation would present absurd conclusions. don’t eat take out. people making food back could infected breathing food. Fuck Used sides could compromise till mediocre deal could tolerate hate time Working low level public facing jobs called privilege, result making bad decisions. Minorities get cry privilege, also minorities better ""privileged"" whites (eg. Asians). South Korea contained months. Italy disastrous outbreak since contained it, there's less per capita spread best performing American states. stay vigilant, contact tracing indoor mask use effectively contain long need little disruption daily life. School returning likely next big challenge.

It's impossible contain, spreading idea somehow inevitable coping mechanism.  Lol same. started filling pantry shopping trips wife's eyes bulging receipts... singing different tune people find Tp stuff month two later! BTW, thanks this, appreciated. Florida dead canary coal mine bad going go nationwide. that, companies want people work home even people testing positive office. 

If asymptomatic essential, long wear mask, work. 

Some animal hospitals area positive workers still working. 

These horrible think happening is. sure isn’t leaning Deepfake shit? defend property &amp; life situation arise. chances needing &amp; also causing escalation situation low. Yet, insist. There's group actively sabotaging education though. literally campaigned removing critical thinking skills lessons words plot undermine parental authority. imagine protestors think go.in surgery, surgeon typically little know oxygen brain cuts open prods organs fro, whikst verge brain death anywhere let girlfriend probably quarantine 14 days separately able see other.  

I'm sorry.

But researched this, might somewhere.  encourage going though.  year pandemic. unless moving permanently.

I know painful apart. Pandemics cruel.  think you’re almost there.

My thoughts this:

Trump deathly afraid disloyal people staff. constantly deal leaks info point doesn’t trust anyone White House, imagine even reservations ivanka Jared well.

I think advised properly he’s mistrustful people advising opposite told do, he’s deep dig bouncer would sign walled booth bear spray available  Harris county judge hildago mayor turner asked shut down, abbot won’t let them. abbots fault haven’t heard shit this. go PNW well. check schedule like week classes constantly changing. school, school education, moved half classes online half still person. person classes 8 weeks rather 16. 

It's hot mess future uncertain, especially great seeing school starts less month. Wow feel sorry her. must living hell every day. 0.0001% Florida's children died. theory mitigation make number go factor around 10-100. sorry loss.  Yes, worth noting driving car actually become significantly safer years. Roadway design, seatbelts, car safety features, drunk driving awareness, etc. severely reduced risk dying car accident.

So accept risk, industry government actually cooperated reduce risk. Much like cars driving, impossible completely ban kind activities expose us COVID risk, mean worth trying mitigate risks much possible. worse fans all. Cleanse boomers Thank amazing government definite moment invitation sent April. sent present called good. can't wait schools reopen around world, children get negative effects virus, negative effects like life fact helped contribute death family members rest life. /s hell... insert virtual players virtual game look time money wasted real thing. /S  coulda watching virtual baseball months, people depressed virtual players free. 😁 also amounts perhaps 20/week pay increase rather lump sum No... say 'Morbidly... 


 here's response. Hoepfully they'll update it. hear bleach Windex quite effective right here, truth. True... true-ish, anyway. competitive house races year (I live TX-23 one truly competitive US House districts country, honestly) even slim realistic chance Dems win majority Texas state house reps, would huge. I'd put chances success well 5%, that's still orders magnitude larger decades. 

What going take simple: voter turnout. simple easy two very, different things.  restores faith humanity; usually IHOP already given yourself, good see people following rules even ""Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity"" add read tobacco gian reemtsma getting areound producing menthol aroma cards tobacco pavks hour achieve sort menthol flavour. Bizzarre 5,345 deaths Florida. Three kids.

That’s *insanely* specific. It’s though aren’t kids state.

If children trying kill old people disease would designed.

Edit: I’m saying deaths kids don’t matter. I’m saying asymptomatic kids dangerous. Whether kids dying (they mostly aren’t) still need keep home school. Fauci said mistake ban China. Reddit phds using satire accounts. Bush comes Chenney, Chenney competent evil Trump can't be. people like Chenney Barr know actually get away - must absolutely ever come power soon someone wants make exception get together, tells last person want get together this. **Florida reported 10,200 new cases Thursday, bringing state's total nearly 390,000** 

 **The state reported 173 new virus-related resident deaths, new daily record, bringing death toll residents 5,500** 

 **Miami-Dade Broward combined accounted almost 40% Thursday's new cases** lower R0, lower requirement herd Immunity, good. raise minimum wage, parent stay home kids, least 2-parent households. need state obvious? Came say  Instead let narcissism wipe reelection prospects

Unfortunately polling show that's absolutely guaranteed, people need actually vote make mistake last time presuming he's going win. agree adjust schedules allow breaks between. guys would open wearing I’d think. well, whenever feeling sick sure viral stage i.e first couple days cold. ""It ain't much heat, much humdiddity"" Protests vast majority people wore masks? NYC, one cities protests, seen spike cases?

Why hometown, one right lake, specifically seeing spike cases 2-3 weeks 4th July? town 20% county population 60% coronavirus cases. flu kills kids COVID-19. beds exist there's staff run them. Someone used example 50 ""available"" fire trucks 10 firemen drive them. 
They're physical beds, they're doctors nurses. electric chair here. use random untested injected chemicals.

Which makes sense since Trump endorsed Rona treatment back. That's Indiana you! Constantly living past. least cost living low, mind living near cornfields think rather drugs people could opting natural solutions - like Hinokitiol...I seen research good antiviral.. products. Right?!? try tell us it’s protestors...the logic escapes Yep. Awful traumatizing.  That’s factually incorrect, never research indicating masks weren’t effective obviously effective deployed Asia decades great benefit. literally test masks rate effectiveness they’re mass produced sold. N95 isn’t branding term, pass test block 95%+ particles larger 3nm. Also several kids Florida passed . sure preexisiting article vague one wasn’t . conspiracy? They've stopped recording number suicides, drug overdoses, cancer deaths ect. since Rona started. I've looked numbers able find them, I've found numbers global deaths, cancer makes nearly 50k wanted find US one banned China, trump admin banned Chinese nationals coming US. Anyone else China free come spread COVID, did! Sorry, Cuomo getting endless puffing cable news glued make less incompetent. second wave begin October follows timeline past pandemics Thats anti mask people saying - know people studies. Welcome club - vary exclusive im afraid. Definitely. 

I realize ""a [new health condition associated COVID-19,"" even know long-term effects MIS-C could kids. forgot unemployed ones passing bills. US sports like MLB playing without audiences WANT SNOWFLAKES DID?!!?!?!?!??????!?!?!?!!! dare shit horses like that! yeah hospitalization decline week long point... holds could see deaths peak another week two... Fauci referring USA? world?  Common sense would tell partial presence masks make protesting vicinity thousands people, shoulder shoulder chanting/shouting/yelling, safer eating restaurant 20 people properly social distanced.

How many thousands protesters touch face mask washed hands? many even properly fitting mask bandana? many stayed 6 feet apart? many removed masks eat drink talk? many went home families, roommates, went work amongst people without self-quarantining? somebody sneezed mask on, 10 people within 3 foot vicinity, really think chance droplets spreading, least leaking onto face subsequently hands places?

Common sense common, trust hypocrites tell educated assumption entails scenario. experts contradicted almost every aspect virus, either side tells confidently supported science common sense excuse full shit.  would make exactly amount money distance learning. Let’s thank lucky stars isn’t smallpox Time turn Florida island. surprised happened. Young surgeon, nervous operation, tries take edge winds making mistake reactions compromised.

Nothing wrong marijuana recreationally state legal (I rarely advocate breaking law, plenty places legal). position people relying dexterity reaction times probably using *on shift*. disaster economy. 13%+ unemployment. look up. assume referring this:  agree messaging consistent changes data information, especially regards novel virus. 

I take issue messaging masks regardless intent. US never embraced masks EGREGIOUS error Trump, Fauci, Jerome Adams go masks beginning. understand health care workers needed N95s, however people wearing N95s rather homemade masks point. messaging bad, regardless intent. ok different opinions this. think agree horribly mismanaged many different levels.  hands pulse oximeter. 

100% agree. got one 2months ago. kid California died . I’ll find .
Edit add : friend family posted article reddit.. search would end lockdowns. problem them: definable end. fact still needs get brought absurd. countries simply mandate they're done. US, becomes state decision state agrees even state decides it, enforced manner (this changing slightly now). simple fact: even wearing mask helped little, that's infinitely better nothing going grain intentionally wearing one should. method people need practicing, damn, simple stuff no-brainer.  I’m suggesting isn’t disaster, Start County Memorial Hospital 48 staffed beds short term care facility. Brazilian. governors set laws saying local leaders can't strict rules. sue local leaders stricter rules. That's great except 9 year old girl died Florida yesterday Fuck automod. People blinded propaganda. would representatives North Korea helping North Korean government coverup? What's motivation? 

A lot people need conspiracy theory North Korea much offer.  thought r/coronavirus allow op eds? list states ranked death rate never happier see state bottom table. Go DE! Turns can’t economy without controlling virus! Low? actually heard theory viruses tend weaken time. believe want evolve evade immune system host, kill them. great statement. Why? right. always right. always right.

As opposed another statement eventually right. hopes.

Fauci one hand, shit other. See smells like Trump first. I've never seen Arby's employee once. I've always assumed employees meat. Boy want power....I hope niver git point. CA learned lessons. Civil disobedience ok. victor G-Dubya....I’ll take him. Leave others behind 🤣 friends work universities California they're laughing administrators' wishful thinking like somehow forgot college giant social venue people party, study, drink, game, date, sex. literally stopping spread students campus. Let alone fact people living roommates probably working part-time jobs. Sounds low. Fence sitting voters, quite lot, will. whole thing. Pfizer regularly pisses away many billions settled lawsuits every year. Yes, great PR anyone, still wish they'll good job since involves injecting people something that's tested span time.. like every unquestioned vaccine released. still trust Pfizer making bucket. Man, love press releases one Buzzy Hummingbird? doctor probably see copious amounts sugar. Another good one. many times fold sheet paper thickness reaches sun? 

50 It’s Trump. entire Republican Party politicized pandemic. 

Trump acted like attempt address pandemic personal insult, republicans pretended “one side debate” instead deranged ravings lunatic. 

So are! really wish sort device could strap people would simulate breathing ventilator like them. I, least would want believe even five minutes would start shifting perspectives Remember people, pumped numbers they’re probably even actually dying Covid. wanna scare us guys! /s Karens driving surge. millennials.  well, sizable plurality morons wearing them! FYI, word looking ""hemisphere"" (hemi = half, sphere = globe, case) sucks could Squid Monster moment; common enemy unites people. Doesn’t matter vote for, everyone anti-COVID. 

How things get bad global pandemic politicized? Understated sentiment right here.  Oh, family friend TX medical care (respiratory therapist.)The patients hospital aren’t peaceful deaths either. 

Dying alone, covered bugs, piled unrefrigerated rooms days. oxygen, people would chance areas better healthcare lower rates COVID.

No family guests allowed hospitals, one advocate family/loved ones. It’s dismal. Sooooo apparently felt need comment without reading many articles posted saying protests much contributing factor, all, spread virus?

Outdoors + masks + moving = little risk. 

By means - ignore data science continue pontificate though. could've gift Trump's reelection. 

You know that's going happen now, right? He's putting mask, lots others too. curve flatten. He'll say leadership putting mask helped address pandemic.

Which true, many folks forget months late. Fuzzy math - GWB. mild fever overnight Tents Texas middle summer? interesting. Thanks posting. fair inclusive? definition inclusive right now. take amount immigrants give plenty shit get started here. even get started give ILLEGAL people better benefits average US Citizen often gets. part needs changed. though white countries want make ""diverse inclusive""? see lefties bitching Africa black, Asian countries Asian.

If country free, right free speech, firearms, sure hell protesting. would really like idiots think socialism good thing live socialist country week. There's many people came US grateful happy escape countries start new life free. course, legally. One shows want actually become American, two fair people waiting list get citizenship. could prevent many deaths never opening schools again. mean it? No. looks like numbers states suppressed (Florida Texas 10k, hmm) Lmao way put experts quotes telling. No, like people actually know talking seems people tend think US needs improve testing actually know extent what's going actual lockdown long enough handle current number cases, get actually contact tracing, mandate mask, etc. Simply stuff countries done get handle virus. whole ""we can't stay lockdown forever"" shouted since March reality done countries now. called Hobo Living, live life jumping one freight train another across America see r/FloridaCoronavirus people argue long time.

These comments don’t numbers. 50k new tests seems like good metric realize that’s cumulative total since *March*. It’s bad metric I’ll keep pointing reporting misinformation. There’s way determine new suspected infections, really OP trying get at. state *does* provide metric persons per day. makes state look lot worse, don’t use it. also definitely includes people re-testing see they’ve cleared infection. Still, gives better idea what’s happening day-to-day basis.  told 13,809 positive tests 102,190 persons tested yesterday, 9,752 new positive cases, would give idea what’s happening state. That’s reality situation. That’s exactly Florida reported yesterday. state spins look better removing repeat positives, OP spins remove repeat negatives. It’s bigger discrepancy OP way reasons repeated negatives, one reason repeated positive. Since state doesn’t even count newly suspected infections vs tests, there’s absolutely way get number OP wants get. It’s difference qualitative quantitative data. There’s metric determine someone received test. Full stop.

Here's another think least stats bc leaves someone comes along says 50,000 tests that's enough reality 100,000 he's counting half them

And big one 4 days positivity rate calculation **wrong**.  ""persons tested"" number reports **number unique individuals tested**, *regardless many many times tested*. tested negatively multiple times, counted once. tested positively multiple times, counted once.  number **new positive cases** dividing number **new persons tested** positivity rate.  give hypothetical example, imagine two people sample, test negative - positivity rate 0%. test again, one tests positive. ""Persons tested"" remains 2 (with difference 0), new positive cases 1. using calculation, undefined positivity rate using method calculation (divide zero), difference ""persons tested"".  **should** dividing number **new cases** sum **negative tests** (which reported report) + **new cases**, case gives positivity rate \~11.3%.  calculation excludes people previously tested negative, wrong, people potential test positive future, counted.

Which I'm duplicates negatives separate positive % now. live rural area California take job circle k schools shut down. basically place town actually enforces mask policy. deal shit time. I've cursed at, life threatened, called communist fascist span ten minutes manner soda thrown store. experience biggest burliest manliest men far biggest babies mask stuff. day boss getting shit guy freedom constitutional rights stuff young woman line behind said hoped enjoyed freedom make kids old people get sick die. shut real quick, huffed seconds left. need people witness bullshit going step shame people. Stand poor minimum wage making dude getting shit good reason It’ll make popular things tho. invested heard emperor clothes? dare bring context data this! /s


1% vs 20%? That's pretty damn significant.

The real gems always deep comments. one correct people Traitor Trump morbidly obese medical standards, borderline. Trump panicked worried stock market anything else. went experts everything suggested would result slower recovery stock market. stock market going golden goose ride fall baby boomers retiring loving 401k's skyrocketed first term. Pro-life controlling decisions women make, pretty much always been. rest marketing spin. definitely will, people get tested either, hope go home. Also understand college towns already filling students school online Right, 15 people next day, gone! /s It’s national emergency. fact it’s difficult inconvenient irrelevant. You’d never hear people complaining can’t food rationing air raid sheltering forever WWII. needs done get emergency least citizens dead. sit 400 sq ft studio apt three months sit Karen grade McMansion family. get people financially can’t forever that’s government putting money keeping people afloat like rest Western world. course won’t would socialism. that’s it: isn’t impossible situation. want cake eat instead we’re going get neither arrogance stupidity. One thing think comparing numbers 2017 average deaths. average deaths heart diseases, cancer stroke go year people likely die covid? 

I would bet aren’t hitting normal average deaths per day PLUS add 1205 covid deaths day. anyone know databases report multi-system inflammatory syndrome cases? hard find information many actually occuring since seem get info local news sources one lancet study France.  They've awfully quiet last week. know one guy personally (once again) changed attack. he's hangin old ""people die car accidents labelled covid deaths!"" They're really desperate even Trump telling wear masks. wrong, can't see getting it, I'm still worried. Though saw someone else mention basis vaccine another coronavirus, long term data formulation. puts ease, some. put rest asinine idea kids can't less prone get virus? But, but, would mean Donald wrong:-) Instead let narcissism wipe reelection prospects sacrifice 140k+ lives along way

I know things look like right now..

but one took seriously 2016 look happened. always ""well, tank prospects.."" yet, president.

Under circumstance anyone wants Trump office become complacent. Vote.

***VOTE!*** Oh it’s conspiracy cancer deaths? Man it’s hard keep up. Oh agree that. know someone who’s dad died Ford Pinto. straight crime. dad’s brother died night wedding supposedly (drunk 16 year old). 4.5 year brother died crossing street.

Cars dangerous people talk cell phones roll stops without looking. I’m suggesting ban cars, could reduce deaths better mass transit (probably right given covid, could done it). accept deaths instead something it.

It’s consumers demanded safer cars. fewer cars maybe growth cars. worry eventually magically go away Absolute missed opportunity. Hmmm, yes new studies showing activation parts immune system. 

Still don’t know work real world! 

When studies show way accurately measure immunity SARS2, perhaps I’ll believe them. then, I’m still told test Earth accurately show I’ve COVID19, let alone immunity COVID19

So accept population level life long immunity Coronavirus possible I’ll wait non-test tube based evidence. Wouldn’t worse nightmare like virus 100% mortality rate? really saying don’t interact store clerk anyone... doesn’t family risk... can’t.

This isolate 2 weeks anything that's going grocery store getting takeout... get people sick case caught makes silly kid

Perhaps. even kid. There's people ages incredibly stupid right now. There's people think masks work. There's even people still think disease hoax. everything life me, without strong leadership, it'll hard get thing control. 

Like home country nearly getting back normal. pretty strict 3 month lockdown. Recently ""spiked"" single digit new cases double digit new cases, they're beginning tighten things again. population 30+ million, population Canada. I'm sure there's many countries like follow situations closely can't comment that. Meanwhile US, perpetual dumpster fire yet lockdowns.  long stock market well Trump think economy great  got 3 million 4 million 16 days. rate, looking 70% penetration year. that's considering exponential growth. Harris County Texas population 43% Hispanic covid patients 63% Hispanic. combination language barriers disproportionately living multi-generational households.  got negative test result back 15 days. father killed President Kennedy? wife aided abetted heinous crimes?

It's really hard keep track. 18% people positive getting tested funsies. royally fucked sir memsantis born Karen gene Americans really bad diet. lot European countries eat fresh whole foods. American people outside big population centers right thing November? peak deaths came time yes, death numbers plateau months, much longer case counts hard NY shutdown, indicators look like they’ll high case count baseline herd immunity kicks 1. vaccine yet given public. Still atleast months away 

2. makes think majority dumbass Americans even take vaccine? live progressive state still hear whole lot people vowing take vaccine ""it came fast"" Repeated doses firmware updates microchip, we're billy boy /s Dunno. good question physician
 phobia flying. go physician get prescribed drugs fly. shame.. 5676 people died swedish government thought economically risky rest europe lockdown

these preventable Correct available either. Nurse here. lot patients experience ""happy hypoxia"" oxygen drops 70%'s felt fine, fatal quite quickly. Oxygen level least 92% unless patient chronic smoker. drops 90% come back deep breathing, seek medical aid immediately. diagnosed, get oximeter, cannot get one, ask around friends Facebook groups etc till find someone lend one duration self isolation. self isolation yourself, arrange buddy check text/call regularly increase frequency feel unwell. *finger nose* ""I'm reopening!"" Allow rephrase that:

How someone stupid, get position?

The answer: Mimic whatever President yells dods like mindless sheep. Yea, they're still young great chance turn around. much still some. ought have, nationwide, bare minimum survive, caution. study fact caution.

Are favor Indy500 full attendance study afterward shows fine? gambling lives. mistake.  see point, sir. suggest new strategy, R2. Let Wookie win. conspiracy apparently NY hospitals got funding covid deaths reported Let's travel Labor Day! :/ It’s climate science. can’t counter level ignorance make decades education failures. spent years arguing idiots online. They’ll never change opinions. 

But remember arguing rationally may sway thousands people read comments. it’s busy forum popular subreddit. potentially still worth it. doesn’t need it. Also many fat people US Europe Asia. Germany gives us run money allow virus spiral control. pissed inconvenience? one can't work kids staying home? Confusing stuff? That’s honestly disrespectful. Yeah, looks like they’re postponing non essential surgeries changing practices dedicate beds covid. They’re like f gon die sorry.

Texans refuse wear mask anything it. Get sick accept ok guess I’ll die now. Save yourself, go find doctor wtf. Keep saying enough times may become true.
Truth nobody knows. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Source? find hard believe given successful track trace been. Quantum Chemistry, less. thing he's trying reframe quote ""the virus disappear"". Initially saying virus even make mark US would disappear, he's trying make seem like eventually disappear point.

It's extremely sneaky. need hold accountable Americans lost lives lost jobs willful intentional actions resulted deaths. eat like! looks like typical old man photo. hat hiding godawful comb-over helps.  I've lockdown since early March lmao hair long belly big. meant Tom Brady ended Guantanamo Bay instead Tampa Bay, well, would something, it? observed household attack rate isn’t high implying.

Remember COVID spread heavily unbalanced. averages 3-5 per person naive environment. people transmit zero 1 people. small percentage transmit dozens. Superspreaders drive average  Influenza human-specific disease, though. somewhat regularly jumps humans animals (see: avian flu, swine flu). Maybe could argue could also vaccinate domesticated animals, virus wild populations come back eventually. 

Not mention, seasonal influenza vaccines target specific strains, would presumably much significant undertaking vaccinate known influenza strains. WNY opening indoor areas. sisters live outside Buffalo. testing ground loosening restrictions. Indoor dining open retail stores tourist stuff. entire world's approach wrong? Thousands scientists hundreds countries leaders, wrong? right? believe?

You've lost nobody family yet, take it. thing rest world America fear military. always find responses weird.

""OMG MEDICARE VIOLENT.""

As though forcing people use GoFundMe pay insulin violent.

""OMG LOCKDOWNS VIOLENT.""

Remaining open forces high risk people unsafe situations ultimately end diarrhea hose shoved arses COVID cause unrelentless diarrhea poors like spigot filling bath tub. force work, unable pay bills, leaving children orphans we've created system uses orphaned children sex trafficking.

A lockdown - everyone paid stay home safely - allows us health care workers adequately care patients seems lot less violent world.

And find weird actually define violent systemic processes violent unless becomes law.

I think that's good ethical framework. think that's cruel violent framework.

My approach saves lives define violence. approach takes lives see violence.

Stranger, understanding violence bizarre. Apparently short masks too? static thing bit rhetorical, direct, apologize.

I'm arguing many unknowns make correct call start all. certainly think masks mandated back February. imagine public outcry would even worse moves point. Look much resistance lot data (and deaths). Pardon digression.

I may also misunderstood underlying sentiment initial response, apologies well. right here. employees likely church attendees. churches, all, following CDC guidelines. upvote spreading reasonable information. Like number deaths Sweden supposedly explode ""next two weeks™""? Let's send school yay.
/s obviously.

My daughter brought home school beginning March last week school.

She cough smell taste otherwise fine.

Our Typhoid Mary 16, turned 17 recently. phobias medical conditions? 3 ways deal vaccine comes 

1. Leave economy open people actually part lower transmission ( best way )

2. Weeks, months long lock down

3. USA Karen method Deaths went Hi guys, I'm reporter travel journo based Mallorca, Spain. I've done comprehensive report channel situation right now. interested, check below: would choice food natural. obese people eat laboratory created food Hopefully start seeing Alabama's mask mandate take effect numbers, within next couple weeks. Sorry fauci fraud. People easily forget says masks don’t help, lied people died Yeah don’t get Trump hasn’t realized fucking federal government officials organize good national response would thousands times better reelection whatever fuck tried. 

He's control pandemic response, though.

He's puppet conspiracy nuts feed views cable television programs, cable television conspiracy nuts side virus. (Cable TV, plus talk radio extremist sources info, like Ben Garrison cartoons.)

The country's response really pushed along guys like Alex Jones, worst possible way respond real disaster. That’s wild assumption. generalizations site top, yet bet you’d first arms someone said generalization wasn’t true you... masks sweden rest scandinavia  look Doug Ford.

Before COVID hit, stupidly unpopular Ontario. tried reducing Toronto's city council trying get rid individual Councillors scuffled time council, cut sorts funding education, basically typical things conservative governments piss people off. COVID hits, Doug actually listens experts crafts COVID policy based say, people Ontario like lot used to.

And bring Doug Ford he's compared Trump constantly since became Premier.  may worst case count county.. pushing 1k cases. town live 1/5th total cases county cases though. New York reached peak coronavirus deaths early April, around 8th 12th.

Their peak official cases came almost exactly time. official case numbers lagged actual peak infection, testing inadequacies. COVID-19-projections estimates New York cases peaked around March 18th.


So lag New York 3.5 weeks. Nothing happened would support lag cases deaths stretching multiple months. people Texas understand cause effect right thing November? Goya brand beans* You’re exactly right. We’re lucky they’ve taken HUGE steps, really faced critics changing name Aunt Jemima brand, Washington Redskins etc. 

It’s honesty feeling like slap face point. started looking like movement little acts feel political point, they’re receiving pushback fed agents abducting people. wonder much push something gives

I deleted rewrote probably 6 paragraphs couldn’t boil mind single, solid talking point apologize rambling *it infuriating* “It took country 98 days reach 1 million cases, 16 days go 3 million 4 million, according tally.“

That’s pretty alarming. wonder long take us go 4 5 million. White House begun intercepting/screening positive case count numbers? act like done deal get reelected. He's going Biden. already going around mental decline possible dementia. Add fact ""win"" last election, Hilary lost. thing could likely happen again. watch video little that. They'll call county health inspectors get numbers enough data publicly available. am.... I'm unemployed pandemic write representatives fight UBI duration pandemic, mandatory hazard pay essential employees, Medicare permanently. 

You 1,000% talking ass deserve every downvote received. Sure, schedule appointment, drive there, get painful injection, pay front, deal side effects, schedule second appointment week two away second injection, repeat previous steps, still need mask go public places even assuming vaccine 100% effective doesn’t need boosters. 


Or wear inexpensive, abundantly available, relatively comfortable mask leave house around people. 


Masks vastly convenient less expensive appear effective could expect vaccine be. Look Germany Asian countries. wish know three million anything, NYC model successfully combat virus. much better position 3-4 months ago. advice doctor said don’t know can’t get twice. Right everything think know virus keeps changing almost daily. Assume worst take precautions don’t afraid live life either. Use mask, use hand sanitizer, wash hands, don’t touch face, avoid large crowds use common sense. seems best advice I’ve heard anyone diluted. interesting piece is: apple predicting outbreaks, keep focusing boring stuff instead, like: apple doesn’t get revenue retail stores. Okay... you’re it, maybe talk apple produces, maybe history company, gotta throw weird super bowl ad, talk iPod explosion don’t make anymore, apple 2, Tim Cook’s origin story. Could even throw origin viruses, evolution. Let’s make thing Netflix series. 3 seasons baby young wasnt issue... obese was, people need stop glossing Yeah, wanted make sure point graph starts linear view unless change it. Could TL;DR me? Yep. college, got flu least every year even though never went big frat parties went uncrowded bars 1 2 friends. I'm sure got sit lectures fools party time. flu since graduated almost 3 years ago. fall gonna nightmare.   Bit stupid theory. virus massively disproportionately kills elderly infirm. mean insensitive way going sound, country whole 'fitter' compete ravaged virus before.  mean, engineers bad running businesses.

The problem business becomes important product, feedback loops slow/ineffective engineering side.  Isnt Fauci guy knowingly lied said ""masks arent effective"" doctors nurses could get first, even doctors chance dying covid nil (unless they're boomer doctor)? wonder many seniors died selfish prickjob, hard really say. average age death high virus, lord knows hasnt done anybody favors. Let's keep listening though, seems like really level headed honest person. first thought crisis lie American people, that's really someone want put trust in. Instead putting aside half masks seniors, half doctors nurses, something intelligent person could cooked up, nope, better lie get people killed. finally clicked me, right now, reading months later trump got wrong. Trump looked *you* interpreted Americans scared him, softball sense ""Americans look president hope, say literally anything positive right now"" Me? Depends protocol. I'd hospital written out. example, worldometers 146.5k design... Trump handlers know can't win fair election. lock November. Secret police control streets. New head post office sabotage mail voting swing areas. Democracy dead unless shut country protest enablers resign. trump bragging test 🙄 Yeah don’t say   Hillary huge lead hours election ehh, data supporting refuting either takes Starr County part Texas likely thinking about. voted 79% Clinton 2016. still options knowledge. Thanks response. think correct thinking long get world vaccinated think nearly close first world countries get it. way areas easier access best medicine also easier quicker access vaccine. ton pressure produce much economic issues pandemic causing. know anything. mean, extremes either direction are, right? Uggh much dumb jokes Reddit Hey least they're wearing masks. /s Trump banned China would least 5x many cases now. Stop acting like Fauci genius. Germany, there's software company hundred employees management owner. man saving management wages sells hierarchy-free workplace. Remember 4th populous state 1000 deaths/day? three populous states getting outbreak whole country around 1000 deaths per/day. progress, idk results aren’t even reliable point we’re getting false negatives massive rate docs overrule tests since re-testing takes long matter quick tests issued unreliable.

It happens. It’s good thankfully good judgment one work around :) boggles mind, people say research changed masks. need look Taiwan South Korea curbing cases. Also, lets ignore medical professionals wearing masks centuries. solutions tried - like controversial zinc ionophores. hydroxychloroquine bad use Hinokitiol - natural zinc ionophore kill you... like news media! ""you wear a... Hold on, got word kim kardashian hooking ja rule!""

at least elongated muskrat try start entire thing mars COVID TESTING - Specimen Collection??????
Hi, I’ve searching everywhere understand guidelines healthcare workers collecting COVID specimens/tests. I’m finding vague information regarding PPE requirements. test coming up, company used seems questionable. ideas find specific information? I've seen masks continually falling cover mouths. person putting food bags time. Luckily area hard hit others, I've stopped picking Chick-Fil-A it. I'm obsessed food, worth end. gd church people screw everything. Apparently got shit ton ignorant people walking around country....Holy shit. Either disillusioned....im sure complicated. mean, yes, general, really work agenda item here, since nobody's profiting enough maintenance make enormous economic hit. They'd rather pay little less health insurance possibility denied treatment, rather pay little universal healthcare Agreed. Knowingly not, strings pulled. That’s actually legit good idea. need people whose job shit like it. It’s cashier’s stockperson’s job deal belligerent customers. heard kids taste like apples. Yes likely true. enough show significant increase deaths? time tell Bold think re-election prospects way diminished wear seatbelt? bother people going die anyways, right? mean, seek health maintenance? We’re going die anyways. 

Arguing preventing death really weird stance. 0.0001% chance die every time walked grocery store, think take step back figure what’s going on? “Not enough people died” isn’t justification ignore deaths. Still better working school kids sent school sick crowded. would get pandemic without run risk killing someone love. Triage technical term Yeah, 250 6'0"", no. He's 239 6'3"". Hahahahaha. Whitehouse petition. Good one. 2 week-ers new flat earth-ers. It’s unfortunate really downplays extended suffering people virus undergo, even survive  Everything recist dog whistle far left. Point can't social distance gathering thousands. live small town Texas 10 cases covid since March. town people screeching street months things seem fine us called democratic hoax early. Can't backpedal save people, make money, know president. solution kind national leadership stops passing buck blaming local leaders, hospitals, families, etc, STILL NOTHING HELP. That's place start anyway. Actually let science experts influence policy national level provide leadership support midst it. that, base would blindly follow him. could said anything wanted base would follow it. gone full containing get go would wide spread conformity contain this. everyone would forget shit would go history one beat 2020 pandemic. Instead remembered utter failure insidious incompetence displayed. It’s 24-48 hours (Illinois)... it’s choice delays. keep hearing people say winter gonna really bad. gonna really bad? bad could potentially be? idea schemes would different teachers. Looks like pulled article. look Iran hostage crisis alive understand Carter lost. speech help main reason.

Sure played role. Arguably last nail coffin. look Carter popularity dropped right malize speech. lot reasons. CDC specifically recommending beginning certainly help. 

Again people back we're hoarding masks, deserve healthcare workers. fact lie right thing proved point.  one dishonest misleading headlines I've seen while. 68% think school reopen capacity. Obviously, school reopening would require masks, temperature checks waivers families. sake almighty economy, must sacrificed parents return work. anyone else potentially infect.

Blood blood god! Ok, don’t start licking doorknobs see it’s real tell us, brought /those/ conditions? really would hitting states countries protests everywhere. hitting states never took lockdown seriously. shit predictable keep spreading protests talking point take away pathetic leadership. would think that? He's notoriously bad businessman history scams failures. Tbf breathing ventilator probably pretty easy cus ventilator work you. fuck poll? exclusively polled parents essential full time jobs results would different. meant facebook PhDs. I've seen many them. barely 2016 independents broke towards him. He's pretty much pissed advantage turned lot said independents. can't double cult expect make numbers.

Trump's aim win going limiting voter turnout much possible. Even though, think it'll enough, given badly he's polling swing states broke 2016. REALLY mangled reelection chances COVID response.

Is Biden great? really, looks like second coming Jesus compared now, lot people, that's good enough.  wondering anyone opinion masks required senior living (55 plus) community spaces. (the board directors cooperative) requiring masks halls community spaces along lot activities discontinued. residents careful, limit visitors building residents go essentials. 70 adults ages 65 98. We're thinking say hallways etc need wear masks time. ideas? independent living nursing assisted living facility. Holy cow. ~~Science~~ Math care believe not!  Would apply outdoors restaurant sitting arrangements well? packed ones w/out masks! Ikr? Europe despite much various porous borders, too, that's incredible thing. Except going win November. Bottom line, voter enthusiasm, lead counties matter. hate him, realistic Oh, forgot 18 Covid-19 automatically result death. Hey lets send kids school learn science listen become experts thier respected fields. Republicans thinking. ""You said worst mortality rate world best!"" living Twilight Zone? know War Worlds (a virus leading species downfall), sci-fi horror element none less. plot twist gonna virus actually benevolent, kill us destructive, ignorant humans? listened scientists could beat it, would mean we'd intelligent caring. Yes, rare. Yes, many children contract COVID fine.

But thousands become ill died. It’s worth reopening schools avoided. 20 hour delay fetching comments.

Some people still believe it’s ruin Trump’s precious economy. 

People didn’t take mask-wearing seriously recently Nah, real reason republicans want economy hurting bad is. never wanted part country close would rather see us take long term economic effects meant seeing downturns election. care making sure lose power it. Trump issue, never been, republicans. rogue sheriffs Washington State too. that, recall effort begun sheriff county. least one bowl help lower cholesterol... That’s true nobody placing blame Fauci can’t recognize mistakes early pandemic won’t recognize mistakes made along. It’s possible respect someone expertise still critical mistakes.

(Or read outset! ago, could new info.) Dom already throwing bus Listen [full masks important, someone infected prevent infecting someone else. People walking around masks...there's reason...It might make people _feel_ better, providing perfect protection people _think_ is. think masks, think healthcare providers needing people ill.

It's clear advocating people need get masks due misunderstanding masks work well wanting take away already deplenished stockpile.

Having said that, wording odd definitely attributed misunderstandings folks like have. taken approach like: ""We beleive masks effective preventing spread, want people buying mask supply. put full efforts federal government replenish stockpile."" mean boring answer scholars agree Exodus historical account all. Sorry lay everything feet Trump absolving self responsibility.

Everyone told need yet refuse. 

If Trump told people kill kids people went killed kids would lay 100% blame Trump? 

Yes Trump complete total fuckwit yet absolve people responsibility earth makes think cancer deaths recorded?

See comment above. Cancer's 1600ish deaths per day USA Covid today, less Covid back April time August over. Gen Z+Boomer=Zoomer completely agree. sad disgusting. sure looks like country burning ground, maybe rebirth. new starting point. Maybe get representation taxation around 3000 deaths (9-11) enough declare war country, 150000 enough make wearing mask mandatory?! guess there's money/oil gained Edit- never mind, don’t feel like arguing arrive late happy hour mean served.

As investor knows, past performance guarantee future results.

Florida first case arrival early March, several weeks first US case arrivals January.  course Florida late party.

Most people understand basics risk assessment. question one done far, exposes risk.

It’s political thing. people engaging active personal political choice flaunt see left wing “restriction” “freedoms” doesn’t matter rich poor, educated uneducated, it’s politics. Also “traditional” family isn’t positive thing. isolation people small family groups instead certain level communal living actively alienating part social society. traditional family structure literally can’t plan five minutes ahead. think problems object permeance. well changes outdated offensive things mentioned better changed sure, overall systemic deep seated flaws rich controlling poor middle class vanishing still major issues. understand point actions taken little slaps wrist that, wait see magically corporations absolved legally accountability regarding covid health workers, comes next courtroom near you.

Oh god another reddit scientist you’ll pay premium, believe amazon still selling p100 filter replacements non-medial staff less regular price. think complicated that.

It's question exactly measured say ""positive rate"".

I walking someone yesterday essentially able boil simple example like this.

Take hypothetical county, Floridaman County, population 8, following daily results:

**Monday**: Frank Florida tests negative, Fran Florida tests negative (OP: 0% positive rate, Florida DOH: 0%) 
**Tuesday**: John Florida tests negative, Jane Florida tests positive (OP: 50%, DOH: 50%) 
**Wednesday**: Frank Florida tests negative, Fran Florida tests positive (OP: 100%, DOH: 50%) 
**Thursday**: Bill Florida tests negative, Betty Florida tests negative, John Florida tests negative, Fran Florida tests positive (OP: 33%, DOH: 25%) 

... on.

So **Wednesday**, OP considers Frank Florida ""duplicate"" tested negative previously include test result. Florida DOH sees new test include test result.

So OP measuring ""positive rate"" ""the percentage people tested negative tested positive today"" Florida DOH measuring ""positive rate"" ""the percentage total tests reported today positive.""

Of course got yelled downvoted place yesterday asking questions think important understand context reports. Alabama doesn’t come fast learning state, I’m sure numbers huge start taking seriously. Sheer unadulterated stupidity Given plenty places reporting 30% total cases entire epidemic, last 2 weeks, really surprising.  


For example, look [Phoenix, reported 33k last 2 weeks total 100k. funny political positions exactly eat Seattle, wait drive thru test. Well, scheduled online next open spot two days later. Spent maybe 10 minutes line. Lots cars though freaky thinking people there. surreal. questioned everything healthcare workers head (I question hell know). roll window hand vial name say pull give guy face shield. makes small talk pretty successfully damn hard do. hands kleenex trades vial.

Oh yeah, story (someone cross post ADHD subreddit please Imma continue story definitely forget to) 

They give QR code long alphanumeric code check results. said call positive turned phone become ""case"".

I checked website every hours wife made me. 72 hours later almost minute, results available. said ""not detected"". 

TLDR: Seattle, WA Scheduling two days out. Line test 10 minutes. Test 2 minutes. Results 3 days. Well could 'working' vaccine (FDA standard ~50% effective good luck first market) year two might help 50% willing try? half let nature run course. Japan lol Yay 5 8 year old Oh, getcha. makes sense.

Thank you! took dog park couple blocks morning. Took advantage nice weather weekday. park *packed* evenings occasionally go mornings hot. I'm El Paso TX, shitty desert city exist, fucking hot here.

There group like 20 people working out, social distancing. stuff pairs going around big circle different exercises grouped together, one point woman started running directly finishing jumping jacks partner. Looking right me.

I +120lb dog, I'm 95lb, dog well trained, woman suddenly running directly us making eye contact mask, dog freaked caught us guard. still understand ran weird angle towards dog smiles us I'm scrambling back get way. breathing heavy working running large dogs unknown them?

People fucking stupid. restricted conservative areas. El paso blue. There's stupid people everywhere. shutting economy months Yeah headlines typical propaganda. Look closely poll find parents ( important non parents also polled business polled) believe children go school restrictions place think go back all. neighborhood wealthy folks seem keeping kids home, resources. Hell, types people heading vacation areas work remotely. It’s like holiday them. Poorer uneducated people don’t voice decision paying higher price worse access good education.  leader influence friends care lead action example... that’s best way help situation... claiming ok relaxed actions months in. Make personal change example others...  don’t understand state.

Signed,

Northern California (...Southern California sending us overflow patients) Ah shoot see lost me.

I’m sure seeing candidates *require* two doses. Oxford vaccine I’m paying attention 90% people phase 1/2 trials developed antibodies cells one dose. proposing trials two doses, best guess, get approved quickly possible, explicitly said explore perfecting dosages.

The FDA set benchmark 50%, means approve vaccine 50% effective higher. reflective opinions/estimates current vaccine candidate. He's walking fine line ensuring keeps job speaking realistically. even help much he's involved briefings such.

That’s point initial comment. understand lied masks, trying manage shortage among medical professionals so, made worse mistake affecting public perception led uncontrollable community spread. need critical misstep understand effect going chance managing public health crisis effectively. Fauci hardly first unlikely last scientist damages reputation order facilitate Trump administration’s narrative need skeptical “science” touted administration regardless credible messenger may seem.

It’s like everyone forgot Hurricane Dorian. even backs that, stick wouldnt Infection cases disease cases?

Infected mean sick.

Infected mean disease.

The majority infections asymptomatic clinically meaningless. 

Why hard understand? Masks shown effective respiratory virus prior pandemic. Masks worn 1918 Spanish Flu. Masks worn Asia since SARS outbreak 2003 beginning pandemic, effectively controlled spread. Yet US failed take accounts, chose reactive instead. not-well studied statements excuses. don’t need wait long time double blind placebo randomized controlled study make decision rapid spreading pandemic. Yeah look studies lock downs, every study shows cumulative harm done quality life whole worse shutting economy especially disease low mortality rate among 60 generation. let narcissism wipe *legitimate* reelection prospects. 

FTFY. He's impeached broken law literally every turn presidency - think entire party would stop short election fraud. wearer, enough.

Why cause others take extra risk possibility death instead right thing?

And qualifies claim valved masks enough experts saying don't?

Personally lot experience PPE working aviation inspector charge clean rooms ensure proper PPE worn would contaminate environment. 

Guess meant exhalation valved? 

I look forward hearing qualifies tell scientists wrong large bypass valve making masks less effective.

[Educate self. valve better dick nosing  even read article? would nice could bring back jobs, artificially bringing back jobs economically better alternative jobs done overseas simply sustainable long-term. agree UBI, it’s frightening many people site think government needs pay civilians nothing, also find disturbing people understand UBI would value dollar everybody would suddenly money available spend. 

UBI people skills ambition want life. form airline. call ""dollar general flights"" something 4k die fucking shit Yes, actually. Also anything related embalming would too. Youre dilusional I'm original person replied to. wanted know point was. Lmao supposed get bariatric surgery May got pushed COVID. 

I terrified, there's much wear mask lose weight slowly, hoping eating better helps. stupid won. stupid won.

No one wins scenario. still working happy be... Best what, treating like flu? Last saw proper mask usage reduces risk 65% .

So think mask makes invincible, go time, stay long time out, point risk wear mask limit outings.

I saw TV actress got COVID said got one time went outside without mask.  That's really mindset lot young people think.  wear mask one time, I'm danger; wear one, whatever want 100% safe.

We still need stay home.  Even before. I’ve advocate food industry decades. I’ve seen first hand point cause future cravings feed you. government pays via farm bill makes sedentary citizens. said masks aren’t effective didn’t know much virus, wasn’t big problem now. There's lot ""camps"" that. still remember first hospitals didn’t want employees wear masks would “scare patients” funny bet scum bags pushing shit get work safely home employees die. Fuck healthcare system. Ok you’re racist, got Yeah, two weeks wait test, 1 week result way get rid virus entirely would either tiny outbreak contained never chance spread initial outbreak (ie SARS) near 100% vaccination rate one spread dies (ie Smallpox).  initial containment opportunity failed need hope 100% vaccination rate. Antivaxxers keep thing around sort like measles eliminated instead rebound. Oh man, fanta menace gonna like this. Especially Betsy came talking bullshit kids stop virus.  think it’s catchy. know actual medical workers fighting COVID?? 


I heard single one say enough PPE, personally know 5 nurses 2 doctors working COVID wards every single one complaining since March rationing PPE two can't even get properly fitted N95s particular size keeps running out.  


This new, hundreds articles MONTHS now, doctors nurses lying, they're part conspiracy, truth we've never enough PPE EVERYONE ration. richest powerful country world, we're rationing PPE times even medical care itself. total failure matter rationalize it. Cases ticking EU, mostly ""imported"" cases Bengalis, Indians, Africans rather awful community transmission, still problem. Note Europeans freaking planning force children ""remote learning"" fall. Americans remember ""only thing fear fear itself."" fear virus may worse virus itself. John, need updated status canary.

Bill, keep telling canary died months ago!

So everything still holding stable. Good, thanks John. Exactly said would happen. heart broken don’t envy nursing home directors. easy decisions make.

I imagine isn’t easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. 

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can’t help care like usually do, volunteers aren’t allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don’t anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don’t even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

The highest risk also negatively effected shutdowns. yet he's going baseball game tonight throw first pitch welcome start baseball season... fact surely embarrassing throw going be. 2 month old account plenty divisive comments.

I'd imagine vast conspiracy would least garnered FCA complaints. Well mean, could probably find 1-10 people support lot radical things... Sports totally rigged, entertainment Also basic cognitive abilities, people still going around fabric masks. happen live intersection major street take travelling hospital Texas Medical Center vice versa.

Yesterday (as Tuesday July 22) saw six heading away TMC one heading towards, seven total. Four six time.

Last week saw two ambulances pull apartment complex across street. left hour later.

Overall feel like I'm noticing ambulances working home can't confirm may normal. doubt though, feels eerie. nailed it. can't convince people facts, change arguement new nonsense attack something else. False flags, crisis actors, gaslighting, fake news, else fails rely ""faith"". painful... 100% safety correct. There's always going non-zero risk, know duration contact important factor. fast food, employees spend like maybe 10 seconds food risk, non-zero, much much lower employees spending hours multiple days row. reach certain height, people even worse idea overweight normally do. 245 6’4” felt awful, people still thought thin average spread out. 

In general, Americans bad visually assessing what’s healthy many us overweight. high end overweight. dude straight morbid. bed ratio. Something like 50000 beds 10000 covid, 10000 available, leaves majority 30-40 thousand normal everyday use. may limiting stuff, non essential whatever less dire fat trim. Sounds like business usual unless covid. Idk they’re turning away people dire need like gun shot victims they’re old unlikely survive. Europe double number people per area compared usa(2x people pretty much area), usa way cases europe combined. huge fail usa, look actual presidential powers exercised actions federal state agencies, would look much same. would less tweets less pearl-clutching articles them. heard could something blood type. That's nice, it? buy that? also pretty sure going everywhere soon Italy bad outbreak.

Fair, also said also pretty sure going everywhere soon Italy bad outbreak.

Which gave opposite vibe me. Biden gets elected blame Dems economy, unemployment rate, budget debt. July 1 roughly 250,000 excess US. incredible drop auto accidents. Workplace accidents school shootings.... last one terrible thing include ‘Murcia! True Nordics suppressed disease well enough without masks.

But sadly past two weeks, trend *slightly* Denmark terms caseloads. probably due NPI fatigue mostly, unusually cooler weather July many border reopenings. Masks may help keep spread declining. new research indicates masks help reminding people keep distance: That's genius, much end actually paying you? Yes. believe benefit things believe important worth risks. exactly way people believe benefit believe important worth risks. pandemic. Yeah fucked way did. I’m Swedish can’t go around making comments whether it’s due cultural issues terrible leadership, confidently say America it’s clearly science one. government overreach far willing allow authoritarism go. Government people people. people want wear masks going to. two really frightened someone wearing mask stay home. walk around bubble. expecting conformity society praises non conformity. unfortunately agenda individualism top dog world today. open box put back in. care eachother. even though might say know really care end day maybe key family members life.

Our healthcare system proof. want pay SRS anymore want pay OCD control issues. thus taxes get system suffer severe mental health issues can't afford get help for. go debt get sick. roads potholes Swiss cheese. Where's foundation trust respect eachother actually supposed come from?

Let know follow lengthy scientific process gather years data wearing mask actually prevents anything cause people develop issues lack oxygen. Breathing particles mask etc. can’t tell you’re sarcastic not, let’s get straight. 

Did China behave irresponsibly? Yeah, almost certainly. 

Is China responsible scale outbreak US? Absolutely, irrefutably no. acted like responsible government real would fraction is. 

China may started fire, threw gasoline it. Yeah, Menard's mandated mask wearing stores since Spring (April?).  started it, hired security guards stand entrance nobody gave employees shit. customers used it, need security guards anymore. kinda agree one lol Last time checked NJ worst death rate per 100,000 world. 

No go guess. First doubt got coronavirus, especially since that's high infectivity. however make worry people thinking simply annual disease wave beginning school year. Lots confusion sure. Also, remember buy home terribly accurate, freak it. importantly, let cause call dr even feel fine, **do let reassure feel bad.**

 use it, become familiar reads you. get reading start nine, call dr. feel awful, call dr.  right agree wide variability test result turnaround time. understand person willing self-isolate indefinitely (e.g. me) fine taking laggiest test (I'm going either way). people surgery scheduled need quick result know safe go under, people need instantaneous (or least timely) results. data still unfucked long collecting data organize reflect date test given date results returned. means data can't fully unfucked long laggiest test results take come back.

I wonder much private labs supporting sports ""bubbles"" (ironically) hyper aggressive white house testing sucks resources contribute wider delays. say ""no use private lab contributing lag"" still fight resources process (e.g. solvents) saying 'we use private lab worsening lag time' bit like saying ""Well bought n95 masks steal hospital fault shortage"". they're still consuming finite amount resource, still part there's enough resource actively symptomatic people utilize.... about: 

""Daddy, where's mommy?""

""Oh, infected made suffocate death. *cough*""

But, hey, children survive even new orphans adopt unlucky lost child! Seriously, UK media used pictures like demand people go back work, going beach equal level risk spending 40+ hours week office, factory, warehouse. Either doctor know thousands miles looks like hospitals US east coast, middle Pacific Ocean Canada folks home El Paso. suppose get certain amount extra funds government support COVID patients. Due less “paying customers” hospitals overall. would biden help? idea answers to. know food safe, customers way careless handling packaging. need assume person wrapped sandwich virus, act like wrapper automatically clean. Ugh mess People like gonna selfish assholes matter need wear fucking masks! really know.... anyone graph 7-day average positivity rates states? Fact 1 100 Americans it. stopping now. Right, saying quotes attributed him. saying involved. you’re admitting view it’s uniquely American problem? dying though. Yeah good point number sounds ridiculous. went back actual “study” it’s self reported survey people feel, category includes people sometimes living paycheck paycheck. see problem source information numbers blown proportion.   Im really sure reply “the numbers accurate die gunshot wound test positive counting Covid death.” 
At point end conversation TBH though, England shaped Johnson got COVID, made stop contradicting NHS every breath (pun intended). Can't play something sidelines weeks end hospital it. new system set TeleTracking, private company based Pennsylvania, awarded $10 million contract non-competitive bid April.

Thank you. phrase discourages depresses people point saying ""F it, I'm going out"" Seems like struck nerve. Sure, could clearer. think get main point still stands - disease severity linked blood type. Chinesium syringe, sure, I’ll tell nightmares, people lost loved ones cause bunch idiots pretending freedom extends spreading virus like human plague rats stupid put mask listen experts Smoking general really stupid ;) Thinking outbreak ""waves"" big mistake. think ""idle"", burning communities constant rate collectively wise common sense practices; staying home/distanced possible 100% mask wearing not. sub act like anybody doesn’t wear mask... kind ignorant, selfish asshole.

Yeah. Live life endanger others process. hard concept. read high mortality part due successful Canada keeping people alive long term care would already died due conditions lived countries. vulnerable population due success keeping seriously ill people alive longer. said could done better. 150k graves looks like white dots green. thought weren’t listening experts anymore though? *laughs Asian* Germany same. One Monday recommendation everyone wears them. next saturday nobody wearing them. next Monday become mandatory fine everyone wore them. I’m Virginia. I’m pretty sure state dashboard info demographics tab. add, day 14 90° plus weather Washington DC metro area. uncomfortable? Yes. still it? Absolutely yes. start feeling personally whiny sweaty making me, think retail workers healthcare workers option take hours end stuff whines away. occupied French Japanese.

YIIKES live liberal I'm still surrounded racist science denying townies. can't imagine bad must elsewhere country.  There's subreddit r/maskskepticism maybe read understand.  corrected, people's excuse wearing mask? lying said masks help, he's saying masks help, mean he's telling truth? can't lying two statements complete opposites other. One must true. work already told come back outside risk window. can't economy virus crazy smoking still legal. Well, cases start coming stop coming salads, uneven heating. 60 deg C hot enough inactivate short time cooled down. That’s assuming Trump actually let someone take control anything. That’s problem thinks knows anyone doesn’t know shit. topic entire thread serious one? happens every sub gets annoying seeing ever comment section! Latelys serious post Reddit 3+ threads pure memes discussion. wonder much site targeted.  Maybe dumb maybe I'm not, least I'm saying others well  Yeah thought H1N1 still vaccinate today.... total inferred infections close achieving herd immunity.... every single hotzone long way magical 6o 70% mark. theoretical statistic.

Case numbers today importantly positivity rate, shows large &amp; fast contagion spreading. Keep mind, right we're back April, limited testing. we're screening Everyone PCR swabs, obvious symptoms. means double-digit positivity rates accounts ppl could well need treatment ER ICU. many hotspot areas they're flooding hospital systems, reported they're resorting triage turning sickest away die home. I'm compassionate person agree you. shed new light many people care little others health. could now, least way getting it, free country wreck please. is, stop acting like nothing people improve instead blaming politicians. like claiming drug addicts problem drugs, drug dealer sells them. Still looking Waldo though. I'm talking March thought 9 months He'll one hell great story tell now... wonder news network cover that, cross ""live"" nightly updates? It’s killing Americans faster civil war did. Sorry fauci fraud.

I'm guessing know nothing career People easily forget says masks don’t help

I'm going paste previous comments topic here:

----

There two main issues conflating:

1. know
2. knew advised against

So, knew early (and pretty obvious) wearing masks certified fine particulates would filter viruses fell within tolerances.

What know nation-level impact general, low-quality mask use public. data influenza SARS strains said much back Feb March. April rolled around started get data nations vastly different strategies other, became clear COVID-19 responded differently diseases widespread mask use.

This data published starting mid April late April recommendations changing.

This science works.

But knew using N95 masks like going protect individual (to degree, given things need protect yourself). specifically advised people use unless ill, conserve PPE medical professionals, generally right call. Even was, shortages.[Leung 2020]

With perfect hindsight, obviously would done things differently, one knew parameters disease early parts year. even critiques often pointed early new data adopted, [Greenhalgh US Centres Disease Control Prevention originally advised public wearing masks covid-19 pandemic, advice updated 4 April 2020.

There legitimate concerns early approach, published [Cheng Research also done pandemic mass masking compliance high enough effectiveness assessed. absence evidence effectiveness clinical trials mass masking equated evidence ineffectiveness. mechanistic reasons covering mouth reduce respiratory droplet transmission and, indeed, cough etiquette based considerations evidence clinical trials.

But concerns whole standard approach pandemic management, aberant way COVID-19 addressed.

There's doubt politicians get cut, obviously that's excuse trying squeeze poor countries little time. find money feed people, take long serious unrest revolt.

Dictators often get overthrown. Talk shit state Reddit!

Armpit America til die fam  hard say honestly. 

It's not. We're basically developed country completely unable taper number new cases down. Trump enough really hurt situation. take measures like China people would hate well.

Nope. Trump already shown literally anything fans continue support him. He's literally using unidentified federal troops arrest protesters, exact type thing China would do. hospitals, N95s mask covers go them. solution simple, rich get vaccinated everyone else fends themselves. Willful ignorance dying isn’t sad  go office day pick things up, boss told stay hour. made feel like going Chernobyl something.  Nah think it’s just

A: reddit really really hates fat people

B: died cus fat, I’m fine. mean bad point fact obese people high risk bad covid outcomes. can't fault there. petition based functional government acting good faith. cruel joke point.

Doing things something though, full support there. Also, [Catholic Hospitals account 15% Hospital Beds one anti-medicine religious groups. 

You mock people dying happened believe God. Hospitals insurance companies best interests vaccinate workers first. Hospitals work force. Insurance companies people working high risk environments like hospitals higher risk COVID want pay $100,000+ hospitalizations, push vaccinated first.

Anyways, yeah drive vaccination, doubt. infrastructure already built. make go away? think people able find drive options problem areas, addition Doctor offices hospital pharmacies whatnot. Think different places go get standard flu shot. Remember people think hoax hoax minor concern ravaged destroyed large sectors society ... nothing eyes . 


People decided wear masks succumb fear virus proudly facing welcoming . foolish naive think they'd like face virus boldly face forward. 


and best way exhibit type ignorant bravery something inform charge straight ahead. That's basic arithmetic left-wing scam.  Partially, cases outpacing testing, least according CEO LabCorp. never said sent protect federal buildings? example gave talked shootings Chicago. sent Chicago deal VIOLENT crime.

Nope. anyone part keep Americans safe, doctors nurses risking lives anybodies put mask.

But *is* tired tired seeing Reddit. China probably ship shit world. US buy Switzerland.  
And call Swiss Vaccine militarized federal agents. Yeah, numbers rise exponentially. cases know about.

I realize situation no-win Ford, would rather overly cautious risk people dying. cashier picture wearing mask valve.

[Face masks valves don’t stop COVID-19 bigger deal made educate public? What's point telling people wear mask satisfied wearing wrong mask? frustrating. really repost tho. Already sub's front page here: &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 shows seriously god damn stupid is. even 100% effective vaccine, need approx. 70% US get vaccinated order enjoy benefits herd immunity. Herd immunity prevents disease spreading rapidly, doesn’t mean eradication virus. bottlenecks production distribution (and ~30% country never voluntarily gets vaccinated one reason another) goal herd immunity one that’s reached slowly time it’s reached all. means businesses, order make customers feel safe, need require masks regardless local state ordinances. It’s like people going carry around vaccination cards even do, vaccines lose effectiveness time even people strong immunity still susceptible infection encounter large enough viral load immune system overwhelmed. recent measles outbreak, even vaccinated children getting sick, albeit much lower rate non-vaccinated children. 

A vaccine magic bullet lot people seem think reality masks going pretty common next two years longer. Good news. Cities every State shut borders.

I've got lot good friends China I've made lots money them, we're going let win comes virus."" think israel serbia could considered candidates. least got quite lot cases lately. cancel reopening, stand back blame protestors, anything. can't stop protests make measures strict minimise spread covid.

It's fair what's required.  every single one pays taxes spread diseases. know this. right. thinking long term. police gun refusing wear mask die content use force investigated. dont coworker always going 99% survival rate .0025 chance death. I'm like, ""tell 100,000 people died country since March."" Dr. Doom strikes again. What's it? Biochips every American? 5600+ death high enough? Also much cases Sweden, Sweden really bad glad turning better. still really picked bad strategy No, White House *is* thinking cinnamon toast crunch statement. 

That's part problem.  Rinderpest (also sometimes called ""cattle plague""), used kill fuckton cows. Everything fine. anyone tried chicken? wrong?? knew deaths shoot back 3 days row 1,000+ daily deaths. 

Meanwhile kept crowing low death rates.... crowing anymore see. also said New York great job. 

I unfollowed stupid thread, still home? Im done scared fear mongering groupthink thread... purpose starting now...... Population control 101 least freedom!!!  health experts  Funnily enough, word “restrictions” didn’t appear survey all. got choose from: open usual, open minor adjustments, open major adjustments, open all. forget also better medical treatments decreasing death rate. Much better chance patients hook ventilator pray best.  Canadian ""second wave"" much smaller current point Sweden's first wave.

Canada twice many new cases Sweden, nearly 4x population.

Come on, know this. dishonest? South Africa soon list. well MExico list one really tracking enough there. need federal vouchers now.

 Thank one 800,000 people who've contributed 23andMe COVID-19 Study. research team hard work analyzing data. far, preliminary results suggest people blood types 9-18% less likely individuals blood types tested positive COVID-19. 


While findings encouraging, could help accelerate research. know someone who's hospitalized COVID-19? eligible, DNA could help scientists search possible genetic links disease, potentially help fight it. We'll supply 23andMe Health + Ancestry kit cost.  think stores need either manager somebody gets paid little $7.60 hour standing entrance...not high school kid really doesn’t care. see apple data: track transmission well early phase. Now, masks all, seem much correlation left; least, Europe. Pirates global warming. They've also reported 27 deaths per day span exceptional. Maybe indoors stay yard. reasonable, done it, everyone one month would over. didn't.

If think BLM protests problem,you wrong. choosing see people disinterested social justice worse interested preserving status quo would perceive activities. Assembly unimportant(to them) reasons.

You arguing morons wanted racecar event literally saying protests ok therefore outdoor sports ok still confused. part protests, part covid problem. People die, partially fault. *SARS-CoV-2 resubscribed you.* think turnaround time dependent state in. state large amount cases prepared, testing time issue. Tankies. explanation needed That's Governor DeathSentence. Hahaha 18 year old walks door laughs trying ground them.. God, clicked article see Logan family. course was...

They really really top list scummy evil people.  That's distinguish people actual Celiac's Disease ones ""Celiac's Disease"".

I remember gluten free food became common sudden everyone Celiac's Disease. legitimate disease, question, would see people ""Celiac's Disease"" eat things actually gluten notice. person without disease wants avoid gluten that's totally cool people would make bothered me. think people bit psychosomatic thing/wanting special unique something.

I could wrong though, know whole lot it. mask mandate DC months. increases scope, point required wear mask basically second set foot outside door, requires businesses refuse service people wearing mask. much broader mask mandate many places have, response recent uptick cases newer science showing masks impact even thought. freedoms allow

So freedom blame? incompetent leadership ranging federal government governors mayors? Bye bye, billionaires. Please take celebrities politicians you. Real people die every day; especially older ones. 

Many people die could easily saved; especially children die malnutrition preventable disease.

Maybe lost time traveler That's ones reported. Remember Florida spike pneumonia deaths well. hope so, never know. live, everyone masked shops that's required state. take stroll park, see large numbers people playing sports (basketball baseball), one wearing mask. summer camps going. see parent spectators, although spaced out, see masks. need Alex Trebek, stat! tell bot what's what! Sure sweetie. No... keep thinking guesstimate, really. don’t understand said “that explains problems CDC”? January  Right? fact virus widespread Florida way ensure every staff member isn’t infected going work without daily testing 24 hour turn around. couple notable things NJ's mitigation measures implemented:

NJ first state statewide mask mandate.

And several points, NJ Governor Murphy pleasantly surprised issuing stricter mitigation rules even numbers trending better. helps us gets ahead pandemic. instance, recently expanded mask requirements lot outdoor situations events.

Too many leaders exact exact opposite: Things starting look good, let's ease restrictions! things turn back everybody surprisedpikachu.jpg. Rand Paul told optimistic! coronavirus gets scared trees start speaking america full OBESE unhealthy people think problem. Oh great. good news. 

I've started one occasionally due stress. nights can't, know? reason bad US cause handling ""flatten curve"" thing correctly. 5th highest deaths per capita world economy better neighbors far less people died. sure qualifies best

Also allowing novel virus burn population real understanding effects grossly irresponsible name three:

\- virus integrates DNA, that's HIV does.

\- virus DNA forms ring stays inside nucleus. That's herpes does.

\- virus mutates quickly immune system cannot keep up. That's Hepatitis C manages stick around. sick fucks outside northeast better stay tf away SNG001 future fighting Covid Mine like too, got 93 then. Remember medical grade devices get calibrated. like something isolating room covid symptoms knowing fine want expose spouse car going ER push it. one sworn reasons ""ethical"" grounds wearing mass UNETHICAL? course does.  It’s almost like link religion stupidity! 🤯 guy anti-cdc, anti-mask enforcement doubts case numbers accurate. hard work dumb rest us. They're dragging us forward lol falling apart years now. 

The last months revealed facade. 

Source: live US problem cases employers going want anything could cost customers, employees going risk getting fight possibly killed someone mask. police likely going anything. enforcing areas.

Fact really something needs enforced first place. point people smart enough know wearing mask helps prevent spread virus. society stupid that, there's enforcement, either start forcing people given trigger happy Americans are, current dislike police would disastrous, let people police themselves. Police country gun violence people actually willing murder another person told wear mask public area global pandemic. winning, Fortunate Son? simple fact say racist laughable. may need look mirror. Also, like contour talk logically undertake posting view, I'd happy share. may learn, Abe bettered it.. 😊✌ unverified er doc another sub said hit sustained 92 head er .... hot mess, best even maskers hope reduced viral load make antibodies. Thinking exposed worn mask ludicrous point. ever seen long 

I don’t know means, still know mean: winter coming. use smart phone/laptop/tablet? Wear Nike? Lots slave labor comes things. trying jerk, likely partake lot stuff things don’t stand for.

Edit: there’s one sub hates religion loves moral relativism, it’s apparently r/coronavirus. mean doctors pressured Mark deaths motorcycle crashes COVID death? 

Cause that’s happening... guys aware right? death anyone Covid system marked Covid death get funding sensationalize things. 

It’s pandemic flu. get exposed one immunity. it’s flu. risk flu stay inside. Face facts forest fire let’s get crazy. supposed headline? solution there? No. world isn’t always safe place like west coast college campus. Sometimes life sucks. Get healthier, eat better. That’s do. Oh work healthcare wearing mask type case anyone wanted jump me. kids don’t party, least won’t get infected classmates. Yeah thought going crazy started thinking Doug good job.

That said someone definitely slapped silly.

In early March taking virus seriously. fact told parents upcoming march break going perfect time travel airports less busy.

Then, sudden, press conference looks visibly shook he’s saying things like ‘my friends’ ‘we need listen experts’.

I’m glad came Ontario. still won’t voting him, would shocked maintains minority government despite absolute plummet popularity pre-COVID. tracking news sites asleep? went 60-70k daily cases literal 100k today. everyone forget drink coffee morning? Wtf? news? discussion? governor's hands alone, he's one shut down. Pretty much stance. take much effort either.

The way look pause life year two consciously avoiding vectors virus much possible give big chunk life even choosing ignore potential threats. Sry who? I'm unfamiliar Robespierre, plz clarify. Mine usually starts 95 goes 97 2 minutes so. least know baseline someone beat first time, unlikely worst second time. body already knows fight it. guess could still pass people never it. death rate going hospitals fill. Yet literally nothing done stop spread Antibodies required level immunity, though beneficial. long term presence antibodies indicates cells produce antibodies robust response another exposure.

In short, idea talking about. would parents get hospital? Would 6ou give ride? Yes? Bingo, that's get infected. I'm there. full shit. feel sick today getting tested two weeks waste ressourses. common nasal/throat swap based test works 7 days symptoms begin. (At first virus replicates throat lungs week lungs, that's ""false negatives"" come from) Thanks man. I've 2 months I've lost 16 pounds, I'm happy that. Still, daunting started 409, need encouragement get.  flattened going Gyms arent problem anywhere. people going least risk people are. 


Gyms Epicenter outbreaks.

&amp;#x200B;

These Officials mouthbreathing idiots dont understand nuance interested health population. Christ fake news people...some understandable maybe listen doctors health experts... Pay?? Hahahahaha believe so. Michigan plan screen screen learning first marking period, hopes possibly returning class rooms November. Double week bad trend quickly grow control without measures. returning normal majority population vaccinated, especially noone wears masks spend time indoors Fall Winter. would without online classes, don’t see hanging outside school opening school. weird calculated  contract option additional 500 million doses. Well estimate yeah probably ballpark working 7 days week. know gonna happen happening fast enough me. certainly seems like advanced countries got shit together, seem ones sensitive tell people whats what. Americans believe Tragedy Commons. private contractors  I've three colleges life. PNW far absolute worst I've ever attended. far worse community college went back lived TN. idea wrong administration PNW. 

So I'm surprised would floundering response Covid-19. There's bunch middle men collecting paychecks expense students real faculty (professors). case numbers indication texas florida numbers leveling off. would indicate death rate getting close peak, 1/5 peak. NY death rate go 30/day 1000/day 18 days. already said 2-3 weeks. Based data see, places reaching peak. great news! American logic assumes American logic. someone unironically claim mostly suicides people despair economy shit down. lack oxygen wearing masks. 

I can’t people Okay, check particular comment thread. responding someone else. really first thread addressing (and health issues general). Look happened time brought here, either considered mean inconsiderate downvoted oblivion. Even posted pictures, like thread, unfortunately show someone polar opposite ""healthy"".

People want live imaginery utopia bubble think real world (or thought was), realizing want face/address issues. read posts general sub elsewhere, many living bubbleworld sheltered. 

Like said two nurses street Covid ICU wings here. Almost covid patients unhealthy, obesity, smokers, name it, healthy maybe slight issues. know what's flooded covid units here, heavy smokers health issues regardless.

This raising awareness overall issue running rampant US obesity etc. eat perfectly clean, track macros (hell even cocktails entered haha), lift 5 days week, I'm active etc. You/anyone choice, 100% super clean eating, eat better general, track, become active. go example one favorite restaurants burger, fries, ribs reknown for, app known macros fit in. don't, may eat hell lot later easily go 1-2k range, that's obesity issues come play. Heck I'm almost 40 better shape 20s, blood work even shows that, still active obviously 20s.

It's breathe fresh air see talked sub without people disregarding ignoring. needs addressed. obvious reason one people would sabotage Trump's re-election. Make seem like world ending everyone's dying, make numbers magically better Biden comes office make seem like he's saviour.

Not saying believe that, saying would obvious conspiratorial approach certain groups would inflate numbers. Health experts reacting differently different. sure missing.

Care clarify last sentence? bit vague address without making lot assumptions. hear you, wish qualified it. There's study near me- but, qualify I'm currently work-from-home. 

My future ex-spouse still working public wearing mask. really starting think wants dead. So, would qualify study course want it. Yyyyyyup. going dive/climb pattern everyone wises staying home possible 100% mask usage not. LOL isn't. even close. take hillbillies time.

Also, protesters wear masks, they're fine, idiots hand not. mind, hope get fucking  I’m also Tennessee am, kids return next week well. Actually happens like media forms

Interviewer ""expert happen next?""

Expert ""we know depends lot factors""

Interviewer ""so could get much worse?""

Expert ""like said depends lot factors yes could worse""

HEADLINE : EXPERT SAYS THINGS GET LOT WORSE

It people ignore expert. According Daniel Griffin TWiV podcast, reports patients recently getting reinfected earlier year. least one case supposedly severe second time. 

If uncommon know yet. definitely possible get reinfected second time. criteria include probability survival?

Is fair admit patient ignored saftey precautions lieu patient best? predict looming (and successdul) lawsuits criteria probability survival.   7 days Georgia back june cases lot lighter they? get politics, democrat’s messaging terrible place. It’s big part problem. mean 4 months ago was. I'm tired trolls  come comments. Also region (Nee England) pretty good. It’s rest states issue Guys, finally starting get tired winning. Forreal. got math teaching position old conservative women retired. Seems like maybe COVID-19 isn’t hoax now, mrs. Faux? LMAO Hate begets hate suppose took one CVS July 7th MD, results yet... US government actually paying people's COVID treatments? find HRW talking US government covering treatment news cases patients receiving massive bills.

I'm US expert healthcare system can't find financial incentive claim COVID thing think country's assuming people COVID died COVID start outbreak. happened due lack testing capability start. Yup bet, cant believe de Blasio got rid all, undercover/plainclothes officers. That's like ultimate dream drug/gun dealers criminals. worry now. know whatever drugs guns selling arent cop. Getting rid undercover means much guns drugs streets, shootings, murders. Like come 1 year olds killed New York. Despite main stream media like CNN MSNBC trying make American public think ton New Yorkers want extra police presence city. want federal DHS police New York. Nowhere near big. result margin error. People's opinions entrenched now. Trump. take opposite picks bad guys perish. going guess middle Tennessee aware current situation regarding protesters here. backlog least important tests thus least likely positive, somewhere around 100k tests waiting right 7-15k per day cloth mask worn correctly least 2 layers densely woven fabric offers 65% protection certain studies saying. N95 offers 95% protection fitted correctly. That's reasonable view. America structurally poorly built contain epidemic. Absolutely insane upvoted. Come guys. makes even angry now. got home hospital spending two days ICU pulmonary emboli lungs. spent entire day diagnosed (from urgent care waiting ER, like 7 hours) mask FINE. harder breathe mask without. 

And no, didn’t get PE masks covid rather surgery combined birth control.  “masks save us” people may want look what’s happening Japan. Masks good intervention margins...but won’t move needle crush uncontrolled epidemic like USA. Coming soon Easter near you!

(working release date: 2022) murder 5000 citizens get there! stunning success /s Yes, years we’ve managed burn half population’s braincells mindless bs “culture” seeing happens.  Wow, rock first half 2020? People keep forgetting summer lull.

Winter lot, lot worse. anybody know trader Joe's carry lambs blood? they're free infect rest families. Fauci responsible thousands deaths. everyone luxury ability let remain isolated indefinitely, number parents actively let kids roam free play friends go camps etc right justify saying “kids don’t get sick” astounding. 

It's really nothing though - activity activity, location location, everything needs educated risk-benefit decision. 

Instead thinking ""can't keep kids locked forever,"" people thinking ""does kid need *this, here, setting?"" He's still going win.

I mean pro-Trump ""HE'S PRESIDENT"" way. hate human planet. he's going win. He's defied odds every single possible time, nothing makes November different. Especially dud like Joe. one joke though, happens literally every thread. Imagine people acted exact way bar church. think might disruptive people came church solemnity?

There reason subreddits exist; one saying tell jokes reddit. saying go correct room people currently telling jokes. bring open mic night funeral act like everyone else wrong clapping. like 12% barely read so.. yeah  go Republican stuff again, whole nation. Yes Trump horribly fucked don’t see you’re making political thing blaming Republicans. nation fucked unless start listening instead making vs thing. tired tired seeing Reddit. Fuck outta here. I’m tired normal political parties anyway, sides suck right it’s putting country danger it’s years imo. Read end... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Keep lecturing pal *super enlightening* *totally* changed mind. I'm *certainly not* going share inane diatribe subs mocking lol. Peons Maryland go month. Agreed. result inconsistent message US leadership. Usually want federal entity coordinating different states necessary keep states supplied deal differing amount cases one. Like general coordinating strategy people leading units. 

Trump peaced early said going leave states deal state leadership wanted to. left state fight states getting supplies, states took virus less seriously others. resulted patchwork response virus without border control states, making easy virus spread. 

Basically General assumed war would magically go away went go golf, nobody left charge could agree battle strategy. supplies fought bidding war platoons. GOD TOLD GO DISNEY RESPECT MUH ASMERICWAN FREEEDUMZZ!11

/S 2k day ... come share rest world though? worse edit something? Five Ideals Greed, Cruelty, Selfishness, Corruption, Deception. They're Abott like stand for, believe in, act out.

What witnessing ideal deception. liars, deceivers, truth them. So, cancer contagious? Try again. 9 deaths/day country never lockdown!

5702 deaths 5th highest death per capita world small country nearly visited France Germany.    
But today ""only"" 9 deaths (while neighbours 0 deaths/day weeks) yeah lockdown work. see kind logic. like say they're sent protect federal buildings, justifications necessary nothing federal buildings. Really makes ya think Masks absolutely required. Also, may want look air circulation buildings make sure air one unit go another unit without proper HEPA filtration. Florida's new cases hovering around 10k one day 15k. Florida reached testing capacity like positivity rate might suggest? hate Trump supporters would DIE him. think election close come November see. Where's people used ""we enough beds handle increase"" argument? never knowingly purposely put much strain hospitals... results ""doomers"" saw coming ignore tests want, explain extra dead bodies world due extreme shortage healthcare providers thanks Trump republican failure restocking national stockpile. cancer Mods, would possible add states flair instead ""USA"" ? mean, what's even point locks, criminals never gonna go away.

/s think people skewed perception obesity truly is. mom probably saw little chubby. I'm body shaming pro body-reality. levels obesity associated increased cause mortality. something country needs talk serious way. mean countries like Japan, whose second wave caused irresponsible US Marines? 100% true.... But, let's take moment perspective here. opposite side appears altruistic talking points... calculated consistent manner sides. said, care others mean rest us either.

Stop projecting lack morals everyone around you. Keeping schools closed wreck economy. Misinfo.

Although president repeats one. Ahh, okay. Thanks that. Dude. Even single screen, ctrl+c copy, alt tab switch ctrl+v paste. 

Hand writing??!! 340 6'1, god damn way 239 6'3 Thanks.

We're ok. noticed chronic fatigue syndrome flared till early July. 

Also exerted much dry cough returns mild night gone morning!

This really brutal immune system gonna nuts flu season returns. Nothing prevent someone getting both.
Even flu vaccine; 60% coverage.

Millions globally going living CFS/ME Meanwhile Ireland got 7 new cases. cases positively rate 0.03 Zero percent Texas full law abiding cowards. Texas farthest thing tough. guns show gun rights toughness behind that. Keeping schools closed wreck economy. Canadian here. We're verge fucking up. numbers spiking hit provinces experts saying need rollback reopenings leaders shove heads ass. think ok kill duty cop, single screw loose. really people psycho society. people bullying minimum wage teenager feel get away it, turns fisticuffs, feel like escalate win. trick bouncing make never start. Bullies go fight know lose. Bouncers literally state issued license allow get fights someone throws punch. trained. kick ass take names. Bullies know start. literally bouncer's JOB kick ass professional it.

To clear, appears breakdown something like this:

90% mask compliance grumbling, put foot MAKE (examples: Trader Joe's, Costco)

9% yelling Karens (They take advantage cowed teenager manning door)

1% actual altercations could stopped bouncer (violent fist fights throwing things)

&lt;0.0001% really violent situations require cop shoot someone

Think many millions people go stores day. Yet we've heard handful really violent outcomes. probably normal society general pandemic. made view violence gets clicks. blame media inflating issue. (My side example Telsa. drive Ford catches fire, never, ever makes news. every time Tesla catches fire, does. Teslas actually single safest car road large amount. media inflates importance rarity, makes think happens much often does.) Seems like countries politicized pandemic suffering worst virus. 

Virus’ don’t give fuck politics. That's nearly half China reported. trust CCP's number anyways. Obesity also like 100% chance cutting life short virus 0.5% something that’s primarily already old. 

Wish health officials told people go 1hr walks everyday eat healthy. It’d safe lives whether they’ve done thus far Borderline obese?

Trump morbidly obese. Trump could reelected recession. whole world recession could written black swan event. Screwing repeatedly covid hurt way more. think contradicts saying people unintelligent. Doesn’t common sense say people innately intelligent dumb it’s irrelevant education, non-maskers would even dispersed amongst world well educated non-educated? think you’re holding Rugged Individualism isn’t true. Humans aren’t good lone creatures. need learn understand, therefore intelligence community effort education. countries shit together government effort educate citizens enforce security precautions, goes idea people individually intelligent mask wearers dumb non-masker centralized government figure (the president republican enablers) isn’t responsible case numbers. think facts show worldview isn’t really practical. Lemme Captain Obvious here: best way avoid backlog carelessly letting outbreak get point processing can‘t keep infections Look man - logic it’s okay say minorities lazy statistically tend lower socioeconomic bracket. That’s blanket statement it’s true.

It fails recognize reasonable nuance situation. 

The problem isn’t black white. It’s shades grey.

Does country problem? Absolutely.

Is reasonable say every citizen entire country contributing collective problem? opinion. higher death rate per population US certainly bad feared. good news see sweden let's hope second wave never comes. 140k+ lives along way

We’ll lucky it’s 200k end year. Best case projections read predicted 1800-5400 deaths *per day* end August. Let repeat that, *best case projections*. testing gets worse is, contact tracing gets worse, infections continue growing, expect numbers double even triple. combined fact may underestimating number infections orders magnitude. I’m horrified country become now. horrified before, it’s like we’re relishing it. 3 days girlfriend st Pete begins.  Im US get fundamental level either. Seems like day moratorium asymptomatic testing would clear backlog many older teachers near retirement going put real difficult situation state's hasty decision reopen schools. talking Mom yesterday family friend teacher Sarasota three years away retirement, says state goes plans way go back work. 

What shame, devote whole career public education anticipating small comfortable retirement, retire early take less planned for. think she'll okay, they're two income house always fine economically far tell, people facing decision much tighter budgets? Even free (I good insurance) calling ambulance, going ER, etc huge drama, wakes people up, know going uncomfortable next god knows many hours days, know getting IV. really unpleasant proposition, even give dilaudid compensate. 1/4th population USA. 83 million vs. 330 million.

We still could better though, still around 500 new infections per day. Dow great! 

^/s  flip side 20% completely hopeless. Masks stop spread viruses.

Shame ""astonishingly vile"" basically administration's playbook. Good! need held accountable. wish this! Ohhh great Bill Gates. Lmao ofc look subversive self. Look gospel wealth real inspiration wealthy deaths start surging things become seriously scary. Idk man, live Florida. reopening phase joke, literally reopened everything back &amp; businesses following CDC guidelines. 2-3 weeks reopened fully cases started surging &amp; control. New York seems cut curve now, meanwhile Florida control all. Florida currently active cases once, higher country right now. Florida 389,000 confirmed cases New York 400,000, let remind New York far higher population Florida does.  COLORS RUN HOLES CLOSE Nuclear war among US, Russia China guaranteed termination human race. Mutual Assured Destruction, aka. M.A.D. election, need risk planet. However war Iran, Venezuela conflicts South China Sea still possible Trump last desperate resort election. wont thank us. hope.

Yes drivers already talking boycotting. trained lie American people? keep PPE supplies away vulnerable? course teaches that? scale 1-10, butthurt you? Another click bait journalist trying create death saying masks work. Thank [**Amanda soon there’s vaccine I’m getting one bout vulnerable. tl;dr: droplets carrying virus go breathing valves. satire, supposed ridiculous. Like England, European country that's worst still better top four states?  difference individual susceptibility addiction. There's one group people US uniform views. god \s general, test comes back results reported. Georgia backdates it, though, always looks like declining rate infection (because two weeks ago almost certainly cases today, backdate test results come in). Damn. wearing one since beginning double ""valves"". valves washable cloth charcoal filters. top that, mask another inner layer cloth built 6 layers different things, including charcoal. toss 5 times wearing out. well wash mask. 

So see single thing article extra protection layers used masks? really like mask design ability clean it. Sucks entire time protected :( Polls like useless. Without reasoning, results really tell anything. example, district 33% virtual 66% in-school instruction. But, half community respond. Many chose in-person called district change vote days later cases continued rise. Many people voted in-person assumed meant extreme precautions district ability provide. also confused whether in-person meant hybrid 100%. also saw correlation poverty ELL enrollment votes virtual. So, least district, mostly wealthy parents ones want go back school.

Why basing public health policy opinion polls???!!! Viruses care feelings wallet! Devos u/yourwebcam saying low quality source? sure mean. possible error wording comprehension.

The article says 8% said schools ""open usual"". ""Open usual"" could interpreted either ""open time"" ""open in-person schooling"". possible people interpreted reference ""adjustments"" responses referring either timing reopening, virtual vs. in-person reopening. found thing smoking cannabis, think nicotine unless active factor cannabis conferring benefit similar mechanism nicotine. want world actions biggest economic military power don’t affect country. chagrin many isolationist, that’s feasible anymore. cut ties quarter world economy, you’ll feel it.

Not sure about... many developments since time waste 

My point is, developments, medical advancement, especially, knowledge, context, pathogens research history led point, country proven anti-intellectuals, history development waste.

Theyre gonna lie, roll anyways, say works, change works sometimes.  Wooo get honestly surprises me. area first fast food place employees wear masks gloves generally seem shit together.

What's latest immunity? antibodies, know long provide protection? never hospital get 15-20 minutes sunshine 10-11 🤔Guess I’m going wrong hospitals SHORT TERM GAINS SHORT TERM GAINS!!!!! Danger! point valid, makes sense. cause problems here. hit 7,000,000 cases August 29 using metrics. Trump right. much winning, we're getting sick it. Atlest police federal agents plenty camo gear, tear gas, militarized vehicles incase people start protesting lack medical equipment. Tl:dr- middle pack.

I'm currently enrolled PhD program. state pays salary 30k/year. Salary, loan. pay anything back. even debt. Heck, likely bank account you! Why? live Germany US.

But agree you. Colleges universities US scam.

Also, percentages. social mobility. US lower social mobility Lithuania. broken broke ex-soviet state constant fear invaded Russia strong oligarchy. that's type country want live content that, nothing say.

Edit: case know: Social mobility measure true ""American Dream"" is. measure says, better pursuing ""American Dream"" outside US. seems president different interpretations 'the economy'. wealth influence network. interpretation matter (to him). preventable 2019, China lied people died. What's target number dead children acceptable? depends form ""positivity rate"" look at. DoH uses two different methods, one gives 12.3% latest report (shown graph), one gives 16.1%. Using ways determine rate, get different results. best look multiple sources really nail down, comes nuances exactly trying measure.

It's hard determine difference ceiling natural decrease testing *from chart alone.* However, combined plentiful reporting last couple weeks Florida reaching testing capacity nation whole experiencing shortages, natural conclusion testing hit wall. indeed experiencing fewer cases, become clear next couple weeks, there's way really conclude data have. ya fyyadd Edit: I’m positive. Yay walmart New Old Mexico I'm sure possible get surface, everything I've seen suggests risk minimal.

Still, order (and order lot) I'll take food wrappers etc. came use plates, wash hands eating. Might paranoid, extra work minimal cares?

There go. Done. That's easy present reasonable alternative embarrassing hyperbole. anything stay power

What really would helped stay power would handling epidemic competently. Many voters rightfully blame Republicans current COVID mess US. no, govern competently stay power. 7/11 real outlier, weekly average pretty much identical. I’m pissed *could* back school aren’t. 

And inconvenience? Define inconvenience? entire state online learning, businesses open. saying online instruction video. send kid daycare supposed work? you’re parent working day kids supposed online instruction, monitor that? Work full time come home lessons them? Where’s time dinner bed reasonable time? I’m lucky mom WFH, she’s still working explicitly said can’t self motivate won’t time make work. another parent didn’t would do? Come home condense day 3 hours work trying dinner housework? 

The logical thing would everything shut down. next logical thing would everyone distance wear mask. there’s LA youtubers posting videos parties, people quinceaneras, people going BBQs whining fake ada cards “right” wear mask like someone asking sacrifice firstborn child. asshats kids never get back school yes us parents pissed Well, good you. supposed go away summer heat?! Gestapo.... Japan held poster child sub elsewhere handle virus effectively. 

The truth, though difficult accept, virus cannot contained eradicated, contact tracing, testing, etc. decrease spread, delaying inevitable: come contact virus point lives. measures mentioned great idea keeping hospitals overwhelmed, maybe even holding vaccine treatment discovered, again, they're going eradicate it. soon mobility increases, cases increase.

There vaccine flu, different pathogen behaves differently. 

H1N1 relatively quick turn around vaccine US death toll less 10th current death rate middle chaos. Also, is, again, different pathogen behaves differently.

Still technically possible, unlikely.  know postponing and/or changing practices? 

A lot people wearing masks. think problem Texas cases April May many people stopped taking seriously. people brainwashed media/internet think it’s hoax, lets forget people. Oh no, mad used no-no word? always swear like sailor UCLA tracking covid cases students, faculty &amp; staff since outbreak March.

Other States Droolz really agree that. Even losing 5% weight make huge difference health. True maybe can't lose weight lose cautious. lot young obese people think underlying conditions. Obesity underlying condition. Particularly bmi 40 based photos deaths are. offense part small wedding dad nonce. Like understand saying father wanted man royals protecting him. think many unknowns able predict death peak. New cases peaked 6 days ago that's testing appears peaked. look positivity numbers, peak actually closer 14 days ago. 

There many variables state publishing. separate 200,000 health workers retested every two weeks, positivity look like general public? mixing antibody test counts pcr antigen test counts?

I hope peak today, I'm holding breath! 😶   would politicians rather sacrifice health (in cases) lives fellow humans rather letting businesses economy tank?

Answer: none rich family friends die Covid, economic crash affect investments. They’re self-serving trying prevent what’s going affect most. don’t care constituents die get otherwise harmed Covid spread. tried r/COVID19 science based sub. million reasons obesity might make worse, former obese person, simplest answer this: everyday tasks like walking stairs cause breath, virus attacks lungs going really really bad. No.

But people discuss times say someone terminal stage four cancer dies Corona counted COVID death.

Or 55 year 500 pound man heart attack cough Corona death.

Basically basis theories hospitals getting extra federal funding help fight Corona gives motivation quite liberal diagnosing Corona.

My brother doctor, says happen is, knows elsewhere. title doesn’t get clicks That's I'm looking at. There's lot fluctuation, looks like 1 week ago peak tests going down. Looking day week last vs week, looks like 10k fewer tests per day. remember really easy fall proportionality paradox, intrinsically believe big even must big cause. hard believe 140k people died President insecure listen someone smarter him, that's likely it. Trump ""borderline"" obese. close gravitational pull. release numbers day 11 summarize previous day Uh, look comment history. I've idiot since announced candidacy. Yay, got automodded mentioned similarities certain Doctor Doom, frased differently, sarcastic. Let's see one goes.  One thing worked learning play penny whistle.
 really easy learn built breath exercises. worldometers, seems outbreaks FL, TX, especially AZ slowing (in terms cases). 7 day average dipped/plateaued states. indication things getting better? due maxing testing capacity? someone could provide reputable sources explain would helpful. !remindme 1 year job important actual life death survival innocent people.

Some people innocent people going work life death situation.

This need policies place help people need quarantine, safely, ensure needs met so. That's thought, sides could paid election campaigns branded masks. Show support Biden mask! Get Trump mask here! Buy 3-pack state delegates! know area, expect many people responsive. They're ""muh freedom"" sort town. Meh, that's entirely politically motivated. Vietnam make Trump look bad. safe double (or more) figure simply tested  Essentially pronounced Geh-STAH-poe die third week

So test basically useless *cries asthmatic Kentuckian* going say says ""we"" means ""US"" right? *this jersey*

yep. 

*we know better*

nope. Damn real? obese persons oxygen requirement higher, versus diminishing supply due lung involvement, well obese persons likely obstructive sleep apnoea.  Total test number includes duplicates positive negative 15,094+78,550= 93,644 exclude positive duplicates. much lower 15,094-10,249=4,845 subtract total 93,644-4,845=88,799 divide new cases 10,249/88,799=11.5% looks like typical old man

That's pretty flattering considering we're talking can't actually make shit up. believe 11,000 people died 2014 Ebola outbreak? 

Just tell again, many Americans died thus far covid. wonder many months reach 200,000. Plenty healthy young people unfortunately died covid, even so, dumbasses act like elderly sick people arnt even real people. kids call “strong willed children”.

Yea one those. Nope responded wrote stated opposite perspective. definitely see possibility saying. definitely see perspective true well. around shitty much conflicting information there. hard trust data virus. repost Controlled? Unless government controls people, it'll never controlled. Lol, look rioting going STILL are, mad Trump sending Federal officers. 

And vicious cycle continues spin. Someone told danger teachers ""minimal"" ""shut get back work."" People really hate teachers. Whyy lmao American leaders media health experts’ worst nightmare Thank extremely intelligent, deep well thought response. given lot think choice ultimately yours. Continue associate people vote way think conspiracy. Continue associate people dont wear masks. Continue associate people break lockdown. get? Literally deserve associating people supporting enabling them.

People need take personal responsibility lives remove people going get killed. Otherwise they're useless waste important real estate hospital. feel like monster is. like people lost weight quit smoking literally anything obese illiterate racists. Let die gasping air ditch. government one buying bargaining. Pharma companies fleece individuals companies. individuals power negotiations pushed around coerced paying exorbitant prices little recourse. publicly funded heathcare program cheaper private insurance would save billions US. thought Spansh Flu still around one strains still there? making hard choices. Vietnam like one person apartment block sick, entire block gets locked one leaves homes.

Similar NZ - full lockdown waited 4 weeks (2x cycles infection) 2 weeks good measure, kept waiting new infections stopped knew certainty existing cases started from. paid everyone period obviously companies can't operate pay people forced shut down.

Worked pretty well too. people hurting government gave money meant rich friends, fed print money rich friends gave directly rich friends make slightly less money year.

So joke still stands. exactly Wuhan hospitals did. local government put cap tests severe shortage. 

Mild cases spread community. Sure, agree. still really see that's Trumps fault. get wrong, think flip-floppy statements regarding virus ridiculous, like said, still see fault NY CA widespread outbreaks. forwarded cold shit Rand Paul, doctor, said Fauci topic hearings. short sighted. ""recover"" mean winning isnt magically disappearing? potentially means next week we'll see many new cases last 2 weeks. Gonna see deaths July 4th start ramping well now. delay infection symptoms symptoms hospital deaths, followed delay processing stats, next week onwards numbers start filter through. depends age, really isn’t impossible age 13+. Schools operating exactly described country  Best way explain 8 doublings left everyone infected.

2 million active cases US roughly .5% population. Double gets 1%
Once start doubling 1% shit gets fucked quick
1/100 people sick
1/50
1/25
1/13
1/7
1/4
1/2
Our current doubling rate 1 month. stuff continues rate February march screwed. Remember 4th populous state 1000 deaths/day? three populous states getting outbreak whole country around 1000 deaths per/day. progress, idk Sugar KGB/CCP Subversion - look Yuri Bezmenov

 it, month get two three million? two weeks get three million? 😕  *if dont drown 2 minutes, drown 5?*  ""No reason"" hahahahaha &amp; gen xers. referencing sign urging Karen's &amp; Chad's shut &amp; wear masks going around Facebook. find it, link it. absolutely happened IMO. disease hoax, masks ineffective, freedom impeded...all encouraged targeted misinformation phony user accounts created nation states want see us fail. dirtbags 2 weeks ago saying hospitals can't turn away patients plenty capacity? deniers from? foreign agents? WTF??? Sounds like they’ve private schools along point go herd immunity. virus isn’t bad, reopen fully back normal, effects poorly, effects portly. Survival fittest. Whoever dies deserved die. I’m tired changing lives save weakest society. seen Logan? So, they’re illiterate. Oh require them, management enforce overnight freight team fuck us guess. Like beginning told people wear masks? They're suggesting rich countries hold debt repayments poor countries money instead used help recover economic impacts covid-19. seems like reasonable suggestion. Well nothing surprises shit anymore thanks Idiot Chief Alarmingly, 1/3 Texans say control guess? Yeah actually is... I’ve seen many lists include obesity list conditions make person particularly vulnerable COVID-19. Europe smaller people think Mercator projection. responded insults childishness. taken high road, like you. Testing capacity would started worked well Trump. would followed sort procedures saw Ebola Swine Flu included preparedness pandemics reaching US. well, would federal coordination around PPE purchasing, government forcing states bidding wars confiscating PPE shipments states.

We'd still lifetime pandemic drastic number people dying, portion death absolutely would better. would outcome. Spanish Flu virus eventually went away reached herd immunity (1.5 years) possible could happen virus, could mutate something mild common cold.

I think one likely happen vaccine. Yeah. fucking shit. Covid: Well let show Lmao. wrong yet funny. Thanks this. Really puts perspective.  sad. Prince George’s hit hardest MD. zipper covers snap bottom strollers cant. Weve using one years 3 year old 5 year old flu season rains. 10k, 10k, 10k... think Florida may hit testing limit. Whatever fit narrative. way covid denier/hoaxer objectivity critical thinking gets thrown window replaced panic, never get this. 

You right fact every time someone gets tested, case making sure wasn’t false positive, gets counted another confirmed case. stupid, unfunny, childish comment. reporting you. Good day sir. Yeah, worked paper past I've known well. Part reason switched broadcast journalism haha makes think Trumps handling virus based Putin’s instructions? Well wrong. someone get tested die appear covid19 death. die home. like going waste test dead body. trump's defense, say would ""magically disappear"" April. course, say April, can't ever accused lying *that* one ;) heard need thin.. Hello, welcome reddit. must new here. Yes sounds like sweet old lady. Dude relax. fine 😂

I mean, honestly, anyone believe anything government says anymore? thing aggressively angry something people blast constant diarrhea. They're see option.

We talking life death here, intestinal distress. going keep downplaying results this, conversation pointless think anger addressed politicians whose job solve systemic issues.

Plenty anger everyone deserves it. single politician federal office right deserves reelected brought realize homelessness people live society, right? They're cast Quarantine proposing plan ultimately make people can't socially distance. Homeless people chilling home watching Netflix like want COVID positive cases want COVID people street viable option policies make safe so.

Yes, agree. saying feds need step beginning. 

That change fact unacceptable people going work sick infect people deadly still evicting people illegally takes money renters stop evictions.

THat entirely separate issue absolutely needs ddressed. 

The solution absolutely people sick deadly virus go work control entitlement. I'm making case people entitled infect others. I'm saying forcing people unsafe situations.

You saying people allowed go work sick deadly virus spreading control treatments. beginning think death fetish get off. explanation thinking people allowed work sick deadly virus. I'm guessing arguing climate encourages people indoors spring/summer, public indoor spaces great avoiding COVID-19. lived Florida upon time, that's crazy thing say.

Whether impact debated. better question is, known people would indoors more, encourage people congregate restaurants bars? Policy still matters more. Canada exposed virus much earlier Texas.

A month ago, Texas half cumulative deaths, around 2200. gone 2200 since then. period, Canada's cumulative deaths increased 400. Wow, awesome. Thanks!  doesn't, came basically looking victimized.

You're type lockdown measures mitigate hoax right? F Yeah cause Northeasterns spread virus fleeing Florida went vacation south real smart. It’s great watching people northeast, from, spread virus across country, people die region, try shame everyone lol. Dr. Fauci get hazmat suit! Oh yeah comments pissed off. Yikes. That’s rough. I’m sorry she’s putting risk. Sending healthy vibes way Oh :( Well direct job bill Medicare person works upper management major hospital knows talking YES hospitals get paid patients die COVID-19. means hospitals listing COVID-19 cause death isn't. trust see news, trust government accept reality. choice. mine would actually try convince bite isn’t bad!! dont think thats fair places like brazil india africa Focusing laughing China help lowering infection rate. use Chinese vaccine, microchips it. can't thing China successfully quarantine virus that's communist. That's current administration's mentality. Maybe wore masks **and** approach grandpa less 1 meter. ""humans"", Americans. Every country Earth took least *some* precautions, literally claimed nothing happening. deserve everything get now. It' shameful opinion. occupational therapist way would put kids life quality life risk. see real life stories simply able room hospital butt puckers. Sometimes wonder even care kids all. thing rates still going up, hard tell accurate moment. never happen staff isn’t paid enough take abuse. It’s thing China Africa. allies Russia North Korea. Man, 3.5 years took. Good job supporters man currently occupying WH. total number ultimately matters, Sweden's quite fine compared to, say, Germany France. already started holding debt payments irony entire political group relentlessly espouses ""personal responsibility"" utterly failing absolute bare minimum save lives preventable infection pretty astounding. Well countries emerging (this happen) may friends future. Trump therefore us (anymore) reliable partner. Hes trying hold power status end hes speeding process (due behaviour) since makes friends turn away. sovereign country. saying dont see bigger country affecting smaller one former times partnership. us people us economy evolves threats people changing doesnt fit view anymore.
Not see amount persons rises. feel like agreement. Ur fuxking idiot Evaluating intelligence might simple mask one’s face...  well thing cases still going up, given 4-6 week lag deaths, would next month assuming cases next week start going down. L.A. San Diego districts right thing. Covid19 control, state shutdown. 

The vast majority teachers unions weak, whether right-to-work state not. Obama green lit machine would make n95 masks pandemic. Trump nix it. Lol today's new numbers, it'll already like 4.2 million Pregnant women higher risk. love defend poor bad politician man something harm time let's look shop, food deserts thing. Lmaoooo New Yorker saying Jersey driving accents horrible? Pot, meet kettle. wear masks stay home unlike right can’t seem make even slightest accommodations society I'm sorry loser demand time money strangers raise children. nothing substance claims, big surprise. Sounds like cousin moved October. living best life said life want stay home.  Wow limp.  

*plonk* Sorry internet friend, lockdowns work evidence beforehand would work know work. work. Did. Not. Work. still believe said would work. Got. It. place planet prepared significant percentage population get sick COVID. That’s advised take significant preventative measures like mask wearing. Backwards republicans fighting wearing masks iNfRiNgEs fReEduMbs!

Yeah live Idaho place also rife mentality. rehab, really d00mer. Next stop, 1 3 million dead US warned start this. deaths bad April? Adenovirus vaccine inactivated vaccine potential problems.

For Adenovirus one insane reason used human Adenovirus instead chimpanzee one, issue ton people immune human Adenovirus reduces efficacy.

The inactivated one might okay issue inactivated vaccines generally lot weaker vaccines require multiple doses build immunity, bad need vaccinate billion people quickly. Funny people vaped specific additive died early covid, huh. hey show pic exists. telling pic worth literally 0 days. Maybe problem depended *centralized* systems institutions

We know *decentralized, self-organizing* systems far robust.

But opinion you’d expect anarcocapitalist lost braincells reading comment. 

Every statement true well demonstrated. OP misrepresenting statistics recently, started include positivity rates reported DOH using correct formula. New Zealand right things zero Covid cases back normal. mean lost three million votes Im sure North Korea also claims low corruption. ""This fault""  **""It's someone else's fault. mine. take responsibility.""** 

Ron DeathSantis best Donald Trump impression. People online also sensitive snowflakes can’t handle downvote without whining. 🤷‍♀️ Maybe. Less let impact vote. people keep talking Texas like apocalypse, think really interesting actually still far better shape Canada.

Sure, likely change point future. comparing situation past, today, Texas far fewer deaths proportionately Canada.

I picking Canada population approximately comparable, place people dont think ""having hit hard"". Well, whatever worth, Canada. done ok, retrospect could done better. know people like hear this, mandatory masks public buildings works, really does. like here, depending city, cities masks public buildings. Masks solve problem entirely, help. wear now. helps Oh god that's terrifying. idea why? Even sociopath cared profits, would still want employees healthy could productive. end work home surge? stupid. I'm used greed, moronic gotten fast food (I tend get fast food even pre-pandemic) I've ordered takeout bunch times. 

I pretty much figured someone still working restaurant, need to. need much they're even safe. So, since need *that* badly, may well contribute getting good amount money they're it. I've giving high tips. 

So think takeout giving decent tips ethical option. also purchase gift cards, help give little breathing room financially things less insane. One local restaurant big push gift cards months ago gave half gift card money straight staff. testing really increased much either, lower lot days, except positive rates higher cases. Imagine ramped testing match positivity rate growth? would really start know exponential spread. That's incredible progress!!! got this! Oh, don’t know.... Maybe millions people gotten virus well hundred thousand died sign virus subsiding???? Use brain please. Well, can't use death rate falling argument anymore, fall back old reliable: ""THE NUMBERS LIES!"" They're going sandy Hook Model 

It worked gun deaths agree, countries done quite well people learn deal little discomfort work towards common goal. America way individualistic literally killing people :( couple fitness trainers too, 30s, guess ancient avg redditor like 5 seen anecdotal accounts reports indicate someone herd immunity still might contagious carrier even there's reinfection.

I hope that's true. Wish observational studies actual mask wearing. Anecdotal evidence reliable. also polling might testing virtue signaling actual behavior. try getting kid age 9 keep one on. stupid. Yeah, far tell, ""brandishing"" (or equiv) typically kinda vague order allow judgement call DA. one ""you know see it"" things. strange fast food sandwhich “already paid for” (which, find, really guarantees freshness) didn’t live expectations Hopefully Jesus saves medical insurance Right? said thing boyfriend. I’m hard time respecting friends due way they’re choosing handle virus. would definitely hide zombie bite us hang little bit longer. interesting question.

maybe could either scheduled times students without computer come school bit, learn go back home. could special internet plans people really cannot afford internet. bet would strong opinions vailidity God's pulled gun them. lol dad told legend:

According legend, God Krishna appeared form sage court king ruled region challenged game chess (or chaturanga). king chess enthusiast gladly accepted invitation. prize decided game king asked sage choose prize case won. sage told king modest claim man material needs, wished grains rice. amount rice shall determined using chess-board following manner. One grain rice shall placed first square, two grains second square, four third square, eight fourth square, sixteen 5th square on. Every square double predecessor.

The king lost game sage demanded agreed-upon prize. started adding grains rice chess board, king soon realised true nature sage's demands. royal granary soon ran grains rice. king realised never able fulfill promised reward number grains increasing geometric progression total amount rice required 64-squared chess board 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 translating trillions tons rice.

Upon seeing dilemma, sage appeared king true-form, Lord Krishna told king pay debt immediately could pay time. king would serve paal-payasam (pudding made rice) temple freely pilgrims every day debt paid disagree attack argument try prove wrong, resort personal attacks proves idea talking about.  frustratingly easy hit amount. pocket max £6k, that's cost us straightforward birth (and birth alone, since early year--we paid plenty prenatal care new year) healthy baby. 

Next kid born country universal healthcare... everyone! 4 million....smh it’s we’re testing more. /s certainly morbid side, weight numbers outright lies. 6'2"" (his reported height) little heavier average 230 lbs. (his reported weight) dont look nearly large does. I'd put least another 50 lbs. get close looking like that. lived America around 7 years truly American phenomenon. put ‘you anything want be’ drummed guys young age. can’t, always better, don’t aptitude something chances won’t flourish. denser people really take theory literally think challenge anything. 
Something think social media given rise opinion fact. Yes, opinions, can’t facts. Blame socialist Texan healthcare.

Edit: see people thought meant literally, satire. Conservative Americans blamed tragedies Italy Spain ""socialism"". Ah darn, took wedding page means, explain math work. folks wearing masks. Hopefully stayed far enough apart.

The galling part seniors way. could gone *before* water park, chose swing after. there? Yeah, actually. Exactly. hospital filled virus, mask works. waiting table Denny's? mask makes look like asshole, throw away sit moons myhammy! know that's downvoted Based wrote, statement Masks reduce oxygen levels 

is wrong. Masks certainly reduce oxygen levels certain conditions. correct? pride month, anniversary pulse nightclub shooting, less.

This fucker flew LGBT flag upside knows exactly he's test two days ago. sure around teammates. I’m kinda surprised game played. optimist. like you. Let's hope. can’t prevent origin. prevent / contain spread. Ebola isn’t pandemic contained. (Fingers crossed) Yeah, 6 month lockdown inevitably cause civil unrest.  Hahahaha next July then!! Enjoy nap :) Knock knock  Exactly this. authority make schools open across country, threatening withhold funds schools fully open. One would think. knows anymore. Sometimes think we’re upside down. Hidalgo county reported 49 deaths yesterday. Significantly Houston Dallas, fear might worst affected region TX Wrong country lol 😂 5 weeks shut fast food nothing. Free Internet stop bills ext. ext. 2 viral cycles 2.5k$ 5 weeks rations given national guard. done conflicted get behind this. schools Texas providing tablets. local internet companies offering free internet kids use back March. would assume now. “Wow really got fooled. Aren’t aware coronavirus FAKE NEWS RADICAL LEFT!? Maybe educate go online embarrassing yourself!”

People really talk like see nothing wrong they’re saying. never happen, long there's single Republican office. said, I'm sure Democrats would manage pass healthcare law cost three billion dollars per patient covered athlete's foot euthanasia, I'm sure that's bad thing. mention logical fallacy. 

Aside people exposed front lines, mask make difference. Therefore masks make difference frontlines.

Why maks make difference elsewhere? magic threshold exposure masks suddenly start making difference? know, even Hitler implemented food policies animal welfare.

Edit : good* Ha funny. Got jokes? It’s boogaloo boy. He’s prepping show force hospital AR rest meal team six. trust economists teach economics? saw Canada (Ontario) was........yes, people quite considerate, mask mandate, lot people wearing masks, everyone quite considerate polite. (Well, to.........this Canada, that's job, eh?........lol, kidding)......but anyway, mask mandate started couple weeks ago, almost push back. And, go grocery store, let without mask. Period. happy give mask one, I'll bet would go get groceries you, appeared reason wear mask all. Lots cooperation compliance really Long time ago :) It’s shame take months another trial used. many people could saved. numbers lies. probably worse people dying home getting tested. don’t know share works? infected person handled food, covid particles would transferred? Newsom opened state transmission rate still (or close to) one. would argue idea doing. comes money China playing game US mastered throwing money nations. isolationist nationalist policies world connected like never going seriously hinder future generations. There’s middle ground current polarization US, people keep staking extreme positions effort considered conservative liberal. Florida's seven day rolling average new daily cases decreased 5 past 6 days. 

You see [Washington Post's Florida 4% decrease new cases past week. idiot needs resign. Rona DeathSantis liar. There's nothing better ignorant asshole spewing unfounded nonsense fact. cuntiness charts sad come this. wish people took seriously. way. travel living airplane times pandemic. flights I've taken (all Delta), looking around 97% mask compliance, one middle seat occupied. 

I think would difficult set rule start flight ""if must drink eat flight must place mask back bites sips"".  Multiple airlines already banning passengers refusal wear masks, threat return flight cancelled, banned specific airline go long way. 


I know sounds like lot extra work really isn't. Flight attendants regular walkthroughs plane, *very* easy spot someone without mask standing aisle. 

People flying automatically assumed part problem. *a lot* reasons flying beyond ""vacation"" time. example initial border closings correct estimation ripped them

I, many others, ripping aggressive enough those. waited long reason closed things China virus raging across Europe parts Asia. made damn sense allowing travel allowed spread faster first.

You right, though, early on, almost everyone made mistakes. due lack info, malicious. pretty easy tell based that. Ones needed better info changed operated quickly getting info. Ones malicious lashed new information, doubling mistakes.

And almost across board, corrected mistakes Democrats doubled mistakes Republicans.

I wish case, that's point. So, tried read understand wondered evidence support children 10 spread virus less. saying. conclusion children age 10 transmit virus less, children 10 may socialized more. least that's read it.

""We also found highest COVID-19 rate (18.6% \[95% CI 14.0%–24.0%\]) household contacts school-aged children lowest (5.3% \[95% CI 1.3%–13.7%\]) household contacts children 0–9 years middle school closure. Despite closure schools, children might interacted other, although data support hypothesis.""

So, know ... informative ... Oxford pls  ask order countries. order nobody know mass produced like nothing ever Wake 10, young blood. need people unite fix problem.

""#maskormace""

""Mask Mace"" 

If see someone without mask, pepper spray face sight. definitely found Donald’s burner account They're responding continue current rate 1000 per day, we'll hit 775000+140000=915,000 end year.

Which objectively wrong  Woah what’s meant exponential growth rate...no way...mind blown 🙄 lick hands spit other's mouth? doesnt help [DeSantis' trimmed 17,000 cases according [site maintained old data analyst fired.  Nice. spouse stay home supervise/care him? acts like filter creates larger pressure drop mouth lungs. quality air going lungs change, diaphragm needs work slightly harder pull air around mask. 

You're assuming mask changing air quality going lungs, dropping oxygen levels making tired faster. case. 

The mask making diaphragm work harder pull air lungs. tired lack oxygen, tired diaphragm working harder usual. oxygen levels likely unchanged unless exercising vigorously normally cause drop blood oxygen.

At rest walking around, diaphragm absolutely issues pulling adequate breaths mask, blood oxygen stay optimum levels. ** WEAR ** ** MASK ** Actually want kids even learning real science contradicts whatever alternate reality want believe in. spell like Democrat! ^s still backlog active cases. Unfortunately deaths won’t go single digits 0 longer. 

But watching Active Cases number continue plummet beautiful thing. kid standing beyond order window taking payments reaching window. They've done forever location. No, deaths unacceptable. disagree kids can’t it. can. I’m longer classroom taught elementary school years. Yes, requires absolute adherence requires enforced district level masking social distancing keep students teachers safe, strictly enforced. many countries communities successfully educating kids still keeping new infection rate almost zero. Kids absolutely that’s cost going back school, parents get line. wouldn’t teach lot plans everyone follows recommendations know work, possible. members community aren’t willing make changes, you’re right, isn’t safe. safe possible, normal coming back anytime soon. fact true honestly makes unbelievably sad. think people also vastly underestimate many times school-based adults tell kids get things mouths remove mouths things. ""Please lick friend/desk/shoe"" common enough say tone ""please use Kleenex."" True. almost week old test results. 

Last week's problem officially today; next week today tested.
Possibly longer officially reported counties.  Maybe encourage Americans get health together? bunch capitalist countries dealt virus well. can't it.   fucking insane. Hospitals full thousand miles people dying, yet there’s still shelter place order??? desperate fucking emergency like country never seen, state governments willingly admitting don’t give shit point. There’s absolutely justification this, government sacrificing it’s citizens money....

Not mention, ONE going accept taking loved ones home watching die, suffocating mucus. People going start crowding hospitals states. Icu nurses held gunpoint admission. could get fucking ugly. task failed successfully? people make bad life decisions. brother great job, massive house, nice things never worry money. pregnant wife still think kids need back school wants put 2yr old daughter daycare come September wife go back work months love money. life 16+ nothing good can't fathom anything bad happening them. state people cant in? Wow can't believe even wasted time reading bullshit. idiots???

My favorite piece bullshit CH: “We swine flu: around 0.1-0.3% much lower think moment seeing case fatality”.

About Swine FLu?? Well lets see Swine Flu infected 60 million Americans killed 12,000 them. find people much pay come dribble? Well think past days next couple weeks speak themselves. New York tried warn rest us. yeah August yet. Go Vols, I've wearing mask distancing college football. tried turning again? Ah yes suppression information intended manipulate behavior, inform. become par course virus.

At first, suppressed info supports conclusion masks help curb spread, governor’s words “we didn’t want thinking replacement social distancing” suppress info isn’t great quality evidence work quite well general public settings, order manipulate people wearing them.

What victim here? thing need right now: trust experts, politicians, authorities.

How get unfiltered truth make informed decisions. US concentration camps too. use euphemism detention centers. I’m sure there’s fudging China wouldn’t believe order magnitude fudging. anyone really surprised point? able anything else right, would expect test properly? RW Americans turned stark raving lunatics. going end well. bunch obese morons could possibly go wrong?  Yeah, right. Arizona's tests per week actually decreased slightly last week two still 24% positivity--their plateau completely artificial. Florida's tests per week also slightly decreased week.

Hitting test capacity hardest-hit US states number countries worldwide pretty bad. India's cases going straight roof. Cases India doubled last three weeks -- could looking 80K/day mid-August, unless reach test capacity, too. account like 9 years old seen caverns weapons. Owned people deranged could whole studies yes believe combined terrain guerilla tactics would interesting. asked Russians easy stop Kurds. we're talking total number dead country. obviously need adjust inflation. would incredibly silly otherwise obviously larger countries would worse. Every individual option wearing mask, mandate no. weren’t ever tested Covid, chances allocated Covid death seems remarkably low. Covid death typically translates Covid case... 

Furthermore, you’re alluding excess deaths many people weren’t counted cases died never caught Covid. You’re wrong, think you’re reverse analyzing wrong way youre choosing plane sitting shoulder shoulder people allowed take masks off. isnt using mask, using mask. youre allowed use mask plane x amount time, entire point. literally everyone plane take masks time. packed like sardines tin breathing air. 2 weeks Arizona similar one lily pads lake. 

If lily pads lake double surface area every day lake completely full day 30, half full? trips lot people day 29 half full.  US begin heavily suppress reporting deaths couple weeks Elon doesn’t know foreplay is. you’re moving goal posts...

u/supersonicme linked reference, need wrong? Cause everyone dead then? Right. That's covid insidious. long ass onset feel fine picking things public dirty hands putting back store shelves, touching door handles, gas pumps, shedding feel fine, bananas. big coofs chest hurties within like 24 hours even 48 would much easier deal with, parties protests full energetic folks sickness clock So? It’s pretty common different illnesses symptoms. Best luck family! 11 year old passed “several underlying health conditions” according Orlando Sentinel. I’m sure others. also magical cure COVID-19. Well, something aware of… though niche, though! Swedish translate part you: [An immunity completely stops infection never happen. immunity keep spread infection down, let go restrictions. infection go away. type herd immunity infection suppressed achieved combined went also described idea herd immunity without vaccine myth later interview.

Edit: I've read articles linked now. None talking full herd immunity. reporter first article mentions herd immunity occurs around 60% immunity, that's number Tegnell talking about. might connected [this Tegnell talks model shows Stockholm could reach partial herd immunity within weeks (at time).

When FHM talks possible herd immunity never really talk full herd immunity hits around 60-70%. see off/on switch suddenly go population immunity full herd immunity. Instead see immunity population (40-45% according last article linked) give protection population. still ongoing spread full herd immunity achieved (which needs vaccine). Abbott better him, Kemp, Stott.  course, like deciding whether would rather shot, stabbed, poisoned getting Ebola.  students told go school pandemic, real lesson they're taught ignore science learning process general polar opposite education's purpose first place. Added stack. 

Thanks bunch

-Ron agree too. 

It’s important strive perfection, it’s also important maintain realistic perspective end becoming disillusioned world incapable absolute perfection. 

Some might argue bigger sin would promising, yet underdelivering. 

It’s balancing act sure. realize Texas firefighters fill cause death forms filed CDC. news Governor requesting people got test results without test speak provide information investigated. individual come forward provided information documentation. feel like I’m track trying pick losing horse. We’ll see. Well probably end paying $20 pop wouldnt sick fucks outside northeast better stay tf away

There’s reason new order, first offense result $400 fine, second $1,000 fine $2,000 third offense. live Arkansas. people care. Even though state requires masks now, exemptions crazy. wear one church example Thank ton. means lot. 10/10 would send avocados feel like studies like feeding confirmation bias pro-mask wearers' derogatory views non-mask wearers. understand wear masks, believe majority narcissists, psychopaths, low IQ, etc. know reach people convince wear mask, calling idiots psychopaths going convince them.

I think large part people wear masks follow public health guidelines purely fear. cognitive dissonance would overwhelming follow public health guidelines simultaneously hold **non-scary** belief virus dangerous. lot people elide scary things pretending exist believe strong motivator behind non-maskers. I'm economist data driven decision making, thing keep telling many people's actions far motivated emotions facts/data. Obviously ideally protests given nature government saying protest going work. There's way stop protests tried best method would either placate leave them.

Plus...I'm pretty sure people *still* getting hooked onto tobacco &amp; endangering &amp; others' lives, health, etc. despite US, etc. ordering regulations tobacco industry. 

Face it, *real* cures people suffer en masse overconsumption junk food/tobacco/etc. 1) change society's mindsets what's desirable diet, level alarmed someone's/your body size/weight gain, always needing go, hatred cooking, prioritizing ""treating yourself"" &amp; rapid self-gratification putting even tiny bit effort ensuring things better &amp; future-basically, passing marshmallow test cultural/societal level, etc., &amp; 2) reducing socioeconomic, societal, cultural, etc. strains many working/poor people push marshmallow test-failing lifestyle routines like using tobacco, getting fast food lunch/dinner days, eating Ho-Hos breakfast, mostly drinking sugary soda/energy drinks instead water no/low-calorie drinks, eating HUGE portions everything, etc. Life US I'd say residents stressful enough push people habitually consuming junk/too much food general, &amp; whole ""eff beauty standards, fat *beautiful!*"" feelgood toxic-positivity bullshit starting 2010s egging people away seriously caring physical health even more. Herd immunity needs, least, 80% people infected. 350m people, means 280m infections. Assuming conservative 0.5% fatality rate, that's 1.4m deaths. 

That's twice many Americans died 1918 flu pandemic (about 675k deaths).

No big deal. double fatality numbers worst pandemic US ever dealt before. Oh, pandemic hit we'd even invented *antibiotics* yet. Two weeks enough. Israel virtually shut way longer two weeks soon opened saw uptick cases. Well, get face China’s ass, take look around, resign. think North America (because include Canada well) kind lost place world. We’re actually quite isolated. Latin America least rest Latin America, pretend don’t. 

WWII probably big split. god damn easy it’s wrecked us. It’s made us bad. We’re aggressive kind we’re soft tough. Thats meant Abaco. wasnt ""Abaconian"" (or Bahamian really) Abaco added tracker yet... least thats assumption. Islands get added tracker occur. Mexican (and something people took issue bringing Mexican workers, hotspot, PANDEMIC) must count island even though ""told"" two people Abaco. Clear mud?

Eaither way, figure we're headed lockdown again. weekend, next. Mask glasses

4. virus blown proportion media Governments. (he specifically game example Tuberculosis killed 1M people last year, give much attention)

There's way zealousness pro-life argument politicians anything vote calculations, definitely use deliberate wedges. argument 1000 lower 2500. I’m sure lose argument.

Your argument ""perspective"", apparently lack. 1,000 people dying virus somehow justified ""a ago, 2,500 people day"". Even recently hundred people day. US trending wrong direction, that's unfortunate perspective. remember Florida's hospitalizations deaths relatively constant?

**7 day rolling average spoke 38, yesterday 118. 310.5% increase rolling 7 day average 3 weeks.** things continue get worse next month two. Maybe improve, maybe people wear masks distance. know.

So next time headache drill hole temple..or think humours unaligned ask doctor good old fashioned blood-letting. Only, counting deaths home Covid deaths, last checked. man - logic it’s okay say minorities lazy statistically tend lower socioeconomic bracket. That’s blanket statement it’s true.

Not really logic. statistics look even correct systemic externalities (socioeconomic status, household compositions) actually get apples apples comparison. fails recognize reasonable nuance situation. problem isn’t black white. It’s shades grey.

While sort ‘’’nuance’’’ world burns. problem people excessively focused detail—I don’t disagree topics nuance, true black white abstract issue presented wouldn’t recognize it. 

Am holding every American personally responsible this? No. *did* contribute problem every time prioritized “civility” truth justice. weren’t vigilant prioritized

Simply put, way notion collective victory without accepting notion collective failure. 

We allowed one two political parties meaningfully exist country politicize notions basic reality. I’m sorry break you, that’s massive fucking failure us amount shit gets entirely fault. They've said lot stupid shit crisis. technique used trolls others derail real conversation. Downvote, report forum polices it, ignore. live 5th floor facing broadway. Sure could hear sirens last year...but spring despite roads empty compared normal, ambulance siren rate insane around clock. Oh we’re well one Brazilian dead people thread saying covid easy win administration paying attention last four years sheer incompetence? stable geniuses going trot years, you? NC, moved school start dates weeks earlier. months ago.

And reason certain COVID-19 would almost gone mid-late summer (due summer heat obviously!), would better session warmer times winter, might come back.

Before berate unbelievably stupid (they are) believing virus would magically recede summer despite evidence contrary, consider likely right main point - *will* worse November/December now. Classy Fuck 'em Maybe looking wrong metrics. What‘s common denominator Trump, Bolsonaro Modi? There‘s definitely pattern good rapid tests countries.

We cuz greed. greed, greed. fact think painful realize wrong really tells everything need know discuss good faith not. interested engaging people invest emotional stake right finding truth. I’m American interest politics downvote brigade jump reply, lot answer for, alleged China collusion either, also lies endorsing bad studies released regarding effectiveness masks, lies virus transmissible effectiveness drug hydroxychloroquine used early treatment. That’s tip iceberg too. one job do, failed spectacular fashion. many people state jam pack Florida every year summer.  It’s place nice weather, nice beaches smoking hot girls.  Cali, one New York going crash Cali Florida cheap plane ticket, car ride bus trip away. Yep, Ontario’s cases rising again. Ford opened soon. I'd politely disagree. Germany Ireland, initially ask wear mask stop competition demand healthcare system. He'll proven right eventually. It'll gone future Easter. I’m taking anything personally, get from? I’m responding defending Delta airlines I’m sick people sticking corporations. logic airlines shitty things sometimes, disregard personal experience flown hundreds times. make sense? I’ve flown “shitty” airlines like Spirit Frontier many times well never close bad experience delay occurred. guess you’ve “called it” won’t responding though country least 1M population, Belgium ranks highest deaths per million. I'm guessing pretty sure that? maybe miss point. hard say honestly. Obviously Trump enough really hurt situation. take measures like China people would hate well. 36 hours Nashville. Thank you, Vanderbilt. ""And news, people wear face masks social-distance properly likely spread Coronavirus...""

(Virtual facepalm) Mike Pompeo another sycophantic administration sock puppet. Anyone contrarian thought weeded out. One prominent company (the 45 minute test) actually switching combo flu a/b, strep, covid, rsv tests save plastic cartridges. gotta honest, really understand people care ""positivity rate"" metric. offers good information states limited testing capabilities take 7+ days present test results. fact Trump called Fauci alarmist need know Trump's intentions here.

He's sweeping every problem he's encountered throughout entire life rug, he's met existential crisis/pandemic can't throw money lawyers it. instead, mindlessly tries sweep rug calling lead experts lifetime experience dealing epi/pandemics alarmist attitudes. pandemic expert tells need worry, fucking listen.

What failed real estate businessman know pandemics. Absolutely nothing (as he's clearly shown briefings infatuation pseudoscience rhetoric miracle drugs clorox injections).

Trump zero experience call Fauci alarmist. Trump saying Fauci presumes Trump sort expertise subject (in order call experts).

This literally like Trump trying give batting practice tips fucking Ken Griffey Jr. ""You know Jr, could get alittle power twirl bat head like that."" Like stfu dude. zero expertise yet calling actual experts ""experty.""

A pandemic expert says trouble. listen. deflect, ignore, smear expert alarmist. 140K deaths record unemployment....but Fauci alarmist, guys...nothing see here. admit making stuff up? 

That easy. feel like real numbers got lot higher, know? deaths per capita one highest world. Pretending like success shows extremely callous disregard human life. D: I'm sorry food industry created portion sizes. Ooof. John Cambell agreed Pompeo video yesterday said needs new director. see giant discrepancies site open, worldometers included

Idk believe Like people going listen federal response. People won’t listen people don’t like. Look country how’s 2020 going far. Even city state levels mask mandatory still see 50% people wearing mask. I’m California numbers high there. People seem care rules laws anymore. \*stares roast beef sandwhich\* call find hubris person school fall comical  Sweden, come. keep ICUs well overflowing letting elderly die home. Sure, many could survived would die, flip side no-one could ever claim service overrun, makes look good.  wonder okay put additional cloth mask top n95 valve. would give level protection (for others) regular cloth mask? Again, that’s total representative situation today. data you’re quoting describes situation back like April what’s happening today. 

Obviously it’s time celebrate go shore. think reacting 15 years ago Sinopharm first enter phase 3 trial. surprised develop vaccine first. He's right, know. seasonal, means Floridians seasoned virus. keep touch one nurse moved family Dallas that's father, practicing physician is, single parent.

He young child three young girls sent camp. currently there. camp.

Neither doctor nurse heartburn it.

It's really weird see behavior medical staff happens lot. pandemic preventable January

Except even Fauci said February wear Cuomo shouldn’t send people covid nursing homes I'm skeptical ability pull off. many people complicit. Certainly mayor Phoenix complicit 2/3 cases wheelhouse. 

We know Florida's governor DeSantis it, got whistle blown him. [He's apparently 17,000 cases 114 deaths whistleblower old data analyst provides us [her without data ""adjustments"" DeSantis demanded. 

Edit: I'm sorry, thought CoronavirusAZ thread. fully expect South Africa's ruling class could pull level corruption, question. Take guess political discussion removed

The morons wrong side history dumb realize stupid are? 🤷‍♀️ Yes should. whole idea healthy family one dad mom failing itself. mind ask progression covid like? normal flu-like symptoms (not comparing flu, saying like sore throat/coughing/headache/fever/etc)? bad start got better getting worse? less symptomatic start progressively gotten worse? Shit, put sugar coffee, beer two evening still hit 100g protein 1800 cal. Sometimes even eat icecream. still get greens, whole grains, root veg in.

Reddit collective annurism sugar mentioned, simple fact *no bad foods*. bad portions combinations. come family makes everything scratch. There’s minimal sugar anything. Lots lean meat, whole grain, veggies Parents borderline obese. fair, mom cook professional quality. It’s hard overeat I’m there... sister figured young adults healthy weight activite.

The problem lack health education knowledge want icecream swap sandwich lunch salad vinegar. It’s knowing balance foods “a lot X little Y” still hit macros get variety nutrients.

But that’s really hard “sugar BAD” really easy assuming get 1,000 deaths day rest year. hospitals Texas Florida running space virus exponentially spreading really believe number going increase? Sweden low corruption covid deaths match excess deaths.

Your assumptions based nothing substantial. Sorry, talking rational, educated people doing.  understand there's still holdouts believe ""let run course"" great thing do, course horribly wrong reasons stated.  said ""The goal obviously be...."" [Pareto Yeah, that's people work. Climate change. litterally make rich richer order get anything done. Swedens future ruined awfully reacted though. international reputation destroyed devestating small country. people hate Sweden cause lther country world outside shitties part US arrogant. would know? People lie lives line. like opinion, man! well Canada's government elected base knowledge, usa government elected popularity like high school homecoming Yes know. Thats point. parents want open, one reason another. Maybe work. Maybe want take care kids. Maybe capable teaching kids...whatever...the parents want schools open that's they're opening. gvt admin want open  There’s way get around thought elitist spill facts. It’s way America. reason case count looked low extreme lack testing. always poorly, worse worse. That’s fine. tried appeal people’s good desire protect fellow countrymen.

But clearly doesn’t exist fines jail time! Fuck you, America! 7 day average going down.....how so?  Last two weeks broken records, thing keeping week massive, running test supplies current backlog. Im ok answers less talking properly listening.

There's studies disparity women men medicine..

Women complain four times men size recovering surgeries.

That's ok. bigger deal made people wearing masks chins too. That's good one. saw somebody call Sweet Potato Hitler spit water. anything make look good point? tanner, hair... actions lack thereof... Complicated? way, shape, form. see why. Oh well... sorry. Missed point entirely Stop engaging discussion. bad faith argument, nothing change mind unfortunately. Literally. half since that's measure those. ""You free make bad choices, therefore cannot blame us!""
/s son school online since kindergarten. real teacher. It’s almost Trump administration incompetent run bumbling idiots. /s Logical consistency seem crowd's strong suit like feel like we're complete idiots revolting masks? 

Amongst things. Confirmation bias fact human psychology. ever increasingly critical average person understands this, learns techniques help identify ourselves, becomes socially acceptable point someone else it.

Should something apologize thank person kindly brought attention. principle leaving fly open leaving nose mask. future people design computers print 3d bioprinters. that’s shit really begins. Natural evolution lame comparison. fauci trump administration Ah ye olde deeraoo Yes, know, covid democratic ruse take away guns. except fact COVID-19 control Canada, Texas currently transporting patients plane helicopters enough range get ICU beds available.

I guess agree disagree, would much rather spending rest pandemic Canada Texas. 

Now fun quoting stats really mean anything whomever else amuse. even take refuge stats, common GOP trick, course prevent dying, someone love, fun say Canada worse job Texas, fun, fun, fun...

PS: wear mask, even Trump begrudgingly admits kind patriotic now... Boko Haram. motherfuckers stopped eradication polio, killing polio vaccinators creating terror.. Haha! Okay, point, still brutal watch what's happening poor people steerage say matter Somewhere internet there’s video girl pretending take drivers permit test. she’s actually pro gymkhana driver scares sheets instructor. instructor Fauci. instructor us. 

Edit: found it. That's NY alongside NJ - due much travel going NY, fluctuating number new cases per day that's pretty consistently around 1% tests.

Upstate NY mini outbreak overall trends lower NY pretty much late may, **despite** open point vs major shutdown then.

All takes beat Covid manageable level behave wear masks public - that's much rest America, seems. one romanian senators got caught without mask enclosed space fined , dismissively paid making clear pocket change declared never wear mask respects trusts trump trump told to

it fuckin contagious agreed. one made new rule defending countries state supported slavery. includes US. really sucks rule encompasses US, unfortunately absolutely astounding number people prisons consistently violate people's rights. Never defended China, named lot things US guilt too. know think okay literally worst country entire world, US still guilty. something particularly different Canadian podcasts? math works. Misleading title. 1/10 huge number people want send kids die/ walking pestilence bearers.  lot truth article whole thing written I-Told-YouSo look-at-my-book format  fact Swedens batshit insane experiment could keep going little opposition anywhere, outside angry statements already way late, shows things probably doesnt work well Sweden. poor families computer internet? No, people testing positive, 12% age range. break different age groups. relatives do.

Although funny enough, ones think proof End Times also vocal ""hoax"". think choose one other, Bible say ""and plagues, they'll fake lol worry"".

And there's one guy takes Covid seriously think purely really looking proof End Times anyway. He's kinda gone deep end. point video make statement? outdoor concerts, festivals, sporting events still cancelled doesn’t spread type gathering? attribute malice easily explained ignorance early stages many couldn’t get tested. 

Looking stats, 0.003% confirmed positive, less 0.01% antibodies, points 2 missed cases every one confirmed case. bad IMO considering took ramp testing. white people photographed races underrepresented... good points honest teaching oneself drive really hard Amazing party personal responsibility none. Sigh....

Make Stupid Choices Win Stupid Prizes.

Was possible alternate outcome, simply kids ""camp"" environment unacceptable risk, since many/most cases cannot counted expected social distance and/or mask properly. Now, take parents mix, camp social distancing mask requirements, happened pretty much expected outcome.

I hope kids end taking COVID-19 back households and/or extended families, especially anyone high/higher risk negative outcome COVID-19 infection.

Bottom line....

Sigh... relatively old study

This version posted June 16, 2020. hope speedy recovery increased oeroxide concentation significant contributor death rate, suppose antioxidants eat help.
During decomposition hydrogen peroxide forms radicals reacts anything meet, means increased cell damage. Blueberry season started, time fill freezer. **Short answer yes, realistic people continue change behavior make social distancing mask wearing common.**

A virus burn rate transmission 1. (R0 &lt; 1).

People said herd immunity around 50%-65% COVID-19 estimated R0 2 3, numbers thrown around way are. They're using simple formula figure Herd Immunity:

**Herd Immunity = (R0 - 1.0) / R0**

|R0|Equation|Herd Immunity Percent|
|:-|:-|:-|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 2|(2.0 - 1.0) / 2.0|50.0%|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 2.5|(2.5 - 1.0) / 2.5|60.0%|
|COVID-19 assuming R0 = 3.0|(3.0 - 1.0) / 3.0|66.6%|
|Polio (R0 \~ 5)|(5 - 1.0) / 5|80.0%|
|Measles (R0 \~ 12)|(12 - 1.0) / 12|91.6%|
|COVID-19 Social Distancing assuming tranmission halfed (R0 \~ 1.25 )|(1.25 - 1.0) / 1.25|20.0%|

The higher R0, people need infected bend curve back down. lower R0, less people need infected disease starts dissipate own. lower closer 1 wearing masks, social distancing, employing hard lockdowns, etc. could increase pushing people crowded public transit, stadiums, nightclubs, etc. make sense, numbers currently rising deaths lag numbers. agree part.

Will bad March/April? Maybe, right now, we're testing more, identifying more, milder cases younger individuals, some, somewhat effective approaches treatment. could bad March/April assume so. baseless lol tracking pair long time they've infamous attacking many countries. pair also left behind malware issue means computer systems need flushed potentially cause delays. Every delay means dead. also attacked military installations time certainly less robin hood-esque. Yes, going take time people get used it. needed start February, better never felt somewhat elitist posting days ago difference education level completed Florida Massachusetts question compliance recommendations public health officials. already states article family best wear masks. Didn’t take long all. Another day, another mind-boggling milestone: 4 million people U.S. tested positive coronavirus. U.S. hit 3 million mark 15 days That's according tracker Johns Hopkins 143,700 people died virus U.S. — nearly twice many Brazil, country second highest number fatalities. 

Hoping point, mask mandates help flatten overall curve. But, almost looks like every hotspot that, pop place. I'm blanket terms whole thing variable dynamics it. yes many many cases aware likely never know true impact it. political career over. DC public schools fight right it. DCPS decides open, teachers planning striking supposedly. Union pissed what's going far. teachers, large part, say willing risk lives guaranteed parents/students follow procedures either inside outside schools putting everyone around risk.

I honestly blame agree takes 1 irresponsible person goodness knows plenty country.

Northern VA schools MD schools area watching slowly going fully online fall. happening area COVID fairly contained compared many places. Yeah i’m California several close friends aren’t taking seriously all. Still sticking “it won’t kill get it” approach shows really don’t much thought capabilities.

It’s also worth noting every person know isn’t taking seriously historically made bad decisions lives work mediocre jobs real future planned out. Yes apparently right populating nursing homes sick people. swear hero worship Cuomo blood directly hands absolutely amazing. nominate [Governor really bad sell stock? entire world knew bad. Except Americans, apparently.

There's nothing wrong using globally known information decide sell stocks People find weirdest things brag Oh -- see -- he's losing it. WTF? gotten better treatments, less older people getting infected, hospitals seem prepared treat it. mutation infectious too. might less deadly (this would make sense) know. got person results hour. took 4 days mail results. think continued heightened awareness cleanliness sanitizing. 

My hope mask wearing sick becomes normalized, least US. would really help us cold flu season, nothing else. 

Beyond that, think things go back relative normal pandemic over. People want travel again, hug friends family, go eat, etc. completely pointless imo require masks fly allow take mask eat drink. would feel sitting next someone without mask sit entire flight mask on? person there, mask entire time snacking away. person brought food mask whenever want eat? dont think fair say people allowed take masks even minute completely undermines entire operation youre trying do? everyone breathing circulated air.

*i say dont fly yes, allowing people remove masks I'd agree think big part recent infections US gatherings. People general seem incapable realizing invite family friends over, there's good chance one might infected asymptomatic (or symptomatic dumb realize might covid). bunch strangers came house want wear mask, reason family comes house people can't grasp dangerous knows family members exposed to. One case turn dozen family spreads across others households. step daughter comes home visit let without mask - 19 year old brain thinks Dad weird, incapable believing might infected. way adjust rate spread increased testing better measure actual spread? Foster farms, seafood processing place. Never again. make thru shift either. Also Floridaman county example Thursday would 0% positive OPs DOH county report metric Fran would’ve previously tested positive. county doesn’t count people who’ve tested positive multiple times. count positives once, negatives multiple times.

I think actually count both.

They report ""percent positive *labs*"", counts include number people department received PCR antigen laboratory results day. People
tested multiple days included day new result received. person counted day are
tested, regardless whether multiple specimens tested multiple results received. person positive specimen and
a negative specimen day, positive result counted.

And also count ""percent positivity *new cases*"", percent number people test PCR- antigen-positive first time divided people tested day,
excluding people previously tested positive.

So Thursday example, Fran Florida's second positive test would count positive ""percent positive labs"" calculation ""percent positivity new cases"" calculation.  satire?

When know? Chinese Anthony Fauci discovered 1.14 several hours grilling Wuhan officials. national approved PCR test 1.16. say week late going public this. 

And America 1.16? 1.21? February? Laugh Chinese people eating bats, calling hoax, bungling tests. 

What china February January? Cancelling chinese new years, closing schools, locking everyone houses, isolating mild cases building new hospitals.

If locals anything now, volunteer based shelter-at-home nothing. Meanwhile Abbot anything help them, anyone else Texas. still can't believe last week said would state-wide effects curb this. Petty little things like limiting bars like putting bandaid severed limb. Let alone asshats like bar Arlington openly defying orders remaining open.

But exception UK European nations posting single low double digit (Sweeden 10) death numbers. 100 times deaths per day, long till pass them.

The US #11 deaths per capita #10 cases per capita. may stay bit since Brazil pass us deaths pass France.

Of course, worry passing major European nations cases, already did. places cases per capita nations like Qutar, French Guiana, Bahrain, San Marino.

Europe already deaths cases, portion far, probably 100,000 deaths expect people infected today-which would put us #3 behind San Marino Belgium Peru, Chile, UK keep Wait...people actually believed stuff? 1. scientific paper show 200.000 deaths prevented kin Italy works!

These dip shits never allowed open sit-down. Takeout curbside only. Well force people look gor volunteers course. really think much change. Maybe sanitizing stuff think that's it. Arkansas, guy anti-everything years now. tried everything could abolish medical marijuana (took 3.5 years ballot availability him) also extremely anti-science, anti-progress. first say thoughts prayers anything anyone himself... 


So, tots pears Senator.

EDIT:
Thank kind Sir/Madam gilding me! First all, “wrong sense safe” complete speculation. find way probable people give consideration wear mask first place also following social distancing measures. Seems ridiculous infer opposite like sort psychologist. 

Also touching face moot point tbh. apparently touch face 15.7 times hour. Given sort statistics, I’d bet it’s negligible difference adding putting face mask make difference need compare wearing mask regards infection chance. I’ll try keep min next time see happens. Good idea thank you. That's called challenge trial arguing done test vaccine efficacy.

As imagine, numerous ethical issues this. talking delay, I'm talking backlog, related different. Backlog many samples they've taken yet tested. backlog growing, means delays getting worse worse they've hit limit testing abilities. There's slight difference celiac disease comes bunch shit like fatigue others well intolerance gluten, people gluten intolerant mild upsets like runs stomachs cramps feeling bit sick nothing usually, theres big difference 2 gluten intolerance common sometimes people say celiac disease even gluten intolerance, hope clears bit :) written even first video, I'd wager time Covid, anyway. fast food, stuff like chinese takeout pizza. Still sure about... guess... Reassuring others read way too. sounds awesome! mean, we're middle pandemic requires social distancing (among things), hospital nearing capacity (and starting choose save) 2 hurricanes coming up! Texas really working way reduce population splendid pace!  need reinfection studies non-human primate model settle issue all. challenge trials? Must nice population believes doctors scientists instead anti-vaxxer, flat earthers, masks high school dropout tells covid fake. read ""coordinated leadership"" started worrying bipartisan political situation. DeSantis graduate Harvard Law School. I'm afraid he's dumb, uninformed. think must actually somewhat evil. mean, he's willing literally *kill* residents state misinformation possibility incrementally increased chance winning re-election two years. sick, consequences.

DeSantis, alone, literally made remember lyrics song thought forever: ""Murder Numbers,"" Police.

""But reach top profession

Yep! system right keep people away society. might \*side effect\*, broken justice system far likely cause adolescent offenders become worse time, potentially - eventually released - commit crimes. complain votes November... remember bit obesity witch hunt around here. One victim head shot, guy claiming obese, else we'd see full body picture. yeah wait till ppl start running money, pissed trump claim ""emergency"" voting November. likely part reason anything. aware going happen.

Clearly, 1 10 murcans braindead, inbred, dipshit, fucktards....so 1 10 think schools open unrestricted....doesn't make sense. country mask mandate? Y'all scared yet nar? Oh please. entirely self inflicted. Stop blaming others blame system. saying white people oppress non-Asian minorities, give Asians higher privilege white people themselves? got it.  maybe cause breaks like every ethics code hypocritic oath think dumb hear people bitching it, guess we're impasse.

Funny would project issues since I'm mirroring you. ""what little liberties left"" LOL

Boy know dramatic. I'd love people experience like live TRULY oppressed society. This. Personal responsibility people. Yep. Food deserts also happen due crime, mostly results people poor &amp; feeling powerless due that. US incredibly sick *mostly* due severe systemic inequality issues. smdh actually got hit first populated area course deaths more. one fuck sent people back nursing homes big fuck deserves criticized rest response deserves praised. got populated area country control bunch Republicans states epicenters right now. death rates Republican states going surpass new yorks easily end years especially idiots open schools. cant see difference responses lack critical thinking. would agree company went business due regular circumstances.

In ideal world worry we'd fully automated luxury communism. Idk want see normal vaccine looks like especially whatever ends happening winter close get think widespread mask usage going stay it’s sanitary it’s good way stay healthy also social distancing guess peter people aren’t geared live like feel Las Vegas casino cleaner school, church, gym, movie theater. 

Between insane ventilation systems fact already used cleaning thousands people day would trust damn near indoor activities point. He's got hard competition ahead Abbott. opinion, importance hand hygiene cannot overemphasized due absence evidence revealing hand hygiene reduces transmission SARS-CoV-2. 

Indeed. Obviously, best practice hand hygiene touch face. However, seen single confirmed case fomite transmission. Yeah, that’s strategy. sucks. Trump: Keep America ~~Great~~ Dying looks like Pulmonary embolism due COVID-19 America LOVES fucking around south america. Nope. gets bit complicated. State church separated law Germany. Merkel party CDU mostly don’t care religion despite Christian name. region Bavaria CDU CSU, CDU Bavarian region. Bavaria Texas Germany, bit conservative Christian northern parts. care Christianity religious influence comparison US quite low. case numbers indication

They aren't, death rate lags case rate several weeks. case numbers leveling now, death rates peak 2-3 weeks. beginning surge. states 100+ deaths day need hit brakes close non-essential businesses. 

If Florida Texas choose reopen schools looking deadly fall winter. neither! said above, think robust adolescent mental health system (to hopefully catch sort thing caused harm), well thoughtful justice system power offer appropriate, society-protecting sentencing within framework ""this person's brain literally fully developed"".   States' Rights!

Whoa! fast, *cities*. think emphasis “for us”, also lack personnel staff beds, much less move critically ill patients around state size Texas.  mean, shows Republicans can't think critically. Assuming good intentions (perhaps invalid assumption..), wary hurting economy they've made recovery much harder. strong federal response would made shut time much shorter would trackable small number cases. turns economy recover quickly people uncertain future labor incapacitated disease. 

What fucking dumbasses people presenting false choice public health economy. hurts know stupid fuckers are. Closing borders “late” ineffective. done much earlier. Closing borders pretty much like shutting areas, shutting areas ineffective China shutoff Wuhan. hotspots general shutoff like Italy Spain did?

South Korea one successful countries handling virus. Look Pakistan, opened border initially shut China, China diplomatically pressured them. Pakistan today?  spread people, food, makes sense. Winning? live near headquarters uncomfortably close CEO. I’ve heard rumors prays shift. 

I’m anti-religious feel like personal thing church work. They’re brand Christianity controlling. they’re way, wouldn’t able buy serve alcohol county. I’ve friends went big company gathering. 2 cruise ships CFA owners &amp; corporate headquarters. casinos closed, alcohol. fact, made cover bars didn’t even see it. FUCK YEAH!!!!  countries pretty okay. aren't, LOONNGGGG way go things get bas Sweden. 

Sweden unnecessarily killed thousands people. Pepee le Pew?  need like one study people better sick person caugh minutes see get reinfected. would science makes think dont want answer. sad actually really ""big one"". literally simple pandemic got blown proportion due dumb leadership. could easily mitigated via masks society, still debating masks REALLLY real. :( I'm pretending better anyone lol taking comment hard? think dumb people derail thread stupid joke. Spend less time internet probably inferiority complex seem have.  Looks way us too.  technically 2019 plague, that's semantics PTSD Sorry mate, thought American / Canadian.

Title ""Use masks could possibly worse using one."" political climate intellectual's worst nightmare. pandemic revealing ugliness always present. trying argue, understand.

The article says nowhere put patients. whole state Texas neighboring states ICU beds spare us,""

Then two sentences July 22, 11,461 55,263 hospital beds available statewide, 1,088 ICU beds open.

I wish article said this. Wow. loses -- blue tsunami. Nope! try adult ensure society protected. robust adolescent mental health program, well justice system adolescents able examine needs needs society offer appropriate sentencing. vaccine comes expect come country like Romania/Hungary/etc. ? Even costs lot money? Mhm like gonna disappear now. 😐 assumed would take couple years people would want wait would take amass data develop methodology. could totally wrong though. area expertise all.  americans going die *en masse* unlike previous weeks hospitals saturated triage happen, like Italy. Trump's family rich rich, Dad/Grandma made wealth ruthless educated NY's booming growth years. excuse DJT raised spoilt, rotten human own. US sends people, they’re sending best. They’re sending you. They’re sending you. They’re sending people lots health problems, they’re bringing problems us. They’re bringing coronavirus. They’re bringing masks. They’re infected untested. some, assume, good people. Coronavirus could worse many ways. anyone disagree? Nah, it’s health experts “worst nightmare”.... significantly decrease coronavirus cases Make Texas Mexico Again. 

Just like that, disappear.  particular, I've heard people like stand-up comics Brendan Schaub Bryan Callen justify recklessness grounds ""once get it, good.""  blithe assumption, they've infected people left right (in course getting initial infection). Oh please. wealthy parent means get kid educated pandemic make terrible person comprehend suffering others. I'm sure child means let miss education either; make bad message: ""See, money keep safe little people.""

You think Bill Gates told kids that? Equating wealth lack values kindness shitty stereotype basis reality. Yes, lot shitty rich people world. also lot shitty poor people well yet see throwing stereotypes them. Lol almost sounds like pulmonary embolism. scary stuff. (not all) people born wealth idea planning ahead actually is.  100% predicted!!!! Argh. Twice deaths Cali lately per capita. Twice deaths. Twice positivity rate. 

Holy fuck man. I'm boat. I'm LPN working urgent care Disney World Florida.


I heard virus back January gut feeling telling going fucking disasterous hit United States. told people going hit us badly thought crazy overly dramatic. Even experienced coworkers seem particularly concerned. 


Management told believe media hyping much tell patients flu. concerns patients recently traveled Europe dismissed country traveled list high risk countries time (February, March-ish). 1 2 days later, virus officially declared pandemic.


I horrified officials said masks useless. Telling people masks work different message telling people use washable cloth masks surgical masks reserved healthcare workers. fathom wearing mask *wouldn't* help reduce spread respiratory virus. 


I want say, ""I told so,"" paying price. Yup. paid boss (at first). wasn't, left. phones sold via AT&amp;T carrier locked AT&amp;T, much providers.

Really? thought way like 7 years so. least customer good standing months least. Democrat areas AKA urban areas.  fake news! number 1 world cases deaths! sucks though... well doesnt suck family sucks... pressure put disgusting. Also $1m wont ""donated"" went straight non profit ""distribute see fit"" would love see $90k actually gets distributed. rural area, regardless state, find masks people. Unless go one big retail chain stores require them, even see people take inside. live rural CA, place people wear mask walmart. that's can't get inside without one. high quality information. read article, contain reliable, fact-based information. 

Please stop discriminately labeling everything conspiracy. flew Southwest everyone mask almost entire flight. Granted flight fairly empty still. school year starts July are? obese

There's nothing borderline obesity. He's way border. Suits help. republican center reddit cheers. democrat centrist knives come out. ""I'm sorry sir/ma'am, based chances survival need return home die. glorious leader deemed acceptable loss corporate overlords continue show profits next quarter. President thanks sacrifice."" ... far American Express Petal helping all. can’t pay dime right now. They’ve resorted harassing parents. offer deferment. yeah, think it’s ridiculous since menthol cigarettes still available. can't get enough sugar crisp! Fauci wasn’t available respond 1918 flu pandemic. many developments since time waste. Although US squandered time rejected information much rest world done well. 

John Barry’s book “The Great Influenza” good job explaining 1918 pandemic terms ability comprehend respond. You’re absolutely correct despite information responded shamefully similar ways. don’t continue so. 

Part able respond better appreciating history. Fauci contribute that. need understand happens within scientific community leaders reject science. That’s double peak Great Recession Germany lot overweight people many obese ones. tell tracking around Covid happening big cities way factual,when authorities refuse ask relevant questions fear called racist idiots internet?

And make things clearly think protests OK protest whatever want long want,BUT second ppl group start trowing explosives ,brinks,molotovs,looting etc cops stand let commit crimes group longer peaceful protest ,its violent riot provides cover criminals accomplice.

What happening Portland violent riot point,go search online full videos actually happening read articles go watch videos ,the net full clips rioters setting fire fencing breaking windows,doors etc federal building, violence personally afraid one days someone going take things far ,hurt federal agent inside building rest well armed geared federal agents going open fire using real bullets. paywall... Trump never really cared public health security. He's shown time time he's position leverage maximum benefit himself, family, wealthy associates finally ""allies"" order. Allies anybody, people political capital follow even self interest. 

Covid really bad buddies. get nearly money rapidly wants return normal squeeze much money opportunity can, even expense country's health safety. knows what's happen November, administration make sure get ""their due"" anything else happens. going full conspiracy theory try allow people entirely abdicate sense personal agency responsibility, fucking absurd. Pumping foods full sugar, fat salt something new happening time; plenty us still understand excuse gluttony inactivity. I'm genuinely concerned immense amount deaths, long term health impacts Americans. 

Some survivors reporting reduced health even virus ""gone."" Like residual fatigue, reduced lung capacity, etc. There's way knowing yet many people lingering health problems despite surviving COVID19. find really scary Combined fact overweight likely religious (Aliyah term used describe Jews immigrating Israel) I’m surprised died. I, 2 others job tested positive. shut down. sucks. People keep going out. taking seriously. Y'all seen Walmarts Houston? They're breeding ground. Yep.

Especially since cases bad (even now) competitively would easy let guard down. dunno. could Trump do? local police already ordered stop enforcing federal laws working feds. really governors mayors point. sure still expecting ever ""eradicated"". probably lower something slightly worse flu widespread vaccination treatments probably stay. goal lower infections (and severity them) enough resume normal life. Fauci says here, occur combination herd immunity aforementioned vaccines treatments. See, know nation live think beauty America live life way want live way. I'm convinced loss bag. last century chances losing reelection fairly low. sitting safe echo chamber Reddit, might seem Trump losing credibility, take much step away site see lots people say Trump best president.

I'll believe see it. Optimistically, think voters moved actually get vote now, time yet tell. He'll, probably see much one day. One striking result poll reported here: 80% Texans approve statewide mask mandate. Even Texas, anti-mask sentiment becoming fringe view. always wrong statements lol That's certainly reach, unreasonable hospitals slightly fudge numbers get ""relief funding"" pleasure speaking two individuals last week separate occasions informing lot deaths part bigger plan inflate numbers. idiots recounted anecdotal story someone killed motorcycle accident subsequently tested positive COVID19 therefore counts covid death.

Seems like matter what, people can’t/don’t understand something choice turn cOnSpIrAcY tHeOrIeS. weakest bullshit answer I've ever seen attempts downplay absolute, disgusting lack leadership dealing crisis. 

Trump limp dicked around day mumbling incoherent oxymorons ""China flu"", inject bleach, masks problems, etc etc. absolutely nothing substance actually improve situation... Except plan. plan? form plan. Fucking brilliant mind there.

""No one else could done better"" ass, get shit here. link mean, defending country enslaves citizens. Feels little disingenuous ignore prison labor feel like people deserve slavery. Here's hint, that's excuse every proslavery society uses. wearing mask elevated level attempted murder allow people force wear mask way choose people allowed stop felonies progress way choose.

It evil expect innocent people sit infected deadly virus someone else's entertainment convenience.

Instead downvoting running like cowards hide, dont folks explain think right get people sick deadly disease will.  How’s economy doing, mr President? worthless piece shit. reckon like one person blown proportion. Oh yeah. would definitely go local drug store dose that! matter boot repair trust cobbler sound middle high school teachers retiring Cry more. Soros paid destroy America I’m going anywhere gonna start making America great again? Wouldn’t murder? Genuinely asking HEY TALK PRESIDENT WAY! HE'S BORDERLINE OBESE! OBESE! Even threat law many Americans won't. That's issue.

Since ""mandatory enforced"" mask laws States, many wearing them? I'd say since there's zero enforcement. Cause people scared Karen's capitulated them.

Seems western countries, people listen law, otherwise really bother. parents way. GAVE stack masks fucks sake, go ""I'll wear store asks to."" Yup, sure is. difference medical field history exploitation, human experimentation without consent, pushing drugs knowingly harmful, often kids, make profit nefarious purposes. see aviation techs knowingly selling plans planes fall apart sky. geologists telling people safe move active volcano knowing gonna blow 5 years. medical industry completely different. 

Tuskegee syphilis experiments, MK Ultra, doctors pushing adderall kids, opiate epidemic, pushing xanax like harmless, countless times doctors knowingly pushed false information bad drugs financial gain, discrediting new alternate treatment methods maintain profit, price gouging life saving drugs, history forced sterilizations ""invalids"", purported use vaccines used sterilize women Kenya, US syphilis experiments Guatemala, could keep going on. examples medical industry used knowingly harm people profit otherwise staggering. 

Not saying sure thats happening situation, peoples general distrust medical industry warranted tbh.  Sorry grandfather.

Forgive me, though, stick thousands experts *here* instead notions, right?

The US ever shut properly, we're seeing premature ""reopening"" going pretty much unchecked spread, especially states. result we're going suffer much more, much longer, countries shut sooner harder, since openings actually controllable. economy suffer specifically used half-measures. Waiting offers Aliexpress Trump's wet dream, Holocaust Hitler Jr. how?! He's American?! Could imagine, conservatives would acting, Clinton election bungling Covid response poorly Trump has?

It really sucks mainstream media always talk foreign issues care fix domestic problems check pneumonia stats places. pretty. took cpr 2 years ago 2 breaths every 30 compressions, change time emphasize compressions breaths, wouldn’t surprised change it. reason compare two daily rate Corona reached 1k Tuesday, daily cancer deaths 1300. think coronavirus completely blown proportion, dangerous certain populations Air recirculated frequently airplane ICU. even herd immunity 40%..

there 4 million infected, 140k dead.

&amp;#x200B;

40% (US 320,000,000)

is 132,000,000 infections.

&amp;#x200B;

which means 128,000,000 left.

so..

32x 4,000k many people die America gains herd immunity

Always breeding ground it’s corona mental health impact disasters economic downturns well-established since 1930s. federal government even released manual Mental Health Workers Disaster Relief back 1978. Canadian, approve message Illinois got free test via national guard site town heard back next day still remain literal thing do. They'll help little bit, margins. Especially areas spread really kicked yet...

Absolutely nothing prevent South go next couple weeks. thought genetics, class? Jeeze many excuses people fat, almost choice... american mostly peanuts is. Every action taking made cause maximum chaos. Thus latest gestapo-like tactics sending Federal Troops “quell” “uprisings”. He’s absolute worst worse. 

And republicans/conservatives eating up. ideology laid bare. policies except think trigger libs. It’s shit show. unless Trump gets thrown office election, along sycophantic republicans, don’t see republic stand. sane people world, Team Orange's actions evil fact get away essentially proof god exist least care enough.

To Team Orange, they're *isn't* pure evil *because* getting struck almighty they're doing. Except example isnt. Feds arent sent control virus. protests helping. I'm peaceful protests, there's way least one protester infected. Keep mind hospitals fill, death rate goes fully agree 100%, think rest Australia follow suit. America *definitely* take piece playbook. True grocery bill rising it. wonder two things related. give ideas. stream air goes via small valve much bigger pressure breath single cloth mask face. 

I'm going call BS here.  2 nostrils smaller single valve 3M N95 masks have. Fucking idiot. serious *at all*, forget he's immigrant. bad. Thank you, exactly point! article paints picture we're worse actually things gotten much better. /r/oddlyspecific Wasn’t never SARS vaccine? What’s different one? give medical advice kill people Since able clarify meant, assume total nonsense. Well really it’s like three month trend NJ fair  Well, freedom cost family member's lives Eeenteresting! could either classified nonsensical gossip (no offense) foreigner (you) know anything, bit imported worker/scandalous insight really ""classified"" island get allotted yet (as maybe workers foreigners). 

Because we've two cases verbally told ""from Abaco"" (which Bakers Bay is), put ""COVID Tracker"" Abaco yet (we assumed point oversight updated). 

So... fact workers brought Covid elsewhere, might might classify ""Abaco"" cases yet ?

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry ramble. introduced either totally unreliable gossip juicy details blissfully unaware point. Either way change much except much might need examine foreign workers. would good news. link? 3 days CA Kaiser. partner hand went county we're day 9 waiting results (that ontop wait 10 days onset symptoms even get test!). wouldn’t fair everyone already survived COVID. /s Really. means Kentucky Virus Every lb lost improves health. keep it, becomes self motivating progress make. Best luck! feel colleges universities opening up? Thanks insight Thats thing, role response really needed “parrot experts make sure state governors employing science based pandemic response plans”.

All listen repeat, something know unable surrounds yes men sycophants. Since literally gets info Infowars Fox News like said, yesmen going parrot bullshit can. Hence “chinese democrat hoax”. 

I also remember discussion early invoking DPA fix supply issues early on. I’m sure would’ve helped dont know details enough say wether could done this. paper dont see not. 2 weeks postive cases spike believe something leader 

Or rely one leader anymore. Thank that. strike iron hot, scary we're super bunkered things settle bit... even Massachusetts, we're weary tidal wave covid rising south. Next solar flare! bet read article twenty guy's 8 figure medical bill four months. goes WAY beyond OSHA, think rises beyond mere tort. know much criminal law, bullshit machine activated meatpacking industry (agnotology severity outbreaks hysteric scare stories meat shortages shipped unprecedented tons pork China) seems like criminal enterprise me! 90+ people killed infectious disease deliberately spread followers nihilistic Imam would half Arabian peninsula turned parking lot now! .

In general I'm fan 'respectable' covid skeptics (I actually like really unhinged ones better), really outdid one. Here, informed Yale alumnus pantywaist [Alexander 'team Apocalypse' made big deal nothing regards Smithfield plant outbreak checked South Dakota death data found one 44 died since outbreak began...

I guess smooth-handed Ivy League graduates kind evidence one died Smithfield plant! all, long let work places? 10 years? get lifetime pension nice little farm Connecticut, right? Right? course, two workers Smithfield plant (both 60s) die (before tweet made)! Despicable!

To top off, company prominent covid skeptic simping (Smithfield) owned Chinese interests!!! industry took ad NYT warning meat shortage exports China record levels!!! absolutely possible reason suffer industry vital security stability owned company easily pressured foremost geopolitical adversary. 

The Hawley/Cotton wing right join center left ensure swift justice criminals permanently secure food supply future generations! Everyone involved, President line managers face kind truth reconciliation commission!

edit: fixed typo good question. gut tells me, odd may sound, best way convince anti-masker comment whether wearing mask. (Obviously live one whole different question.) then, literal pile corpses finally convinces them, start wear mask, comment either. COMMENT. accept it, move normal social relations - normal possible. 

Yeah... dunno, man. thinking important thing get everyone fence wearing mask correctly completely possible, save *all* us. actual anti-masker lost cause, needs avoided like plague, literally are. ...rly?  think pandemic business usual therefore good time baby, hope fuck NEVER reproduce. ever good reason hold producing another human being, would GLOBAL PANDEMIC.

I already gave two huge differences Indy 500 protests yet - since arguments - brought back conversation new topic.

You’re entitled opinion. very, respectfully disagree. WTF

Half Florida doesn’t even discernible seasons storm troopers

You mean officers DHS patches vests, shoulders, gear? ones clearly identifiable federal agents? actually fascinatingly old coping mechanism- laughing face death doom traced back vikings. actually core Nordic mythology. Google ""the northern theory courage."" 70% herd immunity works. 140k dead already. 140k X 7 = 980,000 dead. I'm sure curve, still, lot die unless something fast. continue current rate 1000 per day, we'll hit 155000+140000=295,000 end year. game changer could every report younger person's death included obese/overweight not. titanic time avoid iceberg. case, US saw iceberg radar days reaching accelerated towards it, dropping empty lifeboats way looks like daily cases US might starting downward trend, per John Hopkins dashboard. would think sign getting worst. even attempt post anything anymore. But..but..all 'experts' hate radio say kids totally safe harm corona! Even idiots governors like Missouri agree!

Throw open thoses school doors 'Murca send little children their...fate? New Jersey state governor calling people failing social distance “knuckleheads”. Gotta imagine that’s key factor! 

But seriously Gov Murphy done awesome job NJ. key creating culture. Everyone every store wears mask that’s pandemic, beginning. 

Another thing respected balanced. opened parks beaches little early recognizing can’t keep people completely cooped activities relatively low risk It’s logistical curve still sucks growing side handshakes destroy immune system? answer may surprise you...more break. We’ve aware asymptomatic cases since like February I’m done reddit. place hopeless, enjoy rage mate. cast stone Nov President Shitstain told advisors want know blowing China.

And way now. Nature virus way. 

But remember this... going back beginning models science folk called exactly right. 

Which means tomorrow worse.

Take chance dig 

[Timeline Coronavirus Pandemic U.S. Response | Security. follows comprehensive timeline major U.S. policy events related novel coronavirus pandemic. We’ve focused U.S. government’s preparation pandemic, tracking warning signals COVID-19, public internal responses outbreak hit inside United States.

In view, timeline clear: Like previous administrations, Trump administration knew years pandemic gravity possible imminently plausible. Several Trump administration officials raised strong concerns prior emergence COVID-19 raised alarms virus appeared within United States. 


In response COVID-19, United States slow act time day inaction mattered most–in terms eventual public health harms well severe economic costs. President closest senior officials also disseminated misinformation left public less safe vulnerable discounting severity pandemic. 

When came time minimize loss life economic damage, United States unnecessarily underprepared, sacrificed valuable time, confronted pandemic mild response public health experts recommended. lapses meant United States ultimately forced make drastic economic sacrifices catch severity pandemic would otherwise necessary. ...] Absolutely disgusting. brought home. think much evidence likely. Typically outbreaks fast food/take restaurants mostly among staff. transferred food, imagine spread would mostly infecting customers, probably large numbers. love talking point. realize guy came day said NY right. state far highest death rate. Science praising worst numbers apparently. guy playing narrative get TV. got little fame needed more. networks wanted say way cure corona spit people’s mouths would. you? 

Any successful path forward necessarily includes medical spending. 

Refusing like refusing put small house fire extinguisher would mean buying new extinguisher afterward refuse put money pocket ""big extinguisher"". Winter is... here? reading category labeled ""car occupants"". I'm reading ""all motor vehicle accidents"". Take another look. took one year odds ""all motor vehicle accidents"", 8303, dividing 17, number years lived 18. understand rough way estimating odds dying car accident 18. source specifically documents figure, I'll happy take look it.


You take steps realistically possible protect family car accidents. would involve never setting foot motor vehicle. would involve moving changing careers family commute car. car equivalent recommending coronavirus. Taking kids school unacceptable burden way never setting foot car unacceptable burden. Well, percent positive would higher. testing 10,000 samples daily New York City (as example) today 6% positive, month later 12% positive, testing amount samples, means people sick. Trump symptom (and contributing factor) general problem polarization - asymmetric right particular. United States divided country. Democrat says sky blue 40% country say AKTUALY find way cast doubt general observation sake political points. structural factors intensify divide. That's scary. Anytime serious crisis demands immediate unity country, Republicans balk align Democrats. I'm increasingly believing USA longer superpower assumed lacks capabilities resources, domestic politics crippled it. first responders hospital workers they'd shift one day, folks they'd schedule like flu shots sure sensitive hearing demographic waves businesses live die on. point though wouldn’t geographic makeup US slow spread. Meaning densely populated areas hit would slow thru rural regions? Well maybe stop talking Florida clearly California running infected state.... supposed be, doesn’t mean every restaurant it. way outbreak considered two people test positive two week span. [Always Gov DeathSentence come new excuse everyday. Wonder excuse tomorrow really dumb. NYC place deaths blew US, seen thing take place countries. much thinking face masks meant finally going take virus seriously. Absolute jackwad. fuck ""rosy"" about? love it. choose lunch today, portion like. Stop blaming others, within everybody's control. I'm entirely sure, confirmed yesterday biggest lab state, Sonora Quest, 61,000 backlogged tests. Statewide could 100,000 tests waiting analyzed. Many two weeks old. one? PR bored?

Another abbey, outbreak either. third, priests teach another local private school, again, outbreak. social media three, heavily advocated social distancing, masks, virtual services. I'm religious, honestly content putting really comforting supportive safe protective communities. clear trying absolute best.

As outbreak, nursing home incorrectly classified district.

Edit: story sad though. Anything like convent abbey would much risk nursing home, perhaps even so. ways isolate them, much still focused community, mention also elderly well. agreement, I’m pretty sure positive humor coping mechanism linked positive outcomes experienced many research articles this. Sarcastic/negative/humor used demean others correlated positive outcomes however (like poster keeps mocking/making fun of/implying go somewhere else guy trying light hearted).

(Source: trauma survivor years therapy - COVID related). lying. Sweden thriving, knew doing. Good job Sweden 👏🇸🇪 I’m saying.

But specificity, medical field practice. Things always change new discoveries. Nothing changes pilot. pilot pilot, doctor medical practitioner. medicine practice kind see susceptible (unfortunately) people listen it. “powerful, able, democratic countries tremendous internal capacities deal disease”

The problem capabilities organization (or lack thereof). three countries, India best chance simply leader batshit insane leaders two. He’s right, New York California two liberal democratic states highest cases, Florida got spike spring breakers northern states bringing there.  facts are, liberal democratic states cities, rona cases thru roof, isn’t anybody blaming democratic leaders. Instead blame Trump. ban customers.

It bullshit siding people trying get employees sick deadly disease. Good. 

They need it. Wow website shit hole mobile. like 45 ads load. best err side caution. friend's grandpa moved senior condo complex felt many elderly going back &amp; forth medical appointments matter time someone caught covid. unfortunately FL retirement community still number seniors think fine go play majong poker neighbors, movie nights. Truthfully, masking common areas really hinder transmission since spread close contact friend groups. mandatory masking helps signal community take seriously stop socializing! politicians corrupt, system flawed, Trump guys would complaining someone else. Instead complaining, something proactive educate people around you. No, never implied would full herd immunity within couple weeks. FHM talked would able see effects partial immunity within certain parts population. see now. Nowhere near full herd immunity, definitely immunity. There's definitely portion those, agree I've seen lot it.

There's also lot parents recognize able get work done kids home trying work home. employers requiring go back work, fall-back childcare America used using public school primary form weekday child support, summer camps etc.

But regardless motivation, frustrating see people either deluding believing, fed misleading information about, virus harmless kids certainty therefore responsibly put contact large groups people unprotected uncontrollable environment.

And parents going children suffer long term permanent repercussions actions, extremely frustrating.  Chaos reigns! Unfortunately keeping virus away elderly Florida exercise futility. Florida full elderly. Nursing homes can't quarantine indefinitely staff families lives outside them. question regarding lower herd immunity amounts, that's zero percent chance right. Every new day's numbers proves wrong never allow GOP gain power realistic. take look 25% infected estimate. Absolutely spike new cases Ok, well thanks making clear desperate discount possibility majority Americans might financial straights things least partially beyond control. record, I'm not. I'm 20%. I'm looking excuse.

Great response. Or, what’s point using condom, everyone going get STD anyways.  Seems like me. reality healthcare US government stressing ANYTHING going work here. CDC, Mayo Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, websites, pages facts, figures, information obesity. People interested favorite movie star health. Try talking anyone body -- watch eyes glaze over. care they'll listen -- dont care. wish could that. Check facebook ignorantly think smarter doctors, don’t want follow advice, let treat reserve beds others. talking point. idea one party lie silly. I'll keep voting democrat.  LMAO put meth pipe down.

All look reopen vids, like one posted. ONE wearing mask. sure fuck first time either. gaurenfuckintee AR-15s masks hillbilly jamborees... disease around five months. definitely identified 30+ distinct risk factor likely find bright glowing line sand fine headed ICU. That's war that's already going time. Could well regulated Militia necessary security freedom state? Yeah, keep mind even many days contact, transmission risk 50%.
I find effort made investigate transmission modes quite inadequate pandemic. Governments around world guesswork allow keep transmission rate 1 keeping economy running. Billions wasted per day, day, decent-sized study survival food, aerosol viral load, sputum viral load etc. bullshit defeats purpose ban. Lol, actually *the* Kovana? That's interesting guess, supported evidence, guesses immune system works. think safe say Canadians generally feel complete shitshow dumpster fire WTF south border right now, absolutely vital keep border shut things get sort control. dont think fair blame school systems case. young people know cautionary social distancing. people protesting lockdowns, middle-aged elderly people. propaganda told Demz made hurt prez. people dont believe / actively fight Anything Changes, minds made up.

Well, show Samsung Nike actively funds groups hate specific group people ill consider stopping buying products.

You draw moral line somewhere thats draw line Texas fully committed putting brick gas pedal. read comments bro.

Just read couple comments mean everyone else thinks way too. 

Weird works. Captain obvious needed US president. Someone could explain basic things simple language (maybe also draw kid understanding friendly pictures). Maybe would fix issues. look tough open throat nose holes heartbreaking rage inducing. 
So much catastrophe preventable. 
We missed chance open schools back May ill-advised reopenings mandatory mask order. 
Don’t kill kiddies teachers administrators. one wants say goodbye friends family video chat. Send stimulus checks. Stay home. Influenza season devastating don’t get control. He'd become bilingual difficult language, would worth lot given powerful China become world stage. would scary though, sending child alone. cares stole it, ... think vaccine would open source project countries speed up..... Ahhh key  


""Large tech companies hope smartwatches replace slowing sales main offerings, pitch consumers wearable gadgets improve lifestyles."" 


Im saying good news sure seems like every good news article kind agenda behind it. Reposted bot didnt like particular word

Again, politicizing means nothing whether good idea not. 

I really dont understand saying evidence masks admitted studies reports last post. first said wasnt ""great evidence"", saying ""no evidence"". it? looking studies specifically put masks covid 19(which around months, decades doctors, surgeons, nurses, etc Germ Theory Disease wear masks operating rooms, go extensive hand washing sanitation practices, proven increase surgical success rates save lives drastically. 

To ignore evidence brought Germ Theory Disease extremely successful medical practice mask relatively uncomfortable crazy. 

Maybe example ""democrats trying control me"" extreme. Would changing ""it's uncomfortable"" ""I freedoms!"" ""my facebook research told harm people"" better? side. farmer oil patch canada, conservative part canada one conservative lines work, know still nowhere near right side US. brother certain big conspiracy theory junkie, facebook like it. end matter. trust proven medical practices party anyday! Yes. believe deaths recorded Corona. Someone told death rate would double counted Texas half many reported. idea stuff comes from. don’t follow news channels. follow CDC, Fauci, BBC, Scientific journals, local data reported etc... try make sense full range info. see reason would double death rates means trick people wearing masks. don’t even know respond people say stuff. end choosing silence dying little inside ignorance all. Yeah also leadership seems care live die, generally much better access healthcare do. 

(Also good looking keeping us out. would fuck situation quickness.)   North American travel ban India, Bangladesh, Pakistan. Crazy people nations seem grasp goes Americans oblivious world offense..alot smart individuals also stupid ones Yeah, like suggestions boil ""if he'd competent, listened experts, good ideas he'd less fucked reelection"".

I think he's capable that. don't. right way think it. Also, humans catch coronaviruses again. particular, NL63 human coronavirus targets ACE2 receptor (just like Sars-CoV2) generates protective immune response lasts 6-12 months. 

This means unlikely we'll able eradicate Sars-CoV2 durable, protective vaccine unlikely ever developed.  know, grandfather also thought hoax &amp; told worry it.

All old people, since started, without mask, complaining restaurants closed, refusing stay home. pull something ass consider 100% prove narrative. rational person obviously proof anything, becomes another stalemate. there, done that. 

Ever climate change denier send links ""Principia Scientific International""? Yeah, dipshit uncle tried once. people, can't even steer discussion place arguments rely kind objective proof. Wow. dropped /s mention debilitating sanctions US allies burdened Venezuela years. Crazy. tested Oklahoma beginning May, 4 days. Clearly things different number tests per day far off... believe death toll chance lasting debilitating effects contracting virus, left unchecked, would less damage?

Edit: removed unnecessary ""don't"" You’re wrong. Google cells. original reopen PA protests far better job BLM wearing masks actually socially distancing since couple hundred people.

I've watching riot live streams like month now, think peacful wearing masks arent paying attention Currently NJ 4th worse case count per 100,000 nation. 

It time relax go beach yet. try use extent lungs then? dont exhale 100percent inhale 100percent? 

Maybe. lot blowing pft told normal catching breath one. exercised long time due feet problems.

The pulmonologist told lungs big healthy. suppose breathing issues revolve around asthma swelling intakes. terms COVID deaths per 100k population, US lower Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France. Quite realistic! Many people pre-existing cross immunity cells coronaviruses — tested negative antibodies infection still developed cells immune. “asymptomatic cases” may also people cell immunity infected experienced disease due killer cells crushing virus. double seroprevalence study percentages easily get 50% higher estimating immunity cells. almost every single metric, U.S. able deal it. paper anyway.

So many family overseas still shock events unfolded U.S. personally know single person contracted covid. consider win.  Mask casket Lol!  Yep, little one's hands washed them. Teenagers much.  refuse spend money place supports hating group people, thats draw line.

But whatever want Yeah, it’s interesting see states different seriously they’ve taken covid. CT got tested two days ago rite aid drive thru got results today clarify secret police? Aren’t federal officers Department Homeland Security? detaining people aren’t seen again? Don’t people get arrested end released hours later date court hearing? 

I heard IDs, names, get doxed otherwise. trying troll rightwing nut loves state power, I’ve heard conflicting stories. Dunning Kruger effect. Antibodies seem last 2-3 months however studies point towards long term immunity cells ones actually keep recipe new antibodies even antibodies anymore body capable reacting fast detects infection creates more, antibodies anymore mean immunity. 


For reason people love tell others immunity real/long lasting antibodies last long fail mention cells. I'm epidemiologist, seems...possible, probable. 

I think likely herd immunity number lower 70% often quoted, probably significantly lower. 

*Something* happening hot spots causes infections drop certain saturation point. **all** discount masks distancing, know that's enormous contributing factor, account mind. 

I think we'll know sure except hindsight, though.   far 2a concerned clear statistical connection strength gun laws deaths per 100000. Stronger gun laws, fewer deaths.

However, mask debate shown us guns somehow symbol freedom. ability buy guns designed hunting optimized kill humans needed freedom peoples mind.

With number threats jokes read Reddit alone guns used liberals frightening. 

I hunt. couple shotguns, 30-06, revolver grandpa used rode range. would like see higher bar gun ownership. Even suggesting prospect real trigger though. call Vegas it’s gets dirty AF. That’s LOT equipment keep clean all. article goes detail how.  Agreed. real. Texas I’ve scared shitless. Unless user elected official help make changes nothing comes verbal jabs. sister law UK got twice, yes, can, brother. 🍻 Yeah, that's Sweden summarized. well before, are. Rough start, perhaps? good thing protesters rubbing shoulders. guess thats umbrella tactic used.... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right, two weeks. Neither us predict future bring. least admit things better two months ago?

And admit possibility things get much worse currently are. Texans remember led path COVID control Fall? Producer/Screen writer ... plot even make sense, one going believe this, let's show.

Reality dumber fiction. ""**There’s reason walking around mask**. you’re middle outbreak, wearing mask might make people feel little bit better might even block droplet, it’s providing perfect protection people think is. And, often, unintended consequences — people keep fiddling mask keep touching face."" -- Fauci

&amp;#x200B;

Ba-dum tssssss agree there's still lots chances catch even masks masks still help.

If pre-symptomatic coughing/sneezing, still spread breathing/talking/shouting/singing. That's spreading quickly right now, via people yet know it

And lot evidence masks help that. macro level - comparing countries, regions, etc, high use vs. low use - micro level - ex. two hairstylists Springfield, MO worked 140 customers virus, employers employees wore masks 0 caught virus. trust rich people, say true, say twist it, anything really Nothing may happen them. 

Or something may happen them, addition killing others. 20-something year old woman intubated unconscious dead grandfather young woman going one party. Fabric masks perfectly acceptable helpful general population general settings, long everyone wearing them. requires community effort. knew response weren’t American... must nice Actually know someone personally cases world come tested positive again. learned trust “experts” anymore go actually see actually happening around me. take mine without touching etc.

It's like touching got it. far coming contact handing take real skill do. could something could nothing. Mine c0nsistently shows 94 95. shows 99 wife regularly. DR office, shows 97 98...I chalk variance. also get variance fingers. got mine February baseline figures good....I suspected got COVID March meter read 91 92 couple days....my calibration put 94 so. costs almost nothing eat fried chicken made bigots--there many many alternatives. costs much, much live modern society without electronics clothing, industries basically man rely highly dubious practices. Like, arguing ""there's ethical consumption Capitalism"", agree with; control production availability electronics depend rare metal mining exist, whereas pretty immediate control food eat.  Look, want people respond condescension, misrepresent said. knew creating analogy, also knew comparing reddit church referencing relationship bars churches, inherent characteristics church specifically.

To rest this, mention moderation, point broader that. users self-censoring, well users better job moderating. act, expect others. totally fine expectations places mentioned--and many others, idea acceptable appropriate behavior defined circumstance absolutely controversial daily life--,but bring expectation internet people flimsily claim ""censorship"" 🙄

There reason big subreddits decline time directly related behavior. large enough issue accepted subreddits become trash get big. idea maintaining subreddit quality ""small fish"" again, dismissive. quality subreddit important characteristic, defines shelf life, popularity, activity, etc.

Bringing issue conversation fits exactly proposed definition reddit, looks like open discussion problem. minimum topic jokes, would argue topic types discussion lasting impact. chime question, /u/Governor_DeSantis? sister currently planning wedding next week.

Fuck using whole thing excuse never shake anyone's hand ever again. agree. think really courteous thing do! little absurd expect people symptoms continue post-covid (unless given ANOTHER reason god forbid), become social norm even sniffles. Arm workers. Pepper spray shit anti-maskers. I’m honest, anti-maskers get shot wearing masks, hey, can’t really say that. 16 lbs direction you’d closing 430. you’re solidly 300’s instead. sounds like you’ve got this. (Easter come gone...)

Do realize make sense?

Just answer question eh? Cognitive screening.* even test  2/3 Idaho residents say it’s big deal masks infringe freedoms don’t think read another rehash article again. 

We get it, can’t, people hear “OK WELL MAYBE...” Correct, given masks people using effective N95s respirators, one would still expect transmission travelers, no? would excellent time fall chaos start worshipping Nurgle. saying. try stay Paris sewage system. putting chain link fence hoping stop mosquitoes coming Unhealthy food taste great. Sweets taste great. Getting go work sucks.

Everyone choices. Obesity choice. almost like threw knowledge viruses discovered one! Masks work. Give break. evidence person person transmission obviously was. list goes discussed enough. that's scary stuff. moves fast, cases start pop nursing home, community already. already thought idiots mask thing, another confirmation. teach kindergarten 8th graders.

Just looked found waaaaay better app! adds, paywall, way comprehensive data.

It's called ""Heart Rate Analyzer"" work Samsung phones. New York city hit around 20% number though. US anywhere close I'm sure many places world close. around Dallas Tarrant Counties would say least 80% people see wearing masks. Probably more. around businesses people walking around community. 

I keep seeing comments one Texas wearing masks, huge state, everyone needs stop generalizing. General populations handling better areas others. That's all. ONE worlds best healthcare systems. It’s usually best comes highly specialized treatments surgeries. far normal healthcare everyone deals with, aren’t special. Especially live rural areas low income areas/states.

Problem is, incredibly sorry political system doesn’t act line people want anymore. Yeah, it’s pleasant today. 107 degrees humidity low 66%. completely missing point here. China's border closure effective every single person entering country screened, tested quarantined . Whereas US travel ban China Brazil ineffective exempts US citizens permanent residents. enter US without tested quarantined. 

And Pakistan's outbreak nothing China. index cases Iran, India Europe 300 deaths per day nationwide, covid 2 3 times less serious average flu season, CDC's threshold defined epidemic. let stop claiming sky falling.

*In Southern America, don’t beat virus. Virus beats you.*  “I hate Trump putting wearing masks Trump even Republicans ridiculous.”

You’re wrong things comment, might biggest thing. Trump/Republicans predominately rejected use masks enough evidence shown scientists conclusively establish effective. Politicizing use masks quite literally worst possible thing could done, yet party exactly that? moment, Trump could forceful embracing use masks effort counteract message party already sent out, continues half heartedly so, even call that. inability acknowledge wrong accept semblance responsibility matter doomed US’s chance avoiding death grand scale.

It’s really tiresome see people continue try absolve administration political party continued disaster country’s response this. thought main way virus spreads, still learning virus spreads.

There ya go. like said. Unless think ""not major vector"" ""not main way virus spread"" meaningfully different.

And again. Since clearly missed addressed single also clean surfaces case desks alternate well. (Since likely enough full class) match scale complexity problem response.

There centralized decentralized parts response.

Centralized systems great making large-scale impacts large-scale problems. Decentralized systems great handling local, complex problems.

For example, whether open schools close bars better handled local level, since lot factors go play.

On hand, manufacturing tons masks complex task. requires simple action large scale. That's centralized response comes handy.

Let's pump brakes little bit hyperbole. ""Anders Tegnell says 50 percent population needs immune reach status quo, waves ups downs number infected.       
- think reach level people getting sick get vaccine, says.""

In said : ""Sweden starting see effects herd immunity parts country, says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell."" (April 16, 1,757 deaths Sweden) 50 years playing 3 card monte taxes. We'll give poor middle class small tax cut!!! 2 years, course, goes away. rich? We'll give tax cut well. Billions dollars expiration date.

It free, course. Bill Clinton Barak Obama office raised taxes cut spending deficit quit growing........as quickly. still grew, Republicans accept budget cuts defense (companies) token increases wealthy. soon either afore mentioned Democrat elected deficit DEMOCRATS FAULT phrase 'Tax Spend' repeated ad-nauseam. think something worse, Republicans whenever can: Tax Cut Spend. Look every Republican Nixon look deficit did, look got tax dollars.  quite possible zero COVID deaths. Countries managed it.

Reddit acts high mighty idea physics pandemic. (Probably not, I've previously banned going personal questions, try avoid topic everyone's sake.)

**The corona pandemic hit tourism around world hard, exceptions. Västerbotten, many found new ways holiday tourism even become stronger corona crisis, according researchers Umeå University.**

The restrictions reduce spread coronavirus stopped basic thing hospitality industry - opportunity people move, says Roger Marjavaara, researcher Department Geography Umeå University.

\- spring experiment. seen world without tourism particularly pleasant situation many, says.

But need travel disappear that. People finding new ways tourists positive effects short long term, says.

\- Swedes spend time abroad tourists spend here, means usually outflow consumption. people stay home, good country's tourism industry, says.

Consumption instead find new, corona-safe ways Sweden. Holiday homes, caravans, fishing outdoor life examples tourism boom corona times, sales goods linked exploded, according him.

Västerbotten county lot nature-based tourism therefore good conditions tourism flourish, says Roger Marjavaara.

\- summer, Västerbotten residents discover local area. Destinations usual ones created become widespread form tourism concentrated certain ""hotspot"" places, says.

On hand, believes Umeå worse tourist destination city receives lot income business trips leisure travelers neighboring countries.

\- may retail positively affected, example building materials sector plant trade start garden, says.

However, big challenge hospitality industry pandemic climate change. climate require change travel habits, says Roger Marjavaara. question also raised colleague Dieter Müller debate article published VK.

There great risk many travel ever corona crisis. seen effect before, example Second World War crisis 70s, says Roger Marjavaara.

\- restrictions lifted, like opening dust hatches travel. short term, bad effect climate, says.

But hopeful future believes habits many acquired corona era change travel long run. local destinations discovered tourism eventually take place smaller distances, help stop climate change, says. Everything USA have....  kids’ district Florida giving parents various options. opting teacher-assigned online school day ourselves. taking children school alleged safety precautions. end day know parents drop sick child school leave entire day. selfishness, necessity can’t afford miss work. Covid going spread like wildfire every school. Safety measures going much unfortunately. wonder alternative is? must drugs - tablet based opiates perhaps - administer larger doses normal consequences matter point? Codiene etc. Absolutely terrifying think about:( doctor 100% correct given context. statement response ridiculous claim masks lower blood oxygen levels normal use.

That interpretation context. doctor quantify statement ""normal use""? lies biggest problem pandemic: morons thing understand things better experts dedicated entire lives subject.

The big problem pandemic experts sloppy say public. Take something like mask wearing? CDC discourage mask wearing March April? CDC try explain fear shortages medical staff? CDC not. 

Instead, CDC simply said masks needed unless looking someone infected, infected yourself. mean? Potentially. already 4 endemic coronaviruses humans never eradicated continue infect us. 229e, OC43, NL63, HKU1. LOL, I'm locking ever again.

I'm laughing you. Stay anyway. Can’t risk Damn you, Schrodinger, passing law makes observing illness creates illness first place mean party pooper, wonder Emirates pay passenger dies coronavirus flying them? would imagine liability big part it.

Also, concert sport event you’re potentially sitting next group people couple hours. (Versus somewhat mobile nature demonstrations.) don’t see way enforce mask wearing.

Demonstrators typically wearing masks, even gas masks point. talk many children died COVID-19?

**Just 33 kids age 14 died many kids vaccinated flu. one vaccinated COVID-19. So, comparing apples apples. means flu actually even deadly numbers show. stopping locals going kids baseball games crammed dugouts. live here, too. Filled propane tank yesterday - masked person. Got oil change morning. one building besides one lady mask - none employees gave damn. instances town 15 miles me. 

My little tourist town really good. towns around, much. one hanging anyone outside household unless they're socially distanced and/or wearing mask. sister asking family take pictures violating that. 

Let's assume mom bride asymptomatic. we've got group folks, wearing masks, standing together take multiple pictures. wedding party? ain't quick 5 minute ordeal. think could end? Maybe 3 4 people get mild symptoms. Maybe Gram Gramps dies. Maybe flower girl ends multisystem inflammatory syndrome. Maybe none happens. Would chance killing injuring someone family? sure hell wouldn't. bullshit born ny. NY/NJ friendly ribbing among people area. critiques kinda apply NY well. cannot tell lie Yes, study found masks damn effective. thing I'd afraid face shield viruses stick shield, possibly. know that's thing. seems like could float shield kind get trapped around closer proximity face. wondering creates kind concentrated virus cloud shield. knows.

Of course does. prevailing narrative right US uniquely messing coronavirus response putting world risk.

An extension anti American narrative existed covid. 

That's false narrative prove go along. Yes, numbers reliable even developed western world. people going use numbers attack US, going examine see actually say That's exactly evil genius would say... Sure, dare anyone fix city bring businesses people afford higher rents improve economy look place. let old buildings crumble uninhabitable piles rust rubble. 


I get poor people need housing, leaving buildings rot one else rent way that.  usually warm to-go oven 180degF 10 mins. time 200F going catch it. Fast bandaid, slow bandaid. aren’t. saying ramp testing. Wear masks. Listen Fauci. Geez, didn’t start school September years :O could  Oh cool trick. make sure take advantage People saying it. best people. I'm planning wear masks along face shields. face shield keep hands face especially eyes - I'm bad rubbing eyes resting hands face.

I mainly wanted share experience goggles work wearing masks educators waste money like buying discover issue. think they've said risk transmission via eyes small I'm sure goggles eye protection necessary masks anyway. Also seasonal, GOOD ONE. Go around? No, don't. Sell stocks lose sweet gains since March. mean, also we're arresting people permanently blinding Federal officers laser pointers, still causing destruction Federal property? stated article, used plants, social media video target specific people, detained ID them, safer so.

Or would rather beat mob grab one person?

So, okay stand across street it?

Also, get read rights get detained. charges levied you, get rights read you, handed paper.

Most states detain set amount time, charges levied, conduct investigation. I.e., California hold 72 hours.

Their identification displayed shoulders, along designation patches.

And think Police use unmarked vehicles?

These legitimate tactics use reduce amount violence sides, securing target. Even though evidence shown lockdown better wear masks we'd able get better.

Ok think hoax simply measures? 

I'm certain things others used less insidious government, seen current 
""Proactive"" occupying forces across America, basically feds get ahold means corrupt opinion obviously shown, would that? feds taking obscuring facts pushing business usual seems like would right alley correct?

But things want government intervention somehow patriot acting you, im assuming? Even though already technology able tap moments notice want?

1) Lockdowns pretty much every nation significant outbreak delaying tactics. Test-trace work suppression sustainable months great cost.


2) time goes nations moving towards ""Swedish"" strategy.


They 100% right counts. You’re right, selfish Chinese give money Latin America wants, Latin American countries always stand United States.

Again, welcome quote link sentences paper liked support original statement. I’ve listening reading articles virologists epidemiologists never seen this. sources? That’s terrible, unsurprising given a) assaults healthcare workers ludicrously commonplace even corona b) corona apparently emboldened entitled assholes. 

I hope hospital least back. Could everyone loses someone invite governor service, please? anyone else, need feel human toll getting hundreds requests day (sincere ones) might move needle. evidence new infectious, less severe strain emerged US?

I'm basing massive surge infections last weeks, comparatively slow rise death rates. compared earlier phase pandemic two rose similar rates. (Based data here: factors play better awareness symptoms / better treatments / people getting tested symptoms identified / different demographics getting infected? live outside US less visibility impact medical facilities, seen reporting of. need ship anything!! It’s mostly likely already way whether want not. clue japan works deer. temple part temple. going treat lesser slightly sacred. Unfortunately loudest ones minority this. see constant posts Facebook kids need school. It’s gross nobody cares safety thing I'll say get carried away start victory lap yet. Keep up.  thought whole thing going magically disappear weather got warm. /s think depression informs outlook virus? Like yeah country going shit. it’s before. It’ll after. better worse you’re probably going live. you’ll live done. might depressing part. can’t see problem executive branch deploying federal agents democratic cities **only without request running cities** willfully ignorant. 

That's broader issue. Short term, problem arresting obvious anarchists anarchists proven societally dangerous, like boogaloo bois far right. also problem idea feds saying ""if city adminstration handle it, will"" regards massive spike theft violent crime that's come certain cities city police asked step back effectively stand comes day-to-day duties-- Minneapolis, Chicago, NYC. Spending money education public funding risk communities deter people who're actively destroying communities, particularly comes gun violence-- saying ""all communities need less policing funding sympathy"" really address issue broken, dysfunctional subcultures.

But said, issue sets precedent Trump administration, Trump administration absolutely 100% going abuse federal power regard; see actions already. Trump administration knows going lose November Trump's already made clear multiple ways he's going accept results election loses. School serve daycare function well kids young enough need parents working say. pretend isnt part it. People use yelp figure restaurants actually open, eat indoors without mask. JP Morgan also said data showed people using credit cards dine restaurants predicted COVID surges towns.

It’s population level assessment, individual correlation. Towns people eating restaurants cases soon after. Well appreciate outlook! feel way. thankfully haven’t hit hard quarantine everything. Though work school, we’ll see goes month. it’s special ed too, remotely isn’t really option. 

In case, I’m always positive person keeps low profile, whatever happens happens. Could dead week, let’s enjoy today. 

But yeah- it’s real fucked situation politically-speaking. Trying let much get me. appreciate way replied, thank kind!  three pounds case :)

Edit: 1 ounce leftover cures idea, probably can't. know mine off, phone reliable read 50$ oxmeter.

You're right, epidemiologist, unlike you, better understanding what's going covid. virus spreading northeast testing thing, yet somehow, NY reached 400K cases, NJ right behind them. took 5 months California finally pass NY \*\*confirmed\*\* cases, eventually . one state (NY) tests 23,000 people day gets 10K results, another state (California) tests 120K day gets amount cases, one better? Way prove awful NJ/NY handled things.

And besides happening China, Italy, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain, NJ way knowing going on, especially putting covid infected patients nursing homes, accounts 1 12 deaths nursing home residents state. Great job Murphy!

Gotta love looked first post account made assumption everything post/comment/view, age lol. Thank demonstrating people sub form opinions first thing see ignorant look full picture! Told boss. use exit Well... Canada. UK. Australia. Germany. Poland...

But countries away kind systemic stupidity, less power (although god help UK, they’re certainly giving go)

Edit; salty brits forgetting elected low-carb Tr0mp voted island EU immigrants lol every time see Reddit banner saying visit sub “stay safe informed”. According who? You? would rather someone near coughing sneezing fit bandana vs sealed n95 valve, think crazy.  also happens island small population see tens millions tourists, geographically isolated, entry points easy seal... keep going back thinking governors politicians tried war crimes over. really forgot Abe government somewhat short sighted. Instead thinking cant hide forever due nature virus.


The fuck still use fax time??I knew Corp use it,but email? Internet ain't issue Japan. Use amazon browse products try find website seller. Amazon largely distribution company. Calling “strategy” laughable. equivalent making eye contact dog child know it’s going require get seat. rest world apparently stupid Americans? also internet news. sound like twat starting every question that. Let try de-load questions:

""Why almost hospitals empty?"" (Are they? cite)

""Why covid positive people shoved old folks homes?"" (are they? cite)

""Why nothing done discourage rioting protesting last months?"" (I really see connection one)

""why told wear masks? Apparently face covering do, people could using fabric masks since day 1 supposedly saving thousands lives"" (I'm one. Fuck whoever said otherwise.) Virtually every country responded well strong central government leadership, New Zealand, Vietnam, China, Singapore, Finland... see big deal is. piss customer can't come without mask return gun... well plenty fire extinguishers deal them. Nara Park. tranquil. You’re right. fucking chance hell hole America. agree. Need Brown Round screaming fucks submission. Foo moa yeers REEE 10k, great, terrible.  Brain smooth could ball bearing. yeah, exist research ready prime time yet Thanks, English mother language. remember next time. New nick Fauci: ""Dr. Obvious"". good sense. absolute tragedy able bring virus control lock down. lock wasted opened early, without adequate preparation like testing contact tracing. 

We know responsible tragedy, pointing fingers gets post removed bot. change facts, tho. know whose fault is. Full lockdowns needed want death rate higher neighboring countries locked down, that's correct. There’s actually pretty simple math this. 

7 day average deaths/day peaked around 2,200 April. 

Estimated IFR 0.5%-1%.

That would mean point weeks prior, 220,000-440,000 new infections day. 

Maybe bit less overwhelmed hospitals widespread prevalence nursing homes would raise IFR, ballpark numbers would suggest new infections/day easily 100k back then. sure! 100% agree. meant was, people erroneously pull valid precept twist manipulate applying another purpose. concepts like ""personal responsibility"" whch dont really espouse.  Correct.

The freezer hold 50 bodies. Currently 200 trucks Texas reason.

It's temporary mortuary. 

Worst part lost friends, families told cause death pnumonia. look average deaths last 10 years compared year suspect real numbers much higher. child wouldn’t behave way! /s 

I’m teacher, too, haven’t seen re-opening plan yet isn’t absolutely fucked. Another article: 
 Super Sentai Sexytime werid... say consensus. sensible.

I said Virologists Epidemiologists telling people get infected fast possible. 

My country entire month told scientists government freaked ordered stop saying that. 

People started lick fingers outside, people coughed candy giving kids kinds weird s***. never anything completely slander said stuff expected people states understood effect would religious communities used diving headlong beliefs, told something like that.

One redditor told get infected die mentioning it, truth told, big consequences scientists come publicly saying stuff like that. No, wanted attention posting it, posting now. therapist easy assessment. Aw, make personal 
when ran argument. you? Rightfully so.  read article (without signing up.)

I think people try long can. Owning house, space, ground floor bathroom, elderly parent healthy enough left alone day work, things would help delay need skilled nursing facility. 

If family member cannot left alone difficult choice. Also Alzheimer's punch face, wander, that's hard. forget can't stairs get around barricade take spill 8th time pretty rough. think people really best, burden often (not always) falls unequally first born daughters.


I really feel sandwich generation, reason part kids.  nothing deer hunter wants quick kill too. Nothing like tracking blood trail that's Marshy area, really wooded area, really hilly area. Usually three bad deer die, better population level since fewer deer die slowly. x% culling vs letting population double starving death, wrecking local ecosystems process. population level humane. Maybe even humane solution would involve mass sterilization end killing deer, good luck getting anybody pay usually see deer pets. problem though everyone wearing masks masks offer protection people wearer unless we're talking properly fitted N95 similar. However, even N95 still attend event knew one going wear masks.  CAN'T FOOL US BILL. AGAIN. reminds one favorite hijinks boot camp. Since cut snail mail communicate outside world, super easy start celebrity death rumors. So, full lockdowns necessarily needed then. Like epidemiologists post claimed...

By way, live Sweden. parks, beaches, trains, buses public spaces like supermarkets crowded people wearing face masks social distancing. still cases keep dropping...

So, seems lockdowns face masks indeed key factor keeping spread manageable. something else. Texans remember Alamo Fair point. feel country least people take vaccine, initially don’t eventually scared it. sure America though... Rona DeathSentence nice ring well.  pissed government school boards hold teachers accountable online learning last year. 

If done somewhat effectively would ok closing schools. current hurting kids. Link image above-mentioned reference thingy.  complain MN get 3 days. Considering antibody percentages coming Florida Arizona, tend disagree. states struggling testing like north east was, probably bad still going miss asymptomatic folks outside random testing folks symptoms. sure what's giving impression general consensus Austin liberal area Texas. Austin much less populous relative Houston Dallas, look percentage basis almost identical. Initially, issues. four walls, roof, beds, even dividers.

Staff run machines actually keep people alive different story.

Still, fact infected actually quarantined huge effect controlling spread, given pop density Wuhan stupidly essential. mean ""against traditional family structure"" get benefit *looking* like care also benefit still getting business people refuse wear them. piece land. Nobody responsibility it. Patriotism toxic bullshit, especially country like this. Apathy entirely understandable point given supposed leadership unilaterally failed us. never chance

Because we're fight war two fronts: Covid &amp; Trump. One thing figured racists is, racists they’re surrounded by, less consider themself racist  Chick-fil-A even taste good. We're also letting around shit. chance, they'd eat kids. Fuck wolves! know crazy thought, imagine need enforce people willingly chose care lives others *just wore damn masks!!* Home depot better. Flu drop significantly, earlier usual. “Even Americans” lol. guess deserve Yup, it’s pretty defeatist mentality group “winners”. ones heads asses? We're back measuring deaths 9/11 units again.

At least back April excuse know dealing (the month two before) hit NYC really fast hard.

Now we're killing 1,000 people day everyone needs get drunk bar they're real Americans. No, vaccine already tested outbreak Xinfadi (the Beijing outbreak) D614G mutation found effective original Wuhan inactivated vaccine developed cover strains coronavirus detected far, including virus strains tracked Xinfadi market Beijing,"" Yang Xiaoming, president China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), noted response public concerns vaccine R&amp;D process would ineffective virus mutates. I'm sorry loss :( USA USA USA!!!! 

Seriously we’re destroying competition! Woooooooo. Nobody top numbers! actually 8 states/territories unemployment rate 326$ month. additional 8 states unemployment rate 326$ less 399$. 

Here's site unemployment rate caps state: Funny right would think state would take seriously other, Florida that. see CDC website, tons articles it, Fauci openly stated deaths severely reported. people die many years life left anyways, bioethics standard consider this.

Holy fuck dude..... fuck benefits lying death rates high

Are dense trying mislead people? 

Lot's people benefit high death rate. media benefits gets people watching. Anyone running incumbent November benefits blame them. people investing pharma know vaccine big pay off. 

It take much imagination consider this.  Again, operating assumption hospitals receive treat covid patients prior death. receive autopsy cause death apparent. person found dead home without obvious cause, typically taken county (or local government) medical center examination. cases I'm referring to. 

These individuals fallen normal coronavirus count never treated healthcare facility. Instead, covid determined fact added growing list victims. way, declaring deaths covid allowing state receive money.

I mean make sound like conspiracy. prevelant people think, happen.



To reiterate:

Someone dies home - - - - - taken medical center - - - - cause death determined covid - - - - number infected individuals goes Fewer people saying every month it’s settled science like Obama told us?

Yeah man, totally one looking fight. I'm honestly gonna give you. sounds utterly terrifying I'm sorry :( Cases deaths percentage whole.

Cases saw 2.5% increase prior week's increase 6/30. Deaths saw 1% increase prior week 7/14 (the first increase since start). 

Cases 7/7 saw 0.2% increase week week. Deaths saw 0.3% increase week week week.

The next week saw 3% jump cases. We'lll see happens, looking like larger increase, since Tuesday Wednesday saw 20% increase last week.

7 day trending daily deaths went 516 862 17 days.

It literally took week ""deaths decreasing"" stop continuing trend. people seething, proving wrong lmao I'm Alabama probably 50% people know conceal carry. common here. downvoting news story posted show stupidity going Tennessee, yet another post gave hundreds upvotes mentioning it. county home first 6 weeks can't believe went high school many people disagree this. wasnt sending children regardless. county made easier me. USA #1?? Home Depot same. Hope third option. take mask wearing serious am.

Honestly biggest issue people vacations state people coming state fucked. Locals taking serious. way optimistic? I'm trying sarcastic, I'm curious mean.  Yup. predictable. Nearly everyone wearing mask city months, everyone making big deal small minority wear masks. punished like children now? get law over-enforced toothless, mean can't abused enforced all. really case bother all. Although illegal turn away patients ER without means pay, certainly allocate subpar services medicaid/medicare/no insurance compared private insurers. 

I overheard attending physician discussing uninsured elderly Mexican woman going get medical student look dying. also got minimal nursing care (bathroom day, showers) minimal testing (no MRI, blood work, etc). Needless say, make it. Ok well relatively “normal” compared things full lockdown lol. I’m content currently ""I great lunch today obviously world hunger hoax. there's food fridge starving kids Ethiopia?"" thinking china good aren't. take advantage poor countries debt cant repay take resources collateral something advantageous them. Ive worn one every working day since March least 8 hrs per day. arms legs fallen off. cannot taste smell. tongue one eyeball fell out. carry around ziploc bag. 4 types cancer leprosy etc etc. note doctor. (first part true, rest little sarcastic) Thank friend contributing herd immunity. dumb move, choice. Us breaking records every Christian parent finding Marilyn Manson CD kids room 1999 Boston won’t forget this. Seeing Patriots plane loading masks China feds seized here... people angry. don’t know trump gained lost much ground already here, trump folks seem unwilling admit mistake - nonpolitical centrist suburban folks normally disengaged deeply pissed. Come host rally here, Trump.  statement already proven false. Texas 1,088 ICU beds available hospital may full others not. adverse effects serious cases scary enough--severely compromised lung function, kidney injury requiring dialysis, neurological damage including strokes, seizures, loss smell, etc. still idea what, any, long-term damage expect virus even mildest cases. fiancé hits 100 mine hit 96. 3 ft seems little close. Maybe call health department county? would definitely least wear n95 level mask. difficult dealing co-workers cause many get next you, wear masks, etc, battle getting co-workers respect distance, I've heard successful stories co-workers realize taking seriously firmly make things clear, respect distance least aware. air conditioning worrisome. Terrible situation though :/ let enough people die, eventually enough people get sick. claim like fucker competition bigger asshat Trump. care money life. continues look like April United States, death toll novel coronavirus reaching 1,000 fatalities second day row cases continue surge across much South Western parts country.
According the COVID-19 tracker maintained Johns Hopkins University, 71,695 new cases 1,195 deaths recorded yesterday, raising national total 4,007,859 cases 143,846 deaths today. It’s churches get ya US, compliance basic hygiene practices trust authorities nearly 0%.

The ""and"" sentence important.  US, compliance basic hygiene nearly 100%. But, trust authorities flat 0%.

That complete, total, absence trust, well earned.  US, numerous authorities shown, time again, place personal profit anything else. Even, results deaths thousands people. Makes sense. actually care employees there. people kind belittle success smaller countries lower population... change countries handled virus. Yelp... forget last time used service ... desperation town visiting ... 4.7 rated restaurant ... served me, swear mama's grave ... hamburger helper ... Hurry, hurry Mitch dips hands cookie jar!  far 2a concerned clear statistical connection strength gun laws deaths per 100000. Stronger gun laws, fewer deaths.

Well, yes, stronger car laws = fewer deaths, stronger pool laws = fewer deaths.

In fact, many laws firearms like rifles kill less hammers, yet handguns majority issue?

Also, emphasis laws unconstitutional, amend constitution, legally, right now, every gun law violation 2nd infringement. mask debate shown us guns somehow symbol freedom. ability buy guns designed hunting optimized kill humans needed freedom peoples mind.

Do honestly think guns designed kil lhumans animals?

Do realize humans animals guns designed send round downrange, point, vast majority yelling screaming guns guns bad killing quickly. 

There reason illegal hunt deer AR chambered 5.56. round fast small, chances quick relatively human death low. fact, popular rifle chambering tells lot good for. number threats jokes read Reddit alone guns used liberals frightening.

Well question then: what's seasonal it? virus raging every single country whether summer winter.. freaking pandemic. One Third Texans members Branch Covidians Sounds like job Buffy. seasonal, good season. don’t want friends anymore. 🤣 exactly zero people United States caught October/November, flatearth/faked-moonlanding-level conspiracy theory. 60% like multiple organ failure levels. I’m saying either. certainly link isn’t complete picture. solidifies claim ugly eventually remembered. news. Everyone who's keeping track COVID US expecting long time. Every state US reach 20% immunity levels R0 drop 1.0 hospitals longer risk becoming overwhelmed. point pandemic pretty much over. People still get sick die, longer threaten healthcare system. like Japan socially responsible please? many kids die sink peoples heads? I've lost 5 loved ones COVID-19 including 2 family members. 🙏 wear mask gloves proudly sanitize however wish pain family suffered anyone else.

When people let kids run around unmasked touching everything unsupervised potential death sentence anyone come contact themselves. 💀 treasure kids, protect them. Ask anyone lost child, cost kid back putting mask hours washing hands more, they'd pay heartbeat. ❤ headline say nearly half American polled (1059 people) think school reopen *major adjustments* Yeah, trump mostly mentions Denmark talks opening schools. knows people think virus democratic hoax talk rest us ain't listening, reminding people herd immunity nonsense comes science pples church communities themselves. aware stumbled militant atheist gathering interested anti-theist slander neighbours. always confused someone immigrated Canada Asian country. many old folks homes North America?

Yet MF-ing governor DGAF 5000+ Floridians dead, sleeps fine. Yes. demeanor general towards covid changed last couple days. likely reelection issues, gotta take get crazy man.  excuse desantis using? Wearing mask literally LEAST help friends, neighbors countrymen. people selfish? miss leadership first thing list?

Have seen opiod crisis? force Mitch McTurtle forced lockdown house fucks good. bonkers lol Ffs nursing homes run profit businesses. Yes, finally get people fence wearing masks. point is, masks valves, flaw vs valved n95 may still MUCH better protection cloth mask. Air comes masks. valves sealed push air DOWN.

Hmm. really can’t put finger it. don’t seem news articles written old sick people dying. 

Could... maybe children aren’t likely die sars-cov2, one die, gets reported news due sheer absurdity happening? Maybe??? Lol, nah. Earlier week got email saying another student class back January died.  say neither obit found online.  Since healthy then, going assume. Trump knows stuff called experts. Got email local healthcare provider saying exceeding rate availability quick result tests. great cases spike. Amazed unprepared. Still. know, recently started season 2 show.

Oddly enough, less cautious around people likely become infected virus spreads among humans. think pretty clear fucking idea hypocritical means.

Lol seeing flair give good laugh fair Jesus, get grip. make argument one way other. comment agree worldview, I'm licking balls asshole? bad Tucker Carlson. feel sorry can't imagine losing parents time! remember told years ago can't afford travel insurance, can't afford travel.

Now, it's: fragile wear mask, fragile fly metal tube though stratosphere. can't achieve herd immunity ~10% people antibodies, make sense all. thing, IF, WHEN. epidemics/pandemics future. antibiotics become less less effective bacteria becoming resistant, viruses continue mutate virulent forms. nature's way. real knowledge subject. hear, even start vaccine works, still take year testing start giving public Blame DeSantis Devil need know comes time vote. lose loved one feeling suicidal, take lying asshole instead. Sweden, Vietnam, South Korea probably biggest success stories. Kemp probably worst.

DeSantis audacious terrible but... wow.  agree mask hurt, $2000 fine wearing outdoors makes sense. 6-12 months household expenses. written budget mandatory know total household expenses. Tax breaks also cheaper labor outside CA. would appear seated first class section (looks like kind CRJ) things bit lax, also entitled carry-on ans personal item, appears one extra personal item probably still fits seat. Also flights full there's even less enforcement.

But want tell really people living here, citizens take priority everyone else, especially cant anything anyone else directly vote people pass legislation regarding kind stuff.

The bottom line is- care fellow citizens citizen country x? Yes. Im ashamed say either feel guilt.

Does mean dont care fellow global humans all? No, absolutely not, course do, little money energy effect things problems home lot attention right, it. trying highlight flights stopped within leaving USA, despite number positive cases.

How process you. I'm cool either way. 

For record, I'm anti-american like lot people really, genuinely, want need virus defeated there.

On top lot communities gone voluntary lock down. restrictions get eased going see cases that’s reality it. take positive twist least know breaks contained colonies. nice see articles finally coming actually talk full immune response, typical 'o muh god, antibodies vanishing 3 months' paranoia. know anything certain, likely body create necessary T-cells B-cells antibodies fade get re-infected, immune system able respond quickly virus. see problem.

If person autism, might harder convince wear mask keep sensory sensitivities. literally feature autism would make wearing mask UNSAFE.

Sadly even still probably hear people downplaying throughout US. satisfying see conspiracy theory disproven reality, ngl... take advice...to take advice? Man must hard find hats. least outdoors. say nothing presymptomatic / asymptomatic. There's incentive people get tested.

Of course actual infection numbers far exceed daily confirmed cases. Good news stock price though, going now. actually, majority adult americans multiple risk factors obesity, hypertension, etc. puts lot population higher risk complication would imagine. medical background? huge issue many reasons aside number deaths:

-deaths dont account amount ended icu long term complications
-hospitals overwhelmed means poorer care every patient, covid positive not
-financial burden increased hospitalizations
-time missed work school due feeling like crap
-emerging long term issues even mild cases

^and thats name few. urge consider continuing research learn. Doctors public health officials worried reason. FYI, bc somebody old doesnt mean okay died this. lost years still terrible consequence. originally got interview english ([in case still ), however slightly different focus also explained current one already over? missed something?

Do think term ""herd immunity"" brought table bakery student? 

Both Sweden UK officially tried spread herd immunity getting infected faster although UK forced change strategy. country (where strategy completely different) cadre virologists epidemiologists still came media said get infected faster, much faster. Trump mention country's remarkable success promoting school openings US know going around you, super busy militant atheist forgot notice term herd immunity comes from. That's okay, go back meltdown now🤘 no. 

it's still ""only"" 4 million 330 million.

and think news ""they got it"" .. nothing... died.

they wait Tom Hanks Rita Wilson get better story broke.

Yupp totally agreed. aboslutely right ""IN SHORT TERM"" go back normal worried many people seem thik NEVER go back normal (which title suggests ) absolutely nonesne course. 

WHO massively lost credibility opinion making claims, way handled pandemic would rather take opinions experts universities , independent oraganziations etc rather  trusting word , tell truth. 

When look comments seems like people (execpt ) also seem think never go back normal posted comment. semms lot fo people misinformed unfortunately.

Yupp. whether achieve herd immunity vaccinations infection eventually reach certain percentage immune people population pandemic cease exist eventually since simple wont enough suceptible people around virus infect.

Thanks again.

Take care :) people hate masks much?

The bad part masks smell breath. brush teeth put one on. People dying disease. also dying hospitals full many treatments deferred. DeSantis seems inherited president orange buffoon mentality. rural Americans paying attention crisis back then. Oh, look.

Literal fucking death pane!s. many businesses shutting down. Guess can't save six months expenses emergencies either. well people risk spread people point? like, really risk taking necessary precautions self isolating? Another way asking could be, **Who** spread to?

take instance couple going beach. people could potentially spread Covid (assuming actually Covid begin with) people beach? understand maybe make stops store something along way, overall, major risk spreading disease would others going beach well.

Are mainly concerned stop *grocery store* way beach? need go grocery store, higher percentage chance coming contact Covid b/c there? 

 seems weird shun people beach desire go beach over. concerned hear checked article reference article. First off, seem legitimate source information (I googled blog two articles popped ""hate sight"" Washington Post antisemitic Atlantic). 

Even reporting halting work ""field hospital"" days ago looks like small barn roof permitted.  anyone tried building field hospital US permits major intersection would go?  That's far cry ""destroys COVID-19 testing clinic""

Ok, well also list statistics ignored due gut feeling, exact blend internet comment satisfy lofty standards? Aus trying delay inevitable don’t envy nursing home directors. easy decisions make.

I imagine isn’t easy position choose locking nursing home down, banning visitors, knowing full well mean slipping standards care many die alone. median amount time patient spends nursing home death 5 months. Imagine less 5 months live, could told would never see loved ones again, would lower chance getting virus 1 20 chance killing you. would feel that? easy decision nursing home director make. 

My sister works locked one says absolute misery there. Family can’t help care like usually do, volunteers aren’t allowed help minimize chance comes in. conditions, impossible give standard care used to, knowing full well don’t anything live anymore, since activities visits cancelled, many patients don’t even get bed anymore, languishing rest lives away lonely bed. easy decision make.

The highest risk also negatively effected shutdowns. feel like unfair governor. blame sure, could've prevented long got here. Blame Trump, blame WHO, blame every mother fucker refuses follow simple instructions like wear mask use common sense. There's plenty blame go around fall feet. Hell, woman might've even brought home maybe partially blame know. know governor complete piece shit, he's one blood hands. 1/100,000 kids 10 dies whatever say 1/10,000 gets serious symptoms see concern hiding away.

Nowadays parents old lazy enough try take neck shots - either hit spine deer drops like bag rocks, bullet goes high leaves deer unharmed. can't breathe whilst wearing mask, I'm sure they'll issues breathing covid Honestly, heard guy years Tiger King came I'm sure made take Oklahoma seriously definitely made wary. instead simple requests right thing community, get actual laws real enforcement mechanisms. 

Which reasons plenty laws history. society wants something without needing force minority refuses, laws/rules created. code rules like that. Look laws fining people wearing seatbelt example. legit expert said masks harmful? 

and weird gather data evidence, science changes. therefore experts opinion changes. imagine? awful advice. Pretty sure known covid capable this.

Still sorry loss.  made burst laughing bad day, thank problems see CDC study order perceived severity:

1. Data mostly March/April, testing woefully inadequate. We're lot better testing now, expect current ratio Actually Infected people Positive Tests less 10:1 now.
2. data representative sample population. convenience sample people seeking healthcare lock down, even representative people normally seek healthcare. BTW, people seek healthcare tend older, female, sick general population.
3. data collected 10 sites. MSM press coverage seems generalizing sites entire US population. I'm demographer, seems inappropriate.
4. low prevalence sites, heavily influenced sensitivity/specificity test (i.e. Utah)

The 10 infections every positive test **right now** narrative gross misrepresentation study presented.

The title paper accurate, MSM headlines terrible:

Seroprevalence Antibodies SARS-CoV-2 10 Sites United States, March 23-May 12, 2020

An honest headline study would be: CDC estimates 6-24 infections every positive test April 10 places using non-representative data. Man don’t need fucking article tell this. fucking shit limit human interaction virus fucking spread less/die out. People don’t understand need locked cages. Thaaaaaat’s someone trying chip vaccine would say!!!!!!!!!! Oh! fuck!! Tin foil hat fell! need protect meself 5G controlled Bats!! (/s case Reddit) headline could also 'One third Texans still taking coronavirus seriously.'    thank you! there’s many things we’re allowed say try get customer put damn mask on. hold together stay polite there’s literal germ-spewing, mouth-breathing neanderthal refusing put mask “mY riGHtS” difficult say least.

but another customer say anything want maskholes. please, continue shame them. hope make feel like lowliest piece shit disgustingly selfish are. you’re god’s work remember Tom Hanks reported diagnosed. Idris.

That’s good perspective though. 4/300  100%, push single voter issues like abortion gun rights damn hard. similarly always cater specific relegion. late whole rhetoric anti-other pro-our beliefes.

Because people vote actually look beyond things they'd realize much people voted fucking average individual. Wal mart, noticed dude got front entrance removed mask that's second time see stunt pulled Wait, what? locked mid/late March, masks required. going phased reopening, we've well. There's people claiming Connecticut lock all? US doomed fail start point run Tylenol. guy gets (: issue is, 70 percent. Theres additional unemployment fundage (from read: could wrong). some, aint lot. I'm talking Walgreens confidence would mean went ship. Wait warm weather going cure virus. Haha Haha. Dumbass.  Testing times helpful either. test done CA Monday told results 10-14 days. sure much good do.....doc said is. tracking website given ""track test"" even show took test yet. Crazy. expand point: people already required wear pants don’t hear anyone complaining it. imagine now, “How supposed go bathroom I’m forced cover restrictive pants! form social control!” Pam showing Michael 3 pictures asking spot difference.jpg Gotta start walking carrying bell make sure get effect. I've talked several grandparents strongly favor opening schools restrictions, mentioned kids (the students' parents, is) opposed it. Lines voting trends general mask trends (older white = likely Republican, Republican = likely anti-mask). they'd answer ""yes"" issue, they're also least affected it.

I wonder respondents break terms actually school-aged children, school employee, etc. work Rio Grande Valley tweet isolated incident widespread? awful. :( pass, families, friend experience day day out. listening guy hung rapist pedo? we’ve knowing this. recommend keep rooms around 70-75 degrees there’s lot outside traffic.

this also quite outbreaks meat plants.

viruses love cold air. reddest states ones exploding Covid. president thinks it’s magically disappear it’s conspiracy torpedo election. all, I’d like know country residence political leanings see we’re conversation.

Also look truth Super sad town raised in. listening guy hung rapist pedo?  possible 😂. good idea. ferry runs months. there’s getting island least half year unless go commercial airplane. cannot hop boat head nearest medical facilities. Yes, example, perhaps ""probably bad"" means 9.9x instead 10x. think really hard say, moving forward. Good point, won’t see Exhales burp stupid Apparently every competent country centralized leadership handle situation, yet US (the ""greatest"" country world), seems impossible.

We know competent centralized systems institutions work.  “Well, show Samsung Nike actively funds groups hate specific group people ill consider stopping buying products.

You draw moral line somewhere thats draw line”


You don’t like Chick-Fil-A gay rights. That’s fine. 

But essentially say, “slave labor child trafficking? Meh, live that. Get back don’t stand gay rights.” That’s pretty hypocritical. think virus gives shit politics? Treatment plans, procedures, CPT codes match corresponding ICD10 diagnosis claim paid out. 

Hospitals billing CPT codes patients die put primary diagnosis (and cause death) Covid want extra 20% per cares act. yes whether patient lives dies put Covid primary diagnosis (icd10).

They cause death match icd10 code link procedures get paid for. It’s smart really. Insurance companies don’t really pay much medical procedures though moral. 

Pretend crashed car (your fault) drunk driver. found driver drunk. Would seize opportunity say drivers fault since it’s established drunk even though it’s fault accident happened. would get better payout insurance coverage one would wiser.  dumb title. 8% becomes 1 10. least say closest numeric digit without going 1/12 wildly uneducated virus, intentionally lying?

I’m sure worse. going then? may seem crazy county million people pretty good local taxes income...

The state provides $8,000 per student per year.

Florida state provides $19,000 per inmate prison per year. Ha. Good Lord man sounded little high ASH known bending truth looked press release: online survey 10,000 people (to fair, pretty big sample) calculated whole population, possibly inaccurate. Also, say judge 'quitter', someone smoked couple days, week, month? 

Good news people quitting, I'd take million estimate pinch salt. testing adequate number people able back current number following number total positive tests. see reaching 1,500 soon  positive news take away Sweden avoided harms lockdown. That's big. Forget covid, dancers better worry carbon monoxide poisoning. kills lot quicker. Guidelines say children 2 wearing masks. literally depend everyone around follow rules.


But also, flying small child right kinda good idea, opinion, soooo appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* state. county hit hard first recently seen small bump, tiny compared state whole.

Really?

WHAT??? odds U.S. actually ends first wave vaccine available everyone? Immediate ejection gets live rest life knowing killed grandpa selfish skip damn party.

this LITERALLY people warning would happen. exact fuckin' thing. worth it? worth grandpa go ONE party?

Edit: something could easily missed read headline: Ms. Party thang *herself* hooked ventilator medically induced coma ICU 10 days. She’s 20-something Rona surely fucked up, too, grandparents. wins dead grandpa, grandma still ICU, potential medical bankrupty 30, possible lifetime organ damage, one party. even skipped visit spared poor grandparents, still fucked going party. might first post sub ever make laugh. let’s get back business folks. facts life can’t give fears stop living. need live responsibly. Im really hoping currently seeing less lethal, mutated coronavirus atm. Time tell next weeks though delay cases:deaths...  Many people saying even want shut all. Hard say: know bunch people covid zero issues (in fact many zero issues didn’t realize ever it). downplaying it: also knew people died one person covid linger two months, seems minority accidentally vented HR rep day called hear COVID results.

I said frustrating asked come office, every week, global pandemic.

My HR told me: ""we're cleaning, etc, I'm happy address specific concerns may have.""

Me: ""how forced work office global pandemic specific concern?"" sure state talking schools legal option reject personal objection religious exception seen anything yet. 

Of closed cases (dead recovered) US 7% mortality rate. 

So, means 60-70,000 new cases day happening now, point future, 4200-4900 deaths day. Well that’s charming thought...

;) Except lot people continuing die... Might want start locking door. peaked SHUT DOWN, we're wide open peaking. 

So even shut tomorrow, still another 2-3 weeks rising infections deaths. heavy smoker, i'd love know secret is. Perhaps British people willpower me, i've quit opioid painkillers, amphetamines, cocaine without medical assistance. 

I've tried nicotine gum, lozenges, disposable e-cigs, nicotine inhalers, Juul, even blew $150 vape rig. None even came close replacing cigarettes me. 

The thing think might work non-tobacco cigarettes, i'd amount lung damage way less reward. (Plus, non-tobacco smokes i've tried around smelled tasted like actual shit.) Finally. took long. Ebola pretty gnarly tho... Exactly think whenever see that. 180 days jail... wear god damn mask people! Second day row 20% growth prior week. get third like probably pretty safe say entering new rapid growth phase deaths.

Last week starting look like tease slower growth rate :/. can't even get adults America.  provide references illegal claim? state federal law? trial set precedent? No, Coco huge first released 2017 they're hoping draw people back out:  It’s well documented shitty big pharmaceutical companies recent history; however, seem really stepping pandemic.

Let’s continue hope right. 13.5 hours Arizona heat outside COVid station... it’s 110 degrees N95 another mask top, googles, face shield, full body suits. Yet, survive... align capacity restrictions designated Gov. Greg Abbott earlier month, Del Conte said seating Darrell K. Royal - Texas Memorial Stadium reduced 50% facilitate social distancing, meaning around 50,000 Longhorns could potentially seated stands next decision comes heels outbreak among student athletes shortly arrived campus begin voluntary summer workouts. school also reported first death, staff member, earlier month. 500 COVID-19 cases UT-Austin since March, according school's officials pushed forward kicking football season planned. Earlier month, Del Conte said annual game Longhorns Oklahoma Sooners would continue, even organizers canceled State Fair Texas, held weekend close proximity. agree. confused speaking I've mentioned. Nothing ""safer,"" ""slightly less potentially deadly."" 

That keeps level seriousness needs be. logistics supplies. get away saying word sub Well I'll damned. course fucking Florida. Florida Man gonna Florida Man.  Black Death series, mentioned children survived initial pandemic 1347-1348, became parents 15-20yrs later. However plague returned time, children we're hardest hit. mystery why? bacteria mutate? People like disgrace. store unmasked people safe place shop. It’s really crazy people used smoke anywhere, even hospitals. used work oncology, would many lung cancer patients never-smokers, spouse parents smoked house car. lower smoking rates HPV vaccine, I’m hoping see way lower cancer rates next 20 years so. would thought 13 people pickup truck would good way spread Coronavirus? Sold stock late Feb. Retirement account several hundred thousands. Granted, bought dip rational world market would still 40+%. Theres 70,000 cases today we'll open schools shut 14 days theres 1 case...

Yeah...its far simple. Let guess fans allowed Florida excuses less less accepted.thankfully banks anti vaxxers seems growing implemented policy. Say now? Doubt look like war zones. used want fit in. want loser without job. increasingly wish could set work fire menace bum. Even attempt second lockdown, would unenforceable likely wouldn’t followed people. next excuse mandatory shelter place 50 states control may get. excuse be, could really known would get bad? really wish debate you. arguing based assumption person's blood clots caused covid may may case. use extreme example, person 600lb clogged arteries, doubt answer would straightforward. 

Your point essentially person asymptomatic covid heart attack, would premature definitively rule Covid cause. agree completely. I'm saying though, hospitals exploit ambiguity rule cause death definitively covid. may solicit money state, may influx actual Covid deaths caused fall behind there's pressure catch up.  guessing they'll pull 'They're wrong classifying deaths covid' bag

Again  Even then, think they'd concerned shutdown deaths suicides, hypothetically speaking  tested positive, going expose everyone gym tomorrow? fucking arrested -- probably could be. EDIT: Oh -- saw wrote somewhere else symptoms went away 1 week ago -- case know find health authorities doctor going gym. believe fact Dr Fauci, claim discredited. find source return

However: everything short essay true important. powerful piece. anything think opposite happening. looked stats pneumonia average 120k-138k year past 10 years. highest death count pneumonia 138k 2013, reached -- float around 120k-130k range mostly. year already 135k pneumonia deaths july. exact response buddy thought exaggerating numbers using benefit. Like dude destroying economy benefit rich powerful. Long term maybe ways benefit crushing small businesses letting larger ones consolidate major economy shit shows like this. think that's unrealistic though almost everyone would prefer happen world year ago. Nebraska too, yaaay Oh see. Medicare rules makes sense financially. Medicare pays little compared actual cost procedure, whereas Medicaid pays cost. Consider happens patients suddenly transition Medicare COVID targets old people. hospital would serious financial distress; longer getting paid commerical reimbursement rates, 1.2x-1.5x higher. guess rule meant soften blow hospitals financially strapped. may create perverse incentives re-classify patients COVID, also think major issue non-COVID Medicare patients avoiding hospitals high risk get infected Hey, underestimate healing power rabbit secretions! /s Entire groups animals getting wiped diseases part life well. Humans supposed use intelligence communication skills lessen disease burden. blindly ignore medical advances death happen naturally. Literally first section linked said reduction blood oxygen levels could due operational stress. study says ""might"" something mask. Well 20% colds caused coronavirus. would make things 1000Xs worse. 😬🤷‍♂️ Wtf man wasnt. masks known work since human human transmission thing. literally everyone wuhan wearing one. dont need 3 month long study know mask stop breathing shit in. hard figure out. Yea poor journalism sure. thought comments fb bad, Twitter, god, Instagram horrible. like gave worst FB crack let loose Instagram. Sweden, yeah,most swedish people will. US, youll get spit asking. anything, statisticians rolling eyes celebrating statistics yet correct. species literally stupid live.  desperately weak. think civilian owning tank matters military tanks, ships, planes, gunships, bombs, missiles, infantry, artillery, surveillance?

Give fucking break.

Our guns mean shit besides making us feel like stand chance. good environment. Greta proud.  Possibly lots people lurk see someone post story paranoid symptoms extremely low risk encounter. someone either rude dismissive tells logical argument fine. rude helps one, answering response way normalizes people thinking best way handle fears posting reddit helpful. perpetuates anxious people anxious, makes people paranoid. 

It makes wonder part reason testing overburdened people freak someone saw COVID. Anxiety bad treated normal. 

The way mental health handled well crisis blows away. Trump telling wear mask, know things get really really bad. cant even get shit together texas talking fucking drive thru strip club???? culture part important everyone forgets it.

Countries culturally wear masks turns also wear masks now, wow!
Countries culturally less individualist collectivist also done better, surprise.

I'd surprised USA would better position another president, surely slightly better much. Politics still depended governors willingness people obey them. Karen going Karen matter who's president. States access capital float nonessential workers months. feds do. provided option states said shut according established guidelines enforce adequately, state receive funds. 

States would get line real quick. '

And deaths going since July 6th. 67% 16 days.

Why ignoring data last three weeks? literally 'conscientious' reason reject wearing mask. NONE. renamed 'psychopathic murderous objector' clause.  Trump Whitmer could legally issue mandate entire US state Michigan state emergency. Neither however encourage actual lawmakers pass sort laws covering this. also take care state/federal law reaches far boundary personal property private business.

That's happened states far though, worrisome emergency powers state emergency urgent emergency actions. gets hard argue point last 4 months could gotten lawmakers together pass law masks public government spaces/buildings. We've pandemic 4 months point governor president, politician think ahead figure could make law least minimally covering government spaces, parks etc. easy way use executive mandate, we've started use going end easier continue road instead actually creating legislation regular way. 5 cents... think read driving deaths due speeding racing initial lockdown.

One thing I'll never understand culture we're freaking covid, rightly so, one addressed 42,000 Americans killed car accidents every year. another 2 million injured.

If reduced speed limits 45 cities 30 could save 30,000 lives year.

Total tangent, but... Whatever. pretty clear we're barely know we're point. mean, happens too. Yup. Imagine principal sending notice 1000 parents says even children get covid, maybe 1 1000 die. want wonder that's going child? paying attention, Trumpists lot active Reddit lately Well jsut send back school can't catch summer camps anymore. /s agree notion shouldn’t say “efforts totally wasted.” you’re right, significant amount people, regardless politics, took disease seriously, best stay educated take precaution. Instead, let’s go “we could’ve done much better nation world stage (and people!) much better RIGHT NOW.” question need answer “what‘s stopping us better?” 

Why difficult America combat COVID19? They’re definitely something gets thrown around. It’s untrue? she’s 20 still parents insurance Yeah that's oddly specific.

Or think devils lettuce general “If possibly true, need full scientific study see could happen. control group” - Florida Didnt know decades? eating disinfectant, sanitizer, etc know? Shit isnt made thin cardboard plastic bag chips in. Itll seep right through.

There's precautions take dont involve eating lysol Plenty ears there. Ez. sick people would rather stay home VS going hospital get checked cancer aids diabetes etc. get worse die home. happening worldwide  got called CCP chill said Mao CCP same. Cultural Revolution essentially disgraced Mao going party. Even still, deaths counted yet [until death certificate officially depending municipality could backlogged. (e.g. [NY [CT [NJ backlog hospitals too, backed coroners' offices, funeral homes, municipal state public health offices, death data based official death certificates finally makes way federal government. 

Most places make sure deceased indeed tests positive coronavirus declaring COVID death tests likely enter waiting period results everyone else.   only.. today spoke woman said cuts holes mask breathe, “they can’t see holes shuts hell up”. right coughing hands trying shake mine!! course offended moved farther away came near told don’t shake anyone’s hand socially distance. wasn’t sick.. spreading sickness holes mask. Boggles mind. I’m curious many protests. think 50/50 chance barista infected meant assume argument's sake barista 50% chance infected, what's chance caught barista? Honestly kids mostly fine that’s main issue opening schools though it’s would effectively spread population is! winning we’re supposed get tired! know I’m sure tired shit. 😡 consolation, I'd say 95% people see wearing masks properly. 5% foregoing letting nose hang out, nonsense. We're saying thing. virus spread amongst kids, big problem. people kids going come contact lives people school worried they're great relatively speaking moaning money?

that's like florida refusing shut ""we new york"" month later squawking ""FEMA SAVE US"". 

Again, vengeance, literally ""if X, happen, refuse work limit spread expect bailout"" X outraged happened. event, let sue. turns illegal, let money. legal, maybe encourage follow state orders.

If give child ice cream tell put sister's hair cannot go movies friend dinner, ""vengeance"" if, sticking ice cream sister's hair, go home instead movies. every incidence prudently applied consequences (as ""don't refuse take seriously actions turn around expect state take seriously money"") vengeance, sometimes teaching moment ""I throw good money bad policy"" CBD might help this! friend mine diagnosed general anxiety disorder swears it. get edible pill spare lungs Ok cool. overestimated population l. literally mention race. Yes, context, talking him, extension, whites. 


But example could applied variety religions races different contexts. Trump merely asked question right. watched presser live. It’s clear asking question giving order. Hell yeah, let's put criminal justice system good use make unforgettable example next person try shit like that. 1% donors get billions bet, poor babies! quit Feb, added COVID numbers... Hey, that's fair. big sweetheart's also pretty nice Ghislaine Maxwell. thoughtful answer. understand things look up. Curious, know bubonic plague bacteria, black death period reoccurrences happened, plague changed killing mostly adults killing lot children 3rd 4th reoccurrence. think virus could mutate similar thing 5-10 years? Wolf moron here? laid specific clear rules *literally every county entire state* apparently able follow, commissioners Lebanon county said ""fuck it, care rules"" they're suffering consequences it. wanted money could followed rules like everyone else. Actions consequences. people learn they're toddlers, apparently Lebanon county commissioners never learned. Well they're learning hard way. could see tanking economy spite. ""Your mum bat, dickhead""


""Your mum heap customers wet market too"" past tense not? Australia. Well try Walmart youre talking NOVA probably 50% mask rate best, nose-weiners included.

Inside DC ya lot rarer definitely seen it. Went pick pizza (Papa Johns near navy yard) nobody wearing inside, staff customer way out. Whole Foods south capitol customers point several staff nose-out one wearing chin.

I feeling enforcement severely lacking. Something need done though, DC good past week+ saw increase...granted still relatively well compared many places....  You’re right. take back say fuck everyone provide link fact check USA Today. click?

 ruling: True  rate the claim hospitals get paid patients listed COVID-19 ventilators as TRUE.  doctors get paid Medicare patients diagnosed COVID-19 considered presumed they COVID-19 absent laboratory-confirmed test, three times patients placed ventilator cover cost care loss business resulting shift focus treat COVID-19 cases.  higher allocation funds made possible Coronavirus Aid, Relief Economic Security Act through Medicare 20% add-on to regular payment COVID-19 patients, verified USA TODAY [American Hospital Association Special topic. highest daily death count March-April peak.

I know drop bucket compared normal global daily deaths, upsetting knowing bad. Many families lose loved one today. Sure! trying say teachers California New York State leftist, California New York State compose 1/4 country's population. wrong counts. NY+CA 58.96 million US 328.2 million, like said, there's many studies teachers' political affiliations, claim they're ""very leftist"" unsupported. Well least gave one day vs others giving week so.

Clearly impossible get work done without constant inspiring presence boss. even another year, literally could months point. postpone everything Good Cuomo least biggest balls ask it. He’s got biggest balls all! right. 👏 👏 👏 Incorrect. It’s two. course, we'll kill cure every single bat. Easy. would probably kill election chances, right thing do, he's pissed everyone cult member, happens turns them? talk radio way earlier still is. Less talking proving, fatass timeline 30-40 days.

Memorial day like 55 days ago. shit supposed throw hands say ""ya got me"".  Hang there. went northeast. still using single use ppe weeks I'm that. way would extension. No, Cuomo De Blasio made bunch disastrous decisions early on, held account it. Obviously putting COVID-positive patients nursing homes disaster, there’s way spin that. 

This talking point particular frustrates reasons. One people long dead, talking points can’t bring back — lesson learned everyone else. mostly, often brought downplay threat virus, implication nowhere else stay locked down, nursing home deaths inflated overall numbers. Clearly, seeing exactly entire country maintain restrictions even though “it’s NYC thing.” Finally, harping nursing homes often used discredit every Cuomo policy failure. that’s deadly shame, he’s provided blueprint crush curve *once outbreak control you’re seeing 10,000 new cases day hospitals overrun*, gradual partial re-opening without sparking immediate resurgence. that’s exactly predicament FL TX right now. People pushing towards reopening schools understand people like woman care anybody. send kids school even tested positive.  Taste Sicily, Rotunda Brewing, Quentin Tavern, Funcks, Rising Sun, others. wife live Lebanon keeping tabs know businesses patronize things back normal. like trying get movies free. Minimum wage 40 hours week doesn’t even cover rent, let alone leave anything left save.

It’s shitty legislators allow companies exploit American employees. companies can’t afford pay staff living wage, sounds like they’re ones need learn budget.  [South saying nothing mind injected, even though mentioned disinfectant, clueless thinks like 10 year old? accept interpretation, often talks ass nothing absurd uninformed train-of-thought. want say yes, idk. hadn’t gotten better education better world view, I, like rest family, would think mental illness weakness.

So put mask couldn’t breathe, hurt general, would choice: “I weak”, “these bad you”. large number people pick door number 2, even wasn’t conscious decision. Add targeted messaging boom: trying hurt make obey. Given inputs could make person damn near anything self interest, ignorance pride.

Being able look wrong answer figure got fix it. math problems failings society. Read article it. inside Wally Mart since March. mean, safely push 2 weeks without losing funding?

As long start end august, fine. schools discussing/planning extending start date gop convention hopes second governor shut again.  someone goes store takes banned life. Period. local law enforcement called sot hey escort get ID information ban them.
They need stop allowing it...its nuts! 15 years ago was. Still obesity problem longer fattest city. outrage, moot anyway. Lebanon bad numbers compared rest state. appears county commissioners actually right. entirely political vengeance Wolf. shit condescending prick People really think go get jobs wild. forget voter suppression. people vote want vote -- many literally can't. No, tax dollars paid ass it. 175 cases polio(WPV) 2019, 99.5% 350,000 cases 1988.

WPV2 declared eradicated 2015.

WPV3 declared eradicated animal reservoirs pets whatever zoonosis (have figured whether pangolin bat yet?).

That makes eradication pretty much impossible. remember New York hundreds deaths single day. numbers must higher reported. could thousands Americans dying near future everyday.  There’s 350 million people America

Paying quarantine time much cheaper shutting businesses. Yes quarantine supervised, nobody charge fines breaking quarantine. moronic nobody taking blame. Wash, rinse repeat. recurring lightheaded-ness possible symptom COVID? heard kills crisis actors? sure downvoted asking question? think hygiene getting better, guess we'll wear masks everywhere forever. I've seen, younger people take lot longer die get better (once hospital), whereas older people going symptoms die faster. Since average age covid victims gone down, likely going see longer gaps onset death.

This particularly scary longer someone hospital, resources take up. callous sounds, hospitals turnover rate due majority patients older people, likely going overburdened quicker longer. Wtf You’re Ill-informed trying cover tracks bad arguments. last comment shows lack basic understanding vaccine process. 

Your source said could take months. I’m claiming it’s definitely going work, I’m lying it. kind blind, uninformed skepticism (when real, verifiable reasons skeptical) breeds anti-vaxxers. Obviously post whatever stupid shit want website, makes sense research first (or least fully read source).

Take care. wondered rare Republican led state well going realize he'd lost control. make easy waiting long. also true virus undergone many small mutations time? would suspect various strands going around early hotspots may deadlier combined fact hit real lockdown took place.

I hearing viruses tend get less deadly infectious time strains deadly tend kill hosts faster therefore smaller chance spreading. while, strain infects kills less prosper deadlier variants slowly diminish.

I would love hear since I've recently heard NYTimes podcast see mutations every 2 weeks average. case, explains preliminary mortality rates higher since would imply early strains virus deadlier now, generally speaking. fan people using latest data try downplay early data inaccurate sensationalized.

The idea virus mutating also lends possibility certain mutations could also start coming may deadly infectious depending much allow spread. anyone insight this? someone asthma, confirm same. Open air vastly dilutes virus, infected person middle seating area, someone going downwind them, regardless way wind blows. I'm going pass.

Different virus, famous event American Epidemeology [War Bond Parade Boston hte Spanish Flu immediate, deadly outbreak, cities didn't.

He's one trust knew taste Sicily thought they’ve open since April lebanon thing. terrifying. *\*Shudders\**

To own. man!  ""we're improving"", ""we're better every nation"", ""it'll go away""... ""Florida 'a big tough position'"". He's gonna ride sides fence say ""See, right"".

To honest, care. long starts something improve situation. I’ve safe stayed away grandma passed away old age couldn’t visit her. regrets unassisted living home I’d feel total guilt cause spread 20 grandparents. sacrifices make time being, cause even one death, hang lifetime. I’m even state bad Florida wife [have decided](http://blog.edsuom.com/2020/07/balancing-harms.html) high school kids going back campus fall. One flatly refused go; kid knows what’s up. R.I.P. /u/Profarmgirl4. seems like subset patients hiding body, probably CNS, resurfacing whenever finds opportunity. explain testing negative positive multiple times, well flare ups disease symptoms.

Anosmia quite common, could entering CNS via olfactory bulb. ACE2 expressed many tissues, hiding somewhere else too. u show article wedding india groom died caused huge outbreak district/state. Tell Ohio want come anymore... Adults could asphyxiate easily seems risk we’re willing take? Go Lowe’s without shoes shirt then. See like that. Perhaps article silent acknowledgement base mom pops gone 2022 need Yelp.  virus is, what, 7 months old? one knows shit lifelong damage also said won’t mask police arresting people relief lol. water wet?

we proved two-three weeks ago. ""The ""mean"" ""average"" used to, add numbers divide number numbers. ""median"" ""middle"" value list numbers. ""

You need use mean maths attempting work data skewed. 

Age set: 15 80 80 80 80 

Mean: 67

Median: 80

Life lost set (assuming average 85): 70 5 5 5 5 

Mean: 18

Median: 5

&amp;#x200B;

This headline would use mean median. Winter coming.  swear I've heard before. launched marketing campaign called MaskUpHoosiers couple weeks ago, supposedly leaning goodwill people mask up. He's wearing masks public since March, even apologized taking unmasked photo someone April. would chalk mandate anything Trump.  strip clubs either staff furloughed simply able offer contracts entertainers.

That would amazing move. would gladly patronize American club furloughs adult entertainers, suspect furloughed staff salaried employees, i.e. managers. People could die asphyxiation due wearing masks that’s risk we’re apparently willing take Yep, I'm 33, designer print world 10 years... can't get damn job unemployed since December   nfl made decision presence fans stands, right planning leaving teams/states/cities. says fans allowed, must wear masks. already buy masks team’s logo, least helps merchandising. 

Personally, think leaves home teams cities don’t allow fans competitive disadvantage. Good public health allow fans, bad competition uneven. nfl choose public health competitive fairness money? We’ll see... women also sit toilet versus peeing standing up, might case. However, men might poorer hygiene women thus could reason it. Also, assume everyone contracting higher percentage new infections covid-19 comes using bathroom immature. encouraging, extent protection cells offer seems pretty controversial.

That said, offer reduction symptoms that’s great news, even it’s total immunity. 6 times deadlier flu we're crippling country it? joke. 900+ deaths 40% us population far lesser testing indeed much worse us. wear masks can't get food CDC says good. 8 years long time. Ample time get competent professional. That's virus. Virus linked studies someone else well support claim. Thank you. Whatever said class bigotry, anti-vaxxers tend white middle class parents college education average household income. However second example above, different ethnic socioeconomic group altogether. **The thing common anti-vaxxers.**

Emphasis added. 

The class I’m referring “heterodox class” adequate put class together. I've feeling constantly tired last 10 years so. Gavin Newsom send national guard OC? sound like you’re tired winning. Maybe got downvoted misusing ""affects"" instead ""effects"" Interestingly enough covid, days struggle breathe, mask makes easier. wonder anti-hand washers like deal time, chucking kids ball pits pretending Polio would go away own. many countries flattened curve months ago? Yes walking protestors couple weeks ago yellow phase. He’s idiot.  don’t understand makes believe numbers...? mean, American corporate news pure propaganda, anyone curious mind knows this. even pay attention, much less behave accordingly? don’t get I’ve danced 8 hours full respirator fine. Serious question: executive branch federal government actually mandate something like that?

I know constitutionally, federal government gets certain powers everything explicitly granted goes states. federal power would mask mandate fall under?

(I include would wonderful whole country agreed mask mandate. wholeheartedly agree. I'm curious government powers situation)  Don’t China CoUnTrY! hard way. That's U.S. gonna learn. federal government legal authority mandate enforce mask wearing. That’s States, doesn’t stop federal government recommending mask mandates publicly.

And February-ish would great, essentially one, especially public sector, discussing serious measures contain coronavirus point time. lot public officials actually recommending go well March. Human nature messed effort up. still polio earth. nearly gone CIA used vaccinations way find Osama. validated anti-vaxxers narrative vaccines attempt US control whatever bam, polio still thing. even terrified needles still get done every year. really big deal. bad like take blood. causes pass out. vaccine easiest shot ever. said saves two weeks misery. especially work sick. Id shop shit dollar tree online doordash shit Imagine living guilt rest life. raised grandparents literally takes breath try comprehend would feel cause something like that.  10% school funding federal. Also that's school district's decision cut teachers. could cut useless employees administration centers nothing simply friends superintendent, never do. Zat vas Medizin  fucked thing current system insurance companies / PBOs need show something value, ""negotiate aggressively"" get prices - prices inflated super high pharma *because* know PBOs need big discount number show off. insurance companies purely parasitic relationship end users. former CEO GSK actually went head PBO. trade personnel time. countries single payer, government pharma company negotiate prices directly extra layer fanfare. Uggh. Terrible...

One quote really got though..""Behind numbers people"" 

Many us US seem forgotten worse yet dont care every statistic human being. I'm waiting die. bad take lots others them. Yeah well Florida paying wages sins. also live state incompetent governor (DeSantis). 

Wish luck... means wants disappear election issue anymore. slow-roll reporting looks like decline, declare victory. flew Southwest. soon crew walked away quite people took masks off. amazing watch people purposely selfish shitty. whole family got flu shots except older kid (3), got sick flu pediatrician considered tamiflu. kid (1) maybe got bit low grade fever bit, wife got flu all. previous year, pretty much got flu, get tons vitamin C, wife gets vitamin outside multivitamins. Vitamins shit unless deficient. Things like Emergen-C borderline snake oil claims.

You want know anti-medicine new age holistic shit gets you? Dead. MIL see doctors, touch medicine, researched health issues obsessively, took sorts super healthy things, basically FODMAP, heart attack 70 atherosclerosis. FIL doctor 10 years, turns afib heart trying beat 120BPM constantly despite cuff saying 70, he's getting meds risk stroke really high. Eat moderately healthy, get sleep, control stress, listen doctors. natural diet healthy. we, Babylonians? special 60,000? coronaviruses provide neutralizing T-cells SARS-COV2, mass outbreaks like early psychiatric ward Korea 101 103 patients examples prisons exceedingly large % population test positive. Sample size definitely small Society deemed (rightfully IMO) must sacrifice 3 plate squats sake slowing spread. build back year safely go back gyms.    wash hands fine. Duh! 

Also pretty sure God protects faithful virus. got bottle dial soap one hand King James Bible other. Thump thump. Gonna fine. Tl;dr - Christian bakers decision consequences. matter. Tons people done experiments. I've seen dozen videos. people decided masks dangerous convinced otherwise anything. Yep, know pattern now. downvoted yesterday suggesting Texas yet peak would getting worse. Sadly, addicts fixated self consider people's views interactions others playing self-image. minds, long believe right, right. would frame reasons committing crime (for money) way redirects blame away themselves.

""I steal society give shit me, like supposed to""

""I mooch parents can. raise right.""

""I'm jail hatin'. think I'm dangerous ugly.""

Basically, locus control shifts society concerns matters personal responsibility, social obligation, sacrifice, consequences (ex. ""The government give welfare"" vs. ""I clean find job"") Almost like two different things. beautiful miracle. Microcasm government mandates vs governor saying ""I wear mask sometimes! too! :) "" don’t know. made horrible mistake sure type people go visit 80 year old grandparents aren’t usually people could give crap dying. Well, going either place now.  lot vacancy this. Time move Florida. high you...? stop spreading misinformation. post literally makes point redundant. SARS MERS sure seemed disappear. could started Obama swine flu 

Not American Obama set binary playbook deal something like Swine flu? Trump dismantled?

Do assign blame Trump that? prob, I’ve every spreadsheet open recently - must’ve recent stupid windows update. additional bonus, also makes Class-A classhole.... claim Conscientious objection science... ‘Merica winter going bumpy ride. see death mass.

""No worries, me."" True. There’s also oil aspect. fuck. know sarcastic numerous Americans today lost friends family today, everyday. Seriously fuck subreddit fake ""cheering"" people die numbers climbing. bit respect Christ didn’t time, however getting crushed here, called idiot American Fox News watcher......

Ok don’t know get twice not, however reports people testing positive testing negative know WWE, doesn’t change content statement belief one become reinfected seen newer studies fading antibodies seen would small sample size people actually able get virus twice simply hasn’t around long. think need wait months really know answer either way. Also news T-cell immunity also coming light. would impossible. tiny Massachusetts town, six roads crossing border Connecticut. take every town borders CT, RI, NH, VT, NY Massachusetts. talking hundreds, thousands state border crossings would checkpoints. would case nearly every state country.  problem is, hard disprove negative. prove fraud *isn't* happening? lack evidence? present information? 

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. want claim widespread corruption fraud, whistleblowers credible information? reports back up? reported fringe conspiracy websites? burden proof situation, you. Definitely deaths dire situation. That’s works. can't lead they've rejected concept governmental leadership. logistics would crazy, man every single road river state. Even somewhere like Maine, shares border 1 state 1 side looking like 400+ points entry roads rivers alone.

Not mention border cities. fucking Hanover’s pflugerville? Kminder! 30 days hurt citizens taxes pay bad choices cost way .004% chance dying pre-existing conditions. 

 
And you’d idiot think 1000 deaths weight population 330 million. 

Last year 24,000-60,000 died flu. clenching purse deaths happening? 

People clueless would wear strap tv told could save virus 99.6% survival rate Lmao. Get outside man Dollar Tree, depressing dollar stores. another reason never go again. Oh, we're judging people usernames now, chickenbutt?  happens pretty frequently, I'm gonna lie.

I'm young stupid, mind changes easily. Thanks compliment wrong, though! expecting that.  Let try  so, guys still arguing hoax? can't believe it. I'm living world filled morons unfortunately.

You’re right, don’t get pass least leftists despise them. also Bush still bigger murderer/terrorist far wars. Right that’s us. tests slow unreliable. Lmao, ok Putin! trustworthy user name. go vlad? Yep. Turns federalism sucks every state page prevent flareups spread. [This essentially America's covid   Last week 500 two days row. Crickets sub, crickets CNN MSNBC. RemindMe! 30 days tests positive covid, they're covid patient

Yeah, that's tests work. Good job. Actually, don't. presumptive positive enough ICD-10 code disease. US bumbled COVID-19 ICD-10 coding compared parts world.

COVID-19 Coded Differently US, That's Good Thing. ones already *way* bag. wouldnt make sense, would point? Thank you. completely genuine saying words wise. understand bloodthirsty healthy place us individually collectively. thank talking that.

Honestly reading lot comments thought people making found difficult breathe excuse wear them. Wont cut beer drinking? offers real rebuttal say could spend hours refuting him, that’s even pseudoscience, it’s opinion piece. 

If read studies full, masks absolutely nothing stop spread viruses. supports whine anything crisis

Because current government *doesn't give fuck* lives Americans; care keeping factories running customers buying.

This incompetence, malice. legitimate ""medical condition prevents (wearing mask)""? Would get pass adult intellectually disabled really understand what's happening pandemic? They’re another study August believe. live here, curious results be. Indiana analytics studies regarding coronavirus surprisingly good podunk state. last vacation? Unplug reality go somewhere else away people things mind. 

It’s amazing get used youth older adults completely unacceptable. never acceptable chance change environment hopefully. Depends insurance county options. midwest location, places like Walgreen CVS try $15 flu shots insurance work with. counties also health departments supply ""cheap"" options people without insurance around $50-$85 per person.

If work, probably reasonable insurance, probably can't easily afford 'low cost' option county. There's hair food that, numbers FIXED. OG Microsoft assure steam makes billions dollars alone Sir, you’re Wendy’s drive Herd immunity works immunity persists consistent across population.

That's deep me. simple American peasant. actually ran across local news article this. malicious - way they're queues. someone leaves, everyone gets bumped slot. believe Florida saw world black white, unfortunately. Would lot easier was. love nation much fundamentally wrong IMO

The event really kicked distaste nation Early US History course took couple summers ago, might well called history Native Americans getting absolutely fucked. 

A nation founded stealing massive amounts native land, building economy slavery (To day), many Presidents hand both... fundamental issue nation cannot changed without massive overhaul federal local governments, saying can't happen, havent seen anything yet gives confidence *will* happen Technical issues preventing accessing article. law U.S. Government negotiating drug prices? Pfizer's CEO told time magazine they're shooting October clearance. delivery TBD. straight lie. counties far cases deaths Harris, Dallas, Bexar, Tarrant, Travis counties. border counties like Hildalgo, El Paso, Cameron indeed among top state comes cases deaths, nearly many five big city counties previously mentioned. even point correct, places call ""North Mexico"" still much part Texas rest state. someone IBS - already concern, risk would even bigger, confirm I’d probably cry.

EDIT: clarify, I’m going 100% favor locking - I’m completely terrified everything going right now. trying make shitty (pun intended) joke expense. felt clarify things, think reason I’m downvoted. That's reason sacrifice everyone blood-clot, organ-damage death cult. That's even reason shut shit down. work library butt seat things home, creates additional risk go get car repairs, gas nothing clean hands using pump, etc. say community wants library services, stop spreading disease first. It’s shame don’t know definition ‘communism.’ Orange bunker boy said patriotic wear mask polls suck make nationwide federal law? Also, deadly greatly depends availability things needed treat severe cases. higher case numbers get, people unable access medical resources. problem Levine ordering COVID patients back ill-equipped nursing homes spread infection taking parent nursing home stay hotel pandemic? That's source vitriol I've seen Levine, well-deserved.  state that? pretty sure state caps unemployment $326 month.

Downvoted $326 per week Right? I've saying since February least. soon Italy, containment chapter closed. Sure, everyone deaths life lost see Texas much help still aren't, think states past point return virus stick around till vaccine made Trump finally say right virus disappeared Presumably county collected extra revenue staying open counties closed. use instead federal aid.   constant close quarters? cancer survivor also. Crazy little mind...  They're bright. Insurance stopped covering pandemic cancellations almost immediately citing acts God. KN95 don’t work well you’re dusty crawl space mold, 50 year old knows what, crap fires, etc. 

Before pandemic job burned 3 3M N95s day dusty was. Meanwhile feel like I'M crazy person trying social distance wear masks go public. live rural Oklahoma. county big, approximate population 30k, majority two biggest cities, 15k them. 672 cases (just two cities!), comes 4% infection rate (I hope math correctly). jumping 20 points per day right freaked scared. Truly greatest people spend time shit posting reddit lol. start high school football 12 days... so... ya... nothing matters anymore. Kentucky problem. AG even suing governor get executive orders pertaining covid reversed. Politics, AG GOP governor democrat. Oh yeah, that's actually going [way, way longer six worries people even seem *willing* process information anymore.  True. dick - admitting it’s real. big article NYT weeks ago traced history vaccine testing regulation. lot regulations got tighter failed/dangerous polio vaccines, “warp speed” had/has built certain amount regulation relaxing red tape cutting. Minnesotan I've waiting this. hoping started seeing surge positive test results regardless, better late never. governor constantly rushed rep held Minnesota senate threatening every turn. increased restrictions, they'd pass bonding bill etc etc. Gazelka crew nothing less partisan hack jobs playing part. saving lives posturing blinded base understand difference democracy authoritarianism gov.

Hoping Wisconsin also jumps aboard bandwagon. say full understanding absolute horrible bullshit Evers going joke Supreme Court. Wearing mask political. public safety civil partnership. want economy bounce back quick possible? majority population wearing masks public fastest way so. want open schools? remedy. 

Wearing masks political. science clear study study solidifies even more. vaccine approved readily available dispersed amongst masses, best defense collectively community wide participation science driven mitigation techniques. Bottom fucking line. one Lorain county. Huh, ur right. Launch nukes Trump, people die every day. Might well get rid we’re it.  Ikr

USA developed (lol) country guns rights health. Literally.

Gotta gtfo shit hole country, folks hard support family can't pay rent, food, water, electricity, internet, etc. 

Also, chance severe coronavirus low (if one senior). chance getting evicted begging food high income. Trump’s called “Chinese Virus”. Maybe call “Chinese Vaccine”. Imagine 3-week-high 60 cases. element may affecting mortality rates level exposure. Anyone infected early waves wearing mask, infected someone wearing mask. Therefore viral load would higher leading severe illness. 

People used social distancing mask wearing now, even people it, better March one it. Would valid scotus hearing 10 minutes later laugh it. 

There federal statutory authority dreamed Feds mandate mask worn private businesses. 

The closest think inside federal buildings.    Ridiculous. solution. Let’s make felony put prison. prison population isn’t full enough yet. I'm Baltimore done OK one thing kind annoys people businesses keep masks around neck coworkers put customer walk in. better nothing think people fail realize breathe stuff air walk in. know probably annoying best keep whole time. 

 easy say work situation seems science eyes. anti-masks mind infantile anyway.. kidding? first rounds go healthcare workers. go politicians families. go top 1% money. Next CEOs families. trickle effect full force. doubt general population sees another year best. worn one press briefing. Two words disprove hypothesis: excess mortality yet happens. know people different reporting sources, see 6901 deaths June 25th 7222 deaths July 18th. CDC reporting 192,000 deaths average expected time year.  hate too. cringeworthy moments refer us ""family"". I’m southern part state we’re delayed two weeks already. associates coming nyc work they’re planning go here. I’m debating get stern tell what. know exposed, idea tested. wish they’d responsible go here. Crossing fingers Desantis issue one FL day now. 


Jk. hope FL. Desantis gop/trump sycophant.  going die state voters ignorant. wasn’t confusing me. It’s simply truth. one knows yet. 

It’s around 7 months. immunity short term wouldn’t see new re-infections yet. agree immunity infection, big question long last measure it. plan throw Grandma wood chipper that's takes get re-elected. professors/schools mandate attendance, penalize missing, require doctor's note. Even back March professor ask kid doctor's note. point time, basically impossible get covid test, sick little could appease professor.  California rent extremely high.  already said I’m nicotine user man. couple weeks, couple months ago.

As adderall, hard pass. went gifted kid barely functioning teenager couldn’t trust anything. Adderall let go nearly dropping high school, failed 5 6 classes. Took algebra 1 three times, friends time felons addicts now, masters Degree engineering.

Being catatonic homeless would increase anxiety too.

But would far efficient blow brains drag 5-10 year decline hell, blowing then, drunk high whatever ragged clothes brain doesn’t function well enough string words together. test capture 50% true infections group, adjust final results 2x get adjust estimate corrects testing error. know talking Indiana, Texas death rate spiking, part due hospital system overwhelmed.

Business booming funeral homes! Costco started requiring masks beginning May. Ah. Sigh. Today walked local grocery store northern Indiana employee front giving free masks asked lady put mask even offered plastic face shield apparently couldn’t wear mask goes, “Sorry that’s gonna work either.” proceeds walk store without mask. employee looked like...WOW.... even noticed lady coughing walked past way out...I would love see someone like get fined... hats come blue? *sigh* .. mean get eventually like common cold? body can’t handle gg? Maybe check facts. SBA PPP loans went businesses used payroll fixed business expenses like rent utilities. still money available businesses use.

Stimulus payments went Americans.

COVID effected businesses too. think pandemic right time gouge employer raise. anything make going work riskier. work big companies; they're dilute. saw wife guy ICU ventilator son went bar. got sick father needed vent. July 23, 00:00 (UTC+9)

Among 20 imported cases,

America : 9 (US)

Europe : 1 (UK)

Asia outside China : 10

- Russia 5

- Kazakhstan 1

- Tajikistan soldiers front-line unit tested positive July 21 showing fever symptoms previous day. members unit went testing, 12 found virus contact confirmed patients. Around 50 soldiers put strict one-person-one-room quarantine and entire base placed cohort isolation.

A career counselor, living Gangnam, visited unit invited lecture counseling July 16. hearing news, got test wife tested positive. media field day, singing outbreak front-line unit stroke Seoul. However,

- One two soldiers off-installation travel July 10.

- counselor visited unit July 16.

- two soldiers first showed symptoms July 20 tested positive July 21.

- counselor's wife showed symptoms tested July 21.

So possibility transmission way around. Let's see woman 50s tested positive Gwangju, resolved yet. 6 people contacted also tested positive.

Regarding Gwangju door-to-door sales office cluster, two people self-quarantine tested won’t since did, would appear siding dems surprised all. also suggested injecting disinfectant treatment. No. Nobody chose stuck favela slum pandemic. US top 3. It’s shameful.  ""need"" lot things.

Stay home sick.

PLEASE take care body (hygiene, starters), keep good social distancing. Yeah, mask, think invincible it. deterrent, deterrent. forget stuff, (I think biggest mitigation tool keeping good hygiene good regimen exercise supplements help boost immune systems...you regardless pandemic not). 

Be mindful, panic. Mindful, fearful. chase numbers time (and I'll keep opinions mask obsession minimal people like that), remember 94% recovery rate, chances going get better get really good (yeah, death rate nothing smile about, need keep people believing get this). great chance survival even full recovery. 

And God sakes, something get mind THIS! Watch movie, play game, take walk outside maintain exercise. Stop watching news 24/7. Stop hovering around social media (yeah, look saying pissing people today, haha). constantly hang around, going depress, anger, frustrate you, put greater risk (depression HUGE breeding ground. know also suffer panic attacks anxiety tend get something rate twice year). Find something LAUGH with! okay still happy every while. 

WE ***WILL*** GET YET! Drugs treatment also get better. vaccines worked on, all. Right. asshole reads something internet thinks he’s blown top national conspiracy. Dunning-Kruger finest. 15 years experience field. ""treatment"" think getting?

Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* guy really needs learn Texas history. Dont like all. governments perview. get feeling stand court. Likely many things governments us decided not. reason. Diet indiana came mind. He's saying bad briefings news reports months now. What's going besides remind everyone good people burying heads sand? Install bypass paywall extension browser choice git.  Uhhhh......strawman much? I'm I'm merely stating data showing....I'm aware seriousness situation. fact think I'm diverting attention pandemic multiple friends hospital ventilators disgusting mischaracterization me. seriously think I'm downplaying this, need reevaluate perceive comments. read posts interest, hope things get better you.

Have considered anxiety pulse might going check it? Could bit like white coat syndrome. 

Secondly know cook? keeps focused calm (obviously hotel). really enjoy making slightly different chilies, slightly extravagant breakfasts different types bacon sausages, tasty salads, yesterday cooked tenderloin steak first time months wonderful big side salad. 

I've away 'home' (at moment work China) since mid-January, first two months Thailand since mid-March Malaysia. beginning April started renting apartment so, many hotels cook sofa. time spent cooking, shopping good food drink, playing RPGs online first time ever, reading, watching movies huge SSD fortunately brought 'holiday'. I've never checked pulse still okay. 

Best wishes. Congress could actually pass law..... Looks good paper, **GUARANTEE** people gravitate towards end huddled together pods inside stadium. I'm 100% side curious source thoroughly disproved claim? Would love able use shut people let’s get everyone making these, enough everyone, give us free (for low cost) finally beat thing.

There point giving health workers people keeps getting infected.

If actually prevent even infections, heath workers won’t need treat them! amount co2 trapped mask pretty much non-existent, basically need sealed container co2 build appreciable way given exhale much co2 rapidly dissipates air. Lmao, underrated comment.  Opening bars biggest mistake.

Clearly motivated money. one could thought would end well. much insurance mean, do. that's also fraud feds huge bust. like high risk moderate reward.

Edit - clear hospitals get certain funds range covid related things, death. Detecting fraudulent claims would fairly easy tho. thought interesting school requiring saliva test. First heard anyone use saliva test. Yeah that's meant

Damn I'm REAL bad brain day. bottom 300M wage earners need pay full price, NYC also got overwhelmed. know doctor flew help manage COVID ward doctor worked unrelated field. NYC spike cases also occurred earlier on, disease management gotten better past six months.

I think run ICU capacity fatality rate would go back up, long keep everything contained able keep fatality rate down. think based countries handled successfully, best course action would’ve stay locked cases got low enough (we opened early), everyone mask big test trace keep things low. Life pretty much go back normal. failed steps tho sexist! dun dun dun wish coronavirus made uncontrollable diarrhea. Nobody would want leave house afraid they’d shit pants. Geneva conventions joke, fact think bearing issue shows know nothing history geopolitics.
All international law false construct, power nations use it. winner decides legal last war. Nothing matters winning war.
The US never sign treaty convention would represent infringement sovereignty.
You clue economics either, US cannot criple Chineese economy means short total war. Economies based production goods services, China means do. financial charade trading US entirely besides point. US cutting imports would shutter much single Chinese factory case war. Again, know history whatsoever, shows fanciful belief.
Bombing strategic targets enough, faith nuclear weapons foolish. third world war may well go nuclear, reason unleash every means disposal ensure total victory. time war fought, countermeasures existing delivery systems render strategic nuclear weapons far less decisive.
Instead spouting fanciful theories defeating vastly better equipped numerically superior force buying crap, reading Cold War military plans doctrine, apply war China. can’t handle piece fabric face small portion bigger issues aliens got news. Lmao, hates phrase “Remmington 401k”

But made middle age kind-of asshole think you’ve earned right grouchy old fuck 2045  probably man date places. Time tell Yep [positivity rates Florida increasing ton time goes Positivity rate basically doubled month ago (almost 10% higher). know theirs. branding notorious chapstick. virus 99% mortality rate within 24 hours would spread far kills many. slow killers ones damage. So, 90 days later. saying virus stopped? Thankyou feels amazing need anymore! Lol saying evidence human human spread late January. crazy blind people reality revisionist histories actually written near real time, literally rewrote classification criteria avoid declaring pandemic. response bizarrely inappropriate  They've moved death counts falsely inflated think word looking [exit Perhaps modify term include exit *masks*! help mashing bunch facts stew nonsense.

Neutralizing antibody titers dropping normal, also indicate fading immunity reinfection. dire warnings dropping titers leading short periods immunity measuring initial drop poorly extrapolating, agreed, still expect immunity wear time.

Then go conflate different kinds immunity. conventional definition people use virus reproduce, person suffer disease cannot retransmit someone else (this ""survivor island"" version ""immunity"" everyone kind understands). kind immunity mediated neutralizing antibodies.

There's also humoral immunity mediated T-cells may lessen disease severity (or may chances much better, still guarantee). kind immunity good you, get sick, still get infected virus, replicates, still transmit it. means individuals T-cell mediated immunity partially immune count ""herd immunity"" example, retransmit it.

And observed SARS-CoV-1 studies T-cell immune mice found mice got infected, got sick, lost ~30% bodyweight, 20-40% immunized mice died compared 100% completely non-immune also seen recently influenza, people alive contracted influenza prior 1957 still humoral T-cell immunity H1N1 even 5 decades mutations pigs H1 envelope protein still cross reacted enough old people get sick 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza reemerged. still got stick, still transmitted virus along, nobody immune (in survivor-island-sense) 2009 H1N1 pandemic start.

And vividly point matters. I've got strong neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2 contract virus, spread virus. Since two parents 80s would mean would impossible spread virus likely kill them. neutralizing antibodies fade, T-cells absolutely get infected pass along. I, personally, suffer much would totally virus-naive immune system, mean ""very little terms immunity"" state, means get infected fucking kill parents passing virus along them.

That distinction matters. must complete psychopaths able make decisions needlessly kill people acknowledge harms families that, seek get people immunity bad decisions. sleep night? Complete scum. 32% Americans 401k. cases testing means recoveries. 

Doesn't really mean anything, they're seeing cases. definitely hard breathe run though need take see nobody around me.

Other making nose runny, already wear outside I'm running. Hope serve food refreshments masks coming covid spread  Nice plot twist already given game ""shit hole country"". Americans dint place slinging mud anyone except Brazil point use MAGA talking point try bring persons argument reveals part basket shit heads. Meanwhile, Florida... that, conditioning base ignore social distancing masks sabotaging mail ballot option handicapping USPS. Democrats choose cast ballot via mail likely get vote counted less likely want vote person bunch MAGA idiots spreading virus.  I've said many times. Say whatever else want handling China identify trends, virus, determine much problem was...

When folks say never allowed spread, despite nothing advanced warning.. ridiculous logic. finally dress age act Mostly densely immigrant communities reporting I’ve seen. Except police departments bandwidth enforce masking. need hire quickly deputize mask police country. huge problem everywhere. Europe government backs banks back businesses continue pay payroll checks. get 80% salary. 30%. 150%. 80%. 

Makes way sense. What's dumb many people arbitrarily making less depending state live benefits state, much make. make 80k lose house former breadwinner unemployment. make 15k live roommates, bring save way making working. wonky. But....b..but haircut? Good. Stupidity price Awesome news. Ramp production ship neighbors need. could probably buy back 1/4 price get used. Lowe’s NE Tennessee today. Happy say one douchebag, everyone saw mask on. Yay! Hey, may one rhymed fault game ruined start  Never mind excess deaths (not officially covid) 28% year. anything counting covid deaths. Unless multiple employees tested positive. I’m sure workers compensation would filed Employers Liability usually limits $1,000,000. That's definitely big part contagious one. still dealt testing, tracing quarantines otherwise would still running rampant today. hard times since 2009. Think hard times stop soon? can’t even get now. We’re trapped live here. Masks mandatory everywhere Indy outside Indy wild west one cares anymore. It'll shit show soon enough. sure would anything sure active active congressman sides. people really need hole ground buried gonna cash one people's dead loved ones That’s he’s saying know it.

He’s insinuating “shutting economy” wasn’t prudent decision make comparison options (which he’s absolutely wrong - proven). 

If want play dumb - guest - won’t entertain conversation further. many people (of colors) say ""I wore mask!!!!! done ever'thanng prop'ly!"" wearing mask like woman? Coronavirus: “Damn guess switch difficulty hard...” Even though take time vaccinate everyone feel confidence manufacturing distribution deals made speed/scale everything worked to, time need immunize least 750k per day months really able sort end pandemic slow spread care, far actual extended lockdown closed schools would stop economy donors benefit from. That's they're they're doing. guarantee spread within family members  governors can't basic math. 🐑 didn’t say still knew talking deep down.. agree 100%. It’s celebrities donate money people criticise giving enough like it’s 200k gave Let’s honest, parents gonna continue sending kids school sick. Wow. American healthcare system really well designed. Man, can't believe still issue. Yeup. Winter coming NCAA NFL Ah, see go doctor's offices. I've 3 month; each, support staff wearing masks improperly. 🙄 countries, save Sweden China's East Asian neighbors, overreacting coronavirus.

Just got clear, think appropriate response nothing, US, barely anything combat coronavirus, overreacting? Follow-up question; actually idiot, ""username checks out"" situation, little both? Follow-up follow-up; get fucked. That's question. would argue already tanked. save wanted to. Putin want saved nothing done save it. Erm no, can't. literally reports people asphyxiating mask use, can't say covering infant's mouth.  also hard time breathing. instead anti masks avoid going costs. God damn people think ways hate masks. many times going post irrelevant link? partially true way makes revenue they’ve lost canceling elective procedures keeping many beds open possible. 

Government payers increase reimbursement ICU bed charges &amp; ventilators it’s profitable. Additionally, insurers incentivized pay little possible deny claims possible reason. 

It shows convoluted healthcare system average person could believe this.  ...damn. I'm sorry you.

The virus getting crazy large chunk elected officials stupid, greedy, cases outright evil. scumbags give two fucks *any* American, R move make benefits regular citizen hand forced. 

Our inept leadership getting worse. regular person wants virus cause damage, though sure seems like President, administration Senate do. brain broken think fake simply swing election.

The election swung Republicans *not* handling it. fucking conspiracy. Get help fucking rube. And, like, fuck extra people dying, then? hospitals weren’t “lying” dead people dying from?? fair, orange county mask mandate tried sue them.

But executive order forcing schools open....

Maybe he's good game keeps making mistakes way high score? one argument say point, early stages, hospitals reported covid deaths receiving federal funding deal virus. makes total sense, find area deaths contagious disease rising, want send money way help combat rising cases area. issue right wing nut jobs dont understand point, saw ""Hospitals reporting covid deaths getting money"" instantly went ""I guess faking numbers get money"". fact help hospitals deal something under-prepared for. Honestly, think biggest issue right wing idiots, lack critical thinking. hear Fox wants tell them, take fact without sources inform them... coworker whose employee asked take covid test returning said “but test hurts”, coworker said “so covid” lol We’re coming part it’s fault. Massachussets says leave us fuck outta shit show. shit China stood ground let consulate staff back Wuhan without quarantine PCR test. combat that, company made us start using Hubstaff track many hours day mouses moving. gag almost everyone back office. I’m home. micromanaged hell; it’s great Everything bigger Texas Yup, always clean, spacious, professional. this, i'll never fly Delta :0 just... don’t open schools... See find book faces, wish well. situation sure longer contagious not. I’m scared go spread others. I’ve quarantined I’m tired it. better. Maybe almost 2 weeks free symptoms fatigue headaches back. Fukn libz got 5G Oh, damn. It’s pretty sad virus literally start killing loved ones take seriously. 

I see. Numbers getting really bad winter Biden elected republicans start blaming Biden, completely forgetting trump calling hoax supporting states staying open. 

At point don’t even try argue anyone. virus going whatever it’s going do. I'm American correct wrong, Trump can't actually issue order ordinary citizens wear masks. Federal employees, military yes, rest country no?

However Whitmer might able issue order Michigan least convince state law makers do? politics played expense American lives? someone say this. response would hospital elective surgeries postponed longer longer thing lasts means matter receiving less money. asked hospitals going bankrupt supposedly make money. I'm y'alls side, really can't stand see posted constantly. Canada country, US Teritory. right come whatever reason. claiming refugee status point made condescending.

Please fix country. There's need mean correcting someone. military distribute vaccine (for years years years) great. think hit soon, that’s estimate least. miserable, especially bc need way. tiny local hospital almost full, patients moved Miami hospitals dying, included local count totally dark actual death toll community. (In Florida death counted occurred.) 

Pretty much every economist says know health preclude economic recovery.

I think calling Desant-ASS! Source claims. ass count.

They 25 days data protest started.

From paper

""In Panel (d) Appendix Figure 6, show trend COVID-19 cases full sample counties. show slope almost linear, suggests rate COVID-19 case growth relatively constant sample period."" No. literally don’t.
 
Stop pushing misinformation panic. billing code Covid Deaths. Knock off. say EU post. 
EU =/= Europe. TYL. telling freedom fighters starting put mask now? Seems wishy washy one minute government encroaching freedom. boom ""leader "" puts mask boom start.  Costa Mesa = Goat Hill mask makes air humid? Whenever wear mask 8hrs shift get nosebleed coz nose gets really dry :( Holy Fucking Shit reality whatever testing protocol place numerous loopholes. Anyone thinks NFL teams exploit (or wont lie) nuts. would absolutely shocked one starting QB amount time due covid Yeah, that's post subreddit. make mistake :) Flights air actually pretty safe cabin air replaced every minutes, viral concentration chance build up. system work aircraft ground - ventilation, filters reliable complete air exchange, take mask (i.e. drink water) aircraft flying. Turning personal fan may helpful disperse potential droplets area. Consider choosing airline strict mask policies like Southwest, removed exemptions. Watch YouTube video fit N95 mask properly, work less well surgical masks properly fitted. Take care! true FOX, thank something share anti-maskers know. 3 fastest vaccines world right now

China：Chenwei Vaccine

UK：Oxford University Vaccines,

Germany：BioNTech Pfizer Vaccines

None three vaccines originated U.S. information U.S. vaccines worth stealing China? way 5G became biological weapon. may something decision: Mississippi education widely considered one worst American get. Maybe lack seriousness issue might lead less engaged populace taking protective measures? Eh. They're catching exactly expected to. taught future tense school, yeah? one room building chief security cares about. Maybe took federal mask mandate? remember correctly, Germany kind fucking response beginning. every one gets right, right away.

Thank you, moment lockdown knowing would could visit other, always thought she’d make nature fickle thing. Even June would better Yeah parents watch CNN I'll ask FFS shit point...

I ashamed American, many good Americans American Culture whole anti-intellectual, short-sighted, values nothing $ end.

I mean look ""American"" food, bacon, burgers, hot dogs fried food... pandemic really disassociated nation, moving EU &lt; 5 years consider moving back significant traction racial equality income equality occurs

What mean say likely never move back US leave believe highest authority says caused testing. Wow good one, roll champ. First talking incest pedophilia, man bud really showing smarts. can't believe ever tried match wits intellect yourself.

I'm worthy conversation. Please forgive intruding day. !RemindMe 2 months friendly reminder keep civil. Celebrating someone’s death result ban. could go ""Demolition Man"" contact high five circle.

The handshake return effective vaccine.  initial symptoms (when usually go get test) death around 3-4 weeks US time someone dies death counted publicly 2-4 weeks. deaths lag 5-8 weeks behind tests.  Shit son. 16 days till another recess fucking month. government kind fucked. Turbulence. u/remindmebot !RemindMe 22 days

Hopefully you’re wrong constitution. Legal precedent. Many things. Dr. Trump disagrees  Nothing. We're never going situation greet people/introduce ever again, rate. Could share kind source this? DM don’t want publicly? I’m Oregon I’m currently pushing district reopen evidence lean better. covered Office can't find link  work home No. severe symptoms hospitalized. Ohio 1500 cases today 1100 people hospital COVID-19 already there. diagnosis hospitalization usually 7 10 days.. site help use lot data overwhelming.  Cue aliens landing Earth preserving species. Silly know, right? Look I’m passionate idea. Truth told simply don’t know much think virus around 5 months. google topic well. articles listed video shared scientific, however lack time waiting peer reviewed articles ect.... main driver believing one get Covid twice based antibodys fading quickly seen here. ""Social interactions start feeling really weird.” already like half us Hey. kids get infected, every state America go 2-5% infected 50-60% infected guess. Wasting breath, people eat paste. Whenever Trump opens mouth people smell shit even behind screen. Dude, anecdotes yelling people anecdotes better anecdotes. that's shitty testing suppression data... burned one lockdown, get another one. ""cases going down"" probably.

Plus, ""it's old fragile people"" Na don’t believe illegal immigration anymore do. they’re paying taxes net negative considering social services receive that’s loss country. Yeah, still salty “must 21 years old drink” extortion.  far right anti-communist organizations 50s went wild calling things communist. even called republican president communist (that president none eisenhower, too). ofc theres infamous ""x communism"" sign various protests China built bunch temporary hospitals?

I've following whole thing since first broke there, holy crap insane fast went up. People insult China lot things, impressed ton got done fast. never see here. downvoted this. situation China stabilized.

and / or

China screened departing territory thoroughly. 

Even situation China worst, found infected visitors China. Bus drivers. Employees store parents bring kids to. Employees store teachers go things like groceries copious amounts liquor imagine necessary position. 

Co-workers parents kids school. 

And on, on. sidestepped one today myself. wife knows someone died covid mentioned colleague said, “Of course covid. That’s get money.” followed questions prexisting conditions that.

I let drop moved on. It’s worth debating topic. I've heard 3 different coworkers last 2 weeks. 100% serious. One specifically claimed even die car crash count Covid case. asked evidence ,""was sure could find study"", never actually produced anything beyond swearing saw legit study it.

I'm loss get people. ready bring oh opening schools. Projections keep getting revised time. think reliable right now. Let's wait watch situation develops.

Let's hope deaths remain low understand flip side- currently .007% US population succumbed. ever hits 394k - it’ll finally hit .11% US population. 

Too many yes- could bunch avoided- probably. grand scheme human existence isn’t even blip species.

Cancer heart disease put blip covid. thread turned people trying get diagnosis internet strangers. tired today, corona? coughed drinking water, corona? Someone locked eyes across street without mask, corona? DON’T KNOW! Call doctor get test you’re worried. one anxious person another, stop reassurance seeking, know isn’t helping. Ah cool. problem then. cares weak infirm? Definitely you. 30k people year die automobile accidents US asshole thinking shouldn’t shut roads preventable deaths. It’s insensitive 30k “real people asshole!” died hold belief. sad truth functional concept acceptable loss life country. Maybe number 50k 200k 300k 400k year exist we’d shut somewhat risky activity things matter whether it’s preventable it’s “real people dying”. COVID deaths may grow, 100% explicit deaths/day rate acceleration rate trigger shutdowns. penny need now! Fucking A. Trump Virus killing Americans. US NUMBA 1 Spent time Madagascar recently. Absolutely everyone pops unregulated counter antibiotics like candy treat headaches, amd also plague outbreak couple years ago, plague still around. absolutely given *Yrsinia pestis* material needs develop resistance kill us. happened Italy. Texas definitely knew coming government nothing late. really sad frustrating. Yeah Brazil India also terrifying. many South American countries. look Columbia's numbers yesterday! LOL no, Bild, fucking pamphlet, sold newspaper. process remove sitting Florida governor? Something like impeachment recall? DeSantis unpopular Florida right now, still office. media making DeSantis unpopular contrary truth? Heat map isn’t good. 7 day avg deaths gets color. honest surprised many white spots low bar. 

Did like looking Texas Data state. like phrase phrase as, ""9/11 every three days"" even know that, TIL! ""It's two 9/11s week, mask works need mine?!?! America good. Covid deniers bad. State Colorado gone great lengths flush best way find full extent infection; one method keeps floating top. coworker thinks female representatives “F*ing B*tches”. want destroy police, America, get back white men.

He also drop “N” word several times sentence like kid saying “You know what?” story. America infecting world shit - partner conversation one Mum's school works today, Mum spouting shit. Australia?!

She even admitted watch news, gets information ""select"" Facebook groups?!!? flu like symptoms going get tested ""conspiracy"" FFS heartbreaking thing death rate US 4%. means yesterday's 71,967 diagnosed infected another 2,878 dead month. numbers we're seeing infected last month. recent science shows COVID actually causes widespread micro-embolism tiny blood vessels many organs, causing oxygen exchange blood flow organs (especially lungs, kidneys, heart) greatly reduced. causes low blood oxygen, heart issues, kidney damage commonly seeing.

Histology lung biopsies showed something like 30 70 percent microvasculature lungs completely clogged clots. 

Current theory happens virus causes huge spike Von Willebrands Factor people, causes widespread clotting. cannot treated typical anticoagulants, due large size protein. look Covid numbers wear mask idiots ! 🙄  Yeah “why stop month” then???? would call someone ridiculous pissing floor. would also call cops. Unity power. would never pull phone record.

Edit: also there’s difference mentality active shooter/stabber situation full egocentric childlike tantrum.  I'm sorry loss Yeah, well... maybe unwittingly stumbled onto real solution.  really going open schools? hear lot talk nothing sure. ton businesses didn’t even get loans, rather large ones somehow did. dried ton places forced close good. Walmart, Target, Amazon etc juuuust fine tho.

There $140 billion $600 billion still available SBA PPP funds. 

Walmart, Amazon Target huge online retail carry essential goods people needed. bad guys? makes mad government shut local hardware store essential Home Depot, Lowes Menards stayed open. Local hardware store got PPP loan still may didn’t even cover one month’s rent major cities. countries tenth wealth US paid people stay home stay safe it’s cool resume work life safely. here?

What countries paid employees stay home? Denmark paid employees 75% income 3 months? US paying $600/week 4 months. 50% unemployed that's 100% wages. Plus $1200 stimulus it’s fault businesses pandemic happened close, protect support actual workers people? 

Because provide jobs workers. protecting business protect employees. going pay employees businesses conditions become dangerous, absolutely time organize demand higher wages.

Do also support price gouging sand bags hurricane? exactly thing. Artificially inflating prices crisis illegal cases... guess benefits ok, right? SMH. Holy shit that's terrifying watched happened NY

I literally heard people say ""But NY."" thinking immune shit. Anecdotal, country (Japan) vast majority dumbfucks going without masks pulling masks talking someone men. Women pretty much follow rules neatly comes mask usage sanitizing hands social distancing, civil cautious general. always men like ""if get get it, whatever, I'm still gonna go drinking BARS"".

I'm sure biology accounts large part general lack caution increased psychopathic dumbfuckery risk-taking among high testosterone levels seems major behavioral influencer. seen CDC numbers actually deaths vs expected? Right pretty clear outlier indicating people dying normal. means covid death numbers cannot explained away simply via approach. fraction deaths reported people going die anyway? Yes. doesnt mean covid isnt cause death. stab hit heart shoot face, gun shot cause death death would count towards statistics murders guns even though going die stab wound inflicted me. entire position disingenuous start. Oh gosh - where’s logic police? Russia banned summer Olympics due doping. think main worry tourists. So, go ahead, may without physical crowd. .... hope realize kidding.... I've found actually presenting facts, sources correcting make look like brainwashed asshole them. told wrong listen cause leftists/liberal anything say they'll flip you. overwhelm much ignorance stupidity can't counter everything say they'll use losing argument proving right. nod head empitily say yeah ugh huh can't silent together. Saves huge headache go live road never worry again. thought hear listen shit anymore motivation need keep shit together move life work also get cafeteria voucher 16 h (but read contract know request it) 

whoo.hoo. Hi, I'm person arguing with. Sorry, think understand *they're* saying.

First - Downvotes mean anything. means people agree you. person said single thing true.

Second - said ""Well hospitals get money list death COVID don’t know?"" followed /s, implying sarcastic. 

Well, hospital bills cause death ""Suspected COVID-19"" receives reimbursement treatment patient another, less costly disease listed cause death. 

That's hospitals coding departments: get money insurance companies. 

That's true. indisputable. that's point they're making. 

**You implied something true, is.**

Of course, mean conspiracy theory true. not. completely insane, there's absolutely zero evidence doctors hospitals falsely coding deaths COVID-19. There's evidence anybody make money. would fraud ludicrous scale, we'd seeing whistleblowers dozen.

But, got discussion said hospitals earn money listing death ""Suspected COVID-19,"" wrong. do. course do.

Now, want get argument whether insurance company paying ""deaths"" ""treatment,"" that's pointless distinction basically meaningless. insurance company pays treatment based several factors, one cause death. It’s country club  I’m little worried what’s going happen places like Netherlands months, least low cases invested capacity if/when second wave hits say response there's also lot younger people well -

""it's damn millenials going spring break""

No, actually people ages

""well certain areas, bad am""

That's area people getting tested - you?

""of course not! That's silly."" *laughs* -

-actual bits conversations I've had


Edit : know I'm getting downvoted think everyone underestimating jackassery occur Labor Day set us good wave uncontrolled spread end summer, followed jackassery Thanksgiving. idea Democrats inflating death numbers make Trump look bad Mostly pandemic though electing unqualified leader multiplied effects.

Next economic effects, global warming going keep getting intolerable year. Finally systemic collapses biodiversity due consumption.

Advanced Civilization ain't gonna make it. Humans probably survive much lower numbers planet bounce back given time. think going fortunate enough many people know anyone dies this.  *but muh Diet Coke.* people saw happened NJ NY think going happen every state. Texas's projected deaths Nov 1 1/3 NY deaths right now. Florida same. fact Georgia, Texas, Florida's combined projected deaths Nov still less NY Dont forget teetering racial tensions soon homelessness crisis people can’t pay rent. know, I'm happy like USA also disappointed get rid like NZ even lower numbers SK.

I guess hard open borders dozen countries little state whatever want.

Here Berlin mask use mixed, especially old people. go doctor recently pretty much one wearing one, like WTF.

Every day still hundreds infected new deaths despite ""banning"" tourists put managed quarantine travelers. They’ll obviously say 1,000 deaths nothing compared X thing kills killed people. they’ll also move goal posts talk shit like “CBS using mannequins make look like hospitals overloaded” etc etc. transparency.. Hospitals get extra 20% paid Medicare covid patients regular respiratory illness. There's evidence they're faking numbers mess though. much covid action Ohio. Perks competency Goddamn trump virus like PUTOS..  definitely one way generate (missing) revenue. Yes personally think reasons.

For one, we’re still Pandemic. Even assuming everything goes plan vaccine released fall able go mass production.... take months upon months vaccinate enough population make big difference. Travel still going bad quite while.

Another reason would people leave region country, disagree it... harder gets change things. means one less vote change tide fix things. It’s lot ask someone stay location makes miserable... someone able that, it’s makes difference. Unless life literally threatened, don’t really need asylum, lot friends family sticking around. much make qualify that? I’m pushing 6 figures says 450. Underrated comment right really think gives shit? could hospitals full, full, willing able take people hospitals. guessing though. WINNING! BIGLY! Hospitals get money COVID patients.

Look, think COVID deathly serious listening Fauci re-opening fast wrong this.

They evidence places lying it, actually one spreading mis-information I'm FOX News hate, realize local affiliates operate largely independently former, right?

Now, they're owned Sinclair Corp, that's another story. I’m worried, it’s people kids likely suffer. Though south get roughed increasing hurricane seasons every year, I’ll stay colder climates there’s still snow left ski on. Tell barcode tattoo wrist scan Pretend want, Trump fucked there’s denying that. Unless, know, don’t mental capacity handle it￼ instead deflect bad jokes flew recently say ton nose too. states law stands little stronger store policy anyways. Good DeSantis sticking “principles”. stupid selfish. can't let go idea nothing changed. Close Louisville. Still sure that’s consolation though. probably top fit condition too, getting them. Older and/or people pre-existing conditions lucky. DeathSentance, Desant-ASS particular favorite. vote him.

Florida, like Nevada (specifically Vegas) dependant upon tourism pandemic changed much yet people want everything go back normal. us NV, know else do. local economies can't support gigantic infrastructure tourism built, we're staring total economic devastation. 

If keep letting virus spin control, economy anyway. mayor Key West's mantra can't healthy economy without healthy community. Yea growth rate went really slow first March-may. started growing june-july there's good amount countries starting grow last 2 months too. USA, get shit together please, embarrassing... earned certification epidemiology record time ! Devoting full weekend! always amazes people nothing better snoop people’s post histories. I’m always happy debate issues good faith, gets personal I’m out. Thanks true. sticks surfaces days, stick around air hours. unless Lowes medical grade air flow, specifically designed quarantine wards... chances much higher think.

Also. 150k dead US. Hundreds thousands hospitalized. million confirmed cases, numbers growing numbers corrected better testing, less false positives negatives. 

Now compare someone could shoot maybe 30 people they're taken down. like risk shot like idea dying bloody peanut butter lungs, hospital, respirator. 

Tl;dr: research. Cus it. takes real talent make person unempathetic people losing businesses. folks commenting tweet talented people.

To last one them, none even fathom solutions worked dozens countries kept people safe. ""Fuck everyone. People get sick die open up, case thought worried business, specifically fuck wearing masks!"" Hospitals get money COVID patients.

Look, think COVID deathly serious listening Fauci re-opening fast. I'm left leaning person thinks Trump bungled this, angle take factually incorrect.

Now evidence whistleblowing actually happening, lying. actually one spreading mis-information ""people gonna die somehow!!!""

\*show excess deaths charts\*

Oh they'll average years. killed weaklings! pretty straight-forward:

The guy bad version spreads days, realizes really spread it.

the guy light version thinks he's little weather, keeps spreading spreading goes work everything else does. executive order enforceable law enforcement. would law already book. real bright Sheriff apparently.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

edit: changed would would Step 1: Asian. Big Gretch. Well are. could numbers possibly worse China’s. It’s Democratic conspiracy make Trump look bad!!!11 /s Cuomo say cause he's afraid NY. NY still getting tourists visitors states best state non-enforceable self-quarantine. Eventually Covid wave make way back Northeast especially colleges start up. inevitable spits face everything NY sacrificed get Covid control. Someone Twitter tonight told narrative whack said deaths spiking again. mentioned April’s numbers, something tells downplayed virus back too. Apparently ban flights. Technically could charged interference aircrew. Less lethal stains spread sick don’t leave house. covid spreading people get sick. 

And yes. That’s masks. still pre symptomatic people spreading it. best flavour, check r/snackexchange.

Only team Leafs. NY already herd immunity? spike there? Covid19 projections site estimates anywhere 10-30% entire population 1.5 million active cases back March deaths happening. Seafood worker again! original cases Beijing Wuhan. Please share data STFU. think people struggle breathe masks morbidly obese. never met anyone car thought allowed public alone, let alone allowed drive car. told symptoms Covid. moving goal posts.  [It's done. Shut Arizona + Confederacy getting hammered

And California. Hopefully bringing control, looking scary Specializes news pertinent Southern border USA tell. McAllen Texas near border. Democrats lying making death count high would look like failure get reelected.

Always one logical leap shy, lol Considering hospitals overrun....yes. Much worse admits defeat lol Idaho, governor ordered testing sites test ppl light symptoms. messed up.  happening keep testing people dead.  One word: winning. fault imbeciles like thinking pandemic lie Given 50% smokers die earlier death due smoking-related illnesses, I'd say Covid19 prevented 500,000 early deaths England. Probably effective public health intervention last 30 years. Ok. could anytime past 6 months asymptomatic though. don’t know 3 days covid. Covid pretty new, cousins (SARS MERS) also pretty gnarly. 

No surprise mean little sucker. bet hold nose jump water huh? RemindMe! 1 month Memory cells textbooks biology major...rather recent finding know answer tried googling found holy fuck fans even allowed? Maybe someone arrested trespassing closed beach? sure referring to. 

We learning go. Outdoor dining thing again. summer camp supposed 100% outdoors people willing staff fully? might confusing businesses choosing hold camp orders it. liberals mention it’s really fucking easy see happening- many died labeled covid, covid deaths + average death rate would overlap. Instead it’s covid + average deaths + 100,000 extra. put perspective, would 9/11-level fatality event, every two days. learned nothing New York. America done. Over. Caput.

The stupid won. stupid won. free testing recently available everyone US / California. Maybe one/two months ago? heard federal government wants stop funding shift responsibility state pay free testings. haven’t follow development again, think that’s tests might slower based available funding / capacity. Florida got caught lying death within past 2 weeks. asked whether 2 people died covid 20's comorbidities rep Floroda said didnt know one didnt comorbidities died motorcycle accident. country world intellectual property rights infringement? United States also classified intellectual property infringing country. blame skull bones. sit neck till stop breathing.

Super simple. Plenty instruction videos r/news. Stupid question: parents can't work home handle online schooling, especially children young enough need adult supervision day? without computer internet access? Kroger, days let enter store. smaller grocer, talk manager refusing entry mask comply governors order (starting five days course state never manages anything timely manner) Fed shoveling money investors increasing wealth inequality... teacher GA completely agree you. Got shouted social media ""let's get back living crowd."" Smdh. caught wishing thing touch deadly...then everyone would take seriously. Well, fair, lot schools won’t open month. Curious, health insurance? pandemic revealing cracks America's social programs lack thereof. Honestly? if? Life would go like always had, except people would keep dying would like ‘huh, that’s weird. six teachers school died month.’ Shit interested going automated checkouts.

I trying argue less lethal variants spread deadlier, like infectious diseases 101.

I idea trying people follow public health guidelines yes, higher lower mortality strain would spread rate stay home we’re sick.

It’s nitpicky refuse engage argument irrelevant discussion.  tell it, although drinking raise blood pressure ruin liver mention immune system. stop that.....take care man. Geez... dramatically month June, 296 deaths reported. Thus far July, 399 Alabamians died COVID-19. worry, put goal posts wheels COVID early morning tearjerker read. hope read weren’t taking seriously least inch recognizing important can. reminds go parroting lines “most mild symptoms” mild symptoms don’t mean risk death.

Also, anyone reading here...get hands pulse oximeter. Learn use use regularly. Even don’t think exposed don’t symptoms. help learn normal notice changes, may help save life.


Edit: Wow, thanks Gold Silver, kind strangers! get check back due work even glad see discussion pulse oximeters options get still looking. Like said, depends live. course racism exists. exists everywhere country extent. saying every ""All lives matter"" sign see 50+ BLM. chittenden county however, likely one progressive areas state.

My day day experience Confederate flags. Half family lives :( one uncles dropped hospital yesterday can’t breathe anymore. whole household sick now, aunt, cousins spouses kids. problem Rio area poverty, lot people living single roof. One gets sick get sick form fashion. least symptomatic person house loss taste smell, critical left hospital yesterday. scared family don’t know it. can't really say US following coherent plan atm. plan everywhere faltten curve initial lockdown, work there. places turned could halt spread altogether, America opened fast exploded. Right one formulate truly coherent plan it. 

Also think much reason highly sceptical herd immunity. Spanish Flu cause herd immunity, infected 25% population. time takes create herd immunity (mind US probably 1% now) virus could mutate strains parts world, leaving immune local one. 

For reasons herd immunity really plausible end game work towards - nothing implying deaths inevitable. spread stopped many countries, reason think cannot countries, stopped spreading outside areas virulent. Like ebola instance. infection rate COVID-19 spread herd immunity world realistic. Doctor Gloom Doom\*

These dumbfucks can't even use expression correctly.  Lol. don’t cause bad breath, finally smells own. 😂 Outside New York, US still starting first wave yeah. states even started yet. That's problem 50 countries counting one, messes data boy. See, thinking people disapprove terrible policies regardless color politician's tie.

Pennsylvania never hospital capacity issue anything approached hospital capacity issue. even true inside Philadelphia, especially case elsewhere. federal policy 5 states (all insane nursing home death rates) this.

Besides, even feds order (they didnt), telling would one recent bit federal health policy Wolf Levine choice follow? Come. On. Listen yourself. first, certainly last. Reporting actual numbers bad business. want do? eat restaurants months? That's absurb! People like focus death rate, plenty people recover still went hell it.

I knew someone knocked ass almost 2 weeks bad symptoms - far serious flu. 

It mild lot people (with people even experiencing symptoms), let fact distract bad be. 

Just die hospitalized mean awful time it. Senate arguing extending UI benefits. Brilliant. ""Biological Ali""?  “Kid gets sniffles falls breaks neck dies. There’s another case!” Sorry ""why took long"" meant difference reaction/searches mentioned article.

If send school, damn thing happen opened businesses early. We'll get significant spike cases end close anyhow. Teachers short supply is, many already considering early retirement this. imagine get lot looking alternate line work, get sick. then? Who'll teach kids?

There plan works since March solidified now. places none.

So maybe try again. Shut EVERYTHING six weeks, everyone get economy schools going again, like done back March. Bafög 860 euro per month nowadays, it? live money pretty right student.

Also, based analogy suppose could perhaps see point masks social distancing necessary, work lockdowns? 

to use examples would consider accidents “cases” driving injury fatalities “Covid deaths. 

When set up, would say “we need airbags seatbelts 3-6 months driving reduce cases deaths.”  vast majority Americans idea Health Industry works. design.

There thing called ICD-10-CM Codes classified ""COVID"" death someone ""positive"" COVID test file. Since testing messed USA someone dies get tested may get posthumously. result get coded ""Pneumonia, unspecified organism	J18.9"".

These nutters think hospitals government slapping COVID anything. suspected CDC prohibits use U07.1 needs different ICD-10 code. would require people actually go real research parrot hear Uncle Ken Ben Masturbatiro

Edit: Changed 100k 10k

Edit 2: count 20 states higher cases per 10k population. Clearly problem nine year old died. amazing one catching sarcasm here.

But even though common stock market rise quickly crisis, spring's recovery inscribed history books, says:

#- Extremely good stocks year

Even one disregards fact middle historic corona crisis, extraordinarily good six months largest Danish companies, since beginning year value addition 17.5 percent.

Bjarne Thomsen points special composition companies Danish C25 index important explanation wild stock market Denmark.

And portion money also ends stock market, help push stock prices upward.


- fear really took hold, lot doubt seriousness crisis response states. since we've seen one coordinated monetary fiscal response never seen before. United States, monetary policy has, among things, meant consumers come crisis money pocket crisis. kept consumption up, forget bit, says.

The truth us ugly already slim chance beat thing gets smaller lie ourselves. [Medical Journal - Infants one outlines pretty well watch porn, seriously. went jail thirty years that. Never would've happened girlfriend there. chances getting coronavirus US LOW! 

I got downvoted...I quoting potus: words beginning. claim American kids choosing quarantine going ""pick friends"" hang out...so applying behavior teenagers 16+ neighborhood entire school - aged population large country. ""genius"" ""local"" figure that's insane generalization. could made Maga Masks printed money. would help people contain disease. 


But no. Cant even that. Doesn’t realize spoke positively virus would disappear? Like miracle?

/s think wise believe everything internet unless there's proof. pictures show recent he's foolish, are. think one food plant listed list lol, one food plant taken precaution since upsurge cases optimism completely gone now. Really it’s long term affects. Deaths awful it’s shown damage lung tissue organs. infection rate much important death rate. really don’t know long term affects going need take like it’s early death maker. person got infected employee training cluster. Apparently standards training employees passengers. heard flight causing cluster yet. 

Not I'm getting plane anytime soon, fuck that! Hmm, let guess party pushed that... much makes civilization successful interconnected things may seem irrelevant. thought education system important help develop men women like Dr Fauci, turns failing teach critical thinking skills rest students greater impact pandemic response does. education system fail many people? breakup traditional family, need parents work longer longer hours survive. contribute able intimately involved education children. brought *those* conditions? need massive overhaul. doubting pick one billion clones Amazon? going get last one sent back day later, wondering settled it. think still first wave. true. live DC work federal government contractor.

Okay, since cowardly answer question, I'll help out. Georgia poorly fight coronavirus. Cases exploding, yesterday 80+ deaths. efforts made previously clearly sufficient, well thought out. That’s comment was. responding said, indicated clue sports still felt need opine. Stay lane. know wearing february? OK sure.

We knew everyone China wearing mask. 

The assumptions made hilarious. forcing back office? law firm, I’d hope see legal recourse situation. :) Heartbreaking. top multitude reasons people eloquently stated you’re wrong also one key difference isn’t apples apples comparison:

Protest = Social Justice Change

Car Race/Rallies = unnecessary Parties ignorant people unlikely distance wear masks begin with.  bit colder part work idiots, EVERYWHERE.  I've saying last three years we're verge civil war. I've screaming abolish partisan system.  average, amount money spent keep prisoner incarcerated US 4 years fund child's education k-12. 5% world's population, 25% world's inmate population. bonus? fucking get it. smh.

I know someone pharmacist local hospital. 

He states hospital paid government COVID patient treat, (and hospitals) marking death could conceivably related COVID ""COVID-19"" - even positive test confirmed contact positive person get paid more. 

I'm sure they're classifying deaths incorrectly. There's grain truth rumor makes harder fully dispel.

You see truth look deaths influenza pneumonia year. They're 3-5x higher years spite fuckery hospitals pulling, we're still reporting deaths. someone runs couple miles mask daily basis.... surprising. news Trump trying buy company provide drug/treatment America Exactly, can't even get people 2 weeks never going happen. peak outbreak drove neighborhood children multiple houses running streets together. Combined 22.10 hour, $42k. Experts warning Pandemic years happened. section society believe seen result. virus R0 value approx 2.5 could take week incubate. (not if) viral pandemic higher R0 (say 5) higher mortality rate going decimated. People react within month everywhere past point stop it. if, people like these. someone would hurry invent technology, could talk to, even SEE people physically you. Perhaps day.  

Oh....WAIT. 3M nationalized converted non-profit, they're going need include list price gougers. Yes, remember COVID mostly killing people chronic health conditions. average COVID patient losing 10 years life, means left behind 10 years worth unused medications. Big Pharma already lost 140,000 customers forever months.

It's pharma company's best interest keep future patients contracting COVID spend another 10+ years buying medications treat cancer, diabetes, hypertension, lung/heart disease, etc., well pills erectile dysfunction unrelated conditions.

Plus, COVID us forever, they'll able make plenty money develop better treatments it, well new drugs treat chronic lifetime conditions millions infected people going live with. if, always plan? UVC answer. dangerous exposed it, obviously. put lamp brake viruses range. However, surfaces biggest issue, IMMO. 330 million / 12 million =27

27*140000= 3.7 million dead everyone got it.

So say herd immunity ... maybe 2.2 million upper limit originally predicted say take coronavirus precautions? wear mask &amp; practice social distancing, going lock away rest life, refuse dine restaurants, visit friends families, let rot isolation unlikely chance get sick twice lol I’m trust me. Ooof. Harsh true. older ladies run cash registers favorite grocery store better equipped, they're better trained? often churches making full children, birth control, illegal abortion. Catholic church lot answer source# oneof6kids 70% ethanol gloves. Let sit least 5 days. agree saying, nothing I'm talking about. I'm saying death rate half early april. I've provided evidence supporting that. think saying death trends seem follow case trends agree with. again, talking wife teacher NJ. Schools opening scared. FIL seems think real walked house bunch stuff wanted drop off. anyone house outside one emergency event May. even shop stores, everything delivery in-store pick up. FIL goes work job sites, hangs girlfriend goes shopping store wants. He's seemed angry we're careful walking fucking house. furious right now. check-out affiliations past publications authors. rabbit hole comically-sketchy science goes deep. Good know, thank you. Funny mention point 1 2, 3. thought dude genius level smart.

Why? personal clearly idiot. Thats setting context study, aka papers results important Anti-vaxxers think repeating lie enough times make true. Still waiting ""vaccines cause autism"" evidence exist. Thanks German bros. Antibody prevalence determined months ago, **between March 23 May 12**, however author news article extrapolates numbers present day, 3.8 million testing positive using RT-PCR (today). inappropriate.

It takes 11 days infected person develop enough antibodies test positive antibody test, time. people antibodies detected study caught virus **mid-March end-April**.

By March 15 3,501 SAR-COV-2 cases detected using RT-PCR, April 30 1,061,028 cases identified, far 3.8 million.

Furthermore, blood samples tested early outbreaks, caught virus proportion testing positive antibodies sill quite low. ranged 1.0% (95% CI, 0.3%-2.4%) CA 6.9% (95% CI, 5.0%-8.9%) NY.

Given antibody tests reliable numbers testing positive low, figures paper likely quite inaccurate. PM'd this. stop-smoking rock star! might case some. I’d bet vast majority refuse wear selfish assholes. think ever reason wearing mask “rights”.  Right thank God live California. least controversial way it.

This question particular: vaccination program prioritize people color, contracted died Covid-19 disproportion numbers?

If/when problems arise first generation vaccine, seem racist tested POC first. wish could say purely political, Florida's case absolutely is. Also considering Ohio next Florida consider good example. reopened way soon, waited long order mask mandate. far Gov. Hogan goes can't speak him. Lmao good luck getting American police jobs Wow. wonder made apologize? would definitely document take pics attorney ready. companies need get line crap tolerated. Well, sensible places did. look election map. Overlap current covid hotspots. see similarities. can’t perfectly safe events? literally said they’re perfectly safe. 

And get mad calling bs? You’re problem country. You’re completely unable see bias. Well partisan b.s. I've ever heard. Yeah, office cultures criminally toxic. 

My wife got argument boss weeks ago co-worker wearing mask office per corporate policy. boss nasty things, told probably go work somewhere else. certain going get fired. next time went work email box apology. 

We documented incident. I’ll surprised company isn’t talking attorney retaliation end year office bosses don’t get shit together. issue COVID hitting pregnant women harder general population getting enough awareness. logic lockdown prevents covid deaths situation anything like vaccine prevents flu deaths. here, Watch this, sooooo much smarter everyone room don’t want waste time looking articles cause soooooooo smart won’t listen lockdown though. That's April saw 20% contraction. finally quarantine yelp horrendous businesses practices/s think US 50 different countries even subdivisions within it. Love idea making masks seem cool heroic. 


Here video made dispel myths around masks.  school offers sports snus-induced wave since June 29, thankfully.

[The seems safe least.  funny aside, campuses parking lots named certain Pfizer drugs-my friend’s spot Viagra one.  wonder many drinking more. know am. loves running photos people beach stories irresponsible behavior.

And interviews people actively encouraging irresponsible behavior, read headline. explanation point plan. bind employers. apply situation thread about. Yeah exactly.

I'm horrified people willing become test subjects recreational activities significant risk infecting thousands others. continues issue, self-centered ""I'm low risk, matter"" attitude.

Vaccines making progress. Can't people hold another year enjoy sports mass gathering events? really important? I'd embarrassed schools even suggest thing, especially current hot spot like Texas.

Other countries shutting public gatherings hundred cases. US thousands daily, shrugs leaves carnage behind them. likely neither he's dead. agree, keep cutting regulations ends food. US shit beef, chicken, vegetables. Actually said read it. Vietnam, Mongolia, countries (never got Vanuatu believe). Possibly states Australia - now. Well ‘mouthbreather’ used insult suggest someone looked stupid primitive apparently there’s lot benefits breathing nose. filters changes temperature air gets lungs. Apparently it’s efficient exercising. breathing expert Joe rogan podcast weeks back found really interesting obviously explain way better could. already back 1k deaths day? see things getting better time soon dreading sending kids back school even considering full time homeschooling. lots friends furious recommendation feel relieved. realize privileged able make remote learning work household wish society could make easier everyone. enough said appalling state testing Arizona last week. They're frequently half typical testing values (8k vs 15k) makes case numbers look good comparison states. reality 62k+ (possibly 100k) backlog saying labs missing reporting cut period numbers added subsequent days. data either going missing huge day cases soon. testing like normal, would easily matching Georgia. testing data today like 27% positive, downright horrible.

If look rt.live, friend DUCE loves, AZ green huge red flag they're testing far less last week. Another reason r0 value, taken isolation, horrible metric.

I want attribute malice something could easily incompetence shortage reagents, testing situation AZ major concern, especially DUCEMASTER wants hit 35k tests 7 days. far deaths seem hidden, makes think serious testing problems AZ. People livid state testing still use every day. Thanks creating this, graphs helped show severity things deniers. Really grateful stumbled across posted it. tragic may it’s much likely got virus another teacher adult building. It’s highly unlikely KG student gave her. viruses like flu exposed immune system adapts it.

Also, even things like measles smallpox dangerous fuck, everyone getting time much population already gotten highly resistant (even permanently disabled it, likely going back hospital second bout illness exposed again). hospitals overwhelmed measles patients small subset people catch given time due prior wxposure vaccine.

For COVID-19, everyone susceptible, even show mild symptoms they're helping spread. true year now, vaccine willing, two years regardless. vaccine path includes significantly less death permanent disability. literally said nothing this. You’re yelling sky. it. Delta exceptional response. Almost 200 daily deaths, 

 let's go, let's get done, 200+ bust Well kinda sucks... Well thank you! job best can. us doing. work great team Desoto. Although get shitty ass pay. ( make less niece manager cake shop). Either way, Desoto great learning hospital nurses helpful doctors always time teach us more! America man.. Land Slavery.. Well, say outbreaks traced protests.

If standing shoulder shoulder outside group thousands shouting protesting safe, surely sitting one seat away fans outside cheering team also safe. NYers care weigh one school opening? I’m different committees WNY one idea doing. feel like going open up, cases go undetected explode. People like reason California cases. gives thrill. Like child refusing eat broccoli, feel control lives. Decades hand washing know big deal majority people could use masks socially distance. Again, stress word ""as"" sentence. Whats ur address? Wait r talking about? warm humid air inside mask act ""humidity filter"", small respiratory particles would hit water particles, effectively converting airborne particles droplet particles. proceed get trapped mask. someone exhaling without mask on, tiny particles make way past mask, still hit moisture barrier inside mask inhaling anyways. particles tiny contain much virus large droplets, mask still give good moderate protection even one else wearing mask, ideally everyone should.

Research humidity virus (influenza personally practice often I'm never disappointed😊  anti masker ever stayed socially distant, scream lije insolent toddler people matter? locking also disastrous effects economy... Thank much. text sent “she’s legit doctor” rolled eyes. Highly doubtful. doctor sends videos one guy claimed invented email. bat shit crazy.  Yes, hospitalizations already severe cases. nature well tracked pretty accurate numbers. study suggests we're much larger numbers asymptomatic minor cases originally realized excellent means lower portion cases lead hospitalizations deaths. people seem suggesting lung heart issues happening COVID patients severe cases too, would worrying I'm highly skeptical that's case. posted... Minnesota governor Democrat FYI. knew symptoms thought congested, got results back also informed. Everyone contact tracing every step way, DOH contacted became upset varying personal reasons.

What could done better? way respond appropriately next time. think murder every 31 minutes US. ~20x people murdered every year. anti-microbial may indeed exactly that, I'm guessing.

Example, plain soap, anti-microbial, effective rna virus bacteria hands. need break surface tension flush drain. hmmm must confused something else resurged antivax people morons thats happened. Deaths lag cases ~2 weeks, also lagging reporting deaths. Anyone expecting what's happening happen next weeks moron saddest part deaths could easily prevented. agree bill get signed. fly drone carrying speaker shouting COVID-19 facts there. school wasn’t requiring students wear masks will. Don’t ask well they’ll enforce it, though. would love know many anti mask morons end getting vaccine. Yeah least keep knees together way support yourself. Jan 2019 outbreak Clarke Co., Washington, unvaccinated child Ukraine brought (amidst outbreak Eastern Europe). 71 people confirmed measles. 86% identified disease unvaccinated. 4% (3 children) received 1 MMR dose (2 doses leads ~97% immunity), vaccination unknown 10% (7 people). 25% transmissions happened church, 51% members household. Clark County vaccination rates 14% lower statewide average.

Fauci never made fighting virus clashes president, also failed miserably COVID-19, viewed sort hero many people sub.

He HERO he's fighting President actively trying make fighting virus political.

Why hard time accepting reality? Mutual friend got bored virus every single person she’s tested positive. boyfriend’s friend jokingly called us “babies” said we’re taking seriously. truly don’t understand know many stupid people. 1. Divide total pop total infected.(328.2m ÷ 4.04m = 81.24)

2. Take number multiply number months since lockdown began. (March thru July = 4 x 81.24 = 325 months

3. Take number divide 12. (325 ÷ 12 = 27 years. 13.5 years reach peak 50%.

It's lowered 30y/15y since last time due rate increasing, factor in. two months ago, could theoretically lower 10% every two months, would come January 2022 50%. Look, reality build temporary hospitals want enough patients virus left grow exponentially. virus MUST suppressed kept exponential increase possible supply chains build anything exponentially, linearly.

Any way look problem best solution lockdown financial support individuals businesses resume normal activity virus suppressed. wanted eat cake too.

The countries reopening suffered quarantine measures impacted economy temporarily, things control started moving again. US tried stay open half assed measures. end result economy *still* tanked huge chunk population withdrew, another chunk stayed got infected wound worst worlds - huge pandemic, slow economy. whatever reason showing internet getting crazy slow speeds showing blank whit screen scrolled down😃 Friend mine died car accident stated died corona ??

Dude border closed non-essential travel months. can't show cross border. Yup. won’t find concrete data there’s way knowing exactly people contract virus. It’s like test say “oh shit; one obtained Applebee’s!” Contact tracing isn’t good.

Totally agree! use common sense. Think virus better chance spreading apply situations locations people likely gather without masks on.

Again, I’d rather stick actual data. Read; Man's authority. Big poppa Mutation Outbreaks 6 restaurants, 6 cases total.

Is different now? NYC. yes die move faster pass around get economy going.

It's amazing anyone thinks this.

1-2% country 140,000 people died. 

If return everything normal, we're talking millions deaths.

The fundamental lack ability basic math consider simple consequences appalling. 

In March, every economist saying pretty much thing. fastest way re-open economy deal virus effectively possible.

What country do? Avoid dealing virus fear dealing virus would bad economy.

It makes sense, unless put context US, people conditioned fear anything public good way. They've told functional healthcare lead communist dictatorship.

Meanwhile Belgium (which one highest death rates per million countries) ... place COVID also raged couple months excellent medical services reached immune level 5.5%. - 

Not dissimilar results come Bergamo (Italy) Sweden... places badly impacted. places results single digit.

I would hope results correct appear much higher comparison numerous studies world.  story people heart attacks home go hospital, committing suicides. accounts tens thousands extra deaths week. Wait, Fox News _the largest_ news channel?!

Others possibly: 

1. weather DK amazing may June, July coldest month long time, somewhat rainy too. Indoor/outdoor seems play large role transmission people spending time indoors July earlier season.

2. Reopening many countries fast. seemed go cautiously start, floodgates sort opened due (imo lax) criteria. special concern reopened areas Sweden start July. new uptick started exactly around time one could start seeing increase cases reopening.

Which also seems reasonable, since mistake made countries. isolated event happened NYC. man comes future 😳😳 we’ve wrong along  left house since feb kekw lose job company run people afraid loud stupid. Sorry. sucks residents affected leaders make choices don’t agree with. pressure declare county green? Fake pews Congrats USA!!! Keep gotta stay #1!!!  Yes, way pandemic handled far means opening schools absolute nightmare. Capiche?  mean Covid lingers longer easily transferable flu? clear got virus plane, time boarding. Someone answer me: masks mandatory throughout city, everything city re-open life go normal, right? long everybody wearing mask, reason anything shut down, right? masks effective, like told are, institution issues re-opening. Sorry loss. Much love. *USA chants intensifies* Ok... let's recap. pretty sure state caps unemployment ***$326 month.*** 

Which correct, state caps unemployment $326 per month. actually 8 states/territories unemployment rate ***326$ month.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

No, isn't. numbers **PER WEEK**, **per month**. 275$ week taxes enough live on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I disagree you, isn't. 

That said, agree not, currently unemployment system intended enough live on; meant *supplement*; *replacement*, lost income. justification additional $600 per week federal government. intent boost unemployment payments fully *replace* income economy closed. economy ""open"" again, feds going either discontinue adjust amount additional unemployment push people go back work. 

Again, agree personally, setup. underestimate election prospects. like base can't see headlines thousands people falling I'll dying, still refuse take basic precautions like wear masks. Working Nasdaq ! also helps pandemic type situation multiple times per decade due population density developed culture work around mask-wearing norm. governments (talking US here) shutdowns reopenings right, would less economy impact way done states (looking Texas, Florida, etc). helped theier leader repeatedly telling real Nursing homes lifted lockdowns sometime end June remember correctly, least San Antonio. course private businesses enforce rules. know someone waiting eagerly lift celebrate elderly father’s birthday two weeks father pass away. don’t know cause won’t ask. There's studies saying people might infectious long, would indicate get within time frame, going get it. 👏👏👏 A+ math

This headline attempting make sound like bad ever been. much worse months ago. 

I’m saying we’re good place! Obviously serious situation, but... perspective.

My argument 1000 lower 2500. I’m sure lose argument. feeling bit stupid, no? matter justifications belong office.  think that? People like reason America right now. everything political, love god.  Kemp learned couple months ago.  foreign agents country agitating instigating. mean, look Chinese government doing. Witness complete failure US!

How got people moon complete mystery.


IDIOCRACY

And reputation gone shit to!

Now wait World Wide travel-ban kick in! right. People expected live lower age birth age 80. 

Even Aus, country article based on, life expectancy 80 9.02 years men. school district poll parents school district. 76% wanted kids attend full time. think it’s mostly parents go work, isn’t childcare open near us parents tired kids. 5 weeks plan send back.  Thank kind genuinely think county/city mask mandates made difference seeing results people maybe getting sick still, receiving less viral load needing medical intervention.

Agreed. shutting / limiting high risk businesses. Problem is, expires 4 days... Yearbooks year include memorial pages student faculty lost coronavirus throughout year. ignorance apathy display generations come. future, used lesson _not_ do. Crack different things different mechanisms. crack virus control tracking without police. Mostly health department media messaging. right crackdowns PROTESTS gone well. crackdowns virus. Two different topics. kid died someone tried playing like that,I would compelled hit them. One many dude. Especially prevented Young people, overwhelmingly lean left, need get shit together. CDC Jesus agrees me. Screaming rooftop NY 3 months, deaths lag MONTHS, August shocking  Remember used joke 'its like ten 9/11s!!""

Or 406000 Americans dying world war 2 changed world. virus care assembled. care social justice. care immortal soul religion. care entertainment.

 Stop gathering public. Stop killing people covid calling social justice. Stop.

You care social justice. people don't. care church religion tribalistic entertainment. don't.

The virus spreads either way. Stay home. Young people going *illegal* clubs. Probably still are.  I'm sure lot good people working hospitals. I'm certain majority front line employees (nurses, doctors) care patients highest priority.

The thing is, hospital obligation make profit. not, it'll close eventually. 

What means, high level hospital administrators, every hospital make decisions kind care going provide. type care money loser, it'll require make money elsewhere hospital. hospital stop providing care, obligation stop providing care. Even care beneficial patients.

Granted, lot people healthcare care want provide great care. change fact hospitals obligated make money, making money going drive lot administration decisions. major conflict way USA's healthcare system setup. IDK manifests COVID, know profit motive drive hospital care decisions. Hopefully small impact.

The bottom line this. hospital provides great care make money, it'll eventually close. hospital provides terrible care yet makes money, it'll remain open. Hospital administrators know drives decisions. identifies decry use mask sociopathic and/or narcissistic personality traits. events keep happening, see mask wearing becoming places, mask-profiling joining racial-profiling major social challenge years come. they're *meats*^TM exceptions rule anecdotal though, timelines based statistics. Obviously outliers could be. could also nature particles could escape sides, even N95 work unless completely covered mouth. Though, compared thin mask virtually nothing, could see face shield work. think would great alternative idiots claiming can't breathe mask got 4 mil 5 months, would take 5 years get herd immunity, using 70% target. America started losing beginning November 2016 Neither one ever necessary, maybe quarantine vulnerable population shutting entire economy preposterous. needs really addressed Americans horrible diet. consume way much sugar meat. readily available sugar pretty much everything. much processed foods. gotta ready go. address Standard American Diet (not coincidence SAD), maybe could get handle obesity.  mean... COVID going away, eventually pandemic slow down. inevitable determined simple mathematics history. We'll better treatments (we already two, maybe three count plasma), vaccines, etc. infecting people rest lives, extent people vaccinated cannot go back living like 2010s. widespread vaccination cases plateau long time, 100% expect sports, concerts, gatherings, full restaurants etc. start back again. Personally think everything fully open around time next year !remindme want - though may wearing masks good while, least infections slow complete crawl everywhere. also believe generation-defining event change society forever cause many take future pandemics much seriously.

The big issue right nobody full immunity therefore spreading like wildfire. next years I’d think. argument .. though administration complicated. suppose use 2019 tax return (which everyone filed now). Clickbait title. California many people NY. Per capita nowhere close. Oh please choice, used fat turd got it, 100% choice also username 0 credit Unfortunately everyone gets seasonal flu vaccine. always shame don’t (the people without valid medical reason skip course). Also can’t include possible flu strains vaccine regardless natural immunity helpful well. would mean 2,750 children die FL public schools alone. OK that? Damn criticize take read username Ah, sounds like it’s ‘bless heart’ situation we’re joke... That’s cultural norm. That’s propaganda food industry themselves. Quantum Chemistry believe. Lol that’s ridiculous 

Any R value 1 results exponential growth... person gives 1 person exponentially increase! great. infected disease? awesome. maybe who's interviewed. Fauci said control?

Trump seems say every single day people die though. someone get stupid? Logmarithmic way look data like this. Linear easy misread good news. He’s also said repeatedly trump taken advice implemented suggestions.

Really gets noggin joggin... Yep, person willing assign experts task move forward; would support consider lucky wise leader. Haha still many men say 😈 tone top blame NY Covid death capital Earth?And Minneapolis reporting like 1k new cases daily?  even that; 25% may like it, mandate government store, STFU wear one. assholes making noise. wrong protests. definitely virus spreading happening there. 

But take step back understand magnitude thing. protests died outside handful areas. Even protests happening, dealing smaller subset population participating, mostly urban locations.

Eating restaurant drinking bar happening almost everywhere, continues happen outside locations indoor dining shut down. lot people going eat/drink overall participated protests...it get media coverage exciting eventful.

Moreover, impossible wear mask eating drinking. And, we're talking indoor vs. outdoor, makes huge difference.

Don't take mean I'm discounting protests saying factor spike - probably do. naive think everything else happening indoors playing even larger role. I'm saying, want feel morally logically superior go right ahead keep calling idiots. actually want see change, civil it. people extreme enough able change minds, goal change minds many reduce spread much possible. willing talk kind level. human even disagree you. thinking cocoa puffs no, right now, would let U.S. travelers in. ban border vast majority U.S. travelers. covid owes us 4 million subscriber special could even sold MAGA masks made even profit getting supporters actually follow expert advice once. slam dunk, continue thinking smartest man world use gut feeling fox news advice instead. Herd immunity dangerous, unethical, unwise strategy pursue novel virus whose parameters largely unknown. Especially said parameters include questions long immunity lasts, one get reinfected within relativity short period time, reinfection like. parameters many left long term disability. whether virus cause persistent infection. Imagine we'd tried ""herd immunity"" HIV. 

Even eventually turn way we'd like / hope to, herd immunity still involves sacrificing many lives pursuit it, lives could saved suppression / Test, Trace, Isolate model. response? vein. recommended. problem infants dude. people socializing public areas spiking lockdown sight real enforcement mask use. Cheers! 4 months whole family got seven year old still breathing issues 5 year old fine think..myself wife suffer reoccurring fatigue fevers circulation issues us high level athletes preexisting conditions,the 5 year old obviously active. I've 2 hour meetings could couple short e-mails. cancers added up, feels like cheating, 1600 per day USA, indeed Covid19 deaths USA right now. less Covid back April. also likely surpass next month stay knows long.

Cancer could seen bigger problem, luckily cancer contagious. kids, teachers school staff part 0-18 demographic fool. sent die. benefit signing keep idols feeling like cannot use them.
You far mark much write, hesitate say ""act desperation"", simply fight numerically superior enemy. US refrained using weapons fought smaller conflicts scale could handle.
The US engaging military expeditions produced mixed result. least 1991, actions key winning Cold War. expense part business. ones since somewhat detrimental, people vastly overestimate significance.
The real issue poor trade, economic, fiscal, industrial, environmental polices resulted de-industrialization US allowing China become economic superpower almost overnight. US competent leaders (and nothing red/blue issue, parties complicit), fall USSR 1991 would marked start phase II Cold War defeat eastern bloc power, foolishly thought buying China's crap would fix everything, called ""Washington consensus."" wrong. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Holy fuck. idea Germany size Montana. Unfortunately, probably never recover.... organs compromised long.... he’s looking transplants early death.... sorry wet mop. level repression astonishing. lights bit minds happen, still continue. I’m really amazed people understand sarcasm. Tells everything need know subreddit. whole time thought Putin pee tapes really Coronavirus did. Accept wins, ouch cringe, DNC repeat mistake again. believe Biden bag, one second u/estonianman u/Guncriminal positive note. death test result come back, die covid. remember back March accused wanting “police state” said Australian guy went work (Hobart Hotel) clubbing awaiting covid test results (ultimately positive) should’ve monitored fined.

Obviously I’m sympathetic people work take away ability 10 people work didn’t listen isolation instructions went partying potentially spreading Covid? may believe virus, cuz virus believes you... Yeah there’s federally mandated sick leave. sure particular states live NYC it’s mandated city. It’s one things you’re lucky enough work good company (which do) sick leave vacation provided. I’m allowed unlimited company generous. Basically you’re mercy generosity employer many things basic rights countries, course primarily screws people least afford screwed. Insurance, hand, pretty terrible regardless insurance companies cartoonishly evil. Even you’re insured look possible way deny coverage sometimes think something covered deny claim get massive bill. even happened recently covid test! billed $200 blood sample collection even though covered lab work itself. claimed went urgent care non-urgent testing something 🙄  heard one yesterday couple good friends.    would want wear mask? forced watch speech Dick Devos. Showed pictures brand new factories china, told great was. Fauci's response timeline we're working Relatively easy minimize even though thousands die yearly, yet we're going beyond virus randomly popped 8 months ago  True enough. I've never big fan people Texas Florida come Colorado college. They're often rude usually terrible driving winter. they're packing Coronavirus. state precarious position cases could skyrocket we're careful, fear schools trying open pushes us past threshold. whole GOP like that. bit part reason still coordinated federal response pandemic. cannot admit serious, Democrats say serious. get, best, half measures. Summer 2021 guess well Well 100% limiting risk impossible choose live fantasy world.

It’s weighing cost vs. benefit and, case protests, believe benefit outweighs cost. doubt list exhaustive. Still, answer question. one best? metric best? evidence thinking is? hope so, point looks like matter vote won’t accept it. What's really crazy fact Donald Trump's dad Fred Trump emotionally damaged losing dad early 1919 plague. damage came full 360. It’s likely Canadian snowbirds returning Florida going back forth. Canadian citizens still allowed cross States. Well, DUH Shocked nobody 500+ comments posted entire article lol I'm willing bet y'all get past headline either Secret police. Much better.  1 that's false 2 make choice eat said food..... Really hill wanna die on? seems like quite bit state think *that* densely populated. hope able get control soon. negligence held morally, legally, financially responsible wearing masks major issue terms public safety consequence. bunch evidence showing help, good idea. like giving drugs totally untested unknown effects something similar high risks. literally one least inconveniencing things do. 

whether masks politicized bearing whether good idea not. idea someone could spread less virus wearing mask less important ""its damn Democrats trying control me"", believe rationality general care fellow people gone window.

If seatbelts mandatory meaning effective, put air bags? traction control? bumpers absorb impact collapsing? use 2-factor authentication online accounts passwords mandatory? super effective not, effectiveness actions stack top other. Staying home dont need paired wearing mask going effective staying home dont need out. course people need go sometimes, appointments, work, groceries, etc. Nobody saying masks perfect, dont good impact. Obviously people wear wrong lot, one properly half time still better all. world deal absolutes. 

Certain actions effectiveness certain circumstances. Packing people stadium long wear masks, thus making ok, like driving car 200 km/h ok seatbelt on. faster drive, less effective seatbelt saving life. make better seatbelts faster cars. Large indoor gatherings push limits effectiveness actions. end, social distancing staying home best action cannot done pack stadium. mom went insane rant yesterday virus “disappear November 4th! democrats trying take Trump four years!!!1” 

You know, every country world acting global cabal Trump... 

I’d say don’t follow hoax logic, it’s absent logic begin with. 

Edit add: bonus, lives Florida course doctor far know still bit risk person HBP real risk people take anything it.

Remember comorbidity death sentece, even extremely old people 80% chances surviving course tons people HBP survived :) Let's honest, rioting protesting probably helped either. hardest hit places Democrat areas. That's toxic positivity action. Fyre Festival organizers fell victim that. *Brett Kavanaugh entered chat* live area. poorest sickest population country. also low education level area. majority population obese class 1 higher (very high morbidly obese occurrence). government leaders trying implement shelter place orders hold without state leadership. think predominantly Hispanic population, would concern thy neighbor. Nobody cares. much ""If get sick, either hospital helps, die"". friends family health care workers, struggling keepnit together. ok here. get relief aid need. people understand take action. People know dying left right. Numbers across state starting plateau understanding. case here. They're skyrocketing. IKR.. dont see anyone could hate trump point. .he hero! 4 years Youre right prove anything one believes shit one ever prove it! That’s lovey. I’m taking states took serious low numbers spikes despite everyone Reddit screeching it.  so? NYC problems months ago, they’re better. Minneapolis reported like 6 new cases yesterday. Good job DeSantis. He's proof everyone goes Harvard Yale smart. put room decent ventilation. Make sure person masks on. come necessary. Hope best. Math hard average US citizen. science.. basic language skills...

We probably revamp education system. PLEASE trolling us. hurts brain think may people actually dumb. Yea lets open schools. dr claimed safe open schools tv last week use masks Denmark tho. Maybe months. export economy may well shut along main market. Anyone dares opinion attacked demonized unless ""right"" opinion. anyone surprised people afraid speak true opinion? says COVID-19 worse Ebola.   I'll take COVID-19 herd immunity Ebola herd immunity day. kidding.

Thankfully, governors making masks mandatory, vaccine/antibody tests going rather well (especially ones Oxford) Trump finally embracing masks (albeit increase re-election chances) may gain upper hand months. 

Granted, almost certainly get worse gets better. personal responsibility

This start lose people. 24X would nice things would likely go away rate, use link below's website models seem fairly reasonable me. estimate far virus hit 10% population  
 liberal coworker asked thought ""suspicious doctor fowchi guy"" told shut listen doctors scientists. 9 deaths/day country never lockdown! Schools, offices, restaurants everything open mandated masks either! never Swedes quite healthy overall? Like much obesity resulting underlying conditions? Wat?  Walmart doctors office more. hospital work bought out, ran while, shut favor deal made medexpress move here. Chemically alter, ie cook? lol imagine realizing Germany population eight times Sweden mean technically started it, complaining. also wasn’t complaining, telling trifling. there’s nothing hypocritical never acted like time valuable take millisecond tap comment closed. fact, you’re one you’re accusing of, ironically Federal government needs simply provide non-rich parents money. Stop funding closed public schools. Instead give parents money directly hire private tutors. Even online private tutoring small group better teacher trying wrangle 30 kids internet. US unemployment rate high. Let industry experts jobs teach children know. It'll better everyone. No, still effective stopping spread. Covid spread respiratory particles l, catching spit something. Headline incorrect. Deaths Florida 287 last 24 hours. 

173 year round residents. 114 year round number Florida resident deaths reached 5,518, increase 173 since Wednesday’s update. Another 114 non-Floridians died state.  changed mind, serving size? Typical US thinking. Easy cures. want real solution? Go back quarantine, slowly open society make 5 feet distancing mandatory. Masks help, bit. they're miracle cure.  would want wear pants? warm would much comfortable go naked waist down. people see trashy, I'm likely leave germs place, I'm decent person. 

If try argue wear pants public, masks.

No one cares *want* none personally anything public health. Really tired snowflakes thinking they're special need special treatment can't comprehend putting cloth mouths. Well say anything. buy police badge city online. buy old police cars auction well Lmao it’s thing reddit highlights. Literally every time fat person dies sub simultaneous stroke orgasm. 

It’s really gross actually.

For bunch basement dwellers reddit usual hatred far people. Even obese 20somethings don’t usually drop dead 24hrs. Confused this. valves mask front mouth, along cheek. breath, droplets move forward mask making u-turn trying reach valve. point comparison, poll years back found 20% Americans didn’t know earth orbited sun. pretty much sounds like he's talking saving masks ill healthcare providers.. exactly talking about. think people believe possible actually control Covid-19. fundamentally disagree people.

Nature’s method population control often infectious diseases. see high concentrations animal populations see highly concentrated cities. 

It arrogant believe fully control escape world live in. requirements face mask? neck gaiter/snood job? come everyone reddit addicted fear mongering alarmist ideas.  Fucking. Obviously. Social anxiety complex issue. Also, seem learned lesson experience. Chicken week days, Covid church days  Worse flu? trends coronaviruses do, become slightly worse cold. Rename “Trump Presidency mode: scientists fired, research defunded, conspiracy theories started spread help successful”. Stasi boring. like think it’s hoax otherwise overblown/not bad media makes be. won’t take seriously someone close gets hurt. hope: vaccine gets approved distributed need front line workers winter kind normal

My question: what’s main mode distribution vaccine ? Surely can’t walk physician office crowding. possible drive throughs? Obama 6'1 he's tall Trump maybe even taller

It’s blatantly obvious I’m sure there’s much resistance. think that's common lament expert, ever. lack lockdown Sweden economical reasons. 

These experts always [alluded economy strategy. think media thrilled crisis pin Trump. think media wants draw crisis till election day. they're pushing keep kids school. they're agitating second lockdown. they're stoking fear maximum extent possible.

There cabal. media strongly Trump 2016, they're strongly Trump now. They're hyping coronavirus like hyped Trump-Russia collusion story. can't stay home, wear damn mask! good someone knows basic academia head country vs someone knows businesses. Fabric masks exponentially better mask. really trying keep people breathing other. Even N95 shit facial hair. Nobody shaving daily this. negative help mitigate viral load one may receive infected sure would work great reusable respirators like 3m 6200 model. example - recommended shave beard using kind respirator otherwise seal leaks little. still talking marginal leak, use cases (vary contaminated indoor areas like ER) may important. job nurse practitioner bill Medicare? don’t believe you. 
 
Hospitals get paid death Covid patient. It’s thing. think fraction second would realize preposterous notion is.

Mass civil unrest. Bread lines. Overdoses suicides. doorway draped flowers florists small country hand. silence speechlessness ignorant selfish fellow humans Sure. China ton countries balls, so...we see say.  [http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks\_lit\_review.pdf](http://files.fast.ai/papers/masks_lit_review.pdf) review literature offers evidence favor widespread mask use reduce community transmission:   Models suggest public mask wearing effective stopping spread virus compliance high.

 Figure 6, green (successful supression daily growth and/or reduction peak) areas show April 10, 2020, **an overwhelming majority countries regions best managed COVID-19 outbreaks countries regions either (1) established universal masking cultures** (2) mandatory orders government recommendations supported significant early mask production destined general population.

But yea, masks *totally* help stop spread. IIRC receptors virus nose, mouth less likely receive virus. Also something eating makes likely bind receptors mouth.

[CDC says ""there evidence suggest handling food consuming food associated  working sick sacrificing *other people's children* get sick cannot work.

Yes. lot people know this, understand this, feel bad this.

But refusing go work carries risk homelessness.

If families homeless, exactly supposed stay home?

You're saving lives creating homeless people. solution people stay home matter consequences even consequences result losing home insist remain in.

Do understand solution undoing goal? 

We need functioning government provide safe way people infected self quarantine. this. Tuberculosis absolutely problem, global scale, roughly 1.5-1.8 million people die globally every year. 

But pointless say ""look *that* bad thing, *this* bad thing matter"". 

By way, tell friend people died U.S. *yesterday* died tuberculosis preceding *year*. might global problem, domestic cases. last 10 years U.S. roughly 10,000 cases/500 deaths per year tuberculosis. 

Anyway, good luck reaching friend sounds like they're pretty deep. he’s giving wvery meeting im guessing complied? curious, livestock disease eradicted? downvoted. agree. Wearing mask social distancing 1-2 years one thing can’t forever. ok I'm sure families 9,183 died Germany, 30,182 died France, feel same. selfish. Well, that's said kind bit good news (as ""good news"" relatively speaking, considering we're midst pandemic) kids 10 effective spreading disease. Based article, 19 20 kids 10 catch spread it. that, combined masks, social distancing, parents working remotely hopefully help keep spread check.

You're absolutely right though, significant risk involved. there's also certain harm sending kids school too. win school starts, 100% guarantee purple level 

!RemindMe 80 days

I feel like probably right, I'm always curious see people's predictions play out. Show called anyone names spread misinformation. wrong. Deaths go up, cases stay 10k per day till September, watch. 🤔🤔🤔 test backlogs tracked? Would interesting see if/how backlog growing.  C'mon people, wear damn mask! Help beat virus regain freedom us all. don't, beginning thread stated cannot find said article wondering anyone else seen thing. kinda black mirror shit this... That's NJ restrictive private businesses. #1 rated golf course country NJ, also exclusive play at. Blowing breath God attendees proven ineffective Welcome Miami Lol @ septics word. feel like already has. I'm right you. big deal brushed rug \*continues cycle complaining people complaining\* legalize drugs destroy black market. take care lot take billions spent policing drugs focus education treatment. President needs put nationwide order arrest protesters next month two. second wave directly correlates protests. It’s western thing. Western culture places individual societal needs. advantages innovation it’s clearly inferior eastern societal individual needs pandemics. I'm you, things hear people start bitching blaming others reasons wear mask. everyone, get it, need careful. Wearing mask political issue looking other. Jesus.  makes lose live. Go look NYt whole USA case chart. hit 300,000 dead halloween. let’s open schools see happens. you’re Texan hasn’t contacted Governor Abbott TEA yet, please so. you’re non-Texan concerned Texans dying, please contact governor voice concerns. lengthy edit even for? currently 5 replies none negative. Spain seems beginnings second wave bump. According Worldometers, gained 2,600 cases today, successive days 1,000's, Barcelona could locked again. surprising. Spain reopened tourism. people start traveling going back normal, know cases increase, followed deaths. going stop-start affair keep cases manageable trying function normally possible. Countries like Japan, Australia Israel already second waves. talking people make bread people get high lot? Actually, nm, probably answer either case. really bad math lol. 

If need 132 million infections herd immunity, IFR 0.6, comes 792,000 deaths. 

If we’re around 40 million cases ~6 months, it’ll take year get rest way. end next summer. 

And that’s assuming started thing 0% immunity protection; emerging research covid T-cells suggests there’s already significant portion population that’s protected (to extent). about? error overestimated number deaths accidentally, putting worse position Laugh Ugandan 1000+ cases zero deaths. Govt figures fyi. Don’t get wrong. completely agree there. never set good example. Even everyone around safe. should, least, wear one solidarity.
However, president setting poor example likely small part cases prominent. free... article referring amount government agreed pay shots. calls NYT leftist sickos yep least Dads Leaf Blowers! Welp, seems like well thought responses criticizing democrats considered ""incivility"" subreddit. think final number going shocking people. wonder using anonymous user data get insight much social distancing practiced particular area. 
They list ‘other’ factors calculations...that could anything. theory works, always work practice. going low priority call police, might take 15 30 minutes get here. going calling police constantly, attitude might empathetic towards store. filter pollen, forest fire smoke, pollution air breathe even virus? *wouldn’t* want that? Well schools closed, teens still meeting spreading it. see groups teenagers everywhere parks etc. point keeping schools closed? Atleast school, forced socially distance. Random question, actually refer someone doctorate degree? I've normally heard PhD. guess makes sense, calling doctor philosophy, I've never heard way. news article, academic report. Well yeah course.  China best hope humanity, go China! states data distributions centers. Michigan lists daily totals tests returned positive result prior 24 hours, however, also show data far positive cases actually tested, turnaround time is, date symptom onset began symptomatic cases. guys realize scam. actors agenda. Watch downvoted oblivion, reddit also heavily censored like main stream media!  Feel free post articles. Well, regent, I'd say reasonable conclusion OP saying meant ""regent"" figuratively. Elon musk said something similar Joe Rogan back Hell could said Chinese Flu Patriots wear masks make America great free PR. Trump sabotages everything aims do. Anything Trump touches dies.

His father's fortunes inherited. casinos. Trump steaks. Trump U. Trump airlines.

Now comes brilliant idea: Trump TV that's going bigger Fox. Trump lose election, go back ranting government, end jail.

But no, Trump screw one chance peaceful old age. become poster man-child Republican do-nothing GOP incompetence. lack lockdown Sweden economical reasons. response led CDC equivalent, politicians.  Well certainly interesting. chewed pencil graphic genius. 

You imagine abbott trump, etc. chewing pencil, staring ceiling deep thought, stumped simple algebra question. deaths mount. Figure out, dummy! answer ceiling! Everyone’s begging cheat person next you! Copy Cuomo’s paper! Copy Italy’s paper! Etc.  comparing apple orange 


What's mortality rate 2? contagious covid? stay hidden sometimes 14 days ?

Also 

Small pox measles still exits many 3rd world countries those, additional 120 deaths.

The worst school shooting Florida ""only"" 17 dead. 10 times AVOIDABLE Good catch! quite silly excuse use juncture epidemic winding down. 

I guess pulled reflexively that's he's used excuse many past errors. join effort make something mediocre happen keep getting worse future—even help get better. r/QualityOfLifeLobby Based results Nordic countries, masks hardly necessary handle effectively. Much better directing small leak towards glasses lazy properly fit mask hole front mask designed let much air fast possible allowing quite bit spread.

A facing exhalation valve different breathing downward facing nose without mask it.

Getting excited share qualifies tell experts wrong.

[Educate first though. suspect applicable qualifications talking fair, also getting better treating it. age cohort people getting lower; lot nursing home spread early days NYC. possible, unlikely. Unfortunately people charge decision really care people affected think. Opposed many would die going schools? many children okay dying drive car? Definitely. it’s crazy lot people given 600/week bare minimum, reality that’s almost twice minimum wage workers (or higher, made $450 week 14 hour minimum wage state 8.75) it’s obvious there’s massive disconnect people making laws people making sure everything runs well (essential workers). truly gut wrenching, normal blue collar workers disrespected looked upon Wow, stupid... good know. Thanks another screenshot! Like said before... think speak. country ""wiped out"".   didnt mention antifa terrorists, biggest threat right covid spreading riots. hope feds show place friend got tested June 23 serious symptoms. got results 48 hours, took 96 hours, despite taken location one hour apart other. us negative. lingering painful cough ever since convinced false negative. wife also got shortness breath (which isn’t uncommon asthma, naturally large breasts weigh put weight chest/lungs, currently pregnant). OB wanted get tested. got tested 10 days ago still doesn’t results. got antibody test six days ago due cough it’s negative. pretty much know never it, likely bronchitis, doesn’t either, yet it’s 10 days gotten antibody test, would never know. also got tested place three weeks apart. turn around gone 48-96 hours 12-14 days. People could get days infected go full round covid recovering getting results saying “yes it.” “Great, would’ve nice know actually it, now...”  !remindme 2 months

!remindme 2 months  don’t think it’s going get better soon. Said children. Yeah, guess thermal cameras everywhere employers know may need spend days fever clinic case, makes sense.

Technically can, smallpox eradicated measles almost non-existent countries good healthcare, they're contagious. took lot time efforts though.

However, diseases human-only, reports SARS2 infecting cants, dogs, minks - jump back humans (or spread bats humans) makes shit zoonotic, good luck eradicating it.

FTFY enough tests due surge many states. They’ve already diverted 80% tests northeast various southern states Texas Arizona hard hit Florida likely capped testing ability.  little frustrating highlighted more.

Obesity preventable reversible. could using tragedies really push population towards better metabolic health, countless benefits beyond pandemic risk.  Coughing fit led losing control car. Definitely Rona. governor fail mandate masks, actually mandated ""No Masks"" cities.

If people without masks come anyway, store employees stay away, close register, go safe room, perhaps even call police.

It still hasn't.

I notice he's stopped talking predictions failed many times even fans buy them. America country made rich.

The founding fathers rich landowners owned slaves. Washington paid useless virtue signalling ""Yeah slaves, promise fully agree slavery!"" like rich people today think they're nobble preach causes actually never adhere to. give single shit common man. US remained ever since. maybe...

FL.USA! FL.USA! true, even SMBs generally think “big corporations.” dad owns small business industry WFH possible, it’ll choice make. Lay staff? Close shop? Go bankrupt? 

Small businesses don’t normally keep huge stockpiles cash, even backup money nobody baked six month shutdown business plan. wonder long take us go 4 5 million.

Given many states rationing tests long taking get results back...

Our confirmed positive count really way saying, ""This represents testing capacity.""

Our real positive number unknown likely 5 million. I’m saying corporations support addiction need held accountable. made food healthier regulations people would lose weight. That’s truth Testing actually dropping many states desperate tests now. Total shitshow.   Lol couldn’t scammed Ontario we’re averaging 20k+ tests day So, 173 new deaths appallingly high positive new cases, rough daily estimate deaths say, 2 weeks? reading comments thread effectively pointed top 5 coronavirus countries Europe combine deaths lower population US. problem numbers steadily climbing far less deaths per day, take long flip stat. Europe much denser US, making tougher fight contain virus. Source?  think mostly stems options. way mainstream liberal news sources mainstream conservative news sources. liberal sources combined one two stations could overtake Fox news... Maybe Ew. Enough  Agreed, I'd wager vast majority people feel way. r/coronavirus echo chamber specific type person, represent people all. really think they're taking minorities away *educated*? want take away points (because large agree you), statement made want vomit. ignorant. many love logic trying avoid second wave making first wave bad possible human race might remain. Even nuclear winter population density drops low enough places still survivable.

The human civilization know though, would gone good. actually given viruses work, even nothing still get spike followed stuff going down. can't go ""lol going must something right""

The 562 dead per million makes crystal clear they've done wrong right fair share. majority. Thank god We're probably going see another 1,200+ deaths day today. Universities/Colleges know online courses perceived less valuable students (aka consumers) in-person classes. offer many in-person classes possible, knowing likely shut endangering students, faculty staff, fully online semester means lawsuits drastic reduction tuition costs. impressive! 1200 bed hospital like 10 days? real hospital, tents.

Back February, YouTube channel (Wendover Productions) video construction hospital. certainly worth Gotta give break. probably found pandemic. Well, since hospitals full turning away sickest patients, three thirds saying it’s control? Dumbest thing... far. Exactly, closer one gets healthy weight, less one likely health problems associated higher BMI. Every bit helps try best yourself. Lizard people seems poll well, close runner 5G and/or Bill Gates.

There’s many choices help keep nothing takes care itself. No, wrong... USA 2nd worst death rate per 100k (ignoring UK don’t report per population, method inflated NO! Watch video starting 4:50 Ya, it’s like established shorthand get around issue hearing someone’s tone reading comment /s town nj getting us results 15 min bet Rona mimicking flu, bet wrong. pot committed can't afford close anything down, again.

 literally putting everything going away vaccine appearing burns down. Today 131 me. Life weird days it’s never worth giving on. know I’m stranger internet ever need ear, I’m great listener. Hang there; get better! Try critically think; exhale droplets magically flying little valve majority smacking inside mask sticking like cloth mask doctors gave extra points. lie tell. thousands already signed up, willing free. absolutely family structure. People unable raise children without help strangers expect society pick failings children. fun thing pandemic cases rise, number deaths well (it takes time get sick suffer die).

Here Canada control pandemic, Texas COVID19 running rampant, GOP governor still reluctant tell people simple things, like wear mask (masks manly, Trump taught us that)

Have fun stats, watch number deaths start increase, fun, fun, fun... mitigation scenario 100% general population infected well, mortality 0.5% range. parents school-aged children probably similar low age much lower mortality. teachers 0.5% likely. 3.7 million teachers US, we'd expect bit 20,000 die.

A mitigation scenario dependent reopening schools, however. goal everyone get sick teachers probably die regardless. Lol wow Twitter is...really something. amount vitriol scientists doctors getting people saying politically motivated fucking depressing. always check numbers around UK, 8pm. 

The last ALWAYS 35k cases 400 deaths time. point I'm fully expecting numbers point day.

Today almost 43k cases 600 deaths. would assume people sub brain capacity something whip phones record person calling names.  blame inept government response blame idiots getting hair dyed blame both. That’s common thing people say justification numbers overinflated. Chill fuck out. hopefully share prison cell future gross negligence. actually extremely good news satire? “Up to”

Just make $2000 flat see things change. non-strict language are. Yeah penalties harsh, better losing lives. Netherlands “less half” deaths Sweden? 6,158 people died Netherlands, total numbers Sweden, per capita 357/million, less half Sweden (at 557/million) measure either. 

Someone else mentioned US, stand said.  Stupidity seasonal? coronavirus potentially something would eventually live permanently?

This one pandemic, future wild animal populations come contact humans encroaching last bits natural habitat left around world.

Once cycles climate change, diseases, war, drought, etc... really start going ride gonna get truly wild. live Houston now. I’m going ride capital again. 😉 Nobody knows yet. Trumps doctor  Yikes. promote unhealthy lifestyles. like mannequins I've seeing getting bigger bigger. Everyone see new normal. 

I figured good weight going Japan, realised big was. I've since last 15lbs 3lbs healthy weight. perception obesity screwed America think obesity 600lbs everyone else chubby whatnot. plenty great Americans skills education many countries would happy have. Incoming brain drain! Feeling normal. minor fever (100.3), body aches, chills, tiredness, cough. Felt like typical cold. Unfortunately one people contradicted (50 year old male) passed away days ago. TBD - dog. “That hard test take, think aced though” Nah, already hopeless ""coordinated leadership"" Yeah guy cooking food, guy packaging food guy handing food touch one could possibly give rona. one less touches one less chance rona germs. Please quantify difference droplets exhaled cloth mask valved mask Seems White House trying hide numbers bad job it.  Yeah there’s least one death got recorded wrong, things aren’t bad look, surely there’s truth exact story friend friend getting test results via mail bailed covid line waiting exactly two hours. call arrogance.

This call selfishness. People dying over, losing jobs, houses, etc boomer selfish generation like concerned affects them. Oh able travel, go see nice places abroad.

You like generalizations? guess disagree. teach children absolutely it. Alternatively, find new ways structure schools it’s doable proposition. It’s one thing many countries world safely successfully. plenty places look inspiration. think throwing hands giving indefinitely real option.  Buy retirement property cut rate prices, move years, safe. I'm statistician upsetting much bullshit time takes correct would take months. new wave bullshit would come act like never said deaths would stay ~~100~~, ~~200~~, ~~500~~, 1,000 per day. 

The saddest part people peddling bad statistics actually bright people, pre-covid world, would hired trained become good data analysts researchers.

But are, excel charts neon lines grey background pumping shit... biggest problem naive health data see conspiracies anyone worked public health sees natural problems decentralized under-funded health system human data collection error. 

They often complain understanding definitions statistics, even bother looking up, flat make definitions someone calls it. used clean data college homework, realize human data really messy slow produce.

I really know watch world burn around me. No, i'm reading paragraph says ""The lifetime chances dying accidental drug poisoning one 71 2018, compared one 608 car accident one 180,746 fatal injuries caused lightning."" According archived chart page linked to, ""All motor vehicle accidents"" includes 28% car accidents, 28% pedestrian fatalities, 44% motorcyclists (of children would extreme minority) can't use whole thing number. Let's forget adults car way often minors. math incredibly off.

All described avoid car accidents realistic, though I'm able work home fill tank since March compared usual amount twice week, maybe now. Educating kids outside school something i'm also able do, i'm it. No, understand. Electronics necessity, predicated rare earth metal mining, fundamentally destructive environment exploitative labor; get choice owning using electronics want live normal life modern society, alternative nothing short massive systemic overhaul world's economic governmental structure . much choose buy chicken sandwich company branded bigots continues support bigoted beliefs. press conferences would better least know way? amount compassion

Yeah haha oh well 

One country united? One country ready eat neighbor drop hat come isn’t homeless people caught virus ? Floriduhian, many things wrong government taking control pandemic. governor far president's ass opening schools, letting rally, opening tourist theme parks. shut everything month, many months ago would better place. look us 10k+ average day still proceeding nothing issue. Life Floriduh crazy, really fucking crazy! Yeah, right decision hindsight. Maybe known virus time decision made, see previous response. embarrassing yourself. central air recirculating virus throught whole building, even 6' away virus could carried right  rely chick fil sauce provide flavor. Popeyes miles better anyway. Lol actually right damn Interesting enough Chicago area holding steady 4-5% positive rate.


Where Illinois seeing increases positive rate Southern regions. Governor split state 11 different regions folks outside city South feel needed follow rules Chicago. Governor created regions satisfy complaint.


http://dph.illinois.gov/regionmetrics


East St. Louis specifically seeing increase. That's ok though, right? right position authority still reap rewards? mask help outdoors Ina dense crowd?   Canadians getting 2000/month (~1500USD) comes countrymen still jobs...because, that’s good people nation. Yup. Might gallon soda day, might discovering holy shit serving size nuts tiny 

Jesus Christ totally eat 1000kcal cashews sitting. They’re like depleted uranium food. dried fruit. olive oil. Hell cutting oil food 50% definitely affects taste might save 200+ calories day. Especially Italian cooking. swear Italian food 80% vegetable volume, 50% olive oil calorie. 

God damn want good spaghetti gravy right now.  conclusion Trump administration, especially Coronavirus crisis (is crisis strong enough word?) problem America Americans. Trump's approval rating still somewhere 30 40 percent. LOT people continue approve watched 150,000 Americans die dear leader tweeted racist bullshit, lied national television, played golf, sent federal agents violently crush peaceful protest. country fundamentally broken, point matter time fails. hope worst generation dies does, people left responsible enough save it.  case anyone wants throw buck hat cause. Ah yes, Dr. Trump Administrauci Thank you. seems like falling correlation imply causation trap. Sun Belt states experiencing uptick summer; conclude therefore seasonal.  Problem gives hypothesis would so.  Bright hot sun southern latitude. Maybe uptick due season? level boat knowledge matches username. words...

username checks I've never casino thought filthy/ dirty, even fancy, high-end, upper scale ones like Wynn Bellagio. stains, smells, etc. They're barn people say end year, neither first reports. entire pandemic, likely last two five years, depending whether vaccines currently works prove effective. religious-right get gods' plague.    Pandemic? mine. noticed another user commented, lol. Ya, stupid Fl started listening federal government stopped expanding testing :/ feeling cheated win man. can't anything nice here...that Florida men run wild future people design computers print 3d bioprinters. that’s shit really begins. Natural evolution lame comparison.

Design print So, uh.... then?  lies biased sources helpful.

Enough shit. Good point. appeal masses best way get south par mask usage. Go Vols! able mine get results 8 10 hours can’t remember. 

However..... I’m healthcare worker testing site run another healthcare worker able make sure mine first one day could check electronically day long instead next day 2 call per testing facility. sort controversial even see someone bring up. thinking reach USA, England, Germany rich countries comes here. seems impossible mass produce entire world quickly. think also spike tests completed last two days. absolute number concerning still. might soon adding Arizona

The reason appears like AZ's case count dropping drastically reducing number tests administered every week. Louisiana higher test count AZ moment. Florida too.

Okay, got trolling, right LOL yet drove comment! proven *any* amount using mask better nothing. Bringing fauci back bring benefits, political leadership acting obstacle way let work should. 
The policies election oriented instead pandemic suppression target 🤷‍♂️ 18 year old respect does.

Says lot raised exposed virus much earlier Texas.

It doesnt seem like it. Look look really different scale graphs different. Obviously Texas way cases now, look back beginning, showing 1000 cases day early April. different. Oh I’m sorry you’re going this. Damn contact tracer jobs county? live westchester applied contact tracer job hired almost immediately. Pay isn’t bad either job entails. I’ve recommending friends lost jobs. hope get back feet soon!! Americans 100 years ago better moderation

Yes, get exercise walking car. Let's face - fat obese people exercise all. hard truth necessary truth. good reading comprehension you?? theoretically talking situation 10,000 cases illustrating exponential growth. never claimed we'd go 4 million 8 million cases fixed amount time.... 


But certainly wrong deaths ""continuing drop"", long go back trying normalize mass death instead admitting virus problem thought? exactly I've friends tell I'm paranoid takes 30 seconds really see big deal haha. Alot us wear masks here.. dont. since March.. I'm also florida corrupt sure, electoral college voted Trump states Hillary popular vote, pretty surprised electoral college decided president actual voters, someone get dirt college voter get tides turn favour Lol. Correct. wonder many like 16 death toll half

We achieve better treatment, though.

The IFR younger cohorts way, way half older cohorts.

If we're testing milder cases, identifying younger, healthier people infection, could see rates much higher that. 50% reduction fatalities age viral load would truly tremendous, milder younger cases alone could responsible much that. missed many infections March April. wouldn’t surprised peak infections back well 100,000 day.

It’s hard analyze cases deaths early pandemic due abysmal testing infrastructure start outbreak. !remindme Yeah, bad statistics. Dr. Fauci need shut 

He helped criminal (Ghislaine Maxwell) stay hidden grandfather’s estate Viewed statistically, child hospitalization mortality rate still incredibly small. 

 Without doubt children less likely get sick. level risk willing accept? generation children get left behind scholastically, impact overall mortality? I'm saying necessarily go school, lets realistic risk knee jerk react anecdotal information. thought talking counting total number, divided number. Silly me. ^ post immediately corrects presented information fit worldview, becomes upvoted thread, irony dies choking spit* Won’t happen.

The study included 3,764 fitness club members, ages 18-64, known risk factors severe COVID-19. Participants randomized access one five reopened fitness centers Oslo, Norway, access fitness center (control group). Participants submitted COVID-19 test two weeks.

Throughout study, 81.8% people used gym least once, 38.5% least six times. end, researchers found cases COVID-19 related fitness center. one case training group, it’s believed exposure likely work, cases trial related case.  answer obvious no. No, complicated. closed.  Yes, constitutional power arrest citizens threatening federal property. problem it, take congress supreme court. right peaceably assemble, turns rioting police step in.

Which it? want executive branch powerful state rights stronger? justification feds using arrest rioters justification used send federal law enforcement protect black lives enforce desegregation. executive branch right enforce law. like law? Get congress change it. legislate. this, amend constitution. Remember big party Ozarks? Yeahhhh, flippant attitude brought us Mind you, massive spike ""flu deaths"", ""heart attacks"", deaths due ""natural causes"", absolutely believe reported COVID-19 deaths indeed plummet. Go even automated guess guess still adult living parent's house projecting. house, rules; legal option gtfo like it. Lol Good thing we're great job preventing spread! hospitalizations ED visits decline hot spots. Since first week July.

Well, decidedly uninformed. currently highest level hospitalizations. one day highest level hospitalizations. even though seen decrease hospitalizations, still higher first week July. they're gonna give everyone except European countries. course they'll get it. Wtf even question? weren’t told March would go away hotter weather arrived? saying opposite? DiRacist fortunate can’t recall Governor Florida highly recommend face shields attached glasses. Another educator recommended got Amazon. comfortable lightweight. I'm planning wear face shield masks. bought goggles, kept bumping mask can't wear together. Safety glasses also option, felt like face shields provide protection safety glasses.

I'm also planning limit water intake minimize using restroom eat lunch outside hope make first weeks cases spread like wildfire decide close school. no! lying! bc well i'm i.d.i.o.t understand difference lying wrong /s Caravans, fishing, biking, et cetera. kind things one would one take vacation one's country, things one would one took vacation another country. Turns generates lot revenue Sweden. pretty big problem though car requirement functional member society. America country world issue. Sorry man. I’m going need little redditor promising mom told hospitals get paid Covid deaths. deaths all. Honestly. think second. Getting paid dead body?
 
But hey. Here’s good news!
 
What you’re describing Medicare fraud. report it, private whistleblower entitled cash reward could amount millions. Scott Hoying Pentatonix put lil rap Fauci included gem line:

""Every disaster movie starts scientist one listens to.""

We're fucked, y'all.

(Edit: thank award kind stranger ❤️) Yup yup yup. also employ 840,000 workers. mention companies live volume. Dont hate amazon. Hate elected officials set rules. Go vote. Governor DeSantis belongs reeducation camp. :( Maybe acknowledge Taiwan's existence then. would prove he's China's boot. True, households multi-generational poor access healthcare? happens households kids bring home virus? lot people dead lot people lost livelihoods around world people going stir crazy quarantine. China going deal people upset one obvious targets upset at. Apocalyptic? Really? think element Yes, gone see grandparents 2 weeks. That's ""immediately afterwards"" means. going see grandparents 2 weeks party dystopian apocalypse desperately trying paint as, alternative could’ve stayed home…

No, alternative going party. That's ""staying home."" Again, black-and-white thinking.

Anyway, fact think 2 weeks long time wait indicates probably teenager, fact said ""LOL!!!"" unironically, I'm fine bowing one point. need grow little bit.

There's honestly need even respond this. read comments read mine. textbook projection. Thank you. units self contained jet pack furnace/AC, turns smart. severe allergies one criteria housing! I'm youngest one feel protective rest them. winning good thing bad thing here? Instructions unclear. You’re spreading misinformation pandemic. literal definition toxic.
 
Hospitals reimbursed treatment Covid patients. **do not** get money Covid patient dies. 
 
Knock off. That’s loser talk #1...MERICAAA Smart generally logical.

I didnt see one fact looks like bunch opinions dipshit. dollar every time said ""keep hands yourself"" I'd millionaire

Good luck chasing money. parents sent camp Global pandemic. negligent. silly thing say.

Everyone lived pre-Emancipation U.S. participated reaped benefits slavery (except, obviously, slaves). Even slaves refused buy cotton lived society whose economy bolstered slavery generally, benefits redounding remove. Abolitionists incensed many reasons, one recognized morally complicit slavery; saw themselves, citizens slave-holding nation, part problem agents change.

Likewise, one cannot escape rippling effects cheap labor foreign markets today. Well hotspots show deal them. Trump Strategy. Proud patriots cannot follow successful countries done, apparently. like Trump plan. blows mind I'm sorry sane residents country. really unbelievable. wack seeing tons countries hitting certain number pretty much every day months. There's way Russia example hit 6k every day abouts 3 months, they've clearly hit testing maximum. Guess many local journalists want call covid victim fat fuck extreme hypothetical, lately Ive wondering legality shooting someone wearing mask/asshole purposely coughs claiming feared life. 

Not recommending happen there’d violence top this, ya gotta wonder. Washington state got result back 48 hours  So, guess we're doomed? 

Thank goodness. pressure off. fact downvoted bizzare. got one weirdest subreddits website. Also Angel staffing could check forgot guys Education people. Get one. put perspective
That's equivalent 4 city high schools case fatality rate US dipping since mid May, probably due new treatments testing (the people test cases detect case fatality rate decreases) case fatality rate higher March/April.

~1 - 1.5% March/April currently 3.5-4%. peak 6% May 16

See [our world  LMFAO FANTA MENACE🤣🤣 Unfortunately, loves cater base, hate science hate government telling do. siren call batshit conspiracy theories great him. slinging shit, pretending better rest us. Med vac fro front lawn white house I’m that. Logic. Look charts Gov. Tony Evers legally can't due deranged state supreme court ruling tying hands pandemic

I think least tv pushing masks. court decision going like worse time goes maybe people stop voting idiots pack courts idiots. That's triage protocol works doctor operating facility incoming fatalities possibly serve. didn’t instyle photo shoot pandemic? comes home find locks replaced respectfully disagree would argue you’re unreasonable one.

I’m denying problem exists country don’t think it’s reasonable take hold entire population equally responsible.

I part. part. expect one individual bear weight narrow-minded, ignorant people isn’t realistic.

I fully acknowledged problem exists.

But you’re opinion exact opposite “Love leave it” - yet equally unreasonable. Also, considering children can't really isolate parents 2 weeks infected, infection rate parents huge point probably children kill one parents children die.  So, dead children, physically scarred life children mentally scarred life children.  Go team Red! Thanks update. Customers covid spreading via surface transmission lack ppe etc employees predict colleges mass breakouts early shut Jesus H. Christ... tell truth simply divorced reality believes that? don’t think propaganda works human brain? Yeah Texas reported 200 yesterday. highest number I've seen while. No, they’re not. Also great Ohio joke, I’m distraught think people Ohio dumb. Joke’s you, I’m also scientist like, fuck off. like another video specifically toilet paper   I'm responding already derailed thread stupid comments like one originally responded are. get ""gotcha"" moment like think lol. should, offer free counties could stopped didn't? New highly-rated poll came afternoon shows thirteen points behind FL. know end soon cut linkage throttle open full careen toward cliff Thelma Louise style.

No seriously, we're dealing groupthink personality disorder like psychopathology. like mental dysfunction difficult impossible understand motives minds afflicted us normal functioning brains. 

I'm glad can't life know means I'm crazy like I'm sure could possibly basing on. Government incompetence season Florida. assholes Florida stay fuck away. need good ol' southern stupidity Northeast. People give shit that's enjoy ""freedums"" safely unlike people parts country. Get educated! Btw secret service arresting people since forever wearing suits tshirts blue Jean's driving unmarked vehicles. never problem police agencies arrest people street clothes. South Korea never banned travel China. 1000+ imported cases have, 19 China, 500 US.

 **Why US still letting citizens travel anywhere world hae 4 million + infected?** Thanks covid discovered one child asthma likely childhood one 'may' grow. He's going dealing life. worry frequently things thing us. Yup. Stay home, throw lamb's blood doorstep, lock door, *don't go outside.*

Also, Psalm 91:10 ""No evil befall you, plague come upon home.""

So.... leave home get evil'd plagued. Got it! Thanks clarifying. remember dumb average person is, realize 50% humans dumber that. sure got from. increasing tests. Yes going much better *now*
Better countries like USA Wtf - course fence sitters. Literally millions people think - meh climate change might bad. Maybe scientists exaggerating. Maybe it’s real can’t stop it. 

If want proof look lack action: *broadly gestures everything* treating demonstrate either essential work otherwise taken precautions getting it... survival potential. That’s like saying addicted heroin choice. People literally check treatment center try escape get heroin. Yeah totally choice. leaded gasoline never caused violence.... Honestly, people Italy either think US absurd taking precautions did, simply don’t care what’s going US they’re focused what’s happening here. Pretty much everyone I’ve talked knows what’s US happy EU blocked US travelers. 

Interestingly, small short-lived anti-mask campaign Italy bit. doubt sparked anti-mask nonsense US, since lots US stuff catches here. think us saw bad really get, haven’t seen heard anyone *actually* agreeing revolting masks. Even lot pro-Salvini (Trump-style, right-wing politician here) people masks aren’t whining it. We’re still much wearing them. guess anti-mask thing successful US whatever reason.

That’s probably right, assuming get enough people get vaccinated. problem is, can’t count people wear masks (which relatively cheap, easy, painless provides efficacy protection common vaccines), count get voluntarily vaccinated?

Schools epicenter community spread illness.

Man, gonna keep running circles? Study Primates Finds Acquired Immunity Prevents COVID-19 Reinfections

A recent study rhesus macaques, among close primate relatives, offers relevant insights first question. paper published journal Science, researchers found macaques recover mild SARS-CoV-2 infection, protected reinfection—at least while.

In work conducted lab Chuan Qin, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing, China, six macaques exposed SARS-CoV-2. Following infection, animals developed mild-to-moderate illness, including pneumonia evidence active infection respiratory gastrointestinal tracts. Twenty-eight days later, macaques cleared infection started recovering, four animals re-exposed strain SARS-CoV-2. two served controls, researchers monitoring continued recovery.

Qin’s team noted second SARS-CoV-2 exposure, four macaques developed transient fever seen first infection. signs reinfection observed detected chest X-rays, animals tested negative active virus two-week period.

While study needed understand details immune responses, researchers detect reassuring appearance antibodies specific SARS-CoV-2 spike protein macaques course first infection. spike protein virus uses attach macaque human cells infecting them.

Of interest, levels neutralizing antibodies even higher two weeks second viral challenge two weeks initial exposure. However, researchers note remains unclear factors specifically responsible observed protection reinfection, apparently first exposure stand chance feds refused lead Nowhere state Sweden *will* reach herd immunity, rather speculating kind immunity *might* (*might* keyword here) show time. obviously [according wouldnt say case numbers leveling off, rather testing can't keep Ok buddy. Jesus. idea jobs work apparently, science works, probably world works general. would hesitant get vaccine. anti vax, immunizations got flu shot year.

Ironic. policy incomplete wrong, subject legal review. Lawsuits form protection citizens. Sweden also hard time reacting. Seeing they've continuously gone done since peak, good job things considered, measure.

Right, person interstate get interstate get gas state mask mandate, person would required wear mask gas station. looks like lag time deaths rising cases/hospitalizations caught SC: per Worldometers data, 7-day rolling average S.C. deaths 41 (this yesterday - slightly higher todays data)

For context, 7-day rolling average stayed 10 entire pandemic beginning month. 

* 1 week ago, 24
* 2 weeks ago, 17
* 3 weeks ago, 13  Yep, officials Sweden claiming success stated goal keeping infection low enough hospitals overwhelmed.

But overwhelmed hospital report absolutely beds available. divert patients, discharge admit critically ill, admit deemed likely die even treatment suspend non-emergency treatment leading massive backlog (ours impossible catch without healthcare reform massive hiring nurses &amp; doctors). 

Swedish officials adamant anything wrong went adopted strategy one else did, based neither science history. claim everyone else ""went mad"".

At least US patients sent home oxygen medicine. Sweden almost everyone age 70 died given nothing morphine care homes; even get IV-nutrients feed. Why? seem make good points. actually took time form coherent argument rather hurling insults.  wish could take credit saw decided perfect.  Masks already required Ohio's 6 largest cities. statewide mask mandate actually help much. right thing -- lead big improvement key places already dong it. So, things headed mandate, they're likely still headed (a tiny bit slowly) after. more. Covid something we're going live on. going away. Kind like flu worse. Well lot people wearing masks . That’s issue lol Id give time drawing strong conclusions. barely started reopening. NYC went Phase 4 last week, think? gyms movie theaters closed, bars allowed operate restaurants, etc. Population 5 million. 

So like death toll 200 Florida. even things. People stop committing crimes! remember, can't trust *China's* numbers communism something Bet y’all enjoyed 4th July BBQ’s though, didn’t ya? Yes, April 10th 1,152 deaths. 14 days (The estimated lag time), 2,614 new cases, locked down.

Florida starting ride delayed death rollercoaster, even thought installing brakes yet! anyone source latest estimated PPV/NPV/sensitivty/specificity PCR test (nasal swab) US? (specifically northwest, data even available.)

I can't seem find anything recent online. I'm saying are! I'm defending teenagers here. research tells us teenagers - even amazing, non-selfish ones! - bad recognizing reward vs risk. That's fact. part brains still developing! large part teenagers, even really amazing ones, mostly still need parental care help navigate life brains figuring shit out. 

Teenagers adults pimples, even incredibly mature ones. They're still growing, risk vs reward scientifically recognized area growth occurring.

ETA: also worth saying, though assumed would go without saying, teenagers make bad judgement calls. mean cases like this, illogic actions actually makes complete sense knowing brain development adolescent trauma psychology. Ayee ya boi got tested today, find results 5-7 days keep mind deniers getting people sick, too.  still better allocate resources ignored safety precautions expense others.

A nurse infected ward would want put extreme risk someone threw caution wind. already thousands volunteers signed 1 day sooner.

Kansas 36th populous state, FWIW. I've seen footage MTA makes Mad Max looks like Boy Meets World. I'm starting wonder people thing rapture USA going MAGA, China backyard.

How ironic. Also extremely overweight. overweight obvious underlying health condition. Immunity generally lasts 0.002 seconds. fundamental cultural thing. Indoctrination USA's radical individualism cultural norms causing problem. Think open mouth sneezes kids. 6ft ain't gonna far enough.

And kids sneeze *moistly*. Ya that's fine reduce ban stadium seating. think banning teams playing outside low hanging fruit - they're biz like other, except make money.

I promise this, whatever testing protocol is,there loophole loophole exploited every team. There's way starting QBs weeks tested positive.

I think Cuomo gonna want guy stop NFL season. Esp since team power Buffalo. deaths occur single day. days release includes deaths days weeks ago. Romania nothing low... Hitting new high records daily past week. sure wrong.. assume lot antimaskers?.. mandate masks. simply said local governments could mandate them. Then, obvious things getting bad, mayor made mask mandate applied businesses. governor knew bind, said mayor solved riddle bullshit.

Having ""no mask"" mandate one thing would actually worse did. I'm surprised governor like DeSantis ""that woman"" South Dakota try one Abbott dumbass department. true! I’m grateful page. 10-19 kind wide range. I’m curious if, say 10-12 different 13-19? teens 16+ aren’t much different physiologically adults. sounds like grouped kids young adults, 18-19, too. Lots shitty, substandard church camps dump kids at.  boffum wouldn’t go restaurant paid close Pittsburgh sort boondocks. zip code 54 cases new ones recently .. 42 cases nursing home surprisingly 0 people died link including video - [Link] Republicans: ""it's okay everyone! *my* kid!"" Seriously. hope patients stay safe. Chemo sucks enough without also worry nurse going spread something could kill you.

Hell, I'm pretty far treatment STILL worry going medical offices high risk. Yeah certainly would worrying gives shit says Look man. don’t know you’re ESL challenging series comments parse.
 
Hospitals **do not** get money death Covid patient. single penny. argument responded insisted get money death Covid patients.
 
Hospitals **do** get money treatment Covid patients. controversy, that’s we’re discussing.
 
But here’s thing man. Let’s say telling truth - doctor bud working place falsifying data receive additional funding. Medicare fraud, private whistleblower reporting fraud stand gain cash reward. think morally questionable approve slavery, people personal opinions happen charge company.

But hey, OK evil, keep reaping benefits slavery defending it. obviously going make difference talking people morals. is. cant spin way.  masks compared bandanas, thin neck gaitors, old shirts, nearly every mask law allows knowledge. Especially n95 variants, idea people would recommend using masks MASKS PROVEN PROTECT VUNERABLE, without hard science downright dangerous. 

Please say, non valved n95s. available go health care workers. 

P.S. people wearing surgical masks, recommendation CDC well. recommendation everyone wears cloth mask offers nearly protection wearer. Make sure calibrated right talking o2 meters, saw comment hopped also got one Walgreens 5 o2s reading 98 actually 93.

Got admitted hospital compared store bought medical grade o2 sensors. happens flu season arrives?  missing two points:

1. get herd immunity, disease suppressed, stays suppressed. applies whether people population immune still carriers. worst, could increase population required reach herd immunity.
2. Someone could infectious, carrier, etc., still much lower viral load risk essentially theoretical point.  Okay, need make real thing. real trophy, awards show, everything. apologize unconscious goat?

(To far? Sorry...) Yeah, get pretty solid feeling one might grant wish send magic quest something, I'll put it. Sinovac Sinopharm (actually developing two vaccines collaboration Beijing Wuhan research institutions) inactivated. probably thinking CanSino's vaccine (currently phase 2) talking adenovirus vector. problems, every type issues - say, attenuated vaccines (none clinical trials COVID knowledge) produce strongest immune response manufactoring process can't scaled fast need refrigerated puts requirements storage transportation, RNA (Moderna, Pfizer) used yet, uncharted territory, etc. say ""no silver bullet"".

P.S.

By way, need give vaccine everybody once. Healthcare workers emergency services, naturally, come first, among rest people occupations involve lot interaction (public transportation drivers, waiters, store clerks, teachers etc) prioritized - significantly cut virus' transmission. normal use walking around, mask reduce oxygen levels.

Firstly, doctor saying. doctor saying masks effect all. None. doctor's claim lie? 

We know everyday lives, see people getting winded walking flight stairs, carrying groceries, etc.. people find difficult breath wearing mask? Scantron. let's call hybrid. come in, fill ballot Scantron sheet, feed Scantron reader. way, case close election credible claims regularities, actual ballots form scantrons go back count. doctor responds: “I don’t know, you’re 6th person today I’ve call tell ignore negative test result.”

This part terrifying. know labs going quickly screwing things worse, means hundreds thousands people running around saying ""just got cleared, let's share ice cream."" agree you. pulled kids full homeschool. need hours day compared public waste time. watched horrible kindergartener he's going learn read well, going computer screen. Breaks heart nots. That's insane happening US. site, read medical reports listed articles here. What? skim scientific reports? Separate shipping handling? That's called Corona.

It's connected sun. Much sun, much Corona, Winter, turns around. talking life death here, intestinal distress. going keep downplaying results this, conversation pointless quickly.

I'm downplaying anything. I'm saying people gleefully working sick. They're miserable want there. They're working sickness given another option.

And politicians giving people option.

You're asking people care you, absolute ass, children, actually like.

I'm saying like understand way also demand policy changes.

It's clear care least demand policy changes yourself.

I'm otherwise done conversation. unreasonable irrational. Yeah? TL;DR - ounce prevention worth pound cure. used kinds special service going they’re crammed inside tiny window... one use think serious exposure lapse protocol. idea measure times daily wait 14 days. way developing problem catch late. fear Asians ancestors always amused me. seems like lot social control exerted Christianity Islam west done instead ancestor worship throughout much Asia. know ordered case needed, cant find anything says used? GovermentS? countries fine, even developing ones pandemic cold flu cases don’t plummet, I’ll shocked. I’m already planning making masks important part cold/flu season wardrobe.  Loeffler - January 24-31 dumped $355,000
         February 5-14 dumped $890,000

Inhofe- January 27 dumped $180,000

          February 18 dumped $1m 

All claim filed asset forms part regulatory scheduled trades. believe coming pandemic didn’t influence decisions nice bridge Brooklyn sell cheap price. require masks get plane allow everyone plane take x amount time. youre person doesnt think covid hoax probably wouldnt want sitting plane full people masks off, right?  Yeah, fools partying hanging friends. dare they, fools! like warning, Italy, Spain, New York City..

I guess American exceptionalism super cool movies, gets patriotic blood pumping, double-edged sword. makes idiots believe they're superior, thus invincible. took german high school! sign up?


Also couch come toilet fridge privileges? least able enforce distancing rules, unlike non-military colleges. people obviously tired winning. people future. least they're eating Tide Pods. America fucking chill whatsoever lot arrogance people think they’re experts everything think superior ideology. Lack empathy swinging directions comes handling Covid-19 Watch article hear reasoning. Otherwise, opinions something taken in. explanation useful talk total number deaths talking total number deaths.  ""this week 15 cases, two weeks time we'll 0 everybody saying well America handled situation"" - Trump. extensive testing, contact tracing, direct care, along long lockdown period.  predators also hunt us. Yeah. It’s barely difference like said Florida open whole time California one first implement mask mandates lockdown hard yet experiencing around amount deaths state open 6 months longer. Quit making excuses California like rest Sub. sorry thing can't cut funding them. Texas Education Agency said schools forced person least 8 weeks semester. I'm sure figure virtual rest year. force kids schools, outbreak overwhelm hospitals. sending kid public school. Possibly ever now. We're expecting tropical storm around central coast. Maybe blow away. 350,002, Drew. said please show IFR 0.1% CDC best estimate 0.65% source says Swine Flu claim 0.02%. idea big difference 0.65% 0.02%?????????? would waste 45 minutes time lies?   understand, hasn’t lot follow positive cases doctors hospitals close cases. 

If could get sort system place handle that, get better idea current conditions there. LOL, people mocking weeks ago said needed lock vaccine. laughing now? Daily Mail link broken. *Duck season....* Dude proved wrong me. moron. Well, shit. mean, well known use child labor. actively profess hate children? No. actions say otherwise? 

I agree boycotting chick FIL A. arguments boycotting control of. argument atrocities documented strong. would take advice ten thousand times Trump's! wish would done job properly, would consisted of: let medical people handle one serve support function, working secure funding facilities PPE, contact tracing testing, also send unified message top measures taking. Instead got garbled mixed message declaring whole thing hoax first month so, massive PPE shortages, complete disregard science epidemiology continual displays narcissistic ego. Plus good chunk country believes civil rights violated asked wear mask (although fair hard lay type systemic selfishness Trump's feet--I think mindset long Trump). mods removed it. guess thoughts two highly qualified individuals counts 'low quality' days. lol ok  That’s breaking news People hang together. understanding can't? No, deal issues time. They're working sickness given another option.

So inability take care forced onto unwilling people form deadly disease?

This crazy person politicians giving people option.

Yes should. still give anyone right infect people deadly virus personal asking people care you, absolute ass, children, actually like.

I saying everyone acting reasonable manner. Purposefully infecting people deadly virus saying like understand way also demand policy changes.

I demanding federal intervention since fucking January. act like not. also think people going work sick charged attempted murder people purposely try infect people aids. inexcusable expose people deadly virus, anyone suggesting anyone right infect anyone else deadly virus personal gain either mentally deficient, clear care least demand policy changes yourself.

Stop making shit stop promoting people purposefully exposing others deadly virus. otherwise done conversation. unreasonable irrational.

Not unreasonable irrational suggesting anyone right show work infect people deadly virus personal gain. plenty options. Like using FMLA benefits since incapacitated serious disease. suggesting people infect coworkers using program? Complete evil incompetence tell.  measure: Belgium instance counts possible corona related deaths, country (Netherlands) counted deaths positive tests. much better mortality rate, look total deaths per quarter (all causes) similar spike.

And subject hand: view problem american doesnt matter, end result same. show personal responsability fuckin VOTE Austria also made mandatory tomorrow. 
We 350 active cases end may. stayed 500 end june traveling allowed EU risen 1450 active ones (and surpassed 20k total cases). still relatively low, people stopped careful first wave wasnt bad (15k cases across country, 700 corona related deaths) Thankfully seem avoiding embracing river Egypt.

In words, we're saying thing different angles. saying ""If disease *not* suppressed, it'll continue infect healthy."" I'm saying ""If disease *is* suppressed, expand beyond current prevalence gradually decline.""

If base transmission number (R0) 3, 70% population immune, measures place, case infect 

3-(3 × (1-0.7)) people, i.e., 0.9.

With generation, R(t) drop slightly further.

If 100,000 active cases point, there'll 90,000 cases next generation, on. If, however, 100 cases, there'll 90, etc., people worried exponential growth breathe easier contract tracing, local lockdowns, etc., become viable. Got translation? 

I think giving much away considering we're living pandemic. need let shaking hands go general, I've always hated expected touch stranger's hand could gross sweaty, know washed it, half time dude like go full force crushing handshake. 

Handshakes terrible need let die. imagine chaos Still could happen use Aztec calendar. ok nobody much testing US does!! brother sickly? inside? wear mask? attending wedding hour mask seems risky making run Wal mart Costco  God's Country. Also, worship Death God, expect?  New Jersey? Why, that's state live! Finally reason happy live New Jersey! ;) think may never go away ? anyone explain cause dont get it. 
If working vaccine shouldnt able go back normal ? doesnt make much sense . Texas schools rdy open Aug 13th...

Yes, try get kids school distance wear masks. IMO schools re-opening in-person learning, least elementary level, probably provides benefits risks.

someone literally sat thought, ""Wow! liberal scum finally going see irony pro-choice. stick 'em."" seriously bothers me, like dont even know theyre trolling point, theyve got heads far asses theyre meta meta... damn small counties Texas!

Maybe USA gets killing millions worldwide, including own(fighting wars) shit federal government planned three months ago. Feds states built surge capacity money printer spitting two trillion dollars. Sadly, math holds use rice grains. denying people dying losing houses, jobs, neither friends boomers, ""silent generation"".

Listen yourself, give one damn people old, isolated unable go events always attended, see friends grandchildren. probably outlive virus, will. personally don""t care travel, travel business years. example, know one woman store since March, high blood pressure. husband shopping. 

You around many years yet, think you, friends, people age ones suffering. likely friends believe wearing masks, one going tell do, believe this? group confrontational angry. Well, looks like big box stores going tell you, want employees get Covid asymptomatic carrier wearing mask. discriminatory remarks boomers pathetic, targeting certain groups safe take anger rage. shallow makes sound.

Thanks stopping by\~ It'd nice every university could test students 4 times first 2 weeks class like USAFA planning. know wrong, root die (alone isolated family) many COVID related dead endure. Lol hitchBOT? hitchhiking robot makes across 3 countries, can't make 300 miles America. 

[HitchBot gets beheaded can't anything nice think we're stupid? Meat grow plants. people hate exact people everyone hates too. don’t enjoy company neither anyone else. Bit hyperbole Lol, matter simplification. sources talking about? Nothing like reported here. 

Also, article nothing pandemic. fact medical examiner still determined cause death shows nothing, unless want jump wild conspiracy theories. I'm surprised wait till air Here’s good test Canada vs US doing:

-How many countries Canadian visit vs many yank visit? problem worked Sweden.  Keep mind there's bit cultural norm family people die deaths drug overdoses suicides often share info obituary announcements. Reddit allows children 13 up, use legs. want make fun someone able run. die likely alone* hospital* awful death* scared* confused*

Think next time hear someone say kids risk schools open fully. Oh absolutely correct. people modelled progression epidemic USA made many assumptions based upon happened comparable countries like Europe example, however think would predicted many states would refuse listen public health advice take appropriate measures quash virus. I’m European, government first lock country even though economy already fragile justification gave really it’s worth taking fall come side many lives saved. feel like politicians America forgotten basic principle measure success politician popularity whether society better place result We're track almost another million 7 days acceleration continues. dont think though... believe education effect IQ... particularly developing skills like problem solving. sad state education around world today, dont think IQ would gaussian all. Walmart, Facebook, donut shop, Instagram, mall, repeat even crazier, conservative doomsday redditers we’re picking bug dates, hoarding food, household essentials, shitting China’s response (for right wrong), telling anyone questioned complete pandemic collapse family literally dead, couple months later crying getting haircuts beer economy crashing. really deep Covid Reddit since January wild ride insanity. That’s true
 Honestly. feel struggle write scripts make feel comfortable go home with. Cuz hospitals max capacity SHORT STAFFED. lot people mediocrely sick dying well cuz aren’t checked much actually pretty good plan place:

The Academy said taking steps prioritize safety, including:

* Testing cadets COVID multiple times first two weeks campus days 0, 7, 10 14.
* Providing random cadet testing going forward identify potential asymptomatic cases earliest stages possible.
* Maintaining Quarantine Isolation space cadets positive tests, symptoms close contact positive cases.
* Creating space social distancing planning military training, classes, cadet living arrangements activities.

Remember USAFA 4000 total students. I've taught single classes university 500 kids one class. 50,000 undergrad graduate students. remotely capacity run 200,000+ tests first 2 weeks school. entire state run 50,000 tests day. Let alone ability quarantine anyone tests positive. we're distance learning fall. bill gates antichrist? got it.

It's hard, know know that. So, minority calling shots? they're louder? industry able produce more. government needs use DPA get done. Without that, companies manage production maximize profit. that, DOD maximize production, damn profit. Ruh roh News 

Got hearty chuckle Yeah thats considered self defense make bad them? Idk man im apolitical gun owner thinks everyone wear mask im trying use common sense.

You know, funny guys. actually think revealing anti-american attitudes prove anything else spread virus purpose. that's bill passes passes original form many dead kids would many you? 10? 100? Shocking. get fair amount rain 'dry' season, [there still distinct wet season May October] skipping KG end world kids. find lesson plans teach home. That's probably would shoes.

""good news"" actually thought going that, feel...reassured? bad news actually assert first place. cite source legitimate local news “It important know situation we’re facing county, community hospital overwhelmed right now,” Vera said. “Our backs wall.”

Admittedly wish would posted source instead, didn’t catch first read through. Right a) next worst hit major city world b) accurately reporting suspected likely deaths. Like everywhere else world, could acted quicker realize magnitude problem acted decisively quickly conservatives say fauci lied wrong. claim makes stuff random? Fauci even mentioned. Probably read article posting it.  Well 3/4 PA basically exactly like south so... “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.”

Well, states handling well almost forced shut basically restrict enforce strict travel ban States. Otherwise, giant game ping pong everyone gives stops following form restrictions Also lack basic common sense, ie belief ""all hoax"" ""plandemic"" obviates personal responsibility. dont believe ANYTHING, wont follow rules. Keep updated Simpsons quote: ""I'm white male, age 18-49, everyone listens me, matter dumb suggestions are"" 😉 I've seeing cases people died, obese.

*This default phrase Covid stupidity lately. found saying many times year. response gaslighting and/or stupidity. Well,someone like salty food (eg me,I totally done b4 spicy fries). China lot countries KFC Franchise. Thanks award :-) 4.1 Million today, hell  🎵 Xi hid truth plague kept coming 🎵 still allows eating drinking loophole (just put cup coffee traytable keep mask entire flight). southwest says expect ""brief"" enforcing that?

amazing people selfish even loophole, are...

applaud efforts, need take i'll consider flying Science-driven community, lol. time sub interested actual science think use support hysterical doom-mongering predictions. yes, long immunity last unknown. [For record, stopped supporting organizations last year, part due public pressure. still overpriced AF anything that's regular fried sandwich, yeah. grilled stuff *is* better competition, least am.

Mind you, I'm eating Chic-Fil-A right they're local. One 65year old woman slashed across throat. Several men 70's stabbed. drop like cheap prom dress midnight come me. tired winning yet? uncle got still trouble getting stairs house. back March hospital week. God save like he's saving bible belt. I’m actually going agree it’s bit silly people really problems wheat beer order anyway, also understandable. It’s hard strictly eat diet must eat- especially already love things make ill. know people ration gluten, like diabetic rationing sugar, dieter rationing calories. Thought process seems be, “if eat carefully everywhere else, splurge one bit poison.” 
So, don’t play game- sick ever want go back there, know people feel good enough keep gluten certain threshold diet. faith ignorance - walking hand hand 2K+ years. Yeah America going hurdles antivaxxers. I'm Canada I'm worried well. Lots antivax. People stupid feel like bode well NHL's return nobody answered go ahead give explanation. virus almost certainly always around simply widespread is. likely always occasional outbreaks (similar largely eradicated rare contagious illnesses) simply 1) poor countries cannot vaccine treat everyone 2) always people refuse vaccines 3) always people cannot take vaccines (or vaccines won’t create strong enough response) immune systems damaged. Herd immunity vaccine essential, even herd immunity doesn’t prevent small outbreaks. virus never “go away”.

For average person developed nations, vaccines largely “end pandemic” them. However, illness won’t go away everywhere once. following years, see occasional outbreaks places low vaccination rates among people dwindling immunity. don’t know long immunity lasts, vaccine natural immunity recovery, found empirically people become reinfected time. said, get vaccine approved Stay informed get boosters necessary/suggested. personally get vaccine essentially free live life desired, however, mask mandates local laws general public atmosphere sports, concerts, etc may take little extra time “get back normal”. people vaccinated lingering outbreaks aren’t major risk people cannot receive vaccines, still required, society, remain vigilant. 

People say never return normal alarmists. get decent vaccine (we 3 set potential approval Sept-November) roll large number people, lives will, majority people, return normal albeit emotional mental scars traumatic experiences had. Depending several circumstances regarding vaccine approval production timelines, can’t give informed estimate normal may return. return, even virus never “goes away” risk vast majority people essentially zero, risk refuse receive vaccine unable receive vaccine also low. Even wasn’t vaccinated Measles, wouldn’t exactly walk around worried catching it. Eventually, COVID19 suffer fate never go away.

It always possible mutations play role, close vaccine. HIV one sloppiest dramatically evolving viruses known man (one of) reasons don’t vaccine despite decades research. viruses mutate, way HIV infects cells way coronaviruses different, already doorstep coronavirus vaccine. people claim never coronavirus vaccine, implying it’s immensely difficult virus, don’t know talking about. Money drives vaccine research. SARS vaccines roll virus disappeared, trials stopped. MERS obscure rare it’s nearly impossible run properly controlled trials determine efficacy thousands patients. coronaviruses cause small fraction common cold aren’t even worth (financially). hope, keep wearing mask, stay informed vaccine research. Normal return, though “new normal” hopefully cleaner society awareness public health. needs statue honor. atleast medal headaches endure working administration. ya know government could get shit together fund effort. also initiative put forth years back rename sewer/manhole covers state ""Rapert covers"" Yup, every causative relationship involves correlation. 

I'd bet relationship widespread, especially among younger, tech-knowledgable populations.

Wanna bet nickel it? Hey forgot add TN list. closed schools county single digit cases. open weeks 2k active. We're terrible job preventing spread...of mayonnaise, peanut butter cheese wiz. regrettable lack good tasing, nice story. you’re saying Florida covering numbers now? 

I'm saying health officials made claim, without merit. conspiracy theory thing? That’s scientific you. 

1: addressing numbers, 2: I'm trusting scientists health officials explicitly stating fact. scientific immediately discount word. like said Florida 6 month head start 

California cases early January, florida not. still ended right behind them! 

California cases March 12: 237

Florida cases day: 33

California 7x, 3.5x per capita

California cases June 1: 115,619

Florida day: 44,479

California 1.5x many per capita. 

Currently: florida 50% per capita. 

Who caught who? making excuses!

Sounds like stop making excuses Florida's terrible response. would prefer someone record Garbage source; MW anti-Israel core.   lol. try careful words Cuomo got good head start sent Covid patients nursing homes spread ~~word~~ virus, red ones started playing ""Dumb Dumber"". “It inherently unjust acts easy accomplish” also tropical storms heading way weekend.
Stay safe. What's daily usa rate human death cause #1? Isn’t referring rate, though? Deaths per case. difference would made? idiots refuse wear masks would listened. Seasonal... Bahahaha well we've hot cold discriminate Obviously didn’t read first comment praising guy killed thousands seniors “doing right” shows political nature Fauci. knows praises media darling Cuomo gets airtime. unless absolutely to.
Wear mask. Concentrate: 5200 deaths far. 5200 deaths far. 5200 deaths far. Even Mickey Mouse heroin wouldn’t killed many... Wake heck up. quoting George Carlin, Sigmund Freud So? say whole truth, masks help leave health people? misled people purpose Oh yeah, bit time, free field area drive in, car, driving hard, something would love do, learning myself

~Mr. Tightwater sure. all: *”Being born world like getting ticket circus; you’re born America front row seat.”*  Sad takes people stay home. guess read article, exceptions. sick mask, sick fly. don’t agree. January weighed 290lbs 5’11” 25 year old dude. already trying lose weight wasn’t really paying much attention it. started intermittent fasting, stopped getting iced coffee way work (300+ calories each), that’s pretty much it. lost maybe 10lbs January March. Decent, eh. 

Then March rolls around, pandemic starts getting crazy data starts coming obesity risk factor. I’m like “shit really need NOW”. 

I refined diet even more. fish, veggies, less carbs, water. typical stuff. also started walking 3 miles per day incredible. 

It’s July I’m 240lbs. That’s 40lbs 4 months. BMI 39 33.5. Yes I’m still obese, I’m way better before. that, change diet almost immediate effect body. walking also big impact cardiovascular health especially since I’m brisk walking. average around 16 minutes per mile, includes pretty big hills. 

If someone would told back March late, would still probably 280lbs worse BMI would still way high. 

Any change make better diet/exercise impact lot faster think. feeling unsafe, reddit list helpful numbers websites.  field hospitals? people done math that, unless original estimates 2 million plus deaths correct, net impact social security running money sooner would without pandemic support 800 lb silver back gorilla? Say so. :( think few, yeah even conservative Premier province let health experts call shots things got really bad. ""Looks fine me"" 

- Ray Charles lol everyone’s got price, especially countries ravaged poverty Well Microsoft chip caused people see blue, respond, crash. agree. that's know big initial spread Sweden compared countries. ravaged elderly homes early on, vast, vast majority deaths (90% +) Sweden aged 80+ up.  


It could routines elderly homes, could big initial cluster was, could variable really.  


But we're seeing now, neighboring countries opening up, spread increasing there. despite Sweden enforcing strict lockdowns, face masks school/border shutdowns, serious cases way down.  


So, early say Sweden hit harder neighboring countries. see social distancing face masks seem big factor (at least Sweden) comes limiting spread. ""protested"" Target walked TV? go home. actual number new cases JAMA published study estimating rates 6 24 times higher. according study real number may 420,000 low side 1,700,000 high side.

I'm waiting enlightened you.

As said, we've got decades mask wearing. 

So where's lengthy scientific process years data wearing mask causes people develop issues lack oxygen, breathing particles mask etc?

Enlighten me. Decades PPE wearing, even guess accurately many people many jobs require them...in millions decades. 

And professions, think people who've worn masks things around home. add in, tens millions, hundreds millions people.

Oh wait, countries mask wearing routine. must billion people.

Well...you've got plenty data. 

I'm waiting enlighten me. Show lengthy scientific process years data wearing mask causes people develop issues lack oxygen, breathing particles mask etc? door factory. closed reopened

Much academic literature China-Africa partnership unjustifiably perpetuates Sino-phobic narrative. media also wrongly portrays China predatory actor Africa. instance, widely reported China invests extractive industry sectors, fact extractive industry amounts one-third total Chinese investment Africa barely mentioned. 

The two-thirds China's investment Africa infrastructure, construction, electricity production, manufacturing finance. fact, compared US developed countries, China's share extractive investments Africa, form mining, example, lower. Except right claim true. Apologies sticking topic. Literally scientific expert saying that. None. last thing intend argue today. 18,000 cases, 3,000 currently active Austin. That's pretty good. Houston, 60,000 total cases, 40,000 currently active.

If ratio active total, 9,000 cases currently Austin. Ya'll better. That's saying time scrap masks start hugging strangers. ya'll smarter places, saving lives. proud. Fuck people small part problem.

Its bullshit call certain group people like beliefs thing happening around you.  imagine given responsibility well-being many, realize there's authority attached end. things, there's definitely limit do. I'm sure governors, mayors, etc around genuinely good people. intricate web people, companies, industries really run things deep, powerful keen keeping things hands reality behind veil see.

It reminds time Denton banned fracking town, governor, powerful oil &amp; gas industry, give finger overrule them. I'm sure there's lot situations like today hidden memories. alot states reopened way early muh economy. Even though arguably economy hit even due surge cases. leaders understand getting virus control vital economic recovery Exactly, taking mask drive short way much trouble. like Netherlands. government always honest story. people absolute prime fitness received extensive medical exams military. know, certainty, catch Covid back feet week needs stay home.

COVID limitation spread fine behavior changes alone. 2009 H1N1 way. novel strain minimal immunity, never really went away exploded school college reopened August precautions. Idk rules US, UK government gave list exemption conditions: children age disabilities following health breathing difficulties respiratory conditions affecting dexterity, meaning able put face mental health conditions anxiety panic non-visible disabilities cognitive impairments, including dementia, may understand remember need wear face visual impairments, restricted field vision, particularly residual vision lower edge normal field impairments would make difficult put take face covering safely, accurately, consistently without travelling providing assistance someone relies lip reading list exemptions exhaustive extends anyone justifiable reason wearing one grounds health pretty reasonable. claim medical knowledge, seems everyone wear mask reasonably comfortably so, small percentage can't able go lives (with social distancing, handwashing etc) without posing much risk.

Sorry, forgot /s. forget things taken literally otherwise actual people would want it. lol Yep!

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Biased media frame stuff sure, evidence corona hoax? Ok serious question - quarantine self isolating mitigating exposure going store infrequently - wearing masks out. Basically taking much precaution possible. much hate toward people opposite? sort make sense people would already gotten Covid now? see lot people social media say things like ""Well hope get Covid Die"". true reality people ignoring guidelines likely already got Covid clearly die (and likely asymptomatic it). simply spread Covid friends/family (the others about) people require hospitalization die either, that's getting closer immunity well. 


Wouldn't agree least degree positive thing healthy people build immunity? mean, after-all, entire purpose lockdown make sure hospitals over-run patients? people get exposed require hospitalization, seen positive thing?

Also note - much percentage population actually think agree vaccine comes? whole goal get everyone vaccinated versus exposure, also realize huge portion U.S. simply accept vaccine. misconceptions here. 

In interview said way get rid disease herd immunity vaccination, that's telling reporter live disease long time. letting Covid-19 spread rampantly society would way achieve herd immunity. That's lazy journalism.

In second article linked Tegnell says: ""We believe herd immunity course help us long run, discussing that, like actively trying achieve made (by press scientists). wanted achieve herd immunity would done nothing let coronavirus run rampant society. trying keep transmission rate low can. taken reasonable measures without really hurting health care schools. going sustainable strategy; something keep months. Coronavirus something going go away. country believes keep (by closing borders, shuttering businesses, etc.) likely proven wrong stage. need learn live disease.""

And lastly third link. defeat Covid-19 lockdowns, gonna happen. point every part world open keep production working. People need eat, work, exist beyond limits homes. happens see new cases (as many places even though far, thankfully, rather limited). way get past achieving herd immunity. [But Anders Tegnell achieve without vaccine, we're learn live disease. spawn karen rolled tongue(finger?) better That’s always option. Canadian? I'm also tired knee jerk shitting Texas similar hot spots get free pass 'reasons' . big state. Certainly large metropolitan areas handling poorly Los Angeles despite 'better' politics. haven’t moved single goalpost. national chart supports overall point whole time changed. original hospitalizations ED visits decline hot spots. Since first week July.

I provided links supplement ones provided. Because, I’ve said, information backs point links already provided. 

Every single chart hospitalizations every dashboard I’ve checked far supports idea new hospitalization rate declining. plateau cumulative hospitalizations means decline rate. 

Look Arizona “Hospital COVID-19 Specific Metrics”. It’s clear day.

Florida new hospitalization data hard find decline ED visits reasonably assumed correlate hospitalizations. people get covid develop antibodies even sure antibodies developed help fight covid. There’s multiple cases people antibodies catching again. Herd immunity might even happen virus. don’t know enough yet. friend stupid likely contributed nothing. would agree completely. chance even single halftime Power 5 conference 2020. So, technically, 100% correct. Even rate deaths continues grow 20 day, take nearly 2 months hit 2000 deaths. Exactly it’s small regional hospital. hospitals room state. misinformation lot tracking sites provide testing numbers [John plus specifically put ""New Individuals"" today's report positive 56,231 tests new individuals. 12.31% 93,644 tests according DoH. 11.5% 88,799 tests (excluding duplicates positive test).

Also, put new metric calculates duplicates negative much better state's get testing numbers duplicate negative subtract full positive new positive individuals. 15,094-10,249=4,845 subtract total 93,644-4,845=88,799 divide new cases 10,249/88,799=11.5%. 

And state reports 12.31% strange manner 72,923 county report 78,550 since duplicates counted. reality, 12.31% rate weird since new individual negative 45,982 due subtracting yesterdays today's state report 78,550 total Negatives. Since state counts duplicates positivity rate stayed 78,550 72,923. add 78,550+10,249=88,799 result metric used get 11.5%.  unless history deleted see pattern I'm going shame fuck anyone see indoors without mask. first time today felt good. Perhaps enough people shame enough trips they'll get sick called right thing. minimum wage employees ones tell people wear mask? Phew thats good sleep peaceful tonight knowing despite deaths increasing atleast good old stock market well read foreign countries, fines vary economic status person committing crime order fine necessary impact.  instance, rich person might pay $2,000 speeding, poor person speeding might pay $200. Yeah agree, said long, cordial version said, one patients would also say fuck that, want standard care, 1-2 patients per nurse flu shut country terrified overwhelming medical system. know normal yearly shutdown.. imagine happen two states backlog time, week later hit legitimately It’s denying unhealthy are. can’t make sense fact shit get rocked catch it. It’s way maintain psychological integrity, also idiotic. I'm also seeing drive order takers interacting customers still. Vaccines due start arriving NZ end year take 6 months reach vaccine herd immunity.  Floridaman natural mate Karen? interested see sort chaos happening tomorrow introduce rules. see plenty people barging shops without puts everyone horrible situation get kind scenes we've watching countries social media people flipping out. maybe everyone behave I'm over-analysing it! Lol medical reasons could cause person unable wear mask safely? Well know Glendale's got big balls. love see it. This. cases it’s impossible company make reasonable accommodations, don’t (example: hiking trails public lands aren’t always wheelchair accessible). We’ll probably see court case point. makes feel better already were. judge Trump weirdo supporters. Well. try really hard to. Please take step right door, ma'am... God created cancer COVID-19, must good. accept contacless payments even prior pandemic.....  I""m tired hearing people say "" Im extrovert need social interactions "" bullshit. 

Every time go mingle people theres chance fuckup catch COVID. Israel bad spot right now, Cases surging government basically anything , Hardly restrictions , critical cases also going massively, 2K cases day country less 9m people crazy Everything outdoors, masks, spread bench.

Simple Sweden per capita death toll 5-10 times Scandinavian neighbours. still one worst hit countries world. call success story. everything tell, death rate still probably 95% overweight/obese. 

I've following super closely count one hand number dead thin people I've found.

A study want say Johns Hopkins also came noted risk dying COVID lower thin person cancer, rather overweight person without. That's *nuts.*

COVID-19 obesity mix.

By means thin person still take precautions; stay home, wear masks, eat restaurants, long things, odds dying COVID minute. Literally mum used proud called Karen whole Karen thing ...feel bit bad cus lovely gentle soul Karen like all. UCLA publishing this? go gotten emails anything Well, guess FL hit 400,000 cases bit early Trump bailed. Yeah know today’s numbers aren’t official yet, it’s pretty damn close.

Fucking hilarious. government agency sued lost many times history. couple main grounds suing agency failing preform basic function responsible agency something outside authority. EPA sued many times latter; often times, BS EPA protecting wet land, costs company money. One former employers sued OSHA false inspection reports resulted fines company. turned out, inspector mixed findings two different inspections two different facilities. OSHA drop fine pay company’s legal fees court costs. case, meat plant failed comply General Duty clause OSHA failed act reported them. Especially stay home get experience. Yeah. reversed course late 2019. Oh haha I've heard seriously, found math nerds calculated already Gasp. bank info study citing Oslo, Norway, vastly different population US terms diet, exercise, access quality health care, etc. doubt many experts would suggest apply study gyms US.

Also note *the results identical* groups, attended gyms *those not*. bold claim ""gym users healthier therefore risk"" supported study. aborting elderly stay open. American, airlines let Ted Cruz hook exact thing. Double standards. fine. lets change topic. Sweden's deaths per capita high? coaches, referees, parents, teachers, band directors, grandparents.... anyone think good idea.

I coach... take virus serious, co-workers feel way... even shocked starting season right now.

How hell say it’s safe larger schools, smaller schools fine.  added, “Chips outdated. It’s nanotech days. Haven’t guys played Metal Gear?” we're testing many people, doubts whether enough ""more people"" significant.

There's still significant selection bias -- one getting worse test labs get backed demand volume. people getting tested right people aggressively pursuing testing.

The pre-symptomatic &amp; asymptomatic aggressively seeking testing (in general) likely now. people seeking testing people paranoid may infected. actual spread infection, however, selecting biases mood - taking opportunities arise, start. Lancet study retracted. studies provided not.

You spreading misinformation?

Why? Except it’s not, averaging 20 deaths day. Thats bamatracker. Maybe family makes everything scratch America not. really much calories types foods eat. eat. may look good outside working trust look like shit inside.  Okay kids back Disney World school couple weeks! Unfortunately Sweden's plan, got complete dud scientist. could one time fentanyl real use. outdoors, least going them.. However, lack masks singing loud possible bode well play out. Israel nutshell.

They've apartheid state committing genocide US funding decades now. Sitting Mayo's pulmonary wing surrounded people carrying supplemental oxygen tanks wearing masks, suggests that's probably it."
