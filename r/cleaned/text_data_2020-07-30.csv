Oh Canadian finished one wave. true. teach middle school. Hygiene hardly existent. sense personal space non-existent. average winter, stomach bugs flu mow students staff point aren’t enough subs cover. average school year coming way. interesting see happens death counts get different President handles things better. sick Democrats always fix Republican mistakes. Sigh, really hope gets voted out. doesn't, even fucking pandemic, give hope country. Excelent article! objective go doctor instead test iowa you’ll get results sooner, usually within 24-48 hrs. 

(at least that’s case iowa city area) Like told friend mine teacher week: appreciated valued. let really vocal minority make feel otherwise. safe thank do, virtual there's pandemic, person never one! Much really comes fact book Genesis lays creation mythology includes needlessly specific timeframes details. Science, course, thoroughly refuted many details, makes hardcore Christians reject science, they’re contradicting word God must influenced Satan.

The story COVID U.S. every grotesque existing flaw American culture made us uniquely vulnerable virus. There’s magical religious anti-science thinking, course, there’s also narcissism, need seen receive attention, distrust government authorities associated conspiratorial thinking, devaluing Black brown lives, reflexive sense one’s sacred rights violated asked sacrifice. pathologies metastasized made us weaker we’ve ever time needed purge deal crisis. studies showing people COVID likely develop blood clots. it’s impossible say 100% definitely COVID. going comment keep mature topic, don’t use wall reference.

Yes sadly people die causes death COULD PREVENTED be. That’s seek doctors don’t feel well prevent things. Come on. Says guy couldn’t simply google trials put hold lol 

Look Gilead, make, ex cfo works for, Harvard Professor Mandeep Mehra, per usual see who’s going gain most, also makes question Fauci quick promote Remdesivir. What’s point list  minks. happens, next riots happen rich's homes going pretty either. fuck legal job worth risking life. go. remotely safe. 50% effective means 50% effective placebo. effective placebo, would 0% effective  Hello New Mexico, state competes Mississippi 50th lot things. competent leadership, though, held line despite similarly vulnerable.

We first wave driven absolute catastrophe Navajo Nation. opened dining-in amongst things beginning June, precipitating second wave across state. big difference NM responded relatively quickly close indoor dining remove exercise mask exception. state appears peaked 300 cases/day, less third per capita MS right now. Theoretically, human get multiple vaccinations thing? one multiple times, vaccine better vaccine year? want ""use vaccine"" crap one. bullshit case study future economics history classes. America became third world country. Livelihood means ""way making income"", extra wealth speculative investment stock market.

Most Americans zero negative wealth (assets minus debt). 150k fine, long convince base Democrats dying. true, highschool, everyone class flu one one, whole school American way seems getting peak deaths state, way hard deaths high, since vulnerable wiped out. :( mean, NY NJ better suffered huge cost. said, proper lockdown still many deaths it'll interesting/scary see happens Southern states loose. [WAPo deaths influenza deaths increase dramatically summer months, large uptick seen. States consistent reporting deaths (causes), we'll see many cases covid deaths influenza data. Organ failure rate could also higher, I'm guessing influenza best method track.  Pepperidge Farm remembers. Security guards prohibited using pepper spray, ""police lite"". can't renter protection without also landlord protection. 

I know lot people hate landlords, cold hard truth. Wishing landlord fail keep ass getting evicted. say lie dogs... Yeah sure, possibly people know real situation China find comment little silly. worry, job exist much longer way economy crashing.  okay, UBI save you. I'm assuming talking Coronavirus. apologize wrong assumption cuz I'm sure asking related post. nurse still contact previous Home Care friends personally believe 40 50% people coronavirus symptoms. personally believe affect people comorbidities much quicker people also personally believe take-no-prisoners virus really give crap young healthy person not. deaths home unreported probably 99% related coronavirus though people never tested qualify whatever reason. think death rate Coronavirus, said done, going around 5 8% people contract it. main concern, however, people understand surviving trick. trick they're finding people recovered Coronavirus long-term new-onset medical issue serious going expensive cumbersome thing person well healthcare system. think 10 20% people mild symptoms. think 30% fall sort mild death category. opinion people. downvote opinion. think prequel Netflix movie El Camino. sure even canon, tbh. might fan made. hope pay medical bills. reason covid antibody tests could positive even person never covid-19  Tell em it’ll keep damn liburls fancy book learnen happen January “Could I’m idiot?

No, must bots downvoting me.” Politicians media telling lies large population lacks insight/intelligence promoting stupidity social media negative effect around world. actually serves role model asshole politicians lie countries. also spurns idiocy people countries read garbage COVID hoax etc. Luckily, countries, proportion people supporting anti-mask ideas significantly lower. Look sectors recovering never fallen: Manufacturing, Dentistry, Tech. USA least. US states public health restrictions assembly, virtually every protest would illegal, since usually many participants.  bans already place, one enforced them.

The anti-lockdown protesters created momentum. mistake allowing continue violation law. difficult justify bans views side spectrum one group allowed blatantly get away it.

Contrary freedumb crowd may claim, perfectly constitutional restrict individual behavior sake public health. laws US Supreme Court affirmed them, lacking. US response fine, except fact mayor US' busiest city said everything fine go outside enjoy life. [This dumb move probably seeded corona outbreak  teacher yes, exactly feels. actually really well presented set tests.

He even particulate measurements. Yep đúng òi, nhưng mà trừ cái tựa đề ra thì bài báo này ko có viết gì về *khụ ""tin nội bộ"" của tụi mình cả :))
Mấy bữa nay thấy dương tính mấy chục người nhìn thấy mà ghê, nhưng mà tui cảm thấy trong mấy ngày đầu càng phát hiện người bệnh càng nhanh càng tốt, tỉ lệ truyền nhiễm trong cộng đồng sẽ càng thấp :v fear going see older sibling desperately trying raise younger siblings. groups sibling separated this, maybe foster care. oldest grandchild high risk herself, older relations, including me. would leave young teen oldest. I've worried now. Best comment thread safety shower, never forget safety shower chem lab I'm originally Illinois starting wonder would better there. course really anywhere go without risking giving someone infection. bad enough heart condition can't get family medical issues would complicated infection. I'd less worried live nurse works hospital here.

What wondering state Wisconsin consider reasonable referenced following, clipped state statutes 939.48  Self-defense defense others 

""The actor may intentionally use force intended likely cause death great bodily harm unless actor reasonably believes force necessary prevent imminent death great bodily harm herself.""

If heart condition cardiologist confirmed would seriously complicate infection covid, mean could consider necessary prevent infection would cause imment death great bodily harm. 

Asking friends curious Cause know answer getting worse.

It's getting seen. sad even ""/s"" proper comment. hard believe Republican governors congressfolk came independently stupid, citizen-killing decision.

Its got President Trump nuts following lead. would, data? legitimately curious see evidence manipulators, much. check find Japan manipulated lot, know places context vis vis everyone else, example. Cant meet someones home, meet busy pub hundreds random strangers.

Yeah totally makes sense.... hospital offloading patients nurse sharing photos unsecured empty air tanks? Coronavirus really sociological problem, epidemiological one. Sure, disease, we're talking social engineering scale that's never done before. 

To expect American population accept quick lockdown foolish. way people would supported lockdown let spread months. Medical leaders need take account population's stupidity. going failure health communication probably studied decades.   death cult no, closing testing sites texas last week: florida week: Hurricane?
Hurricanes Democratic propaganda.

The hurricane gone election day.

The hurricane low mortality rate.

You can't prove hurricane real threat, can't physically see it, stop living life. live fear hot wind water.

The government can't tell freedom ignore it.

Chewing Hydroxychloroquine Zinc herbal tea prevents hurricane damage.

It’s rain storm. rains time.

Car accidents kill people hurricanes!

It’s conspiracy milk bread industry.

Bleach... heard bleach works well stop it. pwned much does. don’t ignorant obtuse. involved studies exactly, much money people walk away them? exactly telling us something know, they? new insightful details? Seems like racket me. Selling drugs COVID 19 era hard. love idea plotline Tragically, none above. “With little evidence supporting use hydroxychloroquine, FDA commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, said Thursday it’s patient’s doctor decide.”

At end day, catch virus, I’ll trust whatever doctor prescribes me.

Also it’s kinda disheartening studies drug sort errors, yet people still latch prove points. Yeah actually, Trump ordered fast-track vaccine program way back January. way back January, also expanded travel bans Pelosi still screeching ""racist"".

Then 3 months later, NYC Mayor De Blasio told everyone go outside everything fine. [Which probably infected everyone think requiring masks ""risking personal safety"" look ""Covid-19."" 

It's okay example risk managers' personal safety?  born 1979. given 100% chance dying point following 110 years. get coronavirus die, guess last straw. Penny wise dollar foolish. guess meme wasn’t inappropriate 140k deaths came before, became awkward one died? Call is: extreme Christian Trump death cult trying surreptitiously bring end times. ridiculous notion is, doesn’t seem plausible explanation. It’s Jonestown massive scale. Hopefully surrounded large number friends family... cough. often people conflate security police. security guard, state's law, prohibited apprehending detaining another person; guard's purpose deterent simply around, observe report incidents. action perceived apprehending (such taking chase) detaining get fired causing lawsuit also get guard license revoked. Good riddance, piece shit alt righters. world lost nothing value. ‘I’m owning libz.’ “You depend upon Americans right thing. exhausted every possibility.” - Winston Churchill (apocryphal) Right, let's ruin education entire generation kids putting futures hold 3 years. America: Teachers underappreciated treasure shapes youth today leaders tomorrow caring proper guidance. God bless them.

Also America: Hey useless fuckwads, stop selfish go teach, give shit think unsafe!  Oooooo fudge! Yeah, help we've conflated CFR IFR much. instance, people like use bad flu season's CFR (of around 0.5%) compare COVID IFR antibody study like this. flu's IFR (even bad year) least order magnitude less sub 0.05%. Absolutely ridiculous let without testing. Whenever countries this, think must lot hubris think get away it. countries nearby, seem like handling things well, mean immune...in addition, people traveling pandemic, general, people going careless overall. understand reuniting loved ones time scattered around world traveling leisure time totally selfish. said, Iceland seem safe travel need tourism really let people without testing. going lot closed schools. Yeah, exactly problem, right? cherry picking take literally take figuratively suit needs rather taking hard look ideology.

What kind blind acceptance authority bullshit? Definitely Jesus espoused. China economic powerhouse lacks military considered superpower. aren’t not-bombing people kindness. Chinese military mostly
Defense based. It’s massive, China, unlike US, almost ability project power due small strategic air force lack large scale carrier groups. 

The war Iraq alone would required full effort Chinese military. Afghanistan added would break it. That’s Happens 2? carriers one can’t even run power. lack massive logistics strength US UK have, drastically impedes ability fight beyond boarders.

On hand 1/5 worlds population country don’t really ever need go outside.

Judging ability project force, defensive capabilities... Australia likely much superpower China is. act though substantial medical debt isnt indirect death sentence long functional vaccine, really give damn anti-vaxxers living next decades. Took 11 days test results Los Angeles Why? running risks anyway. Getting placebo risky nothing. obsession get anywhere? mean, profit it? least posting reddit practice English. get? Really comes smoothly everything runs out. hypotheticals. Maybe find treatments bridge gap get vaccinated available everyone

I clarify though pretty small chance everything works perfectly Yes vaccine improvement treatment time we'll able drastically reduce deaths longer much issue. may never able fully eradicate we'll eventually reach point longer much threat end killing like 150k Americans 4 months example. Tbh think would worst outcome. 

i think faster go imagine get game changer something dramatic changes behaviour.

But wait. sometimes right sometimes wrong. thing part.

Sorry bad english.

Stay safe headline feels much alarmist article, quotes experts optimistic outbreak control within several weeks. That’s would expect that’s happened China’s Beijing market outbreak South Korea’s club outbreak Seoul, also startled people, happened countries high compliance masks public health measures like Hong Kong. misleading. sample 100 recovered patients. 

""The study stated cardiac magnetic resonance imaging discovered cardiac involvement almost 78 patients (78%)""

Definitely warrants investigation, even though sample size extremely small. would interesting know long post covid studied. many complications arising Covid-19, related heart issues patients surprising. Maybe take advice you’re concerned wasting time. ever fuck want. you’re getting hurt I’m saying doesn’t mean need something else. mindset decades making large part created serve capitalism guidelines basically say I’ve saying. 1. Go gyms low head count. 2.

US says ""Hold muh beer"" 😑 Newsom douche though. Masker non-masker, agree that. Presymptomatic spread makes moot point. That's unhealthy Yeah.

If vaccinate everyone risk threat COVID goes ridiculous amount

If vaccinate healthcare workers health system operate fullest potential

If vaccinate teachers send kids school lend car free, deduct mileage depreciation well (or you? - since getting paid, really business deal?), good thing car's owner? Like, borrow car 100k miles, deduct 100k miles depreciation, car going 100k miles worn paid nothing. So, borrow car year two?

In Massachusetts, landlord usually covers heat, hot water, water sewage, garbage applicable. Yes REAL problem. need lay bare. serious problem Christian Nazis country.

You’re story got glimpse guy? expected lol know first case July 15th right? would told specific person test virus confirmed cases? Local government lack transparency.

The virus spread weeks, doubt, control, damage control.

You might worry family there. Yes, adults risky transmission too. think essential workers learn something teachers. risk it? Quit. president going follow science half population going go bbq, weddings graduation parties refuse wear masks quit.

Hi, researcher explain remotely impressive hope:
The study really looked dogs picking one COVID sample among set containing one COVID sample (from HOSPITALIZED COVID patient) 6 non-COVID samples.
""The device composed seven scent holes.

After indication hole positive sample, dog automatically rewarded device food ball. indication time changed successful training 1 2 s. reward eaten, device’s software randomly automatically assigned new positions slides following session one hole presenting positive odour sample. dog, handler person observing study blinded double-blinded study. personnel stood behind dog test runs avoid distraction. device recorded automatically number time length nose dip scent holes location positive negative samples. verified manual time-stamped video analysis ""
Later mentioned ""Samples seven infected seven healthy individuals used study. Two positive samples tracheobronchial secretion, samples consisted saliva...  avoid bias concerning hospital specific smells, positive samples obtained two different hospitals include variation covariate factor appears influenced current results.""
In words, MAYBE, present 7 samples, dog pick one smells like COVID. experimental setup, always 1 COVID-positive sample rest negative. diagnostic perspective, that's useful. also disingenuous say correctly classified 7/7 different samples one trial got right, also claiming dog got 5/7 correct picked non-COVID sample choose 5 non-COVID samples.
Finally, 7 PATIENTS CATEGORY. DOGS REMEMBER HUMAN SCENTS. FUCKING DOUBLE BLINDED STUDY GO ""I got treat picked smell before, one.""

Now wanna talk aggressively hitting much younger women bars got kicked Avenue Pub, go it. got wearing mask, mean masks dont work.

Well genius. Since mask even stop getting it, matter would it. Since rule mask designed spread others asymptomatic, logic make sense anyways. doesnt take genius understand probability works.

It take genius figure point fucking mask. Well remember Trump mandated nation's COVID data needed go directly administration instead CDC starting July 15th...which number new cases slowly started declining. saying data manipulated awfully coincidental... Idaho full people either think virus real, ""it's flu,"" ""masks violate first amendment rights!"" fairly small population compared states (1.7 million iirc) we're fairly rural and, part, conservative... whatever Trump says goes. know Trump thinks pandemic.

Half state's cases single large metro area. ICUs full far know. hotspot north Idaho fairly close Spokane, WA. Since Washington mask mandate, people come WA shop Idaho. recently passed mask mandate, hopefully case count go weeks.

My county seems better here. lot idiots think overblown, decent amount people wear masks. Since March, several people volunteered time materials make free masks public many us taken advantage offers. One particular makes around 100 per week.

We averaging 400 500 cases per day. ridiculous. Can't believe almost June Gulfton residents like Guillermina, isn’t sure. Guillermina asked identified first name. husband bread-winner worked janitor hospitals. Like Isomar, Jose Maria, didn’t health insurance.

Thanks sharing OP. serious illness, far appears flu much dangerous children

Influenza pandemics existed 500 years, allowing advancement medicine scientific study better tackle understand ins outs virus.

In flu season 2019 - 2020, reported 185 pediatric deaths result influenza.

COVID-19 pandemics existed ~7 months. time, barely begun scratch surface people react differently, potential vaccine, danger second wave.

Sure, children make ~0.8% coronavirus deaths US, actually evaluate number using US's total mortality (~154,000 deaths) find estimated 1,232 kids died last seven months.

Now I'm mathematics wizard, that's lot dead kids hand something still yet fully understand.

Alright, contest whose situation worse right now. feel terrible anyone middle college, anyone graduated, Kindergarteners, retired people, middle aged working people kids home... list goes  Says rich guy bought hospital. lmao Americans seem go one extreme another issue?

On one had, many Americans refuse behave responsibly avoid larger gatherings, social distancing, wearing masks, etc. hand, many Americans want total lockdown long possible. kind middle ground?

I mean, kind irresponsibility, pandemic never and. another lockdown, guys need establish new bus lines help newly unemployed people go nearest bridges.

Not mention public health experts keep flip-flopping stuff. Going protest bad thing, agreed protest, suddenly became good thing, even necessary, risks all. hypocritical morons endangered people's lives. Coronavirus merely excuse, looking many countries (like Korea, Singapore) elections time.

Actually, Government afraid losing LegCo election despite DQed 12 pro-democratic candidates.

I've researched topic pretty carefully agree, nobody saying loudly (in informed manner). wonder information may overlooked. don’t think it’s correct way look things hand-wave away concerns re-openings reigniting case acceleration. mention Spain “going tourist dollar”. expect global interstate tourism end immediately remain 0 however long deemed “necessary” Comparable “Only good die young”. 

But agree: better :) Maybe “Ugly bowls don’t break” closer? prefer sound “Bad bowls don’t break.” Although meaning’s obscure problem convince either people, party could show real leadership. even stance Brexit coherent plan carry pretty unforgivable considering main issue election, opposing candidate already deal approved party EU. Oh makes lot sense! love cheeky bit nos Danish government seems think ok, seeing would even consider it. One even listen experts get - listening common sense would've enough.

The difference Sweden's Flatten Curve strategy Denmark's Controlled Burn strategy pretty clear:

* Sweden's cases **downward** trend, yet they're **not lifting** restrictions.
* Denmark's cases **upward** trend, yet they're **lifting** restrictions.

This harsh reality. using example, know worker underpaid upgraded system productivity gain would allow pay worker equitable wage?
 
Honestly I'd guess would different ways answering question, regardless think that's argument productivity gains tie wages. argument would say first job never existed. That's answer, different tying jobs inflation. 
 read years ago McDonalds would increase cost one item (Big Mac?) paltry amount ($0.50?) pay workers $15 each
 
Likely true. I'll tell worked corporate retail (different, realize) shoppers *very* price sensitive. I'd happy pay $0.50 Big Mac, like I'm happy tip well restaurants, think lot people aren't. 
 current system untenable. 
 
I agree federal $7.25 minimum wage low. specifically think productivities ties answer. charge I'd set federal around $11-12 let states/cities increase there. I'd tie inflation agreed upon something measured necessities specifically, like housing, food utilities. 
 
But like said - flyover state like mine that's livable wage single person. think feasible fair mandate minimum wage that's probably needed NY, LA, SF, DC, etc town 2,000 western Nebraska. see effects economy. They're feeling rest world feeling too. Medical care regulated utility. solved problem utilities, cross billing, etc. ok mostly racist, poor people hating 65 year olds vote. Moving on... Censored CCP. Got it. Lowes awesome. obvious. It’s like colds still exist. saying exist way today (uncontrolled, without reliable treatment and/or vaccine). That's misconception. france maybe 50% facilities free/public 50% private. private facilities additional insurance (40-100€/month) pays difference cost public hospital cost private hospital.

The basic 50% facilities free, want care private facility, maybe better (not always case), bed comfortable, pay it, cost maybe 1/10-1/100 would us. encouraging making partial virtual even option? Sorry system fucks bad

Lack testing hides infections turn cripples response. think there's difference empathetic understanding ideology.

Some politicians experiences deepen empathy.

The problem try use current ideological framework solve problem uncovered learning experiences.  Civility key. 

Each time FEEL like commenting someone died, imagine funeral giving speech: nothing positive say, assume would opt say nothing instead saying something negative grieving ones, think? majority people trump administration monumentally stupid, that's onky reason able lot.of evil shit they've wanted to.

However, trump far behind polls, he's started change tune bit. 

But say shut I'm talking trump, I'm talking governors. Even shitty ones (like dickhead abbott) starting panic. pushed back re-opening suspect he's waiting federal aid announced issuing order shut down. refuses live reality again, would surprise either. 

The insanity stupidity republican party surprise anymore. cant wait vote. Credit u/emersonthird

#vaccine volunteers needed - sign here:

The NIH/CDC conducting phase 3 vaccine trial Fauci testified need volunteers. Sign here: NIH here: anyone comment potential testing bottlenecks? I’ve seeing comments awhile people waiting 12 days test results places. Eg Florida hanging around 10k cases reported day week now, maybe that’s resources for? Seems strange many struggling states suddenly plateauing time. allow government response happen Climate Change seeing established government handles pandemic, deserve whatever happens.

If US public wake call change November everything that's happened, there's hope us.  Well yeah. afford wanted boost Q2 profits. else going entice investors? /s Sweden's residents believe importance community responses things. ""me-first"" culture US.

A lockdown required Swedes large said ""cool, I'll whatever needed."" Americans say ""no-mask party broooooooo!""

The US shit culture. Sweden not.  Correct, recently quit, shit company shit ceo. small raise month 2 (I remember long), gave us 1 bonus 300. months later decided give another, likely publicity. give 2 shits associates. extreme measures place protect at-risk populations, relatively small % overall population. get vaccine at-risk populations help enormously Would good true. care downvotes, I'm Brazilian know shit response corona Jordan using grandstand. given time going ask questions.  ideology silo'd group government never good job. Low rate bot get used news. people die, point unavoidable.  Yeah good Lowe’s all, people need keep mind many “essential” workers still earning less collecting unemployment benefits. little bonuses temporary raises nice gesture company, it’s enough ask me. Can’t call someone essential pandemic, ask work rest county shelters place, give crumbs reward. 

Our government needs step dish legit hazard pay essential workers. They’ve underpaid decades, it’s least do. Money laundering risks. got paid twice week. Paid weekly Since I’m seasonal associate. One 294$ Tuesday today got 309$ take 500 taxed therefore it’s one numbers Since pandemic started, whenever need anything home shopping Lowe’s. make want shop more. Well shit certain point, take seriously look back voted important them. campaigning medicare all, campaigning fairly stratified society- look mirror realize asked this.  
And I'm sorry description accounts like, 70% Americans. Biden candidate. 
We totally deserve this. biggest irony still USA laughing first work Kroger done shit. I’ve worked Lowe’s summer gotten one time bonus 150 bucks, wtf hazard Pay bullshit. lie Republican way Medicaid also often waiting period, cuz you, cancer waits. Florida Medicaid basically killed Stephen Perry, Thundercats Writer. Well people took renters, cut stole pain meds could afford meds, wait year get medicaid bladder cancer came back.

Cuz cancer waits. asking US failing hard curb spread disease:

Mr. Raskin: Would agree critical difference \[between US countries\] either presence absence social cohesion political leadership actually develop plan, execute it, stick it?

Dr. Fauci: think diversity response country different states, really unified bringing everything down. aware. Immune memory testing takes ton time, simply hasn’t enough time prove this. months nothing terms cell memory development testing. Memory cells certain markers MAY identified cels markers COVID, there’s way knowing that’s long term thing. GOPs plan though. Promote rampant spread, defund dismantle USPS, continue suppress right people vote; attempt either halt election delay it. Fascism upon us. That's we're counting much...I mean, count deceased course going get high number /s Well, seems Spain fucked going tourist dollar, Belgium seeing increasing cases implementing restrictions prevent another uncontrolled outbreak, Duda Polish Trump I'm guessing little concern necessary measures. Either way, much better position U.S. curb current case trajectories. 100% understand this, decide end $2 pay differentiator June 1st announced one time bonus month actually paid out. bonus really covers $2 differentiator mid July 40hr/week. Amazon Whole Foods making bank. That's pretty neat! Unfortunately recorded second death now... also turned AC units save money? honestly think we've real democracy long time. 

You right considering Hillary Clinton actually got couple million votes Dear Leader yet ""won"" election thanks anti democracy electoral college.

[The Electoral College Greatest Threat though? Like New York City LA expensive, teacher makes $60K NYC $60K like, Pickens, Mississippi different life styles lived. think taking US whole flawed right, even accounting comparing countries. party's position follow national desire. enough people demand it, happen.  Ok. seems like one way get estimate total possible fatalities, still disagree worst case scenario. won’t actually know true IFR pandemic able conduct large scale antibody testing. But... said could open safely!! voted kept electing far-right politicians also hiring... 20% terrible, quite nail explanation attempt. testing containing.

If 20% tests positive means every positive tested person get 4 people tested. trying keep virus spreading rampantly people sheltering home that's enough contacts. tested positive today many people contact last 3 days. Probably 4 probably need closer ten 20 5% positive test rate high really want. way everyone tests positive contacts tested contained community spread. community spread lots people die. r/agedlikemilk? looks like longer threat Sweden...Do think coming back? Thank you. 


Your comment made double check saying discover wrong. mandated lockdown. Take look Swedish economic activity huge drop. lot offices education switched remote.  large proportion Swedes behaved similarly people behaved countries either caution civic duty. sense dealt Scandinavian North American companies corporate world would taken seriously well (in terms cautious) “stakeholder” vs “shareholder” view. It’s still July they’re already back school? Wtf understood saying downvote initial comment.

Depends. get starting signs sinus infection, everything air then. person used work Home Depot say Marvin (Lowes CEO) crushing getting screwed Home Depot VP I'm sorry either Sweden cooking books strain less infectious.

Nothing Sweden approach makes sense. 

We seeing massacares Florida, Texas, Brazil, Japan...but Sweden scoffs barely wears masks says coronavirus? flu treat such!

But every country chaos? sweden different? occured Sweden occur else where? Kind crazy Lowe's, public profit company, treats employees better than, private non-profit hospitals. Sister law wife nurses. confirm hospitals care nurses. it'll surpass 500 easily, judging new cases data. Full message probably feeling little tied down, restricting mobility like me, tired this!! Well, want encourage little patience. pretty strict adhering protocols still... contracted virus. Yep. sounds daunting 150,000 Americans dead it. one lucky ones. Mild symptoms. count blessings urge keep wearing damn mask, keep washing hands, stay socially distant. prevail - follow rules together. 

Be well - Stay well. BC That’s interesting question. 

Unfortunately, different outbreaks within isolated living conditions (a South Korean psychiatry ward US women’s prison) 90% people infected. 

If seasonal coronavirus provided cross immunity, wouldn’t seem prevent infection completely otherwise facilities infected. Note: perfectly possible cross immunity prevent serious cases still allow infection picked testing. i'd delivering biohazard helmet way!

Amazing, cite faulty ""mathematical"" video someone begs subscribers earn $200/month, add hyperbole, wallah, 5k upvotes awards. shit like there's divide listening actual scientists. Got free test Bavaria/Germany day, result less 24 hours. would symptoms test would classed ""high priority"" wouldve gotten result within 12 hours What's stupid fuck countries literally writing playbook properly, completely ignored. leaders even need thinking, copy paste countries like South Korea did. definitely work like love many political economic entities think response news open everything herd immunity.

It's like responding blown tyre Nascar race logic driving even faster take risks.

It's insanity. knew US leadership could kooky Jesus christ.. amazing thing trump done world shine world's greatest spotlight many America's glaring broken issues. Based briefings Sweden, expect something similar done too. keep saying ""keep distance better situations can't keep distance.."" Ontario Canada too. call morning get appointment booked afternoon. results come next day. Hell, highway signs encourage get tested feel anyway sick. Got sniffles sore throat? Get tested. testing infrastructure built solid now. overall we've done well smashing curve even need fully use testing infrastructure. even we're still building preparation fall wave.

We've hovering around 0.5% test positive rate (it actually 0.2% today less 100 cases 2 days row) last month so. Dining dying concept? It’s hold definitely dying concept dentist fucking dude. They've done studies randomized, properly executed studies come Jack shit.

Yes, sure feel ""somewhat"" like that. Pretty much every champion every league year going mental asterisk next name. That’s boat we’re in. I’m taking care children home, preparing homeschool, job. one didn’t offer insurance (less 10 employees). husband’s employer doesn’t offer either. 

Before, save portion income medical expenses family relatively healthy, it’s problem.

Then virus came. took us couple minutes figure out, one us catch it, would wipe us completely.

So yeah, staying isolated much possible don’t want spread it, selfish sounds, biggest motivator lack health insurance. mention think magic vaccine coming, whilst simultaneously believing immunity COVID. Prevent spread, better find people could spread around even possibly kill others isolate people find contact tracing. better nothing. attended training session yesterday poll worker primaries Aug 4th. told us we'd get ""$50 bonus hazard pay"" get tested COVID come back negative bring documented proof results. less two business days.

Again, ""Sweden worse there's need worry"" mentality baffles me, especially Danish government caving pressure there. people fine things getting worse long they're still better Sweden? Depends within state well. friend going day 13 results. went Wednesday results morning.

Glad survived. Look, he's saying moon cheese, he's merely *asking questions.* Apartheid. curiosity, many average Americans without covid would show problems went doctor? Honestly, think biggest reason NHL going weather better leagues (and strict rules place) *constant* battles league players' union. think thing comparable NHL labor disputes 2011 NBA lockout, even relatively protracted compared '04/'05 '11/'12; MLB NFL seen players seriously walk table century (NFL ""has"", summer...so think really counts). NBA short period time. NHL lost one half whole seasons.

It's hard tell players stupid opening league know leave ass they've done before. feel awful thoughts, hope NJ sees canaries goes full virtual. option daughter, teachers need options too. April....2025 Yeah, cool, involves lawsuit judgement first, unlikely also take time. dont think understand scale medical debt debtors country. talking thousands patients day every hospital system country. courts literally capacity hear single digit fraction cases even creditors wanted aggressively litigate. 

The system bottlenecked realistic concern. Patients people tested positive virus positive results registered within hospital database selected study. 67% hospitalised, 49% experienced mild moderate symptoms 18% asymptomatic. Nothing pisses medical examiners blame drug use person’s death suffocated police. Dude wasn’t dead walking around high. 
Once person disarmed handcuffed, continuing assault beg air inhumane. 

These police killed man saw value life. don’t know sure, concern Swedish friends always sounded like thinly veiled cover endless Swedish bashing. posts like ""lol, dumb southern states"" shortsighted. Every place going deal multiple rounds this.

Look literally every country Europe. economies better ours. deaths lower ours. infections lower ours. Y’all get hazard pay? 😅 here. I’ve chest pain palpitations since got bad cough March. got frient. someone works Walmart thing I’ve gotten Walmart mask guess could say REALLY value frontline workers Utah history respecting children especially teachers. Educational staff always thought cheap babysitters. compensated enough work expected risk health lives parents cheap child care go back work. nothing well children staff, everything money. Everyone always mentions Contagion talking pandemic movies feel like Outbreak get recommended enough. Government conspiracies, helicopter chase scene, could want? “Shelling out”...everyday it’s propaganda language. Indiana far right state, wonder might effect politics. technically true provision totally sucks. get wrong... *I'm defending GOPs bill*. 

That said, specific wording full spin intentionally misleading take (while remaining technically true). 

Currently, right without bill passed, employers allowed sue employees reasons. *They always been*. because, unless specifically barred law, anybody allowed sue anybody anything.

I sue wearing blue shirt. do, lose, pay court fees, likely sued malicious prosecution. *Anybody sue anybody anything.*

What GOP provision done awful barred employees allowed sue employers due pandemic safety concerns. even *exactly* true still allowed sue certain safety measures taken, specific safety measures outlined bill fucking permissive worthless - state guidelines much stricter. 

The bill mention anything allowing employers sue employees. create extra latitude employers sue employees. absolutely NOTHING make easier permissive employers sue employees. currently allowed without bill. 

The hot take articles, including one LA Times already linked, simply drawing comparison. Employees sue specific reasons, employers still can. wording seems spinny enough suggest purposefully trying create impression bill actively *adding* ability employers sue employees this. simply case. happened June? America just.... give up? exploit countries, like Nepal, sometimes things dangerous trying support families.

I hope, pandemic concludes, commit better world.

But optimistic. 50 million dollars disappears nothing show it.

I’ve banned political fucking joke others saying way worse stuff I've heard students quarantine, continue classes virtually. heard rumour recently, least Indiana, may allow teachers come back early since they're considered essentially employees adhere 14 day rule. announced yet, sounds like terrible idea. 

We know testing results taking potentially weeks people get them, could lead teachers school staff getting exposed come back school shortened quarantine still results yet.  dunno. He’s losing Biden every poll, high 13 points. Throws margin error window. compare Hillary’s polls, winning 1%, margin error. It’s case Biden vs Trump.

US pays much developed nations (adjusted gdp) government healthcare programs. inefficient bolt-ons already absurdly expensive system. 


All expensive portions life healthcare (low income children, permanently disabled, elderly) healthcare covered via child healthcare subsidies, medicare medicaid. 


The major difference patients enter every single one classes worse off, get lower care, leading less effective expensive care - compounds system many rent seekers (insurance, hmos, complicated billing codes, etc).

Ridiculous discussed months wonder theories exposure Common Cold cornavirus offer least protection?

The virus *primarily* spreads showing distinct symptoms. Full disclosure. furloughed employer April laid weeks ago. making $905 week unemployment taxes hundred two made working Las Vegas craps dealer. say admit lack objectivity.

It's I'm making much unemployment. say since $600 week bonus disappeared. problem wages stagnant forty years. Federal minimum wage $18-19 hour zero bullshit loopholes.

Raise minimum wage $19 hour create huge incentive get people reemployed.

And let cut argument right small businesses mostly fictional impact would pre-COVID... business model requires employees work poverty wages, time go under.

And wondering who's blame wages stagnant, 100% Republicans.

Sensing theme? Im general manager fairly large fulfillment warehouse Northern NJ. demand since Covid began surreal, busier ever. essentially busy holiday season last 5 months. hourly associates received 20% hazard pay increase, salaried personnel?

Reported daily cases doesn’t generally come hospitals it? people find COVID-19 get tested clinic, drive-thru, etc.

Interesting end interview doctor mentions knocked back funding trials Australian Government, look countries funding.  another issue letting virus run amuck. Sure (long) time may mutate less deadly, weaker version (the weaker/asymptomatic versions spread easily deadlier ones literally die off), also chance deadly strain longer highly contagious incubation period takes over.

Interesting. feel exactly way. 

Yep, everyone talks economy. Many Sweden said Swedish strat would protect Swedish economy. stopped saying data show hasn't. 

Sure, Denmark supported small businesses better. also supported workers better. Denmark basically handled whole pandemic, including economic aspect better since protect public health protect economy. something known 1918: http://news.mit.edu/2020/pandemic-health-response-economic-recovery-0401 Ah, Canada would like word.

*We're back, blow away virus!* troll. legit, I’m telling stuff don’t want people die. 

Turns folks, we’ve lied viruses past 200 years. hard believe, it’s indoctrinated society, thing is, things outside human body called viruses. bodies make viruses help cleanse toxins systems. essentially soap. 

They brains, nervous system, digestive system, circulatory system etc. living organism. ask yourself, invade body alive? Cause always say invade right? seek cells, attach them, inject rna cells alive? something that’s alive mutate? can’t above. 

Viruses get ejected cells, bacteria bodies becomes toxic. job get rid toxicity. diseases caused virus, caused toxicity, acidic environment. It’s impossible another living creature pass virus another living creature unless injected bloodstream. Period. It’s impossible way.

You'll never get good change partners. standard part Tango Salon classes. 

A couple weeks ago Sunday event pre-registered dance lady would normally dance anyway, wife registered dance husband, would typically often dance together well. got funny looks, within current rules. wife danced pre-registered partner session. 

In Stage Tango choreography. good example. 2010 world champion previous partner, wife done workshops him, wife Joana, also Maestro pair, Carlos Rosa Perez. top levels Tango competition full snottiest people would never like meet, 4 amazingly friendly. 

On curious note, they're also lot smaller look. Joana comes middle chest, I'm pretty standard height North American guy.  really showcased acting chops one movie virus infects ton people. hero need obviously seeing people afford transportation. Connect dots there. see lots manatees stores SUVs represent everyone. understand kids much virus system, say ""does necessarily prove children passing virus others.""

Why would virus suddenly become contagious host child?? Hard say. seems much favor Senate Republicans knows it’ll end up. hope sides able get somewhere agreeable relatively soon, whole bunch people don’t time stall. Forgiveness better idea many though.  may want tell Virginia Medical least 2 studies running right Zinc. (finally fuck's sake) 17 days Kansas City, MO. thought bad. Taking account sentence said, also read as

# think vaccine fuck-long time away

which logical assume aligns Sweden choosing strategy sustainable long term. Unlike, say, Danish strategy recently seen doubling active cases. Well there's enough studies prove community masks reduce transmission. Read those? probably wondering Democrats pulled hoax making feel like breathe. can't wait real leader grounded reality, conspiracy theorist. thats true since 1800s PEI resuming well.

Mind 0 active cases moment... Okay, long puppies left agree masks generally effective extent. think changes working out? evidence that?

Also, CDC recommends wearing mask gym. sure else would constitute evidence. probably can't find study showing face masks still effective walking backwards, take true generally effective, would show ate effective one specific example. here.  Here's what's sad...my grandson 1 next month. He's running super high temp (102+) past 3 days, rash, hurts everywhere more. Regular labwork normal covid test. get results least 2-4 WEEKS. Drs want hospitalize risk exposing he's positive. they're quarantine test comes back. many people sacrifice Volcano god today crops grow big strong? define recent? didnt downvote btw Honestly think practical matter. Lockdowns shaky constitutional ground without directly challenging 1st amendment. ban protests crack hard anybody breaks ban. get besides fired populace join protest protecting American principles important virus risk? actually make good crackdown. sticking people crowded jails, people ever streets, law enforcement protestors giving virus one another. 

I think know quite literally could enforce ban without inflaming situation even worse. 

Besides, get ""so people go bar drink protest human rights?"" That's happens pull shutdown half measures put arbitrary limits acceptable. Upvoting read thread No, best could get everything sold out. 58% think. Close... Actually kind smart move waiting change justices. Though public health standpoint, agree would nice done sooner. Though maybe point would gotten promptly overturned.  **can** good country's tourism industry, **will** instead find new, corona-safe ways Sweden. Holiday homes, caravans, fishing outdoor life examples tourism boom corona times, sales goods linked exploded, **according him.**

So one guy's account sales goods speculation might entail. Hweover, let's take fishing gear: many Swedish people caught sneaking Norway year, could bought fishing gear go stay home. increase goods may real, necessarily indicate predications came true. think protest bad wait till 600 stops coming people go hungry I’m surprised. New Orleans filming March shit hitting fan. Batman needs tell boys chill Theoretically virus should, one gonna stop anyone protesting. believe already know that, however people protest nothing stop them.... right wrong Yeah prolly think everyone far intertwined China's Economy. That's also China quite imperialist. can't afford shocks economy. 


And land mass like invasion reverse time order, hegemonize special zones territories. 

But think China mildly skittish start war bad economy cause unrest Han population. stability obedience Han population living one greatest rises wealth human history. probably owe money car sell for, might able sell ton negative equity built car loan. use tobacco free nicotine snuss pouches. make flavorless. Completely safe it’s unpleasant use them. also said kids go back school read it. still want take vaccine, don't. want seem anti-vax, use many talking points. 

I'm sure get vaccine, makes feel better. vaccine completely mandatory US. always exemptions exceptions. Source please? Duh  No. Wear mask.  Google said recently least summer 2021. 

I don’t see doesn’t translate every tech company least days week WFH option this. smart doctors lab coats earlier week said there's already cure!

^\s BIG. SURPRISE. TRULY SHOCKED. mean, easiest one, group doctors thrown together like week ago political PAC, included her, doctor stopped practicing sell bitcoin, doctors made political tv rounds before.

And gonna shit experts actually reputations line, higher standard that. Anyone little ones already know this. LMAO forgot sharpie 🤣 Possibly. Assuming 117,000 exposed 682 deaths far Riverside County, puts mortality right around 0.5% aligns CDC. restrictions keep infection numbers down. restrictions removed...

Sounds like another cause behind it. Vacation, weather, something perhaps. True, young and/or family, lucrative. silly question ponder it'll never happen. Words wisdom the\_friendly\_dildo.

2020 wild ride. heck happening Florida's infection rate anyway? actually dropping? people wearing masks now? testing plateaus data fuckery? Fucking gross, people things like that? like giving someone piece flesh bone. Equally fucked up. hey tooth ya go! Enjoy! Ewww nah.  ""Let's cover asses still making sweet money football games."" conversations outside, maintain distance, wear mask going inside room. Dine separate rooms possible. simply incubating. got million infected people. Eh, normal time year. year, Florida would laugh off.

How 94 identified? One favorite allegories type thinking:

""A fellow stuck rooftop flood. praying God help.

Soon man rowboat came fellow shouted man roof, ""Jump in, save you.""

The stranded fellow shouted back, ""No, OK, I'm praying God going save me.""

So rowboat went on.

Then motorboat came by. ""The fellow motorboat shouted, ""Jump in, save you.""

To stranded man said, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So motorboat went on.

Then helicopter came pilot shouted down, ""Grab rope lift safety.""

To stranded man replied, ""No thanks, I'm praying God going save me. faith.""

So helicopter reluctantly flew away.

Soon water rose rooftop man drowned. went Heaven. finally got chance discuss whole situation God, point exclaimed, ""I faith save me, let drown. understand why!""

To God replied, ""I sent rowboat motorboat helicopter, expect?"" -  clue Since seem know medical professional, get onto r/medicine debunk everyone's experience drug thus far fight covid. Here's starting place

Lol edited :) I've going single-occupancy public restrooms need :T figure there's risk directly coming contact someone way (although someone sick mask you, worry aerosol risk. Although restroom \~3 minutes, wonder that's long enough pick anything up). Wtf. Need change to:

I’m mobile skipped not... oops! late, we'll never go back March shutdowns unless want dead economic devastation wish could done one take people can't say swapping cans. could also showed residue time. Gotta sharp point idiots. There's enough stumble onto something matter slowly shuffle about. lack humanity. are, collectively bragging shit-talking.

Cases going worldwide, sooner others. Ontario get time, unless manage literally keep everyone locked like livestock year. fucking church scientology worth billion dollars got millions relief money. basically, expect people get sick die Christmas go ahead send kids back school. Obama vs. Alan Keyes. Keyes from out state, eliminate established political base; candidates black, factor out racism; Keyes plainly, obviously, completely crazy. Batshit crazy.

Haha   trying drug that’s saves life’s starts H want people risk personal safety held criminally liable? 

If one wanna wear mask employees need notify manager manager handle situation. suggestion, Start lifting weights see conceal carry. might save life. brothers company updated policy. removed ban prohibiting employees concealing carrying job.

Corporate needs hire staff deal situation. Occupational Safety Health Act 1970, employers responsible providing **safe** healthful workplaces employees. defense hard keep quickly things gotten horrible US. Remember 3 weeks ago daily death toll reached lowest level since March. July 5 7-day moving average 520. doubled since then. unprecedented second spike seen anywhere else world. Wow story painful read. Glad see well help finish college send brother college well. Unfortunately people need work since there’s mortgages whole need food- I’m sure already know though trying ass. 

However, I’d like point I’m promised job graduate husband tests patients less two different times (both rapid longer test) patients even brought OR. Nothing obviously 100% safe particular hospital particular OR- I’m reasonably confident bring COVID family. also guarantee surgeons, RN’s, techs would much safer around masked kids running around possibly unmasked kids. r/NotTheOnion  don’t produce distribute vaccine soon, going big problems. There’s lot hope riding that. think accurate though. saw like 50 new deaths worldometer. Florida leading high 200s dude know worked airline industry installed software planes airline worked for. software basically software shows plane map world. China told airline fly removed Taiwan map.

Herman Cain's twitter account also deleting older tweets mocking Coronavirus masks.

Conservatives bunch cowards, liars snakes. would even compare Sweden tho, way higher mobility. 

I see big number, compared hit countries pass Lockdown. Sweden good case show lockdowns useful country going hard hit like Spain part US are. Country like Germany (they go strict lockdown) Sweden good proof know live virus.

And since suppression vaccine nonsense great everyone. virus deadlier kinda good numbers, especially understood treat patients better limit spread. saw Mardi Gras float town bit keep numbers Please someone help school board governor understand this. Sure, - much, probably. social distancing ultimately choice - Jester (at least there) crowded to. tbh really dont need stay date everything. end day individuals much. youve made mind actions take (aka youre voting for), whats point reading next dumb thing did? mean $1200 enough fucking leechers?!!? else suppose give billions companies FUCKING CHURCHES give people money? /s Giebelstadt? stationed (back day) ended getting staying gstadt bit longer.
If could turn back time. hate country Nothing like hurricane switch virus obsession. So, many words, close schools contact tracing. There’s going lot closed schools. white orange penis think state-run testing location closed today 5pm, don’t know impacted anything yet, positivity rate chilling 18%-19%. We’ll probably see low numbers next week tho, I’m interested see plays out. good schools, need rich extremely lucky attend. American public education system everything heard American teacher friends really, really bad. Poor pay teachers, crowded classrooms, massive funding inequities. ethical intent public health advisor minimize suffering. muddy message (""quash quick, travel restrictions + free testing + contact tracing + (possibly) enforced quarantines + closures non-essential social buildings + 24/7 masking/social distancing PSAs + leaders modelling masking/social distancing; else gets really bad"") muddy ethical clarity.

All epidemiologists public health officials largely accord, here, late January, early March. politicians economists Administration wrap head around prolonged ordeal major pandemic, knew nothing 1918-19, opposition. short sharp shocked lockdown better everyone lingering slow death expect leave house except groceries til 2021. Ohhh well that's better. impressive GOPD = Gaslight, Obstruct, Project, Delete see relevant, yes. That’s problem isn’t education. problem greed. Greedy people care choose facts believe. amount education world fix problem. Morals needed, haven’t existed since 1950s. provide source these? can’t find anywhere.  sell instead PR? ""I sent virus help zero idiots. realize many idiots. done?"" I’m one them. yeah work here

it energizes get point lot factors play. 1/4 teachers considered high risk. operate schools 1/4 staff gone? buildings prepared social distancing sanitation needs? teachers provided proper PPE? hire staff reduce class sizes? get sick sub class? Even 3% rates still lead outbreak aren’t procedures place. meant federal government hasn’t provided schools (even non hot spot areas) funding necessary meet requirements safely open schools. Without strict measures place risk another outbreak unnecessary injury/ death. could’ve prepared summer instead acted everything would disappear. Bolsonaro: ""little flu cannot hurt me."". 

Little flu: ""fuck you.""  provide sources getting info from? Mask mandate back btw makes even less sense think it... he's clearly stupid, least capability intelligent. acting recklessly? cause serious side effects complications including heart complications. *actual* scientific studies showing nothing Covid. feel like there’s lot new bible thumpers Reddit don’t know Up/Down votes supposed work. said pretty darn true.

Most churches seem collect addition 10% tax congregation people already taxed jobs. doesn’t make much sense me, least that’s remembered growing kid forced go church. sure God Jesus started asking less since then.

Organized religion feels like get rich quick type business cult ask me. wouldn’t like work one day week free money people without asking it. send bowl around put can.

They’ve optimized homeless people everyday week don’t even need use cardboard sign stand weather people’s hard earned dollars. Twas Adam good reference. ""The researchers noted gap reported coronavirus deaths excess deaths varied states. example, California reported 4,046 Covid-19 deaths 6,800 excess deaths, leaving 41% excess deaths unattributed Covid-19 said.

Texas Arizona wider gaps, roughly 55% 53%, respectively, excess deaths unattributed Covid-19.""


Jesus fuck What's like China now? obviously insight. keep dumping trillions it, it’s fake Honestly, that's significantly less thought, although recall initial projections -20% USA -40% China something maybe misremembering expectation expected China. Yep, Canada says strict control American travelers due Covid, actually control illegal immigration. know anybody US want move Canada right now? Yup, 100% pro-capitalism pretty liberal social issues already hard fit in, WTF Trump doing? amazed anyone could still supporting him, still strategy combat virus 7 months. deficit almost 1 Trillion JUNE ALONE -32% GDP growth. needs go need new right kind idiocy stand behind lol. beat cancer long time ago looked healthy rally. wore mask took seriously, could years even decade spend family loved ones. Instead engaged risky behavior attended first large public gathering US months, without mask, dead.  Cons hypocrisy limits I've learned 35% people utterly irredeemably stupid, need told every single moment lives survive. Without people's intervention, would dead almost immediately. hope /s define success rate? 6% success rate three false positives three false negatives what? Im actually glad hes dead yet people think Texas might go blue year... Yeah agree, people naturally don’t want proven wrong, matter deep they’ve gone. think it’s big factor current events really, it’s literally like psychological thing, escalation commitment point it’d massive admittance wrong would rather double support bizarre shit even more. think many books references behavioral psychologists regards 2016-2020 American politics. Weird times. braindead... thought died rescuing jessie. covid? /s Sure looks like upvotes rolling in. Yeah kinda, CDC researcher woman took look test monkey chilling decided shoot vaccine go expose someone infected test it. Difference restricting access pretty hardcore freely distributed. also nasal well.!&lt;

This really cool, yet see reported almost nowhere honestly kinda gives credibility somehow. (I’m gonna go sniffing right away myself, mean find intriguing that.)

I saw [on Vice here:

Paywall warning state provided childcare consumer class. Yes. invested chicken coop generator. sad...they Korean-American really doubt would passed away like Korea. lack contact tracing country going kill many people.  Beware carpel tunnel. shit joke. words, recession happen probably already started. 100%. didn’t like kid,
Love That's good. 

I wonder... free red masks said ""Make America Great Again"" success people... remission, increase risk. remission 14 years. Come on, surely better excuse narratives Healthcare workers same. Quit jobs. fault federal government couldn’t implement unified response people refuse wear masks socially distance. risk life, riskier job pay cut, stressing who’s going watch educate children. worth it. Teachers smart. HCW could learn thing two them. fake news surprised all. could tell lot local churches whether went stayed virtual jumped back person right away. got mine less 24hrs Canada week. Public healthcare FTW Toilet Paper USA build clean tent around desk board? quick connect pvc clear curtains? Anything less day third world status point. mean, it’s got Trump first place. 
Extra shout Lifestyles Rich Famous relaunching orange bastard back onto America’s field vision. They'll find way blame progressives, worry. realize still changed point view, right? hid dear leader died stupidity. They're trying gaslight though believe practice stupidity.

PS, can't vindictive simply stating facts. would be? hit someone car. It’s like trying pass counterfeit $20 bill; selling CD’s; selling cigarettes. I'm one...who dads think people missing key factor discussing declining case counts.

They've closed testing stations hurricanes key hot spot areas.

And labs handle tests area backlogs increasing, we're getting less real-time results hardest hit spots.

So 1 million tests week last, areas country equal. less tests Florida, Arizona Texas Northeast, that's true snapshot.

Also, re: timeline, that's also quite accurate. Younger people take longer, older people tend expire less time positive test. younger people make larger bulk infections, now, timeline stretched days. I'm making false equivalencies. PRC far worse US.

Have good one. too. I've two kids house yard since school stopped. girlscouts meetings, fun summer activities, graduation parties, etc. Watching people carry normal blows mind. really think many adults could totally selfish cruel. know what's going anymore I'm understand restart economy people thinking. 

I signed daughter public school classes via Google classroom home. social butterfly loves school much worth risk. wish everyone would home learning like public school offers. Missing another year person learning stink, ideal way opinion absolutely doubt mind necessary. I'd rather daughter miss friends teachers another school year people loves die never see again. fact Trump told schools open classroom teaching demands lose funding totally ridiculous. already cut funding public schools fter putting witch Betsey Devoes charge public education. like blackmailing whole working group suddenly losing jobs livelihoods put lives danger. acceptable believe one stepped stop this. Trump filled cabinet MLM titans, family members, fundamental Christian science denyers. 2020 country backwards long time. no, mean MAGA, mean strip change better people's well safety.. Agreed, thank Bacon! That’s evangelical belief. There’s form fatalism know ministries. closest would Calvinism, even isn’t fatalist perspective. Traveling work.  

Taking five hour train Dalarna vacation twice different going back forth 30 min work every day.

If check workplace stats instead you’ll see longer go work. It’s like guy born third thought hit triple.  Bryan Cranston dies covid kill flawed relationships show, Lois Hal’s marriage wasn’t one them. provided one another, accepted others flaws, understood deep emotional psychological level never let spark passion fade relationship.

The biggest problem relationship seemed inability figure kind birth control. someone mask caught it, mean masks ineffective. Sort like Kobe Bryant died helicopter crash wearing seat belt, mean seat belts ineffective. grave Wear masks. It’s really simple. School starts less couple weeks! August eye July. heard three. People like eating. Law suits? know schools handing waivers Lots things kill people every year. mean they're causing pandemic. Texas. Damn. 100 bucks says used hydroxychloroquine. though shall receive. Hope makes smile.  Society always three meals away collapse. Look data collection study. isn’t valid. Dammit there's universe lost Bryan Cranston completely unacceptable. become racist select judge group. 

Sad, true. 

Hatred choice. Individual freedoms personal right every individual. that’s would call false equivalency. bias incredible. assume positity meaning “the percentage tests done return positive”

If high, indicates number people tested low testing obviously sick people. least Finland get space train wearing mask since almost nobody wears one. hoping skating scene Malcom Middle, disappointed. even reversable point?  Like, Ontario locked down,and slowly opened precautions, still new infections. guys crazy long distance run go fully start over. Bruh also even aware global politics. west problem general. country treats country unfairly. instead hating country act like racist so. Hating people wrong nations. Quite lot. first local case tested five times officially announced it. 21,000 tested Hanoi alone. Vietnam also leads, far, tests per confirmed case. Remember classic line Christianity, infect thy neighbor Hopefully we're heading now. think everyone waiting congress pass something we'll another shutdown.

There's real division. problem people understand community masking about. preventing individuals getting sick. lowering transmission entire population, enough end spread. people still get sick, lower rate, combined protocols like social distancing, testing contract tracing, eventually end spread. “Christian nationalism”? What? reason conversation someone stated America country snowflakes.

And yeah fair share snowflakes. denying that.

But snowflakes pale comparison sheer number glass hearts PRC. production companies pay employees? It’s like it’s loan free money...

If uses according forgiveness terms unfortunately much free first day school? middle summer! And, joking, became target conspiracy theorists claiming (and Oprah) arrested sex slave trafficking using Covid-19 kind cover up. like flu, heart damage occurs 0-10%, things like spanish flu estimated got 48%? 78% covid.

Or getting wrong? Sue liberals infecting lies Texas mandated everyone wear masks public beginning July. definitely happened sooner nothing, probably cases started go down. challenge test. unethical humans demonstrates vaccine works. vaccine start stage 3 testing 30k double blind study. could approved end year. Sheep? believe facts, proven science, actual data?

What want us believe in, then? You? Yeah mean. pandemic situation, way running country probably effective. total complete control people, idiots crying masks dont work. 

Im discarding possibility lying lot Covid cases. people seem think possible managed get spared NK. hard study. find percentage nearly bad. masks mandatory public transport NL? heard Iceland also mandated same, making first Nordic country so. 😂? Seriously 😂? realize China's GDP figures 100% accurate either ? getting ready bat China keep mind suppressing minorities, attacking neighboring countries worst destroying freedom speech.

Right job stealing.... Jews. need get sleep, I'll field one go. Masks prevent individuals getting sick prevent others getting individuals masks. generally lower transmissibility across whole population large enough subset people wear them.

If everyone gets COVID-19 wears mask result, gives to, average, one person, disease slow spread eventually go away. still transmit still get it.

Epidemiology really deal individual cases except terms post-facto follow-up. triple stamp double stamp, triple stamp double stamp! character attack criticize behavior. someone can’t even comprehend accept common understanding medical science that’s big red flag. akin challenging someone’s competence advocating balance humors cure disease. expect people live 3 months without grocery stores?

Why always either or? know one group wrong time. Depends type vaccine. genomic vaccines stimulate cell immunity like seem to, highly effective stopping disease transmission. Antigen vaccines hand much lower efficacy. point get year, isolate assuming positive. stop isolating either get negative results two weeks past without symptoms. doesn’t sound good.

And response was, ""lol no.""

It's extremely anti-science take really care feel it. Florida again.

Cant get enough winning! Yeah, still good enough still one foot anti-masking realm. even seeing that, much better example Sweden still recommend masks public scientific basis weak comes effective oral protection spread infection. Swedish Public Health Agency refrains recommending oral protection hardcore anti-masker sentiment shocking face available evidnece. 

Amusingly, comment removed ""misinformation"" quoting Tegnell anti-masking sentiments without properly saying ""this think, Anders Tegnell thinks"". Swedish authorities deep realm anti-science, anti-mask issue. 

The Danish ones good per se, getting better. Better said ..this entire story click bait ..completely useless ..but scholar reddit users dying confirmation bias..this launching pad points even match get backed what's really article. work Home Depot like exactly described. That's financial trouble lol that's cost saving ever happened “flatten curve” narrative popular back March? utilities. Wear tear unit. may even use time renovate. there's huge advantage vacant property ready show rent someone right away.

Lets also real. federal benefits paying vast majority people money making pandemic. still paying rent, paying quite time. they're locking threads left right well claiming people 'celebrating deaths' deleting tons comments reason. actions politically motivated reason claim remove said comments lmao, subs garbage mostly certainly nullify contract feel way. Donald Trump entered tchat. find current trajectories US specific states?

Is available way? Can't find PS4 controller stores anywhere. buddy plumber he’s nothing bathroom renovations six days week since March. 100% accurate assessment things US. Yesterday, sheriff one Wisconsin county went record say would enforce new mask mandate issued governor Wisconsin. guy could silently decided, ""I'm going arrest anyone silly new mask order"" went day. Nope, go way issue written statement saying going enforce mask mandate county. &lt;big US, definitely things easy way. Everything battle. read local pastor compared mask mandate Holocaust. Yes, asking people make one small temporary change slow spread deadly virus similar tattooing number people's skin loading people train cars executed (in guy's opinion), &lt;shakin  

If anyone US survives pandemic, due great medical technology fierce sense working together save lives. Nope. People US survive stubborn die. Death give trying claim people move next country he'll exhausted listening people US talk rights freedoms. unruly mob 300 million strong always chose things hard way. legitimately don’t think I’ve seen one single place everyone adheres proper way wear masks. Even fast food places least 1 employee mask neck.  

The way America ending pandemic vaccinations. can’t. surrounded people wearing masks, standing close together, talking, hugging, kissing etc area outbreak inherently unsafe don’t understand you’re willfully stupid worth arguing byeee.

Back March, objective locking always flatten curve avoid overwhelming hospitals spread infections time. opinion, fact easily Googled: always main sole objective So...how clear concise concrete goal dissolve ""let's lockdown vaccine distributed\*"" ignoring original goal spread infections time?

Serious question.

I remember party 15 someone absolutely asking questions. imagine conversation LOT. renumerated creating given survey publishing it, salaries course cover many duties. 

So renumerated. fucking idiot. ""best evidence"" completely explained schools closed kids going places like stores bars without parents, though. based cottact tracing brings home family. “I senate!” I've never even Lowe's life. ordered kneeling pad originally going get Home Depot. 

Good business practices = new customer. Basically opposite Wal-Mart. work Lowe's, mask policy everyone store since July 20th. majority customers wear mask I'd say 20% not. signage posted anywhere regarding policy. leave employees enforce policy printed signage back employee right thing.... sheriff county also publicly stated going enforce counties mask policy. feel like there's whole lot people telling life worth much gainful employment find home improvement store. I've never depressed. Brewers Cardinals postpone series Miller Park. FUCK would open amusement parks big events kickin things ass!? europe, summer fall events got cancelled. year breather year. germany cancelled everything. time stop fucking around thinking subsiding numbers start go lockdowns distancing works. understand article correctly, 11% Sweden red countries quarantine anyway though, danger infect others prior confirmation tests. green country tourists ones without need quarantine would pose risk community transmission.

Btw, point currently list risk countries located? Since Sweden's numbers fell last month source bit outdated curious see Sweden still list. Well love people think random person gets say cause death. It’s medical examiner gets this. highly regulated allowed put cause death updated list. corona isn’t list(it wasn’t early on) person test positive won’t it. would risk license ‘make trump look bad’? people going see actually worse. Right aren’t adding unforeseen deaths happened due covid like putting elective surgeries going routine care could found cancer earlier. make difference. less contagious America still going herd immunity strategy I’m rlly lovin ✨ Lowe's far worst company ever worked for. spent two years working Sears. lot respect Britney Spears old people said something absurd? one shocked Yes Trump. Actually work corporate office phone ringer. gave everyone hours. still extremely upset took several states closing shut offices 3 ft people allow work home could done March.

But I'll say, ever since they've done hell lot help financially. successful people mean one effective drugs cause others die. know lot covid using drug causes heart problems treat infection causes heart problems brilliant ethical idea. cannot believer literalist.

Why? said so?

There entire denominations contradict this. Biblical literalism actually pretty recent development Christian history.

Ever hear Christian say people become atheists hate God? That's dumb sound. I'll take there's source prove claim untrue, then. every redneck country expert malaria drugs sudden first world, second world, third world country designation cold war era. first world US allies, second world USSR communist allies third world everyone else. technically, even USA regressed way back bronze age, would still first world country. (...) lied  wife pregnant first. Due November. that’s I’m trying prepare. soon also won’t time home improvements. virus around since early Jul least hundred cases expect. least swift actions government citizen's cooperation, virus source properly isolated soon hope. There’s reason they’ve playing shitty commercials decades. They’re SEARS home supply store. don’t change, eventually they’ll die out. controlled burn strategy Sweden's, comes [direct quote Anders Tegnell talking get herd Johnan Giesecke also [on tape discussing turning dial infection gets Sweden's actions also demonstrate going controlled burn herd immunity implementing light NPIs. 

The Danish authorities never discussed controlled burn herd immunity, previous actions show goal. wrong represent decision irreversibly taken now, since discussed hopefully changed (as recently Iceland). Many, many Danish experts spoken clearly saying bad idea. Danish government proven slavishly listen one incompetant technocrat Swedish government does, considers opinions independent experts well. 


The doubling active cases bad sign, they're still nowhere near burden infection Sweden. Also, new cases Denmark associated one meat packing plant, hopefully bring control soon.

Maybe would wise worry country highest burden infection repeatedly shown care suppress infeciton nordic neighbors. Denmark reported 60ish cases today, Sweden 304. One countries clearly far, far worse long time. LOL apparently say thoughts prayers, considered uncivil.

Which hilarious. lot service members probably wouldnt fight rebellion I've told She’s clear they’re planning following safety guidelines. can’t go large group people aren’t planning social distance still safe. That’s works. gf MST, merchandise service team, Lowe's came say experience exactly described.

Essential bonus one month one 300 bonus. nothing, generous either. terrible. sort leadership position someone could take got allocate funding resources different medical organizations. Maybe could also take time deliver strong messages unity hope Americans engaged scientific community real world data move towards getting back normal. Oh well 🤷🏻‍♂️ “Many companies better Covid”

That’s straight lie. Maybe like 1% business better. parking lot full doesn’t mean well. Come Home Depot!!!
You guys sit back let Lowe’s take first place like that!
Maybe don’t want bad enough🤷🏼‍♀️

If let moment pass, gonna change ad campaign

Sweden mandated lockdown. close schools covid. recommends social distancing schools closed summer. 

There flu season. Viruses tend go away summer people outside. southern u.s. seems outside fairly safe. inside air conditioning public seems big danger.

You note article compares rest Europe, actually compare Scandinavian countries. well Sweden lockdown little mask use. suffer massive deaths Sweden earlier.

So Sweden may seasonally better summer vacation. know sure. I'm Jax. place Ive hardly anyone wearing mask gym. Everywhere else masks time

I keep reading people asking cases stagnant we've done nothing curb spread but...we really havent done nothing. State leadership done nothing sure, local major cities mask policies think finally starting help completely sane response. mean bad sounds , case US I'd rather 1.5m unemployed shit load small business close face civil unrest.

It's really hard see shit we've done mate. Maybe worse russia fucking knows Definitely this! know someone complained constantly cost health care broken leg PT afterwards astronomically high. casually talked Medicare response ""I trust government execute it. give money taxes too???""

It's crazy expensive health care is. probably minority Americans excellent health care coverage ridiculously affordable price (reason cause union in). However, I'm always scared using never confident everything covered. (So far, always covered.) wish could Medicare system US like every developed country.

I'm saying definitely put use right away, risk/reward significant article says, unprecedented rush through. think basically agree. Lol sure, keep kidding that. Reichstag fire that.

Oh see comment user deleted, called Pelosi fascist Fauci celebrity conman. Plus cute monkey! Honestly, 22 people feild time 1/3 get paid collect covid risk factors. literally paid obese. unhealthy normal circumstances managed correctly. must terrifying consider. America become metaphor usually respond illness. Addicted productivity work instead calling sick day putting personal well health first. 

Maybe stay home, rest up, get well go back work, do, it’s actually productive long run, don’t get sick. give name someone said google it? say within last month back March April thought IFR much higher What, Texas ACA portal purchase subsidized insurance? 

Given R-ness, probably doesnt. got mine, got taxed $316 appreciate saying productivity gains maybe given worker example illuminating there. using example, know worker underpaid upgraded system productivity gain would allow pay worker equitable wage? 


I read years ago McDonalds would increase cost one item (Big Mac?) paltry amount ($0.50?) pay workers $15 each. 


Businesses operating tiny margins raise prices. turn wipe small portion gains workers enjoyed newfound wage increase. 


The current system untenable. capitalists better figure something socialists will. Didn’t also instruct employees *not* wear masks? That’s shop Lowe’s Home Depot. worked Lowe’s bit, great. bought house needed little work basically next door Menards.. closest Lowe's half hour away. made trips Lowe's bigger purchases, damnit hard resist going Menards 3 minutes away... feel guilty every single time do. Retail workers enforcers Jennifer, tasked job. fine, summer heat take care it. peak two weeks disappear alternative barely squeaking paltry 350k? Tough choice Yeah sure.  Oh yeah. Delivery services killing off.

If go pick food, many people decide might well eat there. 

If leave house though.... Yep. work less do, influx cash made working led many people starting/finishing projects spending extra disposable income. Opposite side work entire time get anything extra. know I've work entire time, see extra cent, still try educate son working home days to. mother split week could still continue work full-time. mom teacher Oklahoma. liked ask question pay. going get worse huh.. Yeah, that's happening. lot states closed 3-4 months, way I'm again. Funny, don’t remember that. management due **low applicant flow** higher new **employees**

So bizzare, considering current US unemployment rates.

I guess (soon-to-be) homeless people standards ? im literally arguing, using wrong word. USA flourishing financially; prosperous. 

i hate people create SJW definitions words. mind set exactly. *want* people get deserve, acknowledge *do* deserve consequences. saying since lockdown failed actions humans, objective, therefore, changed something quite unachievable infection already out?

Don't get wrong: me, like everyone else world, would vastly prefer every country behaved like NZ start geographical advantages self-sufficient island.

But late game, lockdowns going ineffective quite pointless implement them.

The thing happened Belgium, UK Italy: locked way late Top 5 deaths per million non-lockdown Sweden.

Once infection out, out. hmmm indeed.... guess really expect outbreaks Scania (skåne) fall. 

That cases Scania one ( many) things make sense me... deaths guess understand... heads Stockholm... cases !?! nope can't even come theory... Definitely underrated reply week. Upvote given! sooner better, manage expectations. Oxford-AZ vaccine likely require two shots acquire immunity - time required shots maximum effect unknown. UK’s Health Ministry also significant concerns closely administer vaccine flu shots.

So even it’s available Thanksgiving — requires compressing 2 years testing 90 days —these factors going delay widespread availability vaccine. Well economy going collapse, Americans going accept lower standard living leaders elected, think economy zero-sum game, they're competing China, terms. Also, capitalism works, hate player, hate game. became curious looked population density relation corona deaths. Sorry going bit OT here...

There doesn’t seem exist correlation two national level. See think maybe population proximity, housing standards, household size degree urbanisation bigger effect population density. all, evenly spread country.

Edit: urbanisation Sweden 88% whilst France 80%. giving Sweden headway fight coronavirus.

FTFY ....it’s almost like motivated something truth....  Flu cases plummeting, would think reduced need flu vaccines, difference could made COVID vaccines. Sweden still performed poorly.

But cultural factors play. example - people voluntarily social distanced, wore masks, etc.

Still significant substantial deaths. tiresome.  correct answer sides question is:

**We know yet, can't know yet, stop speculating**   huh... almost like could done along... know cliche AF, I've thinking getting line next tattoo. someone thrown away years anxiety, resonates me.

Also, immune system often needs reminded things already learned, getting fresh vaccination may beneficial time time. know parameters yet. need understand distinguish a) goal/objective, b) strategy c) tactics

It’s everybody’s *objective* reach herd immunity. That’s go back normality people dying corona virus. Herd immunity achieved individual immunity either catching bug vaccinated. 

The Swedish *strategy* flatten curve, minimise spread protect elderly - hard initial lockdown grand reopening long term, sustainable way. One set measures year. two. 


The Swedish *tactics* involved banned gatherings 50 ppl, restrictions restaurants bars, travel restrictions, remote working recommendations, information campaigns, visit ban elderly care homes etc.


We discuss objective, strategy tactics right executed, long people think *strategy* Sweden herd immunity controlled burn without restrictions without respect human life, discussion tends go south quickly since it’s factually wrong. death number likely spike since first infected patient spread virus hospital full patients issues: kidney failure, heart diseases,...
Many also age 70 above.

It like hitting retirement home US. patients critical condition. Doctors top hospitals Vietnam heading Da Nang right now. patient time 70 years old long term heart diseases. Unfortunately enough strength handle virus way British pilot did....

Dude ridiculous two days ago explain someone don’t need 6 coronavirus vaccines lol come man mutations share spike protein think   Comparing 2 places different disease timelines pretty irrelevant.  mean, totally agree Biden win (unless 2020 wants fuck us even more....) i'm sure comment chain hard know someone close medical protections confidentiality... best historical knowledge Jesus white came northern villages time populated crimea area europeans. one pieces research want say ""well duh"". important remember people, including national leaders doubt efficacy social distancing policy even though relates closely previous science transmission occurs.

This evidence needed keep sane people sane convince insane people really listening voices head rather voices real.


What find interesting comment: ""those national policies saw greater decreases countries regional policies""


Particularly country started things much local rather national basis. Aaaaaaaaaand we're off!! Best one kids lock bunker back yard. believe last season. comment electrified senses. still them? 

Mighty brave assume gender... saw article come across wondered losing much snap. would've thought? figures got bronze medal getting arm shot would go around telling people got try it?

if medal sets life results living better would arm shot of. enternity less. Sure fuck would.  call contradictions.

on contrary bible pretty clear every attempt made convert them. fake news, cause throughout whole K-12 career, never life heard kids starting July.

I mean, got like mid June. Gyms obvious superspread places, idea logic behind this, government decision expecting find logic anyway. seen lot suffering time, believed higher power looking us, would pretty pissed off. Wait thats Bob Odenkirk. Thats Kevin Costner thinks this? complete morons? website french think they're trying hide anything push particular narrative. think moderators sub kind denial. want pretend possible discuss pandemic without talking political motivations ramifications behind response. They're looking avoid triumphalism appeared Herman Cain article. problem people angry, want express anger. want criticize shambolic political response many governments, want express Justified anger Auntie maskers.

People going get around automoderator matter do, aggressive settings mean random comments get deleted. going back subreddit dedicated discussing epidemiology pathology virus. Better worse, subreddit changed. moderators recognize change user base. Almost relief, thought mutated moment there. Well much (when break per worker), one, bonus, pay increase I'm glad see right thing. believe god gave us brains also believe god forbad us gaining knowledge exiled us trying obtain eating apple. hates image live Florida work organization responds things. do.

Heres issue, trying give logic people willingly came place devoid logic.  think vaccine happen, happen while, given everybody right away. lose hope, progress made world vaccine research, many trials shown promise. Oh sure end badly, I'm positive!!!

Locking would've waste talent. Dr. Fauci death threats family Trump’s rhetoric. That’s strong man go back try help fix problem. I’d getting cabin middle nowhere, unlisted disappearing world big “fuck you” way people treated bacteria yes, different way contagous form, get lung form it. Weirdly enough though, early stages, develop symptoms, contagous, think, unlike COVID 19. Oh God... can't people. Even refuse sign new contract forced stay board allowed return home. refuse work forget employed ever destroy livelihood.  news, water wet. test took useless. show virus gotten it. show caught havent gotten yet. oh shit, hope croak Lions tigers *get Covid* oh my! 😣 zero active cases county around 110K.

Why schools open?

Having kids home 24/7 since March extremely difficult. Fuck you, dead Americans. lot Dems TX. Right? 100% feel like I'm one cartoons kids left devices CLEARLY crazy shit happening parents oblivious. Even imported cases? elections, sooner later answering constituency. sounds like unlike COVID 19, early on, contagious yet either, think asyptomatic spread plague, least early stages. Nonsense. Next day completely standard. test takes 6 hours minimum. Build wall, Canada (and make us pay it) 😣 remember.... dying covid September? Private contractors bid contract vendor that's tied New York real estate business. Imagine that. Maskholes Malone There's definitely something China's numbers given hard fast locked they're almost certainly better US probably lot countries. GOP shot nose spit face one. husband decided come her, guess worried. Makes sense. It’s like data useful anything... accidental. hell tall theory come anyway? Fire like dogs First all, vaccine cant. going vaccine made less year. Anyone claiming otherwise simply know vaccines made.

Secondly, even ran test sample instantly take minimum 6 hours PCR test done literally cannot happen faster physically. thats assuming backlog limited number PCR machines existence. Meh infuriating. I'm back work we're fortunate offices, one colleagues keeps knocking door every little question like would pandemic. I'm like please call, text, email silly questions! Stay room! Makes think keeping kids home school really prevent getting covid. 

If anything send kids school leave infect adults. 4k months unemployment pretty sweet deal, lol, enough San Francisco, excessive Alabama. Hey, saw fox news day. Oh wait..  Yeah know article fake??? 
/s COVERUP!!!! normal viruses no.
But RNA jump. house sick March? cats too.

They recovered. corgi also mild runny nose sneezing.

I thought losing mind thinking jumped. Took extra precautions anyway.

Then zoo cats domestic overseas came positive COVID19. Issue can't get alchohol wipes anywhere here. Also, school would ass alcohol starts smudging key caps check association low IQ ( would extremely controversial ) , though quite certain low IQ correlates well rest behaviors well .. weird non-reciprocated rivalry - kind like one Chicago New York. 193 days late, cool  Except almost lockdown countries quickly increasing new infections right now. chance make world better place, fascinating would be?

I native English speaker, putting us shame. know one could craft devastating insult. Yes, though infections getting exponentially worse give away lulz UK never bailed countries though. came separate contributions Eurozone members. Surviving also parents survive 6 year old way important. That's exactly nuclear weapons work going ripple inyo private K-12 schools too. Parents going want pay 10,000 year remote schooling cannot take advantage facilities, resources, teachers. kids 2020 started Planet Apes. world look shout ""help us out!"" I'll look capitol building, whisper ""it's hoax."" hardly dismantled though, it. know probably understand defines karen. everywhere. Plenty asian arab Karen's sydney too. like recognising car pay attention. types studies annoying sense give incomplete picture. reminds study China showed similar percentage, 60-70%, asymptomatic Covid patients abnormal imaging CT scans. hear American doctors last month regurgitating studies implying lots young, asymptomatic people could suffering permanent lung damage without even knowing it. simply case. three month follow would likely show 99.5% normal CTs. case, moderate Covid bilateral pneumonia spent night hospital. recently CT done contrast results showed zero sign Covid infection injury.

For heart studies, average age 49, middle aged 1/3 hospitalized. say heart damage, really talking inflammation, scar tissue. prognosis asymptomatic heart tissue inflammation post viral infection? We've seen viral infections symptomatic, outcomes? Much context needed, ""78% show heart damage"" make good headline. Sweden strategy: took 2-3 times longer rest Europe get death rate less social distancing.

Pretty well poster child hard social distancing better light social distancing. Oh no, think infected cordyceps? That's native South America, possible? gives credibility track record. Chinese hackers targeting maybe Moderna actually something worth stealing. United States America, better believe Targeted lockdowns great idea. locking whole greater Manchester targeted lockdown. That's huge area, much smaller London.

The distance one side GM similar distance Liverpool Manchester City centre kind like sometimes people come stronger side nervous breakdown. 28 Days Later. Life imitating art. It’s hard think everything’s fine people don’t know anyone close who’s died yet, forget that’s good thing pandemic management stay pot. Stay home. Wear mask must go out. worries. Honestly, hate admit this, truth. I've never thought flu considered threat life. I've able shake sicknesses fairly well, this, definitely rethink choices. get you’re saying it’s weird feeling don’t forget measures taking areas actually avoid us dying anyone around us. curious , would reason it’s made illness? skeptical children, especially young children, spreaders.   seems go ability spread viruses.

I think people thought looked idea children cough sneeze shallow forgot aspects children well known work children sick first 6 months things catch them.

They forgot although children may cough sneeze shallow thus project virus far also blow nose, let snot sit top lip, wipe hand, wipe hand surfaces, grab hair snotty hand close face problem sneezing directly face.  almost expect act like older adults case young children. ""... Instead, Piercey said data sharing would left individual school districts. ..."" 

I want hope school districts share data. somehow fear wont time resources. desire still valid. wear simple surgical mask I'm place. aerosol transmission prevalent, way would avoided infected now. test test (including antibody test) negative me. Wear mask life good. Yeah vent holes allow moisture skin eyes escape rather accumulate fog up. goes area high concentration lower concentration. unless eyes skin suddenly dry like dessicant gel pack, volume air actually pushing moisture goggles. Nothing vacuuming outside air goggles. read Walter whites voice swear God, take Bryan Cranston us, beat every Corona virus cell hand sanitizer coated hands! yes, come stronger before. quality food also strong. one cannot wait. never surprised SEC stopping nothing make football happen. biggest surprise announcements ACC temporarily adopted Notre Dame give excuse still play.

Basically, surprised, there’s small chance works out. hope though everyone’s sake safety. volunteer go last line. Fortunately work many tasks remotely would prefer everybody else actually contact people go first, risk higher mine get infected.


But already know colleagues (upper management especially) everything get front line. still lots work home too. Social distancing seems go to. brain heard that, don’t wanna go back work though, I’d feel bad fam went back work Yeah get it, like leech people's assets money.

United States best country. Here, state closely align believe in, almost matter believe in. freely move states around like minded people. Yes there's multitude nits picked. simple fact is, everybody wears mask, little need wear shield. 

Are seriously suggesting wear face shields long lasts? sure, sure. Prepare wave 2. (Ok I’ll guy) show drugs something, don’t think it’s well known amazing extra “New?” needed Harvard Research tell us this? Found it: coherent... Netherlands opened schools young kids early June, knowing full well small kids keep safe distances.

It lead rise cases. rise happening people started traveling internationally summer holidays.

For lot illnesses, young kids spread lot, covid yet see epidemiological evidence. makes think vaccine never come market? Unless Texas weird unemployment law, usually apply benefits backdated time work. - social bubble reduced 5 people (same 5 people next 4 weeks, excl.children 12)
- 10 participants weddings personal events
- number participant events reduced 100 inside 200 outside
- Wearing mask compulsory public spaces commercial streets
- Teleworking highly recommended
- Shopping limited 30 minutes

Plus Antwerp curfew take place 11:30 pm 6 Isn’t America circus right now? article posted yesterday, different Happily married. smaller wedding changed venue rooftop NYC lol, wrong motherfuckers? often coughing? literally coughed least couple years. never cough. wrong coughing hacking sneezing people?

This something never done entirety life. never coughed sneezed person public. 40's cough one time life, teenager. never 'cough'..... times year sneeze, something control.

If ever felt sick uncontrollably coughing sneezing would stay home. People cough sneeze people sound like assholes. never done this, 'coughed' except maybe swallowed something wrong, eating walking public.

So honestly idea fuck people talking time talking sneezing coughing disease clouds droplets spit getting everywhere. lol..totally fucking bizarre. guys sound like wild fucking disgusting animals. School starts 31st July America? healthcare workers closest we’ll see real life superheroes, amazing I'm curious see happens Sweden summer vacation season ends. like 1/3 country ""social distancing"" lake house right now? knock R0.

I one data point, remember 2 years ago wife's company trying buy Swedish company M&amp;A team requested documents July 1st CFO replied I'll get back August 8th. anyone else help? Nope we're gone month July. flabbergasted. Supposedly taking month July common. Feel free chime Swedes! would Sqwee knew solid bro would take test like 50 bucks. early April, Trump told 23.3 lies per day 2020, 0.5-lie increase since 2019. What’s more, Trump averaged 23.8 lies per day since first case COVID-19 reported US — another 0.5-lie increase. Even pandemic, public needs trust rely most, deception remains core part president’s playbook.""

...and *gulp gulp* goes average American. thank explaining way redneck like understand Great Link, Thanks. Yep, exactly. way early game say whether Sweden's strategy good one not. Perhaps they'll face winter nightmare, case strategy failed. Perhaps won't, rest Europe catch numbers, case strategy success. Saying succeeded failed right equivalent calling baseball game second inning. Sometimes group people bad taste. Unfortunately double lung transplant, maybe Number 8 deaths per 100,000 globally one article saw earlier today. probably best use Sweden example do. fucking regret moving here. I've receiving end nurses wrath jumped operating table fear iv. body slammed back table able touch floor. Knocked fear iv right me. Unfortunately, someone recovers acute symptoms Covid, doesn’t mean aren’t risk chronic symptoms heart attacks thickened blood. Strokes, brain problems. 

This something don’t think alot people realize covid. lot deaths symptoms upcoming years hit normally healthy people nowhere. ""They different vaccines. actually going fast,"" Slaoui said, noting virus identified six months ago. ""I've 30 years, fastest thing ever remember went discovery to Phase Three trials four years.""  

Test Engineer here. That's scary reality think about... Sounds like sort product would lot ""test escapes field release"" say tech industry. vaccine industry, stakes little higher... :/ thought best role Walter White Breaking Bad... See previous actually understand that, think security guards stores useless care hundreds reddit parrots say. 3 months ago parroting masks work misinterpreted CDC said (they simply said recommend use protect front line med staff hospital overload biggest risk skyrocketing death rates).

I really care 2 dimensional flamebots parrot social media. I'll go directly studies research myself. course not.
Just portray matter many cases have, certain point counter measure same: lockdown got called back work, don’t want get virus. also made mistake applying unemployment didn’t think would qualify... go tomorrow I’m Texas. know survive poverty don’t want take risk covid. Fuck didn’t apply.... Tell people denied pass July. Sweden might done right thing considering fact vaccine never gonna come market haven’t clusters spikes associated BLM protests

LOL missed sooo many cases Feb April no/poor testing. mean, adding new cases report night new cases report morning weird way counting tally per day. 14 cases yesterday total 45 cases morning, that's people Vietnam GMT+7 timezone count cases. Editing contents article, specially stated 45 cases morning 50 cases ""today"", grouping 45 cases morning 5 cases last night using weird timezone half way across globe, clearly editorializing title.

That's WWJD, that's fandom. quickly showed Americans political left likely stress need protect physically vulnerable (elderly immune compromised) populations shutting social business activities, sheltering place, wearing masks (Igielnik 2020). political right, contrast, likely feel mortal threat pandemic exaggerated news media, businesses social activities resume quickly possible, mask‐wearing either voluntary avoided useless even freedom‐encroaching practice (Igielnik 2020; Newport 2020; Pew Research Center 2020).” someone explain HIPAA me?

Why sometimes pictures inside hospital going HIPAA, see pictures like news reports blur faces? No. Herd immunity objective. is. everyone. Hopefully vaccination.

Secondly, simply former tech CEO, saved 100 million lives foundation. thousands scientists medical professionals working him. spent billions dollars funding research help worlds overlooked helpless people. may expert virology, worlds brightest scientific minds working for/with him. Take instance drug Esaxerenone approved Japan hypertension US despite developed US company. It’s Japanese patient population responded substantially favorably drug relative western cohorts. 

This every drug development company usually careful consider diversity trial design controlled Differences people often lead different responses medication.

That’s also way schools bothering with. Source: 30% country. 55% ~~votes~~ mean land 

I really wish country could rally together threat like this. one side politicized issue science. EuropaPark opened May, Germany.... museums, etc opened early May. think anti cancel culture stuff pretty evidently peaking ""they canceled Stella Immanuel giving medical advice deal incubus attacks""  Can't afford bruh, something something wall street. Naw he’s thanks concern seriously doubt vaccine rolled next summer. Counties initiated lockdown strategy buying time, good valuable time. new anti-virals coming market like Avigan potential cut hospitalizations half, mention half dozen vaccines set appear scene end next year. know yet whether Sweden (like NY tri-state area) hit resurgence. Yep, high school, middle school, elementary pre-k Crap. That's 100% increase yesterday. sending kids staff die, let information out. So... people stop coming school, wait 50% kid's class dies taking school? kids bringing home spreading around? make notes died following bodies morgue? What? kind person he? need answer guess know. Many children never know fathers marriages lost it.

My personal fav Dads never miss game complain children play video games. pretty common scenario Doubt would even months TBH. we're already vaccinating people (if anyone front line workers get vacc'd first, fucking travesty) hopefully we've reached level control thing combined w/ logic suggesting viable treatments well, firm grasp thing time second batch roles around. Keep mind potentially 3 vaccines year's end also (potentially) multiple first rounds making ways society. bet months start relax quite bit. Hopefully Thanksgiving people see family might seen many months. sIdEs Twins amazing week, course happen. Suing would appear x great idea massive cash cos hundreds thousands Americans working unsafe conditions seeing parents die, health insurance. wish could hear attempts sue. Yea, rich big corperations..Life would continue ever rest us proper UBI place. difference everyone 18 makes less 150k year would money deposited account every month..For dumb reason people seem false idea UBI benefits poor they're ones going pay it, they're fact also receiving money every month. garbage excuse people working becoming lazy completely false proven false since they've studies since Nixon administration. ask one question. Would satisfied $1,200 month provides? absolute bare necessities? answer obviously ""NO"". People still going want nice bass fishing boat, downtown mansion, new hiking boots, trips rome, countless things. again, anyone thinking people would stop working 100% incorrect. 

A proper UBI would also save us money compared running 83 overlapping low income welfare programs currently waste 1.5 trillion yearly plus paying staff run poverty trap programs. funds shifted proper UBI...UBI would also improve economy additional 15% less decade would otherwise. 

But right now. need keep people alive. need lock everything right time. lot confidence considering phase 3 trials (where see effective vaccine is) starting leaders. Lots people speculate possibility vaccine % effective might best start with.  fauci said goggles good idea means started mandating use 3 months ago agree think nba nhl continue playoffs end. MLB struggle finish season. least baseball it’s lot easier make games. NFL it’s damn near impossible. believe NFL start season, highly doubt able finish it.

COVID driving costs, that’s offset deferred elective services. might service rebound effect next year portion services aren’t outright cancelled, net effect minor. Claiming 4% many engaging safety measure pandemic bizarre. Loooool legit delusional. I’m genuinely curious- they’re willing pay much extra employees, also take real steps protect them, like making masks mandatory enforcing social distancing employees? stopped shopping Lowe’s couple bad experiences manager said couldn’t make employees wear masks correctly (or apparently stand 6 feet away, employee standing right next wearing mask nose uncovered.) much people traveling South vs. lax behavior people general. MD contact tracing found 44% cases family gatherings 25% house parties. case hospitals insurance companies profiting. might even make leery... Utter shitshow embarrassment MLB right now. needed stick landing like NBA. Meanwhile... Home Depot donating trump. think clear I'll buying next bag hammers.... well spread COVID. That's strawman - try again. Infected students mean infected parents grandparents . 


It begins school , ends family. Must hard people differing opinions. Thats said back early april. long hospitals dont get run number curve same. One shorter timeline. Countries longer curve due longer lockdowns worse economies come top death rate vaccine. Yep, fucking ridiculous sham retail investor. Trump half businessman says is, he'd use body wall Mexican border. ""We build wall"" indeed!  see people every time go grocery store. thought people want wear masks, made due store policy. way rebelling. childish, disrespectful, childish others. would keep distance people leave alone. likely type blows questioned. soaking every second baseball far whether it’s team not. Sports long / distraction shit going either personal life otherwise. don’t see finishing sucks don’t know MLB shuts NFL pulls either. sucks much get shut down. 

Also kind pissed players bitched saying MLB wasn’t taking safety seriously seems like players don’t seem be. Marlins situation seems players going club Atlanta heard radio cardinals reportedly players went golfing. recent interview Chris Wallace, lied national TV. interviewer says, US worst mortality statistics COVID. Trump claims fake news assistant come piece paper says US best COVID mortality statistics. guess hiding data making statistics pretty easy say that... **fact** relaxed **after** implemented. Iceland approved NPI relaxations decided implement them. precedent thing happening region. There's nothing remotely consisting personal attack comment. Montreal Expos still around... we'd chance! I'm less unnerved pandemic people's reactions pandemic. Unfortunately mostly judged amount money made, wish could stop this. 32 people late gadolinium enhancement

We're regularly posting regular breaking sales.

And yet company still telling us get raises due COVID. 10 days patients usually recover develop serious covid. That’s lot plasma! Nah. It’s funny it’s true! Oh wait...

It’s depressing it’s true! Trumpists absolutely learn lessons. We've seen outbreaks beach goer's, huge partying gatherings, camps, restaurant/bars on. see ReThugLiKKKans dying C-19, hospitalized telling Cultists horrible disease wear masks. hear sound falling upon deaf ears. 

I posted post got link: *Those people* ^((meant slur)) might well take fully loaded automatic 9MM pistol play Russian Roulette. Ok then, nothing?

Let's hear brilliant plan then. much take mass produce boosters compared dose? Can't believe people still say unironically years ago, identify things level ( least oldest shes 8) countersinking holes, basic plumbing like sprinkler system Vaccine factor.

Hospital treatment way better March/April - ICU deaths probably 75% lower back then, Sweden exposing many people virus anyone knew treat killed lot people unnecessarily. else Jeff make day nation year?!

Los Angeles full shelter place all. people streets, restaurant's(not supposed open). many places still open supposed be. understand go restaurants many still open along small business shops Westwood, L.A. frustrating. Winning party leadership means getting good side couple hundred thousand Labour acitivists.

Very different winning votes 50-odd million people, singularly failed do. Hysterical nonsense Because, again, rules game predicated civil racist murdering psychopaths.

Thanks South screwing up, Northeast get used work hom3 depot something similar except cut peoples hours way back Lowe's worker here, 100-150 employees per store concern single doses we're still unsure long immunity lasts. year? Two years? That's boosters second doses targeted. initial shot booster almost certainly effective single dose, even we're exactly sure much. quite know booster overkill, better safe sorry critical time.

This also phase III trial continue span years, determine long-run whether single shot effective enough. lock everyone globally, else get new flareups moment illegal immigrant evades quarantine (like happened Vietnam) daughter back daycare week. I'm obviously nervous it. restricting parents entering building limiting number kids class (I think kid one 12). bit cold comfort, appreciate interacting hundreds kids like public school.

For every handful people follow guidelines strictly someone fuck carelessness article post comment thread taking place states, **as fact**, Denmark relaxing measures.

Also, would appreciate devolve personal attacks. That's stupid Employer California - reassess January  400,000 people *many people* seems bizarre disagree.

My statement implied Swedes engaged voluntary safety measures. listed examples. NFL season happening say myself, follow guidelines one phase stricter current lockdown phase much possible. I’m gonna risk organs cuz rich/republican asshole wanted make couple extra bucks/get haircut. opening day weekend made guess. watched 'guidelines' half-assed players non-distancing many people wearing masks wearing nose chin... etc. 
I guessed season would cancelled early middle August... saw Marlins stuff happen. I'm guessing they'll cancel end next week bc play possibly 40-50% clubhouses infected?? Mark Cuban President! problem definition ""essential"". know is, however businesses use every loophole find force people work. Tipping know comes directly post-slavery USA, white people figured could skip paying salary newly-freed/employable ex-slaves service industry, force remain subservient order get bigger tips (or tip all). also explains alcohol service minimum wage lower retail min wage many jurisdictions, tips expected make difference. kind monster politicizes centers disease control middle pandemic?

And kind spineless jellyfish gives it? Wtf none taxes income tax go towards things like go banks reimburse worked level regularly met face face agree.

History may eventually consider great man, many failings may end contributing that. definitely good one. House scheduled leave August, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told members recess would start chamber passes coronavirus relief CE certification bullshit, saying it’s perfect cannot bought. It’s even remotely profitable. *never* profitable prior Amazon sale. Amazon doesn’t separate Whole Foods business retail businesses, there’s still little data support argument it’s profitable all, let alone “very”. vaccine, infect kill many people country. countries vaccinate thoroughly.

From US's standpoint, way cheaper add seasonal COVID vaccine annual flu shot go countries forcibly vaccinate everyone get eradicate disease think back April virus almost killing residents New York City rate. mean depends many hours allowed work per week it? Like less 30 considered full time anymore?

I've furloughed 8 hours per week, I've waiting 3 months state process benefits.

I know enough honestly.  backup video anywhere? valid treatment options identified tested. point distant future, combination vaccines treatments allow us get back normal, close it. Testing retarded. related capacity country. USA awesome.

On July 27, Court declined issue injunction mask mandate. Citing Jacobsen v. Massachusetts, Court found that “no constitutional right infringed Mask Ordinance’s mandate … requirement swear covering clear rational basis based protection public health.” point, Court continued, “constitutional rights ideals limited government … allow (citizens) wholly shirk social obligation fellow Americans society whole…. all, constitutional right infect others still refuse enforce mask rule. Yes, student tested earlier parents sent school waiting test results come back. She’s real grinch What’s endgame though. people still going essential jobs virus still there. Unless lock every single person up, 90% 95% EVERY SINGLE PERSON spikes inevitably get lockdown. we’ve wasted month 90% people’s time nothing. echo chamber refusing see fascist Pelosi invited celebrity doctor attack Trump her. ill person history abusing stats.

You engaging relative scaling change that.  Middle road approach. Putting power back local school boards, requiring open person learning either. 

**Molecular test.** Also called PCR test, diagnostic test detects genetic material COVID-19 virus using lab technique called polymerase chain reaction (PCR). health care worker collects fluid nasal throat swab or, less often, saliva. **Results may available minutes analyzed on-site days sent outside lab.** FYI study advanced mathematics. apology (that's candle light vigil for) simply blanket email parents notifying one infected children. email would go say classroom disinfected continue follow CDC guidelines. Yada yada yada ONE CANNOT SAY! test maybe try people. sit butts test oblivion can’t decide works. decide works actually using it!  mean, data speak itself. reported aligning objective reality know infectious disease. Cooking books, saying lightly. accuse someone abusing reaction abuse harder, openly, they're trying save face. u

Herd Immunity needs vaccine. anyone “real” numbers? saying hospitals receive money get COVID patients, even hospitals report bogus data. CDC director without capacity make decisions, wonder virus rampaging America.... sort sick joke. Lol ok that’s great sentiment upvotes historically absurd. reason even exist resources millenniums millenniums tribes people’s nations wars lost. losers don’t even exist anymore many cases. It’s best way future agree it’s way people hundred thousand years fellow hotel worker! 

I’ve spent last week fighting figure requirements employees are. 

I asked GM guest policy told probably 3 times aren’t mask police.

Our company doesn’t require masks employees working laundry housekeeping. keeps employees safe even guests idea. 

Stay safe! options US ensure physical school buildings safe low risk children, no. hope prison, doubt it.  Talk cynical. want number phycologist? Yup. plan along. Yup; couple weeks RI folks reported waiting 2 weeks+ test results. 

Most tests general public go though national private labs; they’re backed due surge south west. 

A lot cases caught/spread Fourth July 😷 Mate even that. crooks shared trench coat pretending democracy. Trickle truthing people vaccine next year deal fighting poverty fighting disease middle-aged couple well $2000 month. 

Most middle-class Americans somewhat oblivious cost medical insurance get work benefit. mean research takes time want Remind Me! 1 month opening schools straw breaks camels back, we’ll yearn days july/august hear out, hospitals paid government deal insurance. 😯 forgot mention big corporate welfare queen come. Cautiously* 10 day still kinda wild though, especially since assume pretty seasonal. That's probably drowning every hour summer. 

It sound like 3,600 number drowning swimming pools though, source claims ~50% natural water makes easier believe. utter nonsense argument based fantasy. argument laughable start ad hominem strawmen. Since can't back anything state cited evidence. Agree. Could dual systems bit. Duh. said overall mortality, brainiac. stopped caring covid surfaces, wash hands touching stuff. 🤷‍♀️ now. asymptomatic? Texas Florida tags place live MA. Florida somewhat normal, almost never see Texas tags, that's alarming. Carolinas pretty decent showing going on, too. Yeah, probably different names different states concept Sounds like time ditch tip system switch delivery fee.

Never understand people like this. can't afford tip, can't afford food. Last name: Simpson Yeah, mentioned response below! small mutations normal fine. Sweden isnt done. Stockholm done. Every city Sweden still get fucked. one indoors, not. HCQ confounded steroid use, one cannot say certainty observed outcome due HCQ. one many issues paper. can’t fucking stand amazon anymore, offense all. Gtfo can’t afford pay guys hazard pay bezos makes like 60 billion dollars last 8 months. US-Mexico border 3100km long.

The average person shorter 2m, purposes estimate, I'll assume they're 2m long.

3100km = 3 100 000m; 3 100 000/2 = 1 550 000.

The USA 10% way towards laying first layer bodies across border. Actually, 1.5 million deaths pretty close reasonable estimate many Americans die factoring attempts lock down, throttle better treatments time, indeed, done! timeline recap another thread, looks like this:

The timeline camp was:

* June 17-20: 138 trainees 120 staff site
* June 21: 363 campers 3 senior staff members join them
* June 23: Teenage staff member got sick went home
* June 24: Teenage staff member receives positive COVID test result
* June 24: Campers start sent home
* June 27: campers gone camp closes

There 597 people affected result this. 344 test results reported, 76% positive. Even 253 people report results negative that'd still 44% positive. nobody wins cases need settle. psychic? GDP results Q2 released August 5. It’s sad I’ve forgotten literally everything working annoying. worked four months, stretched maternity leave 3 months (due csection Christmas-new years) worked month came back. horrible would wake saying call scripts sleep. dreamed place dreaded much. best friend roommate started job time literally threw tantrum like 3 year old one day laying floor screaming crying “I don’t want go!!” 

I forgotten scheduling bs actual work terrible. terrible. I'd favour baning alcohol social ill. prohibition simply work far drugs concerned. Oh ok, talking ass? 

Thanks valuable insight Florida citizens handling pandemic. Yes, lower Belgium, UK, Italy Spain went much harsher lockdown. Yes, deaths higher neighbouring Nordic countries, need jump gun since need least wait end year get much accurate picture deaths. 

Secondly, Sweden failed protecting nursing homes like UK Canada. However, Swedish government better prepared learnt this. 

Thirdly, deaths covid-19 per capita adequate make cross country comparisons. Excess deaths much better measure. 

Fourthly, new paper came Eclinical Medicine, belongs family Lancet journal, found lockdown much impact. Recently, Health Ministers Denmark acknowledged going lockdown fact mistake. 

Lastly, Sweden closely reaching herd immunity, whereas neighbouring Nordic countries still behind this. means Sweden much better chance less exposed coronovirus second wave. Deaths per million population

\- Denmark - 106

\- Finland	 - 60

\- Norway - 47

**- Sweden - 558**

Sweden's fatality rate almost 12 times higher Norway's.

Learn arithmetic.  helps. 5700 LIFES 4% LESS BNP DROP WOOOOO accusation... ignore it. 

Well, Vietnam got zero, today struggling new outbreak. Virus *not* eradicated. Australia pretty close, Victoria real shit show now. Iceland’s numbers small growing virus gone. 

Getting zero great. Keeping zero really tricky thing, don’t think possible. wish though...

Wanting virus eradicated vs. Believing two different things. Sorry, I'm respond personal attacks. businesses code ethics like this. Good guy Lowe's business on. friend root evil modern society .. say that's indicative rising pattern. Active cases still today going slightly. Didn’t Texas reject Medicaid expansion? may explain high uninsured rate. Goodbye Home Depot Tell turism. work Vons stopped 2 dollars real quick, went public Albertsons showing great numbers quarter. government needs step in, companies stayed open seen record profits going pockets corporate people go work, staying safe working home. cut vast majority help hired begining cleaning sanitation, cutting hours praising us essential workers leaving us skeleton crews hazard pay. Yeah got dig garage look fog proof glasses measles chickenpox specifically, US good job vaccinating. fact, good job care countries unvaccinated, herd immunity strong enough we'd protected anyways.

Other countries infrastructure needed vaccinate measles chickenpox scale needed eradicate disease. could try them, would cost continuing vaccinate ourselves, additional benefit ourselves. Plus there's guarantee it'll even work.

If develop effective COVID vaccine, there's reason believe we'd treat differently measles chickenpox Oh, sick. get ur POV now.  stuck perspective im stuck perspective. certainly see contributions differently. im black white all. Sounds like worked you! People still scholarships. took gap year would like $17,000 drain next 2 years college. One could say MLB season a...

Feverish start. Oh ok cool. Someone woke wrong side bed lol rushed vaccine - nothing go wrong never take America. shitstorm muh rights explode even now. disgusted 17 year old Abington, PA, US cancer patient, Juwan Adams, recently fired ""mask violation"" pulling mask breath fresh air dishes. also flexible allowing attend Dr. Appointments. love swabbing public, sorta kink. Yep. Imagine, global coordination, could wipe several diseases matter months. go eliminate bad things new found spirit cooperation solidarity. Maybe go back old fashioned shunning go without masks. ""No, Timmy, want playing dirty Johnson boy. None family wears masks. bring home COVID."" kind spineless jellyfish gives President US? fuck? can’t believe people would actually go? Florida epicentre world moment almost people going bars??? That's reply ""I live fear, can't fear dead."" forget liability protections companies COVID lawsuits. biggest mistake focus preserving insurance company profits complete utter failure control medical costs.

Imagine elected official really causing deaths people. would people do? Would say lets wait next election? Maybe hold couple signs walk around chanting slogans? would remove governor immediately get someone else charge? 

If things really bad, urgency? lack urgency means people still ok local government doing. least bothered enough act. tobacco denial gun violence denial preceded them. source careers cut short due injuries? seems incorrect... Well they’ve open playing games (without fans course). Baseball socially distant default sports one team already (Miami Marlins) huge outbreak cancelled games next week least. There’s currently bubble, theoretically there’s good incentive guys stay home except games game’s don’t get played don’t get paid.

Sorry stupid question seems like know. cells “remember” make antibodies something similar that? Fauci new Simon. help unhealthy residents country. Look obesity rates. Man covid 19 freaking purge. Dr Fauci right, trust peer reviewed articles cites rather word. know mean? trust Fauci right thing pandemic ultimately need go literature supports evidence HCQ isn’t efficacious COVID treatment. yea also hope wakes us makes people realize universal basic income viable path forward Yeah people think change natural law ask hard enough. That's normal thing think 2020. No, I'm not.

You're saying everyone less bad Elon equally bad Elon, skeletons closets. I'm saying either that's special pleading, also extends people worse Elon. Including Hitler.

I'm arguing believe moral relativism sham neither defend obviously wrong special pleading accept argument tarnishes thing intended defend. logical thing would abandon argument, acknowledge count type skeletons ones' closet matters, many people fewer less serious ones Elon does. instead, like engage deflection pretend skeletons topic hand. saw episode (specifically car chase) kid could sworn real life, started watching x-files adult years ago... mind blowing Amazon go history corporation sparked whole new worldwide passage anti-monopoly laws labor regulations. least April* remember seeing article March, saw multiple articles April. March/April sure lot earlier coming saying now, US doing. much freedom units? Either complete treatment herd immunity pays off.  choose enforce private company mandates.

they enforce anti saggy pants rules restaurants guy Metallicas Wonder I’ll back staying home 60% pay soon... 

Genuinely curious know nothing Japanese response pandemic. government order business shut pay employees reduced salary? voluntary basis (e.g. businesses could choose close stay open)? 

Did government anything help citizens? example, U.S., taxpayers got single relief payment unemployed folks received extra $600 per week benefits. Anything similar Japan? “It’s cheap real estate!” - Banks millionaires #shotsfired Everyone knows satire italics. pretty much become far right dogwhistle. this. A. Headline. ""The camp followed disinfecting rules required staff wear masks, campers wear face coverings. Health officials said “relatively large” groups kids slept cabin regularly sang cheered, likely leading spread.""

This seems irresponsible require masks. Also, parents send kids camp pandemic ? large part problem people willing need ....and instead, use time upset cannot want do.


In world that's ever changing, going either learn work smarter, work lot harder.
And someone working either one, sense complaints may have. 
These people become victim circumstances instead overcoming them.

This pandemic shake us awake.... break us apart.


I hope sake wakes us up. real?

 watcher/viewer newscast television show comedy-irony show expecting *truth* truthfulness. also expect reporters news desk research staff dig ferret truth read lines actually read example least abstracts scientific studies report on.

If difference live Sweden Europe. Everything area reasonable pricing disappear within days. Waiting evictions onslaught. like Gohmert, wearing mask got sick. fact responsible enough wear mask properly without touching face constantly. problem Gohmert's mask. problem behind slightly it. must exhausting redhat constantly defend indefensible, pivoting, deflecting, “they really meant really meant say that”, projection whataboutism. That’s really anymore. Winning! Costco employees several stores infected.  indication got work spread work.  much known point Lady, first rule Mask Fight... talk Mask Fight 100,000 employees, $1000... that's two weeks rent? got suspended I've get Covid tested missed much work. wait kid goes school Spiderman mask comes home Ironman mask wanted trade another kid.  alert school shut anyway. weird - like mental illness possibly. could rich Elon, insanely rich even notice making another *billion* dollars... aggressively push get people back work make *more money* show board keep company going expense thousands preventable deaths? 

Like insane want that. could literally never work day life again, yet he's going way get blue collar workers killed. antimask morons need brought heel. hurraagh evening.

There might even vaccine this. remember stating we'll vaccine summer. nothing yet. I'm saying never vaccine.

Just hurraagh evening.  Well always shop Lowe’s. employees thread, appreciate helpful always are. guess I’ll shop Lowe’s harder now? watches get posted 48 hours advance.

Aww, close connecting dots. watches get posted 48 hours advance? they're needed then! passed county's largest testing site they're cleaned 1600 today, none construction sites put things away yet. still time think preparations don’t get started official TS/hurricane watches warnings get posted

You think government agencies get started think need to? procedures deal events happen handful times every year? Every official action gated conditions. get started things season even starts we're caught pants down, bringing tents nowhere near top checklist. Swiggity swooty I'm comin free money punishment, Marlins wear masks times public. enough people honestly believed moon made cheese, Wisconsin would space program. impression get HCQ rubbish single treatment. like defending castle backdoor getting invaded main entrance. effect another drug blocks TMPRSS2 protease shame. hong kong well. virus fucking relentless. could April considered early? depends part government one listens day.  Public safety also affected 'the government' say.

Holcomb saying wear masks. sounds like good idea. 

But saying virus spreading quickly, there's enough testing test results often take long get. factors mean masks alone lower test positivity rate current 8.5% 5% goal supposed major indicator move forward, pause reverse re-opening.  short, governor saying, need go back Stage 2 reopening plan, would prudent thing do. lot people going get sick need risk hospitals becoming overwhelmed later year. 

Then noises governor making encourage counties re-open classrooms get parents send kids school. virus spreading current rate Indiana, recipe making lot people sick hurry. die. Many suffer long term health consequences. Encouraging classroom learning is, minimum, negligent Holcomb; believe downright reckless. So, subject, would good idea listen public officials saying. Again, find reputable source regarded news agency WSJ, CBS, etc. Thank service! narrative. always saving lives long term, anyone says otherwise paying attention. Fauci said many times. I’ve often thought law. Publicly traded companies payout certain number shares employees. profit sharing. BLEAK

wish people would fucking listen due diligence help stop thing spreading think musk trying optimistic much trying keep factories running. also history saying bizarre things knows.

edit: reference, looking bit more, also read musk refer covid19 version common cold. plainly attempt downplay it. common cold collection viruses, even coronaviruses, makes little sense compare novel coronavirus ones know less dangerous. indeed, we're still learning novel coronavirus systemic, multi-organ effects. would like calling original sars virus version common cold... nonsense thin veil technical equivocation.

musk's comments especially enlightened praise China coronavirus containment denounce genocide minorities.

The world isn’t black white.

Nazi engineers brought us moon. Americans dropped nuclear bomb. Thank service! I’ll leave also got utility workers, hospital support staff, plumbers, HVAC, wastewater workers, truck drivers, warehouse employees. 

I mean there's 300k HVAC techs alone America probably looked using place toilet paper People general sad ~6,000 deaths, 60% people still confidence CDC 80% still follow recommendations.
90,000 people die every year seems land year well difference excess mortality first half year average pandemic run course. really know yet immunity long lasting (~6 years immunity seems reasonable) vaccine takes time, think save lives long run.
Lockdowns cause things like children missing school, unemployment, domestic violence, depression, alcoholism, drug use terrible public health cost lives. longer takes vaccine, likely think saved lives long run. Even vaccine comes January think people agree decisions took time given never successful vaccine corona virus history.
The indicator worth suppose signs infections increasing countries opening lockdowns. many like can't afford ACA insurance. could go wrong?! foolproof plan consisting of, mostly, “teachers creative figure out.” hmmm pretty good handle it, better least. worries!

And obviously English better Maths!! receipts (video) stick (social media). Hold everyone accountable. make sure remember charge deciding senate open closed get money back mlb package cancelled. 

Does Shane Bieber get CY Young? Fuck, he’s incredible watch. sounds like saying closing things works Yes, myocarditis serious, inflammation heart god's sake. different yes, could get heart failure myocarditis. there's zero public evidence guy has. Oh gotcha. Yea sure, definitely stoked seems movement vaccine. me, that’s really way get back normal. economies better

He made fucking ass himself. embarrassing watch. shouldn’t even able speak someone intelligent Dr. Fauci.  embarrassment. Fucking nazi sociopaths. Wear mask, jesus christ Scientific research closer vaccine time. light getting there. related America’s Covid situation? It’s direct answer death tolls high we’ve coordinated national response. 

The front page filled posts government’s response.  Articles congress, HHS data issues, CDC director posts, front page right now.  

But one isn’t allowed?  agree Every day think maybe DeSantis pay attention now. Every day disappointed Floridian. sports TV help lot people stay home

Americans pussies. Fauci states truth matter cultists. They'll happily discredit believe demon sperm fish tank cleaner bi-partisan mean ramming veto proof super majority single Republican vote?  outdoor church gatherings shut down?

Edit: seems like have... It’s really messed bystanders completely ignored woman injured ground. understand hesitant attempt move get close walk completely ignore there? bullshit! 

Also, someone violent older frail (she cane god’s sake) woman disturbing. Really whole video disturbing many levels. Next weekend. WE'RE NUMBER 1!! That’s problem “capitalism.” focus companies increasing profits. Profits never stagnate absolutely never dip. It’s allowed go up. It’s incredibly absurd concept greedy assholes top can’t seem wrap heads around infinite growth impossible. keep cutting corners avoid paying people money bottom line eventually bubble going burst. time people struggling cost living, companies going harder harder time justifying paying employees scraps reporting MASSIVE increasing profits every quarter save click, it’s Alcoa High School, TN Oh that’s awful Exposing virus? virus needs exposed? Thank god there's backups. angle... true despicable self. Requiring returning residents quarantine help, especially first fines issued. least, businesses state departments able allow come back work vacations 14 days, significant bottleneck leaving 1st place. Lying would cost person 5 grand people start get sick result. Yeah, within hours. Florida also fire data chief? Florida dept health different organization? Serious question, well versed Florida Elon wrong.

Hail King Elon. Wow dare you. Ban incoming would listen either opinions corona virus? I’ll reply whomever want. Isn’t First Amendment great thing?

The 1st amendment nothing irrelevant message board. So, failed obvious fact, also failed figure OVERALL point exact numbers, showing trend EU well germany simply ONE example. 

You're nearly smart think are, thankfully dont listen anymore. insults even less impressive. BLOCKED Finally, advantage immuno-compromised. Elect new Sheriff's. Also, ridiculous sheriff elected position many parts US.

has net loss part right? keep pushing forward...so ready..but maaaaybe safe. Florida flying death chart, numbers continue week one top 4 states deaths. don’t. mom took one yesterday, it’s coming back Monday. don’t know covid shithole state you’re though. Pretty much every tech startup lot big west coast tech companies require insane hours employees. know lot people went work sector right college burnt within 3 years moved companies less ridiculous work schedules. I’ve also heard Tesla SpaceX exceptionally bad regard. news? seems pretty self-evident. 

Making *possible* people self-isolate test results come back...that's different issue. Oh please, keggers tailgate Plant Bamboo too. Probably say anything case Bill quit computers 20 years ago started largest private foundation world gave primary goal fighting disease. made using foundation fight disease primary occupation. Maybe stick disease fighting stuff get corona least? would also think people see cases rising, would responsibly take upon practice appropriate social distancing/masking. least would thought 2019. Now, all. Everybody licking doorknobs. story...
One sun-seeker, 18-year-old Lizzie Jones Portsmouth, beach dozen friends, said felt perfectly safe didn’t feel putting anyone risk. “We’re fresh air. People bit close don’t think there’s much danger,” said. 100 years virus research. best hope for. want rona? get caught outside. like want take risk going yet wear mask, willing roll dice further. Forcing people shit free feel incentive dumb way go selling idea. Nope, parent 3 equal. None wrong. Everyone different circumstances inform choices Two years? Moderna, Oxford, Pfizer laughing thought that. live several Tesla engineers like it. Lol, saying schools. county alright, food lit. area expertise failing tweet.

His area expertise technology, physics, astrophysics AI. medicine. talking about?

EDIT: Alright I've three identical replies 20 minutes [here's 

TL;DR - medicine ""just trends."" think accurately predict point virus stop permeating based little colorful lines maybe we're giving Dr. Fauci much credit. Elon know talking about, neither you. many laws books cops enforce, expect enforce this. think sees climate change bigger threat long run COVID calculated risk. gave house works hard shit man, it’s clearly money. results take 21 days come back selfish, basic survival. get shit ratings quality. sure considered good cars regards build. Staggering think people *still* don’t believe it’s real child can’t carry... That’s kind point, mitigation approaches now, masks physical distancing. used local level. It’s much less effective areas nearby these, better nothing. Yep. adults choice comfortable risk. choose teach, choose visit grandkids, etc.

Doesnt mean consequences choices, it. took little insight understand badly drawn-out pandemic would cripple economy. people charge simply thinking praying would go away. 

It reminds grade school finishing report. would sit back hoping teacher would never get me. sometimes worked particular day, eventually turn. sustainable solution put work.

To put another way, ""An ounce prevention worth pound cure"". Peaceful protests riots dumbass. learn one thing pandemic, better this:

Social distancing works events bars worst breeding grounds.

Everything else secondary. Ugh hopefully don’t lifelong health issues getting virus  I’ve noticed there’s big difference “smart” “well-learned”. Elon (""I want take world) Gates said is: yes, time makes difference saying thing always better look opinion expert ignore anyone else big name says. Sorry made clear Isn’t “certainty” risk? 20 year old forced work dangerous crowded conditions homeless, relate Business Insider vs Elon, father vs him. Business Insider interview. fact check father.

Character source , inconsistencies story , reason lying

That's I've tried show. Reasonable doubt. Way reasonable doubt. Perfectly fine, since lt. governor state says [us old folks willing sacrifice virus.  
 
Would somebody outside matrix please hit reset button already? want reality. Yeah would put scientist onto pedestal right instead dumb spicy billionaire boy knew virus would disappear April? Thanks info! great response, especially since Japanese tend focus greater good vs individual. U.S. federal government kind left states own, lot states failed come sort coherent plan. Also, mentioned before, U.S. culture focused individual rather greater society. cultural difference think also hurting us. Many people feel like wear masks infringing upon ""freedoms."" That’s I’m gonna report bar plaza. don’t approve they’re doing, bills pay lose everything. 

Unless agree society lockdown, right, shouldn’t close anything. local governments basically choosing one industry time punish insufficient results. Iceland stopped testing tourists Germany, Norway Denmark entering country. relaxation measures, sure call it. I’m vaccinated, I’m done this. group use masks. hardly comparable. Talk time backfires. they've made news... much attention need? new? getting 3rd $300 hazard check month top bonus. really need start condemning discouraging protests right now.

I’m cause double standard enabling idiots idiot drag longer.

And really protesting middle pandemic isnt best idea anyways. Failed States America. Right, links could find weren’t immediately denied due “being already submitted”. Yet couldn’t find anywhere sub. 

So dunno. surprise hostility exchange truly nowhere, haha. Classic reddit. pretty clear masks essential. report absolutely confirms implemented cloth masks campers opening windows doors increased ventilation buildings. Cloth masks required staff members Quarantined Y. M. C. A. means supply side economics vs demand side economics. Supply side says incentive people open customer discounts, customer sales come. big part right wing politics. Demand side economics instead says demand enough, government spend make demand recession. cannot tell people protest love expected one. think expect lot one. Wow people selfish can’t even that? victim propaganda. could easily name 20 countries I’d rather live in, top head.

Luxembourg japan Estonia Denmark Sweden New Zealand Finland Switzerland Norway Austria Belgium Iceland Czech Republic Uruguay Germany Portugal Italy South Korea Canada Finland 

Problem neither money resources move there, learn language culture, develop new relationships, start career scratch, kind immigrant they’d easily let in. Yankees closing pitcher tested positive far evidence spread team. going nation knees. I've staring dark horrible hole. Maine say?! Im Maine Cheerio! Care spot Covid19 old boy? Oh man. perfectly encapsulates society fucking broken. risking life loved ones worth paltry $1500?  Good find.

Thanks! Well he's spent time epsteins Island that's different type chilling. hard see assembling outside protest assembling outside chainsmokers concert? Looks like someone doesn’t know dont care, Google it, dont. Doesnt matter me.

lol look pathetic America. Thanks posting this. Lowes 2 minutes away homedepot me. Imma start going there! 60 hours sound bad kids. wife works healthcare used work 100 hours week sometimes kids.  ***The battle titans.*** agree, science denialism, family:(.

We need science communicators, can't become celebrities. 

I grew Herbert (a much younger) Bill Nye TV. Mr. Wizard bomber pilot Bill Nye mechanical engineer Boeing. could replaced brick smiley face painted it, shows science; move things along. loved science loved sharing it.

A good communicator background gives audience confidence ability, ability stay focused profession, love profession stay it.

The best science communicator currently Radia Perlman. household name, invented Spanning-Tree Protocol TRILL, improvement STP, along inventing part bunch things networking people appreciate. talks networking keeps field study, point describing upper layers OSI model ""boring"".

Stephen Hawking also really good, branch science somewhat reach common man, common scientist. 

Gordon Ramsay, foul-mouthed chef, probably exemplar need someone educate profession. He's got enough Michelin stars make constellation, passion profession help chefs, educate kids cooking, go back job get ass kicked, again.

They pushing degree, job title, name, achievements currently do.

Contrast Fauci, non-science job decades, done anything since work HIV, decades ago. He's manager shows politicians need ""expert"". Money fame. me, feeling sort loyalty towards Fauci actually feeling protective scientific medical community whole bc they're constantly thrown bus irrational assholes ranting newest FB meme proves everything conspiracy theory say followed required protocols? Yeah, one ones follow wear implemented cloth masks campers** opening windows doors increased ventilation buildings. Cloth masks required staff members I’ll reply whomever want. Isn’t First Amendment great thing?

Your posting cited Germany (in bold boot), sources. mentioned nothing EU countries. 

I don’t need impress anyone, especially twit like yourself. Got 2 stories place! interaction celebs, sort of.

Multiple vaccines needed anyway. also lot Evangelicals (and sects, like J-Dubs Adventists) resistant following Christ's commands actually making life better people Earth--feeding hungry, caring poor, etc. Apparently Earth holding pen anything prepare ascend Heaven whatever bizarre rituals particular sect advises, people (quite literally) damned.

It's shockingly narcissistic self-serving name Lord. Fred Rogers/Jimmy Carter/Oscar Romero-style Christian (albeit pottymouth), absolutely disgusts me.  I've heard show, want start watching going get canceled nobody knows it. like rolling convictions.

Gonna get actual ""so far good"" least hope that's case. deserve living wage minimum wage. corporations get away paying them. ends costing taxpayers money form subsidies.

Edit: say deserve house. would say safe housing. called GRIFTING, that's scumfucks doing. Poverty often leads poor health. Less healthy individuals likely dow covid. Pfttt haha aren’t forced bunch bullshit one thing county debate kept trying highlight *schools closed almost immediately March children quarantined.* course numbers lower them. exposed bringing home. caught family members bringing home. 

It's like point people make - proactive prevent issue, people complain big deal. reactive enough people complain made big enough deal. new information likely spread virus released CDC: 

- ""We detected COVID-19 11.8% household contacts; rates higher contacts children adults. risks largely reflected transmission middle mitigation therefore might characterize transmission dynamics school closure."" well ""We also found highest COVID-19 rate (18.6% [95% CI 14.0%–24.0%]) household contacts school-aged children lowest (5.3% [95% CI 1.3%–13.7%]) household contacts children 0–9 years middle school closure.""

And [this released Oxford centers around data earlier school closures. researchers found states closed schools later faced 5-6% increase mortality rates - every day remained open. 

- ""States implementing emergency declarations school closures later course pandemic experienced higher Covid-19 mortality, day delay increasing mortality risk 5 to 6%. effect size attenuated measured deaths per million, still consistent lower mortality earlier statewide declarations. knowledge, first demonstration association statewide social distancing orders mortality Covid-19. results support early social distancing nonpharmaceutical intervention reducing mortality.""

Just wanted drop here. yet I'd post another pika face response Hope nip cases bud explode. want know writing 2021 ..... Oh accidentally copy paste wrong thing, bot?

So edit comment back match one? else? buy term life insurance them? Yes percapita new thing people compare places different populations. 

If know, California populous state Union 40 million people. Florida half that.

So Florida 12 deaths per million California 4.3 deaths per million. think 12 bigger.

On top that, California's positivity rate 8 percent 7 day average Florida's 19 percent.

So yeah, California issues. wish even better, early hotspot still better Florida early hotspot.

So community spread first happened controlling.

Grow fuck up. It’s going come completely bubbled whole pandemic large-scale studies far show that, best, nothing, worst, increases risk heart disease. smaller studies shown benefits, since much smaller study size, they're quite reliable

Also, record, reason can't go Europe literally can't. let us anymore. USA currently death rate 465/million.

So could say every 10,000 people, 4 5 died Covid, it.

When think it, that's like 1 person every 10,000 people dying per month, last 5 months. Sure, lease language releasing parties contract case property sale.

Typical administration first article: yes every country reach herd immunity. goal every country world. reach full herd immunity need vaccine

Yeah, Tegnell Nature article specifically says:

#Each country reach ‘herd immunity’ [when high proportion population immune infection, largely limiting spread people immune] one way another, going reach different way.


Sure, constantly says one thing another. News 11. true say

#I think achieve herd immunity vaccine

However. Oh man, thanks grim chuckle. I’m angry, I’m wasting tears piece shit made living spreading misinformation put people’s lives danger. Good riddance. True, chemo wrecks body, including immune system. staying home precaution, say ""he deserved it"". Faster fake drug nothing. “placebo effect” phenomenon body thinks it’s given medicine, solve ailment been. essence, give tic tac tell it’s Advil, headache magically disappear. 

Even weirder still work person KNOWS they’ve given placebo.  obvious one. almost amusing watch Trumpists clumsily trying cover campaign lies misinformation, e.g. Fox News insisting never downplayed Covid called hoax. true, winds part development. there's much wind shear, storm struggle.

I'm sure tracking covid government entity would qualify that, seems like potential non legal perspective. Additionally, FERGA, tell, necessarily cover anonymized records, unless plans contact tracing, mainly needed anyways. end though, yeah, seems like choosing ignore it, means implement system admit that. kind really bad, dumb move overall would seem. Thanks heads up. another one add Spotify playlist ""complicating""

No. complicated. human? breath? carry virus. humans congregating? Increased risk virus. small humans? matter, they're humans... increased risk virus.

Shut down, HUMAN problem, political one. Sooooooo, saying blue crystals? Somebody vaccinating child building basketball court property owning chickens suburbs? 

I cant believe many people like one thing get. social distancing masks incredibly important need shut economy create many new regulations businesses must follow order stay open, would allow thousands people gather streets? many people wearing masks social distancing fucking laughable. top that, police using tear gas among irritants causes people cough (which spread virus lot more). everyone favor breaking protests merely reason?

Knowing antibody response generated obviously good step, ultimately vaccine effective actually provides immunity, evaluate see trial subjects catch disease Genuine question: ton vaccines still preclinical stages. I’m confused still moving forward them, like 20 human trials least one likely work. continue pour money vaccine isn’t gonna ready already multiple vaccines approved deployed Az higher data incomply bc one largest testing backlogs nation.

It mean wear mask get vaccination. hear ya. seen happen (to myself) too. study 100 recovered COVID patients Germany sobering upshot: months virus, hearts showed lingering damage virus. MRIs hearts found 78% exhibited visual signs virus impacted organ; 60% showed evidence inflammation. though none patients believed anything wrong hearts, per STAT. NBC News also notes none 100 pre-existing conditions would account heart damage, 67% patients mild cases coronavirus hospitalized illness. ""Our findings may provide indication [a] potentially considerable burden inflammatory disease large growing parts population,"" study authors What's unknown happens long term, editorial accompanying JAMA study, Dr. Clyde Yancy Dr. Gregg Fonarow write ""once heart muscle injured, potential progressive injury. ... see plot thickening inclined raise new evident concern cardiomyopathy heart failure related COVID-19 may potentially evolve natural history infection becomes clearer."" say ""generate additional anxiety"" hope spur analysis impact COVID heart. me, heart damage sound mild? tribe nothing morality. Grew church myself. really accurate. confusing, Evangelicalism US closely allied conservative politics, Evangelical conservatives whole appear contesting COVID-19 science.

But firstly, ""Evangelical protestants"" share belief absolute sovereignty God matters. That's belief associated Reformed Calvinist theology, Evangelicals Reformed. example, many Evangelicals believe salvation act ""free will"" exercised individual, Reformed Evangelical believes salvation act God individual nevertheless bears full responsibility repent obey God. ""free will"" view common American Evangelicalism.

Those Evangelicals *do* believe absolute sovereignty God believe human agency sovereignty God operate together way paradoxical nonetheless reality. So, example, Reformed Evangelicals jobs, go doctor, (if they're serious religion) good works. 

This Biblical - Paul said, example, ""That believed God careful maintain good works"" (Titus 3:8) insisted ""The one unwilling work shall eat"" (2 Thessalonians 3:10).

So ""Evangelical Protestant"" believes absolute sovereignty God spends life ""twiddling [their] thumbs [they] get heaven"" misunderstood concept God's sovereignty, they're step orthodox teaching it.

The so-called Christians America ""simply twiddling thumbs"" usually ones believe absolute sovereignty doctrine, ones believe [prosperity [faith found together pretty often American megachurches. 

These people think wealth wellness birthright Christians, they're likely less prevent spread coronavirus, ""literally believe control power event lives"" (which orthodox belief Christian denomination, even really weird ones), believe God either protect heal them.

People still contract impossible 100% efficient sterilizing everything come contact 100% time. nurses doctors work *known* covid patients day, remain safe. certainly possible right PPE. 

Schools providing KN95 masks, gloves, face shields, goggles, gowns teachers keep safe. Hundreds shutdowns across globe literally one (NZ) *maybe* eliminated virus, even they’ve close calls that. anybody look overwhelming data still believe lockdowns would saved lives? literally didn’t Hard argue one. would way different US join war.

And right, maybe early trial results good rest cancelled. That's fine. actually start trial first. Please use word tremendous, triggers lol Really. could helped yourself. this. Maybe keep denying it, go away.

I would rather 'never again' pandemic monument listed *every* US death (or, even, international death)... even create list people list victims know died, confirming death certificates.

If politicians think go radar absurd. Thry'll writing books decades. test, cases. track data, cases. Monkey see, monkey do.

You wrote:  people legitimate medical reasons wearing mask.  

Let's hear ""legitimate medical reasons"" alluded to. need advice. anxiety disorder, probably here. know, people good advice sane recommendations. 


Also belonging risk group, maybe. I'm 31, overall healthy (though best shape due anxiety/depression), sporty skinny. got asthma, trouble all. sore throat / throat inflammation, well take care precaution. Often go away threat carefully may got bronchitis. 


Also got 4 pneumonia 18. hardest 17/18 two times. Antibiotics mucho work via infusion. Ended getting rid shit lung Bronchoscopy. 


Luckily survived think lung take damage. guess, i'm cautious lung plague. Health hypochondry psychological topic before. 2014 fear heart, irrational. really much therapy got away panic attacks anxiety. Right now, like time again. trouble seeing therapist, indoor says take masks :S 


I'm living Germany, far good, though cases rising. like ""zero"" risk, home office, online university order groceries.  


Not sharing rooms indoor socialise friends outside enough distance. advised friend wear mask, anxiety, understand. 
Though last meetup said, fuck it, fucking outdoor, keep distance cases low. 


Right now, irrational fear going outside walk biking. especially fear ""shared"" staircase house. live 4th floor. 


But ridiculous think logically:  
Okay, infection risk higher indoor settings, but: 


\-people short time staircase. breathing out, sometimes bit heavier, goes up.

\-not mucho traffic there, neighbours active.

\-enough air volume

\-windows tilt 24/7 (though mean air refresh rate good) 


\+people infected before, emit enough virus well even though contagious / immunity, think walking triggers infection fast. 


I also wait going hear someone, like 15-30 minutes, that: \- 8-14 minutes 1 minute loud speaking WITHOUT air movement 


I really hate media saying probably hours air. never saw source that. Yeah, may stable air hours lab setting kept air (goldberg drum/cylinder) mean stays air long due physics air dynamics. (i saw calculations particle sizes max 10-30 minutes airtime sizes) 


What suggest safety go outside?  
FFP hard breathing 2 FFP2/KN95 valve (4 day rotation suggested), okay. Though breath heavily going staircase (that may case without KN95 too), well anxiety: fearing penetrate virus shit deep lungs. 


Also 2FFP3 without valve (they fit), dunno breathing going up. another FFP3 valve, dunno fit can't breathe properly, maybe sits tight noose breath. 


But dunno rotation needed, use like \~1minute going hours \~1 minute going in. Next day next mask repeat. 


Wanted use surgical mask fitted rubber bands outside. let breathe better. i'm sure ""protection"", mean - scientifically speaking think infection really really unlikely bycycling outside avoid crowds slipstream + keep distance. attack rate covid direct contact high short interaction R0 also roof. one would fear contracting influenza outside. 


Thought good surcigal masks protect wearer fitted, i'm sure right now. german politician recommends (Karl Lauterbach, virologist cautious). also links studies. also saw study german armed forces / ""Bundeswehr"" said, masks shit offer protection all, trust manufacters.  


Well, limiting exposure dose would starter overly paranoid feeling better guess.  


I also take care nasal mucosa supplement vitamin d, c zinc. eat better alot go + exercise outside. Ya clear, agree completely No. Look Southern tent revival revival tent meeting.

To answer question (posted also legladvice), here's gonna play out: 

1. going something stupid firearm yelling lack masks.  
2. cops going get called.  
3. Cops arrive, dogpile you, cuff stuff foam mouth ""self defense""  
4. receive court date.  
5. idiot bails jail.  
6. go home unknowingly take coronavirus you.  
7. develop severe symptoms continue ranting pay lawyer defend you.  
8. One night die home disease covid-19 caused virus caught thought smart.  
9. world goes without you.  
10. end. Wow would’ve thought? It’s almost like virus doesn’t care age damn mask doesn’t sh... Bryan. shout much u want Asia Times western newpaper? happened left Marshall San Francisco Thank link!!! letter clueless it’s embarrassment. propose broad, drastic, destructive economy, already see, proposing without proposing mechanisms handle political economic reality worse saying nothing. 

The US done broad lockdowns barring truly apocalyptic death tolls. Deaths likely reach level. people destitute who’s first priority surviving. 

The Republicans cultivated culture, cult-like, rejects attempts Feds states control lives like again. people comply, actively sabotage type mitigations.

Unless huge percentage US population change heart going ride thing out. See happens. sick time? sick time leave bank union? Teacher here. Also, yes, notarize health requests, too. F'in sad this! horrible choice:

Sent kids school risk getting sick, keep kids home cause loose vital education setting back life. 

Great. unpaid labor Wow. heartbreaking. How's condition extactly?  way feels like time passing days, that's another way saying December death toll likely around 400k bothe sides claim victory.

This actually part problem Evangelical Christians America. believe true, found anywhere Bible. Bible actually teaches mankind cannot save himself, totally reliant God things. 

A decade ago, religious researchers wanted find Millennials come back church. past 50 years, people would leave church shortly high school, come back 20s married children. happen Millennials, happening Generation Z.

[What researchers discovered Christians believe anything close Christian labeled new religion ""moral therapeutic deism."" unbelievably self-centered, nebulous pseudo consumerist religion. shocking finding youth become corrupted liberal colleges scapegoat church blames. found involved someone Evangelical church, likely believe it. taught pulpit. found ""liberal"" churches - found true every single Christian denomination, Catholic protestant Orthodox liberal conservative alike. 

""God helps help themselves"" actually classic heresy known pelagianism. denounced 1500 years ago church councils. ever heard reformation 1500s led Martin Luther Catholic church, pelagianism one major reasons reformation necessary. 

So extremist Christian nationalists fueling defiance masks social distancing - problem found church large, even liberal denominations. someone tells accomplish work God can, one step away taking place God Himself, they're beholden one: surrounding nation, people around them, certainly government. people fucking wear goddamn mask?? Spreading community people even know, resulting this!!! I'm angry country!!! husband lost dad similar way COVID. FUCK SHIT! people protesting taking time go get tested?

Many speculated SARS-CoV-2, pathogen causes COVID-19, accidentally escaped lab—a theory promoted U.S. President Donald Trump. even suggested could engineered there.

China forcefully rejected claims, Shi said little publicly—until now. 15 July, Shi emailed Science answers series questions virus' origin research. them, hit back speculation virus leaked WIV. colleagues discovered virus late 2019, says, samples patients pneumonia unknown origin. “Before that, never contact studied virus, know existence,” Shi wrote.

Compared what?

Compared 2019, yes. Compared 2017, yes. Compared 2018, maybe.

Compared 2000 1993 1988, absolutely not, years worse 2020 far terms total number deaths/capita.

You linked EuroMOMO, great, page compare excess mortality European countries. bump excess mortality Sweden 2020 size bump 2017 France 2018 Spain 2018 Scotland.

You make sound like excess mortality Sweden 2020 kind unique disaster, barely makes top five last couple decades. what's complicated debate..?

This isn’t merely academic since reason live fear losing great job (with 5 figures student loan debt) lonely miserable last 6 months good reason. Okay, let's say happened decent, actually prevented multiple attacks. Would alright checkpoints then? 60 days protesting? Doubtful glad much better! rough day today! kind surprised last two manageable. thought mend.

Good luck brigade.. need 30 accounts catch old news..

Dont forget copy paste excuses  contagion works. People spread disease spread risk ALL, albeit practice safety reduce risk *somewhat.* Karen protest schools stay open. Isn’t production companies pay employees? It’s like pocketed.

Oh wait, actually already happened. actually put Japanese people concentration camps. Horrifying. Yeah BUT........at least stick around self-cannibalization. No?

I’m annoyed particular commenters hypocrisy, bitching regular posters similar thing another thread. deleted comments got downloaded hell.

I’m assuming they’re trolling things post “fun” drama subreddit‘s seem spend lot time in. think people manage corrupt Taoism Buddhism. people practice Buddhism giving donations monasteries. form Taoism focused achieving physical immortality paranormal powers.

The last one spread it, possibly original Asian strain possibly virus particularly contagious someone convalescing long. Still, could someone ""coming something"" sent school way, especially sick? course happen.

People gonna people. People people'ing lockdowns came first place. take long all. There's absolutely fucking chance listen he's trump lap dog through. doesn’t add didn’t take hydroxychloroquine zinc like Trump said...doesn’t make sense. It’s school districts.

That’s read sentence. 

Also, never heard before. Thank sharing. biggest problem kids go school, bring germs multiple different households, spread around among themselves—whether getting nose snot friends, breathing virus particles air—and take home multiple different households.

That end “something going around” every fall. kids inherently germy less hygienic grownups. I'm mistaken there's 200m ppl difference us. I've said they're going dispose us jobs pay us, would've rather kept economy open 🤷‍♂️ Intelligence agencies releasing information it’s ongoing investigation. That’s hardly proof part discredit it. Hes obviously talking reporting numbers waaay before.

It spreading rapidly throughout fizzled out, new virus grows exponentially country billion people, known cure 4000 people died? Yeah bullshit. wish people would stay focused could protect one another instead trying politize situation finding in. thing aint joke. still able walk cannot get physical therapist come assist me. fear never walk again. ones need step watch one another. still able figure became infected first place. home body leave home unless absolutely necessary. stumped health care professionals trying track source passed virus me. strange series events taken place.

Sure maybe outliers actually care people serve, types politicians rare. July 28, 2020 - [A meta-review systematic reviews updated meta-analysis efficacy chloroquine hydroxychloroquine treating COVID19 

Abstract
Abstract Background urgent need efficacious safe treatment COVID19. Several trials testing variety therapeutics on-going. in-vitro studies found anti-malarial drug chloroquine (CQ), derivative, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), effective COVID19. However, systematic reviews meta-analyses clinical trials humans produced conflicting findings efficacy safety drugs. Guidelines vary considerably hotly debated political scientific levels. Therefore, become necessary provide summary effectiveness safety drugs treating COVID19 infection, using overview existing systematic reviews meta-analyses. Objective synthesize findings presented systematic reviews meta-analyses well update evidence using meta-analysis evaluating efficacy safety CQ HCQ without Azithromycin treatment COVID19 infection. Methods design meta-review followed Preferred Reporting Items Overviews Systematic Reviews including harms checklist (PRIO-harms). comprehensive search included several electronic databases identifying systematic reviews meta-analyses well experimental studies investigated efficacy safety CQ, HCQ without antibiotics COVID19 treatment. Manual searches reference list included studies citation search top 20 papers supplemented search. Findings systematic reviews meta-analyses reported using structured summary including tables forest plots. updated meta-analysis experimental studies carried using distributional-assumption-free quality effects model. Risk bias assessed using Assessing Methodological Quality Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) tool reviews MethodologicAl STandard Epidemiological Research (MASTER) scale experimental studies. main outcomes meta-review updated meta-analysis were; mortality, transfer intensive care unit (ICU), intubation need mechanical ventilation, worsening illness, viral clearance occurrence adverse events. Results total 13 reviews 40 primary studies comprising 113,000 participants included. primary studies observational (n=27) rest experimental studies. Two meta-analyses reported high risk mortality similar ORs 2.5 HCQ Azithromycin. However, four meta-analyses reported contradictory results two reporting high risk mortality (OR ~ 2.2 3.0) two reporting significant association HCQ mortality. reviews reported HCQ without Azithromycin significant effect virological cure, disease exacerbation risk transfer ICU, need intubation mechanical ventilation. exclusion studies meet eligibility criteria, updated meta-analysis contained eight experimental studies (7 RCTs 1 quasi-experimental trial), total 5279 participants 1856 either CQ/HCQ combined Azithromycin. CQ/HCQ without Azithromycin significantly associated higher risk adverse events (RR 5.7, 95%CI 2.4-13.7, I2 =55%, n = 5 studies). HCQ effective reducing mortality (RR 1.0, 95%CI 1.0-1.2, I2 =0%, n=6 studies), transfer ICU, intubation need mechanical ventilation (RR 1.1, 95%CI 0.9-1.4, I2 =0%, n=3 studies) virological cure (RR 1.0, 95%CI 0.9-1.2, I2 =55%, n=5 studies) disease exacerbation (RR 1.2, 95%CI 0.3-5.0, I2 =29%, n=3 studies). **Conclusion conclusive evidence CQ HCQ, without Azithromycin effective treating COVID-19 exacerbation.** Bless kids. Somehow think people forget? Thank kindness. someone love ever end similar situation hope nurse like around. sad part know people... still think that. Totally bonkers.   problem modern identity politics making wrong things part *who are* feel need double ignorance rather actually learning mistakes proceeding new knowledge. US...

Ok dog sniff. *5 seconds later*. covid.

That $2,000. Let's say warned ""fire hot. Fire kill you."" go around telling everyone ""Fire hoax!"" ""Fire can't hurt you!"" actually spend lot time encouraging people douse gasoline fire real. president country actually use executive power stop people warning others fire dangerous. also de-funding fire departments put fire waste money since fire hoax. time fund herbal supplement supposed GREAT putting fires (that also real, making sense exactly forte).

Then one day douse gasoline light fire get hurt even die.

Why exactly feel sympathy you? hurt willful malicious ignorance simultaneously trying hurt others way. Third world countries first world money fucking awesome. get mansion house staff East Africa middle-class American income. can't use bedroom? Bootlickers trying hard justify drug already August many Americans think stock outside retirement accounts percentage total assets think equities comprise?

A drop markets would certainly hurt Americans, cases would paper losses. Last week, 30 million Americans underfed. Millions unemployed facing eviction. There's much larger social impact there's solution help crowd. print money float markets float lower middle classes directly. need amendment regarding nepotism “The final analysis included 604 participants U.K. answered questionnaire April 7 April 30, 2020.

Ogden found 80 percent participants experienced changes quickly perceived time passing lockdown compared pre-lockdown. older less satisfied current levels social interaction likely experience slower passage time course day week.”


Would like see survey done broader demographics Heads up, 2 things read article 
1. kid tested well school started states school notified results health department, student already nurses office. 
2. (at point) even going shut school down, asking anyone came direct contact student come back 14 days. suspected contacted school health dept. 


W...T....F...?? Yeah, US here.. last 7 months felt like 7 years. talk “back March” feels like forever ago. transparent, seem think poor people problem, like problems refuse fix  never lockdown though. really strict testing tracing program. Oh man I'd love see trump promote Thank you! thinking thing us school starts early September. Whats July crap about? knowing I'd end up, pray I'd make right choice again.

Alliser Thorne debate cannot get complicated, actually quite simple:


You pile studies studies, people believe science, size pile matter one bit.


For part, I'm glad studies actually done, already know do: mask, wash, protect people especially kids... I'm hypothesizing pre-existing cell activity caused Covid infections asymptomatic. Badgers rock!!! guess not. country stick fork 240v electric outlet tried 120v hurt really bad. 

That stupid opening schools is. Hermann Cain stupid, ignorant. knew well arguing for. School class email lists. Nextdoor app. poll? im boutta make drop 37% Krokodil Also used sugar least likely die holy shit works, none died!  made point common-sense framework Redditor posted kinds links things Europe said kids didn’t transmit it. 

I rolled eyes. know sometimes common sense preexisting paradigms actually disproven science, things obvious go again. Proving COVID-19 isnt one knocks, Walt is. NY got hammered, residents adjusted took precautions. Texans hellbent playing chicken disease. comment seems paradoxical. um...lung transplant? um....what? false positive. Furlough ends UK October, we’ve done kick van road.  administration won't.  hopefully new one will. Hoosier 4 kids 4 different schools due ages grade levels. kids online option. Trying minimize exposure risk much possible. IT. 3 Districts. 7+ years. 200+ schools. dusty corners. Never got sick. think built strong immune system fight covid20. worrying part giving others silently. Suprise advance Christmas gift lol  Yes, one beakers, err, mean Beaker. X-Files first movie simply phenomenal television. get then. one wants people physically remove non-mask wearers. refuse serve them. Welcome parents screaming top lungs amounts institutionalized day care. common complaint hear “I can’t afford stay home!” solution? Send kids school. Little Timmy sniffles? It’s probably nothing go class, meeting get to. 

Fast forward complaining school shut back Covid. Would different outcome though? We'd finding lived anyway. old people people co-morbidities risk...it's 1.8% fatality rate (less measles), anyone saying 'OH COVID IM OK' ....attention. celebrities first place, endless need attention.

Which give them, admittedly happily. family still two upcoming weddings. speak participating already got told unfair basically. interested. Yeah that's surprising. liked give shit died either Heartstring tugging brainwashing. use public bathrooms I'm working making calls everyday.

I always wear N95 mean, though? remember following news, ""Hey China, sucks them"", ""Damn Italy's got it, that's tragic; could never happen here"", even now, ""Wow, NYC got hammered, still alright, wont happen here."" back 1k+ deaths per day (underreported mind you) people gall say ""Were fine, lib hoax"". fuck people smoking? 5 years gonna see full tally going wrack brain. get saying want stopped enter store. manager would implement order keep employees safe?

I'll play gotcha game. know underage? seen 21 year old look 16 one's look almost 30. Forgetting ID law, neither refusing show it. Ask see ID see say. doubt admit buying underage. wearing mask obvious.

In state could attempt buy cigarettes underage officer could ask see ID. show even give name. reasonable articulable suspicion belief reasonable person suspect violated law. worked gas station call cops attempted underage purchases. way prove underage. Wow, epidemiologists scientists predicted pandemic since epidemics different diseases seen emerging year year. 

Extremely suspicious. workers high risk environment. ones working infected patients almost certainly get they're using N95 masks.

Go back read wrote figure they're wearing face shield surgical mask n95. solution problem? whole warehouse size football stadium stocked something better N95s? Maybe N99? N100? P100? not, face shield best option extra protection act barrier. high risk environment surrounded people know fact it?

I currently live south governor redneck POS refusing make mask mandatory. course, let's forget lovely people wear them. That's n95 nanofibers surgical mask it, goggles, polycarbonate face shield provide higher level protection.

To spend time see people hanging around nearby, like wear sunglasses O2 silicone/plastic respirator disposable filter. Sweat disposable masks work well together. 

If leave house work knowing clients work hospitals labs, bet I'm going wear P100, goggles, nice polycarbonate face shield like today office doctor hospital Covid patients. going grocery store gassing car?

How cute. Prob seabass Looks like candy, taste like saltiest salts maybe battery acid hear. studies works given early symptoms zinc. already hospital. I'm glad fine again. U smrt. mayor Didn’t Jack Dorsey donate billion dollars? Use money feed pissed. show bunch trailer, he’s show like five minutes. ridiculous crazy good listening subtle performance dude Mr. Show scene GOAT.
Odenkirk really makes scene ring true lucky It’s joke dimwit Already posted. many deaths nursing homes? district going students online, faculty teach onsite. teachers freaking child care they're forced come work.  facinating think it.

Think really terrible personality traits encounter people.

Then realiase long humans around... little horrendeous traits appear mattered fight reproduce.

Stupid exists apparently, there's ""enough"" smart offset burden tribe. Omg even live u white Yeah, Orange Dumb able accept it. text see stated? where.? Oh okay. Covid-19!! He'll get Grammy bet would 1% fans die? Muppet movie? 🤣 I'm sure comment comes like trying downplay it.

Better treatments etc. (and have) definitely help, yes. part smart continue vigilant medical professionals learn care improves.

But... counter point is: people can't get treated (and treated proper care, doctors said disease takes nuanced, individualized attention best fight individual) due lack beds, staffing, lack ventilators; matter well KNOW treat it; death rates higher be.

Edit: sort one step forward, one (three?) step backward scenario may facing. Thank demonstrating ability perform simple division

Now tell significance numbers? cannot point continuing discussion would appear value add conversation Source? left heels office. House slippers wfh win. What’s that? watch movie. mean like Ben Carson? Lol know feel. go really far back get someone worth shit. Probably nothing stock market pump dump. TX shut yet? bad census already sent out. southern states populations might dropping point, think demon sperm credibility.  /grabs popcorn pulls seat

This article doesn’t lot substance. That's setting bar pretty high welp that’s unfortunate. Personally don’t think it’s time day start drinking it’s quantity effects life. single drink 11am isn’t somehow worse 11 drinks 8pm. school ~~[900 apparently, tiny compared large ones urban areas.

Edit: no, see response. [745 Walter White tryna stay safe lab chemicals tho.. like thalidomide wildly ignorant.

The Koch Foundation one global leaders ""funding science"" prevent curbing fossil fuel industry. thought ironic somebody called whole sociology article, highly respectable field general, racket. saw article colossal conflict interest. fact calling good thing shows clue talking about.

I would never use article funded Charles Koch Foundation publications. rhinoviruses ...what’s proper way get rid virus we’re attempting do...? bout x files ep?  Unemployment laid off. don’t get quit fired cause. health insurance yes would pay whole hospital bill. get cobra continues previous health insurance job loss it’s expensive. It’s meant temporary bridge till find something else. doctor urologist point exactly. never serious effort  hospitalized 10 days put oxygen concentrator 3 days. asked administer hydroxychloroquine ... doctor said try avoid using till got critical. said really garanteed people still die even using it. covid basically throw bunch antibiotics stuff pray body responds. Neither HCQ anything really works everyone. Everybody responds differently virus medications. given choice economic collapse mass deaths. chose mass deaths, economic collapse. Ughhhhhh. Ya think? Good. Let burn let’s try building something far reasonable. Fox News killed parents. They're still alive, technically. petsmart start Covid training program?

I know, right? well good, would useful *my* dog could it... NY told social distance wear masks treatments. Shame FL learning NY mistakes. Action meet consequence.  could avoided catastrophe even implemented shutdown way NJ NY initial invasion. would still much ask though. Ancient beings much power absorb mean pandemic eternal. vaccine, major issue long. ""Do know much meth ventilator costs?!"" Ghosts. definitely ghosts. places quit fired ""with cause"" qualify unemployment. Even get payout abysmal. [My state one worst.] worst, historically present, North Carolina. end 2019 — economy humming pandemics stuff horror fiction — fewer 1 10 jobless people North Carolina received unemployment benefits. That’s lowest rate country well average maximum number weeks someone state draw benefits currently 12, compared national standard 26 weeks. receive benefits get less money used to: 2008 2019, percentage worker’s wages replaced fallen 53% 38%. North Carolina also ranks worst state getting benefits workers timely manner.

Mitch McConnell ensure empty threat. person internet, makes expert! Like everyone else!

/s benefited greatly learned treat virus based work done hospitals.

I think they're saying learned treatment methods. 

I seen anyone argue yet learned anything else, like let virus run wild. think could make argument. virus making everything much harder ever needed be. 

As viruses wont do. :-) get i’ll get one, idea freaks America Great Again? Thats great news can't pandemic without celebrities Shit, while, seemed like Japan spared. flaring there, Hong Kong, South Korea, even Vietnam China starting flare again. stupid virus going keep get vaccine guess. also 70k ""natural"" deaths estimated, linked virus anything.  UArizona president, who's doctor, plowing full force ahead [opening less 3 weeks.

Note latest briefing cherry-picks data local county, ignores state trends. country literally stupid live Pearlene Parcell's ""friend"" Ron 30 Rock? seemed learned lot know. agree Kochs, preaching choir. 

You must also know research funding involves obligations funder. Foundations commonly give grants without strings. worth noting potential conflict interest, that's guarantee. gain finding Christian Nationalists oppose public health precautions anyway? 

What notion survey studies racket they're paying participants? I'm following. long arguing people Reddit today? makes lot sense. really thought odd got upvotes saying ""need minimum wage workers."". made comment underpaying overworking teachers leads minimum wage workers.

That happen Norway either though.

It surprising though, main thing people like Tegnell Giesecke talking international media long time all. ""Stockholm herd immunity next month"" repeated moving goalposts, almost country's infectious disease authorities talked herd immunity way _we know enough still don't_. Exactly.
And without pandemic every experiment shown people generally want work.. 
just maybe abusive jobs bad leadership/colleagues shitty pay. Dont worry going mess up. live Ontario came said children grade 1-8 go school full time, grade 4s mandatory masks 1-3... high school half class half remote...

Every realize decisions could kill countless people, throw half measures make profit centric decision making seem humane, mainly eyes media.

Basically end priorities hopelessly fucking confused whole thing becomes shit show.

 priority human life now, drive every decision, covid response going similar systemic genocide also said couple months ago Sweden role model. Unlike Canada, Sweden enforce harsh lockdown, nearly 70% deaths occurred nursing homes; similar Canada. Yeah that’s tested specific strain corona, deemed effective.

Last week, Vietnam effectively banned wildlife trade, amid fears trafficking exotic fauna might precipitated emergence latest outbreak. Vietnam consumer illegal wildlife products transit point endangered animals destined China across shared mountainous border.

With clarity source outbreak Danang, infected least 26 people there, medical authorities racing figure cases proliferating supposedly closed country.
The health ministry said strain virus detected Danang different ones circulated earlier round local transmission.
“This imported,” said Professor Nga, public health expert Quang Trung University. “A virus cannot survive three months community without causing illness.”
Professor Nga said thought virus likely arrived Vietnam late June early July.

In Danang, police fanned across city, trying locate outsiders might brought virus them. Saturday, police apprehended nine Chinese nationals sneaked Vietnam illegally, local authorities said. Dozens Chinese entered country illegally nabbed earlier month central Vietnam. Chinese man, police said set illegal immigration network, arrested Monday.
The Chinese caught either put quarantine camps isolated hospitals, police said.
Across Vietnam, hospitals getting beds ready handle rise cases. Professor Nga noted ventilators equipment needed fight coronavirus limited Vietnam.

People, said, become complacent.
“After 100 days outbreaks, people weren’t taking precautions anymore,” Professor Nga said. “They weren’t wearing masks cleaning hand soap. People going crowded places.”
In Danang, Nguyen Thi Minh Hoa, director marketing firm, said grocery shelves emptied en masse, meaning residents anxious panicked. Renewed social distancing measures followed carefully, said.
“I’m sad coastal city suddenly become center disease 100 days peace,” Ms. Hoa said. too. like we're Lemmings reading go cliff diving.  Yikes literally drove past construction two days ago. Scary think drove past multiple people covid. Canada done well saying? reason expected higher several prefectures reported numbers yet, including Osaka, Kyoto Saitama, prefectures given partial count, major cities finished counting yet (like Fukuoka).

Update: According current figures, Japan currently 1,482 new COVID-19 cases, beating yesterday's record, 1,301. total number eventually get higher numbers come in. lives Canada now, right? Like said would trump election? Nah, really great Doctor president USA specially mentioned supports said sexual thoughts we'll give birth demon babies. Remember security theater AKA TSA?
This Health Theater... numbers decreasing since April, summer months could sure effect too. like swedes solo lake, reports e.g. Öland Gotland crowded tourists.

I mean, I'd love get back yelling old political stuff right even radical sides (not extremists) would argue sound reasonable. Flag pap. inter-stall foot tapping thing past? Vermont too.  There's reason well quarantine. look studies.  Love Malcolm Middle That's immune systems work. novel virus, anything else managed fight irrelevant. flu multiple strains per year vaccine gets big ones also flu vaccine rates rarely reach heard immunity levels.  Man I'm still kinda pissed film. marketed like majority it. appreciated take monster movie, felt cheap promote Cranston dies first quarter lmao India really getting anything control. pretty much fucked. Yeah, I'm counting 100% back normal year. think 2021 defined return normal process spanning good portion year. animals catch it. Even transmission 'seemingly low' still putting people risk otherwise would safe? could dog smell something you? Also big fan intentionally putting animals harms way. done safely parties. going break news Cousin Greg?  Looks ticket: 832,234

A months ago read “healthy” teen died Covid, read article, could see child easily 300 pounds. article said blood sugar sky high admitted him. Someone told covid caused that, seemed family didn’t understand kids get type 2 obesity since mom said son healthy.

Read guys comment history That's exactly put first line , good point could made whole lot better much clickbait  People take stuff posted social media/news outlets run generalizations.

One would think state almost averages 10k cases well week, people would take upon wear masks practice safety protocols, even state telling so.

Sure, *are* probably people still anti-mask trying go lives COVID real, stage, they'd absolutely minority. still suffer effects testing negative false negatives....

Covid also tanks immune system, secondary infections totally plausible well. One coworkers got nastiest case strep throat recovering covid. fine now, rough couple months.

Lung damage reducing oxygen intact, leading fatigue, too. good enough reason ~60% Americans. Exactly, *did* tick states reopened. It’s truly baffling people look lackluster effects first lockdown coupled destructive second-hand effects say “nah let’s even forcefully”. Definition insanity right there. Lockdowns don’t work worldwide proof Agreed, especially we’re wearing equivalent shirt faces, said use whatever fabric available cover faces. fucking moron, thread 200,000 dead TOTAL throughout pandemic cruised past 150,000 less 60 days. think that’ll put us next 60? 200,000

So absolute tosser like shriveled dick are, upset “leading” infectious doctors obviously wrong prediction was? 

Ps go duck teacher goes back soon 4x full days week, hazard pay? America leader Biden elected America appreciates teachers, pay more.

I see argument I'm sure hard people understand teachers paid little.

1. paid tax dollars, means already difficult get things system
2. (More 1B) People complain tax dollars spent things use every day (likes roads bridges), imagine trying convince town people double teachers salaries 60%-70% children school system
3. People like receive something tangible value money-something look hold something draw direct line intangible use capital tangible desirable result. point example Ivy league schools, listing teachers consistently put high % students top level colleges almost guarantee parents children would willing pay far make sure child gets education, see value. Problem obviously cannot grade teachers (in fact cant grade teachers ALL) **and** every parent cares kid goes top level school.
4. obvious reason is: teachers it! work shit wages year year, people come school teaching degrees take terrible pay. simple economics, schools pay teachers less despite paying entry level machine worker, jobs get filled. Then, jobs get filled, teachers work harder continue educate kids, thus making demand teachers year year decrease.
5. Finally, unions suck, conflict interest comes getting teachers everything want right away, would teachers need them? instead fight little here, little claim that's negotiation do, thing next year year that.

Overall crazy teachers get paid much, like kids summer camp counselors make less minimum wage: mean literally would protected people's children weeks woods one batted eye paid 6 dollars hour. complain knew collectively could've left camp would've needed close paid enough get staff stay, didn't. could always stock LOW, know. like super elite allowed make Robinhood account. Also profits really go shareholders, they'll paying $415 million dividends shareholders quarter. quarter, that's equal they've paid employee bonuses. Tenants lost jobs quarantine, won’t evict gave free rent 2 months. already done, government programs help recover costs USA? fines 10x bigger shutdown day two get message No, always send letter home student found contagion. send home letters head lice, flu, scarlet fever, mono. 
Do form letter staff student death ready go? one might hardest write, better get typing. unacceptable. government respond appropriately save lives? people rise demand it? Demand lockdown UBI 2-3 months. Whole foods team member here. Extra $2 ""not hazard pay"" ended June 1st despite TMs still tested positive COVID-19 still take extra precautions like temped expensive several thousand dollar FLIR thermal cameras beginning every shift. also happens unreasonably hot summer lot parts country, nobody actually consistently temps 100.4/101 degrees first come in, entire thing little moot begin with.

We get $500/250 bonus, still make losing $2 pay differential.

This whole thing real cool. Literally except maybe mask mandate unconstitutional, quit entertaining unrealistic pipedreams. It’s useless. Maybe would’ve worked, never option. don’t live totalitarian state like China (though sounds like maybe you’d prefer did). Even so, you’d issue keep borders sealed, would’ve impossible, virus would seep back (Mexico control virus one potential source) we’d trouble later line reinstate lockdowns again, likely. US response bad uncoordinated, feasible. Pretty ignorant. I've always heard Lowes decent place work for.

I worked Home Depot briefly college far worst job ever had. refuse shop Home Depot it. Texas 300 dead yesterday!!!! That’s shit ton bodies cheered Herman Cain died. hope there’s more. Fucking wfm lol. must every damn call center warehouse country. Fuckers used change lunch breakfast 3-4 times one day, sometimes hour away before.

Oh yeah I'm working 9-6 would love first break 9:30, lunch 11 last break 1. Perfect, thanks 5 straight hours phone break 😂 man fuck call centers places like Amazon can't even go piss need to. There's plenty reasons regret 46% people's votes 2016 really honest question bait - things happened:

- many places around world (US), flattening curve effective lack willpower leadership implement effective mitigation. early proponents flattening curve hoping things ultimately happen, like widespread testing + tracing capabilities (countries relatively better).

- spread become widely distributed many places test + trace longer realistic, longer possible halt virus progress - repeatedly slow various public health measures like social distancing.

- Since can't eliminate virus way, vaccine *de facto* option point. reason believe herd immunity could achieved shorter timespan lower cost.  sub-standards completely agree stupid conspiracy theories general, 2nd one seems true. Multiple news outlets reported it. happen, well dumbest/most terrifying thing ever hear. someone goes get tested assigned number que. Say 15th list 40 getting tested day. let's say waiting 4 hours decide give leave. Well number 16 que becomes 15th person tested. KEEP NAME ATTACHED NUMBER 15. means every result 1 person leaves incorrect setting chain results incorrect. number 16 tested positive get letter saying tested positive number 16 effectively took test you. number 17s results get sent 16. forth. Get antibody test.  let know it. Yes, US's system also short sighted selfish. People reflect culture.  What? Tokyo couple hundred deaths. dense city!

The topic discussion defined title article. America, comparison countries. Therefore, suggesting first comment NY proof states could obtain similar results shut businesses. title, down, start over, right - open letter **America’s decision makers**, behalf health professionals **across country**.

Even comparing two cities, exposed different strains virus dont actual comparative numbers international travel, traveled numbers. dont deny people east habitual mask wearers meticulous. Americans, comparison, way carefree. going every day? Construction supplies? We're living loop, learn anything Spanish Flu. guess makes trying keep COVID positive employees telling employees. well quarantining exposed employees. /s 
We found coworkers positive returned back work sent home 2 weeks, even though us spent hours every day test. store manager would communicate positive employees state post social media keep quiet ""cause panic"" store. happened many stores I've spoken with. I’m shocked there’s lot medical students photos right thick things - NY basically stopped med students (and clinical students) coming got really bad, eventually led volunteer come back function almost residents. hope it’s volunteer basis least cause they’re literally paying tens thousands dollars risk lives. least looks like good PPE central issue - GOP trying force Dems agree holding actual stimulus provisions (unemployment payments, checks everyone, eviction moratorium extended) hostage get desire.

The Dems caving yet. Use Lowes whenever possible, Home Depot run terrible human Yet.

Yet. Ah see I'm elimination school thought.

Lockdown hard fast like NZ. reopen amazing contact tracing self isolation rules, REALLY good that, get cases almost nothing, nothing.

Bonuses always taxed higher. one's knowing bonuses work, scheme Amazon give less.

Looking country whole useful understanding things going individual states. even individual regions within states. Unfortunately that’s need multiple countries vaccine. It’s great one company develops one many able give won’t even cover percent world weeks ago, I'd heard Japan great, chalked culture accepting wearing masks.

There substantial fuckery afoot Cuomo v Nixon fight. boys upset “superior” country fared much worse country happily call “third-world shithole”. go around spread lies feel better. sort twisted reality coping mechanism. recently stated “second wave” — unlike flu, Cov-19 seasonal. So, likely see second wave winter. That’s good news.

The bad news one global unending wave, spiking due openings closings local compliance protocols effective vaccines widely plentifully available 😣 test staff people. Obviously 2000 odd cases week, hard fill 100k weekly testing capacity. obviously tests cost neighbourhood 200-300 usd each.

And claiming mass shootings. incidents mass casualty events. Seems like prefer people get shot opposed people who's job enforce law.. actually enforce it. cashier's job fuckin' police store weapons, kind dystopia live in, especially never brought mass shootings. advanced nation earth! Lol. mean.... Duh

Anyone cruise ship know better, Europeans think immunity something answer jail fuckers reckless disregard got business conditions continue worsen Don’t need anything still going shop Lowe’s show support. highly suggest link studies supporting argument. linked respectable article simply said “No, doesn’t seem reasonable me” waved off. Yeah, going work.

Find studies Denmark’s, Norway’s, Finland’s seropositivity get back continued discussion waste time places junior high middle school primary/elementary school high school. 

Traditionally speaking high school would senior high contrast junior high, that's even less common junior high.

Most seem middle schools days live junior highs converted middle schools. Delivery driver here, amount maskless people deliver like ""It's okay, it"" appalling. vs party could care less? Hot cold also temperature still wouldn’t say cold boils water.

Heh, like that.

Question, though. Redfield head CDC also presidential appointee. I've read lot believe rightful criticism role current situation we're in. know much let's say he's really partisan like lot current appointees. Would still able trust CDC? also know probably hundreds thousands others work CDC hard work. nothing person gets disseminate data biased way instead throwing hard numbers. favorite argument people say covid reported take covid deaths 28% deaths last 4 months average. That's subtract reported covid deaths. means covid indirectly directly killed far reported. live Alabama people hate math usually lose 28%. factor excess deaths....

Just one country world war 2 happen today united states would ceded Hawaii Japan applauded Hitler invaded London.

This probably truest statement ever read. tested child, would it. attempt extortion Republicans.  want liability protection returning workers wealthy corporate masters, force workers return even pandemic raging sue employers keeping safe. GOP strategy ""support economy"" (meaning friends) ""re-opening"" country (ignore pandemic people die want keep getting cash).

The GOP think agree Dems cave sympathy people lose lifelines, they'll get liability protection, really amounts ability corporations cause workers' deaths without penalties.

Pelosi company stated liability protections non starter betting public understand really causing pain, they're caving. IMHO, right thing do.  People getting evicted bad, corporations killing people without even paying medical bills far worse.

There's lot going GOP trying get tax cuts extra pork. I'm optimistic available Thanksgiving. Atleast oxford one, probably widely available, but...

Everyone wants stay home isolate needs provided vaccinated. Anyone wants go functions involving large crowds, avoid wearing masks, go church, go work, etc may things freely long distance people chosen isolate themselves. Even intentionally infect people. Allow morons kill stupidity open gotten better died. Ass ass! Ass ass!
(Requiem dream style) hope correct France. thing worry combination two things:


1. 54% increase new cases last week. it’s third week row. R-value 1.4’ish. trend wrong direction serious, even low numbers. 

2. French Prime Minister Jean Castex ruling new lockdown economic human consequences total lockdown disastrous,


These two things collide big way. Let’s really hope doesn’t.  ""unwantingly touched"" phrase scary parent. kinda daycare place? lawyer approve form, name shame awful person one trusts them. either take seriously ahead time, wait take seriously later.

You spelled ""adults critical thinking skills"" kind funny here. Covid 19 coronavirus, SARS. 

You, big tech, main stream media arbiters truth. free speech works. get silence people disagree with. since big tech begun editorializing content, lose right act independently. Maybe, since appreciate restriction free thought discussion, consider moving Iran China (where get Hydroxychloroquine counter btw). 

I can't believe I'm hearing people. communist country dictatorship yet behavior exactly endorsing.  midpoint income bare minimum taking care someone. Yeah people stop spending money. Even extra $600 quite bit actual pay, enough worried. gone start relying savings lot fewer purchases house find new job. case called eligibility file expired. month month renew payment.

Picked store, open door, grab food, back car, hand sanitize, off! thing before?! human interaction! oh, yeah. that's country country makes jokes feeling bad it. half expected open article read entire executive board changed pay structure hourly gave bonuses. seen news lately?

Anecdotally, I've spent way money HD Lowes year planning. I've refreshed deck, built new desk, building new patio furniture, planter boxes landscaping. Probably spent near $1,500 point. ongoing joke/conspiracy Lowe's Lowe's CEO secretly working Home Depot. least store was. may face angry mobs. actually quite disturbed CDC paper “the importance reopening schools”. tiny sample sizes using justify rather optimistic risk assessment fact “pros” return school (nutrition, safety, access technology) N/A family, can’t help feel like using sketchy science transfer someone else’s risk children. I’m quite sure ever overcome without vaccine. can’t lockdown forever. Europe prettymuch virus control. Eased restrictions it’s potentially ticking again. Won’t cycle repeat we’ll never able open again? literally takes one person, one traveller different country kick things back off.. meanwhile Sweden hasn’t exactly complete disaster first predicted.

This constant lockdown easing eventually destroy businesses, surely start looking consequences becoming worse thing itself? doctors suggested asymptomatic carriers spread disease much less- unemployment home improvement. peak crazy grandma got banned making fun Trump said “cargo” covid briefing. true people giving credit for.

I work major auto parts chain, profit margin increased almost 20% quarter 2. Sure first 3-4 weeks sales went down, however turn around massive repair industries. 

Let’s also forget corporations got massive government checks CARES act. Lowe’s giving money employees please don’t lose sight corporations means moral. PR alone move pays itself, however tax payers likely payed CARES act. PI = Principal Investigator, usually referring lead researcher given project.

They renumerated creating given survey publishing it, salaries course cover many duties. 

A simple explanation would still Koch grant funds left university research account used pay research assistant managed actual survey. ""I'll right eventually"" POTUS problem mask use enforcement varies wildly county there’s state-wide mandate. live Orange County, mask requirement, venture rarely see probably 95% people masks parking lots walking stores. Inside stores, hospitals, doctors office I’ve recently 100% people inside places. granted part Orange County, could different parts, it’s large county. mask requirement. 
 
Contrast Lake County one county over. Lake County mask requirement. bring car service dealer check engine came on. Came back pick walked building maybe 50-60% people inside masks on. maskless people salesmen service people, customers waiting service masks. workers people work pretty closely people too. 

Unless start enforcing state-wide don’t see slow time soon especially schools starting soon. cant corona youre shot death. smart! someone enjoys Umami Burger, California Pizza Kitchen good. actually blown away pizza options California. pretty solid Korean Pizza joint, basically pizza California Pizza everywhere else. 

I jealous Lemonade, locations outside California also El Torito (which used location got closed). Pizza wise? California really seem anything particular going on. Then. Now. Forever. confirm this. work install services. Typically July slowest month summer season. year it’s busiest. play devils advocate... March news reporting 5-7% fatality rate people contracted covid. Thats everything shut mass panic.

Now see real numbers closer 0.3%, majority seniors, people dont think big deal. Reduced approximately 82,000.... Ah, people supposed care neighbors. knew full shit.  let cut argument right small businesses mostly fictional impact would pre-COVID... business model requires employees work poverty wages, time go under.
 
It's small businesses would go under, they'd fire lower performing employees. 
 
How'd settle $19/hour federally? Inflation adjusted minimum wage (not metric understand, hence question) puts highest ever historical mark ~$10.50/hour. essentially doubling that. Living wage state single person $11/hour. can't see $19/hour feasible. Go Lowe’s. Avoid Home Depot..... mean, people actually believe semen demons alien DNA medicines, opinion expect them. long nobody graduates ""WhY PaY SoMeOnE eLsS's HeLtHcArE"" Stealing...*shocked picachu face* Well tell bank struggling business, they'll give million dollar PPP grant asking. gave $1200 nearly every man, woman child based good looks. seems consistent. agree direct.  People stupid, turns virus damages people's hearts, they'll demand government pay health care, plus they'll want revenge people let happen. Neither things really happen US government disintegrates.

Besides, even likely outcome states would form new federal government changes.  There's little advantage states going way they've historically part union.  

Dreams empire aside, states want cost complexity nation. good thing US government gave undisclosed half billion already rich corporations instead stimulus checks bankrupt citizens fair, always date Society regressed twice speed without real human interaction see people know france prancing around yoga, picnics, bars, hugs, vacations mask like nothing’s wrong there’s lol First hand experience

I'm sure understand first hand experience is. sample size. clinical trial. science. anecdotal evidence. Ah yeah, hope things turn around actually expect reaction comment, checked Maybe company treats employees, I'm gonna always go HD products usually superior. Especially tools.

Though say true, think big gap solely due germanys covid-strategy. Germany big export, company's closed even shutdown. orders.

Swedes also adhere common sense, meanwhile seems like Germans lose take virus serious anymore.

I still think Germanys approach right Germans, density population way higher Sweden. Swedens infrastructure also better situations like these. pay raise don’t mind asking? Here’s safely reopen bars: wait there’s plenty vaccine locally available $40 less anyone wants it. wait two weeks that, open.

I think terrible choice. kids go school bring home disease. 

They stay home, loose vital education. Early childhood education vital set kids success later life.

From Wikipedia page, generation grew Spanish Flu suffered lower socioeconomic status, lower incomes, lower rates education attainment. 

Like said horrible choice. going every day? seems high-risk right now. literally makes want cry. poor things. still circuses like day age boggles mind. Wow that’s lot masks.

Here's thing: without vaccine, disease actually allowed come back (hopefully) controlled manner.

Possibly even stage 1 needed. failure pandemic management. simply reality managing disease without vaccine  I'm sure HKU postdoc would privy PLA biodefense labs working on.

This asylum bait deranged hong konger, nothing more. Who? schools dont open another month? sounds like BS, know several studies mild asymptotic patients still shed high viral loads infect people. fact several super-spreader events asymptotic course are. Hopefully shut permanently. destroy Japan population oldest world around average 50 years old. mostly correct. florida's sprawling urban area broward/dade. tampa, orlando, jacksonville sizable populations, outside downtown areas, suburban even rural. parents living north tampa probably one rural areas. 5 counties state social distancing since 1845. that's none cared, yet even spike florida outside urban areas seen little rise death. state like wyoming, hotter flatter.

many people rural/suburban communities defied SAH order easter (april 12) ill effects. late april, SAH order longer enforced, officially ended early may. mid may, old people started coming again. daily deaths still creeping downward late june though people largely social distancing. FL one states really lockdown protests... state ended lockdown already.

HKU says work involve H2H transmission COVID-19. child I'd spoil  ever heard concept ""concentration""?

I think able understand meaning expert talking think know enough, don't. Regardless, good luck it. kid tested positive?  Amazing reporting!!!  Europe (travelling Canada) I’ll tell things become pretty lax regards masks distancing - especially Spain remember, there’s still easy win thing called Trade war. believe Buddhism, believe Christianity. reason us work together. god's good god's misused. Millennials days lazy. It’s ridiculous.

Back day put gas bag huff it, want gas literally stuck faces. Who?  Let give context:

The origin new cases (79 far, week) unknown. currently huge cluster biggest hospital Da Nang, 6000 patients currently total locked down. cluster involved really sick patients even without virus, fatality rate expected much higher normal. Da Nang already locked down, Wuhan-style, since Jul 28, 4 days first case recorded Jul 24. nearby cities going lock soon, biggest 2 (Hanoi Ho Chi Minh city) considering moment. Two veterinarians part treatment, reviewed Buddy's medical records National Geographic, told publication dog probably cancer.

So it’s actually confirmed dog lymphoma? saying based symptoms? doesn’t seem responsible option novel virus constantly showing new strange symptoms humans. notice Sweden second wave peaking around mid-June -- know caused wave? new measures introduced early June/late May combat this? Canada US would've decent leadership. initial stumbles solid course correction. (Hint: it’s not. Lol) Why? following strategy Sweden changed. 

Explain yourself. teeth, hand, big fricken liars English version? What’s going on? gives fuck dude thinks. Cases surging worldwide, even countries control like Vietnam, Japan Australia

Ugh, thought heat supposed destroy virus seems stronger ever Inb4 “yeah well face tattoos I’m successful life running Business! note, wanna buy happy coffee Herbalife?” One thing learned we've reporting deaths per capita case fatality rates. bad hear percentages thread... puts different perspective situation knowing sick enough want tested, leaning towards numbers. anyway.

We're dealing biphasic illness people usually decline later phase. also could assume number deaths months out, many reporting symptoms least long. cases would reported COVID related. know they're seeing lot small clotting around body clots form stay place. Exactly. Missing “college experience” won’t
bother nearly much unemployed, massive amount debt pay well. Nobody beats Sub-Zero. SARS MERS less transmissibility Cov2. You’d think it’d easier contain? confirmation covid likely diseases future? link? find information? thought Spain crazy lockdowns drones patrolling streets? one hand, sounds pretty insane.

On other, par Winnie Poo Asia countries like South Korea use PCR tests too. get results instantly, within 24 hours. one could predicted... seems like nice guy interviews also like one people music nothing else. Stardom makes people think intelligence one category made famous must smart. Oh yes, comment high quality, comments sub totally are... kinda operation running here?

Guys, pointed Europe worse, even say America's bad, I'm even enemy wtf. I'm posting actual research... gaslighting scum. pay :) benchmarking countries handled well? It’s simple easy win, president refuses admit he’s wrong would rather see hundred thousands die. think anyone even considered option. He'll start cooking meth pay treatment  Why? ...""The delays problems data availability beds, ventilators safety equipment could profound consequences infections deaths soar throughout country, public health experts say.

""If information accurate, could cost time — lives,"" says Lisa M.

""If ICU beds taken up, emergency medical personnel need take [new patients] next town next county.""""

According NPR, among topics discussed 9:00 hearing morning. flatten it, let burn there's mask mandate picture misleading. identifying information form patient, unless patient given express permission particular circumstance. looks like 3 4 patients given permission photos taken used article.  

Where people sick ask consent, can’t take identifying photos include things like faces tattoos distinguishing marks.

If photos needed treating case (like preparing surgery) password protected/in case file treating doctors/nurses patient access. fucking May. Science learning new things. Like new pandemic works differently known viruses (flu) used model. 50 ppl gathering restriction recommendation made *law* stop things like theatres, cinemas, concerts, demos etc. *recommendation* avoid interaction anyone outside social group/family possible.

Trust me, many parties 50 people going country...

And 50 pretty much average European countries used well.  heard Dutch health expert government sails blind (but who, course, takes cues government well) explain particles could go mask hand touch mask, eyes touch eyes, stopped listening. 

If someone dim enough believe particle would normally breathed stuck mask greater danger particle going directly lungs, take advice them. article directly refutes claim Sweden going herd immunity:

It even exact article already discussing.

These guys bots, right? inhuman wrong. Spoken like true follower !! also really easy keep worsening poop chute situation going along saying ""ho, hum, nothing do... Better fall stand what's right.""

I'm trying jab here. 

This lady single parent, widow that, talking updating go work.

There lock fatality rate is, thank you, person forty, ain't 1%. least double that, likely more. Further, life death, Christ's sake. virus dances destructive jig almost every major organ system, causing serious damage possibly profound, life long health complications. 

There point say no. more. 

It's shit position in. Maybe teacher could offer online tutoring left position, something similar. I'm sure market it, larger normal, year certain.

Because posters right. can't undo death. really liked one trailer though.. cooking seems error reporting. 32 new cases, 17 false positive. analysis, somewhere transfer fall av covid-19 region Halland uppgavs ha ökat den senaste tiden. Men när regionens labb tittade närmare på de positiva testsvaren visade det sig att över hälften av svaren inte stämde, rapporterar* [*P4 var 17 av 32 fall felaktigt positiva.

China: builds four new coal plants, doesn’t give two shits world telling shoot citizen complains party.

Pakistan: see India 

Many African Nations: underground gasoline reigning facilities literally burn tar pollutants fuel said refinements. Police military raid facilities markets sell gas dump river. corrupt don’t even call anymore, except Rewanda they’ll kill like China.

Russia: see Soviet Union chemical weapons development polluted town world. honestly think need get depth this. really need show whats going - video, photos. shown. Maybe some, all, start take seriously. first photos I've seen inside hospital since outbreak started 4 months ago. expected answer almost everybody would write top already. person family way. told I'd make sure they're buried mask suddenly changed views... made fool powerful motivator. Yes, unfair americans: USA compared developing countries like Brazil.

Europe handled much better comparison dumb. did. opened back hospitals overrun anymore. get strict rules again. Masks compulsory times public. Corornavirus comes 10pm. Smart move.

/s Yuppp exactly. Well least I’m able say honestly successfully quarantined first wave February never broken even still got virus somehow, got it(hardly) continued change actions unlike everyone know. I’ll likely keep next rise continuous wave fuckery. didn’t talk health experts job... Small sample size randomized. study started whole HCQ controversy showed results seemingly even spectacular. Let's repeat that. gets worse - HOSTED party also went melbourne go shoplifting spree luxury handbags, part gang instructed cooperate contact tracers purposefully deceitful police. Whats point testing positive result comes back patient dead? disappear family then? Wipeout whole lineage. person exist, people name.  

I can't say I'd least bit surprised says true. established study simply assuming dimensions play? imagine one actually watches press conference gets details.

Same problem trying summarise 30 minute answer question single headline. Considering news hearing longterms effects support move back stage 1 right active cases single digits 4 consecutive weeks. air quality one feet higher much worse? Makes sense.

This context taller people twice likely get infected. 70 yo beloved aunt lived NY passed covid May. pics remind went through; painful see, time stiffen resolve terms safe. concerned social distancing rules restaurants often get ignored. basically prelockdown state minus clubs, swimming pools....

There internal lockdown Europe countries poor testing expect many infections eastern Europe, Turkey, Spain common targets vacation.

Then media spins bad another Italy situation. blessings Covid... leave surgical/N95 masks alone 7 days fine. virus decay exponentially time left alone surface. Forced how? I’m honestly asking. contract expired hurt liable? refuse labor? I’m completely ignorant comes shipping industry labor force. actual fuck sending kids school september? Keep home january. shit isnt well back square one matter week. never sent many furious emails MPP arnt going stop. No. Ethics needed. Morals personal applied publicly leads inquisitions. thing objective moral. Back lockdown, nowhere world except Korea. Italy first shut Europe. Deaths confined northern Italy. South Rome saved decision. Yesterday 380 cases, 3 deaths. US 70K new cases, 1400 deaths. So, kidding. Typos. already slowly going back normal

And cases rise again, first US Europe well. Ill let little secret: America doesnt. numbers behind says ""hospitalized patients"" top ""severe condition"" bottom.

I previously read Japan hospitalize people mild conditions routine quarantining procedure, sure still case. Lol read yesterday tried get election postponed? 🤣😆 party shot ... thing cares poll numbers. Perhaps sycophant lackey suggested Fauci back might help? people grasping straws try anything possible ensure others ok individuals scientific communities well world leaders fucked yo relying narrative. didn’t research thing prove would, we’ve found many norms virus others similar aren’t norms. I’ve learned keep real solid eye opposite scientist, media, leader, average person trust think fairly smart logical. gut feeling gotten far relating virus lol. preparing worst. advice anyone next months leading winter, prepared anything. didn’t hurt enough Pretty much lot. 280 million stupid, greedy people doing? Yeah, could remember someone foaming mouth president introducing panels afterlife... Kenya, giant tower name it. Thank you! explanation kindergartens closed? Yeah, I'm UK I'm certain govt handle things, I'm *more* cautious family afford ask parents alcoholic wipes (even alcoholic preparation pads work), clean keyboard use. good practise keyboards computer mouses often filthiest things offices, best get habit clean use.

regardless risk relatively low young kids certainly would sneeze cough keyboard hands resuming use. case keyboards, always say better safe sorry. wasnt PCR test.  Non-USian here. Fauci said 'don't wear masks' fucking obvious divergence Asian European outcomes wearing mask good idea. appreciate goal might 'keep masks healthcare staff' could achieved honestly 'make mask; need protect exposed highest doses, give professional masks hospitals' rather regrets. He's fool. would anyone trust someone openly admits they'll lie public something essential, useful alternatives (make mask; best) there? could shouting rooftops: masks essential! need factory lines capable adjusting PPE production so! Set capitalism work problem. 


Also, broader US public worn mask early on, doctors needed PPE badly, would far fewer cases. 


The situation Taiwan illustrative. Everyone told stay indoors first weeks government set emergency factory lines bulk produce masks. Then, masks allocated everyone equally produced. results speak themselves. 'show tell' then? Parents love find out, own, wonderful surprise kids bringing home. funny thing wizard robe actually tries tell good person first foremost. dont give fuck. country stupid bullshit? hate Thats impossible. physically possible run PCR test 1 hour. got useless antibody test. show positive time ventilator. still generally accepted people catch asymptomatic/only mild symptoms? know that's lot people saying months ago, I'm sure science now. New cases hospitalizations Florida Texas California Arizona though, would need another lockdown?

It’s pandemic, amount leadership leads country goes it. lockdown delays inevitable going population.

When country reopens still huge susceptible population it’ll come back again. always plan, point got warped, sub doubts vaccine ever approved says take years distribute. supposed stay locked long?

Even softening language lockdowns, 20 people still think they’re relevant atleast. they’re 100% effective depending year. got year despite vaccinating. like existing world. could possibly lot worse, especially kids. Vaccine likely helped bad. live Minnesota. data seems pretty reliable. like running numbers get hospitalization rate 10-12% depending virus predominantly infects. Back March harder get test, hospitalization rate 15-18%. infected younger people number slowly going down. 
I'd also like leave footnote run numbers factor open cases. cases results.
So extrapolate mn data try predict florida at.. get florida numbers virus fuckin wildly spread crazy.. stay safe there. Time feels slow (for part me). guess means I’m old unsatisfied social interaction. Definitely agree second part. task load surely didn’t get lighter. Except fact way known virus, treatments improved, tracking tracing enhanced deaths actually wasted.

Glad he's OK! C’mon: it’s written face! That’s weird sort lockdown. see there. Sorry Vietnam, valiant brilliant effort keep country free COVID-19 deaths. end virus would always won. amazing long Vietnam kept virus bay. I've seen 2 Shipt workers wearing masks grocery stores. complained company gave dates, times, locations descriptions employees. seemed take seriously reminded state mask mandate. wanted take seriously look situation. blows mind people delivering groceries, potentially vulnerable person, they're wearing masks. Individuals capable spreading virus even asymptomatic presymptomatic. *you’re goddamn right* Tf getting math lol Every country 3 good meals away civil unrest. logistics failed, stores would run food 3 days, 4 days people would streets rioting stealing anything edible. confirm, Home Depot parking lot always full. friends kid works asked get TP, took almost week. said can't keep shelfs stocked long enough. That’s cynical view. revolve violence, talking anomalies. really, many countries worse death rates. Annnnd US federal system, meaning governor responsible president. president Trump didnt send old people coronavirus old people homes...... Michigan New York governors.... New York 32,362 deaths.... 6,586 dead Florida..... btw populous hundred thousand..... michigan 10mil citizens, yet number dead Florida, 20 million citizens. 

In Fact, lets look deaths per 100,000, better indicator state total deaths, state 1/20th population Cali instance.... goes:

New York

New Jersey 

connecticut

Massachusetts 

Rhodes island 

DC

then, get Louisiana, first 5 democrat, 6 republican, 7, 8, 9, 10 11 12 also democrat.... hmmm one top 1o republican, guess democrats statisitically handling thing worse.

Texas California EXACTLY same, yet California never went lockdown, except peaceful riots, Texas opened 10 weeks uptick, funny, isnt call comeback. Well higher end Gyms open people smart enough wear masks,keep feet away always sanitize hands drinking water touching gym equipment. case country least. Plus, 24 hour ventilation clean day surely required. Also, allow certain number people inside. really easy think lot people scared go gym atm due covid managable. Yes business shuts down, takes years open back up. govt would give loan, they'd plan use rehire people, could take weeks. 

Keep everything open, let people die hundreds thousands time someone dies get free hospital bed. - governors Florida, Texas, Georgia, Arizona etc ... shocked constantly shedding virus even totally asymptomatic. cluster pops traced small-town high school someone's parents teacher coach die whoever local gossip network decides primary vector probably move out.

Took minute.

Look again. Well surpassed lot we've discussed previously, correct say Sweden compared developing countries.

You probably right. compare Sweden countries like Denmark now, due unwisely lifting restrictons early, seeing another wave cases people dubbed ""controlled burn"". 

Sweden spare testing capacity would probably willing help Denmark implement successful TTI strategy managed bring numbers Sweden. always Denmarks friend, need ask. I'd say zero new deaths today pretty good payoff absolutely believe user. area lumber doubled, materials *projects*, *backyard gardening*, *hobby work* doubled more. According employees they're receiving trucks anyone's ever seen, shelves stay bare. Another carpenter know still working drive many 5 different store locations find $500 material jobs. surprising all. Good Toronto! Personally idea vote two, neither really came across good choice me. option home school? 

I went college 15 years ago home school....is alabama really far behind? ever applied Medicaid? “but you’re smart it, won’t go uninsured outrageous medical bills.”
Several years ago teaching private school husband working (attorney). first year work started saving money aggressively, even moved family. pregnant things going really well. plan use maternity leave last month school, recover summer break, return teaching fall. actually happened; school didn’t renew contract husband’s company wasn’t offering health insurance paid COBRA coverage $650 per month. 4 months later discovered someone company embezzling thousands dollars husband work. $4,000 savings two us work. denied unemployment, husband started working himself. 
We applied Medicaid denied $4,000 savings account. legally spend $1,000 order qualify. 
It nightmare. tried prepaying lease office, prepay bills, without steady source income scary almost money. Anyway, whole process took 2 months approved right went hospital approved mistake. spend money eventually get Medicaid rely financial help family several months used meager savings order get health insurance.
You absolutely broke California order get Medicaid, even then, good luck finding doctor see you. lucky $4,000. you’re responsible adult you’re 50s saving retirement, good luck. reply 70 days later people already died. need get infected will. Takes time. 1 3 here. different covidsperience friends without kids lol. rest paycheck also taxed. put notice work stay home kids participate distance learning. way hell putting kids situation. can't even believe thing. kind sense make?

Tinfoil hat theory: (Florida, one, live...) want kids go back school parents go back work. want try stimulate economy...or something. Hell, know lol, effin' ridiculous! That's point. CNN little late party.

Drug trials, general, notoriously racist. always been.

This well documented many proposals aimed address issues. problem really want address issues. Lowe’s Home Depot WFH good idea right regardless else happening, yes extra wise confirmed cases work. good. well denying entrance / removing anyone without mask. wear mask, fuck you. pay raise $2 hour bonus line item paycheck. 1 month. think world whole lost battle, late win war True, true. Early bad problem pan-west. tbh Germany went degree required masking fairly early on. Czech Republic actually led issue Europe IIRC. *most* Europe mask requirements recommendations less Nordics (and Netherlands think). 

Denmark making progress towards recommending masks rest, taking baby steps. Sweden almost every time presser double anti-masking stance. really mindblowing. That's got last time they're again. Even pre-COVID, visited friend Roanoke VA (I'm CO) amazing convenience store/gas station combo called Sheetz. Even five years prior impressed little human interaction necessary get meal. Pushed buttons, charged card, bag tossed towards surly fashion teenager got scurry away like rat without interact small talk. Yesss Yea totally need military enforce lockdown actually weld people shut homes like China did! totally line democratic values! /s

Fuck sub fearmongering dumbasses. beyond mind-blowing comment upvoted much. Seriously, deserve complete Orwellian gov. desperately crave. today zero new deaths reported? Uhh whole country passed annual flu season deaths April.... I'm not. body choice, IDC person harm me. Banning things makes black market creates crime. Plus would effective ban pot, tobacco super easy grow stuff grow home knock feet. go almost every day.

Why go Lowe's everyday? Well chinese government nothing hide, lying citizen benefit DNC committee voted putting Medicare platform. fucking hate politicians. previously offered monetary raise per hour (2 bucks, HOT DAMN) essential workers, (surprise surprise!) quickly realized presented worthwhile incentive work many hrs possible...they will. bonus token effort. MEANWHILE, phone blowing every day either asking volunteers work days informing another COVID confirmed case site. 

Don’t smoke, it’s hard hell face mask. yet value ""freedom"" way much still decline wear dam mask....

cuz 'Murica. Majority players opting worried themselves, families. I'm sure worried directly health, especially pre-existing issues. gigantic cocksucker. CDC *is* government! government already tracking data own!

I know know - it’s bonkers. blatant. fucking guys... Awww, that's nice. Maybe compensate announcing enforce mask usage stores. number *known* new cases expected fall.

The number actual cases likely rise people forced close quarters amongst anti-maskers. Well zero deaths today maybe boss point assume he's roughly multiplying .6% IFR estimated CDC 20% threshhold spread within non-incredibly-dense population seems grind halt. I'm OP speculating could get number. trolls turning discussion thread regulars paranoid maniacs. bastards spend day posting kinds stupid confrontational bullshit trying get us distrust other, every day barrage us stupid bullshit questions make us distrust genuine ones. guy brought Bill Gates last night wanting talk pandemic prevention. downvoted trolls conditioned us immediately assuming leading conspiracy theory. goal completely shut normal conversation they're winning. needs done this. Probably contributor crisis point well, thinking vaccine right around corner YOLO ""is hoax?""

Fauci's expression towards questions gold. Also, must go home wondering bother... Lmao work Lowes. done since start pandemic. Increased hourly workers pay, every month giving hourly employees bonuses also

Have influx people applying work Lowe's? number new “reported” cases drop days. People won’t getting tested test sites closed. Facebook feed filled people who've already moved anti-mask posts railing future vaccines well, saying absolutely never take one let kids get one.

The way America ending giant meteor. hurricane cure. need artificially create hurricane across world. got nothing us Rona! Likely, folks downvoting kids. way would work police every corner, stopping cars questioning people going, going house house, checking parties going on, 

Yes start suggesting type thing, social science behavioral science start coming play. ask question failing lack leadership, failing lack personal responsibility, dangerous combination two? would suggest latter....

Someone lot expertise would needed answer question - Americans given legal order President (whoever time) current administration (i.e. stay home, gatherings illegal notice) - whether would ADHERE order. believe society general would comply? believe society general would rebel ignore advice? would way police it, except run police ragged responding every single neighbor grasses neighbors gatherings.....and would exclusion actual duties preventing crime violence upholding law.

Maybe side effects hydroxy chloroquine “The evidence suggests children less likely become infected, less likely develop severe disease less likely transmit virus children adults,” said co-author pediatrician Dr. William Raszka Jr. University Vermont School Medicine.


the former commissioner Food Drug Administration Scott Gottlieb, wrote Thursday ""data clearly shows [children are] less likely become infected less likely transmit infection."" Ok, bonuses taxed? 

They are, went full telling associates getting $500 cash bonus. 

As far away stock tax 30%, Someone know one vest peak $3300 weeks ago got like $2300. areas go overall, areas well states already higher pay $13-$14, went losing VCP, especially peak becomes 16% bonus.

Point seasonals fair. 

IMO, one reasons get shit much consistently look associates. course, system great big big coincidence.

Nope. work major supplier caulks sealants, great quarter despite economy. There's definitely boom sales diy projects. 2.3 billion less penny compared contraction US economy.

They've lines door ever since moment people told safe go retail stores. buddy decade said they're regularly Black Friday numbers weekdays now.

It's like Americans told virus would come free blowjob. Also, 

1) adults spread disease without coughing sneezing, 

2) kids spread viruses, many harder spread, even though coughs sneezes shallow. worries :)  Historical measures?

If doctor, something like ""myocardial inflammation"" would sound lot less scary you. think germs would get sure, I'm kinda torn wether would lot little. 

I'm familiar person Guess we'll see widespread immunity Sweden fall/winter arrives. manage stave second wave, rest Europe forced go back lockdown it, might prove success. *If* course vaccine/treatment then. source I’d love see it. know that's bullshit. Come on. serious!? That's acceptable way. risking childs life go school deserve visit CPS need visit inside jail cell. “This figure [more than] twice high previous antibody tests, meaning public immunity COVID-19 probably much higher antibody studies suggested,"" Ding told MedPage Today. ""This course good news public health perspective, shows people negative antibody test results could still immune virus cellular level."" Again, do, equate everyone. True, there’s something viral load needs quantified included. mere presence virus suspended microdroplet isn’t enough trigger conclusions infectious conditions based timelines air samples. could clear weeks.

MRIs hearts found 78% exhibited visual signs virus impacted organ; 60% showed evidence inflammation.

Things like myocardial infection lasting weeks months really strange many kinds bad viral infection. would typically happen epidemic (or pandemic) contained virus eventually becomes what’s called endemic, meaning similar numbers cases every year much fewer initially were. Take 2009 H1N1 flu, circulates seasonal flu strains. 

If covid immunity turned lifelong people would look like measles, mostly infected young people yet it.

Endemic covid certainly wouldn’t good thing, especially immunity isn’t lifelong, would seriously strain healthcare systems, real chance we’ll develop vaccine relatively soon.  Yep. That’s posted it. endo personal experience too.  believe read somewhere ~~100~~ 190/340 ICU beds (e: i’m seeing different numbers quick google search im braindead rn low number). also believe highest % multi-generation families living roof doesnt help.

i know inevitable hawaii would get covid makes blood boil seeing asshat tourists coming + breaking mandatory 14 day quarantine bc “cheap flight tickets” “if pandemic/catch virus i’d want hawaii” Honestly, whole country shut **simultaneously** months. Essential activities only. Fines scaled 1-10% person's assets and/or potential jail time. Use fine money hero pay essential workers. Watch COVID ""magically"" disappears. 


Half-hearted lockdowns shift people ""unlocked"" areas. Can't go restaurant LA County? Fine, I'll go OC. think people agree decide accept risk sooner later. can. write story almost cherish much would cherished failed marriage? countries say masks? Everyone free wear one afaik. 

Also think important distinguish reasons say generally masks *that know of* simply studies matter.

It's quite possible individual level face masks prevent asymptomatic spread degree, population level face masks leads feeling security, mobility less social distancing, net loss attempt prevent spread.  sex demons must gotten her.

I've living apartment since 2013. first year raise rent us.  Now, fair, rent gone $975/mo $1019/mo six years, outrageous increases. fellow tenants asked lowering rent year, many us seen either reduced hours complete layoffs. 

""Be glad raise rent."" told. multiple elevator outages many us mobility issues (myself included). running water several days want pay something fixed holiday weekend. (And ""fix"" getting water buffalo full filthy foamy water. Oh, want drinking water? Here's one 12oz bottle per tenant entire duration issue.)

We're supposed happy raise rent.

I don’t think there’s specific study germs spread wind instruments, it’s safe assume germs would get through, although perhaps much reduced amount. big threat would course part instrument place near mouth blow through.

Also seem familiar can’t remember why. Oklahoma triple Hopefully... shouldn’t happen. wouldn’t surprised happen Ugghh, hope got tipped really well. Yeah that's say mechanism action. zinc well studied effective antiviral. think thats realistic? Haha However, since excluded patients seriously ill, ***asymptomatic patients***, patients whose symptoms present week, whose symptoms latest available data indicates that, children infected COVID-19 likely asymptomatic... ,

The study pertain majority young children.

Some people suggest young children might less infectious adults, they're often asymptomatic. 

All study show minority young children, symptomatic, likely infectious adults, that's kinda expected. 

This helpful, question need answered. want know young children average, minority young children, infectious. 

That said, evidence assume infectious. anything can't close state borders can't. yeah anything  They're mandatory already? wtf Yeah.

not true x2 absolutely right. sub promotes schools close though, ought get voted piece truth. Madness ruled $$$$

Totally nonessential Hawaii done pretty good job though thus far. Also hawaii population 1.416 Million math below:

Florida population: 21.480 Million
Daily infections 30/07/20: 9,956
Percentage Pop newly infected: 0.0464%

Hawaii population: 1.416 Million
Daily infections 30/07/20: 126
Percentage Pop newly infected: 0.00889%

Florida population 15.17 times larger Hawaii. 126 cases Hawaii theoretically equivalent 1,911 new cases Florida. 

So even 1,911 cases sounds bad compared 9,956 right? ever thought of. Especially island state number hospitals available much lower (presumably) would much harder get patients different state needed. ALSO florida huge spike time, Hawaii continues increase daily infections possible seriously scary numbers quickly like hot spots.

To throw current situation, live county 11,000 people Oklahoma. beginning june 0 active cases. July 24th total 22 cases. July 30th hit 52 cases. 6 days, double amount cases 0-30 active cases. getting control quickly even rural America now.

I pictured Viola Davis apparating handing vaccines probably administer yourself. order one online watch video. I'm considering flu coronavirus vaccine.

Don't feel stupid. interact anyone outside household administering vaccine simple think is, not? looking here? long teachers students intimate contact, continue operate normal. ex-patients died bullets heads. covid-19 case, one died it. celebrities, many Americans would lost. Well, ain’t yet faith. work home, don’t use public transport, grocery shopping week. keep distance. 

The strategy chosen places lot responsibility citizens. citizens listen act accordingly. 😭😭 Don’t worry, Jared Kushner’s college roommate case. I’m sure it’ll fine. love ass mouth conspiracy theories Knowing Texans they'll blame deaths Californians moving Texas. Texas weird relationship California. open schools. rest world turning results around &lt; 24 hours. Yes. symptoms one person necessarily impact another person experiences it. asymptomatic carrier could infect someone needs double lung transplant. That's definitely true. lot excess death US. numbers definitely undercounted. confirmed ones. Today Trump said wants delay election *and* wants send military Portland enforce order.

First Cancer, Covid, goddamn No, Ol' Billy Bitchtits. long healthy dose skepticism knew evaluate information fact check, could hang joe rogan sub distill crap potential signal. Build wall!  yo mean? think hard science correct. Massive social dristancing saves lives. 

But what's left social science. massive social distancing sustainable? Humans social animals long term isolation issues. problem eventually deal fatigue non-compliance population.

For whatever reason focused former didnt even consider latter. 

Fatigue hard lockdowns set people went crazy soon restrictions slightly lifted. virus resurged true US (which particularly bad example) seem similar things rest world. Asia, Oceana, Americas (Canada too). 

Sweden seeing virus resurgance, place geographically isolated areas like New Zealand. 

The main difference Sweden approach factored social science went moderate social distancing restriction. Sufficent slow spread excessive people suffer fatigue. Hard measures preserved absolutely necessary. 

This approach might sustainable long term. 
That key, mass disseminated vaccine come soon, Sweden death rate might much lower rest world, moderate social distancing approach resulted less fatigue greater long term compliance. yall callin yokel. Close borders. new measures taken? get vaccine we’ll fine. then, there’s nothing do. America, monkey’s bottle. Pandora doesn’t go back box, comes out. Online pickup door car only. one first things did. Absolutely nobody except workers allowed stores several months.

Take restaursunts example. Many installed bank slot pickup takeout food. Little interaction public. Oh dear god, wtf wrong state 😑 insert IG pic huddled together—without masks—for group photo

This inherently bad. small group people socialize without distancing masks without significantly increasing risk equally careful sharing indoor air anyone outside group. Bubbles like emerging everywhere hardwired need socialize unable satisfy using internet.

Also strictly speaking, never use “rubber stamp”(such Shachihata) legal documents. inkan accepted. yeah, it’s still stupid culture imo. Idk original comment got numbers here’s stab mobile...

0.5% IFR (middle-range estimate, without considering Florida’s older skewed age)

about 60% total people need infected begin seeing immunity (estimate based old article found April, reputable articles I’ve read estimate 40%-80%)

Florida’s population 2015 20,271,273 according Wikipedia.

So rough calculatuon would 20,271,272 x 0.6 = 12,162,763.2 total infections needed herd immunity

12,162,763 x .005 = 60,813 deaths expected infection fatality rate (all known/unknown cases) 0.5%

John’s Hopkins says Florida 6,586 deaths right now, so:

6,586 (current deaths) / 60,813 (“potential deaths”) = 10.83% total “possible” deaths.

Like original comment said, doesn’t consider hospital overload potential influences like vaccinations/improved treatment/etc. RIP nobody survives this. thread getting good till someone said median age Africa 20s:

Are sources saying COVID causes chronic thickened blood? Honestly curious, trying call out. Although even did, know fairly easy get prescription blood thinners. 

Problems line could happen, I'm denying aim downplay virus. 

Despite that, I'm optimistic. feel though majority people notable long-term impact COVID. (This reference mild cases. I've also heard recent signs COVID may cause long-term heart damage, could go detail bad sounds *in cases* well, interested.) 

I fault anybody takes good news grain salt concerned bad news, though. logical think way. cautious rarely bad thing.

Edit: mean much, although I'm currently student nurse I'm used reading kind studies worrying people right around now. 

The reason speak (Note: real life people ignoring COVID. Strictly people seem bit panicked) many articles misinterpreted. common misinterpretation ""long term damage"" read ""long term effects"", two same.

If (as do) stay home possible, wear mask outside,... yes, give names people might exposed. Namely husband three people.


But would go life usually (no mask, going out), I’d screwed. clue close contact last days. would able infect people three stores, neighbors, workers greenery front house, ...... think people can’t work home use public transport every day.


As always wear mask outside limits dangerous contacts tremendously. seems like complete distraction point made though? top asshat saying it’s joke, stops lockdown becomes vacation people. Lockdown means don’t see people. going work doesn’t mean shit go hang instead. understand concerns, brought up, it’s still dangerous message say masks fix regardless. need precise messaging else people risk disproportionately risk. example, elderly neighbor puts little mask goes legitimately thinks blocks it. going door door getting people sign petition, still shopping stores daily he’s bored, etc. impression he’s 100% safe it, mask has, definitely isn’t. It’s people like don’t want mislead. mask issue pretty nuanced reality! Tokyo done cloth paper masks aerosolized Okay, think I’m going instead. Thanks help. long take go through? yeah fuck trump abbot. since technically covid scare I’ll still get benefits? I’d probably earn unemployment anyways.. don’t want put family risk this.

Likelihood infection = low. 4 days LA opened free testing everyone. got faster that, slower recent LA spike. stories sad hear. people stop virus succumbing people about...that's tough ingest honestly. 

I really admire healthcare workers. Tokyo tested 4795 people Oklahoma 17397 tests. Lmfao. Uh huh.  onion goggles? agree let’s forget entire state California people whole country Canada. 39.50 million california 37.5 whole country Canada. equal comparison vs Canada. Though American area California well. many areas /states idiots asking like nothing’s wrong. lottery - like movie contagion. selected, accept decline, can't sell give spot away. Provide basis claims. Yes Texas circus live, gyms open bars closed back  “The best available evidence countries opened schools indicates COVID-19 poses low risks school-aged children, least areas low community transmission, suggests children unlikely major drivers spread virus.”

I think crucial bit “at least areas low community transmission”. don’t problem areas cases opening schools. areas, self-quarantining contact-tracing effectively implemented. areas large numbers cases, though, think opening schools complete disaster. pretty big chunk America doesn’t currently fit “low community transmission” category.

Also go safelinkwireless.com apply free (crappy) phone minutes data month SIM card minutes data put old phone. hope helps. ""no"" masks, focus distance. worrying trends people think fine visit grandma long mask. like train company did, opened booking seats, instead 50% ""started offering masks"".

It's used way ignore social distancing, even companies. people forced wear masks cheat, removing purpose possible making worse.

So far distancing mask needed... turn face away people, keep mouth closed face walls extra safety. people WEAR masks given double distance respect fear signaled vulnerability.

But I've gotten masks keep I'd end crowd though. someone coughing. American defending USA: patriotic!

Chinese defending China: propaganda! Brainwashed! fact 'Be creative beating virus, circumventing rules' trending quote among politicians really shows virus problem society.

Also might want share English article next time. far back going say ""Worst ever?"" goes back 30s... mean, one person getting sick wearing mask really great evidence.

Also believe declining numbers one bit. Without mitigation efforts, really think Florida's numbers gonna magically come down? lot cases sure, even real number ten times that, there's still ways go herd immunity. Optics based virtue signaling “vice” businesses scientific empirical basis... 
Just like requirements many states closing bars leaving restaurants open, know can’t anything spread, need “appear” something it.

Reason being: articles highlighting state affairs Sweden last 1-2 weeks vs state affairs across rest Europe looking new confirmed cases. yet seen single article directly compared ICU admission numbers multiple countries come conclusions Sweden faired vs countries.

I speak UK ICU occupancy consistently dropping despite stagnation (and recent increase) new cases across country.

The point making still stands, nothing gained comparing country country B one specific time chance outbreaks synchronised low variance testing volume makes numbers incomparable.

Nah july trend directly continues may. case ""backlog"" june direct consequence increased obviously summer lockdown thing. Denmark would seeing uptick much culture. simply wrong. Sweden one highest death tolls world, one pount thousands cases per day, much much higher death toll Denmark does. Sweden's actions say ""controlled burn herd immunity"". One preliminary blip Danish supression / TTI strategy mean going emulate Sweden. feel social distancing coupled mask-wearing (plus basic hygiene like washing hands) day 1 would netted way better results lockdowns.

Sweden lockdown citizens smart enough social distance (not sure masks tho, seen plenty photos maskless Swedes) managed fewer deaths per million hard lockdown countries like Belgium, Italy Peru.

Why new cases COVID-19 prognosis severe risk death high?

(Friday, 07/31/2020 14:27)

Patients COVID-19 elderly group, chronic disease, obesity exhaustion, easy get worse, risk death.

Information Treatment Subcommittee said currently number patients COVID-19 severe development.

According Assoc.Prof. Dr. Luong Ngoc Khue - Director Administration Medical Examination Treatment, Deputy Head Treatment Sub-Committee, many patients COVID-19 period severe, aggravated, especially critical. fast.

As morning July 31st, among COVID-19 patients treated, following patients severe progression, severe prognosis, high risk death: BN416, BN418, BN431, BN436, BN437, BN438 ... 

In addition, patients progressed worse BN429, BN426, BN427, BN430, BN422, BN433 ... majority severe patients problem elderly, many underlying diseases.


Information press end morning July 31, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son, Deputy Minister Health said, infected COVID-19, group people high risk aggravation focus group people. elderly (over 60 years old), underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney failure, dialysis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary ...) atopic, obese, impaired masterpiece ...

""These factors easily lead risk aggravation infected COVID-19"" - Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

Analyzing specifically mechanism aggravation, Deputy Minister Health Nguyen Truong Son said group mentioned COVID-19 reduce resistance, making virus grow body faster, Organ damage faster patients.

""I aware risk cytokine storm. people attacked virus activate body's immune system. system attacks virus also attacks internal organs, causing impairment."" organs reduced functions, leading severe disease, 91 patients Ho Chi Minh City previous period ""- Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

During period, Subcommittee Treatment clearly record number patients experiencing ""cytokine storm"", however, according Deputy Minister Health, number patients showed signs, although changes signs organ failure well life threatening.

During period, COVID-19 patients chronic disease use respiratory support ECMO, mechanical ventilation, oxygen ...


""This dangerous sign, patients general patients chronic renal failure particular suffer disease, also accompanied serious diseases diabetes, heart failure, increased blood pressure ... virus attacks, organs vulnerable, resistance decreases much ""- Deputy Minister Nguyen Truong Son said.

An expert geriatrics said resistance elderly, suffering underlying diseases often lower age groups. If elderly ill, COVID-19 cause chronic diseases progress acute exacerbation, patients likely die.

In fact, countries large number people infected dying, proportion COVID-19 patients die mainly elderly people many chronic diseases.


  Arguing open, masks masks, distancing, hygiene etc, waste time. Regardless done, they'll open shut right back again. question many get sick die interim.  **fact** yet, decision allow cash payments busses could reversed. There's LOT buzz Danish media right needing NPIs, quite possible one might changed. one reference decided on. 

The jump concerning need panic. Sweden's conditions still far worse, much worse recently. 

Yeah, decision open Sweden definitely part bone thrown right pro business faction agree terrible. bad Sweden put much pressure Danish government too, since also part it. Crying ""unfair discrimination"" border closing basically behaving quite immaturely instead respectfully. pressure pretty awful imo, bad Danes caved it. making way east coast Meanwhile pay got cut 15%.... saying this? I'm NY heard all. can't catch Sweden getting cases per capita yours. less 20 people ICU nationally still going require face masks busy parts biggest cities, slight uptick cases. Yeah, pretty sure guy graduated top class Cornell Medical School infectious diseases doctor 40 years probably read basic bio textbook... proof? proof Sweden didn’t stop TTI less hit regions Stockholm Gothenburg. go first maybe prove kept TTI Bergamo example? doesn’t make sense. Huge chunk customers middle class/upper middle class liberals. Midwest Republicans don’t drive Teslas coastal rich Republicans definitely don’t drive Tesla’s. Business wise, allegiance stupid rush vaccines going wild. One another. interesting see plays out. canada CERB, essentially job affected COVID eligible 2000$ month 24 weeks. really think vaccine would scrapped ""works great"" billion people? case medications diseases. using following. paragraph:

Mortality Rate (23k / 8.4M = 0.28% CMR date) Probability Dying

As May 1, 23,430 people estimated died total population 8,398,748 New York City. corresponds 0.28% crude mortality rate date, 279 deaths per 100,000 population, 1 death every 358 people. Note Crude Mortality Rate continue increase infections deaths occur (see notes paragraph ""Herd Immunity"" details). lot SEC states told order new shutdown/stay-at-home order cases go down. 
SEC states - ""NAH"" ""Hot mess"": perfect phrase sum last four years! I'm gonna refer 2015-2020 (maybe even little bit later) ""Hot Mess American Era."" ;) learned NWSL. isn’t like aids all. think small thing regards everyone's safety outside app work better people use it. Plus battery drainage bluetooth devices connected minimal. I'm teacher's group state pretty much called soon parents started yelling open schools up. parents get schools open, next battle ban masks campus. Schools chessboard certain people play petty partisan battles, largely schools/teachers/districts conditioned fight back fear seen ""political"".

We large constituency country batshit crazy wants inflict everyone around them. country given years years years ""easy"" thing do, reaping results so. store restaurant chain actually enforcing mask order gets confronted, low-wage workers getting injured killed people audacity ask wear tiny piece fabric minutes. What? Bulldogs? Yeah SEC moneyyyyy. Yeah they’re gonna ignore even though hundreds UGA tested positive even though fall semester hasn’t started. Well else expect beezos buy homes neighborhood? greedy. Yup, lot going on. way viruses spread mystery. one moves airway airway, that's it, simple. Probably help believed ""Masks ineffective"" month died. yeah thats problem individual people top big news organisations.. essentially way much power regard controlling narratives

but way always throughout history, even back roman empire rich influential men controlling narrative plebs got.. thats changed tech use Also wife still working, transferred insurance. getting number 8k from?

This shows decline 700 since today 8,246 hospitalizations. yet mutate enough immune difference. proved point?? 

Other weekends, days people don’t work anyways, workforce mobility hasn’t changed meaningful way I'm since DIY home improvement safe, socially distanced activity assuming wear mask store supply runs. wore goggles went doctor dermatomogist knew I'd people within inches face. said good idea. think I'd much point, 4 months ago... Oh man, fresh taco’s..

Now I’m drooling.. Ignoring fact Denmark's cases recently doubled seen largest number cases per day since May 18th, yet Danish government removing measures - things unheard Sweden right unlike Denmark, they're controlled burn. Kobalt Lowe's house brand, compare HD's Husky brand.

Lowe's carries Dewalt Bosch, similar maybe even favorable compared Milwaukee/Makita. Lowe's restructuring eliminate high paying hourly positions inviting employees reapply severe reduction pay? mean, hazard pay nice, seems they're capitalizing situation reduce pay guise stopping hazard pay over. know Europe soccer makes work MLB barely required touching.

Can't wait football season. great country Samsung wearable, links phone via Bluetooth. BT always on. problem?

Also phone automatically hooks in-car hands-free via Bluetooth whenever get car. also bad? I'm sure I'm person planet using Bluetooth way. missing? Ya that’s risk too. It’s 100% either way. feel like people would go bar watch sports right probably go bar even isn’t sports tv. No, didn't. Love nickname! seems appropriate. Wow 😱 getting numbers from? 60k/3m comes 2% exposed asymptomatic wait week? without reason personally me. im guy answers still looking me? literally answers informed people everywhere now.

but see youre going endlessly start new tangents whether answer things dont really want spend friday yeah bye. brilliant workaround. almost like manchurian candidate put power exactly intended. **literally** think simulation

At 12:23 world simulation find way cheat make everything better? 

**Elon:** simulation, indistinguishable reality. strive make future people look forward to. Expand scope consciousness, explore universe, try understand better, figure right questions ask... People say sick sent nursing homes that’s bad. Yeah, love this. 

If could turn trend would sure help USPS. Seriously! knows germs people give weak immune system? Closer 3/4 weeks anyone ever think could keep virus suppressed via contact tracing without first suppressing it? Anyone see Fauci wink end 🥺 equivalent 507 deaths Texas. Yikes 😬. Wow, thanks that. guess get stuffed then.

I would strongly prefer media outlets non-biased honest, guess that's much ask day age appear owned select few. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* dont seem understand use commas correctly.

4% many, 4% americans socially distanced one would claim lot americans socially distancing. someone tell kids going school July please?   reverse spikes see weekends... people don’t go work weekends... Propaganda hell thing.... (for most) dedicated entire life point. 

you're talking guy who's 25 years career would love hang travel world hiking I'm still fit, I'm financially ready retirement yet. I'd close, except divorce. 

how spend money playing (expensive lifestyle) great excuse. I'd debt overspending lifestyle. 

start restaurant, get sales, lots jobs generic college degrees. 

i begrudge money, comes rarity physique skills popularity sport, need retire. someone needs explain WNBA salaries NFL Europe salaries low. Probably, philosophically meaningless. Death always unavoidable long run.

But carry on, think unavoidable deaths much apt description Swedish situation.

Eta: edited comment sadly mine makes less sense now. there’s evidence they’re beginning anything resembling outbreak compared countries. HD getting minimum wage at?! Starting well around me, although $15 vogue politics. I'd prefer back obviously, hardly fair tout Lowe's program deny HD's entirely like 90% thread doing. trying say here? Nothing I've said counts ""fake news."" Fake news completely fabricated content aims mislead. 

The numbers right anybody see, drawn reputable sources. I'm saying certainty something done data. I'm noting recent data look highly suspicious, merits closer investigation critical questioning people responsible data. Especially current circumstances. mean yes, difference he's moron put post-Microsoft life investing stuff understanding it.

Now different argument billionaire donors role sort work set societal priorities, rather governments. dogs Ah yes. always baseball screwing up. least sports learn mess up.  Edit made, thanks mate! They're going wait January decide. cousin moved Sweden almost 20 years ago... never worry money much due leaving job... lose sleep kids need medical treatment, big small.  even gave birth two nephews, got paid maternity 12 months each.(ok, 90% pay)

me, hand, still worry health insurance even working company provided almost best health plan country(well, good Congress provides elected officials technically ""servants"") don’t think so. Io look little suspicious... Credit u/emersonthird

#vaccine volunteers needed - sign here:
The NIH/CDC conducting phase 3 vaccine trial Fauci testified need volunteers. Sign here: NIH here: rona? Donate blood donate blood plasma. antibodies used research etc. might get $1000 hazard paycheck September state government. better nothing certainly doesn’t seem like enough. 

My hours went up, pay stayed since I’m salary. March April worked 4 weeks straight. Every day, 24 hour shifts. increase pay. Good news depending tax situation.. could well get bonus money back via tax return. usually owe probably not. Lot's people talk earth flat idiots. lollllll

it doesn’t hurt set bar high Jim Jordan? mean guy ignored sexual abuse allegations wrestling coach, whose purpose hearings grandstand Trump? That's one, right? running rampant January 20th 2021 properly mitigated effective administration. Whats happening sounds like happening mom, sick C19 4 weeks update gave yesterday was: Doctor's office called back morning said xray reads
""Thickening center lung"" And, don’t know stupid wrong thing send kids school safety measures place, especially low infection numbers. Online learning work lot kids, even resources so. downsides long term effects school would far outweigh risk virus. thats (or be), whats best children, personal belief politics. reason kids areas currently middle huge surge can't return school. least putting millions lives danger spewing bullshit Ok good. legit scared bro, sounds like he’s top technically worked often not. federal government always uses federal agents mercs armed forces contain rebellions.

But outnumber literally back down, gained progress. ever need care credit denied. ya go, zero death hospital confirmed State still announcing deaths today...from Deaths attributed last 24 hrs could backfilled later.  Looks like I'm switching Lowes anyone know poster behind Scalise about? able catch fully. actual science also pretty heavily refuting idea antibodies fall way people think do. recent study instance shows stable titers six months. study everyone references antibodies fell 90 days (which expected) everyone sort extrapolated mean zero antibodies exist shortly that.

That true mildest infections. COVID survivors measurable antibody levels least far six months out. Maybe homeowners? One ""supposed"" homeowner one starts family, all. payments (and mortgage payments) wipe unbelievable amounts capital HCL locales. *had* saved, system punished for...

Get victim blaming, dude. family probably tried responsible possible. America fucked them. We're period history people defend government - while, people realizing now. Obviously, going forward, $4000 savings recognized close enough. realize utterly going betrayed. Now... horrible, horrible lesson learned. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Fuck home depot homies hate home depot  cancel season. SEC doesn’t need want them. People sit bar social interaction. grown adult drink alone home patio table. It’s unfortunate. Shock: person deludes everything life believes delusions. 3 years? Considering we're 47 years (in 2020 time) since March, that's actually terrible. 2 3 keep eating restaurants going around unmasked people stupid? country lot highly educated people it, also country major cable news networks dedicated conspiracy theories telling people wear masks, social media sites flooded bad actors - plus political leaders also same. 

The elites every country right general consensus massive pandemic bad fought adequate safety measures. one group argue death. I'm relatively centrist UK terms, voted three main parties one time another. *You* bigot zero empathy therefore incapable seeing anything different point view.

You appear American btw, need understand Boris likely left Obama. double-checked result.

This Walgreens Hillsboro, Oregon. appointment 2 pm, actual test took place maybe 2:10, emailed result timestamped 2:37 pm., roughly agrees memory.

Interestingly, test result document shows ""collected"" time 14:56, ""reported"" time 14:37. idea terms truly mean, know took test got result.

As type test, again, know. nasal swab, brain-tickler. Sure, frankly take one step hire risk countries like Sweden, developed country Europe WHO's list risk countries. 

But root problem lies high infection burden Sweden. high risk infection burden Sweden = less risk hiring Swedish workers clearly. wish app USA download.  Yeah I’m trusting vaccine made China.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Article talks *""a group physicians dared state **belief**""* goes mention ""Dr"" Stella Immanuel. kill some, enslave some, ignore some. Thats script since Rome. Yes, explained downthread. scenarios financially beneficial, that's all. Good luck anyone trying navigate stuff medical emergency though. Totally nonessential 

Shut pens ballots. True. skim lot articles, read some. gotten info health workers couple states. make decisions based available info, still new. hear dude, hate system politicians. system needs change, result changed priorities politicians. swap current politicians keeping system gonna wind corrupted politicians again. Instead Surgeon General CDC recommended wearing masks, American supply chain PPE would able mobilized DPA, federal government continually criticized attempting enforce police powers states. That’s one reason earn big bucks. everyone. Many recover problems. Even most. maddening see stupid people spoiled selfish want matter what.

It incredibly immature 

Just bunch babies Last case 1977, declared eradicated 1980. u.s. Russia virus lab. enough law enforcement officers it. want responsibility anyway.

What think happen white cop gets videotaped confrontation black man want wear mask?

Your suggestion work going hear whether want not. 100% sure likely, many new patients elderly people aged 60+, many background diseases. Afaik already cases ECMO ventilators, week second outbreak.

I probably surprised wake tomorrow see another patient passes away... sad, truth happening VN Consumer spending traditionally 70% GDP, 33% quarter. Congress really needs step get money consumers, shore economy gets worse. 1000? rookie numbers - Florida foresee making big political donation future....and charges dropped. It’s American way! I'm sure joking :-) wear glasses, plan wearing face shield. understand mask helpful spread get it. kids sneezing coughing everything else. school mandating students wear masks, know well 15 year old's follow instructions.... would absolutely taking semester time. last semester i'm set graduate december, i'm taking part time schedule anyways, i'm willing get finish undergrad. excited optics job market graduate, you’re saying infections still daily eventually die?

Not sure believe you, guess start looking refrigerated trucks case.

No Floridian go without body bag proper cold storage administration. Pretty sure 60 day window retroactive coverage. would hook reimbursing full 2-month period. Also, there's nothing stopping way expensive 1700/month. laid business worked went bankrupt 2013. going cost 2700(!) month keep coverage. 

edit: high price 'good' insurance. employer paid it, pretty pumped job. COBRA forces take whatever plan employer offered.

You take portion paying, well portion employer paying. employer portion typicallymuch larger people anticipate. bad smoking affect people secondhand smoke littering. Past 4 days straight yeah.... make call. parent perspective district open schools need least mandate masks. nothing paychecks

I’m side. Schools reopen. Yell someone else please Alternatively, maybe I'm simply right wing capable conversation people camp. good hear workplaces taking care employees.

Meanwhile, wife trains nurses treat COVID patients one local hospitals... past four months, they've removed yearly bonuses, they've cancelled annual raises, they're replacing nurses leave (and wife's primary floor 10% staff quit since COVID), none nurses received extra cent hazard pay, they've instituted mandatory overtime. Thanks vox tremendous insight. Nope missing point. ruling left Danish government opposes right pro business faction supports controlled burn herd immunity Swedish style straetgy. However, ruling governemnt extremely politically savvy occiasionally throws bone right wing, overall keeps promise try suppress teh virus via TTI much possible. 

And again, NPIs discuss *have removed yet* speaking though misleading. almost certainly happen caseload continues increase / higher been. Many, many Danish experts warning remove them.

Nothing happened yet, really, talk. expected like Iceland, Denmark go removing NPIs.


And again, Sweden far cases per day Denmark therefore policies esp. anti-maskers charge FHM deserve criticism. registered 322 new cases four deaths
A total 80,422 people tested positive virus Sweden since beginning total much higher Denmark's 13,700ish right now. let's get different rates overall deaths! Sweden got bumped #7 world overall Peru yesterday, #7 many weeks. Denmark #75. know steps across line.. habitually. He's habitual line-stepper. true people then? must catch. Hmm looks like least us come good company bottom like Germany Australia. Interesting considering Germany considered good response covid worse terms change gdp article starts “The China virus...” worth reading. One might still think condoms instead coronavirus relaxing way limit population. true; realize really expensive treat COVID put hospital WEEKS + millions people lost healthcare insurance Covid pay system along employer shitty system employer bases healthcare. last paragraph may dumbfounding people States. best thing internet also worst thing internet: Everyone free access it. I'm planning law school year. Go debt, still delay job market couple years pandemic shining giant spotlight 40+ years exploitation middle working classes America. heartbreaking change going happen. cruel unforgiving way possible. Surely parents send children! fiancée Lowe’s since April makes decent money freight well included bonuses. bonuses super helpful us new family (we almost 2 month old baby now) overall company seems positive environment treats employees well makes sure taken care best possible. people still think there's someone coming stop 30 million new evictions, reckon. fortunately, wear mask time still get infected someone outside circle, typically get milder case. Cranston seems like someone masks up. 

Herman loudly rejected masks. Baseball back, lack plan comes keeping players safe infection already lead outbreak positive cases St. Louis. **Without plan place combat positive tests, league simply canceling games.** 

The MLB might get away schedule shuffling right now, longer playoffs, end prolonging season even more, one playoff games must played. HA HA HA good one seems Walmart always done well relative big box stores times financial depression. Exactly. Opening schools masks, far apart desks, wing prayer cowards way this. 

If federal government cared enough put money mouth is, they'd find army teachers administrators like ready come safe, innovative, inclusive answers. NY operating like country right now, stockpiling tests world. Consulting medical experts abroad well. Gotcha, company work buy stock I've company least 3 years give 25% extra stock every time buy paycheck. believe hold stock certain amount time get bonus well.

It's bit confusing technical. Regardless able afford/budget taking money paycheck buy stock get return back point. could known takes time die? mean guy even want release taxes doctored weather report sharpie would mess numbers make look good? would possibly expected that... US military may brought Okinawa, island pretty far Japanese mainland. friends Japan said government never really took seriously begin with. prefectures went states emergencies earlier year, never national lock down. Japan testing much all. Bars, restaurants, even amusement parks open Japan right now. Apparently central government even promoted domestic travel last holiday. first second worst-hit nations terms total cases

Which really useless metric. Per capita really way different nations compared. food come everyone home? Good starting wars, sucks acquiring real victories  Part expensive healthcare product private insurance system. Medical groups get different reimbursement rates insurances contract itemized prices get inflated extract money insurers. network insurance denied claim, going inflated rate dropped head. Usually work finance departments, that's organization individual's competence.



Medicare terrible reimbursement rate compared commercial insurances (BCBS, United, etc), typically require lot bureaucracy. Medical businesses can't help prefer commercial insurers. Moving target medical insurance plan reimbursements, inability standardized pricing, malpractice insurance, etc... Lots expense US medicine comes complicated payment system lots different reimbursement regulations liabilities.
 


Example: injectable monthly medicine arthritis well $1000 without insurance. commercial insurance, plan may cover 50% cost. manufacturer offers ""discount card"" cover remaining cost. Pharma wants ensure stay medication, they're still getting insurance company's money - grand scheme things, that's still big financial win them. run ""discount card"" benefits end year, request samples doc company nurse, pay pocket, go without meds.



And example include cost MD appointments bloodwork, insurer covering one lab group another (""oops went Quest instead Labcorp network...""), fact injectables available generic use legal loopholes stay brand name. Oh lose/change insurances, may again. 



The government may mishandle Medicare All, may also massive improvement insurance dungpile. Sincerely, someone works Insurance/Billing major hospital system would OK job present form becoming obsolete. Battle royale  said that, national government literally running program increase international tourism (!!) past month, is... extremely, extremely stupid thing right now. possible new wave sparked foreign tourist

1) letting foreign tourists! fact even letting foreign residents, recently.

2) 'Go To' travel campaign domestic tourism Japanese, foreigners.  even frightening me. know night come screw around - like changing guard yeah I've always impression even common cold deadly first emerged. true? Future generations probably get covid19 times year wonder could killed people study found individuals straight don’t believe coronavirus even exists, 56% get news YouTube, hand, cornered 5G falsehoods niche, 60% erroneously believe link 5G virus getting info video sharing Twitter played different role dance deception, conspiratorial hashtags #covid19hoax #plandemic helping spread theories global audience. Florida, Texas Arizona ""NBD!"" attitude towards lockdowns 

Look thats working rn

God forbid hurricane bad well post clear, saying insane many kids get sick ANYTHING point. truly disturbing. I’m 20s wouldn’t want go shop without mask. 

Everyone gym wears mask since reopened though. combination time frame demand?  Indiana many city schools around Indianapolis go back late July. normal since I've lived here. [Mandatory Even *Rocky* Montage. . . make Biden plunger? :) Yes ban, religion. name personal autonomy free thinking right? parents right now? Fauci working had, faithful science. 

The science telling say 'masks work, wear them'. faithful it. understand, guy charge believes stupid things 

This literally nothing matter addressed, namely, reason people might distrust dislike Fauci? Noice. 

So get like dope T-shirt something? prank right? one lost mask case

this wildly incorrect. multiple states, counties, municipalities ordered outright ""everyone must wear mask public"" lost. shit, kentucky's AG filed TRO governor's order. governor texas slapping local ordinances. cannot enforced fine criminal order. even start it, lose court. blatant violation separation powers anything state legislature impose requirement, addition numerous rights (first amendment, fourth amendment, fourteenth amendment).

what withstood legal review allowing businesses require masks. like regular dress code requirements, require mask. case, failure wear mask criminal trespass.

Eyes mouth high-entry area, hands high-access area. breathe low viral loads immune system able respond, might able catch on. expose high viral loads, situation much riskier non-linear way. That's one reasons health workers higher risk catching even better PPE used.

Particles accumulate surface filters concentration increases, that's filters work lower particles passing through. stuck surface mask much higher concentration would inhaled. school reopening working even better MLB don’t think it’s “Christian Nationals” stupid don’t want wear mask.  think it’s stupid people may gravitate toward religious crutch nationalistic tribalistic less open outside ideas.

Honestly, given farce I'm grateful daily number COVID cases decreasing, however slowly, growing exponentially.

'masshealth' works great...out college, trying find job, free insurance year found job. State state much different. free health care country big US much different smaller countries Europe. rates going insane month now....we're screwed US....

Hmmm global pandemic might able become homeowner state! sad. Oh I’m worried getting money. That’s legals issue mine. far know job currently jeopardy, lines credit cash reserves stretched thin. Drug overdoses might fact supply chain issues causing people get drugs unknown sources combinations used to, using alone one call ambulance, fact mental illness pre-existing comorbidity drug addiction already causes loneliness isolation would exacerbated social distancing orders.

Normally buying things almost always cheaper HD similar item. used work Ace definitely overpriced, closer us. Menards sponsors NASCAR really wish one near us. places mask mandates law, executive mandate.

Lmao. Well can't speak American government many Parliaments break weekend Thursday allow representatives travel meet constituents weekend. they're going break they're debating holding votes parliament.

Don’t forget that. train heart ofc. Yes cause getting rid trump would getting rid guy started deadly conlfict human history killed 7 million people concentrated killing facilities. Yes exactly same. Humm 🤔🤔🤔 LOW $180c 10/16 then!!!! Sucks ask source provided cry change subject. Also get news r/worldnews anything far right presymptomatic people spread virus, contagious day two start exhibiting symptoms. Buy time kid fails ""the sniffle test"", already becoming less contagious, unless Monday, already infected people going infect. qualifies case moderate, flu huh? live there... here... whatever; it’s exhausting, especially things control first SOE, they’ve getting worse month+ haven’t done anything (functionally) admit “conditions reinstating lockdowns” never intended followed—as soon conditions met, changed mind making weekly advisory panel.

I’m tired wishing country city would care health people more. But... delves political opinions, guess. Anyway, I’ve edge since shortly dropped SOE. “The buck stops elsewhere.” personally believe R0 somewhere 12-18 range. virus operates entering cells, hijacking them, using multiply. seem well versed topic. unreasonable assume virus much better entering cells, also multiply much faster? Saw study yesterday showed every exhale, infected individual expel anywhere 1,000-10,000 virons. even American tourist there? Schengen closed???? One patients 28... report real number deaths, fuck would make fake number compare proportion Florida? could possibly gains irrational nonsense? Yeah Coloradoan, think going bad here. pay $1400 2 bedroom apartment (split room mate), cheapest apartments area. paying since April, like $6000 owed month, plus next months rent. Good luck getting money someone nothing bank account job. given buying house area, I'd lying secretly hoping ""housing collapse"" maybe pipe dram could become reality one day.

""Not dying"" pretty low bar ""harmless"" rating. muh taxes take beta blocker keep IST (inappropriate sinus tachycardia) down. still exercise 5 times week eat healthy diet. gained pounds 6 months know it’s quarantine eating said healthy food. didn’t know weird interaction COVID betas. Police whip people India, people accept normal part policing. There's loads videos showing YT. Plus 1 day masks family picture first thing grandma says going back church. Lesson learned guess. Awesome! stay safe king built shed coronavirus, saw firsthand Home Depot substantially busy literally ever seen it. It’s absolutely nuts busy. Even it’s clearly still busier, like lockdown. time eat children! Work college, Senate. Even going online slight reopening, project 70 million dollar loss year. let go lot staff. campus closed, mean costs police maintain campus disappear.

But agree, saying years college, ""experience"" overrated need get rid ton projects double tuition. truth is, people America want everything low cost free. remove events, sports, landscaping, etc... choose different University one things. public needs decide want... Cheap, lots extras. can't both. easy Google search. go People want creep towards UBI using COVID push it. kiss hairy, extra fleshy lower posterior biological form. know relevant article incorrectly state North Carolina governor Republican. Roy Cooper Democrat. Miami doesn’t want here. Wtf anyone think organ replacement easy. Climate change difficult reverse Nd ain’t like take ppls cars away Nd isn’t like they’re gonna stop production factories world every Trump business ever too. I'd appreciate help give getting word out. MUST closer scrutiny numbers: accurate transparent reporting critical assessing controlling pandemic. However also tremendous political pressure show public ""good"" numbers indicating authorities successfully managing crisis. exactly circumstances data scientists could pressured bosses ""massage"" numbers. 

Coupled major non-transparent change data collected. CDC strong fact-based science tradition, generally resisted attempts apply political pressure. HHS history, solidly political control President. 

Now, can't say sure happening data -- people HHS collecting data know sure. say looks suspicious, especially circumstances. also decided lack transparency process followed here. less lethal, countless studies already. infectious. good way look it, ton people making choices expose virus.

But students, especially K-8 say absolutely expected miss time. take don’t live Utah? It’s wild place here. Also stark difference Salt Lake County Utah County.

Salt Lake County mask mandate since June remote school fall semester. Utah county almost nobody wears masks protesting plan person schooling required masks. G? understand talking point. Yes somehow masks work one way. don’t wear one selfish. also remember told wear one excuse totally buying it. college student, really worried returning campus. say kids spread it, trust me, college kids make WAY worse. legit terrified moving back college seriously hesitating, wouldn’t move back didn’t already sign lease apartment back college town November. fear getting corona,and feel lot people underestimate it, good feeling get it, especially going campus, I’d much rather stay home take online classes. unsure stay home lease, feel screwed things seem getting worse. suggestions do? help would appreciated. many deaths result economic collapse lockdowns? could went like Sweden far less deaths both. like spending time faking dog eating homework would taken actually damn work.  I'm boat. home year even vaxx released. First round never completely safe. took drug deemed safe FDA lost control muscles severe debilitating pain. thank see many get f'ed it. rest world gets health care.

Oddly, somebody like handed keys next time well. episode awesome. One episodes I've watched too. Alcohol poisoning blood stream/liver related it? …. clutching stomachs 

I guess one points stomach liver hurting ?!  think actual appropriate shutdown may happen new president elected sworn office. Everyone understands ""free"" means ""free (or negligible cost) point service"". Mom probably shopping anyway. spent plenty time hospitals!

Come on. normal hospital scenes, exception people PPE. I'm saying Covid doesnt exist. images particularly alarming. Lol death row label pays largest single aircraft accident history crash Japan Airlines Flight 123 Mount Takamagahara central Japan. killed 520 people. Currently COVID-19 killing Americans rate 2 plane crashes every day. graduated greenfield(where is) parents mad student can't speak nationally two Lowe's frequent several times week requiring masks months employees shy shouting anyone walks without one on. Nothing unites people election year like common enemy. Trump chose vilify China instead virus. Oops. 50 pretty young me. Yes, correct. clearly missing something straight issue ""lockdowns = declining cases time"" ""no-lockdowns = increasing cases time."" sure this, ok, interesting fact. Anyone words help encourage high school teacher that's terrified go back? Dogs test odor samples contact people. true, tell right Jordan doesn’t give two thoughts ability worship. wants protests stop.

And despite opinions, Fauci policy maker. He’s speaking expert constitutional law, public health official. questions meant policy makers. Ive saying thing since day 1. Interstate travel needs prohibited (deliveries fine).

Its possible way effectively deal virus... [Jim Jordan fishing sound Fauci attempt put stop **lawful**, OUTDOOR protest. ""but.. but.. churches!""

Seems intresting article one largest Democratic LGBTQ organizations, ended endorcing Cuomo, LGBTQ Nixon. pandemic, often would tell people that, disasters concern me, I'm much worried people react disasters, bad reactions often multiply destruction whole lot. 

So, yeah. Covid cemented belief me. wow las vegas hospitals offer family health insurance employees? mention pressuring workers continue coming work never funeral child, take it. decide whether study compelling not? point out, stores closed pretty much redundancies. 80% stores within short distance another profitable location. vanity project old ceo never made money cost run would ever bring ( 2 Manhattan stores)

They also opened stores replace closed locations. Agreed. comment mostly countries virus control (i.e Greece). course condemn actions gym San Diego goverment suggests gyms closed prevent spread virus means close. I'm it. suggested ideas applied Greece countries. Smiling someone's death? someone horrible allergies, really hope lead dogs place sniffing us. overall could really good thing it’s truly effective. problem. work load doubled part time job need. Suddenly literally 150x sales. They're enforcing masks, people fucking everywhere. throw extra $150 drowning work, risking families health, people rude hell, meltdowns store. Like c'mon. Limit people building. Make put mask. Make coworker wear mask. anything celebrate much money making right now. three dollar hour increase wages, already low mean much, cutting current situation. Especially find covid affecting people organs. Like sweet, I'll die guys make money.

Now, let people take four weeks off, two paid. change could take four weeks cut people could. took month could come back put policies place made feel comfortable going work. though. live two high risk individuals can't afford get sick die. maybe, will. ultimately, appreciated token gesture, quit, back couple days.

Not really ideal mate  SEC announced morning gonna in-conference games only. feeling pretty soon they're gonna no-attendance games, too.

I think wanted fuck around possibility of, say, LSU playing half-attendance game UT DKR (half capacity: 48,000). ""Coronavirus exist"" - Floridaman talks renting hotels use shelters months back. Unfortunately, warehouse workers also closer interchangeable cogs machine. time train replacement couple weeks most. time replace white collar worker several months, followed 6 months ramp period. They’re still interchangeable cogs, easy.

Also, pool talent warehouse workers everyone who’s young, white collar workers, it’s limited, especially experience. Ah makes sense  U wont going. really think so. vaccines - Oxford least one Pfizer Moderna, - relatively widespread distribution then. 

It's still guess right now, lot hopes relatively normal late spring 2021, even. Oxford get approved fall least one Pfizer/Moderna vaccines approved end year, decent chunk population vaccinated February/March-ish. 

So even we're officially pandemic yet, spread ideally drastically slowed thanks vaccinated recovered. Man oh man, like actively trying make right conditions revolution forget, sort garbage?

People getting cra-cra start carrying pepper spray ... 😑 Yeah, Right. We're finally exposing virus nation least mostly eased winter time. feel really, really good living Vermont right now! Looks like state without predicted cases.  many meaningless deaths? people value different things.

Parent 1: value kid getting sick education suffer.

Parent 2: value kids education low risk severe infection EXTREMELY low risk death. 

Neither wrong. Skip dishes (Canada) option add extra tip go restaurant staff well, nice. hope gets added services well. statewide school closures align statewide measures caused difference? account statewide measures? Still beinf better fucking Peru isnt accomplishment. Sweden one richest countries world, Peru pretty poor comparasion. fucking hope Sweden statistics better. yes Swedes massively arrogant. rest world learned now.

I live there. Nobody wears masks, people go like virus all.

The difference pre covid none.

The government uses international media say everything swedes following basic rules. true.

If come sweden see life goes usual.

The question UK, Spain, Italy others spikes cases opened sweden despite live lives normal new cases.

I think swedish government telling truth know saying get downvoted that's think is.

You'd surprised normal life sweden. Go Spain, UK notice people wear masks many businesses taken measures people sit close.... sweden.

So trust data. want pretend virus gone sweden removed black list companies repopen economy affected.

Sweden country put economy first. Spain's economy going chose people's safety first. Italy.

And yes, swedes super arrogant. told people dying Spain poor. give idea think. We've told PTO cover absence covid related testing illness, apply unemployment. quit, I'd say close contact. worst possible come see vaccine approved October hasn’t started rolling out. know take credit say best distribution...and looses three months sabotaging roll every way possible.

If vaccine approved October Bette ready ROLL Fuck Amazon. burn instead actual Amazon. lol that's city, stupid, stupid fucking city. Bad news, since politics lies science. Trivial example: dead healthcare workers. can, barriers developing. Right now, model getting stronger cat 2 scenario know idea children immune even came from. far know, experts clear beginning: Children absolutely contract it, they're very, likely suffer severe illness. maybe miss something early pandemic? much going guess could've missed article two. may useful individual take long, numbers affected help officials make public health decisions. probably research viruses, HIT, Immunology works. Damn looks like socialist behavior, that's enabling resturant owners take advantage workers decades, might coming end soon! know not.

Or necessarily care. Urologist also expert demon sperm L anyone lives Saskatchewan Since beginning, I've unsure new items refrigerator safe handle. understanding freezing virus makes go hibernation, closer temperature freezing, longer virus lasts surfaces. months ago, went looking information long virus lasts different surfaces different temperatures. best thing I've found far this: , know I'm reading correctly, know actual temperature refrigerator keeps consistent. ordered received little thermometer, looks like fridge stays around 40 degrees Fahrenheit (4.5 degrees Celsius). think source mentions long Corona lasts temperature; mouse hepatitis virus transmissible gastroenteritis virus seem list anything around temperature need, I'm sure I'm missing something. see mentions ""On different types materials remain infectious 2 hours 9 days"" I'm sure means lives maximum 9 days temperature approaching freezing. anyone confirm and/or provide another source help give definitive answer concern?  TL;DR: anyone provide answer long Coronavirus last different surfaces temperatures normally found refrigerator? Bonuses paid hourly essential employees tax exempt. bonus gutted; absurd Newsflash: Lonely elderly exist everywhere. Elderly care homes shitty everywhere. civil suit massive damages, pain suffering, PTSD, etc Well next hurdle getting Americans get vaccinated. idiots continue idiots. I’m sorry, contractor bad enough. Billionaires don’t care normal people. also know Lowe's anything ensure safety employees. mom disciplined asking entitled customer move 6 feet back. told writing could ask customers move.  Says hypocrite feeds crap buy labeled ""made China"". joke. $1000? That's ridiculous, scale income/assets.  I'm confused point. 

At first indicated US would well vaccinated cannot force countries vaccinate.

I asked explore little I'm sure I'm understanding correctly. dishonest be? No, schools re-open, peak occur exponential growth sets within student populations. think ill take sharknado coronicane Everything else closed too. People stopped riding trains going offices bars restaurants. correlation finest. causation. Big difference. America leeched world stop shilling corporate communists

Edit: unlike idiotic frothing China, America actually still leeching world. confiscating test kits Italy, Germany early pandemic, entire global trade system US printing infinite amounts $$$ bills buy anything wants countries free cost; system place America biggest military history world used crack skulls world leaders tried move away using petrodollar.

There lot irony calling China leech, America literally biggest leech history humanity. familiar pluralization? 117 ""hundreds"" Italy averaging around 200-250 per day non-migrant population. lying implying Italy's ongoing cases driven migrants.  driven facts, driven desire throw extra dash racism baseless conspiracy theory spice like-minded knuckle dragging morons. say seem know audience.

And blaming Mexicans cases rising south back June extolling US response low death rate. I'm noticing theme here.

""Judging today’s death toll, it’s obvious Mexico raging epidemic United States’ epidemic rapidly improving (ie 5:1 death toll today). explains lot issues southern United States, clearly reopening related, given spikes aren’t happening states like Wisconsin fully reopened mask culture."". say: See, public schools failure. Can't even keep kids safe COVID shootings such. Everyone needs send kid expensive private school system. Oh, can't afford it? bootstraps? Start pulling! Yep. always matter delaying inevitable vaccine.

We manage that, least. Even deaths 10× know, still little compared expected deaths. Whish, oddly enough, started wearing safety glasses everywhere. first studies came saying airborne, knew time wear them. Also, illusion break moment kids classroom test positive? *Woke* That’s fine. Doesn’t mean human responsible helping curb infectious diseases history mankind. black white can’t someone really great without insisting greatest? Deaths UK past 5 days 456

Deaths Spain past 5 days 12...

And UK restricting flights Spain? government headless chicken, lockdowns unwarranted. government needs held accountable 25,000 people discharged care homes without getting covid tests. Mysteriously deaths drastically dropped soon stopped this. Well starting seem gone smoothly switching data cdc hhs... sure, let’s throw experts people governing experience replace with. Hmm.. dunno, reality tv stars? turnaround time generally, testing much except give us partial snapshot two weeks ago. totally right. university mentioned anything testing plans, doubt major component opening classes. I'm DFW (Tx) smaller city suburbs absolutely inundated students. 40k undergraduates alone town 150k people.

Ugh, thoughts Boston :( bills mount either ignored, homeless, kill self. lucky new job back work....but doubt hey, gonna nuke existence. that's period. glad treated right! Yeah. thought Elon alright pandemic. clearly not. No, like measles still exists even though we've got incredibly good vaccine it. still totally gotten rid polio spite terrible disease. covid-19 pandemic likely set back polio eradication years reduction NGO work stop polio.

This thing spreads easily get foothold rather easily. Combined anti-vaxxers asymptomatic spread get virus go down. He’s also engineer looks testing HCQ worked combination steroid. seems did, again, since seems work (and Fauci seems incapable simple google search) try it, first people less likely die side effects, people. want good treatment soon, let’s try this. Science needs practical research. test lab fifty years probably still conflicting results. send country see works.

If Fauci tell us “I told so”. it’s worth try isn’t it?  guy called hydroxychloroquine vaccine cure coronavirus, told wearing mask necessary March? wide ranging issues lonely old people family basically abandoned them. shitty state Swedish care homes. general arrogance careful something could kill them.

I mean fuck, countries leader called young people outside much shit, Sweden? Löfven decided specifically call 70+ year olds unexplainable reason. Probably so. misleading claim medicare would require massive tax hikes. money currently paid insurance companies redirected medicare enough. comfortable sending kid, don't. Thanks, apologize follow MLB closely. going work reopening? MLB seems like lot players lot games. seems hard implement ""bubble"" like sports. suspected, plan want act like business usual. *Saskatchewan entered chat* know ex-nuclear engineer thinks data inflated removed loop, data accurate. hurts head talk him. dont disagree found article too.

I also found snopes article: [Did Lowe’s Donate $25M Minority-Owned Businesses, Home Depot Founder Gave excerpt indicates Lowes PAC percentage-wise Republicans less total $.

Relevant text: 

The Home Depot political action committee hand contributed total $1,495,000 Democratic Republican federal candidates 2020, 44% contributions going Democrats 56% Republicans, according campaign transparency tracking tool Open Secrets.

Meantime political action committee Lowe’s donated total $540,500 federal candidates parties, 30% going Democrats 70% Republicans, per Open Secrets.  can't tell sarcastic post not. not, family association = level accumulated knowledge understanding comppsychology.

Not always. companies set give employee's bonus amount, say $500. want employee's actually get $500 bonus, accounting pays around 800-900 see $500 paycheck.

Some companies offer bonus's time worked, general performance. cases set $ amount bonus, management decide post tax bonus amount.

If sales, apply. getting $50 bonus working covid, nice company pay $80 employee's actually get $50 bonus.

Opinions don’t matter, idiotic denial factual scientific evidence different thing Fixed. 

We get around 100k comments day, apologies don’t always get right. Fair point, perfect example. instead, optional vaccinated?

It could argued easily actually WORSE vaccinated wear mask least see someone wearing mask. way simply look tell they've vaccinated not.

And I'm making ""anti-vax"" point, think people insane. time, respect ability choose. Similarly, summer camps, private schools, sports leagues, etc, right require them. mandated government agency, exactly isn't. combining antibody tests tests get numbers? trying lose job fam Every time mention China committing Genocide. get bunch votes bunch recent comments. arrive late, Dr. Fauci waiting patiently show up. walk eye's light up.

Dr. Fauci - (Face turning red)I'm sorry, put's away zips up.

Goldishfreckles - still getting paid right?

Dr. Fauci - (With slight sound annoyance)Yes, getting paid. must grabbed wrong bag. new masks proven able kill virus. straps way short.

Goldishfreckles - I'll throw goggles watch finish face. uh yes will. im sure point people like get hungry enough put mask. air filters claim kill virus don’t really kill all.

There’s resurgence industry ionizing units cause aerosolized particles clump charge filters clumped particles settle reliably. generate little ozone less UV.

This uses filters much faster. Suddenly you’re pulling dust air incredible rate. get downstream almost entirely clean breathable air. virus particles sit filter eventually break down.

The reduction aerial dust nice side-effect. even require less surface cleaning, deal less asthma, etc.

Any system claims kill viruses (UVC, copper, etc) probably emphasizing wrong mode droplet-based disease. 'MURICA!!!1! Yeah, explanation Hong Kong problems. Universal masking cultural currently mandatory subject large fine. Imagine vending machine ended killing Johnny knoxville dangerous stuff done. really. around 700k new visitors per week 6 ""external"" cases per day (out less 100), would say still pretty great. greatly expedited. Otherwise commending quickly they're making progress. They've admitted get feedback normally would time constraints. read it? thought swim goggles. seal, might look silly, don’t care.  [For take excuse watch share video. much going on, hard summarize. personal favorites are:

- Kenneth Copeland actually human being?
- acolytes sort mumble repeat rantings

Edit: [the longer version actually even Damn right be. Back back years turn country civilization ungratefulness. need something(healthcare), republicans going see rightwing policy guts need most. Yeah probably won’t see still, nvm. says story. hire cop stand front door. place secondary employee 20 feet building, walkie-talkie, tell cop customer immediately taken mask entering. Also company spent equivalent $32k per employee stock buybacks 2019.  flushed right drain.  Another $943 million Q1 2020. like non-americans come underbid american terms salary fall back home countries' social services. americans need extra cash cover social services.

so inheritors corporations able earn greater profit greed foreigners working less.

also addition lack strong union means certain groups people paid less. minority immigrants paid least naturally higher demand. inheritors hire white male us citizen last resort normally highest paid. hiring practice allows inheritors workforce people willing work slave salaries minimizing number us citizens hire. creates gender racial discord prevents people seeing what's going on.

inheritors take profits earned scheme use usurp democracies throughout world. example brexit one fruit scam.

so answer multi-ethnic multi-national group inheritors protecting private health scam. using profits destroy country well. stop countries privatize health plan.

profits crime ultimately used you, always. It’s good question. we’re lucky, it’s COVID relatively easy vaccine target. could prelim studies look good. People known thing called traveling. live Pa populated areas far away less populated ones people like going areas get away. Better give sort fire. References:

Now Lowe's best friend need add new laws existing ones cover kind situation. [existing Swedish law governing dangerous contagious already mandates people infected disease must isolate themselves. comply force used make sure happens. sure seems support law sort policing describe happening Norway.

Still reason attack someone, something must happened pre attack /r/unexpectedarresteddevelopment Even crappy masks something reduce rate transmission. Every little bit either way adds up, terms bad pandemic going be.

Of course, getting high quality masks average people would godsend. keep hearing PPE production even close catching that. watched assault first time went back rewatch reading comment.

This odd phrasing. literally one social media company would believe priority would vulnerable nursing home patients staff, older people and/or underlying medical conditions front line healthcare workers. vaccine manufacturers already ramping production “at risk” launch vaccines. risk meaning ramping production capability knowing if/when they’ll approval. “Wtf, dick wasn’t itchy sex. could possibly itchy days later?” basically every employer ever?

Winning!! lot wishy washy math, plenty room error here. generally speaking, coronavirus deaths follows positive diagnosis 2 weeks. knowledge hand, compare US coronavirus cases US coronavirus deaths. US cases peaked April 21st. peak cases April 4th. Even end April coronavirus tests seriously lacking.

Coronavirus test results next peaked April 24th. However roughly 2 weeks later amount deaths period nearly half deaths April 21st. necessarily data manipulation, appear proper. 

Even enter May tests still hard come by, Coronavirus deaths continue plummet positive cases slowly goes down. late may June testing becomes much common, see rate cases *continue slowly drop* rate dropping since April 4th! testing picked seen influx cases, never happened.

Also since enough testing death rate vs case rate remained consistent. didn't.

I can't tell true numbers be, tell way cases vs deaths moved strongly suggests manipulation. Remind 2 weeks They're real doctors way HS Principal real doctor.

Great news US Admiral reporting CNN. they're artificially leveling infection numbers constantly 50k tests daily often closer 80k 100k per day before. LOL, get old style welding goggles. I'm sure I'd pop xanax access it. Beyond paranoia would baseless, unfounded irrational fear... irrational take precautions even though likely spread airborne pathogen, still contracted surfaces? I'm 30 year old high risk person, I've seen lots cases athletic people much younger prior health conditions dying requiring lung transplants. Like this: 

So, yes, worth living like increases chance survival. saying think hand washing reduce chance spread ridiculous paranoia? implying let people die it’s expensive save them? Nice casual racism Dude that's literally worst thing could do. lockdown would damage virus point. need close further, need open more. Spend Bill first starts House Democrats. Creates 1000+ page bill pass uses fear say.... quick, pass Americans. filled corruption fraud. know one reads bills pass. 

So.... keep extending never ending shutdown keep people government welfare unemployment. Shame small businesses close try open go businesses. Feds keep printing $$$. So... never disappears also admitting holding awake life end timeline vaccine proven yet. means risk life literally never change vaccine matter what. 1 day back folks. see picture students back school. taxes cigarettes already go funding child health care among programs aimed towards youth.

Oh shut rushed vaccine bullshit? 1) vaccines three months safety trials anyway, it’s efficacy 2) long term effects rare new technologies mean detect easier 3) phase IIII make sure rare effects get caught quickly 4) there’s safe way make fast vaccine, doing, crunching four places: A) funding B) preclinical C) manufacturing D) transiting trials/combining phases. Notice going skip SAFTEY. making sure it’s safe, yeah let’s discourage folks taking vaccine save millions effective cause there’s like .0001 chance could hurt something cities need bring refrigerated trucks deal dead right now.

I'm worried American political pressure brought bear testing process standard one saying mitigation factors taken.

There reason FDA highly respected around world reason is, understand it, thalidomide.

Given Trumps performance 3 4 months back pharma guys Fauci first met Fauci saying year / year half Trump said like that. pharma guys weasel words let Trump think said 6 months (but actually said year / year half) Fauci jumped make sure clear record would vaccine Trumps preferred timeline.

Why would trust vaccine pushed without following testing regime? would love bloody vaccine. know built rules reason based good things happening. smells political. 

Trump downplayed virus also supportive idea bad skip testing? mean...

If one hierarchy health politics NGO whatever addresses reason accelerated testing going think political &amp; money. basically sensible position have. People claiming stuff need provide proof. one is, glossing it.

That’s happened Smallpox. eradicated smallpox, new virus taken place. vaccine, first vaccine way, expected point life you’d get scarily high chance dying. There’s reason people used regularly 8+ kids, weren’t expected make adulthood. handful places figured milkmaids survived cowpox likely survive smallpox less severe symptoms. Egyptians even figured form vaccination involved inhaling powder made skin lesions. example younger brother chosen first born son pharaoh younger already survived smallpox elder hadn’t yet. risk death high risk it.

Smallpox part life thousands years. Odds point you’d it. eradicated it, Mother Nature sent us covid. People really dying 4-5 months. deaths haven’t even really begun yet.

FEMA usually logistics transportation resources states emergency, makes sense FEMA director would talking ADM. JOHN POLOWCZYK, LEADER, FEMA SUPPLY CHAIR TASK FORCE: this

Whereas 'let's make liferaft / figure plan get Hawiaii"" shows different approach. 

It also kept mind statements made context Sweden budgeting whopping 5bn krona antibody tests, barely PCR contact tracing. compared neighbors budget little nothing antibody tests much PCR contact tracing. proof actions: antibody tests tell authorities herd immunity spectrum. Also, started dipping baby toe 'immunity passports' saying positive antibody test certain things others can't visit elder care homes. 

Sweden's strategy controlled burn herd immunity stated Tegnell infamous article praises UK's herd immunity strategy. happening Denmark unfortunate, based right aligned business interests pressuring government stay open. Denmark's strategy still TTI. always thought would involve cluster outbreaks contained. something Sweden even attempted since rudimentary TTI infrastructure small municipalities good degree. Sweden breaking guidelines asking people contact tracing bad joke since demonstrated work (in Denmark less). Meanwhile Lupus patients rheumatoid arthritis can't get it. ""your post removed purely political"" statistics. 

If low number women actually regret abortions: majority kept kids, especially abortion-legal countries, willingly. large sample, article generally supports I'm saying (25-30% regret children): means 70-75% willingly children regret it.

Forgiveness self-healing mental exercise need involve someone else's actions. Bibles core stance non-Bible followers can't controlled attempt made control actions. 

Again, confuse cultures forgiven individual absolved wrong immune transgressions mentioned again. act moving forward acknowledging scars.

I‘m simply commenting idea researchers running trials throwing “poor people” wolves somehow.

It's bit like ""half full / half empty glass"", Tegnell quote. Two different interpretations. One thing's sure, claim herd immunity via infections would end point Sweden incredibly easy dismiss:

Sweden's deaths cases continuous decline, yet they're keeping recommendations. Contrast Denmark, one neighbours, happy loosen even active cases increase. ""Controlled burn"", I've heard kind strategy called. delicious faces. Nice result economic downturn? whole entire reason extended lockdown criticized?

Remember quarantine supposed ""just chill home 2-4 weeks dies down?"" 4 months later, 30 million Americans unemployed... Meanwhile, americans spread virus game refuse wear masks kill people.

This service, hand, indoors people spread out. definitely agree mistake. Everyone least using masks indeed stupid many people indoors close together relatively extended period time. easily could done outdoor location spaced people apart. :( could argue day, clearly getting point. 

Let crystal clear:

THEY BAD. VACCINES PREVENT THEM. EVERYONE KNOW GET VACCINES. SCARED VACCINE NEW. 

COVID KILLS. Maybe spend money getting testing ? Yeah I've actually seen great documentary came conclusion you. think hard doctors. people want something want it. might even placebo effects. However really indication HCQ likely work. found work patients already hospitals. course small studies 500 corona patients 0 deaths HCQ mean much! HCQ really work publish numbers corona rates people take HCQ since 15 years diseases? feel like HCQ issue treatment like $10 year nobody got interest $10 treatment basically enslave world drugs $2500 one pill. unreasonable say? 
 
Also HCQ much less dangerous antibiotics? suggestion like 1 pill week one every week. That's lot. work soon know? Unless everyone keeps ignoring positive studies true placebo groups vaccine trials. case, believe using another vaccine . way can’t tell deleterious effects are. 16 days NYC moment 40-50% increase it’s crazy. wonder it’s regular drinkers drinking heavy getting fresh new drinkers drank before? Mutually exclusive means can't both. Absolut Sweden Hmmmh...maybe fix pandemic situation...we fix drinking problem! Hire bouncers closed bars clubs. let’s see tough “I rights” people are! That’s it! couldn’t find life me. Thanks! understand concern. I’m parent two young kids, 4 1. gives comfort knowing daycares montessories world stayed open throughout pandemic, including US hotspots (daycare considered essential service, unlike school), data points much lower covid infection transmission rate among kids 5. yet single confirmed child teacher transmission age group. Don’t ask that’s case kids age seem super vectors viruses illnesses, that’s data saying. Covid strange. Islands never easier. goes years years years? happens if/when never effective vaccine? think done step back look big picture reasonably likely scenario vaccine looong ways off?   

Just clarify dismissing opinion, fear many people looking -big- picture here. tried true pretend happening strategy. It’s nearly impossible pinpoint surges protests states also reopening going on. education was.. partner New Zealand got tested weeks ago chest infection free results next day I've also spoken friend Rhode Island wanted test returning Florida. took 3 days organise one, another 3 days tested told 6-10 get results. really point stage trying contact trace return positive test. There’s good chance thing going keep pulling East stay well coast. keep eye out.  exactly think lockdown is? can't re-define whatever lockdown whenever anyone points negative externalities caused it. 

This nothing fear going hospital, procedures screenings cancelled due lockdown, categorised non-essential closed, resulting deaths.

The side-effect pandemic lockdown. 

When focus entirely COVID ignore cancer, cardiovascular disease more, happens. people expect riots we're saying poor people workers also test subjects? phrase ""further complicates"" assumes lot 'debate' beforehand, idk actually changes anything basically COVID deadly first place warrant drug mild side effects. Got it. I'll summarize top comments. general, viruses go away unless completely eradicate them, difficult (we still measles, polio, etc). Saying around decades necessarily mean dealing current level now. plague still exists, big deal back then.

Furthermore India blocked release threatened them.  India, manufactures 70% world's supply hydroxychloroquine, banned export March 25. Trump called Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting supplies, ban reversed Tuesday; Trump threatened “retaliation” India refuse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also one companies even allowed sell Even though Ipca Labs U.S. Food Drug Administration import alert, barred selling U.S. since 2015 violation good manufacturing practices 

Again, see trials shut organizations test producing results shut down? Dr Risch never mentions good studies shut early. Also none studies linked using hcq+azithromycin doxycycline reliance Dr. Risch trustworthy voice makes 2 studies linked invalid anyway.

funny one topic actually getting traction don’t let doctors decide best patients really impressed provisioning National Guard staff polling places vote... testing sites people get checked C-19. 

I suggested two different uber drivers swing Alliant Energy Center (Madison) order get free test even symptomatic. level exposure justifies free. \[Had go urgent care could drive myself.\]

I work lab processing C-19 specimens turn boogers yes/no public. 

I really want see masks on. 

I want see law enforced. really bad sign 3-4 days seems fast. 3-4 days slow end things, 1st order contacts symptoms.

I love happy ending. That's rather presumptuous not?

Imagine one going America work, bringing family. moving back Australia one partner wants closer family. Next Imagine return 12 years later family passed on. amazing, hope roll dogs everywhere.

In Alaska, live, state testing new arrivals airports. caught lot visitors prevented spreading Virus.

The governor announced going stop program, state running testing supplies need save testing capability residents.

So six months pandemic, hand still tied regards testing going loose best tool prevent new cases entering state.

We need dogs. Move Georgia. Apparently churches funerals still going on. Yea got tested today moving apt. Took 4 hours results peep post history fool Australias system perfect stretch imagination. There's lot issues current system. give federal government credit getting program called jobkeeper going within week bit. Basically paid $750 week people employed. upping already existing job seeker around $1500 fortnight. 

As said, there's lot issues system. see effort atleast put forward help people financial hardships. Especially since added 600+ Monday change method accurate.

Individual counties may issues, Texas state seems trying best accurate transparent. fair, work rehab facility patient getting occupational physical therapy deconditioned COVID. vent couple months before, improving, stable enough come rehab she’d three hours therapy day (it’s intensive). working therapy one day died threw pulmonary embolism (blood clot lung). also tell coworkers young children daycare school. either call baby sit sick child sick themselves. spread everywhere didn’t stay home soon enough. course sarcasm... made really obvious... can't believe one read like that... side effect super powers? sign up? He's wrong. watch, fear tactics go magically away come Nov 4th. (or later date unlikely gets moved) Anyone else's life spiraling control right now? Struggling unemployment, I'm precarious housing situation right roommate moving out, relapsed pills, feel mentally like shit seen friends able exercise much I'd like. like everything kind cascading piling becoming worse worse. It'd tolerable end sight really looks like shit going go years permanent. effects going life going felt long, long year lot major ways. feel bad lost anyone personal yet suffering less lot people's. takes lot piss Canadians! Congrats, America. Universal Basic Income solves this. avoids entire situation. sits place, replaces means tested benefits bureaucracy cultural issues associated it, precludes need emergency responses like this.

#Universal Basic Income Bouncers usually get smaller guys behave. sure Karens would react though since Bouncers rely intimidation get compliance. Karens usually crazy head intimidated. lie sounds dangerous. Receiving placebo lower someone's defenses start acting like received vaccine. Since America, likely people receiving placebo get COVID due thinking got vaccine following guidelines like would received anything all. comments uplifting. It’s nice hear meal positive. Respect Covid-19, don’t fear it. wear masks, maintain distancing around others wash hands frequently. isn’t guarantee won’t infected. 

I make decision traveling long ago. trip help family member. would easy bail out, end life can’t help family? Took precautions still enjoyed trip. 

Anyway, feeling bit one thing help reflect last 1-2 days anything made happy. find things “fill cup”. 

Stay strong safe... I’m scared it’s new! I’m concerned backed people money reasons trust vaccine gone extensive testing others have!!! people forget happens Rushed vaccines? 

1955, inactivated polio vaccine developed Jonas Salk declared “safe, potent, effective” following largest public health experiment nation’s history, involving million schoolchildren.5 Within weeks, however, miracle vaccine intended end scourge polio stood accused causing it. Years development, Salk vaccine rigorously tested preparation massive trials. success trials led understandable outcry immediate, premature, public release vaccine. Five pharmaceutical companies given Salk’s formula left produce vaccine without significant oversight. speed took precedence caution, serious mistakes went unreported. One company, Cutter Laboratories, distributed vaccine contaminated live poliovirus 70 000 children received vaccine developed muscle weakness, 164 permanently paralyzed, 10 died.

This one example. many detailing happens rush vaccine.. don’t act like valid reason concern Anyone got link pre-print?

I guess article trying imply suspended coronavirus particles float above, presumably lighter air? idk. calling bull suggestion.

Only possible causation see would taller people confident could lead taking risks. RemindMe! 4 months Denmark number active cases 5 months, 4 per capita basis Idk many govt. OK 

But they're certainly OK more, huh? kinda term ""controlled burn"" apt. this, understand virus well enough yet make hard fast conclusions. Everyone probably seen German study found 78% people covid heart damage... even asymptomatic underlying health conditions. 

Until actually know full scope virus does, best people make assumptions anyone safe. really need look pictures 3 seconds attaching article We’re man... we’re here.

My 6 yr old daughter beside set neighbors/ kids exactly let kids play together since cautious. Saturday went local pool eat. She’s devastated obviously aren’t allowed play together anymore. never even thought get switch partners . Video definitely helped . far advanced cure... probably 6 months left I’m lucky Good them! definitely making wring assumption doing. Oregon, took hour results.

Curiously, gf tested time. results, also negative, also took 5 hours. I'll wait amd see happens Guinea pigs first thanx drug matter label Christians another form racism. 

Judging group always bad thing. remember dumbass predicting I'd saying ""wait another 2 weeks"" saying 2 weeks later said number deaths start increasing couple weeks cases started spiking end June. would argue it’s cheaper train dog detect virus people, instead manufacturing coronavirus tests take extended amount time deliver results. far Russia stealing vaccine information, they’re stealing quickly developed vaccines still safety trials and/or early stages development. really sound trustworthy? don’t  Better get gets Going form 8.5% 7.5% testing increasing much cheer for. filthy Cumans  Iceland's numbers riduculously mean .. country take serious national measures prevent even single case Covid? long talking younger people chance death *very* small. even point death .. well .. people die. Would shut country single person dies flu well? guess troops die wearing body armor may well wear either, huh? pro-life party cover ravages covid innocent little children. collecting data, problems! Kiss children hold tight folks Tennessee send fate fall. Link? is. guess troops die wearing body armor may well wear either, huh? Imagine taking pregnancy test getting result delivered baby. love took comment, lol 1 4 chance got buddy fucking metric used... LOL. 38.8% ""near time high January"" 

So say 50% sounds bad.. makes sense unemployment is. Even asymptomatics damage. mods going lock thread well? Christians: Love Neighbor holy wholesomeness..

Also Christians: Im wearing mask. learn live it.

Normal people: sure I'll wear mask means lower risk potential spreading virus elderly immune compromised may die it. Well move restrictions, infection numbers go up. many times already.

700 acceptable casualty rate. 0 going happen.

The background matters, Arabs live bubble affected much many restrictions. Maybe increase summer traditions. Like make wedding parties july. something different since got infected IDK what. Cities arent charge collecting property taxes. event, deferred california. Along collection sales tax.

Who collects property taxes, municipalities? Ah fuck, bad. really bad. Ummm, re: middle paragraph. That's small percentage stupidest people America. also people think descendents green aliens. people beleice thkngs Russia still fits bill sundowning power way many nuclear weapons way eager keep boots ground. 


So lose global hegemony status we'll boat Russia way many weapons. Banks can't work borrowers defer mortgage payments mortgages securitized sold investors. needed government implement system missed mortgage payments course entire pandemic would automatically covered government backed loans would come due end mortgage. wouldn’t say panic right word, feel people worried one. 45 new cases today... good. Suck tinder girls! Nothing puppies . love puppies . dogs using one smartest dogs . thanks developing news Tells us know, really. disagree, sets stage bias. solution all. solid economy built one thing, durable economic infrastructure actually continually need use. Redistributing money bandaid, pretty much passably acceptable there's enormous inequality, ultimately caused people/system handing money begin with, underscores risk even trusting handle situation...

Looking around biggest mistake I've probably issuing ""essential business"" lists forcing everyone else close. gonna pass regulations, target high-risk *practices*. I'm little unclear state-by-state regulations. Swede. Success, knows, long over. stable communication along, big changes. keep distance, stay away crowds, avoid public transport, work home can. Schools &lt;16 never closed, opening older autumn. feels good forced behavior, lot responsibility individuals. Hopefully immunity help us autumn, don’t get waves, certainly hit spots, since immunity certain groups. days ago, Quest Diagnostics (1 2 major labs process COVID-19 tests US, LabCorp), even *priority* patients, results taking 2 days longer.

I understand bigger news. We're talking people seriously ill, doctors need test result ASAP know whether put Remdesivir. cases, whether safe proceed urgently needed surgery patient exposed COVID-19.

You really need results *hours* priority patients. 2 days+ wait going kill, simple that. ""Data"" aka looking window love I’m literally getting downvotes saying celebrating death bad. garbage people. no, valve. think sick would better wear n95 without valve, people healthcare settings wear valved masks assumed everyone mask. actually quite weird, deaths reported region reports. forwarded FHM reason. really change anything end though. Kushner epitome belief system association hubris took place competence responsibility.

It doesnt matter hard work. say LinkedIn profile. come virus? Arizona state population 7.2 mil, New York State, 19.4 mil. New York 2.7 times larger. Arizona deaths 172 x 2.7 = 464.  4/2 4/19 exceeded number, aaccording Cuomo's graphs reported time period peak 799 deaths 4/8th equivalent 295 Arizona.  Arizona increase 295 within next 6 days perform better.

New York exceeded 700 deaths day 7 days. exceeded 600 deaths 3 days. 500s remainder.

When things spread quickly tends overwhelm testing reported total death figures higher later date figure died home places hospital.  Amazing. Fox News brainwashes 40% nation, nightly. little cases Australia month ago thought completely subsiding wham 723 cases yesterday. awful. sure dogs work, money spent better else where. problem Russia stole lot vaccine info world . guarantee vaccine month. Many countries lined buy Russia  needs crowdfunding pay medical bills, purchase blue crystals Mr Cranston. Aw. Thoughts prayers. suggest read issues rushed vaccines start calling people skeptical vaccine anti-vaxers. It’s dismissive changes whole meaning anti-vaxer. hate comparison. way different nature.

LOLcopterPilot think /s tag needed. wrong. AKA states sacrifice entire population chance college football season. state shutdowns coming covid rages control. Sorry comment got removed. You’ve made even ridiculous. Good you.  Yeah, members discussing donated PCR tests. Unfortunately ""Americans"" sub firmly disagree skimmed it, gets hard listen guy based absolute (but potentially truthful) horrible picture paints every word. correct, reading article dwindled greatly towards end. unfortunately..... Remember beginning pandemic, number one argument keeping schools open, bringing students back soon possible, many kids US go hungry rely school lunch survive? many students homeless?

Isn't easily solved food deliveries (most students presumably live routes school bus) social distanced food bank lines? need open schools we're country. We're facing serious equality social issues. need real leadership real plan action take care things long-term.

Yup. capitalism anything death? think getting better doctors anywhere else world? Sounds like pretty bad restrictions affect infection numbers. Makes sound like Denmark got 700 acceptable casualty rate. 

I wanna comment that. Thank you. wish “masks don’t protect you” idiocy would die. Luckily campus smack dab middle densely populated, low SES area, filled vulnerable minorities, working service jobs, forced serve rich maskless drunken frat boys. might actually turn problem.  Oh wait...... coronavirus vaccine built previous viruses ready less year, yet tests virus still take hours days give false positives? shall all. vote later rather sooner! Stay safe everyone, including hubby’s fam TX. It’s crazy much subverted religion. 

Worth try! would Jesus do?! making ""thing""?! thought christian, care people help people need. really want go church, wear mask. hard?! 1

The Earth  realize teachers fund classrooms right? think communities magically going get PPE hospitals can’t even get? federal government should’ve handled beginning wouldn’t mess. it’s responsibility teachers schools fix fuckup. states 2-3 weeks delay getting test results.

Every time see talk vaccine here, ton people saying they'll never first line vaccines 1950's dangerous new. 70 years. Science advanced. studies peer reviewed around world. There's never safer time first line, arguably there's never better time, either, given easily covid-19 spreads.

I know I'll first line available. hope see lot others well. go babies Sandy Hook owing $2900 tax isn’t really factor here. got $2400 Yes, non-ideal either group, really, gold standard evaluating medical interventions. Nothing else cancels possible skewing variables. That's trial, vaccine rollout. else would know vaccine safe effective -- might either -- pharmaceutical trials better placebo group. volunteers know front trial, though, could getting either vaccine placebo. participants continue normal behaviors protect diligently before. wrong?

Preach.

My gf extra-relieved mask use seems somewhat normalizing, least locale. We're going keep social distancing PPE use indefinitely, even pandemic over. hurt you? Depending state, seek mental health treatment free. forget new wall street hobbyists appeared due lockdowns giving little proliferation phone apps allow trade fly. People take normal dosages HCQ experience that. higher end dosage attributed that. Yes. Good luck.

Not wearing masks public ""banned"" places US. That's stopping anti-science people wearing mask.

Besides, government already well enough job discouraging protesting escalation kidnappings all. Heh doubt would come that, isn’t violent guy.

Can provide data? Paywall Buffalo. couldn’t happier. biggest hoax left pulled, making think mask protecting people people get negative test results back immediately obviously 90%+. complain.

I took grain salt. little nerve racking someone around customers employees 4 days prior actually hospital. 

Can't mandate masks region business might well sell retire. So... is. stay away everyone guess. wear mask ask anyone else well sell it. work. Wrong person, wrong place, wrong business. both. hope stats come out. They’re going good. I'm sorry raging idiots make noise rest us. trust science two-faced politician. reading comments FB bickering cut right middle. changes nothing unfortunately.  monsters Hellraiser, right? mean, reminder protests (of LOT) held Canada resulted ~1% increase cases country wide. Around 15 20, that's counting look 'numbers before' 'numbers ~3 weeks later' also kinda disingenuous. kind art. Make outlook known, show think less believing something different (note: much easier realize may different experiences lead opinion, however ridiculous is). Genuinely try understand believe do. trying change outlook ask questions reveal faults thinking (don't point flaws judgmentally, make defensive). Also bonus points link something passionate about. Oh Yellowstone bingo card September. Noooo, I’m land tree hugging liberal hippies. Big Foot. He’s cool. We’ve got 2 years we’re never coming back. 

I’ve met really cool people here, spattered nonsense. seem like one them. extent get politics, outsider looking in, none says yes, want follow me. far virus politicized, biggest failure I’ve ever seen. could done much good Republican Party, are. business man think “MAGA Masks” immediately. Beans though, beans get us through. 

Hopefully Walmart curbside pickup, makes huge difference. go places masks absolutely mandatory, we’re quarantine 4th time, thanks husbands coworker. people don’t take serious beyond me.

I awareness much restaurant rules actually enforced flouted. 

But maybe reality different seems me. 50 person gathering hung would suggest anyone attend. world need Harvard research obvious? fuck facebook groups tell Democrat hoax ruin america.  /s/ well. It’s funny autoimmune diseases come gang you. Hope you’re finding relief staying safe back mind. 3 days. based research adults I'm sure works kids, timeline:

Day 0: Exposure infection.

Day 1: 100% false negatives get test.

Day 2: people start become infectious.

Day 4-6: 67% risk false negatives, people symptoms onset around day 6, infectiousness peaks.

Day 8: Test accuracy peak 3 days post symptom onset, false negative risk falls 20% (this good tests get), mean get tested 8 days exposure, vary people different incubation period. best result, wait 3 days symptom onset, go date exposure.

Day 14: Incubation period effectively over, 99.5% people would symptom onset now.

The window infectiousness opens 2 days exposure close 11-19 days later, depending research read. Infectiousness peak day symptom onset day symptom onset. data mostly based people develop symptoms clear holds true people remain asymptomatic entire infection. accuracy nasopharyngeal swabs (the 'brain tickle'), nasal swabs reported less accurate low viral load.

Source: False negative timeline: /r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/

Incubation: window: Think I'll losing $5 sadly. bit tbd schools reopening. know college maybe 3 courses online. elementary secondary schools lot operating individual basis deciding open person online; noted though government given option schools resume person social distancing measures made clue they'd pull off. Yes, thought too. Governor's bed DeWine. perhaps someday discover coronavirus invades brain stem low IQ adults manipulates it’s host seek engage activities promote spread. correct, wear pants store would see quickly law enforcement would there. voice roll two episodes Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Jesus christ. hell happening country? UT dormitory large zip code. 

How students supposed maintain social distancing? That's ok, internet delete it. don’t get guy’s problem is. know plenty people hobby gardens give vegetables away. 

When high school buddy’s mom would give potatoes 5 gallon buckets time. Potatoes thing, easily grew hundred pounds year easy. dad always lots surplus tomatoes would give her. 

Maybe it’s abnormal city people, gardening pretty common hobby grew up. Funny massaging different start every one spewing uncertainties like facts. bad unified leadership .. Basically, first study linked argues current literature (current May 20) conclusive enough recommend hcq+az patients. argue merits objectiond major papers discussing hcq+az. 

But another thing keep mind highly fluid situation, (although always) newer studies tend hold water older ones. second study linked published almost month later, results known first paper's authors wrote theirs. also pretty strong methodology, large sample, randomisation...

You're understanding good, essentially op-ed HCQ+AZ effective treatment, knowledge changed since May 20th flu fried rice. like fried rice? nothing compared rioters didn’t wear masks. unacceptable. flu this. government respond appropriately save lives? people rise demand it? Demand lockdown UBI 2-3 months. Well guess won’t worry christian fascists much couple years. What's even better taken 2 year hiatus posting videos this.  Yuba County worst actually. Maricopa populous tracks close state numbers are.  Yuba's death rate equivalent 970 people dying state New York, Yuba much worse.  compare death rate NYC equivalent 420 dying there.  New York City terrible, peak number 599. terms cities, worst Bergamo 3.4 deaths every 2.08 NYC. Lima Peru 2.9 deaths every 2.08 New York City. Guayas Ecuador 2.48 every 2.08 NYC. (on excess death rate comparison).

Edit: city level excess death rates I've seen worst hit order are: Bergamo, Lima, Cremona, Guayas, Lodi, Brescia, NYC, Madrid.

That's wondering contextually everything falling terms severity. Let's clear, wacko Christians dominated airwaves 40 years counting **do** represent American Christians, alleged ""normal"" ones extremely quiet condemning them. every wacko pastor needs two sane ones screaming represent followers.

But are, group claims sane non-bigoted acting surprised people lump crazies. us non-christians, ya'll bucket. know prevent right? It’s called preparing advance shutdown rather forced poor federal leadership. 

States shutdown choice, maybe federal government lead shutdown better economic response. almost like know short term it'll economically bad hopefully control spread virus long term they'll ok. also killing grandparents. Florida: sure we'll get right Herverd Yikes. countries banning American dual citizens now.  that. would best companies engaged lucrative contracts building running efficient concentration camps means culling population. amazing pictures. Recommended click. Man sucks. live Texas. feeling sick got online, searched place 2 minutes house, filled quick paperwork drove got tested, 30 minutes. said 3-5 days results. Got back 24 hours. know that’s everyone’s experience thought I’d give people different perspective Peaceful protest essential American character, national narrative foundations.

So far, clusters spikes associated BLM protests, surprising me. key thing seemingly held outdoors, though many protestors wore masks, too. Ventilation matters.

The clusters see mostly laborers/travellers/socializers enclosed spaces stagnant recirculating air. highly likely masks could help lot that.

But seen alternate world narrative masks paramount tool mitigation, instead partisan symbols, understand frustration many can't get control, unlike rest developed world. can't blame them. I'm huge proponent masks, country 95 million people without single known active case apart quarantined imported ones, bother. recently got EXTENDED recess pandemic. America let people die. They’re direct neighbors China yet single person die pandemic. They’re tougher country, little buddy. make someone's blood boil? expert team suggested since virus likely limited democrat regions, governors would blamed politically would beneficial. really want know federal government confiscating PPE equipment states. high treason? trickle economics folks. Instead putting together team experienced medical personal, goes bankers college friends. Jesus fucking Christ. high treason? see third world countries way get wealthy governmental fraud. DeSantis actually went Harvard - tiny little chance he'll listen. I'd bet house it. know? 

Disney, NBA, cruise industry need make money Trump elections cancels. cars thousands dead peasants. do. give fuck. Let every student exposed Covid, showing symptoms sit room people say go back school. know agree that.  ""changing point view""???

These fucking assholes denied virus real, said wearing masks unnecessary. never changed view. trying gaslight everyone forgetting internet forget anything EVER. 

They still closed-minded fuckholes take next science-based thing claim real.

These assholes changed minds anything. Everything bad could happen happen them. Yeah I've seen mixed reports that. feel like something really know sure while, since like... ""less risk"" mean I'm equivalent someone age without asthma, mean I'm risk random healthy 50 year old?

I'd thrilled I'm actually even higher risk, knowing simple chest cold me, exactly planning throw caution wind. Especially pregnant. vax lab, many researchers think working specifically virus? Ama reddit video youtube see like labs teams trying save world? Florida man would rather shoot virus ok laugh fascist foot soldiers crushing freedom press right assembly? form escalation too? So... Stop buying alcohol while. go path.  Little doubt truthful number least 100 times higher. dumb mother fuckers still wondering rights at. I'm sure point list. ICU physician US working intubated COVID patients said mildly sedated also morphine ativan. know much awareness have... Looking much (and quickly) whined cabin fever first shutdown, clear willpower mental fortitude handle another shutdown. done first one correctly; is, we're going accept worse-case scenario. internet censors right /s healthy (no underlying comorbidities) people 60 risk dying car accident significantly higher coronavirus. fact, risk latter approaches zero.

the number young people without underlying condition died disease vanishingly small. 

even without social distancing would likely change much seen recent weeks many young, healthy people turned positive virus, necessarily symptomatic let alone fatal them. also cannot prove negative. GA we're looking 6-10 days test result. Yep Covid tracking project hospitalizations dropped 2000 overnight nuts. 

All experts said switching new reporting system dumb idea middle pandemic hey *they* know amirite? You’re right. Random birthdays everyone got vaccinated, maintain supply orderly administration. mean US govt, current leadership? lot loaded language comment. see 'remains seen' already seeing inflection occurring PMI employment data. also need cognizant fact Sweden highly reliant international trade well international passage trade therefore extent held hostage economies larger neighbours.

Additionally, deaths could prevented (namely old folks homes) outcome goes without saying done think anyone would debate that. view based analysis mortality data, deaths would hundreds low thousands took approach also fully locked aged care homes three months. Would worth getting it? Yes. people getting 11k from?  

The CDC excess deaths don’t show Texas anywhere near 11k excess .  Curious.  feels like dam break see country that's done well Vietnam starting break records cases. Yikes.  ""Covid party""in New Jersey 700 people attendance?  Competence matters. want enough Americans trust whatever vaccine ends getting approved, would help president who’s anti-science doesn’t uplift conspiracy theorists spend time preaching demon semen. would also help president who’s going run roughshod constitution federal troops. Believe not, things *can* actually get worse don’t correct course. already China mean contain forever isolation/quarantine home compromised going work?   I’m curious I’ll probably get shit posted hell. % believe actually get mild symptoms. feel like I’m line freaking I’ll ok.

And anyone writes shit, wear mask anytime public, stay away others take precautions including limiting going needed trips last 5 months Nope unemployment. Although checked dependent accidentally mistake stimulus either 😓 Yeah, I'm near I'm sure they're doing. know northern part state beautiful minimal cases well. go safe fun! Says person cared enough comment. Washington Post absolutely worth paying for.  Yep I'm looking seem relevant compared hit Countries similar pre-lockdown mobility (France, Spain, Italy, UK) density inside main cities (the affected)

Sweden approach cause massacre see better outcome next year. failed everyone failed: nursing homes. Hopefully found way better too. Shhhhh... like talk Idaho. like go church together

Something tells far fewer Christian Nationalists time next year Wtf about? I'm Australian Nobody 0% risk matter strict are. That's simple fact recognize best. Nobody cares. Forsynthia pandemic hydrochloriquin indication pick asymptomatic/presymptomatic cases dogs France right two samples positive everyone thought negative humans retested. cases 3 weeks death trend, see big spike deaths around Aug 14 +/-3 days corresponding July 26 spike. Indoors prolonged contact certainly riskier know confirmed cases infection happened across parties wearing masks distancing. room big, viral concentration unlikely accumulate high enough cause infection unless closed circuit air conditioning creating loop, see Chinese restaurant case study note one studies wearing masks. person access surgical N95 mask, would better protection fabric masks, fitted properly. YouTube videos fit medical masks properly. Take care!  would sacrifice life perceived freedom unfortunately:( Deaths far reliable cases. [Scroll see graph daily deaths. There's always couple days every week low numbers: weekends. It’s nice plan. really wonder prioritize teachers’ students’ test results useful. article pointed out, right infected person infect many others waiting results. Florida pay it. /s Good doggo safe harm 50% efficacy better one comes around?

It 50% efficacy, safe first criteria mentioned. Obviously might reasons wary product, 50% efficacy seems like coverup reason thinking safe.

Lol cause countries leaders misinform people promote demon sex doctors doesn’t mean rest world careless negligent. 100 million poor outbreak happened locked whole month mandated mask nationwide. thats u handle pandemic Arizona entered chat. agree federal government. thought article Staten Island? read response would know don’t think schools open everywhere communities rates low, everyone wears masks start elementary school risk transmission lowest, safe open school.

``` say getting crushed, chance catching damage catching it? made props show.  would anyone lockdown second time benefit first one wasted? really think we'd better we'd waited April May start lockdowns. may deaths initially, people may taken COVID-19 seriously 1 fewer enough done it. viral ear infection Sept 29th. Tinnitus, hearing loss, dizzyness, extreme vertigo. day still suffer hearing loss, constant dizzyness tinnitus. People say way covid, I've read articles hypothesizing virus around December, November may mutated current form. pretty hard feel anything ppl tbh. bad sooo sad. literally listed asked for, still pretending see it. 

At point, know, care, whether malicious stupid. 

Either way, ""discussion"". Montgomery 80. remember back May June curve starting go took break looking worldometers. I'm back checking page multiple times day. idea number deaths/million/month looks like US, graph posted numbers Sweden. stock market isn’t economy. It’s valuable long traders. propped may getting propped later well. said took **week ten days training** dogs get identify COVID-19 scent,"" Taylor started March training dogs find COVID-19 virus,"" Jeff Minder Top Tier K-9 Madison, Florida said. part different group, working dogs identify said dogs also identify virus **saliva**, even seen success people lot patients coming here, they’re scared,"" Minder noted. ""They go get test, hospital says it’s eight days 'we notify you.' swing here. minute, tell them: ‘Nope. don’t’ 'Yep, it.’ hospital tests confirm every time, dogs tell patient.""
He said dogs’ overall **success rate 96 percent**. 
Taylor said, part, dogs cannot contract COVID-19. seen animals becoming sick COVID-19,"" Taylor dogs giving **real-time results**, that’s faster current tests, take days get results. Nationalism isn’t particular religion, political system. don’t think that’s accurate claim. many reasons people don’t wear mask. doomers said america would surely surpass yesterday's death toll 1465 welll let's see today's number shall higher, lose doomers Alright know many commenters live hurricane prone spot. 

I grown up/currently live NC. also lived FL year. 

Hurricane Matthew barely Cat 1. damage hurricane family ever lived through, par according mother hurricane Fran. flooding absolutely catastrophic. 

What happened Matthew already saturated rain weeks before. even though wind negligible, rain dump sent home town edge left people without power WEEKS. 

A cat 1 nothing sneeze at. could nothing, I've seen cat 1's lead people riding around boats awhile. 

Also, hope storm changes track, ride coasts like avoid losing strength depending far inland go. also stall REALLY fuck shit up. stalling storm W R T. can. wear mask. I'm guessing he's infected shitload dumbass fuckers Like said, ""half full / half emtpy glass"". me, sound like planning drowning. own, though.

Also, must regrettably inform Danish strategy that's controlled burn herd immunity strategy. Cases rise, yet Danish government plans open country even more. inhumane downright 

 $10,000 per child per month ?! would Putin's plan maximum disruption prior election. really. may picked patients mild symptoms HQC, hence would suffered less deaths. redistribute wealth people face economic devastation?

There's plenty nation obscene amount never use life time. Disney make money theme park Florida? wut mah barbee-cue pool partay! /s    Honestly, it’s numbers game. hope one vaccines “work” always chance none will. Think definition “work” minute. would argue (I’m neuroscientist isn’t field bear me), best vaccine we’ve got MMR vaccine measles specifically (it effective preventing infection 97 every 100 people it’s given - 97% effective).

The flu vaccine, although necessary, far less effective (depends year - lets say 65-75%). I’m going get difficult create vaccine coronavirus reason hasn’t done yet (besides lack funding). 

If get vaccine this, hoping 80% higher efficacy. mildly educated opinion, going insanely difficult. 

So, multiple vaccines good two important reasons: 1) supply companies making similarly effective vaccines; 2) one could way effective others. Another thing start one decent vaccine (let’s say 65% effective), would also argue buys us time another one developed reach 80% higher threshold. Morbid curiosity confirm beliefs pessimism world (and especially America, country I'm hardly fan of) fucked. Hmmmmmm there's kind trend cant quite put finger on... imagine time highs stock market would reach second shut down? STELLA! Likewise ""No one Russia Corona, spike pneumonia cases"" parties, one ever speaks neighbors knows are?

Because I’ve lived cities never knew neighbors. curt nod elevator. 

But dorm experience different story entirely. mean, ""The Upside"", fine guess think he's trying MAGDA: Make America Great *Depression* Again. Another key factor are, health workers calling general public support fangcang hospital

People may trust government time, trust health workers.

Depends source include pre diabetes link data analysis, less accurate frequently collected aggregate data better highly accurate individual data gained slowly. role Xfiles episode holds Mulder gunpoint makes drive West  build RBG bubble. word “triage” stems French trier, means “to sort.” idea was popularized in late 1700s French Revolution, Napoleon Bonaparte’s campaign Egypt Syria led large number wounded.

A French military surgeon, Dominique Jean Larrey, came the idea sorting casualties for care based severity soldiers’ wounds, regardless rank. (Larrey even treated enemy soldiers—earning reputation spurred Prussian calvary save life captured.)

Two centuries later, goal triage emergency medicine remains same: provide greatest amount good greatest number individuals. large parts United States face soaring numbers coronavirus cases, medical staff grappling stay true principle.


Eighteen states are currently what’s considered “red zone” White House coronavirus task force, meaning 100 new cases per 100,000 people last week. Additionally, 14 states currently 70 percent ICU capacity occupied.


Texas has stopped reporting which hospitals exceeded capacity COVID-19 patients. signs point caseload crisis: One children’s hospital Houston is now admitting adult patients, U.S. military is sending medical staff help support state’s beleaguered doctors. week, county Texas announced COVID-19 unit full, transfers overwhelmed hospitals becoming impossible. “Our doctors going decide receives treatment, sent home die loved ones,” Starr County Memorial Hospital said news release.


In Arizona, intensive care unit beds are 90 percent full, morgues run space, counties are ordering refrigerated trucks store additional bodies. midst surge, Arizona first state enact crisis care standards—protocols healthcare systems overwhelmed catastrophic event can’t provide normal care patients.


Such dire straits raise important questions: best care patients aren’t enough resources go around—and make triage decisions.


Triage fundamentally balancing consequences, says Nathaniel Raymond, lecturer Jackson Institute Global Affairs Yale University, teaches disaster response. One terrible realities triage, says, decisions zero sum: Treating one person usually means treating another. it’s important emergency, medical systems agreed decisions made fairly, communicated guidelines transparently health care providers public.


The first principle triage make ethical decisions. Raymond calls “Star Trek problem, Kirk Spock,” referring 1982 movie starship officers choose serving “the needs many” versus needs one person.


“Ethics setting, especially triage, exist one purpose: identify conflicts,” Raymond says. “Ethics eliminate tragedy. cases, application ethics contribute it.”


During pandemic, medical staff tried first rapidly expand hospital capacity. Veteran’s Affairs Ann Arbor Healthcare System Michigan, meant building walls, piping, ductwork make negative pressure COVID-19 wards, air captured try avoid viral spread. pulmonary care physician Hallie Prescott says wasn’t enough. work well, triage plans must be vetted practiced advance. Otherwise clinical decision-makers put huge amount stress.


As cases began materializing Michigan March, Prescott part triage team responsible allocating scarce resources need arose. team ran mock scenarios running ventilators, prepared system activate crisis standards care. Fortunately, haven’t yet so.


“Having tell family due circumstances, you’re able offer certain treatments—the thought conversations strong motivation everything possible avoid shortages first place,” says.


Planning ahead also helps hospitals innovate. COVID-19 hit New York, Kathy Hibbert, director medical intensive care units Massachusetts General Hospital Boston, helped set highly unusual system: MGH regional hospitals worked together transfer sick patients, also resources ventilators competing hospitals based capacity need. peak Boston’s surge, helped MGH cope 500 patients ICU. kind cooperation competing institutions rare.

“To knowledge, it’s never happened before,” Hibbert says. recommends doctors hard-hit areas start contacting counterparts now, “even they’re yet capacity crunch, lines communication open.” don’t even call assistance money. call stimulus money. It’s meant economy, help people. Apparently writers game played 'what wont brian do' stop worried might kill him. *cough* *cough* emu war solutions adolescent fantasies people's revolution nonsense

Việt Nam eradicated 2 first waves Covid19. hit back much virulent strain / D614G mutation Vietnamese people even health worker hospitals Đà Nẵng city (epicenter outbreak) became lax / careless. 

""HANOI, Vietnam (AP) — 99 days, Vietnam seemed defeated coronavirus. wasn’t single reported case community transmission. single death. handful cases caught isolated border, otherwise people returning normal lives. country 96 million people hailed globally standout success.

But week ago, outbreak began grown 48 cases six parts country, including three largest cities, forced authorities reimpose restrictions many thought put behind them. experts worry outbreak could much larger currently known.


The outbreak began last Thursday picturesque coastal city Da Nang, thousands tourists taking summer vacations golden beaches. 57-year-old man hospitalized fever tested positive. condition soon worsened put ventilator.

Health authorities swung action. man’s case puzzling. hadn’t left hometown month tests family 100 possible contacts came back negative.

Then health workers found three infections Da Nang weekend. Monday, another 11. patients health workers Da Nang Hospital, man remains critical condition.

On Monday, authorities encouraged 80,000 tourists leave city providing extra flights. Hotels emptied thousands canceled plans visit.

Then Tuesday, city put lockdown. packed beaches closed, roamed patrolling security guards. order events left scratching heads. Surely fleeing tourists potential spread virus further?

Indeed Thursday, authorities found 43 cases, including two people capital, Hanoi. cases seemed link back Da Nang returning travelers.

The cases included American patient last week Da Nang Hospital moving another hospital Ho Chi Minh City south. companion also tested positive.

Authorities reimposing broader restrictions. They’re closing nonessential services banning large public gatherings Da Nang nearby cities, closing bars clubs Hanoi. They’re also planning test 21,000 people capital recently returned Da Nang.

Pham Hien, owner noodle restaurant Hanoi, said longer seated guests instead offer takeout service deliveries. said business hurting abide government recommendations.

“What important citizens join hands together government fight,” said.

Just virus crept back remains mystery. Authorities say think source outside Vietnam time virus different strain.

“One big difference I’ve noticed wave previous one cases right now, lot severe,” said Marc Choisy, Hanoi-based bio-mathematician Oxford University Clinical Research Unit.

He said high proportion severe cases could indicate hundreds asymptomatic cases remain undetected community.

“It’s likely disease transmitting silently moment,” said.

The government, meanwhile, cracking people smuggled country avoid quarantine, making string arrests cases smuggled Chinese nationals. authorities yet make direct links people smuggling new outbreak.

Vietnam’s struggle contain virus even initial success reflected places around world. Australia single-digit daily increases outbreak exploded city Melbourne month. Thursday, authorities reported 700 new cases around Melbourne, record. places Hong Kong Spain battling new outbreaks seemingly virus control.

Vietnam’s quick actions face latest outbreak reflect speed government reacted initial virus threat, experts say helped halt spread.

In mid-February, example, Vietnam put 10,000 residents town Son Loi, near Hanoi, three-week lockdown, even though 16 confirmed cases entire country time.

The Communist government also used texts social media deliver concise instructions citizens. even added short messages every phone call.

By March 22, Vietnam essentially closed outside world, stopping international flights shutting 900-mile (1,440-kilometer) land border shares China.

Whenever authorities saw even single case community transmission, jumped contact tracing, lockdowns widespread testing. country also drew past experience defeating SARS outbreak 2003 able limit confirmed coronavirus cases recent outbreak 416.

But Choisy, bio-mathematician, worries authorities caught coronavirus wave much later cycle first wave.

“When haven’t heard new virus cases while, begin forget quickly return normal life,” Choisy said. “You get used it.”

The authority havent found F0 yet, think given focus quarantine people instead. Almost 100,000 tourists home-grounded and/or traced (the MoH required everyone Danang since July 1st report local authorities), almost 10,000 related confirmed cases quarantined across country. Danang total lockdown, extent Wuhan know serious even food delivery services banned. 2 cities semi lockdown everywhere else high alert.

Danang tourism &amp; travel hub entire region. industry trying hardest recoup loss summer season, state news outlets heavily promoted domestic travel support it. outbreak effectively killed hope foreseeable future.

Its okayish Hanoi here, hope doesnt come 2nd lockdown. first one hit economy quite hard already. time comes dont doubt government pick poison pill again, alternate total collapse economy. healthcare system incapable dealing thousands infected cases like richer nations, tracing quarantine best weapons pandemic. hide behind dumpster comment xD there's molar came  Medical manufacturing here, go 400 surgical masks daily.

One could derive absurd notion teachers can’t get teachers sick data. think officially, corona death rate higher cancer year US.

Except I’m hearing it’s 3 feet now. proper preparation coordinated effort know we're going take 3 months shut literally everything. Enforced probbably people roaming streets, likely military law enforcement. Mandatory lockdown except perhaps hospitals EMTs. others allowed would stuff like linemen people maintain water suppose citizens. would difficult ask possible. people going throw shitfit way declare martial law. going work, people stand it, outset either. personal favorite mine role tennis pro dies car bombing “menace, anyone?” episode Murder Wrote. Fax machines still standard Japanese business practices. Especially transmitting legal official documents. Email, scanned docs digital signatures considered reliable.

This course country rubber stamp (that easily stolen, forged) also used signature legal documents. That’s hard. Pretty sure Godzilla less 5 mins screen time. movie sucked ass. he's cooking meth pay bills... brain fairy tale! know, disgraceful literally post exactly that. IMDb sure something too. involved winners “head cases” (two total episodes actually remember show aired) “franklin bash”. age illustrious acting career would quit acting. Glad didn’t. explode already existing explosion? Put Tupperware car case pee. Fuck that.  Public bathroom? can’t imagine courage ever use one again. gonna take lot COVID kill Heisenberg. Hahaha totally forgotten scene. number enough trigger lockdown country, Malaysia. 463 precise. It’s getting worse worse. Multiple countries done studies indicated effective.

Doctors ones charge determining effective not. Anecdotal evidence shows absolutely nothing used treatment. doctor fifty patients puts it, recover, evidence? No. People recover people could easily known.

But randomized, blind study several thousand patients compared number people see significant increase recovery. That's evidence. testing group increased heart problems it. That's major issue.

And take that, go across dozens countries trials reach conclusion. That's enough evidence.

Any doctor still prescribes irresponsible. help harm them.

If doctor convinced leeches cured could, okay using would you? course does. He's gotta lick boots orange overlord though. -- can't wait leave, stay job kids get bit older. totally agree. getting quite terrifying, honestly. happened March.

Stay school. One million doc! One million... governments media report issues people start caring tiny little bit? Nobody concerned city, zero. winter everybody catch disease goes like that. Children ten seem transmit virus much less often future, wear mask. 

I don’t say rudely. think pandemic highlighted need adopt hygiene standards countries like Japan South Korea. feel ill, wife does, even kids (if they’re old enough), wear mask. Watch less contagious things throughout household. house, wearing masks infectious seasons like flu season.

The proposals doctors OP nonstarter. reset. People went first lockdown whatever cushion had. many people gone, eviction, foreclosure, bankruptcy, joblessness, loss health insurance comes next. can’t expect people destitute save comfortable. political infrastructure support people beyond sending modest checks if/when congress decides it.

Their CFR 3.6% US. If, HCQ miracle drug, CFR lot lower. could mean and/or could mean that... let’s say it’s 70% effective 30% people would get infected. 

That’s understood could wrong though They’re apparently trying find shit SubredditDrama something.  Lol Looks like still slow yet faster method detecting numbers looking for. Yeah, surrender Australia. huge problem. stopped going see therapist February closed although offered online, living another person 2 bedroom house hasn’t given safe place virtual meeting. imagine issue many others well. So, openly admitting wrong?
Or pretending they’ve never set anything? Interesting. told still follow safety precautions social distancing, wearing mask, sanitizing, etc., told live life everything normal? need randomized trials make sure indeed something else.

If went first study looked good didnt verify we'd using HCQ standard protocol right now.

Fun fact: 1918 early report enemas effective treatment Spanish flu. Doctors everywhere started enema treatments. learned two things that:

1. Enemas fact good treatment flu.

2. actually end killing lot sick people otherwise might lived. mean, can't argue science.  bout brilliant science teacher turned meth dealer then? Also, tey get covid results within day school? Again, time Portuguese! White House, State [Health Depends keep turd not. do, definitely third world country. says I’m American? world economy fucked American one. frankly rice beans ain’t healthy diet. Furthermore I’ll happily keep paying rent alternative sleeping fucking cardboard box could that, copied China done. 

* Stricter shutdowns (3 weeks going all, even groceries), grocery delivered government.

* Active cases must quarantine government facility, home.

* 100% compliance mandatory mask wearing

* health code compliance app want go anywhere(basically temperature check stations everywhere, high temps, go home self isolate can't go anywhere health code would red, came close proximity covid cluster, health code would red).

Obviously, require lot sacrifice personal freedoms, greater good, America, here... I’d love know exactly train this. assume sniff items infected individual?

Right sister. Colleges, yes. Public school, hell no. recovered asymptomatic cases would tested positive antibodies. Whatever gave T-cells happened ago. think teach college. shocker. bad. nothing compared horrors flu season. even want think it, but...my clinic saw first flu patient. Strep also back, make things worse. diving science behind exactly makes predictions hyperactive. hope trend weaker tropical storms / cat 1 continues monsters  like that. really sad actually seemed pretty decent basic plan. perfect; least step right direction given knowledge base time.

&amp;#x200B;

A group educated people connections figure shit out; seem great extent.

&amp;#x200B;

Killing plan based political considerations simply criminal. ever accept decisions directly resulted deaths literally thousands people.

americans need food lmao, it'll fine survey conducted U.K. suggests social physical distancing measures put place Covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted people's perception quickly time passed compared pre-lockdown perceptions.

There’s things written this, it’s interesting there’s study well. Here’s link study itself: Private security guard/supervisor here. 

A lot security paid significantly less employees location they're working at. (Otherwise, place would hire in-house guards, would take massive risk enforcing wanted policies themselves, opposed third-party company dealing liability.) 

I live work rural midwest barely anybody makes living wage, think area good example. 

Say get hired in-house Dollar General security guard. make $11 hour, non-supervisor/managers. job prevent shoplifting make sure people wear masks, go hands-on call police situation might require that. person swings touch way, Dollar General hook massive lawsuit, especially physically defend imminent harm way injured person. 

This contractors like come in. DG instead hires us state minimum wage thing, one guards wrestled high school something restrains violent customer armbar injures customer, DG hook, security company liable lawsuits whatnot. 

Contracting security right choice vast majority businesses want security guards, guards need way better pay they're asked right now. None guys (nor me) getting kind hazard pay anything becoming mask police. One guard Michigan already murdered trying enforce statewide mask mandate. customer left came back several relatives (IIRC,) one shot guard face. 

This we're dealing with, people still see uniformed guards think ""Paul Blart."" Dealing reality versus letter got president company calling us ""essential first responders"" kind weird place in. (A lot us certs first aid, CPR, AED, stuff like that. We've got one guy who's certed volunteer firefighter EMT-B, works makes money he'd started EMT, make minimum wage barely lot places, ghastly me.) 

Places enforcing things like mask mandates absolutely hiring security, security industry needs metric fuckton reform expected deal shit like this. We're cops. *some* guards states (USA) close authority police, went school police do, average retail business probably can't afford hire them. better kids LOT students forget LOT material 3 month long summer break. shorter summer break addition fall, winter spring breaks longer, helps students lot.

That seems reasonable. :-) mean fuck people want eat decent, pay rent sort actual life guess. Shame dad can’t pay keep roof kids head Cos can’t work. guess human safe vaccine it. Sigh. even funny meme.  mom went get covid test. Took two days get appointment said 7 days results.

She declined rapidly. Went ER tested results hour admitted her. 

I guess don’t know enough tests understand ER capacity hour everywhere takes forever.  MN. Don’t religions try get people believe believe in?

I thought standard, correct I’m wrong anti-maskers criteria whole town got infected.

I feel like emphasized. *was* plan, flawed rudimentary. spearheaded magnates moguls, far focused boosting Economy even expense human life. plan, even inferior robust scientifically-led plan like SK NZ, would result far fewer deaths lack plan.

But made calculation would selectively kill harm political opponents, threw plan away. stunning display malice incompetence.

Wow. actually problem. less resistant reality

Even work home able actually parent work. Sending child daycare safer sending school. really, really tough situation parents.  spice reprint President Trumps historic COVID speech March 2020.

And woke up. would deaths backdated? backdated what? particular ""today's death"" could back dated? /r/holup act like Americans don’t shit BLM, masks, social inequality, racism - list goes on. referenced article You’re right! really sells performance! types Christians live life want oppose everything Jesus represents. last dying breath plead forgiveness repent.

I've staying home, going anywhere. hear clotting issues Covid/Coronavirus, terrifying is. Personalize subject.  nuanced approach may personalize subject invoke emotion. modest evidence suggesting creating emotion may, instance, reduce short-term prejudice. example relevant COVID-19, one may pose straightforward question someone spreading pro-hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 treatment content: “Would trust doctor giving drug partner?” may avenue fruitful discussion.

Like Red Sox Pitcher? Yup.....and adenovirus, influenza, measles, mumps, etc etc. seems like clickbait title. mean people live income dividends?

That's ""the rich,"" dude. white older average; small (and shrinking) portion Americans.

(Livelihood means creating income- wealth.) remember reading article Lousisville Courier several states like Kentucky, others, much higher normal phenomia deaths spring, offically counted COVID deaths. someone get absentee ballots? That's basically argument Sweden. Save lockdowns become absolutely necessary. 

This American problem seeing similar issues across west Asia. US pronounced due unique combination poltics culture.

Other Sweden covid cases area increasing across West parts world. Culprit fatigue lockdowns. 

The lock downs like bad pressure valve. People complied orders long place. soon losened people went nuts. 

Yes Sweden's approach means deaths short run, people get used restrictions. prevents type fatigue push back seeing right sustained longer. long run actually means fewer deaths. heart procedure prior shutdown. seems like three years ago. UF announced going forward reopening one nations “top research institution” can’t let research diminish. 

Um? What’s point top research institution don’t listen research!!! Like don’t know much value research don’t mind killing professors make top research institution go off.... problem! think main difference worldometer uses probable deaths model (and official sources seems) omit probable deaths wait official.

I’m data analyst career sort discrepancy common everywhere - depends slice data. I’m sure determined. haven’t found anything related +/- . However, look things bit literature slightly less conclusive regarding increased infection rate severity rate. Still points towards Type less affected. Unfortunately outliers claimed bullshit.

Redditors coined phrase pretty well said ""the GOP see power several generations this"". run biotech company, though no, I’m full blown scientist. information comes scientific team immunologists. effectiveness vaccines HOPE enough. I’m expressing doubts enough curb it. You’re looking potentially low amounts time immunity (3-5 months max) meaning multiple vaccines per person per year. Additionally, yes effectiveness multiple strains, far guarantee. 
Again saying faith lies treatments developed make virus’ dangerous symptoms irrelevant. still plenty viruses working vaccines work done years. ton money lower regulations put place doesn’t mean anything. 
This tale caution. Nothing else. serious cases, mild. Well people forced work symptoms positive test comes back. Many people leave house go work. employer doesn’t necessary protect employees held liable. challenge burden proof.  Get feeling average grade schools going C+ (Covid positive).

I’m trying get whole immigration argument here, trying say want help government pay it. shouldn’t hot take. Well, merely one example great many snafus Swedish testing scheme. 100k per week never materialized due system ovestretched, resources unavailable. 

Compare Denmark initially (in March, early April) trouble capacity. figured out. boggles mind months later Sweden, supposedly developed nation, can't. guess really right said Sweden needs compared developing nations unfair compare developed nations. helped change mind issue. Well throwing hypotheticals make sense, would rather Sweden Denmark world power. again, world powers created sit nothing. people country morons. cannot wait dump private healthcare. mention lol Yeah 100M probably fucking chump change company whole raked pandemic.

I guarantee CEOs taking home INSANE bonuses year. think point simple rules easier. Asking mods judge deaths allowed celebrated would instant shit-show. either allow cases ban cases, they've gone latter.

Being told can’t enforce masks “only police it.” awful.
I started back Lowe’s right pandemic it’s crazy since.
The big thing store us enforcing amount people store despite supposed thing place. worked never again.  lawyer private school teacher $4k saved two you? Something right. literally doesn't. proved active shooter training. unarmed unable fight back allows shooter systematically hunt people execute one one. 

For example, there's (atleast 2019) 35 mass shootings armed citizen present scene able act. 35 incidents, armed citizen effective stopping shooter reducing loss life engaging them, 33 cases. Thats 94% success rate. 

The two cases individual failed, one involved two groups hunters woods, El Paso Walmart shooting, unbeknownst ccw holder moving first shooter, second shooter hung back entered afterwards, snuck ccw holder shot im back could engage first.

In 35 cases, amount bystanders injured defensive fire zero. 35 cases amount times police mistook ccw holder attacker zero.   Cannot wait throw year trash. china sucks coronavirus doesnt care immigration status. Taxpayer money go people anyway, either put concentration camps keep home safely. case still people need money live work go outside need to.

edit: also immigrants pay taxes well I'm realizing now. fired Home Depot. incident ""unable"" help customer. worked doors windows back store. woman asked go get shopping cart. ""unable"" help due corded phone desk helping customer. Fuck place. No, epidemiologists influencing guidelines are. course, many politicians listening unqualified constituents quacks resulting shit guidelines. 

So point? Tom Hanks went Greece? Rules thee guess opinion, best evidence shows packing people together pandemic bad. would argue + daycare summer school evidence easily outweighs 1 study claims fine.

Add fact still constantly hearing ""scientists"" hydrocloriquin (or however spell it) every week months sides saying 100% opposite things. clear studies and/or reporting (at best) less clear around virus.

Personally trust application scientific method improve safety quality life middle crises never lower. really hope season go on, keeps happening teams, sure can. Im like 99% sure they're back monday... idk read CNBC. much denial shutdown crowd right now.

There zero indication another shutdown would effective. chance. blew it. do-over. going ride next year protect yourself. purchased tickets since may, cancelled, purchased June tickets , cancelled, July, August, got cancelled. help shareholders, must expectations exceeded every quarter worry. worked great us Texas. :/ guess people calling nationwide shutdown. think people want shutdowns want targeted ones, either certain states certain areas state (US South, I'm looking you!).

I'm Georgia, wish governor prohibit mayors county officials putting place mask mandates. People forced fix homes 24/7. Can’t ignore problems complaining time, busy working, etc. People nothing time now. countries also good bit rural tho See never happen Tennessee going report covid cases school.

[State collect, release data coronavirus cases Tennessee solved! Except obvious choice like suggesting. Even 100% US got (which never happen begin either vaccine herd immunity) child would 0.2-0.5% dying potentially suffer intellectual problems receiving proper education young age. 

Now let's think even many 30 million get US said done. means there's 9% chance x 0.5% chance dying comes 0.045% chance kid dying. that's vastly overestimating death rate children.

Now US absolutely put situation shouldnt actually start looking numbers seem unreasonable think first glance. Lincoln suspended many civil rights civil war, he's hailed hero Republic. strong leaders what's needed greater good. increase hourly $2/hr one month. First $300 bonus FT, I’m assuming $150 PT. next bonus felt taxed. lot people saw issues confusing paystubs. last payday full $300 FT. three bonus far month extra pay. 

Ideally would settled straight $2/hr raise, permanently happy. Still Lowe’s good I’m glad see company make efforts employees. 

Lowe’s giving employees 2 weeks paid leave contracted COVID-19 high risk. Yes, experts wrong. wrong. Many expressed anti-masking sentiments wrong. Anders Tegnell even wrong express anti masking sentiments even data now.

So yes, many studies now. based info even then, strong indications masks work. Again, Ian Lipkin one world's prominent epidemiologists stated work based previous evidence, hesitant publish issue due worrying preserving stock HCWs. Fauci admitted part reason previous anti-mask stance. predicted reason hearing Lipkin admit it. 

Tegnell though must motivations since PPE production ramped meet needs Europe AFAIK. think probably controlled burn towards herd immunity discussed article, among places: 

Discussion                

We found rates deficiencies complaints, defined failures meet allegations noncompliance federal requirements, higher nursing homes reported COVID-19 cases. largest difference nursing homes without COVID-19 cases observed county-level rates COVID-19, suggesting surrounding population case rate high, area nursing homes high risk infections.

Nursing homes care aging adults chronic conditions experienced years declining revenues financial factors made many facilities ill prepared pandemic, stemming spread COVID-19 nursing homes easy. data provide snapshot evolving pandemic states’ reports COVID-19 cases validated, findings nonetheless important, providing real-time information regarding risk COVID-19 infections nursing homes. paying professors racket? paying grad students racket?

It's surely possible dumb. 

Holding surveys shit already know racket, fucking moron.  Never occurred go first thing morning. feel dumb.

Before pandemic, never busy weekdays, marginally easier find help. 🤣😂🤣🤣 oppps let correct hell would Cuomo this? disapointed going route. Anyone work lowes HQ mooresville? ploy (read, Republicans) push wishlist (fat tax cuts protections favored industries) using urgency crisis.

People kept calling Democrats putting bill things want (which yes, dealt things related pandemic, even things like pandemic spread immigrants, relevant issue even hate illegals) back May playing right along Republican propaganda. think things deserved ""kicked road"" badly even merit making Republicans discuss, amend, vote on, think comparable way things? Yeah, either political chump want fat tax cuts protections certain industries. look uninsured crisis brewing states like Texas. That's going get kicked road years putting relevant legislation wishlists. idiot. would impossible prove. knows contact with, touched, etc. blame mask course... seems likely, still new enough know sure. make wonder coronavirus actually different coronaviruses. Maybe ""normal"" coronaviruses dangerous older individuals prior immunity, since everybody gets they're younger less susceptible, resistance time would risk group. Totally agree, comment mostly rhetorical. What?!? Trump lining pockets?!?! Helping another crony out?!?! Color surprised!!!

/s taking many days even several weeks people get results, existing backlog provide ample fodder keep numbers up? STFU, read Rule 5 real quick continue shutting fuck up, moron. honestly really unfortunate. understand parents would want schools reopen. example, low income parents go work cannot homeschool child. A. may lack education teach children. B afford missing work. C. cannot afford someone homeschool child. 

For example, aunt immigrant relies job single mother. barely speak English, therefore cannot educate child. Also mention live boonies difficult access internet, making impossible use online video chats connect online schooling. Also nearly impossible get 5 year old son sit homework, short attention span.

If start debate it, tell lose/lose parents. Yes, expose child Covid would result getting sick, possibly ending hospital even death, come hospital, left huge bill. aunt quit job, afford housing, afford food, possibly end homeless. (Like lot Americans end pandemic). lose/lose. (Of course wouldnt let end homeless) people dont backup plans?

So do? dont wanna hear bs answers ""well cant afford children them"" ""shes immigrant expect"" reality cannot go back change choices, living right present. one case thousands see occur. thousands people end homeless, thousands students fall behind. lose/lose people fortunate enough. 

If fortunate enough adult, stay home wear mask, respect livelihood others. think random woman’s quote lot.

Because *don't actually know* experience ""positive"". patient receiving HCQ recovering necessarily mean HCQ helped. might even hurt, enough prevent recovery. personal experience fine, problem making *huge* assumption actually happened. Correlation imply causation. 

It's actually extremely ironic talking people thread educated enough, including yourself, saying essentially 'well saw saw'. truth is, actually know saw. Anyone surprised? Lol 9k 18% positive rate Home Depot done anything like this? that's essentially countries controlled spread virus approached it.

Couldn’t argued looking countries like Spain Poland Belgium beginning show evidence contrary though? NY. Dorms open. classes online, person. nobody thinks corporations governments billions gain downfall, well entire political parties, nothing gain HCQ successful?

not medical advice Oh I’ll never work graduate college. It’s absolute shithole everyone hates. It’s convenient location. High tax rate bonuses normal.

They're still dicks giving small bonuses though meanwhile, plenty reports kids spreading virus even places re-shut-down schools trying open them. 

I understand someone would ignore stuff put lot stock obviously flawed old study. Herd immunity never past Sweden strategy. misreporting English speaking media, 

Something consider Sweden strategy. whole world seeing cases rise again. US, Canada, Europe, Asia Oceania too. two exceptions: Sweden New Zealand. 

New Zealand geography side. Sweden? Sweden new cases keep dropping. 

The gamble Sweden actually took vaccine coming anytime soon, herd immunity exposure take place long time. 

The hard science correct lockdowns prevent virus spreading. totally ignores social science says: hard lockdowns unsustainable, population eventually rebels becomes impossible maintain. 

Social distancing needs place years months. Social distancing fatigue already set in. Protests social distancing, people randomly shopping grocery stores cause something do, underground parties, congregating parks beaches. 

Also soon restrictions lifted little bit population went nuts. BC supposed 60 percent normal social contacts supposed contain virus. 75 percent. 

Because Sweden went moderate restrictions short term preserved hard restrictions became absolutely necessary. factored social sciences come strategy. 

While might mean deaths short run, long run might mean fewer deaths level restrictions sustainable rest world not. hahaha good call. need get Time Bureau involved. Well, gave money workers, able hit 2Q numbers! goes stock!

Sigh. plan kill poor. could pay. Theres consequences. Medical debt doesnt even affect credit anymore.

Another way saying this, ""Politicians think able kill poor people like politician important specifically create policies appeal politicians support murdering poor people.""

What humongous self own.  This. That's BIG thing R team pushing for. Pretty big endorsement vaccines ask I’ve worked everyday since pandemic began. received $1 hour bonus month April came around $175 personally. staffed ever yet business consistent usual. looked much owner received ppp loans $1-2 million. 250 employees, probably includes whole family “employ” never here. I’m wondering entitled more?

Edit: half employees work part-time 20 hrs week much cases going down. Deaths seem ticking still also. Got’em. Coronavirus blown way proportion none stuff ever needed. created global recession nothing. takes weeks find voluntary, I'm it. better be. keep looking “hhs cdc” periodically. hasn’t really anything weeks. People undoubtedly waiting clear smoking gun stupid even think person classes right now. Sadly, slight possibility death always better choice guaranteed hunger homelessness also lead death.

It's almost like government exists exactly situations ... also held huge sale middle pandemic. Nothing response exemplary. Link working fyi political leanings everything said true. double projected daily sales goal, even though small ass, rural, backwoods city southern Georgia.

If offer one critique, may true Lowe’s shelves regularly empty, cannot keep demand

That partially true. empty holes shelf stock sent, distribution center manufacturer. I'd say 75% holes see store. Things power tools (namely Kobalt, circular saws, jug saws), door knobs, treated wood, plexiglass, flooring (assorted tile manufacturers). least store stores around me. FINALLY getting substituted products different (more dodgy/ lower quality) manufacturers. 
Otherwise, everything said true. 
I'd like say, again, may particular region. another reason always choose HD. Among reasons. last thing remember Cynthia Nixon ran years ago, could seem catch fire reason. Always shop Lowe's Homedepot possible. That's guaranteed gone outside since made rule (was put place yesterday). first time type mask rule made I'm sure general public use aside places mandatory.

Again, moot point none ever happen US, that's essentially countries *have* controlled spread virus approached it. $500 bonus cost less 1/5 total increased profits quarter shareholders executives enjoying increased profits weren’t endangering themselves... scum solely gave trump money another reason didn’t list?

A group doctors researchers previously criticized Swedish corona strategy demand Sweden introduce mandatory mouth protection.
In [debate article Aftonbladet]( 27 doctors researchers question strategy actually aimed at, elderly must continue isolate themselves.

""It time change strategy elderly risk factors come out, live normal life,"" write. 

27 doctors researchers write today debate article Aftonbladet Swedish corona strategy.

They wonder strategy aimed believe results two-part advice young old meant infection continues spread country - younger people live almost usual older people isolate themselves, write article.

The thing stated crystal clear is: 70 plus, everything get infected! 70 plus, avoid contacts. ”

#Researchers question situation elderly

Among 27 doctors researchers Lena Einhorn, PhD virology, Björn Olsen, professor infectious diseases Cecilia Söderberg-Nauclér, professor medical microbial pathogenesis.

They wonder long elderly able isolate forced live outside society.

""That case.""

#""It's time change strategy""

To slow spread infection, address issue face masks, give examples studies show oral protection stops infection.

""The scientific support face masks extensive,"" write.

Even measures many countries applied Sweden, regarding quarantine people close contact infected person, highlight ""incomprehensible element"" Sweden's strategy.

""It time change strategy infection reaches level neighboring countries, elderly risk factors come live normal life."" 3 &lt; 5 things better right? /s say ""small"" said ""smaller"". Also say US it.

Home Depot CEO, shitty, response covid economy turned company, foreseeable future. Congratulations. fact data around world showing young children (&lt;10) poor spreaders virus.

All ever saw unlikely found index case contact tracing. 

But could explained without parents places lots virus going around (school daycare closed, going work store), parents still going house without children. addition Covid disability syndrome we're wave Covid orphans???

/s Good thing - 2 ideas. 

1. made Double post, maybe good (but idk)

2. Use # directly useful short buzzer sentence bigger

#vaccine volunteers needed Good, but: bug feature?

(jk: it’s def feature) 😷 well Olympics. still needed membership turned 21 mid 2000s. NY proof hard, short shutdowns non-essentials path pandemic success stories. 

You could never make national co-ordinated effort. would done state governors, highly enforced quarantine measures crossing borders, tracking cell phone location. 

Longer term, would want see health insurance rates separated states shut didnt. reason cautious subsidize treatment long term chronic health conditions dared virus destroy organs. said virus black? Parent's ordered fridge June got govnerment stimulus check till September. Functioning designed. including 381 severe cases intensive care.

Compared 380 yesterday. made comment March. funneling everyone like 3 stores like black friday everyday big corporations get richer. Yet mom pop would kill 4 people store shut down.

The whole thing asinine. see property owners people, rest folks sheep. Daycares actually completely closed state weeks ago, they've reopened reduced capacity. Also child question allowed building, family members must meet staff curb door drop off/pick up. Things like that. Yes, I'm saying lose job, get injured/ill weeks later, elect COBRA retroactive date coverage loss. (Disclaimer: sit near Benefits team I'm it... could wrong)

1700 kind bargain means covered serious medical emergency. Looks like candidate 7 day pill organizer. cave well. NY many patients know Personally treated hydroxychloroquine successfully including wife’s 95 year old grandmother started early turned around shortly after.

Dude, much % pay goes housing? considered roommates something cut costs? point. Trump wants cook books. death suffering problem, *optics* them. Deception corruption ideals right.

Colleges universities liberal states supposed go Florida March parent's place parents in-laws. thinking back, crazy telling wife in-laws trip might get cancelled thought alarmist. one deposits them, cash immediately go party 'the beach'. wish kidding, exactly happening. save buy campers like. wild. Kind like Florida Man come full circle CEO. that's great, owner still steaming pile shit pushes political agenda employees guise ""training"" raise bonuses? bonuses he's either paying attention lying then, store manager blocking company wide emails somehow stealing money. announced via company wide email CEO every time.

Need point stock prices representative much business company has, much money shareholders make. Yes, said better. 
""If business model includes paying poverty wages, time go under.""

However, economy cannot afford abrupt minimum wage increase.
My suggestion move people UI welfare/cash aid/food stamps/medicaid total rate (but continue UI benefits job search, resumes, trainings), start slowly decrease welfare benefits (maybe $15 less per week) set immediate temporary employer tax decrease + slow permanent minimum wage increase. Hopefully, way families move UI welfare/stamp/medicaid. least Salt Lake City School district decided hold online classes first quarter reevaluate. guess look Granite, Jordan, Canyons see kind cluster develops. health care workers getting nothing heard, racist uncle Facebook, that, doctor yells ""Corona!"" corpse, gets unlimited free money oversight deep state, shadow government. known well established tactic every major retailer, Lowes.

Lowes however *specifically known industry pioneering this*. really debate. Demand certainly up. store benefit it.  Good ole cells :) $600....amd gone.... I’m referencing linking articles economists. 


Older folks extend far past ten years. Sometimes 2020 feels like spoof movie guess varies place place.

Do want talk Sweden isolation without reference anyother outbreak? non-scientific opinion children's immune systems literally built grow up.

Stop hospitals overwhelmed. local city lockdowns based cases TENS/hundreds populations hundred thousands/millions. 

Essentially 1 1500 people test positive, lockdown implemented.

Hospitals never overwhelmed, government held accountable negligence sending 25,000 people hospitals care homes without tests. I’m switching Lowe’s meanwhile young kids seemingly nothing gets done. cousins month NorCal, took two weeks. Started asking quarantine contact trace questions realized already 10 days since test. One cousin already back work. Failure across board. enough tests everyone thinks might get tests, would willing bet % positive cases Texas pretty high. Trump accused China suppressing details reality COVID19 - and, Trump exactly accused China of. 

Projection thing... much like double standards are. recently hired Lowe’s can’t speak everyone offered 17% asking start. don’t pay anybody minimum wage understand. looks like school grades 7 8. thank telling us GOP Health Plan: ""Don't get sick, do, die quickly"" People wanna lick boots  riiiightssss?!? somebody please think rights?!?!?!? /s reminds me. best English language movie Obama years available Republican. want it.

College football even perilous. called huffing? 🥴 might unpopular opinion, really wish Fauci thrown first pitch game. really bad look keeps getting worse. dont think theres ever effective vaccine kind coronavirus though. whole new thing That's nothing. cannot another shut anymore, understand least half people ,especially healthy age 40 want stay home longer cooperate contact tracing. Shut pointless stop virus spreading still going private parties.

The health department know most. contact tracing interview, many cooperating amount spread, doable. work first time, work time. Shut hurt economy virus still spreads anyway. It’s wrapped stop body infecting nurses. local Lowe’s first big store implement mandatory masks, guy sitting front box surgical masks offering people one. walk wearing one says really loudly “Thank wearing mask!” I’ve gotten lot projects done last months Lowe's employee here: They've shelling bonuses expected them, PR reasons not, that's great thing, deserved appreciated! PLEASE let make anyone forget poorly handled things beginning, slow they've react throughout, even poorly they're still handling things. took long stores finally start supplying masks employees, even longer require them, negative repercussions stores flat enforcing company policy COVID-19 handling, even actual state laws. store actively told, store/district management level, well recent corporate internal emails, allowed require customers wear masks, despite state law **that retailer allowed allow customers inside business without mask** *(we're expected offer alternative medical issue preventing mask, curbside pickup, do)*.

When there's pandemic going on, firmly believe Lowe's one better retailers work for. retail, they're little less shitty, pay better, benefits terrible. pandemic? spend 45 hours week worried I'm killing parents, price they've put families safety extra $300/month. I'd gladly take handling pandemic better $300. passing judgment whether go school. 

 Im saying terrible choice. Risk kids getting sick bringing disease home keep home loose vital education. 

The older kids fine. even manage distance learning. young kids worry about. Early childhood education important setting child success later life. 

A simple summer break routinely sets children back significantly. Imagine missing school 2 years (I'm expecting mass dissemination vaccine happen least mid 2021). Taking page Orange Wart’s playbook, eh? 😒 Seems like good choice, considering active cases doubled recently. What's terrifying though despite high increase, they're planning loosen restrictions - experts say worry yet!

Is fabled Controlled Burn strategy? wouldn’t slow burn lockdowns lifted, start fire right back up? “fire” would going due lack fuel, never going out. point fuel would go back fire. UBI great, everyone it!  greed imagine curious stores states stricter lockdowns.

Its everywhere, construction home improvement stores considered essential everywhere. lady tell yesterday questioning Dr. Immanuel racist understand West African culture. apparently supposed give leeway people try mix medicine religion know better part culture. even made excuses Dr. Immanuels medical malpractice saying different education punished happened. 

They tried compare practicing medicine voodoo slant Mormon doctor practicing medicine. Except know, Mormon doctors put personal beliefs aside treating people mainly Mormon patients choice get treatment something. matter them. literally thousands physicians documenting results experienced matter. Saddening enraging. first offered seemed like would rather us stay home symptoms. things progressed, need positive test result get paid. show symptoms stay home wait test results, don’t get pay. we’ve sick people still coming work risking getting others sick wait test results. Luckily we’ve one associate test positive past couple months. Almost studies I've seen painting outline variant operates recent. major one showing spread across world early July. mutation brings we'd known now.

I think we're approaching stage ""knowing now"". new studies released rapidly, several troubling anecdotal reports surfacing last days showing may actually contagious. [This Michigan responsible 180 new cases 8 days. family went one birthday dinner party [all 14 family members New Jersey reported [30 lifeguards tested 2 beaches (17 one, 13 another). Can't forget [1 man infected one night bar hopping South Korea either. tons incidences like playing daily across US. 

Regardless, skepticism matter much appreciated clearly alone sentiments (it appears scientific community split issue). I'm definitely going research things brought get better understanding topic. Shit fascinating, honestly.  University Spoiled Children. expect? risk injury season finished, MLB struggling even get teams field. Fox News article says “now” said “not.” difference. “GCJHS says parent’s allow kids go school if:” lists conditions staying home. drive extra 15 minutes avoid HD terrible. harsh WalMart maybe It’s true. town they’ve packed ever since March. work cellphone store March April busy managers change schedules keep up. big companies wanna act like they’re suffering reality it’s time cut much staff possible. blaming Covid bring massive amounts revenue everyone’s stuck “extra Vacation” kept boasting about...  hourly workers pay one month

Ftfy Replied wrong person... 

Several scientific research pointed children play small role, any, spread. know majority wants hear. Even pass $1,200 gone even return ""vacation"" . joke. know nobody going come protest lack effort towards solving problem virus. They're playing us. Conservatives obviously completely give one fucking shit anyone rich. specific NYC area hospital system, taken mid crisis, unresolved cases time study.

Note also pre dexamethasone (iirc, study showed good benefits ventilator patients came couple months Northwell published ventilator mortality figures).

Being vent still bad sign, dire was. Sounds like town, unfortunately. would reason enough shop Home Depot. never cited snopes, cited quote directly Jacobson vs Massachusetts.  arguing bad faith.

I still seen scrap citation backing claim made. bad jar broke

As in, literal jar that's bad job break? Sorry bother, I'm fascinated cultural expressions like idea one. Washing hands part “old normal” Oh, ""lung infection"" ""pneumonia"" making half excess deaths around world right now. long countries making commercials Sarah Mclachlan saying ""Every 60 seconds American dies something government could prevented, help poor people?"" There’s reason ability sue company damages found liable court law. company appeal courts, plaintiffs. 

It’s perfect system means. disabling midst pandemic already FUBARed Feds — that’s handing like pussies.

And aren’t pussies 🇺🇸 None. shit expensive af. Hand washing? Yes. Distancing? No. can’t get people social distance year goes directly human nature. “Senate Dithers Rona Burns” Lowe's Home Depot share CEO. Employers never take proactive approach. take law stating huge (like 30k) fine payable half employee half state keeping known coronavirus positive employee work home, get employers stop making people work know person sick. Someone positive test proof worked within 14 days test date...fine kicks in. Someone offer work...but employer step say can't specified time.

The one exception asymptomatic healthcare worker volunteers continue work covid positive patients positive themself. (And get paid course) Meanwhile large grocery store chain work ended extra $2 hour end June whats mythical bonus speak of? know could producer supplier end right? supply chain many notches, affected virus reimbursed? Per capita infections per capita deaths. Specially realize difference population density two countries. comparison countries right suffering 2nd wave infections, Korean approach still stellar, night n day terms performance outcomes. major uncontrollable outbreaks.. Basketball much better baseball right now. Hope football get shit together time. BA DE YA!

SAY REMEMBER?! Depends everyone is. keep running people keep telling great new data trending. referring +2,000,000? can’t deaths. absolute catastrophic failing every turn probably wouldn’t tick us million. simply isn’t enough susceptible people country support many deaths. They're shitholes true lots industries. friend works beer liquor distributor said many breweries making 25% normal production staff either sick quarantined. track minimum 20 years? Fucker Carlson. given name. Massachusetts reported lost job insurance new free health care plan arrive mail. didn’t even ask it. course won’t get new job, tf knows be. ""I'm place""

You move moms basement one days son. said shutdown, lockdown.

And worked. “Meanwhile, investigation NPR noted irregularities process used Trump administration grant TeleTracking Technologies $10.2 million contract set federal database. particular, CEO Pittsburgh-based company links Trump Organization. Congressional investigators looking matter.” Cardinals/Brewers postponed due positive tests.

MLB continues fucking up. This. official count high, tip iceberg compared actual numbers. Dear disagree sweden significantly deaths compare swedish baseline last 5 years.

Yes, disagree. Also, opinion matter important, fact. Here's diagram total deaths/million month last 30 years Sweden: clearly see diagram, 2020 track around five-year average, ten-year average, way thirty-year average.

Yes, setback long-term trend declining mortality, actually pretty tiny setback grand scheme disagree sweden death compare nordic baseline?

Yes, disagree. Looking flu seasons, means count deaths week 40 last year now, Sweden amount deaths/million Denmark, Norway, less would love cumulative diagram Nordic countries like one above, best have. full-year comparisons, apples-to-apples comparison, include covid-19 deaths four countries.) One reckless act endangers people around him. calculated act endangers whole state.

So no. true. Although don’t see Home Depot (though haven’t looked hard...). maybe Lowe’s least marginally better? many people wearing masks even though mandated. fucking infuriating. hero deserve must sarcastic. Right, guys? ... Guys? giving 150 part time/summer workers 300 full time, paying taxes that's take home amount win case, yes.

However, get settlement... number daily also Saturday people working, I’d instead look graph next it. Never going work. 

Government stop current protests would u ever think shutting would stop them? u happen consider many protests would shutdown???

proofread, nat geo dunces. Wait learn cells. Yes, school Indiana starts early. Growing up, always started school 2nd week August, got late May. kids school still same. Coworkers child started yesterday due school ""underperforming"" state tests. Never thought early now. really terrible precedent set, even someone forgotten mask since march (fortunately paid pick-up dash out) vehemently pro-masks. intentionally spreading least seen mental help, prosecuting mask incompliance going help one (and worse, bolster ""mask beast""/NWO conspiracy theorists).

however, anti-mask politicians absolutely get boot lousy, pathetic leadership skills, absolutely. students (a 4 week vacation rest minimum mandatory requirement want student health put first). parents dont know put kids go work. ""Testing visitors impractical, health department local body officials decided subject 2100 people immediate contacts strict 14-day quarantine. ""

while agree face masks work, flaw missouri example. there, fraction patrons tested. example appears zero tested. less clickbait headline would read ""2,123 contacts 'not sick enough contact local health service' "" makes less money Aayyy lmao thought gonna school back home....dumbies Okay here's thing. Let's say hypothetically, schools open fall. someone gets Covid, whether teacher student, track everyone person interacted with, that's fairly large portion school, right? forced self quarantine 14 days, hell going catch back up, unless revert online learning? school like one went outdated underfunded, transitioning people online learning nearly impossible. So...how hell going work...? Numbers Russian doctors falling balcony much higher confirmed Covid19 cases. Putin iron grib killing Russians vien German science minister said late June expect vaccine (at all) ""this time next year"". virologists expect even get vaccine next year, expect ""super vaccine"" would allow us fully reopen return normal. (A even expect *never* happen, least within lifetimes.) Whatever say Shlomo. good point. Getting rid Trump like killing Hitler. sued 🤞  Can't go visit friends family, even adequately distanced garden. **Can** go office share indoor space dozens others 8+ hours. **Can** go shopping centres/pubs/restaurants.

Oh crap didn’t get far article. He's still one knocks! virus!

And test results back 1 2 days. sure entirely idiocy; there's certainly chance there's large number asymptomatic carriers running around population undetected.  jobs don’t force people 25 people unventilated room hours time. Obviously don’t care people die I’m sure you’re terrible person life I’d even guess don’t wear mask Karen well. Diplomats think Sweden's strategy worst, find unlikely Nordic countries catch numbers. Finland, example, much better prepared test/trace/isolate, IMO would take really bad luck (something like superspreader mass event indoors participants country) numbers go back even March-April, let alone become worse that.

The Nordic countries besides Sweden able beat first wave go back less normal life couple months even without full-on lockdowns mandatory masks, really see suddenly dropping ball badly they'd catch Sweden unless vaccine seriously delayed currently estimated.

Closing schools really brainer little political backlash and... effective. Come America, happens way less often! use guns so... restaurant survives. friend closed dream restaurant (French Bistro) due lack customers stay open.

He still small downtown restaurant open, says it’s bleeding money too. Forget cases, people argue ""better testing"" blue face.

Let's go deaths.

Most schools closed end March. March 31st 7 day daily death average 606. Today, 7 day daily death average 1057. Exactly. literally ability save lives they’d rather not. Welcome Indiana article:

On Aug. 21, full-time hourly associates receive $300 part-time seasonal associates receive $150. August bonuses match funds previously provided hourly associates March May well earlier month, company announced. US left Human Rights Council 2017 believe. brother works Lowe's according 2 weeks month stopped gave bail businesses. People afraid catching COVID 19 renters? Umm...Democrats help things either. “old world” dead Spanish flu? wish US gave money, tbh.

A lot countries exploit never opportunity prepare pandemic. course would patronizing name. Less fox news buddy Absolutely raise, total, minimum wage around. According BI's metrics north 19 bucks hour. basically pay people third need live sustainable life. make little $21 hour, single adult, get pretty tight. put away little month, much, save. fend one legendary $400 emergencies, maybe 2 year comfort. also take away inventing, saving, vacations etc, anything extra. 

Point being, 21ish hour live very, modest life, little chance taking real 2 week vacation, know, actually vacating. livable single adult, rough things pop up. $19 hour seems experience floor earnings. Rent cheap want live near humans cows, bills cheaper working poor, pay rates stuff like phones, electric, doctors on. live bare minimum spend little extra, much left someone really go out, pays dues clubs such, splurge much anything (my TV like 8-10 years old example). 

$19/hr plus needed want shot ""American Dream"". cant' save put 10% home, let alone 20% 21 hour. take 20 years put away 30 - 40K cash, that's without BS happening. Yup! work people leaving ever customers time high. wear masks ignore glass barricades registers. Actually averaging $300/month including hourly pay raise. It’s good money we’ve spent drunken Coronavirus spending binge. Imagine done PPE testing. half Norway’s new cases coming abroad despite somewhat restrictive criteria reopening, seems like bit mistake reopen borders. 

It’s really surprising 11% come Sweden, since Finns documented many new cases coming Sweden (which one highest burdens infection Europe [the developed European country WHO’s list risk countries]( ). surprising many cases came Kosovo Serbia either, sadly. 

What surprising worrying 16% came countries like Germany, Poland Denmark wherein infection burden relatively low, sadly increasing least DK DE (not sure Poland). It'll interesting see Norway's reaction is. tl;dr: They're middle income countries. -Amazon scurries away back shadows- honestly not. US choosing hedge bets one giving preorders allowing companies easily ramp production risk. Danish authorities attempted proclaim little science subject. 
The reasoning Denmark due low infection numbers, necessary facial coverings. 

With numbers rising steadily Denmark last weeks, tune change soon. shit, it’s business course aren’t goodness heart. little column A, little column B

Every garden &amp; home improvement store insanely busy.

I really appreciate said ""seem to"" instead making definitive statement. part solution! talking about? HIV coronavirus's completely different, also fastest mutating virus known man. regular flu vaccine also usually area 30-50% effective. front runner vaccines right Oxford one isnt even mRNA vaccine either. Lol really? never would guessed /s Yeah, Sweden failed protecting vulnerable/nursing home populations ways Norway didn't.

Online education isn’t what’s best pedagogically littles, stress anxiety person school, isn’t going worth risk kids, staff, community. Wait next quarter’s figures come out. one bad, wait see effects gutting everyone’s unemployment benefits top everything else. get seriously ill, plan declare bankruptcy medical debt. 

I work film production. decade restaurant work. Neither going work least next year. There’s ton people like absolutely fucked. maybe clothing stores get kick people size up.

I've bitching since Memorial Day weekend. Cases dropped dramatically Sweden too, without masks. Nordic countries spread control quite time now, without masks. use violence keep market functional. That’s primary goal. sounds like conspiracy governments primary role market property protection, that’s done via law enforcement Put em work! bars packed near lol reason masks downplayed insane hording mentality would short supply chain. Hospital workers running needed survive around infected people absolute certainty.  ordinary people low risk started hording masks, hospitals ran health care workers died. save grandmaa 😢😢😢😢😢 One death tragedy. million deaths statistic. honestly, rural voters anti mask well. They'll vote goons right back office, thank standing ""tyranny."" Thanks, FT much better source.

FT also shows Norway, much comparable country Sweden, even slightly better economic numbers despite totally different Covid Response far less deaths. kidding?

It's ""semantics,"" (which mis_using discounts point).

Most Americans enough money basics, much less savings like yours.

You're playing hand well, perhaps, everyone wins people like recognize dealt exceptionally great hand begin with.

20% American children malnourished. parents lazy ""irresponsible.""

You really learn actual world around pull muscle patting back unequal system benefit from. think realize important first 6 years education. much impact loosing 1 years worth education (school closed March). Ask teacher impact summer break child education. 

If wanna see impacts poor education person, look up: anti-vaxxxer anti-maskers. people get good education. 

But go school potentially get sick, bring home virus expose entire family. another outcome bad.

Like said horrible. kids suffer either way. *Florida Man: Growing North* Boom would think considering players making 10x field. still losing alot money playing. question would job $1,000,000 risk covid? Many players ask question. LOL asked question 7 minutes later without seen yours.

There might chance I'll unable post daily report next days due Hurricane Isaias. live side hitting, live Palm Beach County might case power outage might happen couple days. Again, decision set stone hopefully go way Icelandic one go ahead. 

""more cases"" low threshold Denmark right still, esp. compared high caseload Sweden. situation Denmark looks nothing like controlled burn, esp. compared one Sweden looks exactly like Tegnell literally said it. We've gotten extra pay one month, FOURTH $300 bonus. equals roughly $1500 full time associates. really pretty decent things considered. Underrated comment year. Tegnell even said might consider mask come fall. Sweden use Denmark control group since it’s country used comparison according Redditors. pretty much impossible stay constantly totally sensible mess, since real lack credible scientific research unified source credible information. loads articles research indicating things. They're enough people declare something definitely reddit, they're actual credible scientific research real question quote mined amateurs, leads misleading understanding research means.

The real question portion refers things like credible scientific research proving, mandating mask use actually beneficial? different asking: wearing mask protect people? second question largely technical easy test for, first one isn't. requires study actually happens everyone forced wear mask, compared social distancing limited mask use relied on. People use wrong masks, wear incorrectly, contaminate infect themselves, become confident protection provides, reducing use mitigation methods, on. end result may be, beneficial mandate mask use rely methods, benefits mask use apply certain situations, like social distancing option. questions credible scientific research point say, definitively one way another. Willful ignorance deadly. mean reason make much money shareholders try save costs every step business. say software engineer, Amazon notorious firing people working super long hours, pay nice. kidnap desantis, duct tape chair, force shut lol. that's way  said stop pretty much points camps debunked, claims go back people associated u.s secret service adrien zenz (not sure spelling). people pushing / believing got board Iraq WMD got u.s intervention ended killing 100k+ people destroying country reason. 

just showing people jail prove anything. 10-20k uyghurs went fight isis syria, many buddy left back home ? sure going jail choke full uyghurs main ethnic group zone bunch isis sympatisers needed jailing. CCP: ""trust us, lets wait awhile""

Also CCP: ""We're totally welding people apartments Wuhan"" John Bolton's book, trump told Xi phone approved they're Uighirs, many brows furrowed. Yes, US long hot spot opted controlling virus. this, right now, different terrifying ways. 

The difference outbreaks localized within states.

New York City. Seattle. New Orleans. state considered hot spot area within state hot spot. 

Now, outbreaks state level. many hot spots Louisiana travel across state, cannot avoid coming contact high risk encounters.

This what's new.

You cannot simply opt visiting hot spot everywhere. Jim Jordans aka Gym Jordans

Landlords prefer empty unit making $0 occupied unit making $0 general contractor business 13 years busiest ever crazy one near FL enforce mask policy customers. problem allowing virus reproduce mutate. Why, God's Earth, would want make America petri dish virus. kind sick thinking that. Oh yeah, sociopath thinking. infection rate 2.5, six times rate 15. 

If you’re sick, risk infecting 15 people every single time go somewhere. Visit three places one day risk infecting 45 people. 

Those 45 people could spread 675-2,025 people matter days. ...Who could spread 10,125-30,375 people matter days. 

This exactly strictly following public mitigation measures vital. Hehe ya sure ok

To fair, people still think shit joke part problem. Doubt get deadly, evolution works. Viruses want kill host. likely get less deadly contagious. Also dear leader proposing delaying election, Pelosi. shopping LOWE'S on. Jim Jordans low iq think people facetious. one really celebrating gunman actions. It’s funny violent crazy person probably effective leaders getting people take social distancing seriously. Absolutely, thank God got rid Bevin.

Why risk student's lives? Sheesh...Why behind ...I've wearing Google's since March...So called experts even know do. Yeah, opinion seems changing every week. federal level matter. None state state foolishness. State borders magically stop it. Going bat nationalists paints pretty clear picture are.

This think benefit. similar taking Zinc cold. much effective early shorten length cold drastic amount get full sick vs fighting early still sinuses reached lungs yet.

Zinc well established antiviral. cure get sick. Tamiflu works way. Somewhat effective early almost useless full blown sick (maybe shave day 12 day flu).

Remdesivir hand much serious side effects administered patient needs supplemental oxygen.

Seems like good combination therapy early later stages (in addition Zinc, C, D. Corticosteroids well late stage limit cytokine storm inflammation). fair hard rest us. speaking English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, even Russian German, could managed Europeans. Chinese? Even “experts” China cannot seem bother learning language... Good thing vaccine drug. Apply backdated unemployment even though cover moment called back. free money, plus extra $600 week federal benefits. available work unable work COVID-related reason, that's literally takes filling forms.

Let us hope several vaccines successful, world fractured there's one vaccine half world get it.  Friend done. 2 weeks get results anything talked far? Exactly Wow actual answer serious question !! lames want downvote question !! best data, greatest data world. winning data. go Yup, Republicans. can't ignore politics behind discuss ""millions lose financial lifeline"" even became thing without it. say generous, let's aid expiring, White House offered short-term extension Thursday $600 weekly unemployment benefit helped keep families economy afloat COVID-19 pandemic, Democrats rejected it, saying President Donald Trump’s team failed grasp severity crisis.

So long short-term another signal Republicans willing yield $600 jobless benefit, Arizona Republican Martha McSally, facing tough reelection race fall, offered one-week extension benefit Senate floor.

... one week keep playing politics? Political chump much? McSally grasp severity crisis? What's point reprieve? would Republicans capable week capable now? Ok fine, let's say long, things kicked road? playing hardball stark differences remain $3 trillion proposal Democrats $1 trillion counter Republicans.

Oh good God, utterly unrelated pandemic 10% GDP drop happened $600 unemployment benefit. dare notice people starving, another thread discussing two days ago! Guess addressing lack food could wait week longer. Yeah, need get dirty issues, kick week road leverage something nonissue ""government work.""

Oh wait, negotiating close deadline going recesses could discussed, amended, voted bill back May? exactly things we're right now? Oh right, Republicans. **urgency** completely unnecessary yet manufactured them. taxes fund development, get given vaccine cost right? definition flattening curve: 

""The number people may get sick, infections happen longer span time, hospitals treat everyone.""

As long hospitals overwhelmed, virus is, definition, control: anyone catches find treatment. really interested summer 2021 look. hope normality then? Show evidence Right, Sweden's economy well comparison neighbors actually locked countries long enough get infection rate control. almost like consumer confidence inversely related increase infection rate consequently deaths. 

Wow, would thought inverse relationship predicted historical examples documented epidemiological science. Much like social behaviour also changes relation social awareness pandemic, case numbers subsequently go down, also predicted epidemiological models.

But, nope, epidemiologists exaggerating pandemic. Clearly, common sense trumps science. Open economy despite 32% dip GDP since May. /sarcasm ""the analysis also suggested larger effectiveness hydroxychloroquine patients less severe COVID-19 disease interaction p-value&lt;.0001)"".

The #1 goal flattening curve avoid overwhelming hospitals prevent happened Wuhan Bergamo February. Every country, today, succeeded may seen graph social media called ""flattening curve."" graph shows tall, narrow curve short, wide curve. graph line shows many sick people U.S. hospitals treat.

The tall curve goes line. means many people sick one time: enough hospital beds people need treatment. flatter curve shows happens spread virus slows down.

The number people may get sick, infections happen longer span time, hospitals treat everyone.""

As today, July 31, hospital world overwhelmed way Wuhan Bergamo's hospitals overwhelmed February.

The hysteria took place Sweden today, none hospitals overwhelmed despite fact never locked down.

Yes, longer possible halt virus' progress. guess what? Halting virus never goal lockdowns, really know got idea from. Care cite source?

The point lockdowns always slow spread (in succeeded), halt virus altogether. Flattening curve means everyone infected, time.

Here, I'll quote again: ""The number people may get sick, infections happen longer span time, hospitals treat everyone.""

Finally, yes, vaccine way eliminate virus. doubt (although quite suspicious Sweden reporting all-time low number cases deaths, maybe virus weakened there?).

But, said before, point lockdowns flatten curve allow everyone infected time, wait time vaccine distributed everyone.  live someone get shots allergies cough pretty unusual. think cough kind enough stay away indoor public events. common sense really understanding difference 200% 2000%

Given average NFL career approximately 3-years maybe 4, players never see second tier $705k, let alone $915k league minimum. seems like it’s tests Omni entire county. article little vague mentions 25k tests done county. it’s one company would account roughly 1/3 Brevards total tests. past days county reported 6-8%

Edited spelling Exactly. 


You decent reading comprehension quick learner. 


You must one leaders conservatives. Good advice, thanks Premiums going skyrocket means fewer fewer Americans going health insurance.

That's really gist article. says ""access to"" insurance probably accurate say ""can't afford"" insurance. ACA's mandate 80-85% MLRs major medical insurance, increase insurance cost reflects increases cost care. COVID driving cost care, therefore health insurance become expensive. absurd years, perhaps easily contextualized saying ""healthcare costs housing.""  

[17.7% US GDP spent healthcare US GDP spent housing ready ""mortgages"" fund healthcare... home depot? Congress underwrite GoFundMe universal health care 😣 interested seeing works! I've asked source got lousy tweet dont hold breath. like saying White House (and current idiotic occupant) failed provide leadership coordinate unified approach. That's really good way raise revenue trying times devastated local budgets Yeah I've honestly pretty impressed company's monetary response employees. actually matter. cant afford $5,000 pocket insurance, insurance irrelevant. 5 grand 50 grand makes difference, unaffordable, youll never pay either way. 

So breaking bank forgoing mortgage putting food stomach pay COBRA kind absolutely fucking pointless. Don’t make assumption voting public large supports initiatives younger intelligent voters do. That’s drawback democracy, it’s courts often agents change comes civil rights. boomers prevent common sense proposals becoming reality, unfortunately representative political process take account  goal always suppress number cases healthcare wouldn´t overwhelmed. Lockdown extreme, costly effective case achieve that. best testing, everybody says so, tremendous, ask anyone, best I’m sure easy... 2 weeks lockdown one would die easy peasy! disrespectful comment downplay severity disease disrespect fighting nurses doctors, acting better everyone else **The largest increase number corona infections Denmark single day since May 18th.** yet Danish government plans remove restrictions open even more.

Yes, many people making partial payments make sense evict them. However make sense evict anyone paying $0. don’t know answer, probably not. I’m sure ones experiencing symptoms contact confirmed case getting tested, like adults. Young kids seem mildly symptomatic asymptomatic higher rate older people, may getting tested much. million dollar question transmitting spreading virus easily older people. APPEARS not, that’s strictly based apparent lack outbreaks (under 5) daycares across world open whole time. viruses (cold, flu, stomach bug) seem spread daycare settings like wildfire. We’re seeing covid reason, including confirmed child teacher transmission date.

I’m making claim one way another, I’m looking available data information making hypothesis. current data seems promising young ones terms ability infect transmit. dont know nurses hospital personnel thank service. dont means directly support front line healthcare workers right now, want know mine hold lot highest regard. one martyred will. know sometimes, thanks somewhat empty, especially faced lack support direct superiors governing bodies, wont let stop expressing infinitely thankful every single nurse, doctor, hospital staffer, EMT, dispatch officer, healthcare worker cant think moment. wish everyone could selfless are. take “well isn’t much” take negativity elsewhere. Nothing ever good enough people smh. question thought endgame implementing lockdown was. said think get active cases manageable level mitigation strategies effectively applied prevent hospital overwhelm catastrophic amounts covid-related death. reduce active cases manageable level fail implement effective mitigation strategies, yes runaway acceleration case number occur. me, allowing packed beaches clubbing Ibiza effective mitigation strategies, binary ending global interstate tourism. viruses disappeared, plenty viruses made asterisk history books. point figure one vaccine, world either vaccinated choose mask/distance longer massive, hospital crushing outbreaks. hope. Clay next level stupid entire thing yet Providence healthcare system doesn’t even shell anything employees working hospital pandemic. current strategy. working.  Thank much going want wear mask. rational most.  Well good thing Pelosi said trumps $600 dollar week extension right? Really showed people america there! 

Edit: Good thing keep trying slip SALT tax repeal well, really helps people worried getting evicted! one deathly illness add misery short long lives. wonder there's life death. Florida making much easier headline writers -- copy paste yesterday's headline change couple numbers. /s states those? None really ever closed weeks. I’m one ones downvoted you, what’s wrong 1 1 speech therapy? classroom next six months?

I’d much rather son speech delays damaged heart lungs.  Crazy. Thursdays always peak day Fridays 20% less Thursday number. Instead Friday get increase Thursdays numbers. Disney still open?  Ehhhhh really. trying back mom dude 'won' her. Lois show control freak. Staying dorm him? Really? trying justify shit like that? surprised Pikachu face every time kids act shit like that. Many school districts thousands students per grade. district, even largest city, 13 elementary schools alone (K-5). Usually people post throwaways comment like ""I slept neighbors husband dog"". you, hero. debating controversial lumber futures market. Real American Hero. Oh yah, would normally. definitely bother sitting table alone. day though nice day sit outside people watch pint. Perhaps, since career span usually cut short due injury... sitting may detrimental. states problems locked 4 months. effectively went full reopening May June; bars open state absolutely locked down. What's going non-compliance - allowed current rules often even encouraged leadership. medical credentials exactly, founding Gates Foundation?

If Elon others called lack education, Gates get pass funds organization? Good catch, thank you. Lol personal experience, it’s exact opposite. I’m sure varies location personal taste. fucking hate police. Agree! Florida data sudden started go flat yet hospitals miami overflow. Everything open well. work hospital cut annual raises stopped matching retirement accounts saw chance save money..... would happy hazard pay part it.  Absolutely. another redditor sub said, like putting kids experiment research question is, ""If pour water onto piece paper, get wet?"" asking, ""If paper red, still get wet?""

This major concern since university closed March- massive influx students, majority take least one in-person class approximately 3 hours per week (some 3-hour long lectures, like myself, online option), stupid assume going outbreaks? Especially state- Texas. 

Universities getting amount facetime 'open schools' debate should. pure magical thinking believe we'll get relatively unscathed, students right thing. dorms even open, ffs.

Edit: word here. Months back chest heart pain taking deep breaths. Hurt bad thought maybe hard attack. Didn’t symptoms didn’t think much passed time later. read article think damn maybe...my heart messed up. Whereas, RI zero deaths 😷

Mississippians: Social distancing (stay 6+ feet apart). house parties. gatherings. Close bars, dine-in restaurants, gyms, schools. Wear mask, covering nose mouth. Wash hands often. Safety goggles *must* somewhere can’t social distance. Stay home except outings required sustain life.

Good luck 🍀 Office workers - employers planning open office?

I’m appalled department VP wants us back office (in California) October. anyone else crazy company trying bring back early? Makes wonder US government shitty response COVID purpose We've one, yes. SECOND seconds? pathetic many people live boring lives cannot entertain themselves. Strike quit honestly, get anywhere else Munbind=face mask, sanitary napkin work OG, far tell use delivery services except own.

People straight tipping now. We'll get huge parties come end leaving 1 2$, stiff waiter/waitress. 

Our tipping system weird though, like To-Go people pool tips get spread evenly among To-Go people bartender. bartenders get keep tips either, go pool.

Same thing servers bussers, except they're pool system. sports well likely TV (basketball, hockey). others done little planning likely cancelled (baseball, football). Las Vegas, Texas long gone.  Guess run city names gotta borrow others. *looking Paris, TX* I'm midwesterner safe anyone. friends. Believe not, we're dumbasses. awesome. Maybe check working there....all ""essential"" job done cut hours made overtime non existent. :( It’s called conversation. asked question, answered it, asked another.

You don’t want answer them, perhaps know leads.

Most people aren’t making basic necessities life. That’s true. don’t make them, won’t them. unacceptable every way every level. absolutely zero reason anyone risking lives. many hundreds thousands people going die finally clicks heads doing!?... wish little digging Ars part. believe owner Trump donor. 

[NPR detail really huge red firm given Trump Foundation.

That required vaccine massive global ever combat disease. demonstrated can’t. left? Again, stated repeatedly measures Information article repealed yet likely be. reopening DK done carefully phases one measure seemed lead increase, measure could tightened again. exactly happened Iceland recently, too, probably also happen Denmark.


Going 15ish cases per day around 40-60 great, nope, cause panic overall terms. 

It's Sweden worse makes DK starting slip ok, Sweden worse worse problem region (and Sweden). helps put problems perspective Denmark slight compared huge troubles sadly ongoing Sweden. follow guidelines reasonable. no. Make data fit agenda tend recommend buying surgical masks tossing go. COVID may decay, still build bacteria, etc. Let's pretend mask that's used full day smells good fresh one box. sanitary reasons, people toss job uses masks PPE (not even hospitals).

Surgical-style disposable masks pretty widely available stores. means nothing actually claiming ""mask compliance"" one actually using Sweden. commented anything else interpretation, masks used Sweden fact accept. understand haha. I’m saying. bar essentially community table right? People would rather sit join conversation respective tables would seem. Maybe I’m familiar bar haunts may one unspoken consensus among frequent bars sit, company, bar strangers. ""Gee, wonder would happen tried put fire gasoline"" disabled person, receive less full-time, minimum-wage employees make month.
Does mean need less? No.
Do unemployed people need less do, education skills take different( lower cost-of-living) state move?

I’m saying, people unemployed various reasons COVID made worse.

You can’t say one unemployed person “deserves” less money receive.

Or can, think that’s livable-wage issue hey-no-fair! issue.

If system worked right, nobody would say unemployment “pays” better job...any job.

That’s yet another screwed-up part system add pile. Obviously mask wearing *some* social distancing continue fully effective vaccine. assuming somewhat effective vaccine released fall, think we'll able return almost-normal ""do everything used masks on"" mid winter/spring?

I want know whether possible return campus next spring last semester (currently fully online fall) realistic best case scenario vaccine deployment. others wear masks? Except seems appearing even mild cases, recall people needing heart MRIs flu chickwn pox whatever. Certainly hear odd case again, like freind mine strep throat femur semi chronic condition, normally. Dr. Phil quote. said 360,000 people die swimming pools year. number actually people say saying years already tracked nothing private. asked guy office stuff telling years lie different wad already happening. Blank stare. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS prospective observational cohort study, 100
patients recently recovered COVID-19 illness identified University
Hospital Frankfurt COVID-19 Registry April June 2020.

EXPOSURE Recent recovery severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection,
as determined reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction swab test upper
respiratory tract.

MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, and
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging obtained. Comparisons made
with age-matched sex-matched control groups healthy volunteers (n = 50) risk
factor–matched patients (n = 57).

RESULTS 100 included patients, 53 (53%) male, median (interquartile
range [IQR]) age 49 (45-53) years. median (IQR) time interval COVID-19
diagnosis CMR 71 (64-92) days. 100 patients recently recovered from
COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered home, 33 (33%) required hospitalization. time
of CMR, high-sensitivity troponin (hsTnT) detectable (3 pg/mL greater) 71 patients
recently recovered COVID-19 (71%) significantly elevated (13.9 pg/mL greater) in
5 patients (5%). Compared healthy controls risk factor–matched controls, patients
recently recovered COVID-19 lower left ventricular ejection fraction, higher left
ventricle volumes, higher left ventricle mass, raised native T1 T2. total 78
patients recently recovered COVID-19 (78%) abnormal CMR findings, including
raised myocardial native T1 (n = 73), raised myocardial native T2 (n = 60), myocardial late
gadolinium enhancement (n = 32), pericardial enhancement (n = 22). small
but significant difference patients recovered home vs hospital for
native T1 mapping (median [IQR], 1122 [1113-1132] ms vs 1143 [1131-1156] ms; P = .02) not
for native T2 mapping hsTnT levels. None measures correlated time
from COVID-19 diagnosis (native T1: r = 0.07; P = .47; native T2: r = 0.14; P = .15; hsTnT:
r = −0.07; P = .50). High-sensitivity troponin significantly correlated native T1
mapping (r = 0.35; P &lt; .001) native T2 mapping (r = 0.22; P = .03). Endomyocardial
biopsy patients severe findings revealed active lymphocytic inflammation. Native T1
and T2 measures best discriminatory ability detect COVID-19–related
myocardial pathology.

CONCLUSIONS RELEVANCE study cohort German patients recently
recovered COVID-19 infection, CMR revealed cardiac involvement 78 patients (78%)
and ongoing myocardial inflammation 60 patients (60%), independent preexisting
conditions, severity overall course acute illness, time original

Everyone's entitled opinion encryption debate, neither people ""shady fuck"" it. shady spy people? Yes. shady crime encypted channels, also yes. discussion shady, especially since like say it, control communication platform. don’t mods take down? 🤔 population 3m.... they've promoting domestic tourism, country still open international tourism. last saw exception non-resident entry 250 business related entries per day, restricted handful countries Australia, New Zealand, Thailand Vietnam. entering need get tested upon arrival, quarantine receiving negative result even choice. government get ass provide people proper protections endure lockdown however long need to. going bring income dead?

In contrast, Hong Kong, basic law owned CCP. CCP freedom explain modify it. one new(er) polar class expedition 4% many, people voluntarily social distanced, wore masks, etc.

Lol they’ll never receiving me. Feels good scam pos company. month in? Would make sense test test soon after? Might make sense schedule tests row. There's quite community test sites live would suspected infection, could viewed wasteful here. Really, smells like bullshit. 3 triplets get vaccine like 1 person get vaccine trial. That's ineffective. think 3 kids different times rather once?

/s 65,000 people confirmed Covid every day. real number several times higher asymptomatic mild cases, mention turnaround time tests. Good luck contact tracing many! might want look bill gates actually done time past 15 years so.

I'll give hint, windows. first month two. anymore, that’s sure. minimum wage now. Agreed. favorite part though Fauci seemed enough decided give guy answer...outside crowds less risk inside crowds, however, large crowds people wearing masks risk. 

Not answer guy hoping for, I’m guessing. Kind common shut sites, past month number city county testing sites around country done due heat. serve (coronavirus citizens) protect (who exactly?) protected liability bullshit pulled republicans. Home Depot contributes Republicans company, Lowes supports Democrats, pays better overall company work support. Many ≠ **literally** think simulation

At 12:23 world simulation find way cheat make everything better? 

**Elon:** simulation, indistinguishable reality. strive make future people look forward to. Expand scope consciousness, explore universe, try understand better, figure right questions ask... ignorant happens maybe Seattle Mariners win all! Why? wear mask, person giving wears mask, stick needle arm 5 seconds go home. Bonus plexiglass shield window big enough stick hand needle through. Less interaction checking grocery store honest. Thoughts disposable vs reusable masks?

I know former environmentally friendly look across Asia, used practically everywhere standard mask people wear. benefits come mind:

* sanitary: throw one everyday least often dirtier environment. Even though COVID virus die time reusable mask, still build soil, bacteria, grease, etc cloth mask that's favorable.
* Better filtration: Take properly made melt blown mask 3 layers. melt blown layer filters better cloth mask fabrics.
* Better protection: 3 layer mask mentioned hold water without leaking. cloth mask?

I know cloth mask better mask, parts US comfortable wearing masks already, personally think better idea switch disposable masks. They're easily available many stores box car make convenient go out. equivalent 355 deaths yes situation actually worse pretty crazy. goes doubly ""God"". I’m moving goalposts all.

Some people work home. people make basic necessities life cannot. makes weary baseball teams endless resources protocols can’t keep virus bay...how schools supposed prevent outbreaks? Well idiots see, idiots don’t tend make intelligent decisions idiotic ones.. literally fucking take test anyways even tell 5-8 days.

Using long excuse take fucking stupid. 80% deaths Canada nursing home

Again, shutdowns cases weekly averages last seen March.  Toronto going stage 3 opening today.  perspective, Texas Florida pretty well stayed Stage 4, last phase, whole time.

The place work everyone layoff back work now. GFs work never laid anyone everyone working remotely. work multi billion dollar organizations.

Just old, mean care them. sacrifice people money. 

It one other. Proper behaviors, absolutely simple ones like masks, social distancing etc lead success.

You comment saying going make point take mask soon got past door wherever going. THATS HALFASS LOCKDOWN BUD, YOURE PART PROBLEM

I grocery store morning here, 100% mask compliance, probably 120 people store. One guy pulled nose, guy got stares fucking pulled back up. Human beings respond social pressure.

My area 1.1 million people. 0 cases multiple days week. again, never anyone speak Conservative Liberal, one cares terms COVID Even furloughed, still able keep plan unless making contributions.

Don't get wrong, furloughed means unexpectedly enough money, always shitty. health insurance job, still contributions made, still better paying full price hospital bills. pretty uncomfortable popular ""8th world"" way correct basically saying ""Sweden much better statistics countries"". Really coming brat looking everyone even though kinda true. Sweden's government obsessive statistics everything even pandemic. also obsessive completely correct without even slightest oversight. really voluntary masking *in conjunction with* voluntary safety measures. 

And still landed country really bad place.

But think research say one engaged voluntary safety measures, country would worse off. one study, 100 randomly selected patients who'd recovered COVID-19 underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging median 71 days testing positive SARS-CoV-2. time MRI, roughly 20% reported atypical chest pain palpitations, one third said ongoing shortness breath. Overall, 78% abnormal MRI findings, **regardless preexisting conditions, COVID-19 severity, cardiac symptoms**. particular, 60% showed cardiac inflammation.

Edit: bolding added thought virtual bubble fool proof? Virtual! Bubble! idiotic idea, letting players wander free recognizance large scale community spread across many states. entire season depends upon lowest common denominator player. know mask less virus hoaxers, MLB players. think going assiduously follow public health team guidelines? cant really sports outside bubble right now. Yeah, say, worked Amazon quite 10 years ago, stocks gave us. realize ended. blows.

My bonuses would spent long gone. 9 12 shares though... lol.  current company fulfillment profit sharing FT employees. try harder make numbers know profit aiming benefits well. 

It seems Amazon profitable share profits employees give bonuses ANYONE, like EVER. People got dicked stocks time.  They'd bait people bonuses hours worked, yank leaving minute early one days. instead cash, give ""fun prizes"" like ""Amazon bucks"" spend vending machine.

$4B last quarter? AFAIC, everything machines fucking free. Again, similar company rn, fill fridge drinks snacks us, buy us meals twice week.  time, incentives, instead raises.  Yes, got hourly raise essential, ended May 31st. get bonuses. June 1st, covid/hardship raise became permanent. great suggestions. Make sure stay hydrated well. Watch unusual symptoms feeling off. onset symptoms mild &amp; could easily overlooked.

Good luck! Really rooting teachers there. Ya know freakin sucks right I’ll happy spring Yes, looks like Oxford vaccine may prevent disease, infection (meaning still spread it), concept think many people grasp. think many people also think immune second injected understand weeks takes build immunity June 17–20, overnight camp Georgia (camp A) held orientation 138 trainees 120 staff members; staff members remained first camp session, scheduled June 21–27, joined 363 campers three senior staff members June 21. . . . total 597 Georgia residents attended camp A. Median camper age 12 years (range = 6–19 years), 53% (182 346) female. median age staff members trainees 17 years (range = 14–59 years), 59% (148 251) female. ***Test results available 344 (58%) attendees; among these, 260 (76%) positive.*** overall attack rate 44% (260 597), 51% among aged 6–10 years, 44% among aged 11–17 years, 33% among aged 18–21 years Good do, less worry propitiating racist ideology.  isn’t snarky comment I’m genuinely curious. Isn’t Bill Gates boat Elon? beliefs. isn’t Bill Gates guy Microsoft made way world computers??? think he’s authority Coronavirus? background virology I’m missing?

Couldn’t Elon like “Stick computers charities.” ? get cancer, likely die. get COVID, likely live.

If cancer infectious yes, people panic. extreme. cancer extremely lethal all. opposed COVID CFR 1%. Yeah “hurricane” deaths go roof. realize redesckey much Bible supposed figurative, literal.

I know, that's point. reply wrong comment? You’d think playoffs bubble, especially first round (if even get far) Cases fell cliff early July, gentle downward trend. almost exactly two weeks schools closed people started taking holiday (main holiday July, go June August). Elon Musk engineer, yet fanboys jizz every time talks rockets cars. ROFL can't wait sit family Christmas watch Game 7 World Series. 

/just kidding like Game 2 ALDS. I’ve seen many people commenting apps like government use spy them.... one already using smartphone track you. That’s get traffic conditions google maps. Secondly interesting think lives government wants see doing? you’re breaking law hide?! right buy whatever numbers White House releases. tell COVID-19 longer issue, they'll believe even dying hospital bed ventilator throats. We've already seen Herman Cain absolutely willing die stupid ass hill. don’t know many deaths COVID number tracked. tracked deaths COVID, includes anyone dies cause COVID positive test COVID flu like symptoms. great stopped going local Lowe’s employees wearing masks properly (noses hanging around chin) aggressively getting personal space even backing away. worst store experienced since pandemic. go back even pandemic ends. Taxes bonuses *withheld* 40%. get difference 40% normal marginal tax rate back file taxes end year. Mondays gonna blood bath. Damn Karen! look overall mortality, C-19 deaths, Sweden didn’t nearly badly far appears looking C-19 data. back within normal mortality range much rest world seeing case numbers go back up, strategy may prove less deadly overall long run. Agree job deems essential give supplemental hazard pay employees. many workers completely screwed right now. need higher pay period bonus like people who've unemployment got would least something. Lol, 


You claim people wore masks. provided source saying 4% wore mask. refer sources provided (4%) claim people wear mask. 


You funny. That's sad hear. hospital? Okay. one issue important lives hundreds thousands people, lives children? we’ll likely lose start person schooling vaccine arrives.

They’re talking fall 2020 winter 2021 vaccine. That’s short time things considered. Vietnam's CDC morning July 31st, among COVID-19 patients treated, following patients severe progression, severe prognosis, high risk death: BN416, BN418, BN431, BN436, BN437, BN438 ... 

In addition, patients progressed worse BN429, BN426, BN427, BN430, BN422, BN433 ... severe patients problem elderly, many underlying diseases.

Information press end morning July 31st, Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son, Deputy Minister Health said, infected COVID-19, group people high risk aggravation focus group people. elderly (over 60 years old), underlying medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney failure, dialysis, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary ...) atopic, obese, impaired masterpiece ...

""These factors easily lead risk aggravation infected COVID-19"" - Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

Analyzing specifically mechanism aggravation, Deputy Minister Health Nguyen Truong Son said group mentioned COVID-19 reduce resistance, making virus grow body faster, Organ damage faster patients.

""I aware risk cytokine storm. people attacked virus activate body's immune system. system attacks virus also attacks internal organs, causing impairment."" organs reduced functions, leading severe illness, patient 91 Ho Chi Minh City previous period ""- Assoc. Prof. Dr. Nguyen Truong Son said.

During period, Treatment Sub-committee clearly record number patients experiencing ""cytokine storm"", however, according Deputy Minister Health, number patients showed signs, although changes signs organ failure well life threatening.

During period, COVID-19 patients chronic disease use respiratory support ECMO, mechanical ventilation, oxygen ...

 
""This dangerous sign, patients general patients chronic renal failure particular suffer disease, also accompanied serious diseases diabetes, heart failure, increased blood pressure ... virus attacks, organs vulnerable, resistance decreases much ""- Deputy Minister Nguyen Truong Son said.

An expert geriatrics said resistance elderly, suffering underlying diseases often lower age groups. elderly ill, COVID-19 cause chronic diseases progress acute exacerbation, patients likely die.

In fact, countries large number people infected dying, proportion COVID-19 patients die mainly elderly people many chronic diseases. Lmao I'm basing demographics culture, I'm basing expressed beliefs origins humanity! That's historical scientific question, someone believes answer essentially ""magic"", tells capacity reason poor. Work reading comprehension.

If doctor told believed Zeus cause thunder lightning ancient people said - would still trust ability evaluate evidence? No, would absurd. belief modern religion different evidence based. I'd saddened, surprised. would say so, simply directly allocated stupendous resources. agree trolls problem. say bullshit death projections mean? mean people think we’re undercounting deaths? hard time believing people trolls. 2/3 extended family actually talk irl stuff complaining about. isn’t internet thing. two separate realities thing. Ohio probably one best states handle this. Dewine huge reason ncaa tournament got work factory makes expensive paint. produced one small batch hand sanitizer gave local first responders, allowed stay open. prove could make essential supplies, would continue to. bullshit.

That's less thing everywhere. girlfriends dad owns manufacturing plant south africa able thing (he stayed mostly closed first lockdown, they're second lockdown pay bills somehow).

Who experts? week Trump moved data sent hospitals NDC Washington instead strangely graph started flatten. Odd that. true. needs fixed. Ah! Thanks clarification. guess following specifics closely should. 

Still - tourism right *bad* idea. still trust Japan get back control, spike need happen. Fingers crossed government again. also got caught price Pretty sure Bill zero Windows 10 control = hospitals overwhelmed. 

The virus control 100% world moment. Saying otherwise basically going entire objective flattening curve.  add comment, season gets closer, big names starting opt out. Chiefs lost starting running back almost Super Bowl MVP last year. teams like Patriots lost almost entire line. next couple weeks interesting say least Danish, like rest Sweden's neighbors, easily see Sweden's propagandistic denials herd immunity strategy due [statements Swedish officials saying actions taken proving is.

Many right factions many countries approve Sweden's herd immunity policies, Denmark. US Fox News, example, routinely touts Sweden model follow. unsurprising right factions DK also same. Sweden's herd immunity strat become cause celeb anti-lockdown crowd generally, seems broad support among pro.business right people west, including Denmark. Overpaid tax dollars. seasonal employee Lowe's years ago. new psych meds made quasi-judicial check psych ward week, bat eye. Even though practically started. took schedule week put right back got out. HR manager actually gave hug wished luck.

One employees gay one ever gave hard time. Honestly worry would survived medeival times, mask, complain haloween soon protect people dying becomes problem? 

I can't. universities going hot zones. Even right summer classes session, multiple campuses across country dealing outbreaks, primarily attributed partying Greek houses. impossible ask teens/20-somethings stop socializing, time attending in-person classes together sharing dorms/apartments. afford it, try get 1-bedroom far away campus, step foot buildings classes. going assume half students asymptomatic carriers. That’s myth. usually taxed whatever normal rate usually get always minimum 22%(i think?). different withholding rates. 


In end it’s based marginal tax rate. may get refund may pay. bite make bad person.

Unless literally something make positive changes, due desensitized, don't.

If taking every precaution already, yeah big deal, **don't** get desensitized, probably going early death due stress. Can't beat something can't change. Yeah. mean, people wear masks support lockdown.

It's really easy contract virus choose homelessness employment. Bill Gates philanthropist, he’s Dr. may able contribute money, spearhead research provide leadership foundation he’s reproach. mobility data shows Sweden one lightest “lockdowns” western  teacher. think whole “omg thx do!!!” stuff largely BS. Especially people vote tax raises would benefit us. 

It’s vocal minority don’t value teachers. It’s majority. business work paying tax money pay you,

Isn't money pay business expense, like rent supplies? business deduction? operating vulnerable communities though. fishing lodge completely avoiding Haida territory flying Prince Rupert.  


All Haida infected gotten infected traveling locations BC bringing back communities. find funny, least US currency tested stand things like washing machines various stresses. US money closer fabric paper made of. I'm also sure people forgotten random bills pockets washed them, coming fine. see information taken hard many people. hurts wrong time doesn’t it.  Cant fix stupid. Never shopping Home depot again, I've loving I'm seeing lowes ethically response BLM, pandemic, etc. Good news. continue go Lowe's instead Home Depot (when choice). pretty sure goal yep. Even company pays much health care. $7,000 deductible per person (for me, kid, kid).  fyi, means pay first $7k pocket matter what.  insurance kick covers 80% pay 20%.  

I ""out pocket maximum"" $14k never pay plan year, deductible resets every June 1.  

So actually happened me, medical bills hit maximum (i.e. paid 14k pocket) May, June 1 came along everything reset 7k deductible AGAIN, hit 14k maximum June. 28k pocket, health insurance costs 20k per year.

And someone great job ""great"" super expensive health care insurance.

The USA real country fixes health care.

*I want persons comment (deleted) stay ridiculous base is.* 

That one solid spin, great headline read I've ever seen one. ""allow"" sue you, blocks employee suing company. go ropes course sign waiver saying cannot sue company, fall break something there, cannot sue company getting hurt, sue breaking equipment would like (it would stupid costly could it). law written says company sue me, isnt law says cant, that's america works case know.

And really, slave? Im sorry, manager coming house, pulling whipping go make shoes? age BLM relearning history even (a conservative) know incredibly disingenuous think employer might fire going work equates slave.

And ""you sued working"" coming from, see anywhere bill, would ever hold court, judge even hear case much less would someone lose it, especially 20 million unemployed workers. would argue replaceable, likely true.

Some doctors hospitals playing.

Some hospitals understanding. Kinda like championed increased minimum wage $15/hour media failed mention took away VCP stock options (Which valued $3000)

Yeah, wage increase de-incentivized hard work warehouses VCP went away. FIL puts it, bums got paid more, took $2,000/year paycut.

Unfortunately FIL, financially intelligent. simply turned stock options every year. asked weeks ago see stocks would've worth kept keep start. warned probably want know.

Over nine years (EOY 2009 2017) immediately cashed 2k yearly stocks, pocketed 18k. value stocks (at 3k/share)... ~ $175k. current time, turns stock options worth nearly much half actual wage+other bonuses (175k vs. 360k) nine years.

Canada screwing around. love hockey, love reducing covid transmissions. agree supporting circumstantial evidence.  also quite possible we're seeing delayed hospitalizations deaths spike infections. 

Remember hospitalizations lag behind infections: takes symptoms show someone sick enough need hospitalization. Deaths lag even behind infections, there's often quite long lag death gets ""officially"" counted. 

The usual sequence events is: 

Infected Infectious symptoms yet Symptomatic Gets tested positive result Hospitalized Dead

Some people tested they're symptomatic due close contact known case, people getting tested symptoms manifest... takes days test results come back. 3-5 days common, people reporting delays 15 days get test results. don’t say? Florida number new cases week now. Probably happen players one relatives. someone's mama dies, MLB real shit show hands America joke country Well foundation lot work healthcare sector, probably experience field, even bit indirect doctors biologists/virologists.

Kåre Mølbaek specifically said ""Hammer Dance"" strat play. 

Sweden's ""recovery"" still burden infection far worse levels Denmark ever had. recent outbreak DK centered around meatpacking plant, notorious encouraging large spread also shown containable. 

Sure, concerned recent development Denmark. Sweden 5x cases today DK 4x deaths, clear country need concern. One needs keep perspective. No, read Reppublica — center-left Italian newspaper — summarize new cases identified every day. Italy good job reporting this. Hundreds cases found migrant reception center Veneto. isn’t racism — it’s stating reality. Thankfully, they’ll well looked center. raging epidemics Libya many migrants set Italy from. higher Almost need shut stop spread... Wait dogs get covid? Agreed...if figure way cure large percentage cases prob get back normal quickly curious many people working home point view many people point view actually working person themselves. seems nonsense mainly comes folks privilege income safety homes Even every country took China's approach today weld doors people leave houses, would still see plenty COVID cases quarantine over.

This another risk factor months recovery however - it'll take longer many people bounce fully back typically would less virulent infections. Exactly.

(Not source says 4%) There's lot bad reporting immunity. Antibodies always wane infection resolves. body usually generates memory cells able quickly start making new antibodies upon re-exposure virus.

So losing antibodies expected mean loss immunity. country Provide free medical care? free education, mean higher education?

I incredibly grateful relatively mild pandemic. (don't want underplay compared could be...).

There must incredibly much learn say pretty ill prepared (at least part woods) understatement. students. Teachers options making classes online, online options class need tough shit. number deaths reported past 24 hours record, yes. 257, 253 day before. seen already, watch listen people get infected die around world really drive point home: 

You change sorting order. default sorted case rate. USA #1 course. sane Danish politician would never say “Do like Sweden” regardless Sweden circumstance. wouldn’t ride well. link Danish politicians said “We want Swedish herd immunity strategy”? Maybe Elon 50% convinced virus dangerous believes 50% chance [we living think depends lot state. I've tested twice past month Virginia got results back 3 days times. understand think I'd argue point understand. left hands agencies tasked pandemic prevention management rather politicans. entire issue word ""feds"" title swapped ""White House."" stop there? assume literally every student riddled disewase never socialize again? Totally worth right? They'll get sympathy me. landlord exploitation, plain simple. got told warehouse 7/31. got Monday going dismantle master's house master's tools. people work, better protected everyone else staying home. would true therapy-less, vaccine-less world. Since soon, countries suffered early deaths ones suffering deaths total. Well course hahaha Deductible? aca paid 100 month Co pays deductibles. want insurance employer pay 300ish 5k deductible. I'm glad people prior conditions got coverage screwed lot people US numerous problems plan.

Some legal issues, practical issues.

There precedent legally restricting actions movements actually confirmed infected people.

We little way constitutional guidance topic presuming population infected restricting movements freedoms individuals unknown status.

Similar testing. There's precedent focused forced testing particular suspicion exists, broad populations.

But beyond legal issues question compliance. significant portion population US simply comply. try locking up, run jail space.

Maybe society punishing we've become. realize voice-to-text typed “eating people” instead “aiding people,” I’m going let be.
Maybe someone reading get much-needed chuckle, knows? know TBH. even asymptomatic cases organ damage identified fairly common. problem stage know damage permanent not. mention diagnosed COVID, doctors want order things like ultrasounds organs, worried infecting technician performing scan. much current information organ damage based less reliable blood tests such. actually acting like 4% mean something lol? even many actually it, 4% answered would use it. example Canada something like 80% say would use mask actual number much lower. Sweden even amount people answering would extremely low lol. live Sweden seen 0 masks entire pandemic. You’re conflating equity cash. equity doesn’t belong company, belongs people shares. Home Depot can’t give away something don’t own. Danish average caseload still far lower Swedish average caseload, Denmark long way go towards Swedish conditions. 

And baseline Denmark around 15 cases per day, 30-60 range course cause large spike %, overall number remains low per capita compared worst affected Nordic country: Sweden. Sweden country adopt herd immunity policy region one point thousands new cases per day. Denmark extremely far that, new cases centered around one meat plant.

Further, Telegraph strongly biased favor Conservative party, earning nickname “Daily Torygraph”. 2017 elections, Telegraph backed Theresa May ( Prime Minister Leader Conservative Party since 2016): “Vote Conservative independent, prosperous Britain.” quote article demonstrating conservative bias “Only Theresa May attitude experience necessary get job done – get done cleanest, comprehensive way. Jeremy Corbyn incompetent wrongheaded dangerous.” also publish articles strongly biased Labor party this: “A Corbyn government would calamity – everything else noise”.
The Telegraph also republishes stories credible news media Reuters Associated Press.
The Telegraph regularly utilizes emotionally loaded language headlines source poorly, either quotations self-referral sourcing themselves. also routinely publish clickbait tabloid-style news “Is workout secret Jennifer Aniston’s youthful physique 50?” crime stories News section: “Libby Squire suspect charged stealing sex toys knickers women months disappearance student.” 
Recently, Telegraph issued apology letter Melania Trump publishing false statements regarding family modeling career also agreed pay substantial damages’ article published First Lady.

UV light (including ambient sunlight) rapidly disables virus' replicative ability. know droplets exist seems likely aerosolized particles exist well. Small droplet sizes seem (uncommonly rarely) able infect cell cultures. However *in vivo* animal models inoculated aerosolized virus, able readily infect animals. see Lancet article viruses tested evaluated viability, suffered pretty severe right skew one sample set.

Some questions remain: median infectious dose virus (ID50)? proportion viral particles replication-competent (the study showing 3 18 samples replicated suggest many)? well quantification viral load predict infectivity? Yet another new record yesterday. would be:

China could start trying intentionally disrupt cyberattacks, that's what's happened far reported. thing think revealing data would bad would reveal blindings early. trial patients medical professionals interacting cannot know who's gotten vaccine vs placebo.

On plus side, Florida still low per capita total deaths. currently rank #22, 29.81 deaths per 100k know Florida needs? 

Thousands people packed hurricane shelters. school gyms, wide open without walls, hundreds people hunkered together three days. say ""Fuck em"". die stupid that's problem. unique moment anti vaxx anti vaxxers almost exclusively adults vaccinated children thus *have protection* deciding gamble lives innocent children quackery. evil totally different sort. adults deciding die FB 'research'. like Hermann Cain, zero problem grown adults making whatever terrible choice want long they're ones bearing consequences. 

And please, waste time ""people can't get vaccine"". I'm well aware none going change people's minds sympathy eventual karma. can't tell linked photo Texas Florida states biggest downturn slope.

Here's follow took video: straight video: Good quality sleep daily something people tend forget. Helps immune system.

Probably also vitamins (always doubts efficacy hurt). particular Vitamin touted lot especially can't get sunlight (known big factor fall winter effects people's levels).

Edit: Also get pulse oximeter. Try monitor see notice first signs possible infection issue. stopped shopping Home Depot Lowes Domestic terrorism. party charge conducting failed public health care experiment months, throw children crucible. Great, save apes ourselves. /s would argue era rampant science denialism, science communicators play least equally important role allowing society benefit data-based decision making science provides original research. Meanwhile company laid half department :(

Fuck virus man. crazy companies like Lows Amazon making record numbers pandemic. benefited it. Wait how? done wrong? know Bernie Marcus involved THD like 20 years right? THDs covid response, especially relates employees, largely better Lowes.  Yep, that’s district saying. teachers legitimately discussing yesterday “I feel like let kids get friend’s cousin’s son whoever said like bad cold kids, don’t feel like wearing mask”, etc. Someone needs look interests Kodak. Irregular volume day deal announced; leaked Twitter, /r/pennystocks, apparently. mind, that’s kind insulation insider would want making illegal trade. Same. I'm tired bones hearing people talk ""hard working home is"". Wanna trade? joints begging you. I'm boat, wife due January. Got bathroom reno, new garage door and, landscaping work on! Home Depot around corner got bad one time I'd go Lowes 15 minutes away instead. actually wrote Home Depot crappy store. time ever done that. improved greatly since then. heard US military bringing there. know cause second wave. timeline correlate second spike due loosening restrictions? I'm Bill! Damn. beat it. Plan going expected. covid Olympics states right now. competition see stupid take top prize total deaths mask death total best (separate events). Right now, think Texas slightly lead, think Florida going give run money take gold grim reaper himself, Gov. DeathSantis. I've never head Salem, referred major city 😂 mean know state Capitol like...its nearly big Portland. Lowe's sucks. One best days life quit working five years ago. true. However health care US truly phenomenal coverage. get MRI minor injury literally next day (I've done it!) compared weeks longer wait times Canada. system perfect. Selfishly, US system great would absolutely abolish replace socialized medicine me. $4K bank account help store shelves empty. Lol, would ignore schedules whenever day I'd ""forget check time"" take whenever wanted to. stats always good enough get trouble. 

That said. Fuck job. Never again. hope don’t actually think anyone scared Iran. absolutely person classes 2021. one semester online pushing it. 2 essentially impossible. literally understand British politics. man unelectable.

He literally nutty conspiracy theory now?

[You pay way attention,  sure bad title. Sweden different attitude towards gov us. Recommendations largely followed thing like ridership public transportation traffic showed. incredible number people switched Working home. People voluntarily pretty good vivid response. restricted entire county. Shut schools, etc. 

While largely compliant enough. much higher death rate poorer countries like Portugal lockdown.

Nothing changed. company isn’t getting anyone tested. fucked. as; say need 80 hours pay survive. Better working 2 full time jobs, 40 hours job, 40 hours overtime job. tax shit overtime. I'm serious curious COVID change culture medicine US. doctor worked COVID handle antivaxx parents vaccine comes out? No, they're not. Various dosages demogragphic sets used phase III. true focus double shot likely get approved based phase II findings.However, testing one shot efficacy phase well.

Here trial groups used phase III Oxford example:

Groups get booster shot, (to compare):

* Group 1: n=80, aged 56-69 years, includes booster subgroup
* Group 2: n=120, aged 70 years, includes booster subgroup
* Group 4: n=3550, aged 18-55 years, includes booster subgroup

Children get booster shot:

* Group 3: n=60, aged 5 12 years, booster shot

Groups get two doses don't:

* Group 5: n=200, aged 18-55, includes 2 dose subgroup.
* Group 6: n=6000, aged 18-55, includes 2 dose subgroup.
* Group 7: n=80, aged 56-69, includes 2 dose subgroup.
* Group 8: n=120, aged 70 years older, includes 2 dose subgroup.

Groups everyone gets two doses:

* Group 9: n=1000, aged 56-69, get 2 doses
* Group 10: n=1000, aged 70 years over, get 2 doses help government try sneak things like $8B weapons procurement stimulus package thats supposed citizens

I glass small dent edge quite annoying inadvertently drink side glass. large enough justify throwing trash, would look like waste would feel guilty. still end using lot. glasses, similar without dent, gradually broken. one survives, together one kind initial six (I think). Lowes much better home depot even close Jingle flayer... holidays. really cruise ship? Hurtigroutes basically ferries depart almost whole Norwegian coast call numerous harbours. Then, one simply get board take ride, relatively cheap, without advance booking. done several times before. passengers actually cruise tourists abroad pay lot money trip, locals fly. addressing article. addressing statements. pointed out. 

No need respond. I'm putting bullshit insults getting blocked asshole. hillarious fast comment arrived.

Many Swedish deaths: ""They euthanizing elderly, literaly scum earth didnt lock down"".

Less Swedish deaths: ""Akchully, Sweden lock down"". apologize me, already quit job. Apologize 150k families people killed carelessness countrymen. Name one socialist country Europe? Soviet Union existed 30 years.  support Axis still go war... Amazon pays lot employees stocks. underpay relative rest FANG, bank stock appreciation keep employees happy.

If stock falls much, could spiral control. Skilled employees would leave, recruitment costs would skyrocket, means even less profits, stock price decreases even more, employees leave, etc.

AMZN stock dropping could literally cause death company.

Im saying right wrong. I’m explaining whole system works. anybody know RATE infection Wisconsin? curious currently looked like past couple months. thats important piece data here. test more, course total # positives going go rate steady, question mandate Never India, see really 4.3k month unemployment since 4 weeks months besides February weed. 420 blaze truly dont care. 

In response “why” situation. people go hurricane shelters/evacuation shelters (I know one predicted bad but, theoretically) places become places massive spread? People eating shelters, means wearing masks, everyone's packed together. here’s reddit blaming virus capitalism I've heard counties Tennessee purposely reported lower numbers enter ""softer, person school opening"". harm. definitely wear mask! get nobody likes me! \*jumping stomping feet corner\* would much easier convert virtual learning.

But kudos us stupid wrong thing every step way. That's read lol. passed short times, yearly overall total. would require close 600k. highest confirmed estimate i'm seeing around 200k end september (though think we'll bit higher that) obviously get control would see least atleast 100k december 31st.

march 1 march 1 even moreso april 1 april 1 pretty damn close fix soon  current protests barely scratching surface people angry over. know how? Sometimes seems Texas trying outflorida Florida. Lowe’s 100% choice competitors going forward. can’t say I’ll give business couple times year, every time will. Companies shown care workers ones deserve succeed. plenty I’ll happily watch fail. Jesus Christ work nursing home huge outbreak. time worked covid unit got extra $2 hour. taken away. arent even first wave? seems mistakenly thought 1 second instead 60 seconds. day 1440 60 seconds. one put flu.

In past five years, [NYS 5K flu deaths, NJ Yet they've seen [32k 15k covid respectively. Claiming flu wilful ignorance. like flu: always virus kills you, opportunistic infections get immune system wear fighting/after fighting virus. possibly keep employees working incentivizing leave go unemployment pays original pay stay opened pandemic? I'd surprised players outside kickers skinny WRs classed obese bmi Good Lord come surprise anyone actually paying attention. made pure ethanol, relatively safe drink (keyword relatively - essentially hard liquor, drink much stomach ulcers still die). However, purity standards ethanol used hand sanitizer much lower drinking alcohol, contain small amounts methanol safe use skin toxic ingested. 

Hand sanitizer also made disinfectants like isopropyl alcohol chlorine-based compounds never ever ingested. still better US that's sure. 88% Wisconsin deaths people 60. 96% deaths people 50. majority 70. Everywhere go Wisconsin people masks large minority. I’m trolling don’t like Reddit’s mask hard on. large majority people least interact never wore mask. flair small pox recently? Sorry, maybe im misremembering problem entirely blinkered. guess explained presumably living understanding UK politics. exactly Feds sent Portland. even think rising use extreme force stop you. read Republicans put payroll tax cut next coronavirus bill election year want accused cutting social security medicare.

That means programs popular enough Republicans feel need support them.

But time, extending Medicare everyone controversial enough Democrats put platform... Fuck Home Despot!  Dear corporate America, way take notes. Temporary suspension civil rights unconstitutional, Lincoln civil war, he's hailed hero Republic.

China bordered lot countries, fact bordered country world. seem issue China. also far longer US's border Mexico. Couldn’t afford it. Ha!! Which, combined voluntary measures, helped.

Sweden still astoundingly poor job citizens voluntarily taking seriously helped problem worsening. think restrictions remain place vaccine likely. mandate wear masks far shutdown though. 

There big spectrum positions ""total non essential business shutdown"" ""totally open like 2019"". think reasonable say reach totally open position vaccine widely distributed. 

I think major political leaders saying need total shutdown vaccine. steady state flattening curve balancing life/happiness/economy going somewhere spectrum. continue restrictions, lockdown. Got results morning 15 days ago. It’s useless. Goggles might needed , per Fauci Meanwhile, Home Depot donates anti gay Congress members doesnt care employees. r/actuallesbians time switch Lowes Good Lowe's. imagine helpful many workers. good see company taking care employees shareholders once. damn. guess 6/11 majority declaring bad guy. that's ridiculous.   Yes. is. it’s pathetic. However, mask mandate becomes city/county law, Sheriff obliged enforce it. refuse, state judge remove Sheriff office dereliction. behoove employing hospital confirm outside temp workers confirmed corona free? dont understand logic, employer allowed work confirmation corona free. Currently working renovations, making sure want get supplies go big box store! Deaths per capita ranks Sweden 8th US 10th. Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, Peru, Chile course Sweden worse less 15 test positive you’re asking stay home, that’s LOT kids picked you’re probably already deep outbreak don’t know it.

Asymptomatic mean contagious. Kids spread effectively adults. [Here’s CDC study proves 

I’ve got 4 kids pre-K 12. minimize fact online learning Utah poor substitute class, minimizing impactful it’s mental health, home learning disproportionately impacts minority children, low-income children kids disabilities. significantly puts risk educators risk. someone becomes infected, significantly outnumbered. earth would people stay/work Walmart many places hiring. I'm sorry man absolute waste life idiots idiocracy seem smart comparison real life elected leaders. Losing job often turn spenders savers. happened 9/11 2008.  decided become self-employed trust companies employ longer. best decision made I'm completely self-sufficient, albeit reliant economy exist.  pretty much No, right like Donald. one reason said runs walks least 3.5 miles day Yeah, reduced max capacity business hours places. fucking joke. Walmart closes 9pm now, rest day still get packed bunch ""coronavirus hoax"" morons. fucking helping. Well, Amazon know bonuses withheld 40% could given higher bonuses ensure employees took home $500.

Not required would awesome move part. literally CDC said. think conspiracies could be. 100% believe covid real political theater geared towards profits trust anything anyone government positions Ok cool, glad know youre lazy butthole cant google goddam drug yourself. That’s weird kind gaslighting. supposed make think he’s bright cannot read? I... tricked believing that? What’s point? make fuckers wear masks? local Lowe’s like maybe 30% people wearing masks. maybe, maybe, media coverage virus absolutely insanely misleading. 

In NY papers saying ""look mass graves!"" Ignoring fact people buried Hart Island 150 years new practice many people dying. 

 top that, basically every search engine social media platform relentlessly censors anything even slightest bit critical perspective idea virus super deadly. 

So point, people worked irrational state fear they're thinking critically. That's look it. One, wear consideration others. Two, play percentages. Risk mitigate. I'm inside anywhere home, I'm wearing it. Left wing papers attack right wing politicians.


Oh man see problem here

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 already hot mess....? Fauci say wants. court public opinion determine early roll vaccine.

If countries start reopen cases plummet, countries start reopen plummet.... It'll domino effect, want last kid stuck detention.

At least that's see going. Honestly, safety established - 100pct effectiveness less important, epidemiological scale. Even slightest degree vaccinated immunity give population, helpful all, including uninfected unvaccinated buffered now-vaccinated socially interact with. start mass outbreak deaths going go lot china create covid make batch anti aging serum /s yeah, priority letter 8 (EIGHT) days. So...how many weeks regular mail? Overnight mail 3 days least now. Thank you! helpful. VA unreasonable comparison basically impossible US switch directly centrally administered VA model.

Medicaire closer analogy publicly funded care would actually look like. Tennessee magically come Sweden, example. concept. Bill Gates always favourite billionaire. mean probably shady fuck aswell still angel compared people like Musk, Bezos, Zuckenberg, Tim Cook.... Spend time waiting 
For second chance 
For break would make okay Thanks that’s good know. assuming vaccine-based immunity take place US EOY 2021 pleasantly surprised when/if it’s sooner. insanity. They've already exhausted lockdowns. point, Americans kind lockdown almost 4 months. one going stand another one. already seeing massive non-compliance (not America, BTW, many countries seeing this, hence rising cases). Without societal, individual willpower, way enforce order law enforcement, -- given current political climate -- going happen.

I fully support lockdowns, ignored human behavior. Asking people lockdown homes like running country expectation unmarried people sex -- perhaps nice ideal, work planning country. Since las vegas texas? Make Fine 49 try telling tourists Downtown Nashville used point laugh Sheriff's Department area used quotation marks ""To protect serve"", especially since written comic sans.

Starting realize bad decision-making whoever making liveries. lot articles tell us move on, new normal, find way live it.

I always find useful ask questions like, ""If go work get sick, benefits? belong group people telling can't afraid forever?""

All media propaganda degree US argued legal right lie us via news really get better asking questions. Right hospitals aren’t path overwhelmed need lockdown? European countries done Covid yet... Goodness two? must really well virus sure.  shows much money Lowe's Home Depot making lately. Everyone bored home improvement projects. can't even keep lumber shelves. mistranslation OP. doesn’t fit though Actually, still hoax we're definitely way past Easter..../s (just case). much stronger position neighbors. always end game. good news. need treatments anything know people think regarding testing, force people take what?

Ah, see, bars play role. Amos?

Edit: Amos. remember reading lines first novel. really cement everything need know character. always assumed asymptomatic meant symptoms, spread virus. Even they're coughing, etc , salvia, phlegm, etc. would still viral load. wrong?

I'm sure tracking asymptomatic patients valid critique study. anything, relatively small sample knock for. perhaps results generalizable. Anyways, we're going find next month schools colleges start open up.

You’re right. right line spring break many vacationers move. provinces spared spring breaks weeks still gave lockdowns opportunity work. early, Ontario Quebec, people already gone time lockdowns mandated. many returned, mostly US, opportunity spread occurred. Watching case numbers rising corresponded trend. fair kind change always going happen. explosion Amazon evidence need middle low tier brick mortar services dated less desirable. drone technology near future current coardnatuon apps like GrubHub/instacart/door dash/ect delivery name game future decades.

We getting started.

To say 2008 crash ""much worse economically"" short-sighted, best. Well then...at least Postmortem Malone won’t opinion. Factual reality do. Much covering incompetence, though people mix upper lower case letters, they're joking Depends efficiency uptake. vaccine 75% efficiency 75% uptake, means anyone virus spread 50% people, half R0.

It's silver bullet help like social distancing masks. extra reduction R0 becomes easier prevent outbreaks. Lowe’s HD economic impacts 2nd closure far worse first. IMO don’t think Ontario send anyone back stage 1. would far disastrous economically would make government look really bad. accurate testing compared March?

Flu bro... first wave hasn’t ended yet..... literalist also believes Universe made within 7 24 hour periods (whatever would even mean earth sized planet revolve certain speed).

If aren’t literalist understand “knowledge good evil” mean willing participation evil despite knowing ramifications good evil.

The original Hebrew translation text contains grammatical version noun/verb translating “knowledge” “experience” depending conjugation.

The problem wasn’t “knowledge” good evil sense comprehending it, participating it, consuming fruit metaphorically internalizing making part oneself. 

From I’ve gathered, Jewish tradition Adam Eve mingled good evil, rendered experience world morally ambiguous opened door confusion, chaos rationalization evil. It’s terribly unlike Pandora’s box.

The part “like God” according serpent doesn’t mean actually obtaining God-like knowledge power eating fruit. means perceiving experiencing evil level closer God’s comprehension, people unlike God shortsighted omniscient, really understand evil experience way experience inflict evil someone inflicted themselves.

The solutions present gov chose ignore them, whole thing political move suppress opposition. Yup, well now. still get temperatures anywhere near cold northernmost north hemisphere.  guess might still behave similarly though, Aussies 14 degrees Celsius may fuck cold. Unless work hospital, would even begin know ""normal"" ffs? UK worst, hospitals asking fit healthy volunteers non skilled jobs transferring patients, basic cleaning etc etc. local hospital requiring help volunteer see first hand? Anything anyone says water duck's back. changing mind unless put situation. Can't bad see nothing different like working given non pandemic time. smell odor samples safely specialized containers. also seems don’t get infected easily mild case. reported deaths pets Covid. Look, know well much school opening endangers lot people, families students, teachers, even students themselfs. need look student's perspective. University students high school students would maybe effected, students first grade till late high school need social interaction collective education. 
30 years ago might learn social skills going friends, since PCs, smartphones, internet, spending free time outside people normal. 
Today children go socialize much much less, spend day computer phone, playing games better case, social networks worse case. Internet harsh place, often damaging children. Thus results social anxiety, depression often suicides. Kids need real life friends learn interact.
 goes education, much really going learn couch? many kids voluntarily educate themselfs, without extremely stressed? Even one year lost eternity developments young brains. us multiple times worse special needs kids, isolation causes tantrum meltdowns. parents also need kids home. final question wheather missing improper development 50 kids worth one seniour life? schools running damage future generatiin think. Telegraph knows people feel strongly wave call it. Profitable title. It’s really risk getting severely sick greatest risk reopening schools; real risk spread virus increase community transmission vulnerable demographic groups. Well he's mask expert listen right? Wait... That's enough time get sick Covid19, hospitalized go ventilator get results finally discharge you.

Speaking experience co-worker went ventilator. He's still recovering whole ordeal back March - April. government immoral laws though? bible says lots things. That’s bold claim. 2008 crash much worse economically don’t consider 12 years ago long time.  Pull numbers show Portland area protests overall highest number cases based percentage population. 

You cannot simply case. Fauci working had, faithful science. could convinced morons charge things earlier, maybe things would different. understand, guy charge believes stupid things like human body battery exercising runs battery. also laughably believes ""the media's"" fault people liking him, he's way likable without heavy editing propaganda. joke. living joke, calling one beacons hope ""fool"" wrong something changing mind. 

I'd say fool one thinks acceptable leader one right 100% time, fool one parrots talking points coming certain-colored house. may seemed ""obvious"" us needed happen, responsibility preventing national panic coupled convince morons charge need take really drastic measures.

Has anything official K-12 schools forcing kids back remote learning options?

I friend worked home started remote learning huge burden her. Even though Maine small amount active cases, want send kids back school happening.

Are school districts going provide remote option decide want not? really baffles mind. Republican Party traditional family values, current president done create division among citizens resulted constant fighting. terrible.

Edit: point video New York Times, leans pretty far left. doubt sentiment people video, video basically left making right look like fool. aerosol transmission prevalent, way would avoided infected now

[and others noticed ""irregularities"" reported case counts appears started right around time White House insisted hospitals report numbers HHS rather CDC -- around July 13-16.

[This change visible looking 7 day averages new daily Additionally discrepancies vs. behavior specific states depending political affiliation states.  **To people familiar real-world data behaves, looks suspicious, seems reduce number reported cases vs we'd expect trend this.**

Also depends look market. major indices fine, still highs that's driven massive rotation big tech. Apple, Amazon, Microsoft - many - hit time high time high. makes sense certain companies, particularly large megacap tech companies, benefit evidenced yesterday's earnings. look individual stocks - plenty still down, way down. 

And think there's plenty manipulation going on.. hard manipulate entire market. micro sense, influenced enough capital still market. one willing buy Apple today anything $300 share, Apple would trade there. “Keep Wearing Damn Mask!”

""A mutant strain coronavirus researchers believe infectious rampaging across globe moved Bay Area, conflicting views tiny deviant impacting people.

The mutated virus, known G strain, appears studies contagious — six times transmissible — original strain coronavirus emerged last year Wuhan, China, believed make 70% infections worldwide.

It established dominant strain virtually every state, including California, makes majority cases Bay Area, according infectious disease specialists.

But although scientists agree SARS-CoV-2 — specific coronavirus causes COVID-19 — made significant genetic change, disagree problematic recalibration likely humanity. Everyone agrees revamped virus deadly old one acknowledge doesn’t cause severe illness.

'This coronavirus evidence I’ve seen,' said Joshua Batson, senior data scientist Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, nonprofit research organization focuses collaborative science, referring behavior virus G strain mutation.

Clearly, though, something changed virus’ inner workings, leaving scientists worried world battling souped-up version disease.

The subject concern, case, really tiny mutation found known D614G, one 1,300 amino acids coronavirus genome. mutations, essentially evolution shortened time scale, common coronaviruses, including four strains cause common cold symptoms.

Studying mutations integral part contact tracing, essentially following family tree virus.

When definitely understand story Pandora’s Box Summer come passed, distancing never last March man named Gregory Rigano claimed advisor Stanford School Medicine involved hydroxychloroquine study. lied credentials involvement Stanford. also falsified early results study removed data patients hydroxychloroquine died. posted lies online gained viral attention. Elon Musk saw post boosted Rigano’s claim made go viral. March 18, 2020 Tucker Carlson hosted Rigano allowed make claims without fact-checking vetting. Trump watched show mentioned hydroxychloroquine press briefing March 19, 2020. Fox News repeated Trump’s claim hydroxychloroquine “game changer”. next week Fox promoted use hydroxychloroquine 147 times! Every time Trump saw “News” hydroxychloroquine, convinced hydroxychloroquine “game changer”. Trump’s mind became fixated hydroxychloroquine miracle drug. Trump never realized created circular logic loop based lies.

Doctors researchers said soon draw conclusions hydroxychloroquine since scientific studies completed. soon found fierce back-lash contradicting President. America’s head vaccine scientist, Rick Bright director US health department’s Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority, fired Trump challenging Trump’s claims. doctors threatened reminding us science yet complete. Hydroxychloroquine became offered standard treatment many hospitals since Fox News watchers Trump believers convinced essential life saver. people improperly self medicating hydroxychloroquine dying. Worldwide demand hydroxychloroquine shifted significantly, making difficult acquire Lupus Malaria patients genuinely needed it.

Other hydroxychloroquine studies across globe continue prove hydroxychloroquine help fight COVID-19, increase incidence cardiac arrest stroke patients. net effect hydroxychloroquine COVID-19 negative.

This example exact opposite scientific process. Trump Fox consider original source hype hydroxychloroquine completely based lies, disallowed genuine scientific proof. spite large body scientific proof hydroxychloroquine ineffective, demand uneducated still remains strong. people easily swayed unscientific hype tend people distrust genuine science view issues politics override science failure science. learn truth hydroxychloroquine, write “the scientists lied wrong” instead “my politician Fox lied don’t understand science.”

The hydroxychloroquine Trump/Fox disaster isolated. pattern unvetted circular logic found over. Fox News Tucker Carlson claimed court obligation investigate truth statements viewers expect truth. idea aren’t random sampling know 20 percent people think risk positive Yes.

Possibly, unlikely. [For example, Florida, positivity rate quite high 18-20% fairly Usually sign testing saturated positivity rate goes up, critical cases getting tested. Since positivity rates stable, means testing gotten overloaded currently.

Currently working Pepsi cut Hazard pay months ago started testing health care staff limited testing severe cases. Last four weeks 10% positive cases categorized severe (in patient care elderly care).

If extrapolate apply early weeks Swedish pandemic saw roughly 3000 confirmed cases week. absolute majority severe. equals 30 000 cases week roughly 4300 cases day. 

We also know testing running 15:th June .We registered 12654 cases 21:th june 4:th July. estimated 10 days positive test ICU since thats median Swedish ICU registry. also assume people getting tests showing symptoms. 1:st 14:th July 28 people admitted ICU Sweden. Thats 0,2% infected. 0,2% instead represents 40 ICU admissions, rough number per day peak, get 20 000 cases horrific days. 

This calculation several problems. dont know viral loads important, dont know many cases missing (very mild asymptomatic) dont know many infected didnt produce measurable antibody defence name few. also know many hadnt able test first weeks June. Also, ICU policies might chances.

Anyhow safe say influx huge. missed cases minimum magnitude peak. missed best friend's small wedding recently... Or, really streamed it. best friends since diapers, lived together college, referred sisters. But, wedding, one wore masks, social distancing. We're still best friends know wanted there.

Seriously, people living lives normal. way less cases.  Yeah, think concern lot people - including Fauci - talking vaccines.

Good job? Whoever started claiming kids can’t get Covid-19 back March? probably heard repeated DeBlasio most. Wtf?

Okay, people started act kids naturally *immune* it. case all, common sense approach. 

They also figured kids get it, it’s sniffle asymptomatic, they’re safe. never addressed fact kids get Covid-19 still transmit disease. It’s like people say chicken pox; kids get it’s supposedly bad, want get young sucks worse kill adult. Part equation though adults never chicken pox stay far, far away kids it. Also, *know* kid chicken pox. Covid-19. So, dangerous treating kids immune. 

It’s dumb think it’s safe let kids get exposed disease. Even likely favorable outcomes, every kid favorable outcome. shouldn’t pro-vaccination pro-school opening. 

The lack common sense comes kids pandemic alarming. He's destroying lives overseas vaccines, could soon happen here. That's much better. mutated, minorly. suspect vaccine work original strain mutations, since they're almost same. [Of course moon made question is, kind?

""Look, ones protect violent anarchists!"" haven’t heard mentioned much colleges planning students campus publishing plans include *LOTS* testing. Testing they’re leave home. Testing arrive.

That’s fine good here’s problem: majority plan use test processing facilities general public relies upon, already running 2 weeks+ behind (many) places.

Colleges talking hundreds thousands tests. way testing would work max 48-hr wait results. 

Everyone living college towns doomed. *Boston alone* gets 360,000+ college students year. Jeff Bezos, personally, made like 13 billion last year.

however, since increase number cases hump (duration month June only) .. mean testing eased ? would ?

**TL;DR**:

• Open windows: Air-flow best first-defense. 
• Face-shield—yes! 
• N95 + surgical mask top. keep moving goal posts lol.

Amazon pays surprisingly little tax, agree.

However last year pay $162 million.

When pay little tax, behaving exactly way tax code intends behave. FedGov get cut somewhere along like regardless. Bullshit. easily afford continue it. Even Amazon owner take pocket genius: genius salesman. Steve Jobs. weirdos also. know countries like Italy family often live elderly report feeling lonely elderly Sweden? love fauci, im getting tired (not ""sick it"" mentally exhausted) changes dates No, home improvement stores making way money year last year. Yes, suppliers running low sales also massively up. know work one. July 18th Florida 7,768 excess deaths 4,898 attributed Covid. Using ratio, Florida might 400 actual Covid deaths today (official count 256). I’m following guidelines. stay home whenever possible. go it’s grocery store, pharmacy.  things I’d like worth risks. I’m entitled enough think much want something somehow mitigates risk. fatalities people like follow rules science. outliers though. part it’s going people chose ignorant. sooner purge people less innocent people actually die. say let go hog wild. last school shooting PA? School death sentence. watched hearing morning, general specifically GRILLED time taken return test results. pulled statistic claiming majority tests coming back timely fashion, plenty people pointed repeated stories test results taking weeks come back. 

I think next statistic need start tracking histogram long takes report test results. would also useful seeing recently cases infected accurately test results reflect current reality. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

So here's problem. Unless vaccinate entire world time, going mutate enough it'll spread despite vaccine, like influenza. 

If people vaccinate developer antibodies it, vaccine even going work? burden proof person making statement, asking proof. misinformation spreads like wildfire social media.

The first quarter grew 0.1% still can't wrap head around plan makes logical sense. can't deny virus away. September/October endless stories faculty, parent kid deaths. benefiting strategically? talking 2020. talking last quarter. course thing dropped everyone beginning. seems Canada able recover fighting virus head on. US sank another 9% quarter. (32% annual rate) Even so, behavior towards countries clearly shows care get vaccinated not. practical reason care Spain.

Or France.

""Are children immune COVID 19?""

That's stupid fucking question. strawman. Nobody claiming children immune COVID 19.  Current confirmed cases 80K 5743 deaths. However, confirmed cases prior June (about 37000) severe cases health care staff. Forreal. wanna die weird corporate loyalty doesnt mean want too. 

They positive COVID test husbands job never even shut down. problem vets, forces used stand good, decent folks left.

I’m disagreeing retired vets protected cared constitution, aren’t serving anymore. 

I’ll shut fuck start act like force good one cares document cult leader. also care, point happy someone's death.. national response game plan would nice. Haha. Funny say well known middle-eastern immigrants vastly overrepresented covid cases covid deaths. kind hilarious, years ago one arguing Messiah cool shit I'm opposite.

Need specify sure Neither. fall cliff responsibility town bottom. Steve Scalise asked Fauci Trump's travel bans saved lives Fauci said yes.

But would curious hear Fauci answer question Trump's decisions cost lives. would ask net was. Remember Elon musk seen near universally god Reddit Why? Yeah CVS went popup disinfectant-wipe dispensers door beside card readers; sketchy unbranded pump bottles mystery gloop 😣  fence? quick vaccine made kinda understand people would hesitant Yeah, will.

WRONG!!! every time get someone makes sort sense Democrat, say want ban guns single issue voters come droves. wish democrats would stop gun talk see works. camp, **which CDC name**, held orientation 120 staff members 130 trainees mid-June


Why fuck naming them? need publicly shamed dragged mud. bullshit. Well, bunch politicians, inevitable. I'd interested questions GOP asked, lack patience watch. guess made speeches said nothing all, asked almost questions. I'm happy anyone traveling right now. ment bustling tourist state ideal neighbor pandemic. hate state inhabitants. know I’m unbridled consumption.

Let's keep tuberculosis this.

Florida already dealing mosquito born diseases top hurricane season covid19. employees required wear masks, stores provide customers masks hand sanitizer, guessing legal department wouldn’t let make mandatory. stores near push pretty hard wear masks. Oops. That’s happens math fully awake. Lol true. CDC involved outbreak since 2014 instrumental controlling Africa, caught extremely quickly efforts. outbreak USA fatal either, thanks cases noticed early, remember numbers. 

It 20 infected, great response. Cases increase started opened border. opinion related visitors. said yourself, 10 cases day 100000k low, low. opinion, detection borders good enough. worrying Canada, even stop virus still gigantic border US. US gets shit together still worry new outbreaks. Hehe money cleaner go brrrr prefer college games anyway. /s real numbers closer 0.3%,

0.3% would approx 947,000 people.  That's still lot. understand, apparently “clarifying” statement T. gave exact quote someone else’s line questioning. exact quote “Children mostly immune COVID-19”. Obviously, not. think got confused children mostly going die it. line questioning make look dumb...but really doesn’t need help there. forgive cross-post, I'll repeat typed another educator below:

Opening windows classroom one best available prophylactic measures. Diffusing viral particles enclosed space reduce potential viral-load. allowed also open door hallway, even better.

Given scant evidence transmission via eyes, think that's appropriate level protection; though, researchers found presence ACE2 receptors COVID patients' eyes, post-mortem.

**TL;DR**:

• Open windows: Air-flow best first-defense.

• Socially distance much practical.

Handy infographic .PDF ASTM procedural/surgical masks explanation levels Source ACE2 receptors found COVID patients' eyes, post-mortem Sure, misreporting after? Everyone gonna spin way *want* be. Seems Fauci enjoying sidelines indeed! need fence. I'm buddy,guy! Bullshit. myth perpetuated pussies. That's think funny this. charge actually taken seriously, we'd basically ramping now. likely would cheaper too. didn't, we're send kids school month, likely going get worse people /r/Kanye scare me.

I dared slightly criticize behavior pandemic [look [these got.  actually think work every dollar make knocks 50 cents UBI. way everyone making less $4000 month still making money UBI without, everyone making limit making enough necessary anymore. Like total economic collapse posted sub, course going hit negatives opinion like this. need stop Repub vs Dems this. one corner gas station wearing mask Repub white woman two black, assume, Dems. 
Also blame twerking parties Karen's kids bbq'ing without making race/political thing. ALthough Govt. county declared racism public health emergency, guess wearing mask blacks live around so, oppressing (and live majority black right MLK Drive). run TV ads great safety #1! Ya know like Amazon since employees started kicking bucket. good pro pitcher makes one inning people year. Maybe I'm selfish put single sports person's life anyone else, damn sure own. Many many many many people keep selfishly violating orders continues spread kill.

Fucking president keeps telling to. makes sense state reporting this. rt.live nj .95 covidactnow 1.06.

the highest infection rate rt.live 1.25 hawaii.

how fuck state calculating infection rate? know craziest statistic is? Florida almost 500k active cases right now. death rate known cases approx 1% 6% see lot people dying one state. w f wrong people? think asking run around naked something. damn wrong wearing mask... hard fast like NZ. reopen amazing contact tracing self isolation rules, REALLY good that, get cases almost nothing, nothing.

You quarter population, probably order 100M people, believe virus problem absolutely comply another shutdown. fantasy think will. also enough police enforce anywhere close level that's needed. going to, arrest 100M people? put where? Fining anything. also like police stellar reputation trusted right now. Even people agreed original shutdowns deniers probably going go along again.

We can't even get police population (either choice lack resources) enforce mask mandates now, gentle soft-handed get, think they're going able enforce another shutdown uncooperative population?

It's going happen, sooner people accept better be. absolutely another one matter bad things get. best, get limited rollbacks things like indoor dining, even that's going realistic there's full government support owners, clear isn't.

This video game get retries. chance 3 months ago gone. Arguing another one counterproductive waste time. I've got family chilling fridge funeral home. I'm still holding hoax. that's $322.58 bonus divided evenly before? information hospitals get paid person’s death treatment classified COVID related true according Minnesota State Sen. Scott Jensen. successful business owner hes engineering movement people 

You're jumping hoops try classify Elon engineer. stop start arguing HR department employees engineers ""engineering"" hiring human resources. Don’t bootstraps? /s american, idiot, shithead? $150,000 ton money, also consider people expecting make lot more. expect make, spend. player expected make 1.5 million they'd making 10 times less opting out, mortgages, car payments, etc. would still 1.5 million level. that's considering lots guys spend irresponsibly. 

I'm crying guys, $150,000 ton money, simple people make be. Mine has, reached hr? still earning additional hourly pay. guess take full credit creation. think really underestimating damage 2-3 year lockdown do. lockdown really great get virus control come better treatments vaccine takes 2+ years, economy would trashed. It’s easy say people prioritizing money lives damage 2+ year lockdown would way money. Distance learning really effective many kids. fine short periods time 2 years distance learning diminished social interaction developing child life long consequences. business close. people lose jobs. idea kind havoc financial stress causes family? need shield vulnerable, wear masks, continue lighter, sustainable lockdown. 1 50 people 45 test positive end hospital recover fully.

This terrible disease old people people conditions younger healthy people rarely major effects it. say happen, rare worth worrying about. analysis lower middle class' odd conservatism completely point well-described half-class conscious theorists far afield Marx, King Jr., LBJ, Roosevelts.

I'm starting unserstand american culture much better, little little. problem dumb one. forget touch rich common person. might great startups things comes common sense things lacks lot. answer, think does! IMHO choice obvious kids lives priceless husband got tested VA last week received result 48 hours. work Lowe’s too! confirm^ interesting, company opposite yours. work fairly large shipping company, сoncidentely also Northern NJ. recently announced week's vacation pay salaried employees including work throughout pandemic. mounting evictions, bankruptcies job losses, mass disorder seems imminent. year hell get much worse.  tangent expression: “pull bootstraps” originally coined convey trying impossible.

In surreal funhouse world come mean opposite? 

An oligarchy. I’ve working Home Depot (no hate Lowe’s, y’all hardware store family), haven’t gotten sort pay increase despite operating even initial lockdown. employee benefits they’ve always been, pretty exclusive. store work one regions highest rated, quite thankful (especially terms cleanliness sanitization), overall I’m extremely impressed they’ve “valued” associates crisis. work online order associate well service desk, considerable amount customer interaction (and curbside pickup, frequently encounter individuals without masks). I’ve read countless times, think future endeavors occupational searches, extremely telling ask “what differently employees COVID?” wear mask. get explain mask rule rude customers. still put length shifts pay COVID. college student I’m grateful could still land summer job, seeing many let go due pandemic, man. don’t understand everyone treats Elon differently. plenty people made lot predictions didn’t come true COVID-19. everyone make big deal said? COLDEST? Seriously? 

Because he's influential figure also kept downplaying continues downplay seriousness covid? Created Shopify. Can’t see issues that. /s mean two weeks? Moderna's problem never target per se, delivery mRNA cells.  Myocarditis heart failure. Heart failure specific condition, much serious myocarditis. One articles search posted able give “what means vaccine” section. get annoyed Elon dude full thinks he's like god something cuz cars runs batteries LMFAO Elon ain't field u know shit disease society runs situations stick vegan cars I'm waiting crowd decry John Lewis funeral, people masks, virtually social distancing. silly micro-manage people protests, churches funerals point sad. unnecessary tragedy. many Americans kept sedate enough panem/circuses rebel also kept precipice losing everything remind could gone second thus support system

I'm starting get puzzle totally crazy american culture. mean, Fauci saying COVID hoax going change mind anyone saying COVID hoax. hey’re probably one businesses who’s seeing huge increase sales.

The whole outdoor industry bananas right now, worth. I'm bike industry we're hitting record numbers. morons force now, care anymore. twisting knots hand waive away uptick cases. Local chatter sounding awful lot like denial coming Texas couple months ago.  Yeah positivity rate around 2.5% nearly 30,000 tests. near bad headline sub makes seem done lob calculate much taxes needed truly end additional $300 tax. Jeez Yeah cough workd ending. Guys, like knew day coming.  I'd love get back work...if furloughed (womp womp) Cameroon “When let people communicate....” not? Nah, that's Earth sonny Jim. Chinese publicly saying airborne since least April. ""mask mandate"" ""mask law""? point elected officials going job pass law masks? 

Why pass law criminalizing people wear masks? stiff fine people wearing masks, money goes local police? Create incentive police arrest people wearing masks, think happen? Easy. Everyone starved death, coronavirus 1. Mask-wearing become identity thing, admit wrong wearing mask admit might wrong stuff, too.

2. Mask-wearing highly identifies member ""other"" tribe, one half political apparatus very, close outright calling violence tribe they're already there. Seriously, spend time small town rural community talking folks. I've family move rural towns start nowhere making comments like ""I'd like take bat such-and-such politician's face"" ""God, wish so-and-so would get raped they'd shut fuck up"". help multiple media sources country pretty fucking close playing Hutu radio stations. Shift shift? following cdc guidelines problem. stretching defense use cliche Hitler comparison dodge bullet skeletons. Shit. Put mask ask.... Maybe, hospitalizations known now. *that country want mention mods remove comment*

""It's coming together"" impossible countries reopened spike cases sweden people go out, go shopping, lives, masks, extraordinary social distance measures spike cases.

Sweden already spike. Well amazing. bills wet enough easily fall apart. set like Canada's would best option. true, part let go refused sacrifice weekends new wife. reasons, big part it. That's I'm really salty though, haphazard directions things could occasionally change whim due miscommunication perceived levels completeness exactly inline reality, despite relayed upper management. made prioritization nightmare times, division labor would never exactly clear, often leading competition among employees trying get bigger slices responsibility order make valuable company appear productive.  Nah man unions socialism can't current occupant house white capital certain states United stick shitty failed businesses instead imposing authori tar ian rule. file complaint court, mean valid lawsuit. sane lawyer judge going waste time nonsense.

And want gamble that? take risk? happens wrong? Dude piece shit insanely good pr. anyone even begins look Tesla factories handle accidents would piss anyone off

Edit: bet guys didn’t know bought Tesla PayPal. smart yeah he’s genius came things spouting bullshit really easy look up?

Because he, like several accounts sub, basically live spread negative news Sweden relation covid. rarely seem Sweden talk swedish. sure about, find weird people interest/hobby. get come Sweden might mispleased tactics, relation country all? TL;DR Dentists recommend go dentist. concerned might risk poor COVID outcomes (since may become infected dental visit), might consider coming dentist. Here, buy $250 toothbrush using affiliate link. Shortstop far go otherwise better show commisioner's trophy Unenforced laws dont work.

Red light cameras work.  isn’t news, Dr Fauci said it’s already said before. It’s also unlikely effective vaccine rate mutation. expect... better? fact, I'd like see us collectively demand it. also say many long-term health consequences infections.

The reason is, aspects tbd.

""""I say again, young people almost immune disease."" -Trump 31-JULY-2020 that’s we’ve done UK it’s worked, means people get different amounts depending wages, someone minimum wage different expenses someone £45k year Hopefully we'll see somewhat subdued flu season given masks become prevalent. recall seeing reports covid countermeasures reducing spread influenza southern hemisphere. Kids spread it! /s wait kids go school decide want trade masks think someone else's cooler theirs. Whether herd immunity novel virus even possible unknown. anti-science preach otherwise, reliable data yet. stupid people hear want hear. lot statistics covid-19 different countries shows children get covid-19 (at lower rate adults may 2 times less best) spread almost never get serious condition. idiots' ears ended ""kids immune!"". I’m embarrassed country can't listen leading medical expert advisor. least today Fauci made clear today yes, little children *do* get coronavirus. ""Bicho malo muere"" spanish equivalent, ""bad bugs die"" Dude, take xanax something beyond paranoia. really worth living like that? shown virus spreads aerosolized particles surface-to-surface. viron size &amp; transmission vectors, though. 

Since reading Feb, I've comfortable masks4All way main mitigation measure. shitty spandex/lycra mask things - - ""my first mask"" purchase, dial multi-layer higher thread count fabrics (and stiffeners keep away nostrils/mouth) R0 number drop enough. mean main mitigation measure ahead mass supply vaccines 12mo now. saying like single Republican proposed another health care plan. feel like usa going going bad state childrens bodies going left freezer trucks, wont fucking room bury people, yes thankfully wont many children dying it, still fucking die hell might anyones kid next thats gonna die next weeks, think anyone wants watch child die hospital bed, hell point hospitals gonna deny care going watching kid die bed pain aggony get listen last fucking cries. please kid prefer potentially loose leave orphan try every possible way keep school cause anyones best hopes dreams watching another room child begs cries yeah he'll fine .2% death rate solution stay home nothing what, entire pandemic? think that's little overkill? We've seen countries successfully reopen proper precautions place. citizens can't follow guidelines mean work Anyone wants go functions involving large crowds, avoid wearing masks, go church, go work, etc may things freely long distance people chosen isolate themselves.

I'd agree also sign waver prevents getting medical attention sick. People stupid selfish allowed infect healthcare workers take valuable ICU beds ones everything stop virus spreading. We'll also need special grocery stores people get essential supplies without getting sick. people courage confront facts. Ignorance bliss. Democrat support mask Republicans automatically oppose it

We know fact. Republican governors, mayors, politicians, come support wearing masks.

It comes voters want. majority voters favor masks, gerrymander however way want, law still going pass politicians want remain office. majority people favor law, people Wisconsin blame. easier dismantle social security Medicare fewer people them! Hey Cherokee schools open person Monday. social distancing masks required. like 23% kids went remote. high officially, numbers Worldometer gives 2%. Probably 5% given don’t catch cases, officially it’s 2%. pRoNoUnCeD kYlE “Stick policy failure like me.” Chyna Depends. millennials start writing history textbooks instead baby boomers, different tone might taken It’s called computer/internet. Failing things called books. School shouldn’t arbitrary tests teach children pass districts get money give selves raises. School actually learning useful things. know it’s shocking. read chain level passing responsibility controlling pandemic next level below. exclusively shopping instead HomeDepot foreseeable future. like federal government made unemployment basically death sentence lot people work bars. hasn’t worked executive Microsoft since 2008 even board member anymore. really want blame past Microsoft leader, blame Balmer. touching someone injure them, even they're already injured? Look, hard culpability without remaining completely oblivious transpired. ""80 year old thrown floor?"" Well.. I... ""BETTER IGNORE THAT!"" fucked every level.

Just file complaint court, mean valid lawsuit. sane lawyer judge going waste time nonsense. That's thing though, based epidemiological modelling (unless count entirely debunked Imperial College model), unprecedented backed evidence. 
 Oh, can't ways ""not flu"". Since, per pro-lockdown logic, COVID behaves nothing like flu, 1918 pandemic irrelevant. Good tip nasal saline. happens again, I'll try that. coughing fits horrible. Maybe am, intentional. However agree pay way less taxes should. Something term “coronavirus bonus” sounds wrong. Lol. 

Seriously though, that’s really awesome remember shop future, even though don’t go home improvement stores much. makes sense...lol. sure would heard store putting kinds numbers! hire bouncer restaurants like clubs Patio bussing sucks man. 

Greenroom hot day brunch shift way better. idiot, see? Yes cases skyrocketing dramatically past 70,000 per day showing absolutely sign slowing down, evil liberal CDC getting data anyone, they're going again! Everything's solved! /s parents sold modest suburban home AC + major updates. market less week. neighbors' sold NINE HOURS. rich city people want nice place settle &amp; yard long haul. Wtf u talking about? locked stretch imagination. Elon musk said virus would gone April. Reddit made libleft weed smoking meme idol, never actually that. He's talented, intelligent ruthless businessman. common practice try avoid screaming childbirth ""upsets baby"" places, long even covid. many years come ACA alternative still nothing?

They utterly incompetent actually governing. Elon musk said virus would gone April  would you. know there, around greenhouses nurseries pushing expanded delivery phone ordering direct local. might able get plants delivered phone call What’s favorite planet? Mine’s sun Who's enough shit patronising articles? Well happens (even though rare 20) - take precautions. need scare.

Plus, reads ""secondary infection"". totally COVID's fault. YMCA’s Camp High Harbor Lake Burton...just read another article 

This assume school reopening go. Yikes. Elon musk said virus would gone April. mean we're equally shit?

I think stretching defend coming across level moral ambiguity would allow argue Elon Hitler exactly level bad. Intelligent. Mentally emotionally. guy stand dude. Hands down. Unfortunately might end martyr around sick congresspeople refuse masks, may way see change. Every time pull them, feet sink towards ground. It’s kinda ironic coming someone designed operating systems...

Someone remind me, Bill Gates get degree Virology?

Edit: Funny speaking truth hypocrisy leads massive downvotes people claim “intellectual” Well nice body age. know runs 4miles every morning?! would love see Dr. Fauci calendar could give grandmother gift! Real estate industry propoganda. unemployment + extra runs places closed ever reopen, homes market prices fall. industry trying make money market swings downward. Yep, start it, running grocery felt like supply run walking dead! biggest Elon fanboy this. like great friend found beating dog. Fuck that. trust Fauci. says Hydroxycloroquine scam believe him. Elon musk said virus would gone April. Yup, followed answer “isn’t true XXX,XXX number children tested positive?” showing made another ridiculous statement. stop reading covid news Fridays. depressing. ""Public Servant"" make people rich af. Swear god system broken top bottom, needs scrapped/revamped. Yup! Im housekeeper judgements appeared much better high ups making decisions. rather, housekeepers must expendable dont care. we're short staffed areas getting sanitized properly. asked managers February planned staffing pandemic already low staffed. responded "" virus wont come here."" already community spread city 2 hours us. could better insight? don’t disagree this, I’ve watched someone shouting wearing “muzzle” shop. ever get control sorts around. Elon musk said virus would gone April. Weird phrasing, sounds like Covid crept beds got like Jason something. face FACTS: **Mandates work.** Maybe small towns 🤷‍♀️ Everyone read Merchants Doubt Conway Oreskes Shock Doctrine Naomi Klein. Seriously. want understand lobbyists disseminate false information sway public opinion benefit big business interests (oil, tobacco, etc.) crisis used interests get want, books. correct parent state’s Facebook group insisted dry cough symptom COVID. Mind blowing people Russia living long enough affected Covid measurable number!? contact tracing anonymous? assuming every cough covid stupid. live next door business reclassified restaurant. people cannot smoke inside anymore. also 11PM curfew, places like getting around order *shut bars*. clearly said denounces china genocide.. read lol. like denounce America slavery praise defeating Nazi Germany, critical things like Go Nats! since story CBS FOX information original comment, i'm gonna say ship probably sailed already Yeah makes lot sense refi gonna while. We're moving couple years worth it. inkling market slow reality sets in. Officer big Mac character make comeback! one immediately heard TLC title?  Budweiser exist - air sheeple!  first public schools state started opening already! unified federal approach would made response much better idea soon change research conducted. 

Infected children have least much coronavirus noses throats as infected adults, according research. Indeed, children younger age 5 may host 100 times much virus upper respiratory tract adults, authors I'm gonna get vaccines rest life? virus Gates knows digital kind Unless initial vaccines extreme low end efficacy, probably get back something looks normal within months mass vaccination campaign. unlucky would continue get sick even fewer would die, numbers hospitalizations deaths low justify continuation social distancing business lockdowns. can’t live 300,000 dead per year, live 10,000 dead per year.

In scenario, COVID would never eradicated, would occupy mindshare polio measles, don’t think unless we’re one affected it. fact first thing see source reads ""we fact-check stories posted here"", second information two months date bode well. 

While information may accurate, question information posted instead or, perhaps, NEJM, CDC website itself.

COVID-19 shown cause [MISC-C children ages know contagious viruses similar effects, influenza viral pneumonia. 

The fact remains, children risk. Yes, higher chance surviving, bowl 100 skittles front you, 1 covered toxin would kill you, would risk grabbing handful? Would let child? would pass it. safe open schools though, right? Like, there's way virus actually spread people close proximity may may desire or, states, requirement wear mask. much dealing reality virus met magical thinking large groups people. Like thinking we'll vaccine ready end year. It’s reasons, business “normal” shelves empty inventory shortages sales wouldn’t *doubled* vs last year.

Send everyone home work + give $1200 free money = LETS GO SHOP!  wait December January (post Thanksgiving / Christmas). both. heated words Governor ours... literally fucking it. 

Then re-opened surprise, cases, less deaths... panic.

I fucking get it. ALWAYS expected? ALWAYS goal? never going eradicate this.  tigers spread rona. vote send da bears. done, fail see point here. thought argument fact Bill Gates fact somewhat experienced Viruses such, whereas Elongated Musket isn't.... seem agreeing me. I'm sure complete one off

Can’t increasing corona virus cases don’t let anyone see counts! understand this.

Or maybe understand this. See making shit up. Back then, ~impossible buy PPE Amazon.

It not. look right things. brought receipts, case could, back day, chance 2-pack masks local Home Depot. stopped government.

Ultimately was, mess. quite while, people still buying there. Including lots medical order pallets. 2-pack Home Depot disrupt them.

In early phase, hospitals went order found get timely fulfilled. ran out. medical professionals scrambling buy masks retail home project stores, paint stores, industrial shops. Amazon. interesting see happens bank loans insurance rates restaurants similar businesses. Marine sure, live mostly brackish zone, Jesus me?  Wouldn’t cases go back reopening? would different last time? one store come assist poor lady lying floor? That’s heartbreaking. Yeah definitely odd individual school zero contact school open fully. Goddard generally credited invented modern rocket 1926. 1971 NASA landed rocket Moon, NASA employees got drove around electric car.

Recovering first stage considered since 1960s, demonstrated DC-X 1990s. problem then, now, math. need high flight rate willingness suffer payload penalty. Yup. 'nt BIL. Super smart, makes $150,000 year thinks moon hollow man made. Said rings like bell. Proven fact tells me. Also thinks hoax almost 80 year old man hoax get rich guessing thinks concubines Virgin Islands.  early! disagree? ""This exactly people deny seriousness COVID-19 feel, please fall trap, went opposite conclusion.""

I get sure. thing 100% conflicting conclusions every day. conclusions seas local, seemingly reputable outlets sources. next impossible get reliable information point. amazing gotten along time information gotten blurry.

The trap I'm stepping since can't know true, better take path leads less spread. know, 100%, less contact leads less infection. studdy saying ""while children less likely spread (...) classroom setting, likely get teacher (..) spread families."" another saying ""kids can't spread it.""  another saying ""kids spread faster."" right option choose? obvious seems isolate more, since a) one thing know works, b) least spread studies correct, c) option least spread contagious virus cost delay staggered opening.

I realize burden placed parents students delaying school year. also realize cost associated accepting scientific papers. thing conflicting science, time peer review, still need make choice. seems making choice least spread going safer. Ie, can't ""un spread"" virus. send children back school month turns safe. talking amputating arms something, sure might make choice harder. simply adding option remote learning? Ez choice even without information.

If want couch scientific language call probability theory, expected value, game theory etc. things deal making choices incomplete information seem applicable current situation. Agree 100%. Florida locked completely, cases deaths would still rise weeks, tapering around 3 week mark. That's Spain level lockdown. go away magically. FTC also America entire history. don’t know much I’m Inclined believe it’s effective safe. vaccine doesn’t pop fast. I’ve kept tabs Oxford seems super close break through. must go human trials. Also nobody knows long term effect vaccine. law, would passed state legislature, shows signs interested so. He’s always confused apparently. makes cult supporter much confusing. even care? even says wont disappear even bother fighting it. losing battle. Stop shutdowns quarantine reopen country. Weve suffered long enough. one died prison heatstroke yet? I'm New Orleans car AC. Whenever get stuck traffic, feel heat stroke coming on. keep 12 pack water + Hydorflask car times. 

It really dangerous people prison AC. okay stupid people dying wish fuckstick claims ""it's big deal"" would spend week COVID 19 ward without PPE. 

Tell friend lost 60 year old mother grandkids never really met grandma.  bonus check, people need actually helping out. give free money people spend steak dinner? Problem rate transmission parameter (R) like things, statistically calculated, low number cases anyway, small swing, generally considered outlier, make big difference stuff completely agree. many parents grandparents spread to? kids may survive health complications, vulnerable spread to? coronaviruses also present short-term effects impacting multiple organ systems well? Given population 60 million, that's really good. Sweden's around 300 cases day recently sixth population.

Germany posting well twice numbers Italy is, anywhere near twice population.

In terms large European countries, Italy best close right now.

The fact seeing growth cases concerning though.  remember context is, him, time ever seen someone accept ongoing genocide, accepted fact life.

This shocking thing admit he's obviously absurdly insulated discussion history current events. stop resisting Fred Rogers died cancer, made television children, early childhood spoke often stuffed animals  forgot /s ... oh, wait serious. think quite shows infected. There's book it: problem done generations mostly OK it.  writing -- folks sitting school boards select approve textbooks controls that. plenty historians who'd write frankness history books local/state school boards would buy use books. He’s falsified injuries workers countless times. That’s call “Filthadelphia”. Looks like downvoted hell. obviously many people besides politicians believe it. seems forgotten damn trump voters, make around half whole country. confident normal sure, believe could potentially necessary amount people vaccinated Feb 2021, maybe even earlier knows. guess it’s pussible... That’s inaccurate- children spread virus well adults; infections generally mild tend undetected upvoted every comment including yours. agree moral views influences progress point profit numbers perspective, matter. point view right, human perspective brings positive change. someone sued helping incorrect. say, great example schools open. Kids seem efficient carrying spreading virus. full lies. don’t even live Sweden. earth would 4K come from? mini strike, due unhealthy work conditions, put days behind. Combined 30% increase trash people stay home more. Combined increase workers calling sick going think safely maintain tourism international trade risks they'll make tough decisions sure. That's irresponsible way start can't pay monthly payments already. think job secure, mean due unpredictability today's climate. economy crash worse current rate. True - flat 50 milkweed planted spring takes quite bit space! Hopefully next march we’ll back lot less risk browse see neat things available - things don’t survive tender mercies. gardenias blueberries rather mad me, lol. owners actually wanted bubble scenario 2 field cities. players association threw caution wind. Florida passed peak cases. percent positive flat several weeks. R(t) less 1.

The deaths lagging catch next week. 250 deaths per day state 21 million hardly enough reason impose drastic measure. Shutdowns literally possible extreme response. South Jersey resident here.  NJ shut major toll highways passenger traffic. Commercial trucks could permitted. Close port authority bridges. health worker front lines, hospital coordinate travel respective port authority, turn pike commission etc. 

Jersey government people know Jersey best. defer federal government? He’s many outright lies it’s silly. reddit cult still praises like idol though. Wait conspiracy theory anymore? falsified case numbers? fInD sOmEtHiNg NeW!!!11! close enough. cross immunological response. guess I'm worried catching much I'm imposing risking safety. I'm pretty sure want there. 
Also knowing what's changed go general. anxiety appointments.  country sick ways one. Democrats passed bill House opted fighting.

Genuinely, party member, would shut it. I'd leak McConnell's private number. I'd fight dirty.

The Repubs wasted trillions ACA repeals went where. lot politicians die trivial hills obsessed.

I guess need get us politicians look us way look profit health care. Ohio rep determined make political possible  I’ve this. Fair warning optics swimming goggles weird since it’s meant viewed underwater. get little dizzy walking around them. Never drank day week pandemic, like get bored grab beer fridge. Sherrifs arbitrarily unilaterally decide enforce certain laws? Welcome Germany 1933 Also, statistics story cast lot doubt idea children spread virus.

They put 600 children together, tested 344 them, around **75%** tested positive. seem practical could adults spreading virus children (especially since camp staff wore masks). Completely unrelated, Chargers fan, find odd used picture 10 years old story...before optimism gone 😄 set foundations funds research viruses, including ones Malaria seem remember one highest killers Africa. read, takes huge interest furthering research development vaccines help build better lives people - takes personal interest many projects inside foundations actually knows doing. Elon claims want : build better future yet come world. Yep. We're cooking lot eating lot less, we're getting better cooking too. Sorry late response. got chance read that. Theres lot holes argument. need PPE? PPE shortage anymore, get masks gloves everywhere now. symptoms right get tested anywhere country. Theres way would ever able get enough tests reopen scenario, logistically impossible. assessment fully reopening would save economy also highly subjective. doubt many people would skeptical going people wearing masks. I've personally going eat restaurants since reopened state. Declaring bars,  restaurants, barber shops, tattoo shops close ridiculous. Lots businesses wouldnt survive another shutdown. Again, shutdown great theory totally doable. Wrong. According every single mask mandate country. 

If afraid, you’ll stay home. trying tell Senators Congressmen? Oh wait CDC NIH lied us again? surprise. thought ""partially airborne"" whatever f means. Maybe see call sick first week. honestly think schools going last much longer that. looked posted Yahoo I'm going lean little bit politics rules, needs reputable news agency. know rules frustrating really want keep sub devolving r/politics clone. Yeah, I’m US. mean, it’s already shit show elections dude WH, it’s going utter chaos. Yo holmes! Smell ya lata! really. vast majority people I've seen wear nose. Good I’ll happily go HD then. 

Trump 2020 :) Bill Gates, stick computers stfu. can’t expect big box retailer staff entire store experts. Dept 1 2 bunch people support grunt work. Ask go people think that?

Can please provide us reasoning behind conclusion? ONE WARNED US never get term “medical bill” wtf blaming players owners? mean, wants improve covid handled doubled bubble Well completely said, maybe edit :) covid cases NZ quarantine since entered country. IE cases NZ. absolutely. Tons factors consider. Improved care would one them. consider time dropping deaths rising cumulative cases, hospitals logged worst patient nurse/doctor ratios. deaths better nurse/doctor ratios. numbers accurate, would mean quality care improved time care received cut half.

Maybe that's true, seems weird. Received email today person cutting hair last weekend tested positive COVID. self quarantine 14 days get tested.

Problem is, arrived grandparent’s last night weekend. definitely leave, right? grandma’s trying guilt staying saying well already exposed Thursday, might well stay now.

BTW self quarantining pretty hard besides cut, always wear mask socially distance. School boards aren’t qualified make decisions. medical professionals staff. Yeah exactly. fucking nice live good country. Corona history months now. Might conflict interest press owned people lifestyles stake state shuts down. I'd think press would blaring ""shutdown now"" non stop. funny confidently almost completely wrong. ton evidence Musk closely involved rocket design, particularly Falcon 1. 

He's let fame wealth go head epidemiological expert, point devalues argument wrong. part equation though. Surely parents taking extreme precautions child came home parents clue child carrying COVID normal interactions? ""Look like crabs, talk like people!"" I’m referring top post time sub comments top rated post. almost health insurance important public good leave profit-motivated free market solve. So, saying moron know read vaccine trials, many extremely promising date? remember people like back earlier parts year, oddly enough people gone silent.. Hope they're still alright.. considered getting downvoted inane shit vomiting nothing Chinese genocide statement paste randomly comments? four months assemble better policy.

They one now. I'm skeptical UV thing anyway. virus exposed time die, happen flies UV light duct. told Facebook experts northeast outbreaks reached herd immunity due 40% people innate immunity form common cold 60% already infected. 

I wonder wrong tests really juiced Bill Gates, Fauci, Democratic Party's vast international network. guess we'll never know unless keep searching truth.

/s least Gates knows listen disease experts organization. People like musk think gut instinct expertise. Right. “may” possible places, we’re talking worldwide. concede Canada can’t, that’s saying. learn live this. doesn’t mean stopping we’re doing, that’s integral living vs fire like neighbours south. Common sense overshadowed arrogance. Except really is. That's thing geniuses, they're often spectrum. Let's say brains developed much better average directions. clearly issues, saying cannot possibly brain behind SpaceX ignorant. said dumb stuff things idea about, true rolled eyes tweets, feeling second hand embarrassment. one would think SOMEONE, anti-Musk news reporter example, would find proof Musk really Chief Engineering. is. understand people assume CAN'T brain there, would totally understand guy PhD Rocket Engineering brain. think much one learn working top engineers SpaceX 18(!) years. Compare time takes get PhD, really regularly working real stuff goes space. Listen interviews Elon, listen talking technical details SpaceX designs decision-making. big changes introduced ideas (like switching steel Starship) there's really good reason doubt were. guess best one hating Elon. ;)

It's kind ridiculous people ok calling dozens people lived last 1000 years geniuses, today, education common many educated people alive, can't see even obvious ones them. Geniuses Messiahs. real. Geniuses good do, compensated areas.  Wait minute. Now. wanted ask people maybe tests done. Thinking getting Covid-19 test done nervous it. I've heard somewhat painful. seen ENT doctors multiple occasions though like many Nasal Scope ENT doctor puts camera nose. Given know nose numbed Covid-19 test.

You wrong this. Fullstop. agree understand feelings. I'd encourage focus local life let national news drag down. makes sad, too, hand region county done great job crushing curve, people still following guidelines. know live, can't control people side country, people likely give covid negligence. Focus control life Fauci said study flawed wouldn’t endorse better study. Nothing wrong.

Which invested company right thing. It’s public health issue.

So, again, want address public health issues, solution join striking workers ensuring needs addressed satisfactorily.

Hiring replacements going solve public health issue workers literally saying working environment public health pay it

You angry company taking money providing safe working conditions.  know saying, I'm 50, math adds up, I'm confused angry now. Elon musk alt right piece shit What? saying doctors are... info same. difference make hear Bill Gates instead Dr fauci, they're saying exact thing. Jim Jordan plague humanity.

then sit down, this. would politically toxic admit it, strategy. Wow! Talk prescient! Despite government leaders might believe, there's guarantee military, also humans families supposed fighting protect countrymen, would willing comply orders use jets tanks people.

The military might commit violence, especially people effectively demonized enough anarchists 'not true citizens' actions, there's least halfway decent chance won't.

I understand there's Federal National Guard arresting people Portland like, arresting (and hurting individuals non-lethal weapons) much lower level scale awful 'drop bombs shoot tanks people'.

Again saying impossible, also possible enough people military flip sides go government (which happened countries) given terrible order, point government revealed completely powerless.

Translation: 

Sweden closure reopening countries, yet corona crisis left mark. still signs crisis mood linger long time side Sound. Unemployment risen sharply consumers reluctant.


The reopening Europe means economies crawling corona darkness. Denmark Norway, seems domestic economy moving relatively fast. Sweden never closed therefore positive effect reopening. theory, give softer course, economy avoids big fluctuations up. reality, Sweden followed course home connection closure: less use public space, lots do-it-yourself projects homes.

Already earlier Danish reopening process, signs Swedes lagging bit behind - economy flatter early summer months compared home. even signs Swedish economy may experience prolonged crisis domestic economy, addition cyclical exports.

Swedish consumers lost breath bit. Thus, consumer confidence fell July 84.1 83.3. huge decline - Danish consumer confidence also weak side July marginal increase - current level optimism points decline private consumption.

The decline primarily due negative view Swedish economy less desire buy larger consumer goods. Swedes' fears unemployment hit highest level since financial crisis - fallen since spring. often means consumers become reluctant save more. Already first quarter, savings rate rose highest least 40 years.

It already clear consumption weak way corona crisis. Retail sales rose well enough one percent June, nothing compared Denmark Norway. Since beginning year, retail sales Sweden increased one percent, correspondingly seven percent higher Denmark 15 percent higher Norway.

 
#Exploding unemployment

A large part explanation must probably found Swedish labor market. April, new wage compensation scheme (short-term layoffs) introduced, proved overwhelmingly popular. 570,000 people covered scheme, 180,000 Stockholm, corresponds 18 percent workforce. three counties, 20 percent workforce sent home way. National Institute Economic Research, KI, expects average 450,000 people covered scheme last three quarters year.

**However, prevented unemployment rising explosively 9.3 per cent, tangent level financial crisis. Unemployment already risen KI expected June forecast . Among people born Sweden, unemployment rate 19 percent.**

 
The weak labor market already taken hold wage formation, rate increase monthly wages declining 1.4 per cent April. lowest wage increase measured least 30 years - otherwise par inflation. manual workers, increase hourly wages almost disappeared. combination declining employment weak wage increases means household purchasing power fallen. reinforces expectation continued weak private consumption.

The weakness domestic economy exacerbated exports, far cyclically sensitive home. Danish exports goods 12 per cent lower May beginning year, high 21 per cent Sweden. Swedish exports rose nicely June, companies' assessment export orders risen markedly looks far better home. However, much depend global economic developments later year, prospects United States particular bleak.

#Swedish prospects unclear

There decisive signs weakness Swedish economy seriously waning activity Swedish economy fell four months February May.

Business confidence risen spring levels, industry begins approach normal recession, service sector remains low level bottom financial crisis. Even retail sector weak. Google's indicator population mobility shows increase Swedish visits shops leisure activities five percent since end May. Denmark, increase almost 30 percent period.
 
The summer season without foreign tourists, especially hits Stockholm's economy hard, also many Swedes regions stay away due relatively high infection rates. latest statement Statens Serum Institut shows 29 new infected per. 100,000 inhabitants per week, corresponding figure 11 Scania.

Construction also still characterized variety view, also reflection construction boom 2013 2017. Companies' investments production equipment declining since 2017.

**The latest forecast European Commission points decline year's activity Denmark Sweden five percent. still many uncertainties outlook Danish economy coming months, seems Swedish recovery even dubious.** low turnout provides evidence system broken. People know vote matter. say get downvoted. new measles hear news random city Disney park responsible outbreak due visit anti-vaxxers. People fight back forth anti-vaxxer. Muslim? evangelical Christian? hippy? highest confirmed estimate i'm seeing around 200k end september

Intentionality nothing it. Ever heard negligence? Many lawsuits without intentionality ever discussed. feel sorry you.  hard time understanding America’s wage slave labor force killed off. feels deliberate. give another day He’s kinda like trump someone would take phone away, people would lot respect article discusses way pandemic affected economy. Please read commenting. Also, Denmark attempting suppress recent uptick cases via TTI expanded recommendations masks (two things Sweden and/or well) likely successful. Huh? Toyota opened 13 North American plants week GM, Ford, Fiat Chrysler Tesla.

Elon force anyone anything. fact, said email workers “you feel uncomfortable coming back work time, please feel obligated so,” unnecessary.  It’s so, sad. saw China ran point shutdown would reduce infection rate back point actually identify hot spots use contact tracing send *those* people two week home isolation everybody else go back halfway normal life. least that's way worked european countries. Argentina proper shutdown/strict quarantine since beginning still covid new cases haven’t flattened curve Yep. varies widely county nowhere near getting control. guys done great job.

If coughing normal, a-ok?
Or maybe, bear here, goddamn pandemic extra careful coughing.....
Your nursing assistant associates degree allowed opine coughing symptom multiple diseases.  Congratulations. knew?!?! think next time continuing lunacy... personally think rich enough go bug compound New Zealand, forced BACK line US vaccine access. People trapped leadership deserve protection first.

In reality know it’s trump extended family demand two scoops vaccine first stockpile first ICU nurse gets any. soon bosses get vaccinated, assitance protections get cancelled regardless many months actual vaccination take. 

I fear worst wave last wave come get news vaccine coming know works. People euphoric chomping bit normalcy fail process vaccine treatment, mere existence world vaccinated. People act like soon told over. Ok go north jersey start telling complete strangers put mask on. See happens. can’t real world. It’s right wrong. downvoted someone political agenda reality that's SAD.

Yep. There's unfortunately large brigade defend Swedish strategy downvote everything casts negative light. truly sad indeed. Watch main post probably go zero (they tend focus trying suppress submission itself). Occasionally posts break downvote brigade, guess one better chance many since midnight Swedish time.

ETA: seems like post somewhat escaped downvote brigade. Makes sense since almost 0130 Sweden many sleeping. anyone curious see brigading looks like, check [recent post submissions Sweden almost heavily downvoted. hard data now: really get pick ""economy public health"" get pick ""shitty economy"" ""shitty economy PLUS sick nation"". Sweden went option two. America largely well. :(

Yep again. actually [indications 1918](http://news.mit.edu/2020/pandemic-health-response-economic-recovery-0401) data pandemic well. actually even since shown Nordic region, many ways [Denmark's economic recovery stronger since Denmark mostly supressed outbreak (although recent concerning uptick cases). 

But yeah, poor US really doldrums terms burden infection economy. feel badly it. :( End year October, November December  Climate change plus black roads draw heat sun. fly small airplane actually like 70 degrees f 500ft tests=no virus /s  really hope not, hanging right now.

31/07/2020, Hong Kong number confirmed cases going three figures nine days row new peak 149 new cases 30/07/2020. outbreak situation going critical, 200 patients still waiting hospitalised despite Hong Kong's public health system already operating maximum capacity. response, Hong Kong based fangcang hospital: AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility open doors patients Saturday 01/08/2020.

Per reporting Ta Kung Pao night 30/07/2020, Secretary Food Health Dr Sophia Chan Siu-chee Director Health Dr Constance Chan travelled Shenzhen meet mainland officials discuss reinforcement mainland testing kits manpower expanding Hong Kong's testing capacity, particularly targeting high risk groups full population test.

On 30th, Hong Kong 149 new confirmed cases COVID-19, accumulative 3152 confirmed cases. Currently across 16 public hospitals quarantine facilities remain 1168 confirmed cases. publishing pandemic situation update 30th, Chairman Hospital Authority Henry FAN Hung Ling explained 270 patients moved second line isolation rooms, Lei Yue Mun Park Holiday Village Isolation Facility 162 patients stable conditions, 200 patients still waiting hospitalised. AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility beings operation reduce waiting time patients.

According TV interview Dr Li Liye Tin Shui Wai Hospital Accident &amp; Emergency Department 31/07/2020, AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility completed preparation begin accept patients Saturday 01/08/2020.

According Dr Li Liye, patients going AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility eventually divided three categories: first asymptomatic, inflammation X-ray imagining. patients show symptoms fever 2-3 days may transferred Lei Yue Mun Park Holiday Village Isolation Facility. Second category symptoms fever, treated AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility, condition worsen transferred public hospital isolation ward. Category three unstable blood pressure, short breath, lung inflammation, immediately transferred public hospitals treatment.

Dr Li Liye said initially use No. 1 exhibition area AsiaWorld-Expo, expected 500 beds enough room separate patient area medical staff rest area. patients already confirmed positive risk transmission patients free move around two resting areas. Dr Li Liye also said patient test positive antibody signals longer infectious discharged. change discharge critera average number days hospital patients decrease 20 days 16 17, thus improve turnover rates hospital beds.

On 25th, Chief Executive Carrie Lam published long article facebook explaining Hong Kong crasp large scale community transmission. SAR government treating utmost urgency continue intensify countermeasures confidence Hong Kong able overcome virus. also mentioned Central Government highly concerned Hong Kong's outbreak pandemic prevention efforts, recently provided support increasing test capacity establishing fangcang hospitals AsiaWorld-Expo Treatment Facility.

Hong Kong Macau Affairs Office speaksperson said 27th, due rapid spread virus, Hong Kong's testing, health isolation capabilities longer able meet demand. Many general public Hong Kong expressed hope Central Government provide support Hong Kong. SAR government also expressed request Central Government. According Hong Kong Macau Affairs Office, Central Government highly concerned health safety Hong Kong compatriots support provide help requests SAR government. Particular areas improving testing capacity, building new isolation facilities treatment centres prevent spread.

Hong Kong Liaison Office speaksperson spoke 26th, Central Government highly concerned Hong Kong COVID-19 outbreak health safety Hong Kong people, provide support requests made SAR government. speaksperson stressed saving lives urgent fighting fire. Central Government closely monitor pandemic situation Hong Kong closely coordinate SAR government provide support needed. Central Government hope entire society follow leadership Chief Executive SAR government endure overcome hardship achieve victory battle virus.  Chinese ripoff China. China actually fights virus control. Quarantine work enforced people find loopholes. example, NY, NJ CT said people coming Florida quarantine 14 days. People began flying PA (which travel restrictions) driving NY, NJ CT. None states checkpoints highways checking state visitors. Also people follow voluntary quarantine penalties strict enough. High fines thousands jail time would help. China broke quarantine back January peak. They'd drag force spend quarantine jail cell. Could quarantined comfort hotel home get jail. didn’t lie, NEW virus tested discover new things it. mean could vaccinated first go around high risk enough

Vaccinated everyone mentioned fall going bring aspects normalcy back low level didn't. lie.

They said ""There conclusive evidence transfer Human-to-Human."" say inverse, conclusive evidence transfer Human-to-Human.

""I proof Steve killed Bob."" ""I proof Steve kill Bob."" First official death. mean, I’m actively performing research virus (or rather proteins interact it), count? I’ll always know visionary architect Hammond Druthers Met Mother. school announced we’re going back August. I’ve seen 5 posts week peers either house parties reunions without mask sight. I’m fucked ""YOU want keep talking 75 years ago. talking happening TODAY.

 really insane hypocrisy two us, exact sentence replying keeping talking it, one saying anything 75 years ago. never mentioned anything 75 years ago keep going me.

*Now deleted posts embarrassment badly fucked entire conversation up, recognise future argue people supposed responding say. fails state whether that's 92% accuracy positive cases not.

You could probably stand street point 100 people say none coronavirus similarly accurate. technically though, say much want. Can't even enforce masks, one going wear goggles face shields lol would legitimately disown never associate family thought Trump genius. okay support monster like him. kids go school, go gym, get haircuts, drink, go beach. voting line gets drawn.. ridiculous.  least Sweden something it. Meanwhile, Denmark loosening protective measures despite fact active cases doubled recently, they've largest increase number corona infections Denmark single day since 18 ....Sarah Gilbert already favorite person, find THREE IDENTICAL TRIPLETS STUDYING ALSO BECOME KICKASS SCIENTISTS? &lt;3 That’s sounds like. Per actual policy:


ANY STUDENT STAFF IDENTIFIED CLOSE CONTACT POSITIVE COVID-19 CASE (currently close contact someone within 6 feet 15 minutes someone confirmed COVID-19, regardless whether cloth face covering used not)
• Quarantine 14 days returning school. Must remain symptom-free. individual develops symptoms, refer symptomatic scenarios referenced above.
• identified close contact consult healthcare provider guidance regarding testing desks 6’ apart sounds like time anyone meet criteria possibly lunch, didn’t look food policy. Hopefully they’re diligent least consider students seated adjacent front infected student close contacts, I’ve really lost lot faith people right thing steal people’s money bank accounts... talking stealing business.... that’s happens people prefer see covid outbreak preventable natural disaster.

I think preventable think is. think lockdowns way less think, think way unknown factors deciding outcome different countries simplistic ""lockdown + masks = stopping it"".

If want completely kill virus country, there's super simple solution: Order everyone indoors five weeks, call military bolt doors shut, patrol streets hazmat suits, shoot everyone goes outside. prevents covid-19 deaths. Ta-daa.

But we're that, obviously, cost solution high. country *everything* stop particular cause death. Instead, balance, we're trying choose lesser evil. Thinking there's way escape pandemic unscathed like flood killed 5000 people

5000 dead adults children healthy people complete disaster. that's demographics covid-19 dead look like. dead old sick close statistical death. Grandma dying half year earlier instead disaster. unexpected. family-destroying unimaginable horror. *good*, bad sad family losing someone, that's life looks like.

And point first graph posted thread. We've periods deaths worse year, flu seasons lots old people died, give single shit past decades. No-one wrote breathless news articles wearing mask killing grandma back 1993. fucking ignored it.

And that's I'm tired people staring blind single cause death, without looking bigger picture. better also attempted suppress 3 week long upward trend by, say, removing existing protective measures? Seems like logical thing me.

But sure, wanna stick economic bit time, Denmark's gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 1.9 per cent first quarter compared corresponding quarter last year, according updated seasonally adjusted figures country's statistics office.  Olsen, chief economist Danske Bank, describes one largest GDP races Denmark ever.  second quarter, Olsen expects Denmark's GDP fall significantly more, 5–6 per cent.

 

Is Denmark opening despite recent surge cases? look better economically? Better ""stumble"" continue recover like Sweden's doing.  doomsday circlejerk unnecessary. Covid-19 even extremely deadly disease, there's reason treat like apocalypse. much worse pandemics understanding medicine. point could actually done something impact permanently. write payroll costs go back less stellar wages.

Swedish tourism sales SEK 337 billion 2018, according Swedish Agency Economic Regional Growth. year expected significantly lower. travel agency industry alone estimates year's sales trips abroad plummet 10-20 billion, normal 60-70 billion per year.

- Many companies risk going bankrupt thousands employees become unemployed, says Didrik von Seth continues:

- great disaster entire travel industry. prepared receive tourists Sweden sell travel. complete silence, causes great losses, Sweden throughout Europe.

Big loss popular Sweden 

Sweden popular tourist destination Europe. normal summer, foreign guests account 9.9 million guest nights hotels, cottages, hostels campsites. 2018, foreign tourists consumed SEK 144 billion Sweden. since March year, situation different.
- Bookings hotels campsites much lower foreign tourists. also know many actually complete bookings exist, says Jonas Siljhammar, CEO Visita, industry employer organization Swedish hospitality industry.

Holidays Sweden

Many Swedes place hopes holidays Sweden, also benefits certain industries. Holiday rentals increasing, sales holiday homes hotter. Motorhomes caravans increasingly demand. 

In 2018, Swedish visitors' consumption amounted SEK 193 billion. **But according industry employer organization Visita's CEO Jonas Siljhammar, also see bookings Swedish tourists year.**

- many places, summer absolutely crucial survival. When, example, Storsjöyran Östersund canceled, situation becomes serious. life's work risks collapsing, says Jonas Siljhammar.

Visita also estimates around 25,000 summer jobs disappear hotels, restaurants amusement parks empty summer, addition permanent jobs already disappeared also risk disappearing.

I think fall get masks tho. hope importance wearing masks spreading rhetoric instead science based advice finally hit home.

Sadly, individuals still support Trump research believe whatever hear. words, truely IGNORANT CHOICE. May suggest children's ""germy behaviour"" would still lead infections, even covid-19 aresol transmitted? Kids get closer adults do, scream inside, sneeze cough without covering mouths, make serious things games etc etc. can't ""blame"" kids, saying behaviour exacerbate problem isnt right.

At school March, kids told play touch games socially distance. kids invented new game called ""Virus"". person who's ""in""(fected) coughs hand purposely, chases kids around trying infect them. Real fun game, thought hilarious. Unfortunately that's exact kind thing adults never stop kids - they're kids play, spread infections without realising it.  Loan deferments eviction moratums end tomorrow. May happen sooner think. European perspective, can‘t find words dystopic nightmare comparison know. agree statement general, particular virus strange. daycares montessories world stayed open throughout pandemic, including US hotspots (daycare considered essential service, unlike school), data points much lower covid infection transmission rate among kids 5. yet single confirmed child teacher transmission age group. Don’t ask that’s case kids age seem super vectors viruses illnesses, that’s data saying far. Oh touch everything. Either hands, mouth, feet, whatever. Nothing come reason, sneeze, cough vomit you. 

Sigh, it’ll goddamn shit show. seem forget there’s guarantee immunity infection. go. Let's frank guy ignorant. knew wrong, getting people killed, effectively menace society telling FLAT LIES leading many readers dying. care lying sells made company money.

They care many bodies pile, care make money it. There's reason doctor shopping thing US. certain providers get pretty much prescription want. Remember sales Oxycontin skyrocketed? think that's suddenly increase pain patients? No, doctors prescribing more. medication dubious health results become global phenomenon. people actually desperate, want whatever ""cure all"" hear about. see increase.

This support Remdesivir, I'm highly skeptical well. Jag har också sett varje presskonferens (de kl14:00), och jag tycker att de har varit extremt tydliga med att strategin inte är flockimmunitet utan att plana ut kurvan. Förstår inte hur det har tolkats så?

Vad dom sagt är att strategin är att plana ut kurvan så att hälsovården kan klara av att ta hand om de sjuka. Detta då smittan inte kommer att försvinna, utan vi kommer behöva leva med den en längre tid. Vi planar ut kurvan genom att hålla smittotalen nere och skydda riskgrupperna.

Sedan har folk (journalister) frågat hur länge vi ska hålla på med detta typ och då har de svarat ”ja vi behöver göra detta tills det finns en immunitet befolkningen och den uppnås antingen genom vaccin eller att en såpass stor andel av befolkningen blir smittade”.(extremt fritt parafraserat). Är det detta svar som förvirrat?

Och sen att Tegnell sagt 10 gånger att vi kommer ha det lättare, det har väl inget med strategin att göra? Naaah, way. immunity Covid-19 get again. infection exponentially worse previous. much, little. nice, controlled burn. dont talk politics, good news regards coronavirus make racist Wait, watch video?

Edit - Also love hearing international opinions. Welcome good friend.  believe Oxford showed presence antibodies week need month reaching full protection, can't remember that's booster without. Archive link: lack rapid tests covid-19 healthcare Stockholm. care facility given ration certain number tests per day. reason supplier halved deliveries Stockholm region.

- cannot test much would liked, says Johan Styrud, chief physician Danderyd Hospital.

Since supplier Cepheid decided halve deliveries Stockholm Region, shortage so-called pcr rapid tests covid-19 healthcare.

- supplier announced short notice reduce delivery Stockholm Karolinska region, ie week, says Kim Sjölund, press manager Karolinska University Hospital.

The tests provide answer ongoing infection two four hours used healthcare Stockholm pandemic spring. also forms tests response time 12 72 hours.

An internal document Stockholm Region states Danderyd Hospital use 39 rapid tests per day. Södersjukhuset ration 40 rapid tests per day, Karolinska Huddinge Solna share 70 rapid tests every day.

The new directives suspected covid cases need emergency inpatient care given priority. rapid tests must used scheduled patients.

According Johan Styrud, chief physician Danderyd Hospital chairman Stockholm Medical Association, rapid test enough test everyone want. present, may make probability assessment whether patient wearing covid-19 not.

The fact hospital opportunity test quickly greater extent means risk admitting covid patient regular ward increases, says Johan Styrud.

- previously tested offensively. little selective.

Styrud says shortage rapid tests throughout spring, become apparent now. perceives difficult assess patients covid-19 symptoms diffuse. tested people hospital, tenth positive virus.

Styrud believes would optimal hospitals able test people seeking care could minimize risk spreading hospital.

- 10 percent positive shows test generously. wish could test everyone admitted.

According Kim Sjölund, reason halving company prioritises continents. says availability rapid tests available sufficient patients need tested, monitor situation closely.

**Can imagine buying quick tests another supplier?**

Re: NSW study (which came see anyone else read), think important also mention that:

All people identified ""close contacts"" (which defined 15 minutes close proximity) required self isolate two weeks. worked average 48 students and/or staff per case. NSW Health NCIRS followed contacts determine need testing, revealed 3 confirmed transmissions.

The time period mentioned terms data studied March 5 - April 21st, last transmission identified on. March 23rd government officially advised parents keep children home online learning, schools went two week holiday beginning April 10th. according paper.

The 18 initial cases confirmed cases NSW school system time. cumulative total case count NSW last day study says current 2969, works roughly 1/2500 people. comparison, US cumulative total case count 4,635,000 1/71 people.

So sure seems like worst kind misinformation suggest data shows children somehow transmit virus, opposed transmission stifled identifying cases enough feasible, isolating along 50 closest contacts two weeks, testing aggressively, ultimately advising parents send kids school anyway. correct along would thought it...

Covid Warriors 3rd Q right Ohio here, officially did, too, except business except bars restaurants wanted declare ""essential"" allowed to, health departments backed up. 

If miracle happens get second attempt shutdown, i'm hoping take seriously time. Nothing open except medical facilities, grocery stores/pharmacies, places manufacturing essential supplies. 

I work factory makes expensive paint. produced one small batch hand sanitizer gave local first responders, allowed stay open. prove *could* make essential supplies, would continue to. bullshit. refreshing hot Summer's day. Pointing laughing countries pretty good way end egg face throughout pandemic. Also, amount money claim hospitals get per COVID death like cost administered individual package extra strength Tylenol ER. It’s painfully dumb. virus worse rhan ever cant afford $2 hour everybody risking family's health deliver packages. COME JEFFERY Treating employees well one Amazon’s core principles.

Heard Costco treats employees well. frikken national treasure right there!!! Get well fine sir! work Lowe's well. $2 hour increase one month. given employees bonuses 3 total far one announced August. store seen record breaking sales since start pandemic much almost reaches sales plan year. Unfortunately, management started cutting hours firing seasonal employees. still working minimal coverage yeah lip service keep media backs. Parents absolutely send kids school sick. personally seen times. 

I know sister-in-law pre-school (my daughter cousin went pre-school/VPK) go work. And, look, get it, people go work. However, kid sick, bite bullet take care them. uncomfortable child, exposing everyone center whatever child has. let know cool, got ol', ""Don't tell parent..."" schtick.

This time, getting soon carseat parent, dressed scrubs (I know could something nurse, ya' know...) takes kids vehicle. stop street begins kid looks down. starts blowing chunks. sitting amazement watch parent wipe kids face continue pre-school. rat tattle-tale, sure hell said something went in. insane! dude asked mask give virus lost it. Lmao 1,637 total still bad 980,000 population Oahu.

The mainland much worse almost everywhere. wanting minimize problem, saying still lucky there. would still get bonus increased business even this.

Not every business owner cartoon villain mind. Donald Trump: ""also trust me, let's wait while"" Well, looks like I'll buying power tools lumber Lowe's. Another reason frequent Lowes instead Home Depot [even though prefer HD, better meanwhile grocery corp cut extra pay hourly workers...

because people matter (their slogan)....my ass! Death coronavirus death economy. do. get extra $3 hour I've read articles that's lowball them. I've seen 24, 20, 32. guess depends whether chose scale existing minimums state. Yeah, that's exactly looking for. appreciate you! explanation simple: expert liars, otherwise quite incompetent.  That’s $50,000 per store.  Absolutely.

And locking threads become political nonsense.

Politicians, country, charge public health policy. cannot separate public health policy politics. run small furniture business, three years, confirm NEVER swamped orders. understand 20% Americans crippled needing weekly dialysis 30-50 years would devastate US economy decades. already shrunk THIRD, 10x 2008 - can't afford hurt. got mine taxed 40% bringing $295. 
I would’ve thankful $300 called that. Instead kept saying $500 screw taking away hazard pay new covid cases reported warehouse everyday. Since science start making normative claims? r/NoShitSherlock obvious reason Black Lives Matter protests spread virus much common sense would dictate mass gathering event would, that's nature attends Black Lives Matter protests.

people want admit it, especially sub there's concerted effort pretend virus nothing political leanings, truth almost certain politically left are, likely adhere measures lower spread virus, even something adhering measures lower spread virus (ie protesting). people would attend BLM protest would politically left all. 

So go protest, either mask pick one site. organizer sees without mask told leave. least attempts social distancing. Also outside heat, people around masks. people next carriers, chances getting somewhere around 2.25% without even factoring mask. get it, may even get infected true sense (that manages self-replicate). 

In contrast, Michigan anti-lockdown protests spread virus, wore masks, attempted adhere distancing, took measures stop viral spread. Michigan anti-lockdown protesters *politically right* generally hardcore supporters current admin, right-wing are, *less* likely things prevent viral spread.

The reality Covid-19 fundamentally *political* pandemic, spread natural disaster sense, disaster caused specific policies specific political responses, policies political responses largely align specific political philosophy praxis. Yes, update based two-weeks data still stands two-week data happened month ago. similar list after? going update one-time statement? That's statistics infection tracking works know this. Jim Jordans second Louie ""got corona mask"" Gohmert title dumbest congressman appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Yup. students graduating high school comparing schools look ""how nice"" campus first, fun is, classes/majors offered (which also problem). want options nice things, cost money. students leave campus environment costs still exist. students return ends, there's suggestion consumer mentality ""enjoying college experience"" go away. Campuses changing mindset changing. turn blame student loans, administrators, jobs....it starts us children. teach value things, otherwise problem persist. would beg differ first point. Hate love them, prior event preeminent leader disease. really, many countries worse death rates.

Haha, dude. response disastrous top down. still don’t adequate testing illness spreading unchecked. 

And reason it’s disastrous *because* national leadership maliciously incompetent. Telling “some states better others” **proves it.** 

So looking poor leadership response countries mention — doesn’t prove we’re better. proves we’re still failing. 

Please good day.  rumors going around plateau coming HHS (since took CDC): anyway tell real not? Obv. put past administration curious there's way get data not. know definition facism right?  Sweden also managed contain eliminate spread Alps, China Iran; early sources. evident looking DNA strains sampled Sweden today. early strains present samples anymore. hate say shut down. Lets shift football spring 2020 ready plan. gets better great. Damn, employee gets $100M? Crazy times live One comments story business man black leaders t.rump literally ""RIP (his name)"" got deleted incivil 🤦🏼‍♀️ Hey, calling Redditors ""morons"" acceptable. 
Please civil! - first rule sidebar here.  testing plateaus data fuckery?

This bet. Notice numbers stopped growing predictably hospitals stopped reporting CDC?

Seems like delay test results getting longer longer. Cases almost irrelevant metric now, matters deaths hospital occupancy - know fact Florida reliable about. Literally can’t high flying non-dividend paying growth stock without consistently beating earnings expectations. meeting, beating.

Let’s face it, companies don’t want pay penny keep best workers working. Maybe party offer universal healthcare part platform really stupid enough take Donnie's snake oil? FALL... Man raising canes gave shift managers 1k bonus last paycheck hold press release it. Yes, good compare Sweden Denmark. Denmark around 60is cases reported today (which really bad low 15ish average per day) whereas Sweden reported 304, really good Sweden relatively speaking highs 1000s. 

Sweden spare testing capacity rather opposite problem. many, many links Swedish testing capacity overwhelmed curious learn more, recent example: 

The reality exactly opposite state: Denmark one highest testing capacities world plenty spare. also one lowest positive test %s world.

ETA: although TTI may helped Sweden bit, Denmark TTI since April great success. TTI Sweden mess, health authorities actually changed law allow infected people track contacts, goes directly guidelines tested faile din Denmark months ago (DK changed professional contact tracers lead tracing shortly trying foolish one). major political medical leaders suggesting ""shutdown vaccine""? something see random redditors tweets? 

I would think mentality fringe. Similar 'open everything, virus flu' fringe side. No, number, support gets wobbly, depending specifics. Also look Dr Zelenko regarding fabricated studies HCQ Covid. Hopefully federally prosecuted. HD much better Lowe’s, Lowe’s perfect location. studies, discussing many months ago posts like this: would link comment, since reply expert AMA reddit expert said ""How protect myself? standard rules apply - respiratory virus land surfaces. important impeccable hand hygiene (e.g. alcohol hand sanitizer) given planes airports lots people confined spaces viruses transmitted settings. also important mindful touch face….is incredible frequently done. Also, masks protect uninfected people getting types viruses, people sick, may prevent person transmitting. - Isaac B."" 

and went argue wrong. 

In article linked see magnitudes difference efficacy professional masks ""tea cloths"" short long-term inward activity. outward activity home-made masks showed ""marginal"" improvement (less 25% improvement protection). 

In second article link uses ""cotton plugs"" comparison cotton masks - however nose plugs would protect inhaling nose spreading coughing, breathing speaking big issue COVID-19 - masks used potentially protect others you, others. 

You linked studies use home-made cotton masks examples. Nowadays thousands people using public areas dozens countries. Certainly, scientific studies quick evaluate effect. Well wasn’t obnoxious cunty you. Cheers! Ironically, partly internet get up-to-date medical information. seems disinformation packets travel faster. Exactly. None studies listed combined HCQ zinc. Lol, w people. Ive known people life. news teaches, would've twisted science said god wanted him. Anything siding different you. Stay tuned sub, many exact stories coming least 3 months don’t know thought March, epidemiologists pegged mortality rate anywhere 0.5-2% since Wuhan. 28 days later screwed bc many people think corona hoax One round checks fix 10% unemployment? Weird live Ontario, Canada (population ~15M) 7-day average new cases 123/day, including 76 89 past two days.

This obviously quite low compared places like Florida, Texas, California seen 8, 9, 10K cases/day recently.

Ontario testing around 25,000-30,000 people per day.

You asked numbers showing excess mortality. provided numbers.  


whether excess deaths worth societal point view political discussion don’t want go into. Yup guess going suffer this? Asian-Americans.

Where say that? heard anything remote option available. TCDSB certainly preparing offer distance learning option afaik.

[another Tegnell says: think achieve herd immunity vaccine** health hands. health hands. I'll part. Hopefully yours. That's nutshell buddy fart alligator?  seek deceive, trolling silly incompetent true age definitely think head thats legs 700 die Denmark fine cinder, I'd cry them.

It's certainly hard get way down, one least try removing sustainable restrictions (or instating Denmark none begin with). Sadly enough, seem Danish way.

Also, see background would it. difficulty factors hard test experimentally due variables.

Not variables proper experiment controls, practically willingly expose people deadly virus. Stupidity got us mess, stupidity get us out! Well 16 K ill year, fact go forever changes death rates problems hospital.

It would take 187,5 years get herd immunity pace. 1. know **a lot** people making unemployment before. talking point. true lot people. 


Not higher earners though 600/week make gap states unemployment payment prior salary, lot higher earning house owners previously living paycheck paycheck may shit soon. 


2. unemployment thing absolutely parties faults. can't compromise (like always), even people really need too. Fuck letting us get place go away completely. stupid.

But denying existence country seems bit strange. make Florida repay Federal assistance? continual touting death toll Covid knowing full well counting anyone dies *with* Covid died *of* Covid inflating deaths tallying prior older deaths current deaths perhaps insidiously disingenuous aspects entire affair.

Your generically smug rIgHt sIdE hIsToRy ""OH EM GEE LOVE SCIENCE"" retort needed completely disregard hot takes though.

I really could care less choose live rest life little face diaper. I'm wearing mask, I'm afraid potentially infecting someone else, let alone putting life jeopardy. keep little security political theatre, I'm taking part it. think Rand Paul doctor. Darwinism best. Question scientifically savvy:

I reading article explaining results Oxford shared early trial said vaccine produced double protection antibodies T-Cells, proven safe, yet proven effective. Isn’t fact vaccine produced specific antibodies cells proof it’s effective? else missing definitely prove it’s effective? Statistically it’s unlikely family’s situation. think odds much higher would permanent mental health problems staying shut odds father succumb virus. Besides vaccine never happen would benefit society low-risk people build herd immunity, happy take small risk vulnerable population. wear masks go indoor public spaces course, makes sense daughter time interacting peers in-home play dates. mental health important. Almost died???


“I sick coronavirus quite early on,” added. “My symptoms slight headache, tightness chest lost taste smell. symptoms show different everyone seems.” He’s coming back YAY! :D Honestly awhile (gotta rewatch film), fake cure. I'm pretty sure fake vaccine produce enough real one, something like that. recall main doctor trying warn fake vaccine end. ten year old company produced vaccine yet 


Yep, real Hungarian coronavirus denier Facebook group: 

What think? Vote republican. ""In post, Cranston said “was one lucky ones” mild symptoms.""
This must troll Holy, know asymptomatic people spread virus parent want kids back school, community come together gather resources teachers. mild symptons Hydroxychloroquine even mentioned. Sorry describing America? ask wear mask 20 min grocery shopping literally start killing other. Given I'm young white male, time even get access vaccine, coronavirus largely gone away. OP hell title. 

Mods remove garbage. ad brought US Government. Nonessential 

Shut didn’t say almost died. fact, said mild symptoms. told need wear masks? hear news should’ve wore masks media one told general public they’re backtracking. 2 party political system beginning get nerves. already, local sheriff saying it’s reach power won’t enforce it, pathetic. father center left, came kind epiphany. said hated extreme right left, struck socialist. laid happening bailouts response ""oh, right socialist rich, that's even worse"". live know situation months whilst I've going enjoying life virus free environment.

Yes, that's true. big thing one talking is, go hospital survive, big hospital Bill get. That's tell people, even though insurance, still able afford get virus. Even end hospital short long stay, huge debt pay 20% hundred thousand dollars, double wife. Rush B сука блять ""We never said that!"" one model democratic socialist countries often referred model society hivemind Reddit.

Nothing more, nothing less.  I'm Swedish Sweden fucked sure. neighboring countries much better.

But never point official strategy Sweden go herd immunity. official strategy basically gamble long run afford repeating bunch hard lockdowns instead opted go partial restrictions sustained years necessary.

Looking Norway, Denmark Finland example obviously short hard lockdown would saved thousands lives.

Another issue fact Swedish government much power impose restrictions countries world. Preventing people going outside help force threat legal repercussions something done outside wartime martial law.

So basically article highlighting pervasive idea Sweden going herd immunity international media months now, false. getting old really. Sell moderna good news, buy Pfizer That's even true anymore. keep wrong things screaming unfair nothing works. It’s actually big claim all. Maybe watch news source. They’ve talking months. prefer unplugged hair dryer, whatever Even Hawaii hasn’t able get control. Shit extremely rural areas state daily cases Ontario. ""They deserve everything coming"" fact, believe not.

I know they've changed view, right. they're recanting damaging content they've posted, that's something.  Hal centric episodes always favorites best. Duh. dont need doctor figure out.

The black fucking plague still exists, spanish flu diseases.

When herd immunity achieved either vaccine natural infection, virus become another endemic virus.

I know guy acting like social distancing going become norm jaz wont. simply impossible, cant punish people acting human. reminds fate HIV denialist movement. sputtered as, one one, members died AIDS. matter, say wear mask lol  oh lord see return learn plan?

temporary (only 14 days) continuous/remote learning school district may REQUESTED there’s 20% positivity county average 14 days healthcare resource concerns.

seriously fuck kim reynolds. sure helpful want people exposure known case wait 5 days exposure reduce risk false negative. testing sites &amp; Covid hot line informally telling people know calling gives enough time incubate provide accurate result. last straw? perhaps without covid, last straw could another 10 years well, then, anti-vaxxer. send school die, give vaccine rushed, 50% (if that) chance working, may kill anyway.

Please tell sarcasm. not, *really* need pull head sand world may never know... screw guy. Wattendorf also continued DARPA investments vaccines delivered using DNA.

Inovio Pharmaceuticals, funded DARPA, entered Phase 1 trials DNA-delivered covid-19 vaccine April, making second company enter trials United States. Pennsylvania-based firm, began trials 80 days receiving virus’s genetic code, looking begin Phase 2 3 trials summer, pending regulatory approval.

DARPA also funded technologies rapid vaccine development, including companies manufacture vaccines growing proteins tobacco-like plants, well “self-assembling vaccine” platform Massachusetts General Hospital. Mass General’s vaccine center used platform develop traditional covid-19 vaccine entered animal testing early July.

“DARPA comes visionary organization ringing people’s doorbells saying prepare this,” said Mark C. Poznansky, director Mass General Vaccine Immunotherapy Center. “Some people would say enough worry without that.”

'The aspirational dream'

From start, Wattendorf DARPA team knew fast vaccines wouldn’t solve threat infectious diseases posed American troops.

It take weeks vaccine give person protection, even then, follow-up booster shots sometimes needed.

Instead forcing body produce antibodies using vaccine, inject best antibody directly? DARPA team began pursue aim parallel. Wattendorf called rapid delivery antibody using RNA “the aspirational dream.”

The idea take blood virus survivor quickly identify best antibody thousands bloodstream. Then, genetic code antibody could injected troops give temporary protection virus immediately. Protection could range weeks months — enough time deployment.

In pandemic, DARPA envisioned using antibodies “firebreak” — obstacle slows rapid spread conflagration.

For example, one person nursing home tests positive, antibody could given residents prevent spread illness.

Critically, unlike vaccines, antibodies also treat already fallen ill.

DARPA funded development rapid antibody technologies years. Then, around 2016, DARPA Director Arati Prabhakar wanted weave together production line test it.

“Very interesting problems miracle, single-threaded solution,” Prabhakar said.

The result Pandemic Prevention Platform, Prabhakar signed leaving DARPA January 2017. goal four-year $96 million program develop antibody virus within 60 days receiving blood sample survivor.

When covid-19 arrived United States, program’s participants — AbCellera, Vanderbilt University, Duke University AstraZeneca — already done test runs various viruses see could cut time quest hit 60-day goal.

As pivoted tackle covid-19, Jenkins, DARPA program manager, knew participants wouldn’t meet 60-day timeline thought could come close 90 days, potentially help end global pandemic.

Some participants obtained blood sample February one first American covid-19 patients return China. sample wasn’t great; patient recovered fairly recently therefore didn’t sufficiently mature immune response draw good antibodies.

At AbCellera, chief executive Carl Hansen forged ahead sample anyway.

On Feb. 28, AbCellera’s employees began working round-the-clock weekend Vancouver offices, ultimately finding 550 unique antibodies using tiny device.

Hansen contacted pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly came agreement, announced March 13, whereby Lilly would manufacture best antibody take clinical trials.

But first decide antibody winner.

Daniel Skovronsky, Lilly’s chief scientific officer, said pharmaceutical company threw normal years-long process window immediately began scaling make top 100 antibodies save time, even though one would proceed.

The company worked AbCellera, National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, academic researchers conduct experiments antibody candidates. late April, pick which, any, proceed last expensive stage scale-up.

The best candidate, determined, antibody No. 555.

“This tough decision,” Skovronsky said. “There mixed views.”

The first patient dosed May 29, 91 days AbCellera received blood sample. became world’s first study potential covid-19 antibody treatment humans, according Lilly. national registry clinical trials indicates Phase 2 expected completed August.

At Vanderbilt, Crowe wanted better sample initial one obtained February. mid-March, team found two people United States infected 50 days earlier China.

After screening samples, team narrowed list 30 best antibodies interacted companies interested producing them.

IDBiologics Inc., Nashville-based biotechnology start-up Crowe co-founded, begin human trials one antibodies August, said, possible availability United States emergency use early next year goes well.

After licensing six antibodies Vanderbilt screening house, AstraZeneca picked two antibodies take clinical trials summer pair, said Mene Pangalos, executive vice president biopharmaceutical research development.

The global pharmaceutical industry produce billions vaccine doses, lacks capacity manufacture antibodies large scale. least initially, antibodies won’t delivered using RNA, although Duke University plans manufacture RNA version antibody, meeting original DARPA vision program.

Wattendorf, left DARPA works Bill Melinda Gates Foundation, said looking back 10 years, agency trying solve problem speed protect American forces.

“These things funded fast,” Wattendorf said. “They actually funded global scale.”

Other DARPA efforts take aim scale question. agency, example, funded technology produce vaccines using plants instead chicken eggs — approach benefit easy mass scale-up.

How secretive Pentagon agency seeded ground rapid coronavirus cure

16 - 20 minutes

Established years current pandemic, program halfway done first case novel coronavirus arrived United States early year. everyone involved effort Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) knew time come ahead schedule.

The four teams participating program abandoned plans began sprinting, separately, toward development antibody covid-19, disease caused coronavirus.

“We thinking preparing long time, it’s almost bit surreal,” said Amy Jenkins, manager DARPA’s antibody program, known Pandemic Prevention Platform, P3. “We hopeful least able impact outbreak. want make difference.”

In program others, DARPA quietly seeding ground United States produce rapid cure pathogen like covid-19 years.

But DARPA’s story counterexample U.S. government foresight, one began decade ago aim finding super-fast ways protect American troops confront deadly new virus field.

If weren’t DARPA’s investments past decade earlier, largely outside glare Washington’s partisan politics, American race toward vaccine antibody therapy stop coronavirus likely wouldn’t moving quickly today.

“Being DARPA time ... exciting ways get see research work funded done ten fifteen years ago really starting pay off,” acting director Peter Highnam said discussion reporters Thursday.

The first company United States enter clinical trials vaccine virus funded DARPA. second company. P3 program already led world’s first study humans potential covid-19 antibody treatment. successful, antibody treatments would offer three months immunity covid-19. Unlike vaccines, could also help heal people already infected virus.

Some vaccines antibodies linked DARPA could ready later year, would mark one speediest responses global pandemic history medicine. Experts say normally takes four 10 years devise, test produce vaccine new pathogen. Antibodies, body creates combat virus, taken years discover, let alone produce.

DARPA far exclusively responsible fast pace. countries, including China, virus originated, also moving quickly toward cure. firms unaffiliated DARPA.

Still, Pentagon agency played significant role advancing science making quick pace possible setting North Star researchers.

“I think role important,” said James E. Crowe Jr., director vaccine center Vanderbilt University, one four participants P3 program. “The reason catalyzed rapid progression otherwise would happened. reason accomplished willing state . . . grand challenges.”

Crowe said colleagues laughed DARPA put request 2017 system could produce human-ready antibody convalescent blood sample 60 days.

“Somehow, setting aspirational goal, first brainstem reaction of, ‘That’s ridiculous,’ next step is, ‘Well, close could get?’ ” Crowe said. “Then, start buying belief could possible.”

'Ringing people's doorbells'

Established 1958 response Soviet Union’s launch Sputnik, DARPA created President Dwight D. Eisenhower sense urgency.

Washington could sent first satellite space, Moscow got first — wasn’t United States lacked science. American government simply didn’t move fast enough.

DARPA answer problem.

The nimble military science research agency wouldn’t invent things itself. Rather, officials would look across American scientific landscape — universities, military labs defense contractors — channel emerging technologies risky mega-endeavors prevent another Sputnik. agency’s pie-in-the-sky projects would high risk failure, successful, would transform U.S. military possibly society, too.

Over years, DARPA-funded projects created building blocks GPS, first computer mouse protocols underpin modern Internet. agency pioneered stealth technology made American fighter jets invisible enemy radar. advanced bevy new weaponry, including drones.

In years attacks Sept. 11, 2001, series anthrax incidents, combined overseas intelligence potential biological threats, heightened fears bioterrorism drove DARPA invest faster ways respond, including technology accelerate vaccine development, spot emerging viruses speed pharmaceutical manufacturing.

A decade ago, brainy Air Force doctor named Dan Wattendorf helped push rapid pandemic response top DARPA’s priority list.

Regularly citing 1918 flu pandemic, DARPA program manager saw novel pathogen, whether another species enemy’s lab, could cripple American military field.

“If need deploy someone harm’s way it’s new virus, don’t time wait new vaccine,” Wattendorf said. “That could decade.”

Wattendorf ideas solution. 2010, took conference room DARPA headquarters Northern Virginia notes scribbled hand make pitch.

At time, Obama administration emphasizing need step pandemic response capabilities wake H1N1 outbreak, DARPA increasingly focusing biology — emphasis would lead agency’s first biotechnology office 2014.

In conference room, Wattendorf outlined ideas agency higher-ups. Regina E. Dugan, DARPA director time, ribbed writing hand greenlighting proposal.

The result program called ADEPT, invested $291 million 2011 2019 array technologies — including credit card-sized device rapid antibody discovery developed Vancouver-based firm AbCellera — that, taken together, could significantly reduce timelines vaccines antibodies.

“It may turn important program time agency,” said Dugan, ran DARPA 2009 2012.

Chief among Wattendorf’s targets program: delivering vaccines antibodies implanting genetic code.

Traditional vaccines inject what’s known antigen — usually piece live deactivated virus sufficient provoke immune system protective response. Antigens typically manufactured long process involves growing live virus chicken eggs bioreactors.

Wattendorf hoped short-circuit it. wanted inject genetic code would prompt human body to create antigen cells, cutting manufacturing process. immune system would recognize antigen cells launch protective response.

By 2010, scientists tested idea using DNA mixed results. Wattendorf wanted try single-stranded sibling RNA.

If successful, RNA could used develop vaccines antibodies, shortening development timelines years days clinical trials, thought. also offered one-size-fits-all approach; future, scientists would need genetic code virus create vaccine.

At time, many considered fool’s errand. ephemeral, RNA unstable environment highly susceptible degradation. unclear get human cell. National Institutes Health, Wattendorf previously worked, research DNA vaccines presenting enough hurdles. wanted take risk trying RNA, too.

“Skeptics cited lack evidence would work, Dan cited lack evidence wouldn’t,” Dugan recalled. “That’s typical DARPA program.”

By 2019, project DARPA funded Massachusetts-based company Moderna demonstrated Phase 1 clinical trial RNA could indeed deliver antibody humans provide protection mosquito-borne virus chikungunya. affirmation Wattendorf’s bet came years DARPA funding effort.

Today, RNA vaccines, although still experimental, among fastest-moving candidates race stop covid-19. March, Moderna first company United States enter Phase 1 trials covid-1 vaccine using RNA. company injected first test human 66 days receiving virus’s genetic code. Phase 2 trials began May, Phase 3 began July 27, making possible vaccine could available end year.

In addition Moderna, two pharmaceutical companies — Pfizer CureVac — pursuing RNA vaccines, small laboratory Imperial College London People’s Liberation Army Academy Military Sciences China. CureVac also funded DARPA.

“Is RNA vaccine going potentially made available scale?” Wattendorf said. “We seeing well could happen. demonstrates role DARPA play creating capabilities.” F chat Sergio perez Trust tell knew there.

Yeah it’s sub pessimistic place ever. good news immediately get shit people like you. 

So yes... course there’s comments. people commenting upvoting ones live hope optimism rather pessimism urge right literally everything KIDDING -- predict would happen?!

Why stop now, who's fooling whom?! are.

If election decide vote, likely third party. Again. now. 

I assume people federal testing probably contracted state. problem isn’t antibodies required fight virus, stated article, others caution remains seen whether level antibodies shield reinfection. “The fact pick antibodies patients infected coronavirus mean protected,” says. “It means recognize virus make right immune response could potentially protective future.” Researchers still know amounts types antibodies prevent reinfection six seven months later, “but soon find out,” adds.

The short half-life antibodies Covid disturbing two reasons:

1) seem disappear substantially much, much faster rate compared corona viruses seasonal illnesses it’s small drop titers— regardless B cell activity need antibodies fight current infection. Influenza antibodies remain baseline ~12 months Covid antibodies seem become nearly undetectable 3 months milder cases (which understand common “super spreaders”). It’s hard imagine scenario one become reinfected mild symptoms helps spread disease others... immunity perfect protection, means body fight virus. 

2) use antibodies detect infection. detection becomes impossible mere 3 months creates major challenge testing understanding wide-spread infection is, leading inefficient response damage. can’t get pandemic control without prolific accurate testing. 

So short lifetime antibodies doesn’t conclusively say anything one’s ability fight virus clinical setting, it’s definitely quality makes things easier. masks also reduce viral load, therefore severity symptoms someone get infected? agree somewhat clickbait title, point still much stands. workers would control means production too!

## Abstract

**Objective** examine protective effects appropriate personal protective equipment frontline healthcare professionals provided care patients coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19).

**Design** Cross sectional study.

**Setting** Four hospitals Wuhan, China.

**Participants** 420 healthcare professionals (116 doctors 304 nurses) deployed Wuhan two affiliated hospitals Sun Yat-sen University Nanfang Hospital Southern Medical University 6-8 weeks 24 January 7 April 2020. study participants provided appropriate personal protective equipment deliver healthcare patients admitted hospital covid-19 involved aerosol generating procedures. 77 healthcare professionals exposure history covid-19 80 patients recovered covid-19 recruited verify accuracy antibody testing.

**Main outcome measures** Covid-19 related symptoms (fever, cough, dyspnoea) evidence severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, defined positive test virus specific nucleic acids nasopharyngeal swabs, positive test IgM IgG antibodies serum samples.

**Results** average age study participants 35.8 years 68.1% (286/420) women. study participants worked 4-6 hour shifts average 5.4 days week; worked average 16.2 hours week intensive care units. 420 study participants direct contact patients covid-19 performed least one aerosol generating procedure. deployment period Wuhan, none study participants reported covid-19 related symptoms. participants returned home, tested negative SARS-CoV-2 specific nucleic acids IgM IgG antibodies (95% confidence interval 0.0 0.7%).

**Conclusion** safe effective vaccine becomes available, healthcare professionals remain susceptible covid-19. Despite high risk exposure, study participants appropriately protected contract infection develop protective immunity SARS-CoV-2. Healthcare systems must give priority procurement distribution personal protective equipment, provide adequate training healthcare professionals use. worst part Ohio is, world news extremely proactive (unlike states) stay home order things got bad. result started trend Republicans business leaders got antsy full reopen right two huge holidays... +1,700 cases yesterday...

It reminds misuse antibiotics, started feeling better taking bitter hard swallow pills bit, stopped taking them. we're deal significantly worse infection result... right you. partially true

Although true Spain Italy shut deeper states, true shut earlier. 3rd March, Spain registered first death. New York would 14th March.

If look mobility data see NY Spain locked within couple days other, despite NY 11 days behind Spain case-wise. minimum wage tied inflation. tied worker productivity.
 
Why? maybe specifically, closely? 1 1? that's typically see productivity arguments.
 
A lot productivity gains undoubtedly tied capital investment. use rudimentary example, say owned sales organization. pay someone sort files assign sales reps. 1999, small business many (or any) computers, files written, sorted passed hand. get 50 files day. spend $40k computers whole office $100k CRM. get 500 files day. get paid 10x much? I'd argue increase pay related ability get computerized files compared current peer, pace 5 years ago. Certainly I'd wonder why, business owner, I'm spending $140k businesses pay everyone 10x much.  
 time society dispel illusion McJobs create.
 
I largely agree this, btw. issue talk $20/minimum wages ""leechy"" businesses go under, entire sectors like restaurants unless pass cost onto consumers almost completely. I'm fine with, I'd argue proliferation Wal-marts, amazons bottom cost businesses show people aren't. Sadly think reap sew here. 
 
With restaurants, btw, they're typically working 6-7% margins. great example encompasses huge chunk minimum wage workers. like owners sitting extra $10-$15/hour give employees.
 
Appreciate it, btw. think minimum wage discussion lot nuanced either extreme gives credit for. ...is group one without treatment? am..very dumb need help. absolutely 100% false. reason 100k never manifested due lack staff resources. super shitty

But hell starts school July? sounds awful. Well said. LARGER sample size studies CDC using tell us it’s ok send kids back school. Pretty sure they're gonna break records everyday dumbasses. Land Fee, Home Slave. current HCQ studies showing somewhere effect, maybe mild negative effect, COVID patients. makes *entirely* likely multiple people received HCQ recovered. 

Your anecdote means nothing. Florence wasn’t 4 hit North Carolina. That’s damage saw person. actually much smaller Michael damage area still waterlogged Florence. Windspeed isn’t everything comes damage — unless you’ve never lived hurricane flooding, you’re disingenuous?

 Harvey damage downgraded, well. slow moving category one much damage faster violent storm, fucking flooding. Probably next week, work wfm got paycheck. lol. hate people tell Amazon pushing new time high every month. Roughly $800/share higher pre corona levels appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* So...how clear concise concrete goal dissolve ""let's lockdown vaccine distributed*"" ignoring original goal spread infections time?

It devolved devolving ""lockdown"" states locked similar (some states lock all) people 1 person leave house essentials 1 day every 2 weeks (as opposed people shopping walmart hobby, take sit large groups people).

It also devolved ""re-opening"" states started reopening long could control new infections; recommended testing positive rate &lt; 3%; many states ""re-opened"" 10%. guidelines two weeks data showing decreasing cases, states realized test results taking 1+ weeks, continued anyway. groups started gathering again.

One thing amazes restaurants dine in, keep cyclical closing ""deep cleaning"" employee tests positive, adjust strategy back mostly take out. No, looking total deaths per capita, New York world's second-highest per capita death toll. New York's death toll 3x higher Italy's death toll. represents tremendous failure leaders citizens New huge surge cases led death toll caused demographics travel, international funnel airports extreme population density NYC

What? Tokyo couple hundred deaths. dense city! lot international airports, including airports full Chinese nationals last fall winter. That's realise countries mri costs 500€ reimbursement pack 30 medecine 5€ reimbursement.

My bet countries sickness would cost thousands reimbursement, point would likely 500€, truly sick, even need work countries. Every study see HCQ calls administered within first 5 days symptoms. study, administered 14 days symptoms. awesome. impression Lowe's filing bankruptcy pre covid? FINALLY -- many predicted would happen. need criminal **lawer**. need **criminal** lawer unlucky enough around adults rise new ""common cold"".

It's job advertised ""50k year"" really get like 35k (didn't math)? called taxes dude. Bonuses taxed like income. Gotcha, mistake then. thought knew ahead time went bank account, got 27th, $324. bills, groceries, etc noticed got it. cured NY, know? keeping reading reached herd immunity.

But come back Meanwhile Target they’ve given us one-time 200 dollar bonus $2 wage increase. wage increase already going give us pandemic. Instead increase taking effect July like planned, moved forward think March. 

I’m thankful job mean right now? know there’s people making unemployment working.

My store first employee coronavirus case report Sunday, too.

They're paid salary research area expertise, one many projects would given time. That's even getting teaching duties, supervising graduate students, post-docs, etc.

It's also bad thing find evidence support claims ""know"". many examples throughout history things ""knew"" fact wrong. basic stuff.

To add that, running surveys inexpensive research. That’s almost impossible do, you’re going stage one long time. top people going get fatigued like already stage 4, stop following rules anyway.

Agreed, good news cruise lines general. Norway relatively low infection burden can't make work, seems like probably workable. No, probably going start deadly pandemic budget infrastructure for....well, Indians mind police beats up. Guess i’m choosing Lowes HD Yes, like better. Quality going downhill too.

From Wikipedia page Spanish Flu clear significant impact children. reduced educational attainment, lower income, lower socioeconomic status, compared birth cohorts. 

That's good. sending school means might get sick bring home. Democrats overwhelmingly voted adopting Medicare 2020 platform day. Lowes work exactly this.

The audacity. virus discriminates people aged 60 above. No, country pure garbage. Sweden still doesn’t recommend face masks still much higher burden infection relative Nordic neighbors. Denmark, cases risen slightly since mid-July, SST come recommendations facemasks (not enough imo, getting better almost every day now). Denmark still much lower burden infection Sweden, yet anti-masker chief Tegnell continues deny useful wonder studies showing are. absolutely ridiculous given science masking quite well settled. 

This article also address ongoing isolation Swedish elderly still isolation. compared Denmark (and probably Nordics, def. Iceland) it’s possible return less normal lives since start July. One thing discussed much Sweden impact long term isolation elderly. Sweden's elderly really quite roundly abused pandemic. followed model closer Nordic neighbors, fewer would died would probably still isolation. Tingle slayer? Nice troll throwaway.

The proportion infected abroad increasing – [in Norway]
During last two weeks, half new cases known site infection reported infection traveling abroad, FHI writes recent weekly report .
**The vast majority, however, ""red"" countries, means quarantined returned home. nine people (or 16 percent) traveling ""green"" country**: [pie chart, see article]

Nevertheless, FHI emphasizes spread infection Norway still low. According VG's figures, Norway still flat infection trend .

#This increased

Already last week, FHI able report large increase number people infected abroad, opened trips abroad 10 July . fact, saw tripling week 28 29 . many 21 22 infected abroad week 28 infected ""red"" countries.

Since then, two outbreaks Moss come travelers ""green"" countries. Two men Trondheim one person Drammen infected trip ""green"" Denmark.

•	This increased: proportion infected coronavirus abroad (as opposed Norway) according FHI 11 per cent week 28. Updated figures show rose 44 per cent week 29 - 51 per cent week 30.
- **Do see concern people state infected green land?** 
- important aware also travel green countries mean exposed greater risk infection Norway, answers FHI chief physician Siri Helene Hauge.
**This current travel advice [map]:**

•	Note: Belgium probably colored ""red"" week - also Czech Republic FHI's infection requirements.
•	
- infection situation many green countries significantly higher Norway. concern is, course, Norway local outbreaks result imports infection abroad, situation following closely, says Hauge FHI.

**But still: NIPH emphasizes numbers still small people infected abroad infected ""red"" countries.**
 
- still small figures number infected abroad, still seems majority infection comes red countries, writes FHI chief physician Siri Helene Hauge e-mail VG. raised Christian church, several different denominations growing up.

Point is, you’re sadly spot fundamentalist perspective anything “contradicts” Bible must work devil. they’re missing pretty simple, harsh, obvious facts right front them, today: people sick dying wear mask you’re really showing love neighbor (ie. everyone around you).

Now think places got hit hardest right start: Europe, New York, Quebec, Ontario. mutated Europe, spread Italy/Spain France/UK New York/Ontario/Quebec, would explain lot things.

As contagious strain spreads, places easier time earlier slipping. mean damn do, damn dont. Give Lowe's credit. Also, people cant leave collect unemployment, dont think works like that. may true, parking lot Lowes still looks like Black Friday, even random Tuesday.

What true there's little population level evidence children spreading it. closed schools, kept kids home, enough tests asymptomatic people, children likely be.

And again, we've done before. close schools pandemic significant sources spread. Thank link! actually missed guy DP debacle, looks interesting. 

I also feel sorry cruise business because, yeah, going safe cruise it'd Hurtigruten. Well, guess whatever local one New Zealand safe one.

Many people feel strongly one way trials. cannot comment , comment personally seen.

Airbnb said Friday suspended removed 35 rentals across New Jersey, comes days state's governor linked indoor house parties recent rise coronavirus cases.

The giant online rental company said made move following complaints house parties violate coronavirus restrictions gatherings.

""They coronavirus gets passed around efficiently,""he said. ""They safe. Period.""

Murphy said ""series"" recent house parties, including one Middletown, linked 50 new cases. Nearly three dozen Surf City lifeguards also tested positive virus attending gatherings Long Beach Island, governor said.

Other countries proper shutdowns, opened stages reactive current climate results place US So...how clear concise concrete goal dissolve ""let's lockdown vaccine distributed*"" ignoring original goal spread infections time?

The people calling harsher lockdowns saying lock there's vaccine.

The ideal situation would lock number cases low enough effective test, track trace system get contacts confirmed cases isolate rest us get back normal.

This countries like Germany trying do. life gone back normal deaths kept 10 per day July.

Is easy? No. might way saving millions lives also getting economies fully running side vaccine. can. vaccine make smaller issue tho. We'll likely see large chunk population US refuse it, tho.

We've stores running pillows certain window blinds, almost double mattress sales year-to-year.

The enforced lockdown hurt, sales caught surpassed expectations. This.

Sweden didn’t introduce country wide lockdown like European countries, absolutely enforce social distancing forced businesses close couldn’t abide guidelines.

Despite going all-in lockdown, economy still suffered... added bonus much higher excess death rate compared neighbouring countries.

And noted earlier alternative Test, Trace, Quarantine eliminate spread altogether. Several nations succeeded, let foreigners in.

So already shown elimination seen one single epidemiologist saying believe eradicate virus planet.

At point, nations focused nations like USA leadership nothing remotely resembling national let alone global strategy.

I sat butt front tv set. Mississippi doesn’t super high population actually lot didn’t assume things, ventured epidemiology stuck home. That’s things work. one country many deaths one fewer deaths, drastically reduce mortality via therapy vaccination, first country deaths end pandemic. totally agree last paragraph. No. one this. Last team standing wins can’t convince stupid though

Reference: u/JerseyMike3 daycare summer school evidence easily outweighs 1 study claims fine.

First all, study claim fine, tries find transmission rate younger children. say transmit it, lot less. another study done Netherlands corroborates study numbers lower. note children less likely spread regular classroom setting, likely get teachers get home, spread families.

This kind information vital determine if/when open schools how. Dutch used results set distancing guidelines teacher/students relax students large gaps may impractical cases. IIRC, focused additional testing teachers instead students.

I also want repeat personally think safe open schools parts US yet, got keep open mind. main concern timeliness testing. cannot stop spread virus without testing. magic wand solve one problem, I'd get fast accurate testing getting 100% mask usage US (although fact still constantly hearing ""scientists"" hydrocloriquin (or however spell it) every week months sides saying 100% opposite things. clear studies and/or reporting (at best) less clear around Personally trust application scientific method improve safety quality life middle crises never lower.

That means either contact tracing thorough enough, widespread community transmission already taking place. Oh, claiming meant NEW cases.

Got it! 👍

Clearly, new cases spiking rural areas.

 end, every country probably death rate similar Sweden

Really doubt that. Hospitals governments much better prepared, death rate fallen every country that's controlled first wave new ways fight virus. 

If there's vaccine next year none neighbours come close touching per capita numbers. virus control Texas June? hospitals overrun mandates control spreading late June.

Would consider what's happening Texas 'shutdown' 'lockdown' ? Mandated mask wearing, bars, reduced restaurant capacity, halting elective medical procedures implemented late June slow rate infection. Hospitalization peaked late July growth 40% new rules place. 

If government implemented measures, hospitals would've surely overwhelmed. Houston area hospitals open new ICU units, hired travel nurses, received help military medical personnel cope surge.

Exposure Recent recovery severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection, determined reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction swab test upper respiratory tract.

Main Outcomes Measures Demographic characteristics, cardiac blood markers, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging obtained. Comparisons made age-matched sex-matched control groups healthy volunteers (n = 50) risk factor–matched patients (n = 57).


Results 100 included patients, 53 (53%) male, median (interquartile range [IQR]) age 49 (45-53) years. median (IQR) time interval COVID-19 diagnosis CMR 71 (64-92) days. 100 patients recently recovered COVID-19, 67 (67%) recovered home, 33 (33%) required hospitalization. try avoid that.

What nutty conspiracy theory now? Labour able win back 1997, 2001 2005. goal pretty much open come back power got serious leader. Corbyn unelectable every way. Kier might be. think he's best ever, seems somewhat reasonable least. Makes look pretty silly realize much time effort bill melinda gates put disease/virus research around world.

No, told that. told right pro business faction Denmark one pushing ruling left government reopening ruling left government may giving bit bone short term, changing tracks like Icelandic governemnt did. there's one thing ruling Danish government done wll crisis appeasing strong anti-lockdown sentiments coming Danish right, mentioned vocal support Sweden's controlled burn herd immunity strategy. 

There scares right wing pro-Swedish strategy faction Denmark might get way before, thankfully ruling left government (who highly critical Sweden's controlled burn herd immunity strategy, even made really cutting jokes bad let technocrats rule country Sweden pressers) really good outmaneuvering right (and again, misleading present done deal since decision final). ETA: Danish friend informed discuss reopening parliment then, thinks almost certainly approve it.

And again, article states DK expanding masking policies. Unlike Sweden whose policies remain stridently anti-mask one quotes Tegnell's anti-masking statements without proper attribution, one said comments removed misinformation here! really remarkable sad someone strong anti-science views charge developed country's corona response. 

Yes, % increase looks bad, going 15ish per day 40-60sih per day look bad. Again, Sweden still objectively far worse infection burden therefore deserves concern. Also, cases Sweden increasing regions expected increase fall, many Swedish experts calling NPIs. Sadly, experts often abused ignored Sweden unlike Denmark, many many experts saying going forward reopening mistake, hey Danish government probably listen them, past. Thanks proving point ignorance, 99% sure said earlier :)

Just interest, British? /u/tenyearstendays overwhelmingly concerned Swedish friends must extremely relieved situation Sweden getting better. mitigation efforts state level, I'm skeptical testing delays, cities counties put mask orders effect.

So yes, think it’s going keep coming back there’s herd immunity infections vaccine. article even called out. Gov.

**The bus drivers Midttrafik revolt fact next Thursday possible buy ticket cash.**

Payment cash Midttrafik's buses banned since March, corona broke physical money major spreader infection.

But next Thursday, possible passengers buy tickets cash. decision, however, gotten bus drivers seats. believe health endangered.

One revolt Ebbe Hemmingsen Thorning.

\- Midttrafik simply think about. drivers insecure this, says bus driver. 

\- Danish money infected. dirtiest money, many hands, elaborates. 

## Disagreement need cash payment

Since corona came Denmark, otherwise possible buy tickets via app travel card.

\- pressure us want spend cash. everyone loves digital solutions. older people weak difficulty finding solutions there, still need able pay cash, says Hans Okholm, deputy chairman Midttrafik. 

But Ebbe Hemmingsen understand necessary allow cash

\- passengers want pay money, easily avoid informing something get travel cards buses, says bus driver. 

But deputy chairman Midttrafik, owned Central Jutland Region region's municipalities, insists necessary.

\- arrange rubber gloves plastic gloves, supermarket, example, think possible find solutions. pay anything cash, like in, done proper way, says Hans Okholm.

*Can't put protective gear disinfect hands?*

\- Yes, that. get delayed. mask must discarded every time take off, otherwise infection, disinfect fingers, says Ebbe Hemmingsen. 

Midttrafik investigated possibility getting plexiglass window driver customers - avoid close buying ticket. However, according company, proved difficult get approved auditoriums. Hey that's similar company eliminated 401k contribution match... Good thing we're essential... read conclusion: entire “study” unhelpful speculation correct Sweden much longer tail continued transmission. first wave EU mostly ended two months ago, Sweden coming first wave. I'm teacher upsets many school boards talk hand sanitizer spraying surfaces ignoring issue entirely. ventilation lot old school buildings already atrocious. would expensive fixes many cases though, clearly budget even basic maintenance done properly. amount trade US impossible quarantine everything country. NZ less population many US cities. also cases show immediately lifting restrictions. Naw. Mostly generic RIP/thoughts prayers post.

They starting single random people social media blaming infections factories stuff. Usually whoever displays symptoms first.

My wife blamed whole line getting shut despite 6 11 people line traveling Florida wedding... developed countries single payer system, outrageous lie repeated many times know guess people accepted fact. used argument “everyone it” argue doesn’t need account he’ll pay “they did.” 
 
Every developed country universal healthcare. single payer system none single payer systems banned private insurance like M4A proposal. Canada ban private insurance. Polls show people generally happiest fully nationalized systems like Denmark (similar Dept Veterans Affairs Hospitals). Countries like Germany multi payer system private insurance strong regulations combined substantial government subsidies. much closer original vision ACA (“Obamacare” public option). 
 
There country planet Earth proposed M4A plan, country figured implement single payer system bans private insurance $0 copays deductibles exist, argument “they it” massive lie. 
 
Healthcare complicated expensive yes every developed country better system. essentially like Cambodia. means teeeeth, leeeeggggs Um, they've like they've always really. thing ""too many vaccine candidates"" case. read back March. It’s insane written Coronavirus, perfectly outlines many failures leadership we’re seeing today. 2 friends work teachers school, GF retired HS, several friends work teachers HS.  heard rumor another student HS quarantined show classes.

* 3' separation requirement, even that's possible due classroom limitations.  Further, teachers directed *not* remove desks, hampering individual efforts meet separation requirement.
* staggered departures classes. (They students may crowd door leave)
* *single* water fill-up station *entire* school.  meant replace *all* water fountains.
* lunch schedule before, Seniors separate room.   Yesterday students STAND lunch.
* marks lunchroom floor maintain proper student distancing
* supply wipes hand sanitizer distributed teachers.   One teachers sent pic rag squirt bottle desk today cleaner known help COVID-19.
* plan one-way hall stair traffic classes.
* Side note: lost 3 maintenance workers likely make difficult keep disinfection cleaning. company's defence, air travel virtually impossible times call centers working home-! Everyone ought remember people going China: could happen almost country, including rich western nations. time point-scoring, solidarity save lives. Swedes legal right 4 weeks vacation summer. pick July since tends best weather.

Some places skeleton crew, many close month.

A lot people switched using metro biking, electric bikes, electric skateboards, working home. keeps public transports less crowded, social distancing worked.

I've gotten masks keep get caught crowd. far works fine patience. Wait people move, walk around, etc. Obama golden boy wrong. Remember promised fix NSA spying absolutely nothing? One line thought kids typically asymptomatic mildly symptomatic, therefore coughing/sneezing viral loads like adults symptoms.

But, morons forgot kids pick boogers, eat them, lick everything, serve efficient vectors almost every virus... Don’t worry happy!!! Checking doomers become hobby. Maybe even drop something optimistic see many downvotes get. well fact much call center/customer support working home right now. really appreciate definitely making claim student teacher quarantine based classmate’s positive test. “We weren’t closer 3 feet! moved seats every 15 minutes!” It’s absolutely unfathomable anyone thinks they’ll get away longer week two. Wow, children really going dying months school aren’t they? stop interstate travel. soon restrictions lifted new Mexico, job sent South Carolina (I'm sorry new Mexico, everything could isolate sanitize there.)

In month want go Florida.... Right, government's response events related mind. deny science reality billionaires inconvenienced main response seems. course America nationwide propaganda networks radio, TV internet/FB etc deny science reality 24/7/365. job well unfortunately. watch enough people breaking home quarantine washing away social distance effort...because gov think everyone home quarantine.... mention role playing Buzz Aldrin [*From Earth Companies start paying funerals emotional compensation losing loved one got shot face wearing mask. father Sam much different opinions pours mean pint. title misleading there's actual state emergency yet. relevant sentence is「状況がさらに悪化したら、都独自の緊急事態宣言を発することも考えざるをえなくなる」, translating ""If conditions continue worsen, choice consider declaring Tokyo-specific state emergency"". 

It seems like another state emergency inevitable, quite yet. full tour Tokyo disneyland pandemic:  telling US using horrible annualized rate methodology number actually meaningless actual GDP growth (which -9.5%) inflation What??? 

/s Also, correct I'm wrong, take still test people absolutely necessary.

Maybe novel virus many unknowns even now, 7 months it. 

In Canada Conservatives Liberals praising others actions publicly COVID responses. 

You know why? realize virus absolutely nothing, zero, politics. Prime Minister Liberal, Premier (Governor) Conservative. come party belong far COVID concerned. done pretty good job overall. Sickle Cell Anemia well known well documented, absolutely right. can't think vaccine/medication we've make different versions per different races efficacy safety reasons.

When read original comment, 100% agreement part: ""because makes sense dragging one group across finish line. get end race."" thought ""We might find vaccine works great white people, work people"" pretty unfounded? since ""there notable genetic differences races"" reasoning might end vaccine worked great white people, thought knew precedences would support saying, that's all. 20k test done today, day week.

It reminds treated parents younger trying 'clever' getting parents say something would specifically prove right. juvenile disrespectful.

Protests help spread, that's obvious conclusion, least majority wearing masks. Meanwhile hear constant stories friends religious relatives go far say there's extreme division animosity church circles regarding masks simply basics required. people realize unreasonable, puts strain social connections other.

It's messy situation. through. protesters, actions vital importance. faith crowd, true minds. think biggest difference (aside venue) comes willingness do, rather minimum legal requirement, measured reasonable set tasks mitigate situation. Even there's perfect proof. all, healthy part faith? meant others within capability?

(I worn mask willingly whole time, care myself, care around me. difficult concept religious crowd? :/)

TL;DR: Politician made goal get specific soundbite help agenda, shows unwilling acknowledge foolishness 'his side'. human, instead politician, would said ""Alright, understand. church protests cause moderate spread virus. Thank answer. Please wear masks keep reasonable distance other. Godspeed."" War. pretty decent.

I can't stand Republicans, laying problems entirely feet misguided best.  Covid really affecting local mom pops, big corporations raking big time

It's easy happen lockdown legislation considers niche businesses 1 customer every 10 minutes public health hazard locks down, allows megacorps still operate highly-dense b&amp;m ""essential"" sell non-essentials smaller guys business shut bankrupted for. use whole population number whole population virus? use people virus percentage goes up, that's true percentage. like saying cancer kill people cancer. course doesn't, cancer. know tell ignorant person? 
Because ignore Texas worst voter suppression state yet make comments like one above. Oh yes agree. government failed close half million people U.S ended homeless. cost living keeps sky rocketing ever need leadership. pandemic gonna end people homeless, businesses struggling well hard people get job. right homeless shelter town capacity turning people away. Also mention become crowded. 

This time government take charge, sadly dont see case handling far. gonna involve us Individuals help out. far I'm grateful governor become strict response, however neighbors Texas Arizona produced high amount tourism NM. People dont get traveling. mean white house manipulating medical data sent like everyone thought would? *surprised pikachu face* 


About 4%. changed much since article would say. Ok thanks, can't hurt wear properly least. Better safe sorry. question is: desantis take credit drop cases...or “miracle” hurricane? Unfortunately several things address makes think clearly defend them. ""It would preempt tough state workplace safety laws""

This combined admission bill's minimum safety standards joke telling (from article, consider safety requirements adopt considered burdensome, 'consideration' alone would shield fault). lower bar basically nothing, also prevents states enforcing actual ""The proposal would supersede federal worker safeguards Occupational Safety Health Act 1970, Fair Labor Standards Act 1938, Americans Disabilities Act 1990 Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act 2008, among others.""

Pretty self-explanatory here, also conveniently ""The bill would move liability cases federal court, instantly would increase costs plaintiffs.""

What's point this? Oh that's right, make absolutely impossible state standards whatsoever enforced ridiculously expensive line worker file anything. comment punitive awards means many cases won’t enough money even break even, much less earn living. Ergo, tort lawyers loath take COVID cases. GOP, mission accomplished.""

Further making worthless file complaint. I'm sure line worker represent federal court though specifically, measure mentions “demand letters.” communications prospective defendant setting forth facts claim, evidence assembled plaintiff, reckoning potential damages statement much plaintiff would accept make case go away. documents often designed opening brief negotiation; since neither side injury case really wants go trial, make sense. GOP bill would make anyone offering settle, either demand letter otherwise, liable sued damages case they’re making “meritless.” That’s another term that’s undefined measure. Unlike limitation damages elsewhere bill, way, punitive damages awarded employers bringing lawsuits aren’t capped.""

So incredibly difficult expensive file complaint, also incredibly risky case 100000% airtight face federal judge somehow crosses absurdly high bar (that bill sets) prove fault. Also addressed measure also gives attorney general right bring lawsuit cases. result, Kennerly observes, Atty. Gen. William Barr would get right “to sue unions, labor activists, lawyers, doctors — everyone involved coronavirus claims.”""

Also self-explanatory also conveniently addressed.

Does bill explicitly say ""Now employers allowed sue employees""? No. enable employers threaten employees financial ruin dare even think filing complaint, one wont get anything anyways? Absolutely inarguably. like plea deal system, people heavily encouraged take 'light' punishment may life-altering (a huge fine short time prison) rather dare inconvenience courts asking rights thus risk life-ending outcome (decades prison) crime. complicated design arguable. Update: Vietnam reported 2nd death 1 hour ago. He/she chronic disease many years contracting COVID-19. Personally expect deaths coming next days. course.

But policies require political any. mean, vote passing every school levy school funding request control pay limited say it. yes, let's take small amount appreciation feel diminish guess? Public health emergencies things bypass loopholes, Florida!

&lt;disgruntled live life basing opinions peoples intelligence demographic culture, actual academics, think wrong side fence 2020. recommendation nasopharyngeal swab wait 3 days symptom onset lowest risk false negatives (20%), see . get tested symptom onset know negative result unreliable then. nasal swab even less reliable NP swab know much. 

 ""Over 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" 

 **Nasal-Swab Testing Misses Patients Low SARS-CoV-2 Viral Loads** :  find bit odd Wednesday Thursday tbs exact death count Us tho. exactly opposite right thing do. People sick don’t look sick ones transmit most.  hate Bill Gates punch down, there's lot idiots there, even idiots money. Esp it’s Florida Arizona medical folks ground reporting dire conditions data analysts saying, hey: getting better! 😃 Homeschool kids. Forever. also check stuff like MIT's Harvards BPP. 928 dead Wisconsinites applaud ""rugged individualism"" Whole Foods money pit. making bank lol it’s hospital data right? HHS never stated controlling testing data impossible anyone without car go grocery shopping every two weeks. almost fucking useless. time get results back, hospital (or worse). Again, could committed online learning vast majority students. person needs ventilator already much better data potential survival hanging end bed chart. Vaccines know person would light case fatality use less personalized data sets make decisions. Treatment know absolute fact risk factors specific patient huge, detailed medical file actual real immune response covid. 

As usual, things people think conspiracy malice person making leap lacking knowledge asses question.  think many cases flattening new case curve comes hitting testing capacity. see many cases positivity rate continues climb I'm Amazonian, I'm fully aware previous incentives. guess part people never satisfied, regardless incentives company offer. Online pickup door car only. one first things did. Absolutely nobody except workers allowed stores several months.

It NOWHERE near simple. literally elections.

He party leadership election specific group people. people UK describe someone *unelectable* mean sense could never win general election.

If took crazy definition, could say ANYONE electable, even leader Monster Raving Loony pay way attention, tbh

A far left ""paper"". Great source. (You gone Independent's story, *slightly* credible, yet misrepresents Boris et al *all bloody time*). Right wing papers attack left wing politicians. Left wing papers attack right wing politicians.

Op Ed CGTN discredits her, CGTN leans heavy pro-China writer exactly expert.... knows? found anything else yet either supporting denying claims. agree government providing more, they're not, people still need work survive. Republicans. Democratic House authorized back May, gop refused still refuses consider it. multiple injunctions issued already.

the cases shoppers suing state businesses businesses requiring masks, shoppers losing.

the cases general people suing state blanket must-wear-masks-in-public getting injunctions. plainly unconstitutional.

if can't see distinction, that's problem. states intentionally drafted former know latter unconstitutional. American living Switzerland here. reopened borders 0 cases days end. floating around 100 cases day since then, we're 200. 1 50000 people caught yesterday, many. caused worry, we're phasing back things previously finished. Masks compulsory pub transpo shops again. Healthcare better states, even numbers we've around one death day.

Compare girlfriend's hometown Texas 700 new cases yesterday. That's one 3000 people county catching it. also 8 deaths county yesterday. parents live 65.

In Switzerland schools first thing close April, anything else. current policy there's single case Covid, whole school shuts two weeks.

So yeah, we're experiencing increase cases, trying conflate wave US experiencing bit disingenuous. really wish US would states follow procedures, there'd much less death. there's lot ""socialist"" factors missing states hard set pandemic like paid sick leave, really good unemployment welfare, surplus give small businesses die covid too. learn something new every day. Thank you. Wdym? It’s money, athletes. Use you’re head, MLB make money shit season down? Fair enough, I'll give cliffnotes.

Don't penalize people, wear mask should. I'd say opinion along lines politicizing masks. America first world country, wasn’t keep facade one though.

It’s like get rich quick scheme guru country shows rented Lamborghini lives mom’s basement. laborers dont want laborers direct competition lead negative wage pressure. studies show working class negatively impacted increased immigration.

The seems ""i want poor people exploit"" reasons.

And wouldnt really call unique reasons, im sure many people share them. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* saying day. CDC shoulda given detailed instructions make cloth masks. materials use etc... 

Ever see mountains clothes back room Goodwill store? Volunteers coulda gone nuts.

It’s reason you’ll see conservative Christian ™ politicians allegedly pro life support death penalty, want cut funding social stuff helps kids foster care, sick people can’t afford insurance, etc. 

And also you’ll see Christian ™ politicians want strip LGBTQ unions civil protections “sanctity marriage” affairs like 3rd marriage. Christian ™ nationalist constituents turn blind eye keeps dominant political position. 

Religious nationalism kind typically uses imagery twisted version said religion’s philosophy bends petty earthly pursuits like gaining political power wealth.

In short, reckon vaccine approve enough return normal - unimaginable something approved next 2-4 months. sad consequences may come decisions Glad bought Trex Home Depot.  shut up.

Reading explanation, sounds like still serious concerns data removed video couple reasons:

* People misusing video promote anti-science viewpoints
* red vs blue states trend may dominated Texas Florida, makes discrepancy larger (although seem like removing eliminates it)
* seem like HHS could modify state-level reporting without visible comparison sources (something others remarked on, good piece critical thinking).  

With caveats: still something odd concerning happening data here. suggests need greater transparency explanation behind it. **[per that’s exactly people saying shutdowns first proposed. No, mortality rate COVID isn’t super high, level care infected need *extreme*, puts *huge* strain already inefficient medical system. yeah increase quality life unemployed who'll catch end declaring bankrupcy cause bills pay.

They’ll never face people simply target actual potential leadership every time people begin stir. We’ve already seen Portland BLM activists years back. bunch suddenly started dying “accidents” “suicides” recall correctly.

Edit: returning sports coronaball. Nothing “Hate” parties want, Election Day remember show vote Democrat actually want things improve.

Signed: rest world. mostly Swedes always good everything

Except killing people apperently.

But yes Swedes massivly arrogant. rest world learned now. He’s trying caricature Democrat thinks exists level, obviously doesn’t. It’s sad lonely bored person trying stir pot Last time checked rest Scandinavia 172 countries. Thanks.... that's interesting approach. Kind bummer though, best time life summer breaks. Try changing mind no-mask-wearers.

While government says ok... Let’s revisit couple months statistics seem changing. changed 2018. Legislation passed excluded medical debt main credit report. 

But yeah still sued, thats different animal. 

Its far likely ages though. ignored probably $10k medical bills. point everything prior 2018 aged fallen off. Nothing new 2018 . credit bounced back 700s now. Theres probably $2-3k post 2018 charges there, theres zero point paying now. decide litigate ill cross bridge comes up, 2k pocket global pandemic, riots, economic depression, ect important spending abate marginal risk sued.

The courts even capacity hear eviction cases let alone normal criminal cases let alone petty civil litigation lol. dog points I’ve seen articles:

1. Dogs shown around **mid 90s percent accuracy** various teams/countries. 

2. indication pick **asymptomatic/presymptomatic** cases two dogs France right two samples positive everyone thought negative humans retested. 

3. Testing people **free** way. 

4. Dogs test **250 people hour**. 

5. Dogs germany **trained week**.

6. Testing done people may **reluctant tested** ways. Think homeless camps people afraid swabs thinking Covid hoax.

7. Results **instant**.

8. Dogs test odor samples contact people.  guy going death bed still denial reality. hearing hot mess! Watch cspan can. think Scalise argued high school football likely injure students covid 19 (hmmmm... Last heard football injuries fucking CONTAGIOUS) among dumbass statements. Fauci still voice reason, although looks worn out. You’re allowed angry long vote. don’t vote you’re part problem opted say democratic system. 

If young people voted Medicare would probably already reality US. ultimately Sanders’ two primaries failed large margin it’s clear supporters louder internet likely show actually vote. Millennials largest voting bloc US, highest turnout they’d choose politicians. Good, I'm glad sell issue like epidemiologists, mask issue. clear, depends get done. got done Kaiser. Got positive result 40 hours later. girlfriend got tested found out, via CVS, gotten results back yet we're day 6. mom got tested within last couple days whoever medical provider already results back. think academic anyways, season year.

That said hard questions answer. Imagine drafted rookie year, do? could play safe take paycheck know healthy 2021 season. someone little younger college replace you? looked upon sitting out? missed opportunity prove yourself?

If couple seasons in, even worse. know getting older, younger fresher players likely replace soon. much time left grab much cash can. ""Patrick, think fire get bigger!""

""Nonsense!"": pours gasoline Thank someone finally said ""In end, every country probably death rate similar Sweden take longer happen""

This justification people using, silly. fact new treatments \*massively\* reduced fatality rate new COVID cases, likely improve time goes on. Moreover, there's vaccine optimistic schedule (something looks likely), highly likely countries avoid deaths entirely.

This whole strategy like getting choice paying car cash, buying negative-interest-rate loan huge chance forgiven entirely. Sweden chose pay cash. Except Sweden paid cash, lives real humans, never spend time families again. Stop patting back it. really, New Zealand did. number countries. accept admission defeat. all, cakewalk. thought tougher adversary, much emotional correctly formulate logical response.

Better luck next time. fact forced make choice answer joke America best country world. Hyperbole much?

Feb-Jun deaths 24 years old.

It would take **5 years** rate reach 2000 deaths. like reddit unicorn. Someone actually admits they're wrong. respect. exactly switched shopping home depot shopping lowe’s. home depot also gave crazy money trump little increases hourly workers.  Per first amendment US Constitution, right assemble religious purposes right assemble protest upheld equally. part question reasonable. Starting think everyone carry pepper spray point. irrationality Americans boiling point, stupidity needs start hurting. yeah...it 3 months ago. line - clearly sharing profusely Better rest scandinavia aswell eh?

Stop defending Sweden.  Agree completely. point mainstream view simultaneously holds vaccine solve everything, impossible become immune COVID, since vaccines work granting immunity logically incompatible pair views hold. Let ask - find places world people went back offices, restaurants, stores even baseball games, spike, conclude adults spread virus? Yeah, Floridian still care cat 1.

They're company specializes creating schedules extremely large employers like call centers, warehouses, etc. craft schedule changes, breaks, etc HR people managers to. Check replies see I'm talking haha.

At least that's WFM rest us talking 😂 Except fact govt passed businesses hand 80hrs PTO positive test! much disinformation. I’m Hoosier tested positive yesterday work giving PTO whole quarantine. Also it’s day 4 sick I’m 80% Sorry increased hourly workers pay one month. stayed increased.

The dead rise time now. dont seem understand use commas correctly.

I mean, might true 🤣 point still 4% many, 4% americans socially distanced one would claim lot americans socially distancing.

More 400,000 many. Objectively. 

You want contextualize numbers works ways. Assume 400,000 $1 bills. 

If $400,000 comparison someone $1, would say person many dollars you. Bezos would laugh say, ""you think that's lot?!""

But objectively 400,000 still many. live Texas stats risen.

It's actual going things necessary (like going gym instance) increases positive cases. antimasking. seen hundreds people wearing masks practicing social distancing since summer began pretty sure NJ residents. Cool freaking beans s/ cancer

**Question** statewide school closure associated decreased incidence mortality coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)?

**Findings** US population–based time series analysis conducted March 9, 2020, May 7, 2020, school closure associated significant decline incidence COVID-19 (adjusted relative change per week, −62%) mortality (adjusted relative change per week, −58%). model derived analysis, estimated closing schools cumulative incidence COVID-19 lowest quartile compared highest quartile associated 128.7 fewer cases per 100 000 population 26 days 1.5 fewer deaths per 100 000 population 16 days.

All I’m pointing worry comes place ignorance. look virology (actually read articles instead headlines studies r/COVID19), would worried. 

I extremely worried March, read researched kept date feel lot better.

Good luck you, hope find less worry knowledge going forward. reports videos China welding apartment doors shut reported beginning February.


Goggles seems reasonable compared China does. bad, McDonald's. Wisconsin cops tripping putting statements respond violations statewide mask order.

Though maybe... protectors capitalist class they'll choose enforce private company mandates. Release LOT tigers 😝 never heard covid-19 euthanizations, refuse treat elderly people. Cost benefit analysis limited financial price decision.

Cost = give up, sacrifice
Benefit = improvement/change receive

In point, cost wearing mask includes: price mask (low almost everything N95 masks) social sacrifices (not able effectively communicate, read facial cues others) possible physical health consequences (probably low, impossible say exist without previous period entire world asked wear mask almost times) mental health consequences (including anxiety claustrophobia along depression people feel like cannot escape invisible terror)

The benefits split personal benefit benefit society. Personally, less likely infected covid another airborne virus, though extent can't universally say. Society benefits fewer people readily spreading virus droplets, though again, can't really pin number actual effectiveness this.

You right current mindset business, things unchangeable could hope better (or countless examples developed, heck even 2nd world countries better healthcare). 

You're wrong saying moral views irrelevant, they've catalyst much positive change human history, hopefully dealing predatory health system. Italy reported new cases yesterday since June 5th (382). get free babysitting 7-8 hours day homeschool. parents got sued 10 years ago local hospital. negotiated payments ten dollars month. Yeah, ofc totally agree. It’s definitely complicated data rapidly changing since we’re still middle shit.

Vaccines public goods. COVID-19 treatment data public good. Health care public good.

Life sweden going normal virus.

Every time go supermarket nobody wearing masks. distancing, people act like virus.

Going school afterward nightmare.  go vacation grandmother next week. I’m scared. cultural factors play. example - people voluntarily social distanced, wore masks, Sweden mask mandate many Swedes voluntarily openly wear masks. 

You simply wrong masks. Instead admit done move on, keep on. Semantics like calling 4% many. calling ""baby"", "" bruh"". actual argument. 

When cannot keep facts, becomes null void. Meaningless. Brian Kemp says “seems like perfect time open schools.” thought gov paying covid bill? No? We’re shithole country now. I’m literally looking fucking data.

I also live Miami Dade.

The fuck matter people always trying make everything sound like it’s end world. Wait people going rodeos right now? Well isn’t smart He’s clearly lying cunt decade now. That’s Donnie trying scrub covid numbers inept reporting regime. No. see surveillance relevant. like going go injured person kick face (or not). still going bankrupt litigating actually shown potato-cam surveillance footage. Best avoid together, call paramedics, back off, unless legit think need save someone's life. Haha, bad. long week. needed assistant would say phone ""Okay Google"", talk you.

We're MA, they're sure relevant soon. smoke drink care, drugs taxed severely compensate problems cause society. people alcohol companies pay massive settlements people killed DUI drivers, feeling behaviors around using intoxicating substances would change. Disagree. Thanks first past post voting irregularities like gerrymandering always pissing contest two major parties (Duveger's law). spoiler effect pigeonhole Independent votes (along protest votes, non-votes, spoiled ballots) GOP vote. simultaneously vote Independent (or another party) little GOP/Democratic votes work. enough Independent seats/politicians/etc get outvoted time. Even then, assumes party/candidates politics reasonably balanced heavily skewed towards right. lol obese. Plus we're going BMI virtually everyone MLB, NHL, NBA overweight obese too. LeBron James 'Overweight' according BMI. Kawhi Leonard, overweight. James Harden, overweight. Anthony Davis, overweight. Mike Trout, Obese. Mookie Betts, overweight. Victor Hedman, overweight. Aleksander Barkov, overweight. Brad Marchand, overweight.

BMI really stupid use anyone large populations. large populations regular stupid.

*edit*

Here two extremely obsese people according BMI. guy right BMI Texas: Go big go home (or cemetery) I'd say re-tool bubble la NBA/NHL, point may end exposing *more* players. Crackpot theory

Also, two phases public distribution - limited (only risk groups medical workers) general (what people think of). So, general public distribution could 3 6 months (or more) later. Stop fucking saying live don’t. already caught out.

How delusional? household high risk took team doctors lawyers sue threaten employer, hospital, allow work home.

I absolutely lose job die US contain virus vaccine successful.

Really obviously. We’d still see exact populace refusing wear masks. It’s health benefits them. Sending kids back school going like throwing fuel already burning fire.

TP shortages annoying, quickly rectified. think mask shortages would nearly bad anyway because, we've seen, people interested wearing them. ways grandparents parents raised kids would downright illegal now. kid walking school grounds police show up. 

In Illinois example, children must 14 left alone home, entirety elementary school beyond left alone parent goes work. mean working public feels like matter get sick, too? see people around falling like dominos. less wearing mask lack empathy, respect, self control. many American workers union protection unions available them. already decades American history classes still uncomfortable teaching anything 20th century ""we saved world WWII"".

That’s trend current situation. never bring back 5700 people Sweden died COVID-19... looking glass people. places life went back normal cases continued trend downward I'd assume mechanisms transmission insufficiently understood.

The Netherlands course conclusive proof maybe turns anomaly. see, young kids seem much less driver young adults, contrast respiratory illnesses host diseases.

Since we're talking know interested, saw recently down-proof ticking filters relatively well (sorry study details handy hyperlink). recently made masks two layers quilting cotton one layer ticking. mask fitted properly, breathing chore!

I’m sorry I’m ignorant clueless, I’m hearing different things place. Boris Johnson said vaccine years away recently, vaccine companies saying could ready October? Fauci saying end year! 

I’m also curious treatment covid something optimistic terms quickly would available use!

Westerners failed read take seriously coming China. blame China mistakes.

People cant even afford normal health plans, COBRA costs double, more. struggling pay $200-400 month insurance, can't afford $400-800 Especially still deductible pay, OOP maximum, coinsurances, copays, benefit limit, plan arbitrarily deny anything.

If eligible Medicaid, checks eligibility monthly, wife must make $41k year family five, unreasonable since ER nurses make average $51k. Since furloughed, probably qualified unemployment, means made $600 week plus whatever Nevada pays unemployment. scenario true, hard say can't afford unless terrible credit excessive debt, possible way deserved far beyond control.

That said, COBRA drain almost unemployment money, would worse unemployment extension exist. There's basically cases domestically, problem enforcing quarantine incoming travelers. They're highly dependent tourism questionable long maintain one Chevy.

But nice try, ""kid"" love man, little wink 2:00 keep smile face whilst answering ridiculous questions far beneath testament character suggests schools can't reopen unless strict safety measures place minimal community spread.

Totally agree. sometimes thank God flying spaghetti monster that.

But man glad live Europe look Covid19 cases case reason Sweden, vaccination rate children 97%, lot people (think read 1/3 somewhere) afraid taking vaccines currently development.

Taking Pandemrix better choice taking back then, since H1N1 killed lot young people without pre-existing medical conditions. lot kids dead lot worse getting narcolepsy.

But since covid-19 mostly killing old, think lot parents reluctant giving kids rushed vaccine, might make herd immunity harder reach.

It might non existing problem, since first batch vaccine hopefully given ones greatest risk dying. define ? mean threshold admitted hospital is? heathcare setting - need hospital care ? 100 hrs means working almost 15hrs days, 7 hrs week.

Swedens economy seeing 4% decline. average Sweden's economy twice good European countries Corona (in Elon actually pretty retarded. think people starting wake fact. someone made ton money, admittedly created cool companies, make super genius. talks quirky futurist, make super genius. constantly talks scope, even scope, makes tons basic scientific errors. really, point, far separated anything science really businessman, stop commenting ever actually scientist himself... since wasn't, ever. Neither 2 making suggestions. Neither medical experts ITT: 90% reasonable people sad offended this, 10% people believe deserved dared speak someone public. Sorry say supporting company keeps making gas cars going harm world supporting one whose CEO makes stupid comments Twitter. Good idea. Claim symptoms, use sick leave, isolate two weeks take close schools. Yeah, switch region updating numbers daily. every days nothing indicate data collected one day several when... beyond absurd Im kind, negligent upend system middle pandemic... unreal. Hell ploy That's insurance for. Why? things rust over? Machines evaporate? floor turns lava? explain much. Elon bad. Bill good It’s pipe dream likely winds winter coming out. dream. Buddhists Jews evangelize. know rest. 

But convince people experience eternal hell take another culture's beliefs inherently wrong kind colonial thinking [has proven devastating many local stories freak out. “I never left house unless getting groceries caught it.” Good luck everything. Heal quick thoroughly. donate plasma! That's true pretty much anyone. position would probably act way does. billionaire bashing BS tiring. downvoted someone political agenda reality that's SAD.

we hard data now: really get pick ""economy public health"" get pick ""shitty economy"" ""shitty economy PLUS sick nation"". Sweden went option two. America largely well. :( 2uhhzh cant vote wearing mask!

Good know! Bill Gates stick countless ridiculous computer updates, terrible search engines selling user information profit. article try imply? Lol 
It funny kinda tries frame Trump's side bad light tho.

But support Trump, join anti-trump train :D rights...to care hurt people? enjoy goalpost moving again. provided evidence, links, sources al said.

And you? counter didn’t realize English first language.

Weak pathetic. hope learn debate issues future, embarrassing yourself. Daddy Bill back foreigner Tokyo I'm used voluntary lockdown OBON! haha Yes, responded another comment time Gates saying right thing: always listen experts ignore big names media I’ve saving Model 3 feels like forever, he’s absolute moron year far can’t deny competitive advantage supercharger network, think I’m okay one VW’s ID models Nissan Ariya. 

I’m ready buy another couple years anyways. Pinellas county here. wouldn’t know, haven’t left house since March cause it’s getting worse worse. trump virus?  Germany, South Korea, Canada, Netherlands, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Ireland, UK, Finland, Iceland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden, Israel, Estonia. 


And way military family 6 generations service know hard America fought quickly people like send us die corporate interests. Tim Apple* Push back year, don’t lose election anti China candidates Sad see genius succumb hubris Musk recent years. once, ""it's rocket science"" admonition. That's completely different field man, actually know everything. Dude. That's scary paranoid. may want look getting help cause sound normal healthy Guys? dangerous sams club right pandemic? dad 70 years old went today secretly. I’ve told time time go grocery stores risks. I’ve bought everything needs asks every week so. didn’t even get anything importance. I’m scared could’ve gotten Sick there. Neglecting serious consequences COVID, think would close camp anyways. Half kids sick. feel like point camp ruined sake camp. Sadly consequences quite high. really get people trying open like this. love Dr. Fauci. professional trust whole epidemic. know would without him. Work target 727, it’s fucked here, stay inside Oligarchs largest outbreak meat packing plant?  I've factory talked multiple employees, love it. work asses off, enjoy part, least ones I've talked to. 


Elon cunt though, denying that!  wear glasses already, absolutely not. Mask enough I’ll stay home confirm, also American. Wait read POTUS tweets, traveling Europe USA 2 hours. honestly feel Gates would decent president make vaccines still hire street &amp; train people. Oops...meant .8

Yes...0 .8 data range impossible work with. arw supposed make sense range starting 0?

You took high range. could take 0. means ""wasn't"" according many public health authorities. would know bought bings instead googles. Right? They're simping Corona-Chan. Aggressive PR, he's funny meme man billionaire! folks playing game.

Republicans playing game one else wants play. even offered prolong game week. people worry financial situation another week good bad news comes. gracious. let use pepper spray rubber bullets want anti-maskers? grew there, 22 years, never go back. know stupid, stupid. dime lol End year effective. Fauci saying 2021 widely available. actually distribute need national plan, think know that's going go....

Fauci actually seen raw data phases knows interpret it, words hold little weight regard. dumb comment... totally conservative trick false equivalency. whole “good people side”.  It’s beyond disingenuous try equate Musk Gates this. load crap. That's first time I've clicked link, expecting Rickrolled, instead, found terrifying truth quote, real. Well, looks like time join /r/preppers sub. much explanation want? Serious question, I'm sure *how much* info type.

The gist processes types facilities feed products back reactants, pieces equipment take weeks come operating temp/pressure stabilize, tools require month long qualification procedures they're running order process product, etc. Tons equipment can't handle lack attention, lack power, lack feedstock. Modern factories plants often run razor thin margins, especially semiconductor plants every single piece equipment touches wafer 60 day window fab needs precise dimension smaller human eye detect. Much equipment cannot sustain 15-30s loss power without requiring week's worth maintenance (which costs thousands, addition manpower cost). entire inventory in-progress wafers would scrapped, immediately bankrupting many smaller fabs. everything slowly vents atmosphere, equipment restarted qualified like coming maintenance event, hard enough manage selected pieces equipment time, much less thousands individual tools. list goes on. cost starting everything back scratch obscene. wish could give examples numbers, we're talking tens hundreds millions dollars restart single semiconductor facility lost power minutes, much less one shuttered 3 months, much less industries depend semiconductors made factories. cascading effect unreal. can't afford shut down. economy can't afford shut down, ""lots people work"" sense, ""our entire global technology economy collapsed overnight"" sense

I'd like take moment reiterate places could running skeleton crew on-site personnel everyone else WFH furloughed necessary. shutting completely completely different phenomenon several orders magnitude Yes, agree denialism, borderlining extremism. Gee... shocked... shocked discover feds anything less honest perfection. keeping luxury electric car factory open, risking employees publics safety going help climate change?  guess we're gonna gloss Gates acted 80s 90s? Aparatus  Wow. That's pretty depressing. Eh. plenty reasons shit Sweden doubt delay look better, mostly cause done exact opposite past.

The lag caused Swedens decentralized frankly kinda messy set healthcare system. Basically death go bunch steps gets statistics. aim high PhD viable 2nd career sports. that's absolutely disingenuous. 

if took studies seriously college instead spoonfed grades, would've got backup plan. “At camp, teenage staff member developed symptoms June 22 — day campers arrived — left next day. June 24, teen’s coronavirus test result came back positive, officials began sending attendees home. camp officially closed June 27.”

At least 260 597 campers staff tested positive... took 5-6 days. really don’t see way schools stay open. Hell, even wanted open don’t see *keep* open. admit can’t done least winter break/2nd semester. 

MLB can’t even get right they’re adults living bubble. really expect 600 kids single school better? Yeah, Republicans get wishlist threaten people like usually budget? ...to Kodak RCA (insert obsolete company here) think advertising people, PR, etc ones worship spread shit morons. Yeah, huge problem sad effective Reddit usually. true Sweden's strat bad strat would places. even Sweden's socialized healthcare system, still resort [inappropriate triage elderly keep severe strain ICUs Swedish strategy Brazil strategy: mass graves poors gated neighborhoods rich.

Well said, agreed. bad strategy Sweden, disastrous strategy countries without accessible health care system (such US). want get charged attempted murder, infect store. right infect products , air, etc....it's public space everyone medical condition people's business. 

Breathing germs onto things others etc...invades everyone's personal space, including respiratory system, etc........that's gross violation definitely steps boundaries. Lol actually believe Sun real? Lol.

Boycott Tesla. even good quality assurance lot getting ripped buying inflated piece junk. Wait real auto companies offer electric cars douchebag gets grounded reality. Two thousand, shitfactor two thousand.

Why choose 30years rolling average? choose 50years, 100 years even 500 years would average uncomfortable outliers even more.

The reason statistics look figure come conclusions.

Sweden 7.9k cases per 1mio, 568deaths per 1mio.
Norway 1.7k cases per 1mio, 47deaths per 1mio.

Lets forget interpretations. look size numbers. agree 7.9k higher 1.7k? agree 568 higher 47?

I assume answer yes questions.

These deaths could avoided. alot sick people could avoided getting sick. people gotten sick unknown sequelae large impact quality life god knows long. 

With regards excess mortality, see this. Conclusion svt(national broadcast) 30% overall excess mortality 100% peak regions. Lol ok strawman. That’s exactly said..  people don’t things know sure it’s safe them. Erring side caution pithy saying. absolutely science evidence suggesting otherwise! kids fine shouldn’t forced wear masks deplete oxygen supply either! /s contact tracing completed determined student zero contacts.   

damn must feel bad local news tells everyone friends sure mean, what's wrong making sure employees get paid decent/living wage making sure companies put people front CEO bonus money? two seriously banned words?  probably enough impress employees ever single boss they've worked understand even basic concepts.

No doubt *could* guy BA Econ MBA running engineering company. See many think Intel floundering hard lately. infuriating cases first started rise Florida listening people saying, ""but death rate going tho."" Well yes, that's reflective cases going prior month. really think people drop dead soon tests come positive??

Ugh, people dense.    People wrong. irresponsible beginning shows. Heck, even show would've irresponsible.

Still, Sweden getting along nicely now. That's definitely good thing. watching end American exceptionalism? people trouble paying rent hard time believing easily get loans. 2007 happened know.  barely even pay attention says Tesla.

Which means came comments stir shit up. son (incoming HS Frosh) would like remote rest high school possible pretty open it. absolutely do. sorta stuff depends store. likely I'd go get tested instead two week quarantine Thank GOD CIA overthrows democratically elected governments cheaper bananas. Thank GOD armed middle eastern terrorists worry soviets.  turns pretending everything back normal work. Can't bluff virus. many years come ACA alternative still utterly incompetent actually governing.

Spoiler alert: that's lie tell moderates lefties shut up. ones know know want nothing done want skip paying insurance completely. read definition hospital care always binary.  sake people America, deleted.

China short (3 weeks), strict country shutdown. AFAIK country banned people going home shutdown. Even Italy, high death rate, allowed people still go buy groceries. Wait, old study (March-Mid-April) followed 9 students 9 staff virus Australia. 

That's really, really small sample size. 

Moreover, could draw conclusion kids spread study, could ALSO draw conclusion adults spread (again, half tiny sample size adults). 

Moreover, found lack transmission high schools, know high-school-age people transmit virus (and again, adult staff members).

You could worded dozen different ways probably would ended true statement, but..... 

Words. Have. Meaning. entire aircraft industry tanking right now. recently offered nrw position got let go weeks later. taking 8 weeks furlough. one flying buying aircraft right now.

Our shop went seeing 10+ planes week 1 week last 2 weeks worked. 70% employees furlough. take years industry recover again.

Exactly. Similar issue herd immunity antibodies. can't afford options. New York highest death rate. 

Shutting changed that.

The huge surge cases led death toll caused demographics travel, international funnel airports extreme population density NYC. response state governments NJ NY fast, faster, state facing growth rate cases. look stubborn FL response. And, none states locked residents. shut non-essentials. “Must 21 Covid Positive enter.” Exactly. lot contractors know we're expecting work go hard ramping people need way work done homes meant summer long term getaways virus. Lumber tools selling like hotcakes. DNC rejected universal healthcare part platform fat lot good would done. That's point I'm going explaining everything, every tool is, use etc. takes 2x long training mention politicians use threat another lockdown populations ""misbehave"" ignoring lockdowns avoiding overwhelming hospitals + allowing virus spread overtime (which EXACTLY populations doing). well places like Melbourne entering second lockdown already despite fact hospitals never ever overwhelmed number cases deaths abysmally low. need Walter White times. commercials indicative hardware store/lumberyard quality. Wait Black Friday becomes Red Friday.  retailers make majority revenue day (week?).

Considering large brands already decided close Thanksgiving, whether anyone opens friday, ""deals"" going DEALS.

RIP delivery drivers holiday season. Congrats! Belsnickel must found admirable last year. someone who’s currently working retail, yeah. hit nail head. I’m sure much long keep Texas? I’m outside Texas never heard this. store told us can’t enforce masks start. Damn, reading Lowe’s sounds like lot others. Definitely earned business work Home Depot. We're best financial year we've long time. store cleared projected sales plan first half 2020 20%. Saw stat today stock price increase Jeff Besos made 7.6 billion dollars within 2 hour window morning :) ""can't afford"" Target like, $200 Well please consider share holders trying times.

/S MA, every store I’ve gone into, admittedly isn’t many, 100% employees I’ve seen wearing masks properly. reason 100k per week never materialised lack sick people test. Obviously 300 cases day. need 100 000 tests per week.

While guess could charitably call ""lack resources."" rather doubt would agree calling ""snafu."" even freedom plain old arrogance entitlement I'm sure they're deciding wearing mask necessary either. outbreaks rising number continue country long morons allowed lie. election represents orange baboon baby man enablers stay power. means whether US gets collapses weight Russia swoop buy debt make certain Moscow despot happy. fact orange baboon would sell country cover whatever him, would let millions die suffer found out, issue. needs ousted end shit get back non-reality show episode never aired. *insert shocked Pikachu face* stint ICU clinging life barely able breathe week sharpen focus pretty quickly recover. +1 xkcd really apply.

Yang 2028 already happens. honestly think we've real democracy long time. Votes seem matter people power decide end matter what. least try hide though.

Delaying election completely would blantant. honestly, past 4 years happen guess wont surprised. Everything kinda feels hopeless tbh.  elaborate that? equidistant (like everyone else). long others wearing masks you’ll fine idea social-welfare government funded/subsidised healthcare means socialist-state needs stop. 

Ok Americans confused socialism communism. Americans call socialism reality communism. European call socialism reality socialism...
Americans know difference. social benefits still capitalistic country. 
I Belgian, one biggest party long remember ""socialist party"". want communism, want social programs keeping capitalistic society. 
So yes, agree you, Europe socio-liberal countries americans ones mistaken socialism is. European, AOC Bernie socialist leaning sometimes even left full communist. 
I think another big problem Americans realize programs cost. Belgium, ""free"" heathcare ""free"" education except free... seems free pay income taxes (we pay 52% anything earn 45,000 € / year. think americans willing face level taxation afford all. 

Anyway, 10% people Belgium voted socialist party (PS) always part coalition leading country... yes socialist mix liberal country. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Wealth little lack cooperation Careful say comment might get deleted 🙄 think top comment article Fauci testifying addressed strange data numbers...

Edit: comment God-emperor Amazon, I'd offer $2000 cash bonus option one share preferred stock strike price $1000. really. variety reasons Corbyn probably least electable candidate either two main parties fielded since Michael Howard.

The reason even put forward coup within Labour party lead niche interest groups. far cross-party support goes, worse Bernie. “What surprise”, said one ever. think would good country long term lot restaurants ended closing good. already eat like shit. It’s economic transition sure, healthy one people spending home projects cooking eating shit restaurants. suck worst restaurants us like chains fast food survive, maybe shift habits hurts long term too.  love sports fuck many teams get sick call season? Apparently they'll reschedule. US government health insurance industry donors: That's feature bug suckers!

BTW one person running president wanted Americans healthcare tied employment status. win apparently people thought secure jobs wanted keep status quo going.

It's almost like offered gift help us get coming covid 19 worldwide shitstorm America said naw fuck it. lots poor people go without healthcare. give shit. therefore knowing coming right around corner, sealed fate.

Like joke guy thought God would save flood waters kept turning help God sent. sent help turned too. get try survive terrible choice. invited nation's top infectious disease expert; matter become famous infectious disease pandemic?

Why team Trump continuously attacking best experts field promoting people hired Trump-supporting Super Pac make speech steps supreme court? Wow, get Vermont one smallest states really famous cities makes little easier understand, knowing whole country blows mind. PuLl PlUg poorly managed bars restaurants go under. well managed placed buy hopefully entire system improve. test fiscal management. American elections exactly epitome Democracy, mention even people vote still harmed this. Maybe looking places consistently horrible leaders every branch every party entire country analysis way ""the citizens stupid lazy"" something. soon read it, knew shit lot deeper expected, felt kinda queasy.

The feeling never went away. smart, pretend dumb, contrast trump Lets send bunch bars see good thing is!  read graphs correctly? says that, beginning data now, -1% difference workplace mobility 

Yes, workplace mobility decreased, always INCREASED BACK baseline multiple times. mean people would stop going work, whatever reason, start going BACK couple days later. 

Making net difference workplace mobility -1%. And, looking cases Sweden, see graph doesn’t mimic front back workplace mobility, suggesting two elements aren’t strongly correlated agree, think everyone needs stay home, including essential workers, couple months. I'm essential worker never got stay home make tik tok videos. Shut down! Everyone, least couple months. beat virus! Damn, years ago switched Home Depot guy Lowe’s guy again. business give money proudly. Home Depot rough history. believe current CEO better, personally think could more. He's donated lot money BLM movements Covid efforts, HD valued hundred billion growing incredible rate. company donated barely drop bucket. they've done great, I'll bet could lot more. That's steal. I've got $10,500 family deductible high copays too. premiums 15 years ago third 15 years ago, deductible half amount. mean, essentially catastrophic plans hope never need use.

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Likewise, work social safety net corner cardboard sign, look guy's comment history. He's one put flu. think vast majority players who've opted thus far basically bubble terms making roster (31 opted thus far handful basically locks starter year). non-guaranteed contracts may paid times $150k $350k stipend would've paid depending risk level cut season started, likely would've made less money. opt now, contracts toll (meaning carry next season). essence, get guaranteed payment contract opting rather rolling dice hoping make team get paid later.

Undrafted rookies get stipend who've opted yet I've seen. They're basically situation play order get paid year. Getting cut playing mean thing financially ""only"" thing they're really risking beyond normal season getting infected (which obviously could real negative consequences regards career I'm sure alternative fight millions Americans job right different sector sound appealing guarantee getting infected either). going whether like not. think government send men women suits persuade differently. even recommendation. authorities claiming masks useless, even contribute infection.

I think ever mask recommendation Sweden. Authorities want even elderly care homes. situation, related note: I'm pulling hair. graduated masters cinematography, I've day played major productions school. Managed squeeze butt good indies w/ established professionals. literally means nothing now.

p.s. body quivers think professors going right now. can't imagine going making like, 100g year work sight salary professor cut half (that's happened school).\*\* Wonder they'll provide sterile immunity. googled, seems actually billion, around $1.1 billion. much, yes everyone's economy getting hit hard. Americans want economy bounce back need get themselves.

Of course, won't. Sadly put others risk, starting medics nurses. Reading. lumber doubled, materials projects, backyard gardening, hobby work doubled According employees they're receiving trucks anyone's ever seen, shelves stay bare

comprehension suppliers cannot keep up

It's actually both. Even supply busy help everyone right amount workers store. keep shelves full even shortage.

Plus suppliers really backed others giving us regular deliveries slightly delayed. suppliers either.

Edit: also suppliers finding ways keep sending shitty products made rush, store double amount last year June July feeling we'll also returns. seen recent data? NHC updated heading west initially thought Home Depot ending it’s corona bonus workers week😒 got mine taxed 40%

*They* didn't. cost Amazon $500, got got choose handle taxes much government charges Payroll taxes (Taxes Amazon required pay addition money pay employee). taxes fund social welfare programs like Social Security Medicare, etc. lot people strongly dislike state income taxes well, business work paying tax money pay you, also paying tax money recieving. Essentially money receiving work double taxed. May: 

**Conclusions relevance:** Among patients hospitalized metropolitan New York COVID-19, treatment hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, both, compared neither treatment, significantly associated differences in-hospital mortality. However, interpretation findings may limited observational design. Anarchy usually involve state-endorsed thugs beating abducting people Players often short careers, outside positions. some, NFL paychecks cover decades outside careers, part reason pay get high. asking devote lives leading NFL 3 4 years play. Nope, really actually knew anything Corbyn. Least electable candidate we've decades. think recall worse leader opposition. ""Amazon"" ""can't afford"" immediately equals bullshit *we need put masks, socially distance, stay possible. “Employees company finally given reasonable share profits” sucknado. lot unhelpful speculation. lot stores/teams also experiencing shortage people due factors, lot team members working tons hours and/or pick slack literal pandemic, stores part enjoying healthy year year comps. 

Which couple years ago would fine profit sharing system place called gainsharing, working harder maintaining sales rewarded, gutted new amazing $15/hr starting pay introduced. Along couple things.

But hey, least jobs! confirm. Employees told busiest days store history several times pandemic. I've personally spent close 2 grand since March household projects. “I believe would disappear it’s highly transmissible virus,” Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, told House Select Subcommittee hearing containing coronavirus outbreak. “It unlikely going disappear.”

WHO made similar comments explaining vaccines several viruses viruses still us despite vaccine.

But whether disappears political issue we're allowed discuss so

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ obviously, thought sarcasm QUITE clear use comically terrible grammar clearly not. Yeah something like HS car accident really damaged social fabric town, that's thought it. Everybody loves comeback covid.  Lol. Nice phrasing parents driving Kentucky early 90s stopped gas station. attendant looked license plate said slowly: ""On-ta-ri-a.... Ain't never heard state before!"". told Canada and, word lie, said ""Ain't never heard state either!""  fuck 2020 thinking “yeah, totally seems like good time try cruise ship again”?  Depends go Texas, though. work large suburban fire department coworker waited almost 20 days result. It’s crazy. also fear uncomfortable change.

You might know system fucked national healthcare answer, maybe worked hard get good position; got good employer private insurance granting access high quality care add current need like children need treatment chronic illness. case even know change would better, might uncomfortable personally near term. changes might cut exact facilities happy access moment possibly lump new system lower level care.

If status quo working personally hard motivated change it. Shutting effect would time. may take longer work. strictly enforced abided though. ironic opposite definitely happening. weird coincidence Florida experiencing record high deaths pneumonia flu along COVID19 cases. Experts compared 2 viruses, similar traits.
The Oxford vaccine RNA/DNA vaccine, also genetically modified caused majority participants side effects. Although side effects mostly mild, still experimental think currently (?) viral vector vaccines approved humans. I'm vaccines, like approval rushed. Holy shit little subreddit actually hilarious. like echo chamber willful ignorance.

The title favourite part. ""Free-thinkers resisting New Normal"".

Keep free thinking chugging along matey, careful hurt it! I’ve gotten 3 bonuses believe instead $2 increase retail stores have. Unfortunately part timers get half full timers do. work 35 hours I’m still “part time “. I’ve lost $450 bonuses. Always been


*Loads glock lowes store too. made us delivery super jaded ended leaving. could literally either side. mean CRW-CoV2 vaccine? Shh, don’t tell anybody, buuuut, CRW stands Chernobyl River Water. Don’t say anything. side coin - take disease seriously, wear mask everywhere go, et cetera. work requires office. bad allergies, past 3 weeks I've persistent sore throat. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like point, I'm going initial symptoms (hope never catch it, do) I'll think allergies? point stay home? 

&amp;#x200B;

I know Mayor took seriously not, sounded like got tested allergy meds work, empathize side. Ive living Lowes since March much even one employees asked Aisle live on. craziness died now, March/April/May absolute mad house try get hardware supplies. It’s huge bummer. fucking love Home Depot using 20 years. love Husky brand HD exclusives.

But house Lowe’s family now, cool work benches aren’t trade Trump. vaccines designed produce antibodies, studies show last months. 
Again, don’t know anything sure! one does! posts trying convey wary rest hopes vaccines good enough able say “pandemic over”. hear teachers writing wills also. Gee, professional athletes participating activity could cripple life end career WRONG PERSON BREATHES NEAR THEM. 


Shocking. Silly. know blue paper least porous. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* think forgot critical thinking.

Fauci's terrible first pitch fine least nobody could catch it, MLB response conduct games safely major issue. trump administration thrives chaos division. Sending good vibes Texas. I'm gonna start using phrase English. know good. anti-mask realm opinion. realm ""we issue recommendations sake issuing without knowing effective be"". Even Sweden Tegnell said masks likely help public transport people cannot keep much distance possible investigate placing recommendation help people start returning holidays. effective public transport mean effective public situations. Denmark issuing wide recommendation public use either. Multiple schools teachers professional development find covid there. can't wait go back week own... least students going virtual. No. grocery store company thing, though smaller. gave $400/$200 respectively. taxes, really much considering deal right now, mention risk we're since require customers wear masks. appreciate gesture, like come on. go motions giving crap. I'm advocating violence.

But tell you, historically, riots persuasive. people think:

The numbers inflated

Because people protesting large groups means Covid isn’t really big concern 

It disappear November. it’s politicized.  mean #1 time now, really news unfortunately. course greedy fucktards still open. 30 billion dollars year enough! need make least 30.5!! FOOL!! wonder happen Tom Brady ends positve it. another Flordia team all. recent former employee would like correct errors Increased hourly workers pay

Maybe pay got increased, store saw regular yearly raise march. average ~.30 cents increase. month giving hourly employees bonuses also

This also false. since January given 3 bonuses directly Covid 19. part timers saw 150 full timers saw 300.

Most stores also get separate bonus, making sales surpassing goals lot almost every store.

The reason sales high Lowe's takes zero Covid-19 precautions seriously. offer mouth service, try say part. took advantage businesses closed sell non-essential items lockdown. enforce distancing,masks sanitation way. 

Ask around r/lowes sub handled Covid everything else. plenty happy paint much accurate picture. think taps problem (too many) Americans, climate change anything *less than* Day Tomorrow, COVID pandemic *less than* World War Z, clearly ""hoaxes"".  zero consideration long game.  
 talking friend, state early modeling showed, exponential spread, would several hundred thousand cases 2 weeks shutdowns mitigation efforts put place. things, severely flattened curve. virus run unchecked throughout country, almost everyone would taking dead seriously. things needed tamper spread, worked, also allowed idiots conspiracy theories flourish.  basically took early precautionary measures turned detriment road. Sometimes seems like simply can't win. sad thing is, capitalist monopolies exist soon punish Lowe's exemplary company. either lose money overtaken. Ah cool, nothing like favorite team making headlines wrong reasons. 

I hope everyone safe Cardinals Brewers side. Yeah everyone voted certain political slant believes that... like we’re Russian KKK grand wizards too. I'm jealous lol work grocery store got extra money time lol. much around house :( Face mask single effective preventive measure spread COVID, available us right now, enabling semblance normal activity. don’t understand objection use daily life. glad right Japan widely used accepted. Reagan method!

Unemployment look bad change way measure it! county surrounding county NC, clay Cherokee. sheriffs made public announcements mask mandate would enforced people pretty much whatever want here. sadly...many many people dont give shit anymore. ""fatigue"" virus. like...2 3 months MAX AMOUNT caring people have, overall. pathetic sad. wonder species made far. LMFAO. people around area wearing gear less less. people EVER before. EVER. absolutely swarmed everywhere. 

people care anymore. American hockey fan, grew playing Michigan, kinda like NHL shunned US playing Canada right now. homeowner I’ve never Lowe’s pandemic Well articles first grand scheme looking data 50% get long term issues. pretty sure asymptomatic mild symptoms won’t need go hospital. studies looking specific group people admitted hospital. Unfortunately, crab. prepared crabs pull back pot way out. Thanks playing! Accurate assumption. Availability spray bottles:

HD Lowe's.

Otherwise agree. Every Lowe's out, HD plus kind buy. Really? continue shutter stores, outlined article (just 51 closed last year). guess cost savings too, point Macy's JCPenny ""cost saving"" struggling? I've thinking athletes sense they'll chose protect valuable asset refuse play. guaranteed complications based numbers.  Oh ruled self-defense getting kicked body-slammed can't even listen Redfield. scum liar. Players preexisting conditions considered high risk COVID-19 get $350,000 get $150,000.

That part must nice HCQ overwhelmingly safe. studied decades Covid-19 ever thing. given tens millions people decades. CDC reports whopping SIX total deaths associated HCQ use entire history use. documents deaths associated HCQ use recent study. HCQ known safe. Cut crap. Lowe’s business home projects Wouldn’t fight people. Exactly. 

Best case Americans split half, top replaced trump loyalists. 

We fucked. Can't interpreted ventilator sign things \*more\* critical since best medical practice avoid ventilator possible use alternative treatments. case count many places super high march april, six month lockdown make sure didn’t enforcement it.

It's usually unenforceable. close businesses, can't stop people hanging friends family. Right?! college graduation boring fuck like 3 hours long went parents really wanted go. know anyone wants bad sit graduation deadly pandemic 👀 Good - NFL basically tangible plans protect players ""don't swap jerseys game"". argument athletes super-healthy means nothing know long-term effects COVID. need rip band-aid postpone season indefinitely (same CFB). Works people Agreed. Costco Liquors here. Lol read RT, came Google appreciate link case come across another RT article future. would shutdown masks work well? U can't both!

We need shut becuz many ppl wont wear them. yes, both. businesses shut down, ppl still go outside. thing stupid is:

why would trump administration pay covid death reported, time trying pretend virus reopen economy open schools? US one highest mask wearing rates btw. turns country/county isn’t hard hit dont wear mask, in... say California, who’s worst, maybe wear mask. 

It’s rocket science, people likely protect know might get Covid, grandma, suuuuper religious pro trump, yet wears mask gloves course Denmark discuss Controlled Burn strategy open, current actions opening cases double sends clear message. 

 ""We manage cases, remove limitations dampen spread.""

That's Controlled Burn looks like. Texan R3pvblic@ns? Unlikely. special breed. Bruh, connection Madonna, would working hospital trying avoid paying cleaning supplies they're expensive. news month ago things like MSNBC, CNN, google Trump President Xi, might able find it. always thought weird Mad Max call ""guzzolene,"" Australians generally call petrol? would people post-COVID19-wasteland Australia suddenly start calling petrol corrupted version word gasoline instead? r/Coronavirus... let us discuss.

(Sorry, thinking ""Clean face mask guzzolene!"" would fit right coming weird warlord character Mad Max.) took lot “sexy time” get today species. don’t see world run rats outnumber us million one. think major part problem people know much system sucks use it.

I coworkers ""loved"" Aetna. paid everything. mean, pull bullshit paying annual checkup maybe sinus infection something.

But eventually run things. One coworker pay $13k pocket Aetna considered kid's tonsil removal ""medically unnecessary"". Another spend months switching medications prove one already knew work, work, Aetna pay one works. Another called check specialist network, still ends thousand dollar bill.

So group people working for, they're unhappy. happens gradually, different points time, never critical mass. still people certain Aetna great they've personally never problem getting coverage minimal issues, despite heard Jim Amanda complaining surprise bills.

And even this, people still thinking within system. ""Ugh, Blue Cross much better. wish still that."" working relatively small group even believe problem, convince small group problem small fixable thing (we need different provider), need convince system that's issue. know law. illegal corner someone like nurse within full legal right defend himself.

There things authoritarian governments democracies can't, like locking people houses.

There also things like keeping bars restaurants closed indoor seating democracies could done longer.

Then there's ""human""/societal/cultural element touching on, Japan Sweden advantage culture normally distanced non individualistic.

Three employees wearing mask nose. group four stood discussing could wear mask Dr note, someone could call would check box without Dr note. really insist cured hydroxiuselessquine probably No, won’t.

Amazon pay FICA payroll taxes wages bonuses paid employees lol, nice one!! Sweden mask mandate **many Swedes** voluntarily openly wear masks.

Oh yea shit crazy. stop assuming things wait facts take knowledge Sweden longer Covid crisis like rest world.. that’s fact right Germany local shutdowns part NRW.

Also, they've 440 COVID cases 7 deaths. coincidentally, president approval rating 73% vs. president's 40%...hmm. basically virus keep spreading either everyone gets vaccine people refuse get vaccine die eventually catching year year? happens dies? VP nutcase like him? go elections? government start take seriously? people panic? mean, revamping HVAC system would expensive, opening windows? open windows, fans blowing air others, pretty cheap way ventilate space. problem livable wage. that’s whole battle needs tackled, it’s becoming glaringly obvious pandemic… obvious even powers can’t ignore much longer.


What people stay home take care elderly parents sick children?

What lost jobs live immunocompromised partners?

I appreciate care live Social Security. I’m assuming include disabled SSDI well. people voluntarily social distanced, wore masks, etc.

If phrase like imples wore masks, even remotely true. GCJHS says parent’s allow kids go school if:

  student direct contact (less 6 feet apart, 15 minutes greater, regardless face covering) person positive COVID-19 last 14 days OR
  student directed healthcare professional health department quarantine isolation 
  student following symptoms: temperature greater 99.5, new worsening cough, shortness breath, sore throat, repeated shaking chills, new onset loss taste smell, fatigue, runny nose congestion, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting diarrhea OR
  student received COVID testing reason yet received results test.


See CRITICAL TYPO. list students go school. list ""parent’s allow kids go school""

With kind attention detail, miracle catch virus. ""players making 10x field""

For majority players true. League minimum rookie half-million, average career NFL three years. players making 10x, making 2x.

lol!!!  Bill Gates get bullet too. conspiracy nutjobs start rallying behind this, I'm anti-fascist, anti-racist, market socialist. he's fucking politician fact warned protests mean places like California shut 2 months. virus still came back strong. delays things. isn’t bad, it’s unsustainable. state going bankrupt. That's you. Nobunaga's Ambition favorite.  Well, slow good! Wonderful job, huh? going mask mandate, open bars start parties make one might die. covering millions cases back February, imagine real numbers far horrifying show public. isolated cases bad decisions incompentent doctors/nurses ≠ euthanasia program  China also better coordinated response pandemic though. U.S. taken “every man himself” approach. cases may plateaued reasons, like backlogs testing.  can't even second wave even finished 1st lol Arthur done wrong? work Home Depot amount crap people heave company Bernie Marcus donated Trump absurd.

Arthur teddy bear cares people billionaires know of. also politically pretty opposite Bernie. 5700 deaths counting Lol literally sub alone bunch naive people celebrating prematurely weeks ago, saying little cases good containing virus. knew would bite bullet sometime. wonder now? IANAL, I'm going \66. furlough (reduction hours) considered qualifying life event employee stop change his/her health insurance life insurance furlough leave impact employee health coverage. Therefore, changes employee's health coverage would allowed based solely furlough leave \67. employees stop change contributions health care dependent care flexible spending accounts result question two answers Spending Account Health Care: Employees would allowed modify health coverage based mandatory furlough. AB 511, furlough leave considered work day (or portion work day) purposes except salary. Therefore, impact employee eligibility Spending Account Dependent Care: Employees enrolled Dependent Care FSA would allowed reduce Dependent Care election. Qualifying Event would employee's need Dependent Care furlough leave longer \68. part-time employee lose his/her health coverage result furlough leave reducing his/her hours 80 hrs AB 511, furlough leave considered work day (or portion work day) purposes except salary. employee reduction hours (below 80), result furlough, employee's health coverage would continue usual.

So employee can't change health plan, employer can't change health coverage part-time employee, assume employer cannot change health plan employee.

Now law effect apply, [law states worst eligible COBRA help situations? Loss coverage due reduction hours termination employment COBRA qualifying event allows plan participants continue coverage plan (typically 18 months). Federal COBRA applies employers 20 employees, however, states COBRA laws (known “Mini COBRA” laws) require employers fewer 20 employees also offer continuation coverage. includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada.

Which sucks more, much full hospital bills, assuming family qualify Medicaid anything.

If could remained original plan, law firm says contributions work like premiums paid paycheck? Even furloughed employee stay plan due stability period plan amendment, employees’ share premium must still paid. employee’s share health plan premiums collected payroll deductions, employer need communicate employees collect premiums one three ways: (1) employees prepay premiums, (2) employees pay monthly go, (3) employees pay premiums return work. literally said back then. aim herd immunity. *did*, however, mention herd immunity possibility lot. aim herd immunity.

But making point obliviousness exceptionally nice hand benefited (and parents.)

No one said anything fault. imagine living wealthiest society history, somehow can't educate enough people havr sense personal responsibly, even feed 1 5 innocent children. (It's anthropologists would call less-developed, pre-civilized society).

That's sad scenario, properly educated, *personally responsible* adult would agree.

Edit add: suggesting starve children punish poor uneducated people entire tenure utilized political skill get things done benefit public health.

ROFL! Discouraging (ad hoc/DIY) mask use right needed **not** benefit public seriously think favored healthcare workers PPE? They're among short list crucial, unable call in, unable avoid work people pandemic.

2) obviously complete misreading guy saying denouncing genocide. makes wonder 2021 look, time rebuilding shit? don’t disagree you, don’t ignore one party objectively fascist nothing happen party dies.

We need ranked choice voting. Many democrats support that. republicans do. It’s possible independent third party candidates achieve victory electoral process changes.

Same principle applies subset parents demands masks - private schools threatened loss tuition; public schools funded based attendance. whole idea flattening curve goes uuuuuup little, stays pretty flat, goes down. went uuuup little, declared virus over, went lot. missed part cases decrease first half assed lockdown begin with.

Edit: FURTHERMORE, testing, contact tracing, kind response near strong enough support reopening. know people take half course antibiotics stop cause feel better? fuck think would happen? equally correct say Elon alright massacre 11 million people commit multiple serial killings.

Do make sure processed food eat contains poisonous additives inspecting facility manufactured? Clearly not. rely USDA FDA enforce food safety regulations.

Do take medication? run clinical trials ensure medicine supposed without unwanted side effects? Clearly not. rely FDA review Implementation drug.

You clearly drink tap water run ""a"" test, often run water quality tests? verify weekly monthly basis water city gives safe drink? fucking doubt it. Also, information, arsenic reach dangerous levels groundwater. That's test regularly. would know rely government tell water clean.

why think meme kids love reason I’m sending child back classroom. sanitize surfaces space desks put plexiglass barriers day long, windows classroom far know, nothing installed like UV light HVAC system clean air. Several things wrong kind thinking.
1. Cars huge positive impacts lives, covid not.
2. worldwide trying slow spread covid, side, people drive.
3. Carcrashes flood hospitals, covid does.
4. deahs covid would much much higher treated like flu deaths could much much higher.
5. Many deaths reported daily deaths probably significantly higher. suppose useful counter rather ambitious goals like Oregon teachers want zero cases schools open, perhaps? surprising number parents, particular mothers, children ""investment."" expect return mothers. often get husband, sometimes work husband supports them, day, kids hopefully well ""pay parents back.""

I even kidding. course people want kids around. barely tolerate they're home school, think want deal day? Women marry affluence hire nannies take care kids day, even though ""stay home moms,"" lol! absolute ghouls.

edit: *not* say love kids, main motivation necessarily love. Well season climbing they'll need new markers! Wow got morbid! 

As someone trekked twice (and Khumbu cough twice) exactly first class medical facilities there. Everyone crowds teahouses night, takes one person Rona start wildfire there. ""what exactly would say here..."" fact first thing see source reads ""we fact-check stories posted here"", second information two months date bode well.

Eh. picked first Google link. WSJ editorial well (the second hit). I'm sure many more, flyspeck information may accurate, question information posted instead or, perhaps, NEJM, CDC website itself.

I think that's kind information would CDC's website. certainly expect CDC things COVID-19 shown cause MISC-C children ages 2-15. know contagious viruses similar effects, influenza viral pneumonia.

Influenza must effect killing 1 200,000 kids catches it. idea effect die make fact remains, children risk. Yes, higher chance surviving, bowl 100 skittles front you, 1 covered toxin would kill you, would risk grabbing handful? Would let child? would pass it.

Well, point already eating skittles. kids already eating skittles (out bowl 3 skittles covered killer toxin). we're talking schools, eat skittles measurably probably permanently disadvantaged scholastic endeavors.

We need nuanced understanding people make decisions make.

She parents pandemic deniers. obsessively participate sub federal government provided lot conflicting data. virus poorly understood children health care workers realize seem single intelligent entity offering medical community guidelines. Bill Gates didnt offer medical expertise call doctor wrong? Elon Musk that. Weird. said 4 days ago werent. Ill definitely take one seriously thing guy named kid something like, says person. feel Bill Gates donated $45.5 billion dollars charitable causes, including billions dollars alone fight COVID-19? wonder could make submarines teslas save everyone again.

Our modern office buildings apartments, part, would unlivable without (they build good cross ventilation) we're really acclimated it, part, take away middle worst summer.. can't cope.

Also, plain getting hotter. Jante Law says aren't. some...it exists..but compared countries. Nope. look / least honest.

Billionaires version ""Shut dribble"" promote enforce political agendas. elected pandering local politics important enforcing laws.  Bill's foundation, like every billionaire foundation, spends little possible actual charity, rest stashed invested stock markets, tax free. 

I feel like sounds like bombastic claim without evidence prove itself. I'm assuming provide objective citations definitively prove accusation? 👏 someone ask ""how much cost covid-19""? heard 10,000 $ per day per patient. good deal. ask ""How much money hospital make? "" Yea sure. Broken people like me? said 25% increase trash every day. workers clearly worked. don’t see striking going fix that. paying make happy enough overwork fine, need hire people pick fine too. Like it’s sanitation’s company’s fault. Stores: Go in, avoid people, get stuff, leave. Everyone mask whole time.

Bars: Go in, stay long time, make point interacting many people possible. single mask sight.

I'm terrified teachers. 
For one - cases school (crosses fingers please!) teachers humiliated fear mongering... Aka job expressing concern children.

If get cases, many teachers work quarantine get pay cut teaching limited hours online. 

Also, get cases, parents taking seriously turn around insist job properly sanitize 20 different children care.

OK... Illuminati used HAARP create hurricane lower testing numbers 

Wake people Thats misunderstanding. 40 people ICU, around 210 hospitalized. Prevents Coronavirus grow third arm middle back. least able use useless shirts pocket back though. /S facts masks thing Sweden (or Scandinavia. Denmark might change bit seems, Sweden might too). 


Facts even less 4% wore masks April/March, numbers started go down. Hospitalizations, ICU admittance, deaths per day going down. 


You base argument wrong facts rendering whole argument null. void. factory

I think looking big picture here. give shit Tesla especially give shit Musk. Closing factories 3 months obliterates, beyond recognition, form sophisticated manufacturing. closing one factory destroys world economy, many factories across world cannot withstand 3 month shutdown. ""pay CEOs less"" kind way. I'm talking ""fundamentally unable continue operate"" kind way.

Fuck Musk. Fuck Tesla. Fuck factories. acting like closing manufacturing sites 3 months viable option insane. could absolutely run skeleton crew, though, done. literally shutting down? GG, can't afford re-open. Oil refineries, chemical plants, semiconductor factories, etc. Completely destroyed. Total fucking anarchy across entire globe. busy. don’t money go - assume listed bunch places you’ve never visited? Smart. sound generally depressed w life’s outcome. Doubt location would change much.

   You’re referencing Henry Ford Health System study. multiple studies right haven’t demonstrated clinically significant effect. 

Please stop putting words mouth. didn’t ever say incorrect. said study referencing SARS, fact different coronavirus. I’m saying HCQ *could not* effective, peer-reviewed study adequate controls sample size would necessary convincing. study flawed results cannot considered reliable need studies properly conducted justify treatment decisions. Ultimately, presume actually assume percentage kids infected nearly 100%, kids live households parents grandparents.

They're playing numbers game apparently decided deaths (of definitely some) acceptable casualties.

Would nice they'd least admit it. fair give somebody minor ""win"", even false one, they'll willing hear points. maybe musky bois stan somebody would throw well extra unit sold, gotta try, right? /r/boneappletea Home Depot vs Rona vs Home Hardware get ELI5 support nah.

 Lowes near me. Tying healthcare coverage job one absolute moronic ways offer it. Lose job, screwed. COBRA absolute slap face anyone losing job. ""You lost job, want health insurance continue coverage $1200/mo"". Lucky you. I'd cautious, [the Trump took control SARS-CoV-2 data hospitals weeks ago. They're obviously illogical enough manipulate data rapidly, someone mentioned [another post's top lot states rapidly trending upward, stalled randomly July 15th, falling, significant reason behind it. 

It's safe assume continue safety measures follow CDC guidelines vaccine even months till majority people immunized, whether numbers true.  first person respond wrong! Read story.  Can't increasing corona virus cases everyone's dead corona virus friend plans full remote learning, says he's feeling guilty due ""but kids need socialize!"" crowd. told he's going feel much guilty family die.

I asked wife feels said - Oh, definitely home schooling them.  much strands nonsense.

1. Yes infect spread prepubescent children. 

2. Yes children get symptoms want get it.

3. No, vast majority population- children otherwise- resistant protected cross immunity [insert explanation]. 40+% week stratospheric, indicates resistance all. Haha greetings fellow nyer Queens real shout New York one time. sure did. Maybe never sleep... agree 100% we’re adapting change that’s progressive conscious decision isn’t it?

I spread time see loved ones good time amongst right Given severity situation I’m content right now. wish rest nation can’t sacrifice pretty basic shit, find couple real friends socialize within reason. 

But seems rest nation doesn’t share discipline. say we’re 100% woods yet; it’s freaky hell going anywhere seeing everyone masks like weird surgeon-halloween themed event. heat doesn’t make easier global warming another thread. 

Peace, blessings, easy brother Empire State mind!  It's... not... rushed... Shaken.. stirred. Yah There's different wording going around. 

Here Fauci says ""prove effective"". 

That means enough phase 3 data say effective not. 

After (may) need wait data come finish phase. need write data up. need submit approval. gets approved, distributed out. last part take long time get everyone.


Most seem think know vaccines effective late fall/winter, approval sometime jab/Feb, roll masses throughout rest 2021. countries (USA example) already invested making doses 30-40+ million ready go approved. Hanlon's Razor: ""Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity.""

Hanlon's Razor apply experts domain.

It's reasonable expect someone without background subject operates way less ideal, one *is* expert failures attributed ignorance must result malpractice malice. also started cutting RSUs/stock awards raised minimum wage FCs. No, mask on. Plus, she’s 54, young, elderly either.

She’d recently liver transplant strong immunosuppressants. That’s 54 year old woman cane wearing mask told cunt broke leg pull mask up. didn’t raise cane cunt lady started threatening her.

As always, non mask wearer escalated situation gratuitous violence. said listen programmer referred Musk actually... knowing anything Gates, well fact admire guy business career also ONG. even tho man smart almost always responsible (let's forget court multiple monopoly issues) never going learning actual expert odd many comments saying ""bill stick operating systems"" reality, part development team modern operating system. 

He ran company created operating systems. last 15+ years he's run foundation fights disease.

He likely knows much fighting disease ever creating operating system. feds regulating data begin with? can't hospitals say hell throw spreadsheet online? Didn’t say anything wrong w striving continuous improvement. said I’d want born anywhere else choice. Would you?

How every major tech company invented? know meant. freedom culture innovation best class. UK elected Boris. probably got beat majority elected grade school. Wimbeldon thing: people charge Shaw Festival, Winbledon, made great call. Nearly one wants first rushed vaccine. No, bet would paid enough. stick fucking night sky, Musk seems best. fuckstick. even saying lol?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's many nutcases days, can't even ask someone show common courtesy, without consider might assault asking. won’t open long though. Unfortunately ones starting first test rest country goes back (which many battles, won’t). virtually certain least adults sleeping cabins kids staffers sleeping way wear masks bed.

It's impossible spread came adults, would hard narrow down.

I also skeptical idea kids spread it. ""Who going listen ? Scientists? Doctors? Peer reviewed studies? **OR ?!** "" - Donald trump Medical Professionals usually emergency fund liquidity survive 6 months year without work. Suppose live at-risk person. Would bump

 Minding business breathing openly spreading nasty germs air onto products...the floor...the people. ...etc.  no. exactly nothing...or minding business. 

Minding business means wearing mask keeping sh!t much possible.... don't.

But also recognize Bill Gates ""just regular billionaire."" man one wealthy people planet. 

Even he's giving away *a fraction* wealth (and using rest enrich guise charity)...that's still ***leaps bounds*** beyond philanthropist. Last checked stepped CEO 2000, even board Microsoft. works full time Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, primary focus improving worldwide healthcare.

Feel free ""intellectually"" ignore that, though, pretend still live past works Microsoft, conservatives best. I'm sad children. JFC. Villages. like Florida Florida. contrary, I’d love read piece peer reviewed research suggests working home induces PTSD.

Why need explain again? lmao Think people care ""technical""? Yeah happens time. Like literally tens thousands times things keep going lot vacant houses market soon. That’s narcissistic sociopathic people tell themselves. project idea population say “well, they’d even chance.” gives permission act without conscious, even views outside civil society. 

You’ll see lot adulterers also using logic. line reasoning allows someone hold accountable anything, make imaginary people whatever want. It’s moral race bottom barrel. Absolutely, I'd shocked made way October. Every single place reopens schools going see ""a mysterious increase"" covid cases. kids teachers invariably end ICU, everyone cry: ONE COULD PREDICTED THIS!! Yeah OK cases people like ""oh nice Sweden cases let's travel there!"" go square one again. Norwegians Danes already invading south west.  People need stop thinking Elon kind lord savior. He's guy lucky one.

You go airwaves EVERY SINGLE DAY say ""THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE SUFFERING RIGHT MCCONNELL BRINGING VOTE UP.""

Then go McConnell's district run ads EVERY SINGLE DAY saying he's reason we're suffering, find donors, blast reason we're suffering.

If McConnell bends, great, we've proven beating stick (politically) works.

If bend poll results go down, we've proven get anyone power fighting 98% country represented pro-elite bills.

Republicans want block it, Dems say right things (public option, single payer) IMMEDIATELY abandon honestly heart fight. American people get screwed regardless.

One side give shit, side cares enough say right things.

I would urge think people complaining country. (always) think US worst country world across board. generally want better country. 

People want leave, want complain. complain want us better, think can. It’s romanticization young Gen Z’ers. They’re easily brainwashed “tells like is” like memes constant appearances pewdiepie’s channel.  Try submit link politics issue.  say “already submitted “

Since post form blocks submission time, won’t see post submitted. :) dumb. Can’t find link isn’t demon sperm doctor involved lawsuit New Orleans covid19 death? Yeah. That’s works. think need test assume confirmed don’t.  masturbate business. every local subreddit shilling Swedish approach right one take, willing adopt huge welfare state universal healthcare long it. Without Swedish strategy Brazil strategy: mass graves poors gated neighborhoods rich. bit glamorous that, ultimately. Plus, summer Georgia. (Which summer live, Alabama).

They mentioned elsewhere mitigation implement ""opening doors windows extra ventilation.""
