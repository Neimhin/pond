someone who's got disability otherwise neurodivergent gonna fuckin strut around talking epic something like  Scott Morrison get tell states do. Scott Morrison get tell states do. trained, might well keep kids home safe then. getting real education point. statement truly shows lack value see teachers think school secretary suitable year round replacement. New state mandate goes effect Oct. bad Earlier. Yeah, there's nothing could done. supposed do, order multiple vaccines large numbers? Reading article skimming places sound alike Taiwan simply getting various orders vaccines fulfilled relying donation. Looks like half 10 mil doses far donated US, Japan 3% population fully vaccinated. Almost half gotten first jab though. Covid taken seriously Oregon, especially Portland. still dealing massive surge suuucks. think could prevented lot people dying better response, particularly beginning, we'd still point covid major concern. Delta equivalently infectious variant would still emerged we'd well short like ~90% acquired immunity seems needed. Fix headline. 

Continued high rates COVID-19 lead worse shortages healthcare workers before. 1) Several vaccines boosters. new thing. 

2) vaccines required entry school aren’t diseases **currently causing global pandemic**. It’s circulating much higher frequency. 

3) one getting boosters “every 5 months”. RT here.....covid suuucks. shift draining.  Yes, I'm talking businesses enforcing masks, enforcing patron restrictions, corporate employees working office instead home. tons measures abandoned pursuit almighty dollar. Someone infected walking past another person Australia. Previously experts assumed someone would need another person 15 seconds. 5-10. shotsgiving then, guess.  fully agree suggestion administration pandering unvaccinated. one hand, think administration reactive, proactive, pandemic far. said, would suggest done? damned do, damned don't. Fauci, CDC, administration largely ignored unvaccinated, difficult quantify number people (just like people look news two weeks elections vote, ""undecided"" ignorant voter, focused daily life), would ultimately gotten vaccinated. unfortunately, similar game chicken playing climate change, can't get pandemic control *without* getting largely everyone vaccinated. can't it-- long large part population remains susceptible unvaccinated, number people spreading virus great. also creates tinder virus able mutate, thus raising odds escapes vaccines. blame administration pushing *everyone* get vaccinated. Thinking group vaccinated people pandemic completely needs stop-- kind messaging certainly placed squarely Biden administration (eg. ""the pandemic unvaccinated""). right come Reddit news  pains dumb medical announcements would air commercial breaks ""ow, balls!"" mean ones actually deny science, right?  Face it, blame walk - burnout not. Dealing people could fine stupid infuriating. Probably (like Eastern Europe) high vaccine hesitancy means Czechia vaccines people willing vaccinated. feel like age twisted information, newsletter related social media posts appear erroneously conflate two different ways FDA regulating Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine.

They begin element truth, twist native. element technically true, resistant bring debunked. is. ***NEW*** delta strain. im honestly betting 2 million americans dead covid dust settles. already pushing 1 million current estimates 630k+ confirmed. husband Americans currently living abroad. received second covid shots March. return country residence next week there’s current information regarding boosters made appointments cvs get booster tomorrow, first shot based questionnaire. making huge
Mistake? feel guilty also want make sure date since read timeline would changing 5 months would next months us  Scattershot approach. Post lies everywhere, take called it, leave everywhere else. Delta Eddie Bauer Edition come pairs. 1.) morons deep south Yeah would help preventing future pandemics claim hoax blame vaccine. Sadly I'm seeing happen.  hope goes through. Covid not, going great way get problematic children idiot parents away education system. Quite welcome... please note dramatically edited original comment responded; overall conclusion (that study's authors misrepresented conclusions), but, made errors since corrected. Would easier require vaccines eligible.  want expose what’s really going everywhere. don’t know press hasn’t gotten hold anything yet. It’s insane. scary. Everybody told can’t speak don’t. don’t want risk fired losing license. don’t want blacklisted. hounded press get sued. Nobody wants that. wish would report goings actually film stuff.

Oh forgot-they use metrics quality-patient satisfaction. metrics be-are better before. Well, didn’t take long… Ayo photo sus wtf time CDC FDA proved incompetent releasing information public. much medicalese PR releases last time people wrote interacted hoi polloi apparently sacking Carthage.

There's reason Presidential candidates speak middle school verbiage campaign trail. People collectively dumb. viral loads vaccinated unvaccinated studies showing, matter employee vaccinated? Unless know whether unvaxxed likely get infected first place. Serious question, since haven’t seen studies saying one way yet. vaxxed less likely hospitalized. could imagine face looking much like mine heard it. many emotions “f*@k!!” followed defeated sigh. I’m glad see COVID morons uniquely American phenomenon. always like point ""We'll learn live virus"" crowd.

These doctors nurses **human beings** expected care sick. think unlimited capacity provide care?

Do expect doctors nurses plow like machines, caring endless tide sick?

It happen. They'll burn abandon rest us fates. going do? treat us gunpoint? don’t. want like minded opinions it. comment wasn’t uncivil factual. ""others"" put risk vaccinated? fuck'em

and technically, vaccinated people spread too.

...and I'm completely OK kind tiered system hospitals vaccinated people get preferential treatment unvaccinated.

...but again, people smoked whole life take bed treated lung cancer. Obese people take bed heart attacks 30's. ICU sends five texts day offering extra $1000/shift OT shift differential. 

That said, played golf today made tacos.

We’re tired.  I’ll ask min week. won’t 8 months baby born November. maybe breast milk pass along extra antibodies! First Ingraham, Fauci. Public figures never catch break journalists. There's literally question thread guy says called local health department, got statement vaccines, asked here, ""Is true?"" 

I kind wanted snarky tell ""Did try calling local health department?"" 

Of course true! lying you! would reason lie! even were, hell would trust random internet people word literal medical professionals! Come on! course young people need vaccines.Japanese governments screw up.It's like want vaccinated (There stupid anti-vaxxeres though).There enough vaccines here. Well envy situation, know I'd - I'd ask limit protecting kids. Would get divorce save lives? Yes.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep - schools opened 16th, 2 weeks. think we're getting kinder gentler covid future, sorry...

Unless virus evolves sense empathy  lol, data shows cases started go right around time schools started open, it’s crazy think schools impact data upcoming weeks. dickheads saying gotten control containment possible. Yeah can't say US much better. Grown adults can't something easier putting underwear order save peoples lives. profit? Sure, people hate anything perceive inconvenience, profit?  
Pretty sure argue people want shut went got vax. seriously think would done better something deadly plague?

Absolutely 100%. People scared shitless ebola. Part reason large swaths population don’t take Covid seriously don’t think it’s serious. something like plague came around don’t think 50% population half politicians would resolve act like acting face COVID. I’ll admit, I’m smart enough understand entire ins outs all. know it’s concern…. It’s disheartening go fauci saying it’s possible normalcy spring 2022 (if people continue vaccinating)….to this. wish every country better access vaccines mutations could become less whole bullshit pandemic could end wrong many ways, I'll child likely die car accident.
If could vaccinate car accidents, would you? sure hell would. kids wear seatbelts, drive safely, regularly avoid highways slower roads involve similar travel time. Cars dangerous one top causes death humans. would act like big deal?

Also important death poor metric covid outcomes. Children many direct, negative outcomes covid besides death. kids getting MIS-C dead. kids long covid dead. kids school weeks dead. kids hospital ventilators dead. vaccine prevents things, yet acting like death need worry covid?

Furthermore, vaccination protecting others well. Kids covid bring home infect older, diabetic parents. infect elderly, immune-compromised grandparents. Vaccinating children prevents illness death others, kids would want vaccinate children virus provides immunity catching vaccine?

Vaccination first, (inevitably) exposure second. vaccine prevents severe illness maximizing immunity either vaccine exposure would give alone. also effectively zero risk vaccine, still far lower small-ish risk direct covid damage children. best time plant tree 20 years ago. next best time now. importantly, people’s lives  teachers need carry liability insurance? Honest question, don’t know. know nurses personally pay carry insurance individually police?  frowned upon long term data it, corporations created legally liable negative impacts may later on.

I'm vaxxed still hesitations this. Anti-Covid sugar cubes Hospitals mandate flu shot decently UK, actually getting shots. meanwhile southern US, ICUs filling up. Huh? thought Delta “Made India” product. Cause remember people calling Indian variant initially cause 2nd wave Infia. That’s literally figured. downvoted saying that? make assumption. I'm wondering said could win. know. Ludacris suggestion find Kaiser premiums copay tend lower. everything one roof get better price control. people like want shop around specialty doctors stuff. Kaiser can't pick anything outside faculties. People want shut least restrict anything. 2001, stop 9/11, invest Facebook, google, youtube, among others. Maybe not. sure hell wouldn’t now, that’s sure. think it’d like there’s flu season every year. covid season, figure variant prominent vaccinate it. need teachers ignorant fools. I'd rather vaccinated school secretary stand front class kids read book. Nurses carry liability insurance could loose license practice consequence behavior. Police, simply, don’t. anytime screw found liable courts, it’s taxpayers district pay settlement. ‘union’ kind protection….? curious too. Apparently following CDC guidance matters sometimes?  Thankfully care ""think"". go data. guess explains multiple organ failure covid infected people. Cool cool. narrative ignore science what's convenient?

Everyone liar, part conspiracy, apparently. That's people fighting mandatory vaccination going lose. another fall/winter like last year, companies going enforce it. K-12, colleges going enforce it. society continue this. can't human race deserves may get. Oh, goodness. awful. Thank much do. can’t imagine you’re treated well right now. ♥️ Except delta care vaccines much close quarters like airports airplanes. See thought feel like fair game journalist. put name article, public facing ""I work Reuters"" twitter flatly advertises person. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like want feedback work, instead name, would written ""Reuters staff"" we've seen before. Better alternative.   It’s Tyee union funded far left publication. health care workers pretty bitter contract negotiations provincial government wages working conditions. Nurses Alberta already highest paid country want government cutting back etc. there’s angle article working on. saying everything wrong take grain salt context. Hospitals drop power consumption 40% dedicated life support equipment. Additionally, hospitals required 96 hour backup almost 2 (or 4, depending size hospitals) 800kWh. Regarding fuel supply; majority hospitals ‘reserve’ amount. Instance: 500 gallon tank last 96 hours. 500 hits 40% 15,000 tank starts refill 500 gallon tank. hospital start power backup generators first. Go hibernation mode start using fuel generator 96 hours. time larger fuel container refilling. hospital (Midwest area) run 40% 30 days. that? fucked hopefully help. possible create variant lab would unbelievably contagious incredibly mild 100% survivable release infect everyone push strains permanently ?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So, 361 kids dying largely preventable okay? Hopefully, FDA approval vaccine accelerates vaccination rate. Going Latino-heavy areas NYC approval, saw looooong lines people waiting get vaccinated pop-up sites, previously, even lines.  know makes sense. guess think everything opened yet people still getting sick and/or dying required proof vaccinations festival Lexington KY(usa) weekend. recent negative covid test. 2: Electric Boogaloo

I think that's *end times* variant.  (Lets try hope meets requirement auto moderator friendly)

TL;DR - Incompetence

Longer version:

Victoria undergo 112 day lockdown last year get outbreak hotel quarantine peaked 700+ cases/day zero. incredible sacrifice rest us.

NSW nailed mast lockdown contact tracing's good unlike specifically case point Victoria (though lockdown one corner Sydney due breach though luckily area three ways well people northern area actually prefer people coming - guess got stuck southern part Christmas last year?).

Anyway, NSW kept rolling dice contact tracing lost (you're big last success) lost big time. learned nothing every single time happened previously variation hotel quarantine and/or flight crews somewhere Australia ...

Car driver transporting overseas FedEx crew somehow vaccinated (and mandated), tested daily - (and checked happening) wearing mask (claims lot us sceptical).

Caught Delta flight crew superspread Eastern Sydney (guess live part week). NSW ulimate arbiters dithered 9 days (because they're Victoria lock like them) Delta time, contact tracing got totally overrun speed it. got Western Sydney people per home higher density less able work home red rover terms stamping out. long delay help either (it's Victoria's hanging NSW ultimately saw explosion cases).

Didn't least protect regional NSW (because Victoria) NSW lost control they're trying gaslight rest nation 'you can't keep learn live it'.

Given every state except Victoria (I'll get moment), left right either kept (or squashed mostly least NSW spectacular failure seedings), think they're telling us effect get bent, we'll open time schedule.

Victoria got contaminated NSW I'm livid especially went last year they're still hanging 100 cases/day (while NSW 1000).

I'm also livid evacuate parents (legally checking authorities) back regional NSW home town came Eastern Sydney vaccinations got trapped apartment June August (after 2020) left twice took Pfizer 1 Pfizer 2 (now isolating 2 weeks getting Covid tested today - someone brings home town, going us - one neighbours call police us luckily paperwork order - also person parents seen months get tested every week work - we'd really unlucky).

Anyway, TL;DR - NSW individuals running show bragging gold standard etc dropped ball dropped last place trying pull learn live vaccinate etc rest country said they're still zero/got zero we're good thanks PS: we're effect locking out.

Addendum: New Zealand slammed shut one confirmed case (sourced NSW) said effect ""We're NSW"" (They said 'Australia' everyone knows mean) fortunate given might pull elimination - Delta, it'd seeded lot time picked first case.

I think number parts Australia effect using NSW example eg: ACT totally surrounded NSW slammed shut almost 400 days cases moment found one Delta case hit dozens one point. think they'll also eliminate outbreak eventually.

I mean, sure point going vaccinate open (only country apart readily let people - ahead North Korea front apparently) planned it.

I think something controlled mind ... Thank you. Hopefully, get juice back that's up. society whole economy would suffer greatly ""closed"". want do? Shut businesses still even recovered? Tell people can't go see friends family? 

We need mandate vaccines much possible encourage people get them. continue wear masks try keep distance public indoor spaces. That's really point. remind blood first. abomination Bot? ( say comment stolen too) may not. may emerged right now, that's evidence shows. think proper terminology use would *Delta Two: Wrath Khan*. Thats means I’ve seen several public FB families pregnant women ICUs. last week 23% pregnant American women vaccinated. Really hoping numbers go might try find Moderna booster shot instead third Pfizer. reason continue Pfizer-BioNTech matter? No, there's going *something* big put Halloween, we're one departments that's impatient put stuff since things shut last year. Honey, headline implying anything. Perhaps inferring, that's going predisposition. headline says exactly means. new strain. Doctors believe bred festival. Nearly 2 years pandemic, know probably 99.9% exactly happened without headline implying anything. people went festival 52,000 chances breed new strain ones testing positive it, else headline say? She’s already second term.  virus present. article seriously suggesting Canada pursue covid zero approach? kids' district mask mandate full CDC recommended mitigations. 

There 3000 district (including employees) reported 8 positive cases first 7 days school. Obviously wish none far seem better ""masks optional"" places. Cause Covid going away we're going need learn live without destroying economy. IMO means vaccinating, taking precautions opening businesses again.  Child teaches adjacent school district. also weekly testing (finally) requiring staff vaccinated. totally agree. combination COVID US election shown ridiculous media gotten. Even subreddit it’s amazing turn nuanced discussion policy partisan bickering. common enemy, common goal, plenty scientists researchers working fast give us good data. polarisation fuelled fact anyone produce headline seemingly reinforcing point want make. Precisely. one wins. Every death America costs society, average, $300,000 lost productivity. Even retirees contribute childcare volunteer work. context question asked age-eligible students, full implication Fauci would support school mandates it’s authorized/approved (per another commenter, apparently public schools can’t mandate prior fda approval, I’m sure Fauci meant speaking EUA). American always become accustomed seeing well handled things Canada, kind shook reading friends kids schools absolutely nothing. really expect that. gonna ugly  Taking bets long takes reimpose restrictions. I’ll give month. think it’s underestimate since Covid results vascular deaths aren’t counted Covid places. Plus, there’s people dying long Covid heart failure months infected. R-eff dropped 6 1 week thanks Level 4 lockdown. numbers today may due low Sunday testing looks clear cases plateaued may peaked. Considering hit multiple superspreader events across city run wild 10 days detected, that's best result could hope for. Tell go CVS get it. That's mom do. second shot February. want wait longer. Thanks yeah, will. Masks indoors mandatory here. :-) Well could shoot gorilla But... Delta found India first? Honestly, lab leak completely change way handle viruses. Seeking huge samples unknown viruses bringing major population centers seem remotely worth risk. Trans men non-binary folks too. costs nothing inclusive. Good luck that.  know people trying bring class action local school district refusing mandate masks told kids actually got sick option legal recourse. sad come this. Well, believe vaccinating important, going want get done get divorce. papers filed, getting children vaccinated without joint agreement could cost custody children, depending judge overseeing case. Good luck. 

(I'm divorced parent who's ex agree vaccinate children.)  depends criteria select individual. Random individuals? Individuals equally exposed virus specific number days before? Individuals already symptoms? Individuals already sick? Winter who? first snow? first time put sweater? First time spot xmas decor store? drop something remotely mint Starbucks? First time hear Little drummer boy??? Dec 21st? Who’s definition using???
-a really frustrated parent. Delta 2: Electric Boogaloo What's taking USA long especially compared european nations access much later. lockdown extension announced risk areas. lifted boot yet. believe studies based antibody analysis likely false positives. Given rapid increase cases happened time fairly difficult imagine virus circulating internationally several additional months nobody noticed. school districts can’t require vaccine unless fully approved FDA, worries there.

While may turn true courts become involved, functionally true right now. 

I believe LAUSD Hoboken, NJ mandated vaccine 12+ students. suspect lawsuits follow, since fully approved 16+, knows. 

Upon reading article, appears Hoboken allow students enter negative PCR test week. Either proof forget too!! Sometimes compliment sisters masks cos matching coincidentally once, anti masker husband forgot also republican felt angry vibes. Gamma

Nothing drops like anchor. site provides interactive infographic variants timeline emergence. Nope, still die too. 13 year old nearby town day, co-morbidities. 

Maybe, maybe, children medical minority different biochemical processes, it’s worth assuming they’ll react adults, additional study happens take couple months. forgot level stupidly here. right, although sometimes politeness diffuse situation. would guess majority schools none precautions there. know state isn't. people care, infuriating!! feel bad parents want vaccinate kids, keep waiting. fuck talking about? Reuters owned Canadian holding company, Woodbridge Company. response comment removed...

A couple things - 

Fearlessness often reckless sometimes selfish.

Nobody knows whether fear death faced it. Lets see can't breathe putting ventilator induced coma know ever going wake up. 

Self-proclaimed fearlessness death measure toughness. Neither calling people pussies fear death.  experience people talk fearlessness often biggest cowards shit hits fan. 

Fear death integral part human's survival instinct. literally Darwinism. Survival fittest survival fearless. Facing fear, using moving forward measure courage, bullshit bravado not. days money enough. One top rated comments today mentioning Missouri much better 86% deaths per day compared beginning Month. look sound right...and turns worldometer daily death counts take weeks update compared sources.

Missouri actually double daily deaths compared beginning month. use Worldometer want know recent daily deaths, seems NYTimes probably others much date data death counts. think vast majority anti-vaxxers anti-vaxx principle political reasons. mRNA angle something push justification stance, offered non-mRNA vaccine would simply find another angle. Waiting 9/20 going make things worse. Open healthcare workers elderly now. Otherwise, we're going get stampede 9/20.  ""Many estimates predict R-naught Delta variant falling 6 8"" Perfect, little guy turns 5 Sept.  Technically Victoria Delta variant STALEMATE.  Children aren’t quite tiny adults. vaccine come, it’ll take time development. Although vaccines abundant US aren’t elsewhere, timing may also come priorities. Bless heart.  teacher taught virtually good portion last year parent elementary kids also virtual, yes no. Kids definitely move school day, think weight gain constant snacking. I’d find food wrappers kids’ rooms (we don’t eat bedrooms…), kids would come class bowls pasta, bags takeout, giant cups soda. bored kitchens nearby…. many parents (me included) busy working monitor every move). 

I spoke pediatrician kids’ checkups, definitely saw many kids. hope easing back regular schedules mealtimes activity helps kids lose extra weight. Summer outside definitely helpful kids, imagine good number others return healthy weights well. last line exactly right. Maybe every time ask get together, could send post “COVID ate face” way saying no. I’m convinced seeing others direst circumstances persuaded. obviously don’t give shit (sorry, I’ve got I’m family, too), maybe ounce self-preservation. Good luck stay safe! Also mass execution pets tossing apartment windows single news story said pets may carry covid.  Lmao didn’t even make connection til comment Yes, probably bigger problem vents. get why, transparency would help. honestly, vaccinated nursing home residents dying, guess what: they're vulnerable, immunosuppressed. still need protect them. reinforce that. think politics optics. want appear countries certain way- share vaccine supply, US citizens get three places gotten any. complete lack concern us. Since start thing, everyone left fend themself. abomination, public health nightmare married politics/politicians. Anyone concerned go get third shot. Fuck anyone else says. life, health.   think antipsychotics might better bet that. Delta. much easier control outbreak 700 3 days someone catching virus spreading it, compared virus make person infectious within day.

Unfortunately, Victoria's contact tracing probably always one step behind virus within essential workers (meaning virus spread multiple workplaces even identify source). Delta changed game completely. Covid, fire, Ida, extra gasoline. ACIP meets tomorrow. supposed ones make vaccine recommendations CDC director. preempted White House announcement?

Clearly Sept. 20 date due logistics, eight months first vaccinated got 2nd dose, that's eight months comes from. Dr. Fauci said MTP today data shows vaccine efficacy started drop US mid-July, six months. Data Israel shows drop that, certainly six months. say data says booster eight months. Worldometer doesn’t update daily deaths timely manner…so sorry say Missouri lot worse would expect data. instance, look worldometer daily deaths Florida also shows recent sharp decrease 100 deaths day…meanwhile Florida closer 300 deaths day currently.

NYTimes current death data seen below…daily deaths double 30 days ago I’m boat. mom 6 months week pharmacy doctor give third dose. (74 years old, diabetes asthma). travel two weeks I’m terrified. also careful either. makes worse scared third dose 8 months. thinks CDC claims 8 months might scary side effects sooner. Yeah I'm teacher antivax/mask state would lie get 3rd, fear one one million bad reactions it'd insurance shitshow since I'd committing fraud. thought Delta used India variant? Spread outdoors short period time unlikely. well.  stuff deal NYC vaccine scares them?  time I've ever photo choice articles small weekly wrote stories laid paper.  happen matter teachers do. question public health. Hope talks boss Congress. I'm aware anywhere world controlled Covid (especially delta) without strong centralized action. people follow rules, grudgingly, believe make difference. need leaders actually step plate lead. Basically  Well see, there's group people double-blind study... bill introduced Texas legislature add Covid-19 vaccination required list ages eligible. also bill introduced prevent Covid-19 vaccination added required list schools. Guess one pass.  Burnout rate new teachers also ludicrously high. sometimes leads death spiral unqualified teachers hired fill spaces paperwork micromanagement try herd unqualified teachers, leads burnout, leads less qualified teachers hired, leads micromanagement, leads to... required either fully vaccinated recent negative test. Tell everyone don’t understand data one comment 👏  People dying hospital parking lot bad. Triage get kind care bad. We're already morgue trailers store bodies bad. standards chose standards. vaccinated residents thought enough. Everyone told vaccines prevent death. didn’t. It’s facility individual nothing that. follow guidelines wait guys aren’t special anyone else cooperating Seems like would thing comes around people spend times convincing others get vaccinated.  Fuck people march vaccines. I'm tired BS tired you. Correct wrong, thought vaccine 12 under? matter, antivenom like $100k per dose. world you. goes around, comes around. Anaphylactic reaction component mRNA vaccine? That's contraindication according CDC.   Rna levels =/= viral load. doubt ran plaque assays. need data infective virions, rna levels. vaccinated ppl, maybe viral rna, correct question ask ""what infective viral load."" referred among hospital staff Devon Cornwall **“festival variant”**, believed new strain Delta rather entirely new variant. 

Festival variant 🤦‍♂️ Meade County 39% fully vaccinated though massive number sick last fall winter many probably thought still immune didn’t need vaccine. bullshit since southern states going surge right people need protection right away. CDC needs report science stop screwing around trying figure sociological policy. I've lived life. put way: I've seen confederate flags.

We live Pacific Northwest. Maybe anti-vaxxers associate Fauci.  Can't even private school California. get required vaccinations, home schooling option. saying many many people unreasonably outraged tomorrow evening? 

What strange times live in. Truly one history books. Seems appropriate IMO long oxygen supplies last supply chain disruptions. I’m immunosuppressant got booster shot yesterday. second shot made super sick two days one even worse. Terrible headache, fever, chills, wild temperature swings (woke drenched sweat immediately felt freezing), nausea/vomiting, awful aches pains, I’m weak walk much bathroom feel like I’m going pass stand long. Hoping turn corner soon seems come waves. Anyway, everyone different hopefully y’all better booster experience me. hesitancy antivax disinformation direct conflict CDC advice. CDC holds vaccination safe pregnant women pose miscarriage risk. CDC holds pregnant women unborn children increased risk severe illness.

* 
* lies kill unborn children pregnant mothers.   Honestly think overly effective. Studies I've read say somewhere around 30% effective. also take account general public washing mask daily, touching mask putting (keep COVID hands), sanitizing hands touching mask prior touching anything else. Masks stop spread aerosol sneeze cough moisten mask? person readjust mask touch inside? many factors, normal us hospitals change masks patients, granted is/was shortage always possible, took precautions.

Now yes FLU almost null void year FLU season, hospital like 1 case. this, masking, distancing, quarantining, handwashing people cognizant hygiene covering coughs staying home sick, hell know. Expect seasonal surges regional. Warm weather states surges early spring late summer. surge protection CDC basing what's best half nation. Hospitalizations decrease medical professionals working unsustainable hours get burnt get infected themselves. given testing shortages, cases grow either. Covid solved! I'm pregnant vaccinated unfortunately posters saying true. heard many stories doctors expressing ambivalence vaccine pregnant women, especially earlier year. clear, **I furious doctors think dead wrong.** thing happening makes angry many healthcare providers failing pregnant women profoundly. turns tell British public daily death count forget expected strengthen like though. hottest ocean water world sitting right coast Louisiana general societal attitude toward teachers, meaning paying shit, treating like shit, acting like profession people lazy want summers off. watching teachers treated pandemic, think gonna get people profession. mean anti-venom help? I'm sorry really understand virology much. gotten vaccinated, problem. actively made choice actively try dissuade others getting vaccinated. 

If you’re vulnerable wearing N95 mask.    several festivals taking place weekend across UK far bigger Boardmasters 

Reading, Leeds, creamfields, points east amazing steep Meade County case rise year compared weeks 2020 rally. 2020 county averaging two cases day rally opening two weeks end averaging 19. year opening day averaged new 2 cases last year Meade County averaging 39 new cases. shows contagious Delta especially since lot people county probably still immunity. Delta means need 3 doses higher percentage people vaccinated able get zerocovid least make endemic like Measles (which much contagious).

Shit show understandable though? mean, don’t know what’s going case, maybe judge nutjob. think would said, “Wait, discussed doctor, medical notes, get within hours.” it’s long enough she’s “‘sending care packages”, plenty, plenty time get doctor back up.

I can’t help think things going here, bottom line article click-bait. (And clicked it, shame me!)  Same, I'm surprised nobody else far mentioned thread. Vaccination status thing I'm comfortable inquiring criticizing folks on, overwhelming that's one simple, free thing could done stay alive. enough emotional energy left mourn months opportunity get vaccinated chose (US perspective here). health system risk overwhelmed. always goalpost. never happened Denmark unlikely too, probably safe. certain countries though.  going trouble bridging gap 137k excess deaths 670k uncounted COVID deaths vehicle fatalities flu deaths.

Maybe we're 1.5x high end. We're definitely 2x overrun official counts.  That’s I’m curious about. know people infected got vaccinated highest protection people covid vaccine apply people breakthrough infections? get breakthrough infection get natural antibodies well like would weren’t vaccinated?  food great operations run like clockwork. don’t like food that’s fine don’t eat there, don’t hater. Clear app phone demonstrate vaccination status.

We'll see winter goes. would make sense  probably are. company (a smaller biotech) 97% complete (1 JnJ 2 mRNA dose) vaccination rate. mandated vaccination on-site work week ago so, really basically already vaxed anyway.

I doubt AZ different. Hard work Pharma like science confidence therapies. seeing surge hospitalizations bad  mean, let's honest. straight meme-ing.

If we, society, truly believed profit everything would vaccine mandates every state, district, etc. Everyone would vaccinated could get economy running full bore again.

I'm office home remodeled. place straight ghost town. here, masked.

PLENTY places still practicing myriad restrictions. want get kids back school? Sure, we're mask mandates rather full virtual, there's much ask children protect idiots refuse vaccinate. Nobody said that? knew information far immune system works, specifically human immune systems tend respond specific virus specific spike protein based vaccines. actually see happens humans get data figure slowly quickly antibodies developed dwindle, developed all, cross fingers would develop long term adaptive memory based responses. Nothing guaranteed, every virus different immune systems respond, top humans slightly different immune system/response, good thing, means one really scary virus evades immune systems might evade since there's large variety, humanity likely survive even people die. making things, they're really unsure what's going get data thousands millions people long period time can't ethically research humans intentionally infect potentially deadly pathogens. way prevent weren't. contracted unvaccinated family members household (kids). also know several families whose kids got COVID vaccinated parents either never got never symptoms. Dude sound like antivaxxer. arguments make. ""What entire scientific community completely missed it??"" KFC/Taco Bell 30 mins away city done (Ontario, Canada). I’m sure reasoning. 

I’ve also done small town restaurant. Takeout going stong anyways, couldn’t bothered headaches Covid regulations regards reopening dining area. mean kitchen worry it’s less work, less drama less operating costs. 

Some day restrictions completely gone I’ll consider reopening dining area, it’ll never full service dining again. Fuck that. I’m happy way things running right now. That’s seems like can’t really find confirmation. Yeah, it’s sad point I’m suspicious people say can’t get vaccinated people actually can’t. baw wit da vid, da vid dat make sicky sicky story Texas day man died easily treatable gallstones turned away lack space.

Totally unique situation get it, often hear company telling employees go seek competitor's product? would told April 2020 we’d still dealing wouldn’t believed you- I’m honestly trying expectations point 😂 dropped masks, went offices, resumed 100% daily normal lives... numbers would lot different.

We'll see guess. mask mandates 2 months Denmark basically one wears anymore, everything back normal since start summer. We'll see data shows come winter. They're still gonna go McDonald's either use app use drive thru. numbers hurting. guy made living training people physically fit (older folks may even remember ""body life"" fitness book). 56 year old, first caught COVID-19 January 2020. 

Got covid summer hit hard. 2 months hospital. Barely could stand 3 people assisting him.

So question family member is: guy rich. He's got big beautiful house, big bank account, spouse devote time time helping rehab. rest us wealthy? would 2 months hospital financially? mention physically? (X) doubt not? Unless legitimate, documented reason can’t vaccinated beyond “I don’t wanna” “microchips” she’s showing irresponsible parent. McDonald's town went 12.50 10.00. Still great horrible area type work. vaccination status aside, shows cancels probably sparing public super spreader event. 

Call stereotyping like, chances average Kid Rock diehard fully vaccinated.... drug used CFS apparently. clinical trials starting they’re looking participants. stay cautiously optimistic. Especially considering someone close CFS (unsure whether it’s covid related) worst part reddit people whine downvotes That's correct. Sequencing long way past 1918, especially RNA virus like influenza.

Given influenza tends mutate faster coronaviruses, likely - can't prove based small number surviving samples 1918 influenza. (I believe researchers able recover bodies buried far enough north they'd frozen since 1918.) opinions unless mods agree right? tf wants sit eat inside mcdonalds? want enjoy big mac car, windows rolled keep shame inside Wish province (is Alberta). Apparently business requires mask someone sue business  Thanks lot explanation! That's exactly I'm questioning. way past whatever normalcy going people get immunity virus. Preferably vaccination, getting virus refuse that. 

If we're going mandate vaccines, outside things like schools businesses, we're not, way get exactly ""half measures"" allowing new waves start. strict measures lower keep spread, longer goes on. actual quickest way would restrictions, let virus spread like wildfire, get widespread immunity quickly possible. problem medical systems can't handle many sick people once. balancing act getting immunity quickly possible overloading hospital systems. that's going ""half measures"" enough immunity need measures. Yeah think whole idea “everyone get point care” really dangerous. people lived thought way got sick unfortunately. 

Edit: also stat true 10% people getting long haul everyone get covid eventually 700,000,000 long haulers hands… something ignored Tit tat, US refused remove EU countries red zone list travel restrictions, many US states far worse European countries, time return ""favor"". wish Alberta government saying people sue business 🤷‍♀️ Crazy downvoted mainstream expert opinion. say ""Pfizer Moderna"" reads breakthrough cases among vaccines compared say, J+J.

so shit... Eh varies. Idk subs I’ve seen lots brigading lately, often usernames always talking points. It’s common regional subs (cities/provinces/countries/universities). 

Some ones I’ve seen subs shown nonsense too, worst get moderated. They’re always good subs unfortunately.  Thats useful! Thanks 😊 Sadly second shot. kids situation school started month ago. School sends form emails every time kid class/bus/lunchroom tests positive.  I've gotten two emails far today school's 3 hours. Last week notified us school ""outbreak"" means two cases linked could come school. 

One kids vaccinated, young. KN95s. 

My options switch fully online campus district (and stuck remainder school year) keep risking in-person classes. good options parents. Good luck you, Ooooh, seen talking about. many places last couple years (Toronto hella closed long while) remember lot sushi restaurants tablets table. vaguely recall ads menu items, I'm sure games such. technology fascinates me. cook, though, writing wall wonder they're gonna streamline side line newfangled tablet system. new hires getting confused they've never seen paper chit before. Even old guys, they've working assembly lines beeping screens McD's big chain ""casual fine dining"" Toronto Ottawa. grew small restaurants, stuff new still. world's-a-changing. I'm barely late twenties, people always told ""don't worry, we'll always want real people give us food coffee."" Oh yeah?

 think vastly underestimated much hate bothered unnecessary interaction. point, makes much easier charge advertise spending less. again, little guys get cut deal. Exactly lol. get vaccinated hopefully see like “immigrants taking vaccines need vaccinate them”. run get vaccines!    comma substitute word ""and"". don’t get it. parents checked paper homework decades ago make sure it. assignment minimum skate meant long talks, extra chores, loss fun things.

That's wild... actual reason lighting coincidence? get matter what.

""federal mandate bad, let states decide!""

""state mandate bad, let local districts decide!""

""local district decision bad, let state govs decide!"" Funeral directors want know one trick! Well thank god. I’d say like… Covid got   Thank you!  fantasy, would already build restaurant without drive thru first place? Tamiflu every covid treatment reduces risk 2-fold (more like 1.5-fold). vaccine booster ($10-20) appears reduce risk least 4-fold, probably like 10-fold.

Antivirals answer. teens (1 college, 1 hs) work one McD's report rather short-handed often close hour three early (like times week) enough people run place closing properly.  downplaying it. People permanently injured flu every year. Covid, especially recent variants, much worse flu. Even half people lying cause condition isn’t Covid, that’s still 3%. US, that’s 10 million people. 

Medical advances can’t cure lung scaring lot neurological diseases. Heart stuff possible depending expensive also likely life altering - perfect health thing past people. 

I guess I’m struggling see point. worked restaurants last year, actually saw decent (10-15%) increase total sales previous year even lobby closed year. also restaurant used 50/50% split dine drive through. There's another one SA starting reported first cropped July. Multiple mutations. Unlikely competitive Delta unknown able avoid current immune responses. dirty secret? cares shut inside profitable? That's business people need understand.

There's popular chicken place near me.. still drive thru shit down... inside dining area.. pretty much used storage... went thru today actually, thinking might never open costs associated... Plus lines usually around building... ever restaurant, always said I'd consider drive thru place, seems like everything much streamlined. care many people get COVID outcome infection par trial data.

I think mistaken here, trials cannot evaluate hospitalizations deaths. lack numbers. IIRC, Pifzer trial like 200 cases placebo arm dozen cases vaccine arm. numbers cannot evaluate protection severe disease. 

What think waiting vaccines still protect serious cases, public health goal. vaccinated people getting sniffles fine. 

I'm unsure later always case seems Israel vaccines also losing protection severe disease.  Really really strange nothing come yet. smoking sections, could hang meal.

Arby’s still stamped metal disposable ashtrays napkin holders sauce dispensers years McD’s Wendy’s banned smoking. two kids young vaccinated. School starts week school division decided masks classroom bus - awesome. 

Lunch served spacing requirements kids sitting shoulder shoulder across other. 30 minutes masks spacing. 

This pretty concerned. I'm overly comfortable arraignment. cases evened bit (no delta spike) live 45-50% vaccinated seems like terrible idea young kids. 

What thoughts setup?  think struggle see enforced government respecting private property rights forcing property owners harbor homeless?

I can’t speak Canada, city — enough shelter beds homeless population. However, go unused significant portion would rather live societal rules. So, city allowed unsanitary/drug fueled homeless encampments occupy premier public parks. I’m talking tents either, generators, TVs, name it. 

My city lacking different type enforcement— good times. world series poker required vaccination day. pros say make event harder. local fast food places never opened dining rooms back up. feel like part fact they're hard time getting people work pennies now, though. CDC also keeps releasing data showing breakthrough infections increasing time goes on. one dumbest takes I’ve seen while. said, I'm also one trying tell people share ffs $1000. get vaccinated. sixty days comply. Get vaccinated, get check. brainer. cost society continuing higher that. let play vaccinated. Treat like paying public. pace expect see numbers top start September slowly start drop bit. 

The numbers still insane keep growing. death rate keep making headlines, especial next couple weeks blow up. 1st shot 2nd shot?  2nd shot good.

Recent data summarized presentation CDC ACIP found 90.5% effectiveness symptomatic disease Pfizer starting 11 days dose 1 dose 2; goes even higher dose 2 decays back ~85-90%.  11 days basically zero (confidence interval wide straddles zero).

see slide 17 of: date ranges table cover week dose 2, number events study population probably small give meaningful effectiveness number). building's ventilation system spread virus around anyway? Eh probably would still provide bathrooms... Maybe? course! Plenty reposts, yes! Lol herd immunity won’t happen without making vaccination mandatory keep trying end sitting inside 20 minutes. That's insane.. every single fast food chair near trying hire signs saying average $15 hour. Yeah get that, conflicting info  know that. me?

I dont work school, go schools ""fun"" People STILL playing 2021? Talk giving fad long come gone can’t go meet people time still careful. There’s way careful live tours covid. CDC really waiting d'uh moment report findings. splinters even vaccine enthusiasts overly cautious vs. follow science crowds. first thought, doctor accredited hospital. doctor found online specializes snake oil.  link FDA That's good. become standard everywhere. Fax cover ass policy everywhere doctor privileges hospital, dispense administer medication. judge idiot. doctors refuse. Lawsuits next, appeal higher court. Dumb ass. Around 6 months  Except science backing third shot, isn’t coming CDC. that’s new, CDC forefront relevant scientific discovery pandemic. Israel’s data third shot looks pretty good far. It’s still early on, weighing costs vs benefits becomes pretty easy decision. Exactly. Reddit hardly biggest culprit covid lies lmao. site largely pro vaccine regardless subreddit. thing see people differ covid restrictions lockdowns. someone saying ""covid lies"" usually heavily downvoted. 

If want go someone banning covid lies go facebook, YouTube, Twitter, social media platforms.   removed 2 days second dose significant protection, though week would better. Get first dose asap though, that's starts timer.  No, shocked still mimum wage places 20 years.

Did think big number without thinking? Wait. answer that.

We need $25 minimum. actually shitload money. Anything less $15 rent home prices soared considered disgrace.  “I’m asking questions” 

The ""pro-science agrees us"" crowd conflated ""science questions everything"" ""repeating unproven allegations good."" &amp; we’re baccccck! think we're going get anywhere near 2000 deaths per day. think we're already close peak see us going 1200 per day summed distressingly well, yes. think strains called that, way dumbasses would go festival pandemic flock towards outbreaks enmasse, benevolently extricating human gene pool, making rational people little safer.  That's calculate effectiveness though. would need risk adjusted. example pre vaccine 100 people age 50 hospitalised every say 2000 cases (this completely made example demonstrate point) 10 hospitalisations 50. 

Lets say everyone 50+ got vaccinated one 50 got vaccinated. 2000 cases got 5 hospitalisations vaccinated people 10 unvaccinated people. wouldnt say 5/15 hospitalisation means vaccine 66% effective. would say 95% effective hospitalisations 50s reduced 100 5.

Basically without comparing control group unvaccinated people group similarly distributed vaccinated people cannot conclude efficacy. CDC access information believe laymen (unless theres data somewhere I'm aware of) might actually evidence it. 

You public education system dumbed down. fuck talking about?

You said statement. trouble reading?

I never said anything public education. you. talking great ‘dumbing-down’ ie “Idiocracy,” doesn’t *necessarily* anything education, public not. know this. see may different situation sit-down restaurant intended social drinking. cook, I'm expecting tablets able make food soon. France. Made plans late May looked like over. fun though. don’t data cuz CDC screwed didn’t collect proper breakthrough infection data. Israel data wish had. show need don’t. think it’s Israel screw like CDC did. Close schools vaccine ready. kids replaceable.  second shot made pretty sick wasn’t bad. really thought past worst woke middle night feeling absolutely freezing WORST shivers, despite fact drenched sweat, that’s took temperature saw high fever was. totally get you’re coming though- whole time kept thinking “damn wish didn’t this”.  August 23, 2021, 171 million people United States fully vaccinated COVID-19.


During time, CDC received reports 49 U.S. states territories 11,050 patients COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infection hospitalized died.

Almost people 65 older. 
People aged ≥65 years	1,801	(87%)	6,268	(70%)

That link decent explains details including footnotes. possibly worst time visit. Capacity restrictions, way many tourists understaffing holy trinity shitty experience  sub taken people saying masks &amp; distancing don’t anything, states lift restrictions, COVID surges places like LA NYC winter. Glad attitude gone part happen recently. Patient refused go vent. Demanded go home 02 sat 70s. signed waiver coded died hall. even despite later start Israel had, really seeing signs exponential case growth

Surely fits theory efficacy wanes time. Countries vaxxed population later would see efficacy wane later also. stepping older brother reccommendation game plan tell shes adopted dont answer door comes over.  

Seriously, would call moron building her. Good luck her. watch stupid shit shes going do, shes believing covid shes probably getting rest quanon shit.  Studies shown wearing mask effective even situations social distancing possible/perfect. can't account people they're premises

That's always going true. Given large enough data set, groups getting similar numbers would show wearing masks significant effect. Tbh, every country differently it’s still hard say tactic was/is best. Locking example guarantee US would much better place long run. 

I live country purposefully took path “we go far lockdowns change society much. result unhappy, mentally unhealthy populace. hard turn back change much societal fabric now”. 

And know, opinion right. 
There lot deaths country, still less countries. 
And go around, without masks basically everywhere, shops, restaurants, bars etc. things back normal-ish. 
That’s don’t really know best option was, since see several different tactics worked. 

I think politics really worst thing US tbh. 
You seem en enormous polarization late within country it’s basically two different countries now, one shits everything one does, includes idea taking vaccine. That’s problem is. lockdown timeframes. Everybody infected deserves vaccine.  think acceptable risk calculation allow grown adults would follow mask social distancing rules corporation 20 minutes,  reasonable school can't mandate anything governor says illegal mandate, forced go inside rather choose somewhere else eat, stay full day go home parents even closer contact. 

 In-person school important kid orphaned. lose perspective?  think 50% difference good, realistic, told someone December vaccines halved deaths, would generalized disappointment

UK around 5-10% deaths last peak, maybe difference Israel never many deaths begin with? (topped around 70 7-day average) Hawaii local here. Please come can.  go about, play games. I'd rather put skates meet friends sit around phones like indoors already, dinner table already, public already, get point. Different strokes different folks. Games meant played can't IMO, guess changes individual. mindset de facto *the* slippery slope. Since something forced upon people government, everything able long ""justify"" reason. article discusses immunocompromised people doesnt define considered immunocompromised. title misleading. Sorry, know sucks big time, fair assume sicker still without vaccinated. That's good. Novavax still apply EUA pfizer approved? Yes.   freaking lie! Wake people! mean doesn’t sort go ways? Like states banning mask mandates considered violating student/school rights, wouldn’t states enforcing mask mandates schools also violating said rights? Appears best legal solution schools decide. 

And means anti-masks schools, fact think elementary schools right especially them. sort wonder “can’t go one way” sort issue. would fucked either way. Remember covid months spread even heard it. First death(its probably earlier now) covid states December 2019. happening near me, local news stated he's day 7 21 day course. hospital doctors administering waived responsibility things go sideways. also said given 30 percent chance survival prior beginning it. Different strokes different folks. Playing game generally requires about, social, indoors via cheating probably game explains enjoy experience. I’m taking screenshot twice day compiling it. wait. means Novovax won’t approved EUA then?  No, it’s dining fast food restaurants isn’t exactly necessary and/or essential whereas in-person school incredibly important childhood development, “acceptable risk” two scenarios would understandably different I'm sure schools require vaccinations manage. unsolvable problem I'm sure think is. maintain teachers refuse get vaccinated shit good riddance them. astounding  thought happened. case? Brutal mean people don’t want work poverty wages. /s Oh good know. Still shit anyways wish, she'd probably give covid got close lol. actually mad Mom well ""being scared"" (Mom 60's, higher risk, smoked life, surrounded covid Florida, waiting booster). really sad situation, idk brain cells went tbh reach Variant Interest designation (which step Variant Concern), cases absolutely factor. genetic changes predicted known affect virus characteristics transmissibility, disease severity, immune escape, diagnostic therapeutic escape; 
Identified cause significant community transmission multiple COVID-19 clusters, multiple countries increasing relative prevalence alongside increasing number cases time, apparent epidemiological impacts suggest emerging risk global public health. fucking bloggers, lol. think is? 2003? last forever. vaccine changed dangerous catching virus drastically. There's telling lead, when, we've sorely wrong predicting headed pandemic many times year half. let mind convince knows we're fucked forever, inner panic voice know, one knows. Makes sense average anti-vax person lot dumber average vaccinated person.    hear you. can't personally watch us all, risky times. Salcedo, Ms Sena, Dr Herrera employed financial interest E25Bio, Inc, biotechnology company develops rapid tests infectious diseases. time study, Mr Harmon Dr Bosch employed E25Bio, Inc, financial interest company. disclosures reported. yes entirely correct effectiveness needs stratified risk age Life normal good. I've back work since May 2020, fully vaccinated since April 2021.

Haven't worn mask since June 15, except doctors office plane/in airport. South probably month behind last year going line exactly. Delta, vaccines, prior infections also provide nuance impact spread. Flu seasons always line either year year come waves different parts country different times. there's usually fairly predictable pattern.

I'm definitely saying 100% expect exact pattern COVID last year. saying need cautious assume Delta wave US. Based we've seen throughout whole event, case waves seem come go areas reasons completely understand.

Coincidentally not, today, Wisconsin, Ohio, Nebraska highest Rt values still rising US. Yeah first shot gave minor rash

To anyone gotten booster I'd say side effects midway point first second shots True, true. forget people wear whatever talk fitness Congrats antivaxxers, broke McDonalds.  Lots places done already. truck driver hard find food sometimes Given mutation rate likely true. akin extremely infectious influenza virus opposed measles. 

The best path forward appears inducing much immunity population possible yearly twice yearly booster shots provided order mitigate harm going forward. time, disease rendered less less harmful. Pandemics unfortunately end want end, continue current state forever. even aware started indoor seating. country one even thinks labor day gatherings lock down. Public gonna listen fantastic idea! drop everything, move country completely foreign language culture pursue career people notoriously unhappy! Unfortunately time know variant going become dominant, late already everywhere.

I agree Zero COVID advocates much, they're right one thing: way keep COVID keep out, basically treating every version virus long-feared vaccine-escape variant. that's possible (and think isn't) accept waves happen new strains spread everywhere.

Keeping eye variants useless buys time target policy characteristics variant. prevent variant taking fitness advantage. loved one died (of cancer) last year. told people died, first thing insensitive ones asked “of Covid?”

None caught Covid, spread virus anyone else theory asymptomatic infections. vaccinated young adults yes still low risk. Unless think lucky. would lock vaccine like 4 weeks ... Speaking older brother, apply Indian burns, noogies, garden hose sister goes screaming tell mom. Apply whichever seems appropriate. Good point.

Oh occasionally them. laugh governance show up. Viruses ""usually"" mutate become gentler us we're usually contagious start feel sick, feel sick, spread more.

Covid contagious symptoms, there's evolutionary pressure stay mild. Covid get better better replicating us without fear it'll make us sick spread it. That's new covid variant deadly last. think we're getting kinder gentler covid future, sorry... Yep. people told us March 2020 masks don’t work even increase risk catching COVID, told us couple months ago masks unnecessary you’re vaccinated take back weeks later. 

Their advice clearly based what’s best public policy, what’s best individual. Agree disagree.

Put leash virus.  muh freedoms!!! They're claiming 95% efficacy death due Delta, 71% efficacy hospitalization due Delta, seem omit efficacy data infection symptomatic infection, normal measure whether considered ""effective"" (greater 50% efficacy). find study, articles saying published. [NY Times couple weeks ago results announced news conference, ""the data yet peer-reviewed published scientific journal"".

J&amp;J's earlier study earlier variants found 93% effective hospitalization 14 days, 100% effective hospitalization 28 days, new data could seen drop efficacy.

A preprint independent laboratory study NYU found ""significantly decreased neutralization"" titers serum antibodies individuals immunized Ad26.COV2.S (J&amp;J), compared BNT162b2 (Pfizer) mRNA-1273 (Moderna), Delta Delta Plus.^(1) IC50 titers J&amp;J Delta Delta plus 30 41, mathematical modeling predicts 50% efficacy would correspond IC50 titer 69 higher. that's lab study, real world study.

But think stress/demands/hassles parenting - seem life-ruining compared kids - actually majority. sure, though, happens. point mortality rate much lower Covid plague. Covid deadly plague genuinely believe would worse.

When consider large percentages society refuse even accept existence, career politicians refusing act like leaders fear upsetting voter bases. Governments seriously failed inform educate people dangers virus. Businesses put profits people staff. 

I really think dealt awfully, maybe comparing plague bit far. seriously think would done better something deadly plague? peak r/aboringdystopia mean “culled”?  Anecdotes data. 

I accept pregnant people higher risk death, higher baseline IFR 0.5 0.8% ? 2x? 3x? 5x? 10x? 100x? 

Look, think OP'S friend vaccinated OP also writing unreasonable stuff. ""She would sad lost baby getting vaccine, least she'd alive!"". making sound like friend going get going die it. Um, first guaranteed get it. Second, even get it, OVERWHELMING odds would favor.

Anti-vaxxers tendency also anti-intellectual.... probably unvaccinated guess.

61 infected 40% among unvaccinated. \~25 unvaccinated getting sick. 80% residents vaccinated.

15-20 unvaccinated infected-residents 5 dead? Sounds right. think China fine least rest 2021. content keep strict border controls continue vaccine drive rake propaganda win people, let covid continue burn rest world.

Since early year, Việt Nam 53 light earthquakes, 105 hail storms thunderstorms, 11 downpours floods 21 landslides. 
 
Between January-May year, natural disasters claimed 21 lives, injured 29 people, damaged 4,300 houses destroyed 32,000 hectares rice crops. 
 
The economic loss due natural disaster events amounted VNĐ119 billion period.

I really hope booster deployment goes well we're another miserable time winter. Link info? Well, US tell people daily death count, don’t care anything don’t want inconvenience them! Also, restricted areas less vaccine uptake, means hyper-concentrated compared last fall/winter.

Last winter bad whole country vaccinations started, slowly that, mid-December. Seems way yeah Yeah, New Zealand might get control too. Jury’s whether able control future outbreaks. going get vaccinated? vaccine developed work you? LTC facility outbreak started unvaccinated worker. Spread 3 patients 2 vaccinated staff. unvaccinated patient hospice care. two vaccinated residents two vaccinated staff barely symptoms. Can’t wait booster shots. thousands employees. 150 hurt them.

The travel medicine clinic doctor considered taking titer rabies instead, decided they'd give another dose.

The point there's nothing special Covid-19 vaccination except new vaccination schedule settled yet for, say, diphtheria measles.

Only last years decide yellow fever vaccination one done. ended getting two figured out. patients find this? want unvaccinated medical personnel anywhere near I'm sick even getting checkup. dangerous infection risks, trustworthy medical care, imo. think patients able get care people care whether infect patients trust science.

I got ticket Megadeth's upcoming show Quebec City, Canada, Lamb God, october 2nd. 

Thing is, are, like US, 4th wave, Delta variant I'm getting scared catching Covid there. Show almost sold now, be, 5000 people believe, got rules can't 15 000 people shows yet, thank God even 5000, I'm scared.

I bought ticket long time ago show supposed 2020 thought pandemic would october 2021, that's kinda lot people said happen, sadly. 

Maybe they'll reschedule show LOL, would fix problem ask this:

If shoes, would go? managed probably avoid Covid far isolating home since beginning LOL I'm Megadeth diehard fan sure anymore. 

Thank great night! rich Corinthian leather... understand even cross paths, mask wearing common area. tested negative today, taking proper prevention measures. else go, going stay people getting sick. exposed anyone. Last night one showing symptoms, roommates negative time. Vaccinated, one roommate covid months back I. feel prevent spread protecting myself. cant go parents, exposed well place stay common areas believe best bet. sick 3 days test fine fine, covid January, already showing symptoms day 2 exposure surprised sedating patients make easier... admit fear lawsuits.   Enormous majority BLM marchers masked.

Nice selective memory got goin' there. actually worse southern states. Hospitalizations half last time, almost concentrated states. ship patients far away Connecticut get treated. people without covid dying waiting treated room. train wreck.  possible give exemption teeth, ""oh, religious objection vaccines? vaccines refused get life besides one?"" Even then, ought barred certain jobs religion allow safely carry tasks job requires. 

Also, ""sincerely held belief"" exemption people food service industry like wash hands. kind short sighted Cocaine? Wow, misinformation much? Damn..that whole statement lol two countries many restrictions. Far freedom. England's cases WoW though. This. Sure covid zero works isolated country willing strict lockdowns everytime case detected country gets high enough vaccination rate keep icu admission hospitalizations low would prefer locked everytime single case detected. continues majority vaccinated ever stop?  God, people still pushing mask....people dumb.  feel like people really want things return normal, jaded pessimism way things gone, seeming hopeful hopes suddenly dashed again, seems futile hope anymore.  Good. thing actually really scary evaded vaccines better even Delta seems to. 

A recombinant Beta/Delta strain would real nightmare scenario, really good Beta floating around anymore. Well, would always racists anyway, I'd rather vaccinated racist unvaccinated one. Isn’t alien tech one conspiracy theories? know one small group ‘Frontline docs’ pushes version alien DNA. Definitely influences people. 

Reverse psychology dishonest, course one wonders ‘what if’. Limited diagnostics would imagine We've successful vaccine rollout people happy get one life. quick google search gives this: OMG American Dad REAL! :-)  Lol think US bad taking vaccine. Go developing country. one taking here. 

We never beating it. Get vaccinated move on. You’ll happier  Nope.

Fuck sub really fetish lockdowns hard restrictions, it? Christ almighty, people need live lives. v4 we’ll run addresses Covid, soon… law would someone charged inadvertently giving someone virus may may known even had? I'm people Healthcare workers taking vaccine ridiculous take. we're going enforce better start putting tax money towards prisons cause we'll need lock half unvaxxed population. pooling samples testing one individually? That’s thought Vietnam too. Articles CNN saying “How Vietnam managed beat covid” praise international experts…then delta came went Points East weekend checks awful. Anyone could got in. get flu kill someone cause take flu shot also punishable manslaughter? Cmon, pro vaccine without ridiculous opinions Yes, unless don’t get antibiotics progress little spirochete chancre getting gummas, nasty rubbery sores internal organs. Sometimes micro teacher says something right burn forever memory. said today we've got enough coming Pfizer run out. shocks people concerned incredibly deadly plague severe flu?  delta skymiles privileged perspective lacks real understanding world works.

So many people cannot ""stay fuck home 2 weeks"". one down, 2000 go covid cases roof, hospitalisations deaths disproportionately low vast majority population vaccinated. stage, what's point locking down? harm good.

Whether like not, virus stay. can't keep locking forever, sooner later normality must return. dumb Q-stuff, keeps spreading around around around. wow.. price paying death harambe?  isn’t taking age risk getting COVID account. title misleading. Sure will. Everybody going get antibodies eventually. One way yes Regardless people getting immunity one way other. Hospitals filling slightly concerning still near bad peak almost people chose vaccinate. they're gettting antibodies hard way. really see bad thing.  **THANK YOU!!!** 

 
I fully vaccinated (as everybody around me, family, friends, colleagues) – participate festival last weekend required PCR testing prove vaccination. WFH minimal contact people last 1,5 years felt happy, alive!  
 
Hospitalization rates low country 91% among vaccinated – let people risk hospitalization anyway, fully vaccinated even tested, live lives?  
Some people’s jobs depend things going back normal! Government might ""swap"" vaccines countries **request early shipments** Pfizer part plan keep vaccination rollout running possible shortage supply next working hard strategy moment accommodate growth,"" plan announced sometime next week, sources promising everything table.

There still definitive procurement plan stage, fyi. sure that's something praised, really doubt effective swap given NZ's limited supplies. would even work?  pains say, person literally verified nurse /r/prolife worth. 

Especially south, scary amount nurses lower tiered medical staff see managed go proper schooling still reject science. deadline 9/15 far I'm concerned trash taking out. Thank voicing logical opinion digital cameras 2009... slow take lack information get shots.

What information access white people did? education clearly fantastic. Tell logistics entire world leaving homes 2 weeks works. Waiting idiotic answer likely response realize stupid sound. 

No matter situation played end game would changed. eventually, also provided 75m buy vaccines Pacific islands reply arguing government regulation private institutions, *how* mandates implemented something even broached. idea arguing state vs. federal implementation here. position mandates imposed completely federal level irrespective individual area's situations seem think. position is: mandates necessary private industry sufficient incentive act interests human/environmental well-being. aren’t reporters, advertisers. I'm aware. ask person interact though. vaccinated medical professional hesitate tell they're vaccinated. idiots might admit might hide trying play coy saying discuss HIPAA stuff personal stuff whatever, tell need know. Jealous? I'm happy Nzers happy government, I'm also happy live zero covid country. comment needs one top.  said thing last wave, HCA reported highest profit EVER, paying 5K/week every single travel nurse. possible? easy every nurse ratio forced divert funds infinite expansion/buying shit up. 3.3 million doses, 23% fully vaxxed. round 1 million, truth much safer.

It’s negligence avoid voluntary vaccine matter work. one entitled live without risk covid exposure. Whether it’s school, hospital, nursing home anything else aren’t committing reckless endangerment going work without vaccine you’re employer explicitly gave choice get vaccinated not.

The people put family members made choice allow elderly parents stay nursing home doesn’t vaccine mandate. took risk. weren’t promised every employee would vaccinated would never outbreak. took risk. That’s doesn’t make reckless endangerment.  fair, risk small, none existent. people died taking vaccine, number tiny comparison number doses vaccine given number people died COVID. looks people cancer 2 weeks, keeps rest us fed? People posting 99.7% survival rate considering it’s averaged across huge age range.

Age 60-ish you’re looking 2% chance death covid. 70s goes around 8-10%. add diabetes heart disease increase number.

Many people see posting 99.7% figure 0.03% range stretch. Even half percentage chance dying covid it’s good odds. 1 200, something incredibly easy catch. guess people don’t understand risk. now. Many people went Boardmasters 16-29. double vaccinated.

Why would require full vaccination attends maskless 50000 person event beyond me…  could skip argument let be. 
 
Current research suggests natural antibodies catching virus superior vaccine. kids dying catching it. would immoral us jump front countries people dying economies crashing.

Here, areasonable person knows refusing vaccination puts old sick people work closely danger. Yeah, they've announced open next year everyone opportunity fully vaccinated, kind reguardless vaccination numbers. But,i phased re-opening based risk factors countries we're opening too. government announced vaccination target full re-opening announce target hit it, give people enough incentive get vaccinated.

Australia said they'll reopen 70% (although federal government states ignored federal government throughout pandemic), NZs target probably closer 90% I'd imagine hitting 80% early vaccination roll quite promising. also disagree article, PM saying state premiers listening instead continuing policy zero-covid. drink 10 beers Oregon get car drive home hit someone get pulled that's DUI misdemeanor . accidentally hit kill someone felony. difference random chance. There's precedent ""having ways"" 


Don't super stupid things easily kill people willing take increased penalty kill people. image SUVs lining parked front hospital oxygen tanks running car window one disturbing images. think might India. Almost European countries rules place. vaccinate 70% population still can't normalcy, endgame? vaccines getting worse time preventing infections.

But far remain highly effective severe Covid, hospitalization death.

Probably antigens decrease number protective T-cells stays high. would mean infections happen, vaccinated people still immune system capable fighting virus. Scientist say one hundred seconds midnight. surprised 0%. also surprised 398/400. I'm guessing much that. people make rules. real percentage could 2-3x higher since numbers based numbers confirmed positives. Yep, one leaders antivax (and also anti immigration) movement NZ American. gun reforms, drug reforms, euthanasia reforms, US based ""family"" organisations spent fortune campaigning here. clear misunderstanding:
Denmark never vaccine passports. corona passport. required enter e.g. restaurants. could obtain corona passport either by:

- taking free test (valid 72 hours)
- previously COVID
- 14 days first dose

Vaccine mandates briefly discussed quickly shot down. Nobody Denmark would support it. ?!?!? Actually AZ Pfizer effectivity 5 months…

AZ demonised primarily EU politicians due bad blood EU UK. fact politicians even apologies behaviour demonising effectively shut perfectly good vaccine.

Regardless, Australia went anti-AZ set clusterfuck epic proportions dealing with. situation also helped domestically developed vaccine made trial patients test positive HIV despite obviously HIV positive. Add political class absolutely useless… really could make up!  That's different opening reach 80% though. Yeah FDA also approved Viagra made Pfizer

Also Ontario governor could pulled Florida shit people would resisted. sad thing Florida large part population, local government, local institutions, public servants sympathetic GOP stands for. Keep mind restrictions Denmark removing last ones. Since may/June life pretty much completely normal practically mask mandates (except metro Copenhagen) restrictions. fucking terrified getting second Moderna Shot. I'm 19 year old male 110 pounds time got first shot Vaccine-Pro first dose felt like dying 7 days high fever, chills, muscles aches bad nearly walk. couple weeks later started getting depressed pretty bad panic attacks whenever went public always scared fainting, furthmore fucking hate needles. since I've feeling bit better also gained 15 pounds scared get sick week I'll fall hole Australian States power US states seems, closed borders outbreaks occurred stop virus spreading states well, Australian states covid 0 strategy, others ""live it"" strategy, states defied federal government.

The US talks ""states rights"" came US state able states Australia did. Almost like care trying push agenda stupid thing measure. mean every race. Race stupid, actually. [""That's fuckin' unvaccinated need homeschooled. Cases dropping, we've gotten rid city live (Wellington), surprised Delta gone two weeks. Science, hell thing. think people whose entire world view based sky fairy created earth six thousand years ago come understand biology? They've announced 80% people age 30 either first shot booked get first shot next two weeks. Basically, life pretty normal since start summer. restrictions, masks travel restrictions (inside EU). I’ve partying, travelling Spain Germany, seeing friends family - people basically accepted COVID stay everyone wants vaccinated been, people ready go lives. “Trust Sergei want take $1000 equity. Please write down. See 20 years” first half argument checks out. second half much. thing we've seen hotspots usually develop around super-spreader events. entirely reasonable think COVID-19 could circulate months exploding due first super-spreader event. Vaccinating 2% day though. Thanks much taking time watch that! sure takes time lot harder downvoting me.

I struggle Old Testament. I'd encourage discount everything Bible give thought time. Here's explanations around ask believe Jesus? discount along rest Bible? Appropriate picture choice. already degree, many schools offer ""accelerated BSN"" programs designed completed two years. bachelors nursing usually four year degree. become RN associates degree, job opportunities pay much limited. RN BSN programs typically short though, historically good number people got RN, job pay RN BSN bridge programs working.  Contact tracers called yesterday, 8 days post positive result. even bother point? 100% absolutely agree you...However, imagine poor kids getting pulled school crackpot anti vax parents indoctrinated conspiracy theories etc posing homeschool. Seems like we're damned ways. Hopefully said crackpots able stay home brainwash kids leave school. 800 cases day 1 2 deaths day.

We 85% people vaccinated.

Everyone back normal life. Ah, makes sense.

The thing I'm worried mandated younger kids time gets EUA approval. planning wait months VSAFE data getting kids vaccinated. got vaccinated earliest opportunity, 100 million people gotten shot general use 3 4 months. I'm nervous let kids first get age range, requirement, really choice. say ""America"". Many Europeans stupid too. That's true.

It's appropriate public without mask virus control. wait. cares keep wearing mask years? That's better killing people lazy wear mask, pass virus others.

The way write, show interested yourself, others. Maybe chances getting ill slim, still pass virus kill others. Wait. pandemic over. one day though. Understand that. Well that's upsetting. thought US alone bone headedness... waiting england arrive party  [*sarcasm mode ON*] certain half population US take first, second, third shots, frees half billion doses one fell swoop. would thought rural conservatives care much third world countries put health bottom priority list? deeply touched. [*sarcasm mode OFF*] Unvaxxed teacher many kids piled room shortages. crap shoot. single thing post ""low quality"", person replied shit posting. automod bad sub..  We're never going fucking beat thing. variant/strain named spread significantly Yeah. long read need reminded. wish news stations would take approach. alas, get people's attention sell advertising spots. That's do, raising tax revenue helping September. Yeah seems like least people Reuters extremely biased opening Sydney back lol stretched week week wanna let us out. Gonna lot long good luck think experience great cause stuck city fairly progressive time (if little segregated). confirm I’m sick, I’d begging knock out. several major festivals taking place weekend government declared mass gatherings fine

This weekend's festivals far bigger Boardmasters they're spread country Differnt country’s differnt hospitals, staff supplies. Delta+ refers single (relevant) mutants Delta. Delta 2+ would double mutant, etc. still single mutant, still Delta+. guess stupidity political boundaries. think people need raise. “Protection consequences” unique police unions, give real unions bad name. Yeah reaction too. Apparently flu shots would given every six months except influenza seasonal needs yearly.  idea reply got removed ""low quality"" responding calm man, know we're forever, help anything acting like we're going die may true I’d rather drown fluids absolutely unavoidable. imagine FL Gov. DeSantis running Singapore; that'd different tone, devastating result. shut-in though. wear mask around others public, clean hands more, use common sense. pandemic far over. public, even vaxxed, taking care simple things, contributing spread virus. think Europe consider gesture good will. We’re trying protect insanity places like Florida. predicted year ago health care workers would strike would shock sense people.

I dead wrong. Instead, they've given power, allowed abused simply quietly fading away. blame them, huge opportunity lost. events like legal first place? Thousands neanderthalic rabble putting people’s lives stake “get crunk.” probably think people like us value science facts “weird” “creepy” good sources find deaths Pfizer vaccine? taken one dose AZ waiting second September. I'm Australia personally care vaccine take long I'm less protected hospitalisation. see news reports blood clots AZ etc see barely anything Pfizer pop news start digging start seeing things Pfizer deaths rarely media ever talks about. I'm everyone getting vaccinated feel lot Pfizer effects suppressed hard find good information it. since delta variant still vaccine still hold right?  Given book FDA makes J&amp;J done booster trial, probably another J&amp;J shot. Oh please…. Imagine nurses Florida Texas basic state. New South Wales “only” less 1000 7 day avg. Isn’t what’s basically happening Q nutcases, much slower pace ? Yes, is, minority. general consensus Japan seems getting vaxxed super important, keep various measures virus mutating people died despited vaxxed. Better safe sorry. pandemic all. Judging comment, NYT reader. were, would know heavily covering LA work exactly?

Taiwan richer country Czechia, getting donations them?

Sorry simplified view things work verbiage wonky. Basically, new strains variants, variants strains. sense, preventable. even around positive person, staying downstairs house keep away long capitalized  Ontario canada 2/3 population Florida took 57 days accumulate 278 deaths. America, please sake everyone's sanity get shit together.  Travel bans set US completely nonsensical now. Parts Florida shutdowns, curfews, mask mandates, etc. 

And btw, places things 100% compliance either. Wednesday, restaurants county, state's populous, shut -- -- except takeout delivery, county Mayor Carlos Gimenez announced news release. mayor's executive order also close party venues short-term accommodation rentals. Tuesday, revised order allow gyms fitness studios remain open masks required inside, according tweet....  10 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew remain effect everyone essential workers religious obligations...  numbers, ""we saw huge spike"" two weeks opening gyms facilities rolling back restrictions restaurant opening hours end May, Gimenez told CNN. I've living pandemic, live lockdown. locked away anywhere, working home. go much, like huge problem. still see people, still go restaurants, still go shopping, ... balanced. countries done big lockdowns, better countries. adapt small things like using alcohol clean up, washing hands often, wearing mask whenever around others, using plastic barriers cashiers, restaurants, offices, etc. people caught idea quick fix - Lock whole country we'll get ahead game! (No, won't.) Get everybody vaxxed, take easy! (No. Get vaxxed, keep measures virus mutating.)  wonder long generators keep ventilators last power goes out? That's fine, parents always option home school private school kids vaccines. Virtual probably option lot programs. wear mask, follow house/host rules go   Thanks sharing. I’ll see does! Especially considering nothing burger storm like 48 hours ago. So... going remove draconain Covid restrictions? Getting COVID also cause miscarriages preterm birth (which could lead baby dying). much likely COVID would cause vaccine would cause this, contagious Delta much spreading could difficult avoid. best way prevent losing child get vaccine. (I say someone pregnant also got vaccine) Like... go back time un-vaccinate hundreds millions adults already have? use triggering photo convey important decision trigger people frankly already f**cking triggered? /s

Edit: Get shots kids! humans, there’s chemical called Furin used turn certain chemicals required us live. acts like tiny little scissors breaks apart chemicals body use them.

SARS-CoV-2 similar set chemicals furin “knows” cut it’s required enabling Coronavirus enter cells. I’m paint Americans brush, it’s argument people use American police. There’s tons great ones helping people genuinely policing make city better place, ones aren’t ones get talked about.

Maybe get worse gets better, would love see America back balls wall capitalism start putting social programs like education higher priority. problem didn’t come nowhere.  everyone could vaccinated got shots wouldn’t worry it. 

I got shot much me.  need shut trust science.  uses reddit all, r/CoronaBumpers lot great stories pregnant women got vaccinated went successful pregnancy birth healthy child, everyone supportive nonjudgemental. Might helpful resource. ""The contaminants found vials Japan believed metallic particles, ""

Anti-vaxxers: told so! Probably, I'd still wear masks indoors/crowded areas. maybe try get booster soon get back. fun Chi! lived recently. Same. city stalled least 50% vaccinated. Delta done nothing spur vaccination. I'll get third people got first. Id put money 160k+ Sept 1 Dec 31st. get sick get older. understanding, location someone infected GPS tracking data (by cellphone signal), code becomes orange red depending close person person positive vs. secondary contact another positive.

Once code green, need get tested multiple times throughout incubation period. Finishing tests negative results turn code back green. [The EU recommend restricting nonessential travel United States due massive sudden increase coronavirus thought Europe wasn’t monolith? Hungary (no medical bankruptcies), France (no medical bankruptcies), Sweden (no medical bankruptcies) different countries? don’t issue different ruling regards individual national assessments situation?

Oh right, EU. kinda monolithic geopolitical economic entity. Almost forgot that. Yes, variance responses. Every country mentioned massively robust welfare system social safety net United States despite far poorer far smaller. 

And every response better ours. debated (for example, Sweden last year), comparatively massive social safety net exists.

You say learning loss isn’t sustainable another year. think it’s sustainable another decade. CoVID endemic. Go back look posts seven months ago; made argument. rethink refigure American politics serious fashion address new reality. kids get infected CoVID year decade two instances serious, they’ve dropped gifted on-level on-level needing serious support. I’ve parent break crying showed pre post-infection essays daughter. far-sighted enough see isn’t going away insist pretending opening schools in-person without exception, wearing ineffective masks, enforcement policy “safe”. say politics “progressive”…how so? minimized avoided every aspect perspective experience despite asserting better, denigrating mine sole dint lack overseas travel refusal countenance idea sending kids back school viable solution endemic disease. 

I observed decline dozens long CoVID students firsthand, teach AP level. assign twice homework spend part-time job week school tutorials would considered remedial topics two years ago. don’t want kids school declining like without end sight. happen reopen everything like kids can’t collectively decline worse cognitive abilities successive wave virus. CoVID confronted, avoided. we’re going keep schools open, insist, criminal throw doors open leave that. already teachers’ strikes across country 2019 CoVID came onto scene. profession hemorrhaged educators last year, things get worse addressed (which people seem content do). schools must open, hell teachers increased demands workload. 

Teachers increasingly drawing line sand. Schools important…but everything else including college football games, professional football games, bars, Applebees open; safety measures enforced within outside school, vaccinations required, oh way - increase pay despite skyrocketing inflation rents cost living. Nope. Something give. virus continues evolve spread, cost addressing increase. 

You say politics progressive, addressed pressing concerns raised - rising student infection community transmission, teacher attrition, students’ cognitive loss, teacher retention, total absence anything resembling safety net United States lack advocacy said progressives, teacher compensation, millions evictions. skated right past say - correct I’m mischaracterizing response - **a Black teacher supporting immunocompromised family understanding education understanding international politics asserts schools safe support systems must increase unprecedented resurgence severely worse variant.**

What statement, exactly, reflects progressive values? willingness listen perspective minority ground situations adverse own? lack socioeconomic condescension evinced mocking alleged lack passport, punching class? 

I’m curious, enlighten me. Maybe picked something Europe help. Doses going unused thrown away. leap frogging exactly? Nah. I'd rather get booster bit early travel.  you. vaccinated? (asking pregnant vaxxed person)   Yes professional, yes ones wear work apparently due getting COVID patients. really response infection numbesr US though, reciprocity.

The EU allowed non essential US sicne June. US still doesnt allow nonesssential travel EU. EU hoped US chage stance, didnt. Also, main tourism season (important southern Europe particular) over. mandate staff we're it? Unless people lined every CVS Walgreens country waiting get booster shots, nobody ""waiting turn"". Governors fiddling figures highly unfortunate. average, US whole underreported Covid deaths around 10%. deliberate. example: think old people died weeks anyone realised Covid already country.

Whereas time time see idiots difficulty breathing ICU still insisting made right decision taking vaccine! New Zealand currently testing around 0.5% country **per day**, entire country lockdown. China tested approximately 11% country **since initial outbreak**. Testing New Zealand comprehensive. Last time restrictions tight, tightened things turned around. time restrictions tight trend up. Covid zero dead. 2020 really prologue, it? problem would many selfish assholes come even try it. problem along. cases old days nursing teaching could skim lot best educated female population since women many choices terms careers. people want put eith bullshit, much could do. days women options makes harder get blood stone without lot people leaving and/or raise pay drop standards.

beep boop, I'm bot -|:] bot's opinion banned karma manipulation. feel bad, probably bot too.

Confused? Read info work exist. feel like living bad dream: cases still December 2020 levels yet government wants return normal. Sure, vaccination proceeding well, children returning school thus distributing virus families. Cases still really high! So, live we're still level 5 despite level 5 anymore. it’s offshoot original delta strain.

We adding +‘a could started alpha (delta alpha, delta beta).

It’s name convention scheme I’m glad they’re picking different one sub variants variants.  know, likely contributing backfire effect engaging person. identify bad faith, best reward response. arguing literally goal; getting tell they're wrong justification behavior crave. upvoted anyway.  cousin works industry lobbied hard vaccine requirement staff fear lawsuits kept happening California put mandate place. finally gave grounds move forward grateful that. religious exemption research uncovered Christian Science - leadership came said matter faith, rather matter conscience, puts category CA law recognize valid, exemptions religious reasons. Says punctuationless, capital using mf’er  seen whole lot really sick kids. Delta seems mostly (mostly) severe children previous variants. mean they're hospitalized. They're showing sick testing positive. vast majority cases, kids get days. I'm saying kids dying this. they're dying higher rate. nowhere near adult rates still bad enough risk hitting kids vaccine. 

But media fucks us all. 

Ok. run story saying ""Delta Variant Kills Children Previous Variants"". first thing happens article gets fuckton views. Good thing, right? Wrong. people read much past headlines, do. surprisingly, know, antivaxxers actually do. That's kind article zoom obviously sensational invariably holes. find holes. Delta kill children variants, still low number. child death bad. 400 horrible. Next usual causes child death? 400 nothing. people see numbers compared, argument over. Nothing see here. sensationalist media scaring people couch root pennies cushions.

And they're wrong, man. Really. media longstanding well deserved credibility problem. problem specifically they're trying make money. mean, weirdassed alternate universe ""fair impartial"" news channel core demographic? humans core demographic? go specifically one group? People see shit. smart enough articulate it, see trust it. central pillar democracy well informed public. that. media environment comprised almost totally biased corporate media sources idiot assholes Facebook. huge problem. ""happened"" mean became widespread, absolutely yes course. could possibly infect kill people time barely understanding medicine? Illinois. Many media sources deceptive way present headlines, implying US hospitals bursting seams Covid patients simply true many areas. Places high vaccination rates adequate hospital capacity issues. 2-8k USD week eltaday usplay knocked ass. that, Latino race ethnicity. Latino white could Latino black comparison even make sense. I'm aware it, honest encouraging face coverings would helped integrity later. Even novel hard come conclusion cover ones face, Chinese covered immediately, even Chinese scientist stated believed masks would help. name says knew respiratory illness beginning. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2019. saving healthcare workers. intentions might good, honesty would better. 

I agree good CDC willing alter guidelines information virus evolves, deny made big mistake misguiding public beginning, I'm cringing remembering pelosi hanging china town beckoning people come virus spreading. know intentions right also aged poorly. think they've already allowed vaxxed tourists month. get booster shot? going vaccination centers again? Maybe talk pediatrician put off. going tell makes comfortable, may offer information make comfortable one safest vaccines ever made, delta really bad kids.   think long colleges require vaccination mask mandates (as needed) normal-ish college experience Redditors small demographic world's population perhaps overly representative it. Lmao chose picture wish. rich powerful make rules Give break. healthcare workers nothing desperate protection. public scarfed masks would lost many hospital workers, plus they're stupid. would quit. Sorry addiction. I'd still recommend getting muster up; getting sick COVID dying home seem worth avoiding single needle. isn’t price high enough. you’re overwhelmed exhausted you’re scared might kill one patients many, isn’t enough money world Fox that. believe there’s civility clause around here, I’m gonna nice sake. short refutation point flu.

You’re one distributing misinformation. Go play plague inc, knowledge basic - significant mutations actually rare, particularly microscopic life tends reproduce far faster, uncontrolled disease spread leads evolution real time, mean wind arms race germs. lack community unity disciplined cohesive action needs damn booster 8 months right now. Blame jackasses expressing right wear mask dying en masse already overcrowded hospitals, replicating COVID-19 virus quintillion’s times sharing thousands new mutations whole community (though thankfully statistically meaningless mutations). kids fucking love extra tv time though. Sorry, going information obtained Yale. Asians Americans! said New Zealand's respose good enough. 

The article bullshit, tougher measures applied New Zealand alert level lowered (and associated restrictions) tomorrow. 

The lockdown working, despite constant doomsaying. got second shot yesterday (38 weeks) wanted protection hospital delivered. Plus plan give baby toddler breastmilk get antibodies (I heard someone call Moderna milkshake) Well see, first took away books... Much believable ""thing"" killing people alien invasion.  Public school districts can’t require vaccine unless fully approved FDA, worries there. They’re talking mandates older kids adults Pfizer got fully approved. prior EUA, couldn’t mandated yet. Delta Comfort+ Maybe Halloween events reconsidered. Heard immunity means basically everyone either it, vaccine. So, pretty much describes exactly said, statistically get one eventually. comments line back envelope math. Literally saw 20 year old pregnant lady get bedside C-section coding hospital. Baby viable term (26-27 weeks) even sure baby make it. mom makes it, likely ever state able care anyone, let alone herself. 

Whole family vaccinated. Like, don’t even feel bad…

That and, maybe child better he/she doesn’t make cause they’re gonna health issues rest life without mom first place. lot Nope-ing going altogether. submission linking yahoo.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I'm saying hurt China, calling nearly 4% national debt would fuck us hard. always sell shit elsewhere. pretty China, massive economic restrictions result covid would enough reason hurt us.

Yeah, could ""live sustainably"" even patchouli smelling hippie crap actually involved sort plan ""Just buy one TV, maaan."". really anything. pivoting India would horrific every level.

Their economy also highly dependent cheap crap factory world. USA good buying cheap crap. But, I’d tomorrow United States buy less cheap crap, reduce waste, focus self-sufficiency…or even pivot India, SE Asia, Mexico, etc. China…I would argue would negatively impact China much would USA. means February / March potentially 2-5 age groups, waiting one group done starting testing next one? getting stuff? someone say almost exact thing recently said would get it’s fully approved. said “It’s actually fully approved EUA extended.

Exactly! dad GED highest level education, enough common sense get fully vaccinated COVID-19(granted, he's much smarter education level would think). conceived within week second dose. antivaxxers, practicing best practices education? Sounds like there's already lot unqualified people teaching... also putting kids coworkers risk. Requiring vaccines lowering requirements short term, would least alleviate one issues. Sedation people respiratory problems unless incubated. sedated unable breathing exercises, flip body every hour two, etc. kill hundred thirty thousand Brits it? Excess mortality rates.  mom nurse, graduated Miami University(Ohio) nursing, smart, doctors tell smart areas. 

Granted, fully vaccinated, I'm using anecdotal example. Lambdadelta want 100% mask wearing go out, grocery &amp; dept. store shopping high income area. Much higher mask compliance.

This true Midwest Region. Midwest, actually see higher usage masks lower-income areas, thanks political divide inner-city urban areas, upper-middle class suburban areas. thought process frightening. Im going guess friends. Imagine thinking know what’s best people’s children... So, month now? feel bad college students COVID era

College already expensive enough - able normal college experience extra bummer can't afford doctor? confirm. Currently live Southern Oregon.

It's literally insane. wife bought us tickets concert (when things started get better, Delta took over). told either eat ticket cost, show rapid test positive, get refund... stupid. mentality Question community : vaccinated (J&amp;J) since April - tested positive coronavirus 08/11/2021. Isolated 14 days back work. get infected soon after? data many kids kinds Covid-induced complications?  rate vaccine opposition high among nurses?

It's really high one would think. loud minority. According American Nurses Association, 83 percent nurses fully vaccinated COVID-19 May, 2021(so number risen since Science would tell something effective one person may effective another.  doctors for.

Im mostly trying avoid lingering symptoms smell taste loss long covid symptoms without much info whether avoidable current two doses say 7 months feels like grabbing dose 5 6 avoiding infection altogether safest bet even I’m remotely considered high risk  Lol typical poster here, uninformed yet confident.

Delete posts I’ll consider issue closed. Even giant, sweat filled dance parties vaccines masks would still far extinction due COVID-19. 

A lot would die, death rate still like 1-2% worst average.  *laughs sars-cov-2* idea chose photo dude Thank information. cops died covid [all causes refusing vaccine wearing bullet-proof vest moronic.  people pissing outdoors football games?  That's fine argument ignore facts. mandate vaccines schools require vaccines almost every activity. Delusions reasons. There's inclusive, there's try-hard.

""Birthing people""... come on.  daughter-in-law recently quit job charge nurse. I'm honestly happy her. take time take care young kids. exhausted. bunch downvotes another comment mine another subreddit saying messaging pandemic terrible. person ER mad people thought get virus need wear mask they'd vaccinated. Huh, get message? 

I agree this. trusted state federal government would care health emergency. weighed politics, shortages optics EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. mattered charge, sucked.   Delta variant Yes average person restaurant vulnerable somebody long-term care facility. Plus they're choosing go eat vs trying live everyday life Due Hurricane Ida.

Another hospital lost roof supposedly  damn really took four hours come response huh? grew physically abusive household constantly felt like life could ended irrational emotions people around me. 

The reasons pandemic easier childhood firstly, growing up, could tell ONE. like fighting war one walls house could see. Yes, 50% country may believe thing regards virus, that's still 50% humans believing reality. still talk feelings lots people. That's HUGE! 

**Step 1: thankful friends have. Cultivate friendships friends, get some.**

Secondly, ability drive car now. child stuck house time can't leave. Yeah, covid lockdown, it, could still go walk ask anyone permission back certain time. swear, able ride bike sit favorite tree daydream kept alive high school.

**Step 2: Get connected nature.**

Thirdly, found late teens diagnosed mental illness (go figure) got help. would absolutely made without care trained professional. took time find right person. could go back time give advice, would wait. Get help now. lot therapist offices booking least month right shortage mental health professionals getting worse. Set date. first session even going helping much giving history, family basics, health basics, etc. likely take several sessions progress starts made. make damn appointment. always cancel, wait panic attacks daily suicidal hospital can't wait four weeks point.

**Step 3: Seek professional help.**

Once get therapist, actually tell do. throwing money away. give ""homework,"" whether that's journaling, activity, whatever, owe give try. Even work, say tried adjust suggestion accordingly.

**Step 4: Learn coping skills therapist says.**

Just throwing there, growing up, assumed, ""Ok, life like this. I'm constant threat I'm gonna survive."" later learned life could way. fact we're survival mode ok feels normal. **No one ever promised life without pandemic.** worry it? We're here. best is

**Step 5: Practice acceptance**

and 

**Step 6: grateful have**

Anxiety ""what if"" disease. something that's actually occurring right now. ""How gonna feel \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ happens."" deal anxiety, accept feel awful present moment. ""Ok, world fucking sucks pandemic. sucks people dying. sucks people deny sucks, sucks, sucks feel sad/miserable/hopeless etc. makes feel worse saying, ""I feel sad/miserable/hopeless *I shouldn't* feel way never way world never way. ""should"" yourself. helpful. ok feel bad. feel bad feeling bad. natural do, brain trying get state feeling bad, situation, brain's ""get outta here"" program gonna cut running bear. pandemic characterizes entire world. can't escape. 

Accept can't escape. make goal escaping. Make goal riding environment changes. That's do, wait wait wait 18. People upset feel like lost two years life. I'm like two years?! wish life risk two years child. woulda awesome. stronger think. kid deal life threatening stuff zero power affect outcome, totally got this. promise you.

And back gratitude, find anywhere can. imagine living black plague indoor plumbing? Next time flush toilet say ""Thank you. G-d! I'm happy deal shit.""

Working 80+ hour weeks taxing immune system overworked nurses et al need help get. Simple answer. virus continues spread like people letting do, yes, cases. longer virus exists, mutates. every mutation, vaccines less effective. Look less effective vaccines Delta Lambda, example. believe workers required vaccinated October 18 mandates issued Oregon's governor, Kate Brown ([you read mandates cover workers volunteers Oregon's schools healthcare settings, understand correctly (barring exemptions medical reasons ""sincerely-held religious beliefs""). heads-up recently popularized pre-print study Israel compared efficacies vaccine-induced immunity 'natura' (aka convalescent) pre-print study getting lot attention lately spite many flaws misrepresentations.

&amp;#x200B;

# Misrepresentations

You two coupons, one 98%-off, one 96%-off.

You use first coupon purchase $1 candy-bar (tax free, Girl Scout)... purchase costs 2 cents.

You use second coupon purchase $1 candy-bar (tax free, Girl Scout)... purchase costs 4 cents.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

After applying coupon, see second candy bar cost twice much first (4 cents compared 2 cents)... buuuuut... factor two describes relative savings two coupons.

To see much better 98% coupon compared 96% coupon, do: 
(98%-96%)/96% 
and would find first coupon was, unsurprisingly, little 2% better second... so... factor two, factor 1.02.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This study acting like 98% coupon twice good 96% coupon.

This study sees 191 symptomatic infections among vaxxed, 8 symptomatic infections among unvaxxed who'd previously infected covid... divide 191 8 determine previous infection 27 times better avoiding symptomatic infection... comparing post-coupon prices.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

To make fair comparison, we'd need know many symptomatic infections would've among people who'd gotten infected first time without vaccine.

The CDC currently estimating 85% infections symptomatic, so, that's starting 'price' candy-bar.

After using previous infection coupon, 0.05% infections symptomatic... savings 84.95%.

After using vaccine coupon, 1.18% infections symptomatic... savings 83.82%.

We compare savings:

(84.95%-83.82%)/83.82% = 1.3%

Immunity previous infections seen 1.3% effective vaccine.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# Flaws

47% vaccinated group comorbidities vs 39% group.

There hundreds people vaccinated group cancer, hundreds diabetes, hundreds immunocompromised. literally twice many people cancer vaxxed group group; 2.5 times many people vaxxed group immunocompromised.

The vaxxed group 1,303 people suffered comorbidities, yet ended 7 hospitalizations, 183 symptomatic cases.

The vaxxed group 20% people comorbidities group... so... situation worse, outcomes little worse.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

... another thing is... 16,214 people previously infected group ones survived group 16,249 people 35 died, 158 hospitalized, 13,782 experienced symptomatic infections... good trade (what even) 1.3% better outcomes second time first-time outcomes vaccinated. tracked, really need sensationalised articles it. cases low atm UK (relatively speaking considering dropped almost restrictions life back normal), suspect mostly due asymptomatic cases vaccinated individuals. know hell lot people getting covid right ever personally knew whole pandemic, basically wiping entire unvaxxed population. Case numbers useless becuase dont take account people getting infected bothering take test asymptomatic.  


I've started paying attention mostly deaths atm. hospitalisations important too, get bette gist things changing based deaths feel. That's great irrelevant here.  believe required October 18 mandates issued Oregon's governor, Kate Brown ([you read mandates cover workers volunteers Oregon's schools healthcare settings, understand correctly (barring exemptions medical reasons ""sincerely-held religious beliefs""). religion starts ends barn. almost poetic.   Think this, lose 1/40 Afghan span 20 years.

""There'll deaths, devastations, community same, least free"" - guest celebrity reporter maybe It’s sad people using freak occurrence fuel agenda.. Striclty speaking, can't pick gender certain age state ""getting vaccine better"" ""not getting vaccein better"". missing variables need maths. 

Let's take entirely hypothetical example: let's assume one second live tiny island zero Covid cases zero contact outside world. Then, default, taking vaccine always risky risks complications Covid infection.

So risk-benefit-analysis vaccine changes likelihood getting infected Covid. means result analysis might mean getting Astrazeneca risky 35-year-old county A, highly recommended 35-year-old country B.

But many countries today, Delta variant led situation everyone living one day catch virus, according many scientists. say pretty much question ""when"", ""if"". case country, (almost) back situation looking age gender. little agree guy talking to, that’s terrible argument. vaccines goddamnit. X mean X B.  reports Israel seem imply anti-bodies fade around 5-6 month mark second shot. December anti-bodies lower winter worst season respiratory disease Northeast. 

I work swim official winter. would much prefer boosted season starts. also bear some, individual also bear some.  Least they’re trying though. mean look conspiracies they’re messaged. They’re better people believe it. longer COVID crisis people without facemasks see public transport. kind people refuse vaccines, lockdowns things.

I’m seriously fucking tired conspiracies. Everyone keeps believing conspiracies debunked again, yet continue. learned basic knowledge viruses work high school earlier, it’s like Covid started, everyone threw knowledge window.

-Fauci said it’d take two weeks stop spread. People bring time. said assumption everyone would they’re supposed to. hardly anyone did, takes hundred times longer. People don’t seem understand this.

-Masks work. specific. fucking bandana face really isn’t going shit compared something like N95 example. everyone wears bandanas good luck trying stop spread.

-The vaccine isn’t deadly. Yes, people died it, minute number. usually, companies behind vaccines looking deaths. It’s due people’s bodies handle it, vaccine itself. even companies trying figure reduce chances regardless. people act like kills millions millions people bizarre reason. Hell, even Tucker Carlson Fox told story guy took vaccine died 24 hours later. didn’t bring guy hit truck.

-The reason there’s breakthrough cases every time virus mutates, vaccines become less effective. Thanks everyone letting spread, we’ve got several variants vaccines don’t work against. people act like vaccines intentionally don’t anything begin with, make us take booster shots future.

-People didn’t want take Pfizer’s vaccine wasn’t FDA approved. Well guess what, it’s FDA approved now. people taking it? Nope, they’ve decided can’t trust FDA. They’re going continue building judgement every time something like happens.

Pull head bit. Anyone else feel utterly helpless vaccinated country world broken covid records despite vaccinations? Yeah, thought process well. don’t think lab leak == human made.

I saw news report China 2018, investigating bat viruses. natural virus, leaked lab research it. see think unvaccinated teachers room kids. That's dangerous everyone. That's important good teacher and, again, unvaccinated shit teachers. ask police unions much effective.

Because police unions united, willing take action protect members, regardless cost. Take something like teachers instance. majority teachers willing abandon students go strike higher pay? teacher unions try minimize disruption students' education? 

Imagine teachers willing join unions, teacher unions focused protecting interest members, instead worrying children's education. effective think teacher unions be?  Yes, early winter seems far away school started. going help?! son’s school already 25 cases since school started. assume he's exposure Thursday? work going pissed. guess results come back negative sooner, get sooner test. Mate, clearly interested facts, doomsaying. lockdowns measures working, despite comments suggesting can't won't. 

Comments like past point containment, NZ looks heading way too.

are bullshit. Containment **is** working New Zealand. give time way early flu shot. immunity waning spring wave (usually worse fall one) still full swing. official booster program supposed start September, announced. sounds like CDC others getting organized recommend etc. way get third shot currently tell pretend first second shot. indication bit early. Yes want protected two shots lot protection already. Oh, fucking bullshit

My response civil, anything original one responding was. Again, using special needs insult really fucked up. response right removed, break rules. never said that. also think happened, OP. know people unpleasant side effects (myself included,) I’ve never heard lasting couple days. Call doctor explain happened get advice. It’s entirely possible contracted covid went vaccine. Contact Associated Press, request anonymous. take protection sources EXTREMELY seriously. They’ll also continue research story, confirming medical staff. McDonald's drive since march 2020 Confiscate bullet proof vests. need someone shoots them. Language barrier. don’t speak English isn’t sufficient postings Spanish make difficult. 

Also, misinformation. Lots Latino anti vaxxers saying get shot you’re undocumented ask ID detain don’t it. work Latino community many people believe this. convince many parents get shot local school trusted teachers principal. mean would hope I've seen Ford plan b vaccines fail. We're opening schools soon full capacity stadiums vaccine passports seem interested shutdowns yet anyway. anyone know progress vaccination trials &lt;12yo's? 1. Vaccinated people less likely catch it. catch yes, viral load similar. 
2. 2. Hospitalization rates much lower among vaccinated people – it’s dangerous disease A
3. Need give incentive people get vaccinated. everybody gets treated way eventually lockdown everybody what’s point even getting vaccine? guess incorrect report saying.

The risk dying Covid approximately doubles every 7 years age. someone 70 32x likely die catch covid.

Meanwhile vaccine reduces chance death 95% 1 20. However, offset 32x increase age. vaccinated 70 year old still likely die unvaccinated 35 year old.

You could twist around say getting vaccinated increases chance dying correct. vaccine still reduces chance death 95%+ despite facts.

It’s also home looooots prepper types anti-government weirdos. much dense forest rural land, folks come away people, types vaccine hesitant. Unsurprisingly, also lot serial killers there.

Like, wtf students telling need class graduate.  need cardio burger, chonky boi. Oklahoma, fast food places still closed indoor seating limited capacity. hope trend continues. Yeah, too. RSV also dangerous own: common cause pneumonia children. Also, consider half school districts reporting. much 4k. won’t. economic impact great. Keeping kids home remote schooling keeps large amount women workforce. Shutdowns killed sectors economy. 

The feds care money health. Taco Bell switched mobile ordering only. Can’t even order window. Also, Taco Bell app doesn’t take Debit Card VISAs, actual Credit Card VISAs, obviously cash, literally can’t even order anymore. checking Debit card. Nah free loaders need get go make burgers injecting every day? agree. think big part problem lies corporate level. charge franchises much overhead, franchise little pay workers. parent (corporation) needs payroll employees. Much US (probably US, population) limited closed indoor dining last year last winter.

The existence highly effective vaccine complicates things comes reimposing restrictions. Many us shutting things protect refuse protect themselves. age groups eligible vaccines (12 older), vaccines required for: indoor dining (including bars); gyms, theatres, shared indoor spaces expected occupancy 30 minutes more; office complexes expected occupancy 10 persons; hospital staff outpatient medical facility staff; school staff (elementary, secondary, college) students 12 years older; passengers public transit exceeding 30 minutes (flights, trains, distance buses). Masks required vaccinated unvaccinated people indoor shopping. Masks required unvaccinated students (under 12) unless furnished proof vaccination members household.

This political agenda. It’s damn common sense mitigation strategies. LOL no.

I work (non-bedside still inpatient) department.

Between surges just... stopped talking shortstaffed cheery ""meetings"" discuss ""best utilize existing staff"" ""we're getting FTEs"". We're bleeding employees. Multiple quit orientation; one person left midday.

I got called name attending in-person meeting July; coworker told one masked (we vaccinated, damn hospital, why). month's meeting? seriously dystopian shit, VIRTUAL (surprise surprise, I'm waiting apology), touting new nearby facilities vent capabilities expanded capacity... they're ""not yet"" trained peds. word ""COVID"" mentioned. point many deaths could prevented weren’t. estimate much 40% 

Can say plague? Wait, keeping average people physical mental stress exceptional levels rivaling people war zones daily deaths around 18 months straight eventually takes toll them? Where's Stunned Pikachu face pic, must somewhere folder?! ... 

(Next thing tell me, they're also payed treated like ****, would real bummer ....) true count deaths start year vaccine rates low. need to. Delta going rampant fuck. many people work caught incuding me. Back day, Oregon racist, didn’t even allow Black people slaves. couldn’t enter state. Better 7.25 pee hour.

I love wisconsin Sounds like school district hired bad teachers unprepared got hard quit. kid's school dropped ball. point is, chose half measure gone way. Hey... fast food places go permanent drive curbside only. 

I sure would thought made business sense, guessing actually run numbers figured indoor dining generally (not right now) increases profits. doesn’t prevent spread much promised.

source promise? We’re San Francisco work require showing proof vaccination ID indoor seating restaurants. bit late, yes? Delta already rampant EU anyway. Well, girl refused fully mask up, laugh saying, “it’s blessing disguise.” Quite maskhole, is. Fast food places U.S. close indoor seating good, focus drive-thru curbside operations. mine, ever since COVID started. might reopened briefly, might thinking different restaurant. Either way, indoor dining definitely least closed time, still is.

Not sure one-off thing, recent article building new design. Seems drive-through  Offers? It’s mandatory considered vaccinated, right? Outside reddit, people enjoy meal seated w friend, loved one lover. Surprising news, many cases! world I'm inject kids vaccines gone testing relevant peer group. Liability also issue. everyone else get vaccinated (in US least). Everything bigger Texas- MuRiCa! Around 25,000 people died flu 2018 UK, bad flu year. 

But here's thing... flu accumulating deaths week 40 week 15 

The UK surpassed bad flu's annual death rate, summer students school! always able.to wear mask... change except often people free way?

If wanted leave, would cost huge amount time, effort, job, importantly safety nets life - house burned today, would sleeping brother's in-laws house. available I've got easily dozen friends would take family least short-term.

I would giving up, *on top of* social cost - would longer around friends. basically thinks vaccines rushed 5-10 years millions people going regretting decision get vaccinated due presently unknown long-term side effect X.

On own, think that's *insane* position. avoid one first people update iPhone, body stake think caution good default position. point, there's 5 billion+ doses administered altogether.

But position combined fairly intense media push get people vaccinated turned incredibly angry spiteful ready fight drop hat anything covid related. pushing away anyone encourages get vaccine, pissed mask mandates, sort turned ""that person"", issue.

It's really sad watch person greatly respect go direction. sounds like guy hears Hurricane Ida, storm still gulf, bother boarding windows evacuating. media would castrated medical staff ""abandoning posts"" paid hospital admin themselves. guarantee see SHARP criticism blaming hospital workers striked better working conditions pandemic.

Hell, look recent NYT article chose interview admins burnout staff rather bedside staff themselves. people think goodie bags cold pizza enough, clapping VP zoom.

2 admins came floor day ""check us out"". stayed literally 2 minutes walking around unit clapping saying shit like ""we told bad wanted see guys pulled together see through!"". think even started trying humans (?)....  sounds terrible. strange thing non-assinine reasons vaccine hesitant (magnetization likes included) apply way more-so actual virus. I'd rather take chances vaccine developed tested openly international effort virus lets face it, probably leaked CCP lab. Yup, “two weeks” “two weeks”… Macdonald's walk window win rest lives. Like flu. I’m double vaxxed. care spreading covid unvaccinated people? made choice stupid. get die that’s good don’t care protecting wearing mask.

It’s highly, highly, highly, unlikely I’m killing vaccinated people wearing mask. True, think want check phone. Ideally, want place order app swing pick up.  local McDonald's already moved drive to-go couple weeks ago.

They dine-in open like week, lol. “gifting” article become thing? That’s hilarious, really think “journalism” gold something?  really think virus go away harsher measures continue spread come back soon lifted? paying low thing. Considering, much take days people order ever, think efforts workers feed customers pay food, way cover workers. possibility introducing pro-Russia anti-anti-Russia bias and/or propaganda content. 
 
Now tell that's meaningless impossible  condition refugee status.  x1000

Innocent people dying things Drs never lost patients lack ICU staff/beds

Roll willfully unvaxxed fucking street.

Let's tar n feather em we're it. need bring shame back tenfold. 8.5 pee breaks per hour pretty much impossible US effectively lock ""just time"" global supply chain. reserves. need national vaccine compliance moratorium non critical social gatherings. vaccine thing hope enforcing since many brainwashed. Vaccine least action effect tool have. never opened up.  Aha! gotcha! Critical hit!

No, dummy, totally possible would worked way better absolutely botched response have. surgeon kill people even sober. still negligence perform surgery drunk kill someone. 

The key ""reasonableness "", reasonable person working bunch old sick people pandemic would get vaccinated. local McDonald’s $15.00 p/h starting still major staffing shortages Taco Bell near work (Myrtle Beach, SC) signs everywhere looking help $12-15 wages. It’s since last year sadly they’ve drive thru open. Considering? already done. Glad live state takes virus serious. restrictions anything vaccinated? Again: reasoning requiring unvaccinated test simply work Delta. makes whole approach somewhat arbitrary, probably enough survive legal challenge foreseeably backed quite money. Given that, go way make vaccination mandatory? basically legal hell, much better outcome successful. 

Anyway, testing still go away entirely. simply many can't get vaccinated medical reasons whose immune system compromised vaccine fully effective. Uncomfortable is, point question becomes: many willing sacrifice reasons convenience money? We'd end exactly place anti-vaxxers ethically. one keep patient alive you, leave, may letting person die. Expect insane 5G connectivity there. know two people (my husband’s brother wife) gotten it, don’t know anyone go hospital. Hasn’t changed fact cautious be, though. Los Angeles, numbers usually $2k+ mask mandates everything aren’t thing anymore. think state california gave You’re shit creek sure. either start paddling hopefully fix rest teachers quit, complain bitterly internet nothing. proving point situation answer. wanted see admit lol.

I think probably touch grass without happening. There’s prudent normal, there’s reckless normal. reckless. U.K. restrictions lifted ~1.5mo.

The thing - everything could protect daughter one rare kids gets really sick, would never able forgive myself. addition this, delta variant seems hitting kids harder alpha, data say whether statistically meaningful yet. That's lottery sane parent wants willingly put child in.

It's strawman, relevant discussion. Everything *can* done. people say *can't* done mean can't done circumstance ever physically impossible. mean can't done without worse alternative, essentially. I've wondered Zombie Apocalypse overload entertainment media represented Zeitgeist. know - collective subconscious percolating covid think may onto something.

2. Breakthrough infections milder clear faster, contagious period much shorter (10 days vs 20 days) less chance spreading it.

Claiming vaccinated people dangerous unvaccininated people straight lie. Nonetheless, it’s still unclear believe one variant interest shares ~~some~~ ***at least 14 mutations*** *with variants concern* “completely different title misled believe.” 

Please source/substantiate reasoning it’s nbd, especially since believe contradicts OP reporting [and definitions we’re [developing combining multiple problematic sorta definition immunity escape develops IRL. watched happen real-time Alpha Delta.

Mutations happen literally time don’t hear overwhelming majority don’t develop mutations significance. 

[This variant isn’t definitely worthy keeping eye on, OP link emphasizes. could be. also could importing cases country largely infected C.1.2, spread ""superspreader events"" result particular ordinary outbreak overrepresented sequencing data. 

It's important note 2% referring 100 total cases.  
It absolutely could variant outcompeting Delta, level detection also fluke.

No one knows answer today though. Clearly, medical workers would still go work. Clearly would vaccinated using PPE whatever protocols required keep risk profile low possible. Clearly trucks would still run. (trucks never issue) Children 12 negligible risk covid. mean ffs UK isn’t vaccinating minors low risk risk universal vaccination among minors doesn’t outweigh risk covid. *KAAAAAAAHN!* Didn’t reverse happen last year NSW able contain Vic suffered? Native Americans highest. Privacy. good $3.50 pretty much heard people refer Comirnaty trying argue brand new pushed approval process dubious reasons say dumb name. See, hourly wage franchisee, corporate. Maine state income tax, may go levels. Florida (at time) state income tax. People burned out, want better life. Money part makes better life.  200,000 new cases per day, would take 4.5 years entire population United States (just 331,000,000) infected. That's worst case scenario without restrictive measures (masking, vaccination, etc.), without enough people involved measures, still large enough at-risk population plenty hosts there, mention reinfection possibility.

We really need take action similar way eradicated smallpox (isolation vaccination geographical location), much resistance action.  usually badly enough require hospitalization like first infection. OP right, eventually antibodies entire population hospitalizations start decrease threshold. Right? Like, arent ever going get 80 90 percent vax tbe us seems. doable, countries it. barrage negative headlines starting wear users down, think. good news, like recent [increase sort gets buried. Oof, sounds like Upstate New York. north go, South get. Love home *bad* places. US reasonable instead placing hopes vaccine throwing measures… Arenas full fans, concerts full capacity. Proof vaccination best way forward. 

Is San Fransisco NYC mandated vaccines far cities? yet, he's probably already weighed pros cons come side beneficial not.  


IMO, novel virus, impossible wait science get ahead virus. wait science follow, we'll behind again. daughter vaxxed, hit 12. Yes, risk, weighed long term effects even 1% chance serious effects, worth it.  Get tested. Recommend nephew get tested well.

According worldmeters 125 serious critical covid patients Australia right now. country 25 million people struggle patients? simply true. Yep. write last time downvoted. people: scientist still sequencing viruses (especially gb great job that). means isn’t uncommon new variants new mutations discovered.

People Britain care long hit anyone close them. realise  fast food joints indoor seating open live. closed (drive only) since April 2020. assure kids fine, without vaccine. need listen me... Look every available information COVID-19 infections within 0 - 18 age group. Yeah cus everyone looks government website they.

It mentioned papers months actually deduce risk age groups tables provided BMJ study itself.

Specifically looking table 2, see age-group distribution thrombosis incidents heavily skewed age group 3 study groups (AZ vaccine, Pfizer vaccine, getting COVID). Given overall risk greater COVID patients, per age group draw conclusions. Yup.

Chick-fil-A near did. question many casualties willing sustain. Let’s forget virus doesn’t want deadly wants spread much possible. 
It might sound stupid consider plague inc. make virus fast deadly, hosts die way pathogen transmitted. went 83 53? guess, sort of, vaccine passport, me, passport vaccinated. danish Corona passport obtained without vaccination. entirely Denmark, they've also got ridiculously good testing infrastructure far highest tests per capita country world  unfortunately likely things actually work. Take look recent papers vaccine efficacy waning. Non vaccines even close fully effective, especially delta variant, best unclear level length protection granted prior concerning still near bad peak 

This summer, many people still social distancing, partial effectiveness vaccine, becuase average age unvaccinated people much lower vaccinated people. Recall happened last summer. Absecent massive lockdown going winter much, much, higher case load. additional protection vaccine likely offset large degree massively higher number cases occur looking likely see enormous disruption healthcare systems large numbers excess deaths winter. Chance eventually getting covid close 100% get vaccine. Even NZ, they've said gradually end restrictions vaccination rate reaches 80%. terrible majority students full burnout now. blame anyone took gap year everyone afford that. Nope, we're using Pfizer anyone 40 Let clear.

 us, adults get vaccinated. carry burden. failure so, vaccinate children, least impact COVID can't even consent.

Shame vaccinate doesn't. 

And trying protect unvaccinated public shaming legal liability, shame too. Without you, happening. again, would fill positions? believe anyone street going make parents happy. world wars local district class sizes go twenty. non certified teacher classroom? worse, cramming two classes room. imagine hell would bring.

Right right circumstances we’re going dealing good long while. 53 cases today. article day behind. described vaccine passport extra allowances? UK festivals started back early June. Since then, cases deaths pretty much plateaud.

Cases started rising recently seems return schools Scotland. 

All evidence shows predominantly outdoor gatherings, like festivals, relatively safe. Hundreds festivals happened last weeks major issues all.

In case Boardmasters, younger demographic festivals, attendees probably unvaccinated single jabbed.

I went festival back July. felt safe I'd go back immediately given choice.  teach Texas ICUs capacity. started students wear masks. students complied except son conservative. coughs time, doesn’t cover mouth, wipes nose hand. teach 8th graders. Agreed. don’t work States don’t deal anti-masking, anti-vaccine COVID deniers, still hate job become. shit pre-COVID, it’s shit right now, likely get shittier COVID.

Here’s problem: patients acutely ill ever before, they’re getting older, opioid epidemic control, staffing adjusted reflect changing patient landscape. old ratio 4:1 doesn’t work anymore. hospitals want retain floor nursing staff, need implement manageable ratios hire support staff. crucial, especially boomers hit 65 older age bracket.  Never thought I'd asking are. need advice testing.

Wondering big-box stores that?  local mcdonalds already closed dining room went drive-thru back march----**of 2020**. first initial surge, nobody wants work crappy shifts crappy pay non-existent health care. still booming business (by labor metrics), still jacking prices anyway like end near (they want *their cut* *your covid cash*).. still paying shit wages, offering non-existent health care benefits...  bk riding boat, business tanked hard. struggle bring enough workers able open drive-through limited operating hours (they open early late pm anymore).  Remember lot us excited months back watching subreddit wither away nothing near future?

Bummer, dude. Studies show received good protection previous infection, antibody counts almost certainly waning eight months later becoming vulnerable again. single dose booster mRNA vaccine would helpful keep immunity that's revised since guidance came out. cases, even people history severe allergic reactions take it, precautionary measures  find hard believe live somewhere zero teenagers work, havent years.    fact someone spend 2020 working secure vaccine verification app nuts me. much time test relatively simple idea. Got it, still really effective much previously though. Damn antivaxxers gotta ruin everyone even anti maskers want around anti maskers? general advice take vaccine currently sick.

What's more, FDA approved COVID vaccines people age 12 due concern possible health reasons - may exist, studies still underway.

Also, there're people who're unfortunately allergic components approved vaccines; sometimes allergies severe enough take it. But, talk doctors.

There're also people fragile health immune response vaccine could put lives risk. Unfortunately, case, avoiding vaccine getting COVID could also put lives risk - advice would talk things doctors.

But fall one categories, know it. Otherwise, I'm aware group people counseled avoid vaccine health reasons. Go ahead get it.  local TB McD kiosks lobby. greatly prefer it. sit mix match swap customize much want order perfect every time. Well, input correctly. 

I think I’m outlier fast food. always dine in. Pre-Covid course. Fast food short life span want best version.

The way things go back 97% normal vaccine passports. You’ll create safer indoor spaces, reduce transmission risk, significantly reduce strain healthcare likely get many people fucking get vaccinated.

Biden make federally regulated things like, say air travel, require vaccines. Chile opened indoor dining first time since 2020 require proof vaccination well  I'm Missouri, idea anything like I'll look. skipping vaccine knowingly interacting others without masks, unintentional.

Again, criminals often get away things. mean ok. even close.

We governors maiming killing children brought charges, still allowed leaders. Actually vaccinations aren’t single best way get this. wish was. frankly I’m sorta pissed pitched such. key tool toolbox yes. isn’t tool. 

And ca tool especially % folks world wide refuse vaccinations ever reason. Take upvote! comforting know students share opinion. folks autoimmune system issues, risky. body reacts poorly vaccines overreacts, risky. yes doctors recommend folks take based personal medical history. herd immunity, people would protected too! Germany, share population fully vaccinated ~2.6% EU average ~8% percent US. Also France, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland. yes, selection ""EU countries west Germany's western border"" technically correct. Okay, “low wage” jobs Orlando thing. Im talking anything $8.65 minimum, lower 10. should’ve specified clump job pays “9.50/hour” “minimum wage jobs central Florida”. It’s life poverty line, without doubt. “Let’s go dig spa ash flu that’s good idea” wtf  guess ever interact anyone else kids immunocompromised family members, right?

I made minimum wage once.  16 got two part time summer jobs, one minimum wage one 75 cents higher. school started quit min wage job.

Very Americans minimum wage jobs. rare. 2% hourly employees count employees 1%. I'm sure many close better way look number Americans poverty line around 9%. Alternatively there's data support close 50% Americans low paying jobs much better thing minimum wage job. county florida 800 cases per 100K, ain't nothing closed either 🤦‍♂️ think studies pretty short definition “long.” I’ve seen least one defining “long Covid” still fatigue 21 days. I’d call “normal.” 

There people actual tissue damage, still symptoms six months later. That’s kind long term interested in. worn three weeks later post viral fatigue. Counting likely skewing numbers, causing undue fear. I'm praying mayhem. could Delta, too, lower rates. 

The reality accept there’s never going scenario COVID fully stops. It’s dealing moving forward. says many, all. Try reading next time   No. cannot take away parents right like that.  Imagine getting cold. I'm annoyed give cold. everyone either vaccinated gotten sick it, actual disease burden pretty low. problem right now, full 1/3 people either vaccinated gotten it. 

Now Hawaii plight. Lets say numbers absolutely surge. Places like Florida end sending patients say South Carolina treatment ""full"". Hawaii send Covid patients? HK nurses doctors got fucked indeed suffered PTSD firsr SARS outbreak 2003. Seeing lot people die colleagues get infected that. 

Take care. Iceland Denmark death (which awesome) Fast food places area paying $12+ still hurting help.

And $12 enough either funny part is, owners entirely blame. kept staff clock, even darkest days 2020, laid one off, would still employees. owners shot foot. side effects dose 3? Hahaha mate, already lost global power. 

Sincerely, rest world Businesses, Schools Hospitals completely stage walk out. 

Political leaders enforcing CDC guidance state vaccinated numbers up, covid numbers down, mandate mask instead play damn numbers game let people die left right.

Why front line, educators, medical professionals suffer asshat choices?

Honestly, takes street filled dead bodies overfilled crematoriums people wake up. Honestly Nintendo suspend game pandemic over, limit COVID-free countries. never aim vaccines 


I honestly care less original aim vaccines CDC. want prevent infection. CDC care infections fine, I'll ignore them.  Well hopefully won’t matter growing immunity vaccination rates. think it’s pretty expected younger cohort see case numbers rise I’d assume hospitalization stay lower that. I’m familiar Midwest/north vaccination rates among vulnerable populations. cases going doesn’t really matter long metrics retreat seeing UK. local Bell still two small round outdoor tables outside front doors. One even power outlet next ! many evening sat there, eating dinner, making use WiFi. Iirc everyone enters New Zealand, infected not, goes isolation hotel.  Today: 693,000 total shots, 307,000 first shots.

From Last Monday: 83,000 total shots, 14,000 first shots.

No stats, best wishes impacted Ida. think kind stupid wear mask college. Like we're packed like sardines 140 person lecture hall hour, mask really gonna help here? lol I'm absolutely going stop seeing fully vaccinated friends, wear mask socializing said fully vaccinated friends.

I'll mask indoors non-social reasons (grocery, walking around indoor space). 

I'm dining would prefer dining outdoors mostly due weather.

Reddit pretty much back ""March 2020-May 2020"" ""November 2020-February 2021"" mode terms hunkering staying going out, fully vaccinated people real world took pandemic measures seriously last year probably boat me. 

No one really wants go another winter hell socializing friends in-person eternally awful virtual/Zoom socializing, gets romanticized Redditors people hated it. personally, seeing friends last winter awful damaged mental health. I'm mostly recovered going back would destroy mental health again. Nobody wants work anymore shitty conditions shitty hours shitty pay. baby sister hardest time getting feet. Took half decade moved CA struggling working Target. Pandemic hit.
Went school...now nurse well. 

Have great day throwaway!   Pretty obvious talking Australia since guy replied mate immersive Van Gogh exhibit weekend surprised require this. honestly didn’t think inside dining rooms open fast food places, even Waffle House area pick only. assuming would different another country? I'm sure incident something like worldwide. Don’t care Hopefully extra push schools need make vaccinated children mandatory.

I already smell antivax antimask protests mile away. bad can't cake eat it. Federal mandate inevitable. Ok people compare spreading disease unintentionally drunk driving? Lol thread full double standards string together shitty argument. matter deadly disease is, going charge someone manslaughter spreading illness happens kill someone exemption that. reuse crappy analogy that's made million times like saying accidentally kill someone behind wheel drunk vs high Marijuana charged former case since latter seen ""safer"". absolutely legitimate compare situations spreading communicable disease could kill someone. would 100% brought defense case like ever went trial. I'm trying rational despite fact believe people getting vaccinated.  imagining little tubes like bank!! would go novelty that, haha. seem godawful giving good, practical advice seems consistent. Whatever reasons appears waffling wasting time, helpful.  Give quack emergency privileges hospital.

Make take care patient ICU.

Your patient doc. hospital makes clear assume liability quacks care patient. Yep know. pooled sample design, everyone still lines submit swab. I'm talking samples processed. Running 10 PCR reactions 100 people costs less running 100 PCR reactions 100 people. Anyway, sounds like they're individual testing rather pooled testing. Good.  elevate conversation considering quality mask/masking effort?  Chop chop.  Winter coming it’s looking covid doozy keep stupid. I'm fine that. mind brain poked stick twice week, it. Tests 100% reliable, safe enough.  hopeful optimistic future? 

Of course should. Vaccines working exactly intended, preventing serious illness death. witnessing real time around world. studies coming showing prior infection provides long-lasting robust immune response. pandemic lot sooner people think.

Some people base entire existence around feeling negative future, forecasting worst it. need find something productive focus energy pandemic wanes. wanted say sounds like lovely vacation. love going places alone. freeing. Yup I’d interested see statistics amount people getting Flu shots year. know friends become outspoken getting vaccinated never get flu shot. Hopefully covid makes people realize easy important get poke arm every think assumed 30% reported cases long covid. lockdowns brought back. Well many reasons trait might remain conserved, couple come mind plausible. example, traits exactly coronaviruses less likely change future SARS2 lineages, perhaps genes traits resting fitness peak part fitness landscape looks most/all coronavirus species. Also, traits ""hidden"" host immune system (e.g., proteins *inside* virus's envelope) might evolve slowly simply systems less likely clobbered antibodies host. Therefore, traits least likely remain conserved visible immune systems, like proteins resting outside shell virus. obvious candidate future adaptation spite protein, many proteins surface SARS2 could getting pressure host antibodies. And? vaccinated prevent getting spreading less vaccinated  Florida 1/4 many deaths one week state (Minnesota) entire pandemic. I’ve seen doubt continue see asshole snowbirds (people live MN spend winter FL) insisting Florida handling things better.

I'm dealing right going Canada - know actually go weekend get test result back days. driving nuts. Crazy immune considering bad news. I’ve covid storms people getting sick left right yet still haven’t got sick? I’m incredibly healthy. Weird. collapsing condos Unless going smash car front doors, really apply people live big cities, there's lot us. many drive-thru's found, assure you.... Department Education launched civil rights investigation whether states banned mask mandates discriminating students disabilities could higher risk severe illness Covid. 
The department's Office Civil Rights opened directed investigations five states — Iowa, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee Utah - barred schools requiring masks among students staff. 
“The Department heard parents across country — particularly parents students disabilities underlying medical conditions — state bans universal indoor masking putting children risk preventing accessing in-person learning equally,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said statement. “It’s simply unacceptable state leaders putting politics health education students took oath serve.""

It's time Federal government started taking active roll states overstepping power endangering everybody, especially children. Ummm… idk, tbh. think knowing beaches closed *definitely* kept people coming. course, beaches #1 COVID-safe activity available locals, lot conflict around that. we’ll get 10 years? hasnt caught yet spread family, grandparents 10 people therefore risks dont exist.

This sounds like sister. told ""i've gone bars, raves, concerts, everything imagine never got let house even though high risk, promise wont it, crazy overreacting""   Well least something good came this. It’s mostly loudest people. They’d probably arguing boosters every month. us ok waiting actual data percent efficacy decreases time. exception Upper Midwest, US seems peaking plateauing.

School starts next week places, expect sharp rises. 4. sounds ideal work real world. why, 1) order increase vaccine African countries, need increase manufacturing capacity Africa, donating vaccines. 2) Also logistic/legal/politic nightmare excess vaccines US ship Africa. 3) Also mRNA needed cold chain, wonder Pfizer/Modena useful there.  need protein based Novavax. I’m actually quite valuable, I’m troll.

If that’s call harassment, don’t know tell you, except harassing me.

My point home schooling difficult well, lot kids end homeschooled suffer it. response second shot all? honestly felt describing second shot. Fever, felt awful, stand, doc told go ER figured same. Got fever down, nausea, weakness, etc. i'm frustrated scared go again, maybe worse, booster :( HIV pandemic ongoing decades—the Covid pandemic didn’t wait HIV end first. everyone hip are. pulled ass, clearly live one MANY cities world. find many McDonald's Central London, example, wont drive-thru. assure suburban ones do, outsell anywhere near enough reach stat! outsell all. Preventing infection de-facto goal many countries administering vaccine. ""The original aim"" completely irrelevant conducive achieving policy goals. 


In practice Israel discovered even 90% at-risk population vaccinated, remaining 10% still overwhelm healthcare system virus allowed spread exponentially. Hence goal lower reproduction number 1 without resorting lockdowns, think they'll able achieve administering around \~3m booster shots. number far seem confirm predictions.  


Denmark Iceland Rt &lt;= 1, practice achieved herd immunity relying exactly mechanism, simply ""preventing severe illness"".  Still beats idling away gas 20 minutes. don’t know would work many classes essential workers there. need keep lights on, keep internet running, doctors, ambulances, emergency workers, grocery stores, things modern citizens need stay alive. many exceptions effective? enough vaccinations, exposures time it'll fizzle out. Already appears happening US. virus run people infect.

Its still got 100+ million people hasnt hit yet, nevermind reinfections. You’re suggesting decision makers use anecdotes data. That’s good idea. Seeing patients means they’re deciding fate 300+ million people logic based random person saw morning. That’s science works. absolutely looking big picture data Sue room 304 going through. UK data transparent; look technical briefings /r/covid19. Vaccinated people 50 1.8% CFR around 5% hospitalizion risk. deaths highest risk brackets, ignores 70-90% reduction infection chance vaccine. still strongly suggests protection high risk groups would high value. 

The second biggest risk factor age though exposure risk. retired person lives home low prevalence area far, far less likely exposed someone group home even apartment building Florida. 

A booster 8 months incredibly worthwhile compared cost. downside making someone else wait first dose. say anything option provide medical proof can’t vaccinated. saw another comment reporting judge reversed order. know got proof part appeal reversed reasons.

Definitely worse response second shot. I’m sure immunocompromised what. Naw vaccination rate Florida actually fair bit high national average. issue likely less lack vaccines lack controls like masks social distancing. Assuming everyone caught covid afford go doctor report ongoing tiredness brainfog weakmess. bold move cotton, lets see works out.

Thanks reply. articles saying vaccinated/unvaxxed viral loads clearly caveats. found couple studies saying basically said done delta predominant strain. Hopefully stays true foreseeable future. far lucky none strains, worse Delta already have\*, need keep top it, need Government willing act, strain happened.

&amp;#x200B;

\*I look difference UK &amp; USA, whilst true USA larger unvaccinated population, cant help wonder, worse strain Delta, UK. Plenty articles younger population ending US hospitals, seem case here. “WhY dOn’T HaWaIiAnS LiKe Us?!”

Maybe could express lane sun roofs? places Seattle  Anyone know get poster California without immune compromised? Interesting ""science"" agrees biased towards wanting happen ""trust science"", disagreement able immediately justify US policy ""the science"" anymore, therefore need trusted. According Ben Shapiro general populace that.

You correct. Turns ruining people's businesses lives turns things. federal government pretty much left states part, mess many states never meaningful regulations. dumb headline. flagged such. Headlines. I've fully vaccinated since May, live Florida back March 2020. I'm going work, grocery store week. I'm afraid I'll never able safe social life escape hellhole.

However, least 75% people grocery store today masked see kids leaving school getting school bus wearing them, there's actually masking last summer. takes 1 spread word thinking thing, sure hope want half business year. lol people live I’m sure won’t spend 100% time beach. you, don’t pretend like reason Hawaii wants people stay away. want McDonalds shut you’re introvert?

Just they’re open doesn’t mean you’re forced eat them. do. pick food return home. Yes clearly never Hawaii children many places. 



And wow. People supposed lock away children entitled jackasses like spread covid place? Seems reasonable. went checked, Wisconsin big outbreak starting September. Everyone else upper Midwest started rising October, going crazy November. checked southern states, almost peaked July, fell August, bottomed September. We're end August handful southern states showing signs peaking.

I'm trying pedantic. we're going draw parallels last year, we'd better precise. we're seeing upper Midwest mild outbreak, whereas last year cases flat October, spiked *fast,* slow two-month rise we're seeing now. South experiencing later stronger outbreak last year, peaking (hopefully) end summer instead midsummer. line cleanly.  white man gets upset getting nothing programs meant lift said minorities women up. Lol, enjoy winter. I’m surprised they’re vaccinated. Much they’re fanbase wont like that. agree masking taking reasonable precautions since delta spreading more. UK, McDonalds, restaurants, open indoor dining since May. Pretty much normal demographic eats there, wouldn’t they?  I’ve got stop someone fucking bat! always dangerous ride motorcycles ~~in US~~ though.

FWIW, ride motorbikes. US one safer places world ride. 


My friends health professions, said 2 biggest things avoid see them, ride motorbike, smoke. Probably add 3rd past 18months, vaccinated. trade current version Delta get upgrading early? would rather keep kids school send taught someone stupid get vaccinated. intelligence safety filter teach school completely reasonable.  *“You two times likely become sick COVID-19 again, unless you’re vaccinated,” Guest said. “So we’ve got two groups people COVID, vaccinated group significantly protected getting Delta variant unvaccinated group.”*

I'm vaccination encourage it, accurate? 

**Having SARS-CoV-2 confers much greater immunity vaccine—but infection parties, please:** high percentage vaccinated need go deem lockdowns over? 

Israel high percentage still COVID cases. certain point gotta let people face consequences choosing get vaccinated accept deaths happen among vaccinated though low rate. Illinois announced unvaccinated educators college students starting September 5th (as way circumvent vaccine mandate announced group). Personally would relax certification requirements, course increase pay too. Making teachers parents feel safe sending kids back school bring back far teachers loonies refuse vaccinate protect others preventable severe illness.

I know two different moms teachers, quit lack covid precautions. vaccine mask mandate, would go back instant, send kids back too. worst part teachers exactly ones comfortable staying home kids, instead going teach 20-30 kids. No, didn't, perhaps should. rarely watch anything Rick Morty occasionally. county Tennessee 9,000 kids school Thursday Get ready rafts boats carting around nurses bagging Covid patients flooded streets, followed days heroic yet odds unvaccinated boat drivers floating dead waters caught delta bagged there’s one left help them. 

How evacuation centers, odds new variant appear there? Superdome use time? news, water wet.... Lab leak.  NYT sent link (unreadable) article vaccine eligibility 12s coming end year. kinda wish they'd get shit together this, least let parents sign trials ""definitely getting real vaccine"" group. i'd rather kid guinea pig vaccine guinea pig childhood long covid.   Still Less daily cases Florida become endemic, antibodies vaccination infection make much less problem. COVID stay, pandemic end. saying something like flu pandemic 1918 never ended people still get flu. bad COVID, willfully ignorant sure making thing harder needs be. Yea, see mostly 4 year new grads. agree you, CNAs also LPNs know they’re getting tend realistic expectations. Actually best RNs know started CNAs LPNs. bizarre thing. Totally normal, loving marriage. Rational person. Caring loving mother.

Everyone things weird sometimes, honestly think, ""Suddenly anti-vax pandemic"" going hers.

I think there's decent chance end divorced vaccinating kids. makes sad, really know else it. Yep, went outdoor show last night US show vaccine card get in, still requiring us wear masks indoors city, wear use bathroom. I’m past four months third scheduled Friday delayed two weeks. think I’ll keep see data comes out. got Moderna I’m little confused waning when, etc. Fire them. Clearly public safety priority. happens governor economist health policy advisor viruses shoes. least require vaccination testing? That’s direction going chicago, many festivals fall require that.  Wartime army making deputized militias vaccinated vaccinate unvaccinated know. 

We know unvaccinated people close us. Loved ones. needle full vax hand, would nothing, respect choice die catch delta? we’re suddenly pro choice death awesome, let’s expand that. we’re not, choice vaccinated make; passively stand let Jill many others, stop them? UK much sequencing lot countries. There's probably tonne variants brewing world. random chance spreads opportunity is, equally could still happen somewhere like Australia random. Pfizer avaliable teens   Restrictions forever! Anti-covid essential oil Ahhh yes. cattle Corinth always special breed. set Chrysler apart made company today… contradicting consensus COVID stay? You’re probably better going way back beginning stomp whatever puddle emerged from.   condolences loss. sure you’re downvoted. brushed Delta variant spring wreak havoc spring, never know next major variant come. Tell worry want; reality never know variant become major threat; lesson learned Delta. let’s forget fact [Delta quickly giving plenty opportunities “Delta steroids” variant arrive coming months. like me, living home everyone thinking fine living life normal without care go way high risk getting pwned home. Yes, live restrictions forever, pandemics never end, right? run Greek letters, say switch pig latin Ngl used duckduckgo found sites Google. Tbh, want relay information people know arent getting vaccinated mainly AZ Australia right people waiting vaccines come whilst outbreak worsens. We’re really fucked get Delta Wolverine. That’s bold assumption. I’m sure actuaries people actually hard calculations. 

The IL governor mandated vaccines education health care — weekly testing. He’s taken hard line last year half, I’d wager guess reason giving people vaxxed. one lining teach practice podunk cornfield towns. Exactly. lot less school kids died covid

A lot less actually died virus.

Oh we're inflated deaths fallacy? No. ""Quantifiably proven"" ok tell efficacy Pfizer vaccine Delta variant then? I'm telling number study  live restrictions forever? chance dying you’re vaccinated extremely rare.   Protect kids. hope. forgive. dead kid can't, want unnecessary damage.  brutal cycle perpetuated decades private hospitals. CEOs charge hospitals, they’re incentivized keep expenses low name maximizing profit. leads hospitals hiring less employees lower wages opposed employees higher wages. result wages sufficiently high nurses spread thin, less college students attracted nursing profession. leads nursing shortage, puts pressure existing nurses leads high turnover rate, makes shortage worse. cycle driving nursing shortage decades COVID made matters worse. bright side, hospital CEOs making millions profits, clearly system must working 👍 need alternative solutions vaccines. Anti-vaxxers never fucking take them. Maybe vaccine pills go different name?  No. really do. this. It’s terrible. Lifting COVID restrictions mandates, lead cases, leads hospitalisations, leads deaths... Like Florida. Call D2 Resurrected  gave guidance know can’t follow, the;blame us following it. Social distancing better AC cost money schools don’t have.  utterly dumb bunch people last year end summer bc case rates low, we're going cold flu season kids going back school. going another wave Delta, maybe bad last year vaccines happening. 11 year old covid right now, thankfully mild infection far. rest us vaccinated tested negative since 11 year olds positive result. sure wish could gotten shot did. I’m sure employee facility charged, seems like could charge individual reckless endangerment, least, nothing likely happen them. countries serious, pandemic would know it. Earliest projections the.planning phase ~550k dead intervention, hospital system overwhelmed, etc. Early 2020 health care system knew, 'flatten curve' thing. Yes, doctor recommended booster soon 8 months post second shot literally debatable quantifiably proven. Go peddle anti-vax bullshit elsewhere. Look data outcomes children COVID. answer question. Reuters unbiased news

I've never found unbiased news source. Best really read variety sources, aware biases try discern ourselves. Read room… We're definitely looking better weeks ago. worried schools opening we'd see big spike far, reasonable mask mandate! cross posted Jimmy Dore page shocking someone commented how’s good thing. surprised all. I've homeschooled mine since beginning this, know can't keep schools open without mandate, idiot's gonna fight tooth nail. Maybe...but Disaster Capitalists exactly do.  I'd go 150k...145k unvaxxed. 2021.

Remember 2020; imagine 2022… worry man. I'm working time machine. I'm gonna go back 2019 fix everything /s point people believe drinking sea water would cure covid, stop them.

Social darwinism works. One wishes could sue school. \*sigh\* Fuck guy took freeze-frame Fauci lifting hand lowering exemplify flattening curve exact moment. fast? addition college?   Guess time buckle up. I'm vaccinated, wife not. We've already ""pre-fights"" whether vaccinate kids, able put main event argument kids young shot anyway.

We're clearly getting closer EUA 5+, 2+ probably far behind would imagine.

You've seen people vaccine reacted masks shot, I'm expecting nuclear war crowd kids ones discussed.

I'm trying save kids marriage time, point goals may end direct conflict. Fuck virus, man. Abbott located Alameda, they're probably flying there. 600,000 LAUSD students plus staff, that's lot tests run every week.

My youngest graduated LAUSD high school last year (thank god) far they've 2 cases. perfect world, that's going state right now. kids back. need teachers teach them.

The fact remains virus affect children much. Anyone reading froth mouth REEE damn fact. Another fact vaccine approved children FDA, Fauci (and sub) getting ahead himself. Another fact, I'll give credit alluding to, vaccine efficacy clearly much worse originally told. variants may become even worse. Given careful ""mandates"" start throwing around. emotion reason.

One relative particular posted NHS briefing saying along lines ""cant argue government report dont bother!!"" NHS briefing apparently shows 27% increased chance dying vaccinated?

Here briefing:

Oh...its letting post link.

Anyways I'm sure cursory search FB 27% vaccine NHS would pull up. stoked former public health official board healthcare corporation.  term “herd immunity” seems confusing you. “Herd immunity” simply means Rt &lt; 1 due virus immunity. doesn’t mean condition permanent, magically protects future variants.

Since start month, Rt Israel dropped ~1.36 1.1, primarily result ~1.9m booster shots already given. allowed Israel delay going another lockdown, spread still exponential long Rt 1 (including increase hospitalized patients). It’s estimated another ~1m individuals need get booster shots Israel Rt drop 1, precisely Israel trying achieve. 

There obviously magical block 1.1 1 somehow prevents reproduction number dropping 1, claim “herd immunity isn’t happening” completely nonsensical.   3% entire State California far. That's pretty staggering. I’m vaccinated J&amp;J, want get booster soon. wife Pfizer 14 12 year olds, soon available them. We’re waiting 6 year approved age group. know guy said we're 2x official number, link would suggest most, we've undercounted ~137K. Still terrible, want people know 2x according data. might reading article wrong seems specific product called Comirnaty fully approved 16+ US.  fucking hate  Disinformation. Latino race, hardly ethnicity me. Don't, live vicariously you. Take advantage freedom keep safe. It'll get better, hopefully, long new crazy variant shows up. Encouraging vaccination carrot stick would help. never said expert never said USA same. simply surprised see videos vast majority people public mask global pandemic going on. I'm sure triggered you, good luck that. immediate family got vaccinated soon became eligible (it initially tiered am), extended family split bit vaccinated AntiVa/AntiMa/denialists. 

It's super frustrating, unvaccinated group thinks vaccinated group (who generally longer socializes person unvaccinated group) bunch antisocial, paranoid weirdos vaccinated group gradually lost patience unvaccinated group. 

Like...we love you, auntie, enough sit poorly ventilated room bunch denialists birthday party ma'am, forget friends Facebook? know wear masks crowds *you posted pictures fun vacation* height last wave. We're gonna send y'all nice card. 

The problem although we've tried, can't logic somebody position logic into. look tetanus vaccine, find research indicates may need one every 30 years. like comparison obesity significantly difficult possibly unsustainable change lifestyle compared getting 1-2 shots arm. 

I'm extremely needlephobic I'm downplaying effort involved getting shot extremely easy eat unhealthy country, particularly poor. 

In addition obesity diet/exercise, may medical conditions make much harder lose weight others. vaccine pretty much equal opportunity all.

I think compare simple readily available shot major lifestyle change. got 2nd vaccine 4/20 (moderna) would opportunity get booster next weeks via health care connection. asked dr good idea said wait least 6 months would wasting booster. less. annoys I'd like pro-union, morons able morons union protects them. makes wonder unions good thing enable people moronic without consequences. name like that. Google variants.  There's quite few. Unfortunately, mandating vaccines certain areas country cause hospital staff leave job one fill it. 

It’s disgusting. I'm afraid death. Healthcare education gonna changed this. Heavily. 99.9% I’m confused naming convention. new variants came about, got new Greek letters. there’s something mutated delta, still called delta? Shouldn’t another letter? thought already delta plus, what’s gunna called, delta squared?  Nope, never said that. That’s pharmacy. choice, would Moderna.

First paragraph still valid thread I’ll leave up.  like exact opposite injuries went Army introduced helmets. friends measurable risk. grandparents are.

Yes it’s worse original variant peak go mostly away. getting numbers from? see 7 day average covid deaths currently 36 deaths per day missouri, 18 deaths per day August 1st.

That would 2x increase deaths, source showing 86%? she’s worried catching virus wear mask peace mind… it’s small sacrifice make someone. reading Rolling Stone? got vaccine 23 weeks along I’ll 39 weeks Tuesday. far know baby healthy be. I’m sorry deal that. I’ve known people manage chronic conditions (that’s I’m much trying avoid covid!), everyone idea people go good day, they’d worried long covid death severe disability. 

I think learn lot boosters rolled best go getting third protective dose. throw shots every day Florida. portion headline inaccurate you? Flu shots free US far know.  stores even entice come jabs store coupon. think may try claim shots insurance, I've never seen claim insurance statements. Almost 5000 infections new version Delta strain. wonder England 5,000 infections linked Boardmasters festival Cornwall, half million music lovers even larger events Bank Holiday, officials fear revellers hit new strain Delta variant

Also - infection rate 2,000 per 100,000. Pregnant people immunocompromized. Illnesses nothing normal adults make incredibly ill kill baby. See: flu, listeria, toxoplasmosis, etc. 

It absolutely higher death risk pregnant people, known year now. 

Like, want anecdotal evidence: I’ve read past, wasn’t sure arriving death tally.

It’s insane United States evolved this. entire childhood adult life always thought USA pinnacle. reality bizarre.  Hey, dealt couple nights ago! Lady claims FDA ""fully authorized vaccine,"" paste link FDA announcement FDA site posts Instagram link.

""Another media lie.""

""Umm.. directly FDA.""  Sorry, ""loving"" individuals help spread mutate deadly virus groundbreaking free preventative year goes 600k countrymen died. Yes, standard governance high, public corruption levels low, there's lot trust institutions.

I've watched addresses press conferences task force handling Covid, they've quite impressive.  It’s good thing don’t base laws analogies remove nuance one instance next. Covid dog can’t directly treat Covid infection dog attack. significantly reduces chances contraction, chances transmission, severity symptoms contracted, mortality rate people contract it

But cares things, right? mean, insane suggest thing. think actually possible. Like people 1) absolutely refuse believe facts (they consider facts nothing government propaganda attempts control minds) 2) foaming mouth believe crazy shit. 

So would really take small group influencers posit vaccine actually alien technology think people would believe it. haven’t able get vax. I’m 40s; varicella vax wasn’t really available early 20s consider childhood vaccine, uphill battle trying convince doctors it! Taxpayers spend millions dollars officer training equipment prevent getting shot getting killed gunshot. much lesser chance happening dying Covid. 

We probably get rid move laws since 99.998% cops won’t die getting hit traffic stop? literal quote someone called local NPR station. fucking frustrating. I'm pharmacist. elective surgeries canceled administration used excuse slash hours even tho workload almost doubled peak covid. Part timers got furloughed everyone got 20% hour reduction. twice patients less staff. headline makes pretty clear what’s said unless didn’t listen biology school.  **Don’t believe vaccine works**

Blame media public health messaging. Breakthrough cases used scare people clicking articles. Vaccines reduce risk infection, don’t make impervious. constant messaging since beginning. Even daily thread yesterday someone arguing vaccine prevent infection 90% vaccinated people regardless disease prevalence. 


**Afraid side effects.**

Just don’t good enough public health messaging, people talking social media really shouldn’t be. People unwilling acknowledge type side effect call antivax instead discussing like human beings. look rest comments here. divisive language makes people dig heels more.


**Don’t think need it**


I think feel way already think covid. offering antibody titers unvaccinated people see neutralizing antibodies. goal get everyone high levels neutralizing antibodies actually snuff covid.  No, really didn't. single day palm beach county everything actually shut initial lockdowns. farce. Thanks Cornwall Social media pretty scary, disseminates wild conspiracies people start believing acting upon it. Prepare see dangerous believers next several decades sucks, parent teachers fall I'm sure want near kid (not virus).  one? No. Put blindfolds back spend money like good citizens.  completely ignored comment. principle another vaccine working scenario automatically guarantee ever vaccine past present future work way. would help, r/nursing absolutely chilling me. hard read, even harder reading comments. 

If think amount stories would change mind, absolutely would read sanity. absolutely gutwrenching. War Worlds scenario Fox News instead Orson Welles. idea downvoted. family members needed wait last month get vaxxed health issues. 

I can't wait able entire family vaxxed. people wrote. also people who, shown video people dying floors hospital, wake get vaccinated. demographic reaching to. 

I understand HIPAA requirements. blur faces, show people videos people lying hospital floors, bodies piled funeral homes, on. thing true, right? show public videos photographs shock public taking vaccine. That's universal Healthcare.

Labor expense. Less labor = profit. want run Healthcare like business, keep expenses low possible.

The system already walking tightrope - comes COVID, bodycheck us right it.  One wonder beginnings mass hysteria phenomenon underway. Like people keep going nuts, point might start blowing shit think aliens controlling things trying impregnate humans pretending give vaccine, reality alien DNA. didn’t lead death it’s fine?

Hurry hell up. live shit state want kids covered ASAP.    Cue anti vaxxers seeing headline totally disregarding article clearly states causality hasn’t determined. News outlets irresponsible dropping non-news clickbaity way - knowing it’s nothing. may well put article; “Two Dead taking shit pyjamas”. doesn’t generate clicks - maybe would. supposed give benefit doubt shoot somebody “feared life”, don’t give crap least twice many die preventable death freedom make bad decisions.   “bagging” them.

Pro tip guess, don’t let tinfoil hat get rusty I'm teacher got sneaky booster want get Delta windowless classroom know *why* discouraged masks March 2020? wanted make sure healthcare professionals run mask shortage case epidemic became big (and small thanks Trump, federal pandemic preparedness extremely inadequate). Secondly, *novel* coronavirus; one beginning expected SARS-CoV2 nearly infectious spread occur significantly asymptomatic cases (SARS MERS minuscule spread, comparison). such, pandemics like evolve, data evolves, guidelines must adapt turn; anything, *good* thing (not sign incompetence) CDC willing change guidelines instead doubling sake perceived reputation. politicians similarly followed research data...  I've read say somewhere around 30% effective.

So worried girl masks matters.. Well driving drunk illegal unvaccinated infecting someone else totally legal  number animal reservoirs now, definitely thing. historic.  mean viral load population individual? 

Vaccination drastically viral load population.

Something young, less want young, done it... It’s tougher Oregon, least seems like. prove really part religious practice (not “Jesus told to”) employment still terminated refuse. Considering Delta viral load vaccinated people caught corona anyway risen lot, see reasoning valid longer. Even vaccinated required show recent negative test. enough nurses, hospitals don’t treat current nurses well enough, lot turnover. treated disposable left 5 years use new grads fill vacancies. didn’t high turnover could beefed staffing, would mean administrators getting smaller bonuses. Really? saying there's way get without vaccines? Well then, let's open case. know fixated kids classrooms pandemic can't see way hiring enough vaccinated teachers allow that. trying fix wrong problem. Looks like private well? 

The health care vaccination mandate applies health care workers state licensed state regulatory boards, including doctors, nurses, dentists, chiropractors, emergency medical service workers respiratory therapists.

It also applies students, workers volunteers health care settings, like receptionists medical offices hospital cleaners.

“Healthcare personnel includes individuals, paid unpaid working, learning, studying, assisting, observing volunteering healthcare setting providing direct patient resident care potential direct indirect exposure patients, residents, infectious materials,” rule says.

Balkan countries offer non-residents, that's passing Greece through.  Best path forward force vaccines, requiring employers schools require it. like polio, right even delta variations. Vaccinated people ones dying, vaccines supposed do. Keep alive. IQ test mandatory, they’re known stupid things name “freedom”. read article? clinical whole thing, I’m really interested seeing compare-and-contrast Lollapalooza recently happened Chicago. Lolla roughly 8x attendees, hundred cases tracked festival - surprising lot people somehow *wasn’t* super spreader event. Yes virus best avoid antibodies population antibodies likely spread fastest. 

Just like heat resistant strain something would spread fastest hot conditions APPLEBEES RATS! Could also make anyone entering US reason quarantine two weeks? still Emergency Use Authorization full approval children 12? comparing patients vaccinated unvaccinated, study, published journal Emerging Microbes Infections August 14, found vaccines overall protection rate nearly 60 percent Delta variant, 70 percent moderate symptoms 100 percent severe cases, Zhong said.

They seem confident vaccination prevent deaths hospitalizations.

Combined control measures like mask usage crowded spaces, could achieve effective herd immunity lowering probability spread enough outbreak dies quickly.

We've seen mask-wearing friendly nations perform significantly better places like US. UK releasing vaccines ages ∈ [18, 25] around late June, required 8 week wait jabs, wait get appointment, many covid waves unis June, many younger people literally chance get vaccinated. Canada now, imagine countries same, make things difficult unvaccinated US travelers want fly non-US airlines. McDonald's probably considering anyway. 85% fast food drive through, commercial real estate getting expensive. Plus staff less dining room closed.  Minimum wage state (NC) 7.25 Spolier : won’t get vaccinated. move goalposts little Smart move, half us fucking rocker. There’s still lambda variant seems evade vaccines better, right looks like it’s crowded Delta. I’ve also read somewhere recombination isn’t common covid e.g. flu. … every post NZ since went last lockdown comments saying “it can’t done”, “Delta different”, “why even try”. 

And create another strawman shooting people streets declare it’s worth it. 

Yes, real questions ask valid. yes, us NZ it’s worth continue protect people allow everyone wishes vaccinated. that, we’ll come back questions. Yeah, we're currently part plague, inc I've saving DNA points suddenly everyone's brain hemorrhaging. frustrating people overloading hospital system solution simple. Maybe mandate vaccinations healthcare workers maybe they'd nurses working. think 'require' negative lateral flow test, willing take festival goers word it. 

No proof vaccination required. need vaccinated attend Honestly numbers make sense all, NYC dashboard say 65% residents one dose jumps 77% counting adults. borough less 57% people vaccinated.

This trying tell 2 4 largest ethnic groups roughly 50% vaccinated? OK I'm saying Brazil US better, yes.

But EU US worse. Ok, pet peeve (in general, specifically OP), also agree call Dr Fauci? 

I believe education nearly 40 years public health service earned much respect.

^(*gets soapbox*) delta variant made untenable

Not quite. Small Delta outbreaks brought control several States. 

What made difference **one state** deciding ignore hard lessons successfully job right, allow outbreak starting **one known case** get control, re-seed states also New Zealand. 

One state premier trying one-up state got corona control **five times** political points put us here, forced whole national plan change try prevent spread states. 

We’ve *proved* that, small initial case load, *rapid* isolation (or lockdown isolation doesn’t work), robust contact tracing, outbreaks controlled let country get vaccinated level prevent health care system getting overloaded like Italy, UK, USA, Brazil, Spain, etc etc etc. starting happen NSW; probably, almost certainly, could prevented. 

The hope try keep bottled NSW, control (much smaller) case loads states, vaccinate quickly (also botched) vaccination program allows. 

The ball seriously dropped. Hodor! point data set? Ugh! That's even minimum wage county. requiring McD employees vaccinated? much cost you, process like able choose type vaccine? heard Greek friend it’s free I’m that’s everyone citizens 1 million COVID cases would probably couple thousand deaths. 

10000 - 20000 deaths 1 million covid cases unvaccinated people. new measure means staff work face face public – instance cafés, cinemas public transport – required show proof fully vaccinated tested negative coronavirus last 72 hours.

Whotf ""*the* Blacks""? family white people live subdivision? pick you, going, “ Nah, COVID can’t mutate even transmissible, doesn’t sound likely sounds like bullshit therefore don’t believe it.”

Not saying. saying hell prove got covid someone walked by? interview everyone guy walked test covid? Trace viral RNA see it’s same? It’s hard prove this. 

This say delta isn’t super contagious definitely is. Im pushing back specific claim looking fwd additional covid impact, I'm tired heat. vaccination rate reaches 80%.

The government said vaccination rates need ""high"", confirmed numbers. Delta variant thousands protesting streets last year got 700 day 0? 

yes getting sick dying stick, mind?  Scotland still mandatory mask rule yet cases still going up, nobody hear right? Instead hear argument 'Well cases going masks, imagine bad it'd without!' argument can't proven either way. Absolutely nuts. Agreed. 

Should multiple vaccine suppliers, quarantine facilities, local manufacturing basic healthcare supplies (we slowdown lack *sterile drapes* goodness sake). 

At least bought ventilators. Look, get sentiment, completely impractical. ER operator chance thoroughly check medical files patient showed door critical condition.

Greece can’t afford lose dime. It’s 3:38pm nothing announced yet meaning debate still rages haven’t come agreement. Anyway, it’s recommendation. 🥱 That’s thing, idea isn’t cases forever, it’s keep lid population vaccinated. Delta problem, even delta risk individual drops 60-fold compared unvaccinated. Wait McDonalds lobbies open again? got tested several months ago cost $300 (i pay it, insurance company did).  
$300 \* 600,000 students \* 30 weeks = $5,400,000,000

Permanent masking may slow virus down, stop it, long hospitals overrun, end place anyway far final body count without masking. Continued limitations gatherings long-term damage economy, inter-personal interactions fundamentally form basis society itself.

So like super escape variants we've seen changed enough longer highly transmissible therefore dominant strain cause big issue.

The issue covid relatively low death rate, moderate morbidity rate, extremely high level transmissibility leads large numbers cases. lots diseases much worse get individual level nearly big deal society happen much less. fully vaccinated least two weeks event provide proof past infection (in last three months) negative lateral flow test last day think.

It’s going magically disappear. try increase vax rates boosters coming except revax rates lower first round add social structure factors: % population able work remotely. % multi-generational homes. 

There's bunch factors could contribute little, bunch small cuts exponential growth rate could make huge difference end. Dumb take. He's still wearing seat belt (vaccine, mask) yes he's taking proper precautions allowed eat restaurant. Apparently 90% Duke employees already vaccinated. remaining Oct. 1, they'll fired, additionally ineligible rehire Duke future. approved medical/religious exemptions would require daily symptom monitoring, weekly surveillance testing, continued masking, ""other protocols.""

It's also worth noting 95% Duke students vaccinated, makes Duke probably one places students employees are. That's point. going charge someone death another caused communicable disease, go disease. covid? That's illogical. Old people vulnerable influenza. could make argument. going end bring vaccination card give one gotten before?  Ok mate Since posters bother read article itself, I'll add cogent information.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* anyone familiar immune system develops memory based responses, takes time, usually multiple challenges pathogen (virus case) importantly time challenges body/immune system develop mature, broad type response. Broad means immune system chances analyze various surface features virus, like spike, current COVID-19 variants 29 proteins, spike protein used mRNA vaccines, time develop programming respond various proteins, like antibodies, memory cells, cell responses. Ideally get broad robust (more troops) response time challenged (infected) broad response ideally protects even new variants immune system seen yet least proteins still recognized despite mutations elsewhere current/new virus.

So, many viruses, including known coronaviruses, takes least months immune system memory based broader response development, studies indicate immune system needs type time infections challenges (vaccines type challenge) fully develop broader robust response. means getting booster right second dose likely beneficial method training immune system, time required let system develop complex programming complex response better handle potential mutated variants. Israel might done disservice waiting longer, necessarily antibodies dwindle, antibodies dwindle infections produce successful immune response, that's memory based responses for, ramp back production defenses like antibodies cells blood stream overloaded antibodies infections get daily. immune system gets challenged various lesser pathogens time, bodies developed hack efficiently produce responses needed. Pfizer released last week study showed antibodies begin dwindle 4 months full vaccination, go 50% 18 month mark, likely still well protected 5month mark Israel boosting, 8 month mark United States currently boosting. What's different two may well immune system builds complex robust response mutated variants based much time in-between challenges (vaccines) allowed. crowd always cries “won’t someone think children!” Sure silent. Glad gendered potato head though. /s mean anything - article points out, definition long covid. everything mild fatigue severe neurological respiratory symptoms. Many milder manifestations also common seasonal illnesses. People literally feel bad cold.

Let's stop using Long Covid sort scary boogeyman and/or ""I told so"" kinda thing first decide even *is* first place. without government assistance, obviously. Gee, almost like government needs step emergencies. Children 12 able vaccinated currently. I'd like see protected. care costs hospital, care pay. costs completely meaningless me. pay 750 month really cover much. enough stop losing house get sick injured. That's completely insane.

This. Does. Not. Add. Up. downvoted lol someone clarify AVers saying “it’s *real* approval” though? medicalese discussed thread different misinformed talking point?   let’s go ahead force kids back school possibly get lifelong health problems. Yep. think would showed evidence judge any. haven’t heard single person refer Comirnaty Mike Ehrmantraut rolling grave rn moment realize McDonald's care health wellness 40% US population.

Maybe case it’s true, it’s common lie believe without evidence— sure would presented judge exists. fact don’t kids doesn’t change fact kids extremely low risk covid. low risk diseases things normally wouldn’t shutter homes protect from. Unless you’re one insane parents. let tell child knew kid mother like that. turn well all. Don’t parent. Made laugh, cry... still spread delta. spread vaccinated people, big deal. spread unvaccinated people, fault chose vaccinated. never reach point enough people vaccinated goes away. What's end goal? Never go inside again?

COVID symptoms unvaccinated children tend symptoms vaccinated adults. literally beneficial thing could imagine Federal government quickly boost vaccine numbers. 

It’s clearly area control.

BUT, need make sure people aren’t turning fake vaccine certificates. Plenty anti-vaxxers going going route soon, “Christian” pastors even giving congregations dispensation lie vaccine status. previous commenter arguing serious disease regard kids, significant statistical difference casualty rate. I’m believer escaped lab. evidence this. Amazon issue addresses ring cameras employees, employees sleep customers sidewalk, still get monitored Jeff ring camera. don’t worry, they’ll still charge employees $15 maintenance fees spied upon. world really needs India’s help. China, Europe US decent job India desperately needed.

Hopefully get enough population vaccinated begin feel comfortable exporting again. Taco Bell designed store drive thru lanes kitchen. store drive-thru open crew new teaching basics get training overwhelm quit. GM trying geet permission pay let us $14 now. costs lot live too, 1 bed $2200/month mention utilities top that. college town waiting see many college people apply.

America used patriarchy white Christians. rapidly becoming browner, secular, feminist, etc.

people can't openly discuss anger treated default American due race religion anymore, since socially unacceptable promote that, people get upset stupid shit like mask mandates instead.  depends close bridge ocean  it’s really mostly particular vaccine folks worried about

Which one would be? Pfizer Moderna, mRNA ones? old school ones, like Astra Zeneca Johnson Johnson? Big Pharma American one, Chinese one, Russian one, Cuban one? University developed one?

At point there's vaccine ""hesitancy"". US kinda always like that, least living memory. Spoken like someone without kids.  Toss couple +!&amp; better password T-Mobile Why? reported NZ death pfzier. think worse hide it. 3 million people vaccinated deaths, risk tiny. somehow missed part shared custody? Well, always edit comment brief apology wasting people's time. Well get vaccinated! working people getting sick, ridiculous get vaccinated. Delta Delta Delta? can't help ya help ya help ya!

 Weeks ago? argued. Today? still spread delta.

I put blame infrastructure though honest. understand live area situation inconvenient try find place outdoors eat, take food home. Covid around long enough patios converted outdoor dining facilities people get house still relatively safe.

And fair, child young vaccinated, would probably less strict certain things point. Curious think mood like r/Coronavirus. hopeful optimistic future? so, think that? trolling trying prove anything, I'm genuinely curious. hated working non union factory reasons. Company would always try cut break times, first removing ability split lunches cigarette breaks. demanding punch lunch specific times, time clock rounds 15 minutes. Causing lose upwards hour worth pay/break per week. adds real quick realize spent 15 plus years said company break system entire time. Delta would came anyway would never bad. take frequent, extended hydration breaks peeing. Yes, true. 

There's also lot variants throughout world similar levels increase 2% even more, seemingly flukes.  
You check B.1.604 Turkey India right see variant completely unconcernimg yet still managed achieve 2% even 5% prevalence countries' recent sequencing. 

It's SA data would look different concerning variant-- 40 cases observed month, there's lot possible explanations too. UK ""festival strain"" likely gone 1 2000 cases week, Delta. Children 12 negligible risk covid. That’s fact. totally understand scared child. shutting businesses burdening society unfounded fear child *just might* weird unknown consequence virus statistically poses almost risk them. completely unreasonable. Nope. Kept putting off.   article explain account Latinos white? 

Probably way account black asian Latinos Hispanics. don't.

As mentioned, Latino racial group cultural identity. One race also Latino Hispanic. mean obviously know happen. Let's hope not. let's hope even does, like Delta, vaccines still leave high level protection severe disease death even get infected. peak 132,000 Jan.

We end November 2020 levels now. That's asinine. pay fraction listed better paying full amount? read something back, vaccine manufacturers said matter.  Simply tell people either way vaccine trial, trial results good.

Of course use common sense here, could probably cripple immune system drank heavily enough People fully vaccinated need quarantine contact someone COVID-19 unless have symptoms, per CDC ammunition naming         plus delta plus Cost living bridge probably higher Maine though Ah read it. Medical Center, yes. lot work immunocomprised patients. serious it. want clamp number vectors threaten patients. policy spread Medical Center University itself.  Scott Gottlieb pretty accurate IMO. Unfortunately overweight kinds health risks often it’s something fixed determination/healthy lifestyle. Well course want look way countries pay nearly much, government paying bill. thing ultimately matters comes pocket. Delta dominant strain SA variant went 0.2% May 2% July. means increasing quite fast may potential replace Delta. need wait bit see happens variant. Perhaps dangerous. hope not.

Facts power. Facts write laws, delete posts take people court. People do. Misinformation laws policies based facts are. They're based people power say facts are.

Verifiability matter either. There's always human decides whether verification taken place. [Early I'm seeing now. Read without proper documentation doctor detailing said reactions, one say whether “very good reason.” Saying she’s bad reactions doesn’t prove anything. basically bunch ways visualizing family tree family reproduces waaaay faster humans. viruses act something like this, accumulate mutations much faster living organisms (although SARS-CoV-2 particularly fast mutating viruses go). Fuck covid-19, indeed! Jeffrey Leving piece shit get custody clients. Ask ex parents lost house (185k custody battle). throw accusation sticks. 
However; parent vaccinate. No, that's case here. pre-insurance bill means services actually cost, pay. There's massive difference. stating matter country in, costs high since hospitals cheap run. never see actual costs bill elsewhere. Hospitalizations too. Maybe read article commenting? Hamburglarami. Also known Hamberder Hamburgler.

We offended ancient arches, ONE MILLION INFECTED uncommon cops shoot puppies feel danger. need know risk assessment. Seems like could easily test yourself, given enough time interest.

The sequence Wuhan strain genetically engineered it, would mean they'd used sequence virus. download bunch viral strains, use [free BLAST find sequence matches. 

It seem like would worth effort manufacture deadly virus. mean, seems like would stupid thing do. Researching viral codes find deadly parts viruses, using vectors try get genes virus. culturing it.

Just seems likely originated own. Never attribute malice, easily attributed stupidity? saying? raise them

Exports highly politicized last time around

Even enough supply, would political shitshow go ahead  new strain Delta rather entirely new variant

What heck mean? strains variations earlier strains? hate terminology. like calling someone “independent” vote one way 90% time. anti vaxxer. Call spade spade. vaccines safety concerns. dangerous Astra Zenica's Covid vaccine thousand times safer Covid-19, which, incidentally causes blood clotting problems. really low groups. placeholder calendar article sometime back saying early September/around Labor Day 5-11 approval recently removed it.  Well vaccine still kept  encourage son take tests still (Whole family fully vaccinated - 2 shots weeks ago)... weekend sister got (teacher, fully vaccinated)  Fellow retired nurse here. happened sub couple weeks ago. feel do, dismayed. people ever behaved past. working life spent inner city public hospitals. I'm stranger homeless derilict, even folk usually minded manners. wish nurses would stand strong together. Unfortunately younger ones mad keen litigation. Instead solving minor personality clashes, using people skills, go straight covertly logging incidents. logged enough evidence HR pitbulls called in. Unwarranted tickings high list things junior nurse finds intolerable. time fellow nurses worked like galley slaves, take offense crotchety senior nurse. kinder day.   well, go. anyone else think it’s kind morbid u/FantasticEducation60 considers people dying “good everyone else”?

Pretty inhumane imo  something really concerns me.

Masses health care workers leaving since pandemic due poor working conditions burnout, gotten worse since.

As society seriously need figure reverse trend make life little less difficult you, really clue even start... Honestly I'm pro vaccine gets, revolving door big business regulators sick.  I'm pretty fucking sure clear winner here. lockdowns masks people working home fewer people died car accidents, flu causes actual amount COVID deaths higher excess mortality.

But also lot medical procedures cancelled pushed back COVID excess mortality due conditions treated time.

Wonder one really mentioned press conferences articles? Even one, Asians mentioned.  go school. else government do? Cancel school 3 years? Lol nice plan.

Do idea lose sleepovers first place? don't. absolutely maddening pandemic shown people, including laypeople media political leaders, simply can't understand statistics data either interpret communicate them.

Delta notable contagious data makes kids sicker variants. kids getting schools opening. gets constantly misinterpreted misreported ""Delta worse kids"". RATE illness same, vast majority cases still mild illness. cases schools open, delta making sicker. ""Long Covid"" thing primarily people got seriously ill begin -- i.e. kids.

I get people worried nobody wants kids sick information information people look informed. Can't wait boycott McDonald's much sympathy people willingly put risk. humanist are! pat back! Uhh absolutely would consider 30 cars deep given time thriving. I’m way would always busy thriving? must young stupid vast majority people vaccine hesitant gotten vaccinated. 

At point someone hesitant get COVID vaccine anti-vaxxer. vaccine FDA approved mountains evidence terms studies statistics. Also, people long COVID includes infected vaccines available (one available them).  Yeah no. can't even look menu chick-fil-a expects order. would sure. hold convictions tightly foundation weak. break get shot soon vaccinated becomes convenient vaccinated. seems huge chunk Israel's population children Logic, gotta hand Germans.   UK 95-96% antibody positivity covid population, due combination vaccinations &amp; prior infections. meanwhile cases increasing pretty rapidly there. seems like bar herd immunity slowing virus reach. 

due mainly delta variant need keep mind vaccines primarily developing serious cases / hospitalizations / deaths (and perfect ones even that). virus keep plowing along thru population imo vaccinated, almost certainly get covid already even possibly already, vaccinated. protect statistics worst outcomes get done. absolutely right, reading report requires nuance. think information ever hidden important present correctly. Sorry going this, speedy recovery!  That's like saying “let's eliminate flu” point. think safe assume COVID stay.

Consider moment 80% society fully vaccinated COVID-19: unlikely get infected, even odd chance do, likely get severe disease. top that, factor base COVID exactly way shape form extremely deadly VAST majority people anyway.

At point realize basically locking entire country disease basically much deadly **(in vaccinated society)** flu. theory, still fall apart practice. hermetically sealed environments, can't account people they're premises. course, *doesn't* work, see antimaskers pointing case study favor. Southern Georgia here, it’s likely due staffing shortages.

Things going well? filled people want get back normal quicker.

Things going badly? filled people want restrictions.

Same always was. Good move. US failing let vaccinated people travel EU possible direction months stupid. reciprocating. learned weekend anti-vax family members got vaccinated weeks ago. 100% last spoke June. Turns child needed get vaccine school felt together family. That’s 3 vaccinated! Idaho ranks near bottom states country number hospital beds per person. Something keep mind medical infrastructure US definitely consistently great pretty bad many areas. saw possibly worst entire pandemic. anybody survived spring 2020 NYC take virus extremely seriously beyond me. unlikely throwing baseball child long distance hurt badly, even hit them. Would let someone throw baseballs kid?


This change fact children low risk covid. Forcing mother vaccinated small risk makes sense similar things larger risks. goes personal freedoms complete government overreach imo. said, can’t read article due paywall. read different one, short little blurb. 

The article said mom reportedly previously vaccine reactions said couldn’t vaccinated. made suggestion child getting vaccinated (if mom can’t). German government currently requires people vaccinated, test negative recovery certificate enter indoor restaurants, visit hospitals nursing homes attend events, parties sports southern state Baden-Wuerttemberg's social ministry proposed banning unvaccinated adults restaurants concerts altogether, restricting ""If hits intensive care units, act,"" Thomas Strobl, Baden-Wuerttemberg's deputy leader, told Bild Sonntag ""It would wrong hold everyone jointly liable, including vaccinated. That's different rules unvaccinated vaccinated.""

Sounds fair me.  clearly factor second, much bigger jump 15th. Interestingly, try changing age groups - age groups seen massive spike, there's schools (notably, community transmission), even significant driver.

Electing Larry Elder governor would certainly prove that. :|  yet children adults dying unvaccinated bioweapons. seems me. murdered cold blood.   Convince US government mandate vaccine.  numbers covid cases, hospitalisations, deaths continuing rise across UK, latest figures shown. England, 200 705 people tested positive covid-19 week 18 August, 5% previous week highest figure since week 21 July, figures published NHS Test Trace 26 August Scotland—where schools restarted summer holidays—a record 5021 daily cases recorded 25 August.2 “Undoubtedly gathering people together schools fuelled extent, see proportion younger people testing positive,” said John Swinney, Scotland’s deputy first Overall cases covid-19 rising across UK restrictions mixing eased since June, seven day average 2000 cases May peak nearly 48 000 mid July.3 Cases fell 26 000 day since climbed seven day average 32 000 17 rise cases comes UK’s Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation reportedly set announce roll covid-19 vaccinations 12-15 year olds coming England, Public Health England’s weekly surveillance data week ending 22 August showed covid case rates highest aged 10 19, seven day rate 616.5 per 100 000 Alicia Demirjian, incident director covid-19 Public Health England, said, “Cases covid-19 still high, especially among young people. closely monitoring start term impacts number new infections review recommendations Public Health England’s data showed hospital admission rates across age groups 7.74 per 100 000 population, 6.75 per 100 000 population previous Figures Office National Statistics showed week ending 13 August, UK whole registered 652 covid related deaths, increase 6.7% previous week highest weekly total since March year.5 Anne Cori, mathematical statistical modeller Imperial College, London, said upward trends likely continue coming weeks children across UK return school adults go back office mixed indoors autumn “In scenarios modelled, cases, hospitalisations, even deaths continue rise weeks,” said. “But high peak hard anticipate. still don’t know exactly extent protection given vaccination previous infection, long protection Figures Public Health England showed 1 February 15 August 2021, almost half (183 133 386 735) sequenced genotyped delta cases emergency departments England people vaccinated. half overnight inpatient admissions delta (4033 7285) third (390 1189) delta related deaths occurred unvaccinated people.

See Yes. This. Vaccine safety balancing act.

The existing vaccines clearly much safer catching covid.  They're clearly safer unvaccinated area nontrivial levels community spread. 

But 100% ""safe"" absolute sense.  There's point where, low level COVID prevalence -- likely unattainably low current world forseeable future -- vaccine would damage disease would longer make sense proactively immunize everyone. 

What ACIP answer: benefits vaccine worth cost adverse events happen recipients?

Just make hypothetical, measurable benefit booster shot 8 months males aged 16-25, risk myocarditis Pfizer Moderna shot #2, likely make sense ACIP recommend giving booster everyone age group. taco bell (northeast Ohio) can't keep consistent hours due staffing.

This kind contagion wholeheartedly support. hit miss though whether given location ask see vaccine card though. They're supposed to, experience far around half restaurants actually enforcing it. 

That said city start actually handing fines restaurants non-compliance mid September (currently businesses ignore mandate repercussions), things may change around time. Amazon 2022: Rise Equisapiens. Sorry comment overly brief gripe. Agreed everything. main point regarding many states provide better situation overall real crap shoot state state vaccines approved ages, fully expect case. documented medical exceptions, course. read full article reservations. want politicians giving medical advice making medical decisions people (looking TX, FL similar) judges able it, either.

 According article, mom's doctor advised vaccinated due previous vaccination reactions. Maybe mom's doctor woo-peddler full shit, knows.

Covid sucks.   wager. third world countries I’ve require high school.

You’d go somewhere like Somalia Afghanistan might compulsory.

So “most” definitely wrong. Thanks reply. Makes sense estimating capacity complex. case California, clear governing capacity? is, order treat marginal COVID-19 patient, would hospital system need add of? Maybe California situation literal beds?  Seems like low-cost solution case, though. Sounds great, eventuality politics getting involved....can see headlines now... ""Federal forced brain drain""...""Feds strip states""....etc... They're supposed announce week Ontario too.  I'm sure that's issue. Even every state government federal government mandated strict measures, shocking chunk Americans either a) still believe hoax, b) believe worse cold flu, c) see measures impinging personal freedoms, d) believe life must go on, people live lives, okay people needlessly dying, etc.

This much cultural issue anything else. guess Scandinavian summer people outside, school etc, vacation etc, delta really hadn’t gotten going June. also don’t close proximity family Italy Spain. thing happened last year. also pretty good follow restaurant restrictions like. Almost one uses masks though.

I think might rough winter, luckily vaccinations limit damage there’s still enough random breakthrough/vulnerable/children make nasty new wave. mcd's taco bell near never even reopened

you go wendy's though Yeah cancel tickets refunded I'm pretty sure. we're vaxxed see issue is.

Just require vaccine card? Eh, thought dumb waste money 0 qualms cashing check sent me. you’re gonna bankrupt nation, I’m gonna shoot foot twice refuse free money. perspective screw job 7.25 hr. is, made first job teenager early 90's. Gas still like 90 cents gallon, rent way cheaper now. 7.25 hr. paycheck f-cking insult. also, kids always get viruses school! Even covid germs always spread easily schools.  Im sure reduce ammount employees use, make way work compensate, pay ammount. think current wave cresting parts US. makes sense shorter smaller wave previous waves percentage people vaccinated exposed.   can’t validate opinions gives credibility. 

Everyone getting vaccine. I'm Michigan, couple complete shutdowns everyone takeout only. doubt want really give fuck. Good luck there. also true locality might literally beds, instead estimate capacity, want always beds available case emergency, even bigger emergency. California got hot water last year reported beds meant estimated capacity.  Shit like many antivaxers? random foreign metal make vaccine?

I’m vaxed friends point stuff like Agreed. came back sub taking break felt things getting better causes even anxiety I’m back. Especially look bed. really need put phone across room.  least minorities forced medical procedures touchy subject. don’t understand white people much vaccines US understand minorities wanting anything them. Something something state rights 

Mumble mumble small goverment said masked visits sleepovers (because nobody sleeping mask).

Right, child vaccinated. Meaning child vaccinated sleepovers given. Yeah isn’t opinion, it’s observation prediction. 

Congress acted pretty freaked side effects last Stimulus bill. lot unsaid worry impact inflation actions Fed taking respectable Senators like Romney. 

They’re unlikely anything cause additional economic disruption, ride out. That’s McConnell Co flipped mask policy rhetoric Delta became apparent. Another study said something Tyson announced $10,000 weekly lottery vaccinated workers, last 5 weeks. Anyone vaxed October fired.   I've people tell me, result headlines surrounding study, think people get purposely infected avoid future infection.

Think shit second. Hope everyone great safe. medical condition. mechanical heart valve medium gradients now, minimal level heart failure. Also, myocarditis Pericarditis result heart condition.

US travel ban list completely outdated makes sense. Heck, even China still list despite close zero cases. 95% doctors vaccinated, that’s good enough me. vaccine available children 6 months old next year. Perhaps offer online option one semester? fewer students classroom reduce transmission rates. Holding classes outdoors possible would also help.  Make sense, thanks! Says *have cars!*  Less Florida man heavily pushing mobile ordering. people on-boarded used it, they'll fine.

It's disingenuous try paint long drive-thru lines sole even main reason revenues dropped. menu issues even covid exacerbated it. $15.20 GVRD still living wage around $22 higher now. 2000, stop Supreme Court picking President instead American people stop shit we're now. actually main reason pre-covid anytime went fast food place saw line drive thru. I’d park car go inside. Almost always got faster service. I’d always take mental note I’d line usually 2x faster going in. Go ahead don’t eat garbage anyway. oh they'll back FL demands Fed funding, go wtf, cause amount external help anything curb surge common sense mask mandates implemented. respond with...Oh freedoms, make children wear masks. pretty good assumptions. ton sympathy unvaccinated, really keeping mind people - vectors disease - spreading children, waiter bartender breathe on, poor cashier grocery store.

Simple fact fully vaccinated ton stop transmission delta variant and, hate say it, breakthrough cases beginning lead hospitalizations worse.

Just careful end zone dances people die, always know full story got there. Here's school's news posting website, link town might SHITTY WAGES GIVE delta happens fire 25% already short staff? then?  hospitalization rate people 40 extremely low? mind people getting vaccinated, us favor avoid around people. Negligible risk DYING, sure. idea completely a-ok kids flu-like symptoms die pretty shitty take. someone hasn’t seen family nearly two years, really pains agree you. It’s insane international travel hasn’t reopened fully vaccinated people. I’m sure every living encountered mRNAs. Live Florida..none fast food restaurants indoor seating open months think wrong, spread. Lot's people key LIMIT spread! fiancé plans honeymoon go France Spain. fully vaccinated we’re hopeful Vaccine started rolling would see case numbers drop, went ahead booked hotels. Delta fellow American idiots getting vaccinated might cancel. Unvaccinated people spread virus. Increased spread virus increases chance mutations. Mutations potentially less likely prevented vaccine.

Ergo, unvaccinated willfully endangering vaccinated. don’t think know yet, hope it’s something look Kind topic good friend mine antibody levels increase since infection 8 months ago. tested May last week numbers doubled. sure ""several"" studies one preprint study recently waiting peer review etc.

Back day ""chicken pox parties"" parents would deliberately expose kids make immune. Covid dangerous chicken pox probably great idea. however focus vaccinating risk people first, basically done, vaccination rate 65+ lot higher 12+. month. Last one 3 months ago. couple days able get hold asked regrading condition. basically said wrote comment. lot low-to-mid tier chain restaurants US now. Servers basically relegated food/drink runners much else.

I always put thing facing away floor play fucking ads constantly. Taking child somewhere serves purpose, expected take reasonable precautions. refused take reasonable precautions would allowed visit child. vaccine reasonable precaution. publications particular feel heavy medicalese? agree writing scientific material consumption general public special skill (actually pretty close scientific technical writing part income), press release linked another user bad insofar medical info.

If vaccine B 95% effective blocking symptomatic infections, and

vaccine C 90% effective blocking symptomatic infections...

How would describe much effective B C?

\- think it'd (95-90)/90; 1.056 times effective.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm right compare efficacies vaccines B C, think following analysis recent [Israeli spot-on:

The conclusions Israeli pre-print strongly disagree general consensus vaccine efficacy.

For instance, pre-print study suggests convalescent immunity (aka 'natural immunity') 27 times effective vaccine-induced immunity symptomatic infections.

So, convalescent immunity 100% effective symptomatic infections, 27-fold efficacy ratio would set upper-bound efficacy vaccine-induced immunity 3.7%... waaaaay lower seen every study.

What needed somehow include 16,215 individuals vaxxed infected June 2021 baseline compare efficacies convalescent vaccine-induced immunity.

From there, they'd need look relative reductions types infections compared baseline.

For example, 540 16,215 naively immune folk got infected time period, we'd do:

540 - 19 = 521 infections avoided via convalescent immunity

540 - 238 = 302 infections avoided via vaccine-induced immunity

From there, 521/302 would describe relative efficacy ratio convalescent v vaccine... 1.73 times effective avoiding infections.

I've never seen paper compared 'interventions' one another without normalizing first control group. (where 'interventions' vaccine pre-infection).

This third ""booster"" shots given Israel. data shows increasing resistance 280% (or 2.8 times less likelihood Hospital admission death). temporary (and now, effective) solution updated vaccines hit market.

The good thing mRNA (ie: Pfizer, Moderna, etc.) vaccines easily quickly modified effective newer Coronavirus variants (like Dellta, Delta Plus). competition (AstraZenica, etc.) take much longer develop produce updated vaccines.

The mRNA story fascinating. used since 1990's (so way, ""new"" nearly 30 years old), ""untested"" GLOBAL scale science groundbreaking tested successfully things.

For example, Embryonic Stem Cell research caused much controversy early days back then, could harvested discarded embryos, mRNA - Scientists could TELL body proteins make could PRODUCE Stem Cells, etc.

[Leo Getz Florida data populating Worldometers? Change demand 6 month everyone December early April rushing. include people jumping ahead. Plus idiots vaccinate yet.

Also lot vaccine companies winding down, restart again. Keep 8 month avoids long waiting lines. one thought would sort vaccine quickly did, science proved wrong too.

I still refuse dine indoors. there's vaccine under-12 year old, I'm willing expose unnecessarily. wouldn’t move Florida reason.  know anything McDonalds. people sitting inside eating Drunk college kids hobos kind news this? anything empowers Antivax nuts. haven’t McDonalds years, went weeks ago needed food kids looked easy. dining room closed, citing local health ordinances… region current mandates/regulations. think lot stores realized dining rooms don’t make much money, especially stores best neighborhoods, it’s worth hassle. think struggle see enforced government respecting private property rights forcing property owners harbor homeless?

My point enforcing private property rights requires enforcement homelessness. even tack value judgement, two things part parcel. Omg pic upside sign… classic London Ontario we're seeing 20 30 day 11 hospitalizations less 5 ICU. I'm bit nervous start school masks cohorts hopefully things work out. We're 83% 12+ vaccinated Unfortunately, proves point. People Florida have, part, decided they're going live restrictions, get vaccinated. paying price stupid decisions, made decisions.

Maybe said ""the pandemic"" society says is, ""countermeasures pandemic"" society says are, better worse.

The situation UK much closer personal vision best possible scenario hope - high vaccination rates allow lift restrictions without catastrophic levels death hospitalization, even though hospitalization death still pre-crisis levels. surprise? knew beginnings effecitivty infection, hospitalization death lower vulnerable (that 95% average across age/risk groups), otherwise insist vaccinating 20 years old protect risk. 

80% still pretty good plainly need maintenance measures like masking, avoid crowds unnecessary BS. Yes someone answered already, literally every student staff member lines weekly gets tested. It’s lot labor district willing it. Yeah, judge forcing hospital provide treatment prescribed *outside* doctor, huge problem with.

However, understand it, hospital declined use Ohio law defense would given right refuse treatment believe it, odd.

Overall think bad situation almost everyone making mistake. doctor prescribed it, patient tried force hospital staff use it, hospital provided better defense. Thanks!

Cooking books like crime, they're directly contributing people thinking big deal, hence vaccinating, masking, etc.  Get dude I'm really sure, know $25 2 pack kind rapid tests sold local pharmacies I've to. I'm Midwest states. constitution…. Oh wait, nope. That’s it. 

Nothing many thanks NYC too. Literally moved away shithole. Serious question here, what's end game we're going perpetually spreading covid even vaccination? evidence matters attention. Vaxxed, wearing mask required &amp; avoid patronizing places require there's alternatives. Damnit… Happens time, called hospice. One killed 650k americans year, contagious flu, much deadly. comparing two shows exactly qhat capacity operate from. It’s fine. I’m vaxxed. I’m worried. wear mask don’t accidentally spread asymptomatically. everything normally do. mostly don’t want pay employees clean dining rooms. Thanks, covid! mean lied said needed first shot. said gave real name birthday issues. got first two shots early (January 2021) vaccination event held hospital guessing entered kind database. 

Since boosters approved immunocompromised, friends go say need third shot immunocompromised. CVS site proof condition would asked for. So..🤷 addition masking etc, one major disruptor flu travelling north-south hemisphere dramatically. Normally flu ""jump"" flu season flu season different sides globe.

We know Delta needs 3-6fold antibodies neutralize compared alpha.

Together, starts paint picture somewhere around 6-12ish months may want start boosting. Personally think 6 months 55, maybe closer 8 younger. I'm also cautious, feel like doses may well use going send overseas. Proactive MUCH better reactive Thanks; think main concern is, mentioned, infinite options interpret relative risks faced population study... reporting relative risks leaves folk conclude whatever like.

Given breadth health database utilized researchers, believe could discover baselines seek simply querying databases unvaccinated folk whose first infections occurred June-Aug period.

In end, think baseline info would useful; though perhaps news outlets people like people understand relative risk say, use making policy. Stupid, vaccinated change contagious. Idiots running country  make less likely catch COVID may months encounter problem again. again. again.

I'm saying media injecting vaccinated fear eventually realistic thing realize COVID stay. Long-covid extremely unlikely vaccinated individuals. Generally vaccinated experience COVID infections much bad cold, absolutely sure read CNN article screaming one guy got long-covid despite vaccinated lol

EDIT: said, obviously getting booster better shot going waste I'm discouraging getting one. I'm trying push back media fear mongering people believing vaccines useless. dumb?! 🤯 make wise decisions get this.

Fuck Fauci !! It’s mutate easily, IMHO it’s they’re damn infectious. Flu spread droplets, mutates easily yet seem able somewhat control new vaccines every year.

Also mRNA vaccines still effective variants variants like delta high viral load overwhelm immune response. Bravo New Zealand offering orders countries need.  like SHUT completely 2 months get rid smh. Atleast new variants seems peoples symptoms come much quicker less asymptotic spread. really differs European countries. Netherlands (for now) low case count nearly mask wearing more.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""LOS ANGELES — hundreds thousands kids return class nation’s second-largest school district, they’re participating amounts massive public health experiment unfolding real time: Every single student, teacher administrator Los Angeles public schools must get tested coronavirus every single week — indefinitely.

Even fully vaccinated required get tested. test positive stay home least 10 days. decline get tested can’t come all.

Along multiple protocols Los Angeles Unified School District implementing — including masking mandatory vaccines teachers staff — amounts far aggressive anti-coronavirus campaign undertaken announced major school district United States. comes classrooms nationwide struggle return in-person learning amid delta variant surge, governors trying block mask mandates even outbreaks shut schools delayed planned re-openings Florida, Texas, Iowa elsewhere.

In Los Angeles, contrast, vast majority parents, teachers students embracing least tolerating stringent measures district adopted, fewer 3 percent district’s 450,000 K-12 students opting remote learning instead. remains seen whether L.A.’s ambitious approach prove successful keeping district’s approximately 1,000 schools open entirety school year, local leaders public health experts say district raising bar way that’s watched closely could influence educators nationwide.

“I think we’re setting standard reopening schools safely 2021,” said Smita Malhotra, district’s medical director. “What district done really quite amazing.”

To pull daunting task administering 500,000 coronavirus tests weekly across sprawling district, L.A. Unified contracted two medical companies provide around 1,000 licensed health-care practitioners. health workers travel school school mobile units conducting overseeing nasal-swab tests — PCR tests produce accurate results. tests flown twice-daily lab Northern California aims turn around results 24 36 hours. price tag hefty chronically underfunded district: around $350 million. L.A. County paying $80 million sum, district trying get federal government cover rest.

School started Aug. 16 students L.A. Unified, end second week district reporting nearly 3,000 active positive cases among students others. number rising day, seven cases linked within school setting, elementary school Hollywood — like rest district’s schools — remained open. Anyone testing positive sent home quarantine, close contacts identified also required quarantine unless they’re vaccinated asymptomatic. students parents reported long lines logistical problems preventing everyone getting tested weekly intended, district said individual schools address. Experts say become clear within months whether program working intended — does, districts take note.

“If half-a-million kids, teachers staff district week, takes away excuse others ‘it’s big, complex, can’t it,’ ” said Andrew Sweet, managing director Rockefeller Foundation’s covid-19 response initiative. “It’s almost like education Marshall Plan specific district.”

L.A. Unified’s approach largely aligns number public health experts recommending months, goes significantly beyond major districts planning. New York City requiring vaccinations school staff, New York City Chicago conducting screening tests portion student body, weekly everyone. Baltimore announced weekly tests high school students, vaccinated students exempted lower grades tested using pooled model results produced classroom group students, individually.

In immediate D.C. region, districts charter schools plan test students staff weekly, including using pooled testing model.

What know school masks, vaccines quarantine rules D.C. area.

One much smaller district Southern California — Culver City — gone L.A. Unified, announcing vaccine mandate eligible students.

California State Superintendent Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said would like see districts follow Culver City’s lead, something L.A. Unified yet contemplating, according Malhotra. Thurmond heaped praise many steps L.A. Unified taking combat virus.

“I see largest district state, second country, taking kinds precautions make sense highest results could hope terms keeping everyone safe,” Thurmond said.

On end spectrum fights taking place Florida Texas, led Republican governors attempting ban school districts issuing mask mandates. states, governors lost court fights issue even coronavirus outbreaks school closures pop over.

For California, aggressive overall response coronavirus, outbreaks happening schools states stand evidence L.A. Unified right track.

“The efforts take money we’re spending well worth keep students school safe environment,” said Robert J. Kim-Farley, professor UCLA Fielding School Public Health.

Kim-Farley others cautioned matter almost certain multiple outbreaks L.A. Unified, given size district spread highly contagious delta variant. hope measures district taking contain outbreak limit number kids forced quarantine.

For students parents Los Angeles, weekly testing mandate welcome relief, providing comfort level confidence schools stay open year-and-a-half kids mostly stuck home navigating remote learning. L.A. Unified’s school body majority Latino, many students lower-income families. Parents need kids school go work. kids happy back school friends, say it’s minor inconvenience get pulled class take quick coronavirus test.

The weekly tests haven’t rolled without controversy questions parents, complained lack transparency district officials. district reports positive tests publicly, initially individual schools, without aggregating figures. local school advocacy group called Parents Supporting Teachers took upon create Excel spreadsheet laying figures, criticizing district themselves.

One leaders Parents Supporting Teachers, Jenna Schwartz, also questioned shifting quarantine protocols district called vaccine mandate eligible students.

“I think LAUSD best safety measures place district country, really do,” said Schwartz, two middle school students. “However doesn’t mean that’s enough … it’s children see still needs happen.”

One Schwartz’s kids, sixth-grader named Oliver attends Walter Reed Middle School, told quarantine toward end second week school proximity student tested positive. Oliver rest Schwartz’s family ultimately tested negative, Oliver said happy way school handled situation.

“I feel like school really good job controlling think overall process good,” Oliver said. said wait 45 minutes hot quarantine tent called class, praised school staff bringing ice water.

Elise Furlan, scientist children L.A. Unified elementary middle schools, questioned whether weekly tests would disrupt learning amount overkill, since it’s impossible eliminate risk catch every infection immediately.

Still, “I think kids it’s important around kids, wear masks, test weekly, it’s okay them,” Furlan said.

Furlan’s fourth-grade daughter, Julianne, said testing give feeling safety, although “It’s kind like annoying every week.” also said tests take “a long time,” defining “about 15 minutes.”

“I say I’m happy part school district right now,” said Andrea Richards, whose daughter fourth-grader public school Silver Lake neighborhood. “I send kid school every morning feel good it.”"" Sorry, referring to?

I also know people think vaccine bad thing hurts people; surprised there're people protesting try convince others take allegedly-harmful thing. so, I'd respect intentions nothing else. Woah, that’s crazy! I’ll look more. Sometimes feel paranoid can’t remember got one (maybe 8 years, perhaps?). would least nice know don’t need paranoid.

- Prevalence variants (Delta v. others). yet. Maybe future vaccines work current variants. There's good reason believe they'll continue working future variants, too.

There variants work *quite well* against, work them.   really need way make synthetic antivenom... needing milk snakes inject non-lethal dose venom animal make antibodies ridiculously inefficient. first one…”they don’t think vaccines work.” new bullshit reason use. breakthroughs, reason. Face it, asshats aren’t going anything greater good. get infected. fine. certain amount fine die. None move needle significant way. 

I tension wishing people would get vaccinated. Everyone come contact virus antibodies one way another. get antibodies easy way hard way. explain Simpson’s Paradox Specially icu full doctors can't run bill ya Nurses' education stops able read monitors use communication device. God love they're generally brightest bulbs begin with, enough knowledge dangerous think educated medicine. They're not. They're educated patient care. hard say. think Q stuff niche group people. widespread. That's say almost like start mass hysteria. People seeing people act nuts instead staying away them, joining them. 

There way many people risking lives reason crazy belief people trying save actually trying kill them. 

It's nuts.  Dayum.  Natural Antibodies count vaccine? “Waiting pandemic”

Good luck that. indoor gatherings it’s “over”? could 5-10 years. File complaint  Thats necessarily true, around much tested negative even yesterday meaning identifiable viral load. grandparents locked room, bottom house. think
you vastly overestimating situation   spread covid whether vaccinated Nobody ever says, yup, guys safe possible honestly going fine.

Nobody scientist medical professional say that, always remaining risk, every small may be. may genetic factors play well.

And personal, non-scientific POV: greatest risk health still delay. People get tested, Delta symptoms unclear, feel could possibly Covid (especially vaccinated); get sick, immediately call doctor, feel ""not sick enough"". People suddenly get worse. getting hospital three days earlier three days later still makes hell difference term severity.

The *true* Covid case numbers US currently 1:100 per week. average entire country. heavily-hit area (Florida, Texas, etc.) numbers far far higher. numbers like reality that, live area, every time leave house go shopping, etc., likely run least one person infected. reality live time being, adjust behaviour accordingly. Quality N95 masks starters, indoors strangers (supermarket, etc.).

---------

And feel exhausted. nothing 100% safe, gain feeling ""relaxedness"" knowing done everything reasonably could stay safe.  said roommates showing symptoms. around them. exposed grandparents. Jesus christ, learned nothing 1.5 years? don’t care get covid long don’t go hospital. really thinking here?

Yes precisely thinking. want lull us false sense security make us think safer actually are.   too. Yup. flu sucks pretty dangerous. basically thing. still want get it.  definitely pick photos intentionally. Uhhhh shooting someone law wouldn’t need mandate that. Twenty, twenty, twenty-four hours go

The booster shot 95% effective infection 97% effective hospitalization. get point vulnerable population received booster shots absolutely need restrictions. need move lives. odds kids catching Covid time vaccine available feels abysmal.

We're fucked. live shit state

Seriously: consider changing that. like emergency happen next 30 years want coherent functional governing response. Holy *fuck* right. one's going patience things prevent flu year. :(

I'm already planning get COVID booster flu shot early October. :( would absolutely go. you’re vaccinated high risk, go enjoy life. You’ll fine. It’s popular opinion here, pandemic ends society says ends, doctors say ends. UK high levels vaccination, cases rising, deaths hospitalization rates per case fraction vaccines. that’s enough reopen society, is? 

The risk level go back pre-crisis quite time, simply going learn live increased baseline deaths new disease least years. can’t keep society state caution fear entire time. long run, number deaths decrease people gain immunity vaccinations infection, that’s going endgame whether keep obsessing meantime. 

But variants! that, I’ll say Delta variant better controlled vaccine developed 18 months ago typical flu strain controlled vaccines developed 4 5 months flu season. If, *if*, vaccine-breaker rises, we’ll make new vaccine, mRNA tech means start making millions doses within weeks. slowly Coronavirus mutates, it’s actually fairly easy stay ahead thing vaccines.

But Long COVID! There’s almost distinction studies “Long COVID” somebody barely breathe months, “Long COVID” someone feels snotty months. Also, people eventually recover even hard time it. Long COVID, cold couldn’t fully shake months. that’s typical “long COVID,” I’m going shut society it, even require people keep taking active measures like masking prevent. Anyone vaccinated sputnik? feel? tried linking article saw. Google C.1.2 South African variant something along lines. Money  can't find article reading earlier one gives good idea new variant. Losers hack military dressing like they're military. wish could confidence, I'm plus staying bit now. bit worried getting COVID something long-term that? Yes. causing hide house? really. believe data Israel suggests 6 months …they could start say, ok everyone got vaxxed March sooner start , won’t , shit show Im starting believe one rapper said covid thing 10 years. Oh yeah, Halloween events holidays come we're fucked. Honestly, I'm cool kids going back school right places infection hospitalization rates high. absolutely want teachers vaccinated there. That's fine. I'd rather ignorant selfish people teaching seems like nice way get rid them. misread entirely friend said thing. There’s medical doc regarding approval states it’s approved 16+. next paragraph goes onto say EUA “revised” “extended”. Even though revisions could something like shelf life vaccine extension kids 12-15, idiot antivaxxers don’t understand medical legalese they’ve interpreted meaning vaccine approved, still EUA. Never mind line paragraph literally says it’s approved. I’m really sad friend fallen misinformation.  point america near completely can't track super spreader events depending is, neglect.

In well managed countries (actually well managed ones cancelled events) minimum tested entry, vaccinated not. required baseline level.

You also tested afterward required follow contact tracing mandatory. seen anywhere US, seems largely trickles self reported illness. People keep going events outdoors miss part shared drinks, rides, long term import/export cases far states, dining, shared split tents hotel rooms among every single person there. 

The US know results event, severely undercounted. contacting ill people things like genomic sequencing figure chain transmission got roughly exist way US. hope 6 months okay make thing. Got plans travel late November (that scheduled big Delta surge 😢) 7 months second dose. Would much peace mind could get booster then. Lockdowns going work certain time. can't keep people homes hotel rooms forever goes away. either destroy economy, kick civil war both.

The key vaccination. Lockdowns always stopgap vaccine developed.  1000% yes I'm saying teachers valuable, I'm saying foolish ignorant anti-vax teachers valuable. Ditto. Man lot anger, think need perspective. 

Okay let ask this, virus mortality rate infection rate Covid happened 1300’s think would infected killed many people? week since last test, would get tested sure since still symptoms. “Hi, um, know you’ve lot week, so, I’ll squeeze ya time infect next week instead lolz”    letting anyone plane vaccinated. Air travel right.   pandemic going end people collectively decide adhere measures, gov/cdc.

That’s going end pandemic… it’ll really hard ignore hospitals overflowing patients putting people tents parking garages running liquid oxygen, etc.

Let's imagine vaccine works half well now, people got end sick. they'd vaccine immunity well natural immunity. people vaccine would prevent infections, people may breakthrough infection. Either way still better taking vaccine, vaccine free costs half hour time coin flip day feeling little tired. soon enough unfortunately. We’ve known going back school full-time months. vaccine available teachers since beginning year. There’s reason waiting 6 weeks school year mandate vaccine teachers Pfizer fully approved.

Helps take though. get COVID self-isolate home recover, matter new strain arises inside I'll spread one. go festival 50,000 people I'm contagious - different story.  teacher, there's scary amount anti-mask/anti-vaxx opinions among us. Like, maybe 40% former school (left last year 5 years) vaccinated

Ediy: North Dakota, disappointing rather surprise. reason Ebola didn’t spread people became sick infect people people scared it. 

Over 600,000 people died America people still refuse something basic wearing mask. lot people still don’t believe even exists, let alone willing get vaccinated. 

The difference could prevented acted better didn’t. We’re incredibly lucky mortality rate low.

Regarding last question, one care makes intuitive sense.

Children dont live beaches, hotels, pools, boat rides, ocean.

If there, exposed parents wrong. NOTHING responsibilities. (Same goes parents said children places, vaccinated not, responsibility mine) depends lot factors; ventilation, distancing, masking possible, percentage clients vaccinated. feel comfortable mine. You’ll want make risk analysis yours. Staff happy answer questions policies whether they’ve looked ventilation. Vaccine requirements masks. No, end? vaccines what? life watching TV now?

My understanding is, time, one sufficient data understand risk long Covid following breakthrough case.

My district Illinois, (obviously Florida) x% cases/contacts single classroom grade level moves remote two weeks. rules last spring apply. Vaccines good again? everything right; diligently wear masks, sanitize everything, wear gloves grocery store, pulled kids school sports, cancelled vacations, didn’t go family funerals etc…. got vaccinated second could. better judgment, sent kids back school. 3 days school entire family sick Covid. Wife fully vaccinated yet sicker we’ve ever been. Seriously wtf? think order probably matters important degree. first exposed virus creates broader immune response, anything boosts response boost broader response. vaccinated first catch virus, might boost narrow response, especially narrow response easily able fight virus. important thing remember narrow response enough, *the immune system broaden response* damage done breakthrough infection far lower. 

So, think people infected virus first vaccinated later strongest resistance new variants. However, *costs* becoming infected naive huge. Yes, get nice broad response, could also die get injured process. Getting vaccinated first might mean vulnerable infection new variants future, costs like costs catching common cold.

In sum, getting infected first probably means get strong/broad immunity quickly, costs immunity bodily damage, risk permanent disability, risk death. Getting vaccinated first may indeed mean broad immunity builds slowly time, also means get pandemic without ever experiencing anything worse cold. Bodily damage breakthrough superficial trivial, risk disability infinitesimal, risk death infinitesimal. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I’m parent, nervously watching MN one vaxed kid due start school week. Would like keep tabs schools employing ageless I’ve mitigation measures. listen play ark, understand mutations isnt color change theres mutation. Yeah no, pandemic isn’t ending time soon Let’s say „incentive“ vaccinated rather „penalty” unvaccinated. tests cheap, paid tax payers cannot go forever like this. future tests paid unvaccinated. virus never go away unless worldwide lockdown time several month. going happen, going live forever getting much people vaccinated possible moving best thing opinion. Yes, 820 deaths, 15,000; bear-normal life rest time, NSW let get control. OK. kind get that. feel like busy pressure get order done fast possible. I've switched using mobile app, taking time order, sitting parking lot til bring out. found way less stressful. comment completely utterly wrong, fairly stupid.

If can't see increasing number people infected say, festival, increases chances mutation, give tbh Covid far less caring. article title bit misleading, imho. judge revoked *visitation* gets vaxxed. No, super overrated put pedestal odd reason. criteria super-spreader event though? first major recorded outbreak Wuhan itself, I’m aware single event particular. shortage events rest world time think circulating months prior noticed initially. 

I get mass gatherings best opportunity creating hotspots social distancing/isolation policies place. But, easily spreads person person, don’t see could possibly circulate multiple countries months without encountering super-spreader event November/December 2019. controversial reasons:

1. FDA approval 18s still emergency use authorisation
2. risk severe complications Covid far lower children adults. risks similar order magnitude vaccine (although data indicates still lower risk)
3. data long Covid children limited. Certainly data suggests far lower prevalence adults longer period time might dissimilar lasting symptoms illnesses

IMO children _should_ get vaccinated they're safer protect others around them. think vaccine mandate probably appropriate yet given limited benefit children around school (compared diseases get vaccinated like MMR Meningitis present far serious danger children). offering antibody titers unvaccinated people see neutralizing antibodies.

This $150 test requires blood draw measures one aspect immunity SARS-CoV-2.

This viable solution scale willing population, seems unlikely acceptable people lean antivax. vaccinated yes. vaccinated Spread whom? Adults get vaccinated high risk.

Vaccinated kids protect kids, protect fragile mental condition adults around them.

It's make feel better, cost masking kids, even discussed mainstream Dr. Douche ilk, matter adults feel better kids vaccinated.

Bunch cowards. know would say they're ""thriving"" right now. one lately? lines least 30 cars deep every minute they're open they're slower ever. pandemic absolutely affected service quality. course that's understandable, think wrong describe ""thriving"" right now. Lol silly. people infected, greater chance variants. 

The people mix, faster rate variants emerging People seem want hate folks want go back getting enjoyment life. public schools already started.

One McD's pass way home 2 line drive thru, menus speaker box. like setup, eat McD's (or fast food) sparingly. penchant Big Macs though. district kid vaccinated never quarantine unless show symptoms.

A reasonable person working old sick people pandemic specifically kills old sick people would get vaccinated. gross deviation reasonable standard care. disagree that?  would immediately start exploring options, try contact school going study concerning refund policies.

Americans equate community neighborly, like saying hello letting borrow drill day. really shallowest definition community.

Because obvious right now? It’s exhausting seeing reports people feigning “omg shock!”

FWIW, pretty surprised hospitals use onsite generation. Apparently mostly hospitals rely deliveries. Australia contacts outside world?

Because they're bigger, international airports, larger economy, trade etc. like asking Germany contacts outside world Iceland.

Of course Australia travel bubble NZ, mean Australia travel bubble non-covid free countries. “left leaning” mean reality leftward bias, yeah sure. terrible. could done person learning much safer choose to. many school districts path. Dude, can't even get adults vax. I'm doubtful letting kids get it.  read differently initially. assumed vaccination status. 

The underlying health issue argument pretty tired, thought fell wayside last summer  ""Ope, sorry, gonna squeeze right ya there, hon!"" Beane gear cheap. What's end goal?

Not risk ""overwhelming hospitals.""

That's always important factor restrictions. thought spring vaccines administered mass cases dropping. concern getting vaccinated, looked like big deal COVID would slow-churn folks we'd continue slowly vaccinate hold-outs.

Then saw Delta elsewhere realized roll without continued protections we'd overwhelm hospitals. states push they're calling National Guard, requesting various levels federal assistance, contracting state nurses, cancelling/delaying elective surgeries myriad ""emergency"" ""surge"" levels support.

I want shit happening state probably time drop protections. I'm cool kid wearing mask school. wish they'd mandate vaccines teachers. I'm going indoors fast food chain eat. locked inside house? No. There's balance. Took kids see Paw Patrol yesterday theatres blast. went nice restaurant days ago. I'm going holds barred full back everything 0 protections. Cops getting vaccinated huge problem nationwide. Covid was/is leading cause deaths cops it’s still enough convince them. sub posted story every dead cops funeral would overwhelmed. Poured Coke cup put lid on. Good job.  probably counting people got vaccinated outside city. That’s problem city’s data. Around 25% people vaccinated outside city, don’t demographic data people. CDC total number residents, detailed information. looks like 50% white Latino residents vaccinated, reality it’s closer 80%. disagree, certainly think justify keeping visitation. guess matter opinion.  I'm wondering happened 'test trace'? enough tests first, plenty. tracing, even attempt anymore.  Google Apple going roll contact tracing apps, privacy concerns seemed crush idea.  think McDonald's pushing app hard (giving discounts, bonuses, etc.). They're preparing future stores like describe (all?) orders made app. could eliminate front line staff would food prep. may speculative, long term, automation could eliminate much that, well. Wish could get back Canada. Samoa, single ship brought flu New Zealand, born. Pacific Islands cultures physical greetings, etc important part live, poor education back then, hard getting message ways protect everyone careful. sister visited 90s, shown several graveyards people died pf SF. vaccines popular countries? Seem like continued model moronity trope me. See happens control income see disparity vaccination rates much based class race. people actually got vaccine bad. Oh great, can't wait mass protests. So? Last year's flu season well recent years averages. enough people get flu vaccines + mask indoors, probably bad. course, things different winter we'll see. Absolutely.  10/hr isnt much labor costs. 

15/hr minimum. Cant handle it? stay market. kid, vaccine days they'd march us gym. great fun, everybody showed tough crying, got cool bandaids. learned anymore schools many issues, everyone time clinic. bizarre people grew marched gym become autistic parents kids letting vaccines. ive known people worked target experience, although im sure varies person person. 

what describing happen, exclusive target walmart. many hourly employers whatever keep ""full-time"" threshold, said that, many paying $15 hour target offers (in area). Go on....  shouldn’t willingly expose kids virus one tell child respond.

We know children low risk covid 19. every age group amount risk children had, single lockdown. claims doctor advised get vaccine. would love see judge ask doctor come forward verify claim. I’m certain she’s lying.

Certain people take vaccine might one people. even lying, still justify allowing visit child. Given much production ramped immunity wanes enough lead non-trivial amount cases, I've started believe booster dose part regimen per se even believe real. think hospitals paid lie this, really full covid patients.

I'd like say people saying fringe looneys work couple them. Data engineers less. 


If invited experience life ICU, they'd say ""these actors"". rabbit hole never ends conspiracy thinking. So? Israel shows 2.6% breakthrough rate, 97.4% lower 100%. second point stands regardless breakthrough rate. Also, we're Israel. Sounds like answer shutdown everything forever, rather require vaccinations go inside anywhere. agree true. sure read previous reply? thing ""staffing shortage"" trying buy labor cheaper labor costs. ""The queen mother dirty words"" Ffp3 masks jumping anticipation... contact tracing follows proper guidelines probably 3-6 students qaurintined every case. He's wrong. vaxxed shows worker neglected take even basic steps keep place safe (to piggyback response now)  hospitals overflowing cases run beds. patients hallways units ER run electrical sockets. Staff short everywhere, even patients floor. People dying developing permanent issues waiting hours treatment can’t get seen staff.

Indoor congregations without masks fucking us People also miss fact people aren’t precipice dying even overweight. makes harder fight virus, yes, way many people seem want go “oh, fat” though person going die soon anyway wasn’t brought virus. Thanks. rate vaccine administration even tick since last Monday approval granted. anyone thought exercise moving goalposts fooling themselves. Yup I'm literately one them. Dont care. Going 3 weeks.

I quarantined year months waiting vaccine, whats right. Im done giving shit people wont get vaccine. greatest moment human evolution generations. Finally something weed stupid species even bigger viral threat hits nation.

Each one dies 1 less person Vote stupid, act stupid, spread inevitable next pandemic. 

As people cant get vaccine, Well stay inside, sucks entire world isnt going go hold 0.0015% population. CDC ACIP meeting materials todays meeting: agenda around reconfirming recommendations Pfizer moved EUA approval, see slide 49 projected timeline booster recommendations.

My 60-second read: presenter skeptical boosters lower-risk individuals wants data safety effectiveness boosters general population. McDonald’s near never re-opened dining area anyway. 40million US population infected total population 328 million.  Assuming many people may infected known, let's say 100million people exposed.

That leaves 230 million people still risk. NYC, urban area highly educated rural areas, presumably better access vaccine information (but also misinformation suppose). Yeah I'm really confused? possibly say controversial?

He's vaccinated, he's careful, he's ok indoor dining. Like, that's mainstream view country. Completely locking country point vaccines extreme anti-vax crazies. Vaccines 100% protect virus, also extraordinary job toning severity virus way do. *gasps last breath*  schools area (Deep South) started two weeks ago.  father works school system access positive case numbers (bastard administration withholds one), access quarantine due exposure. went something like this:

* Day 6, 1300 quarantined

* Day 10, 5800 quarantined

Just numbers seen reported Ontario Canada...seems like approx daily unvaccinated making 75% new cases around 77-83% hospitalization/ICU #'s...I also would bet double vaccinated break cases hospital/ICU older underlying condition.

We beat need vaccines places like India, Brazil etc big population low vaccine rate avoid new variant mess us up. 100k ""by December""... threshold limit Genuine question. went 0.2% 2% two months. people saying potential replace Delta strain. think it? mean 0.2% 2% big leap considering Delta dominant strain SA.

I don’t know provinces. Good wife going honeymoon wedding August 2020. postponed 2021. postponed indefinitely. Lifeeeeboyyyyu Shortages area, lot fast food places moved drive thru it. Means restaurant still run shortstaffed. Seen one two well they've straight closed hours things. Like fuck pay people better maybe this. literally leave Greece Thursday lol want Christmas get kids vaccinated Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes; VAERS self-reported. One person even went said Covid vaccine turned Incredible Hulk. I’m kidding. state this? 23 2.8 million doses? Seems small, wonder % myocarditis COVID There's two McDonald's within 10 min other, opened decades since moved here. one without drive thru closed now.

There's always homeless lurking around dining areas parking lot locations, drive thru option always safer. Lots people going test positive yes fully vaccinated low rate hospitalizations much lower rate deaths. 

Do people really think we're going totally wipe virus out? going happen. always new variant going around (kind like flu every year).

We need get almost everyone vaccinated add virus list ones need keep eye on. solution simple. De-prioritize unvaccinated covid patients hospitals, especially hospital close full. Mandating masks vaccinated people shuttering businesses simply way go. I've watched McDonald's near slowly creep starting wages month-over-month. Started 11 crew we're 13 now. Managers 13 15.

Still enough people given moment run place seems like they're turning people left right. friend went thing Target early pandemic. Guess called multiple times offering old job back plenty hours... ""Nobody wants work anymore""  small number, recovered. 

Covid-19 disease also causes myocarditis, one study (not peer-reviewed) suggests young men 6x likely develop myocarditis Covid vaccine. 

It’s whether vaccine zero risk, it’s whether risk less Covid disease. 100% best evidence far says Covid riskier, far, vaccine. It’s even close.  Would lead unvaccinated cases &amp; variants? amount people Reddit conflate restrictions immunity astounding. lockdown delta makes sense unless trying buy time vaccines… already had. People weren’t taking them. lockdown would end people didn’t get vaccinated catch then. states laws regarding constrictive dismissal address situations like Plenty tests around $20.

OTC tests $40.

I'm guessing insurance paid nowhere near $300.  right here.
At Target used work at, managers got $30,000 bonus kept everyone’s hours certain threshold. keep mind describes 20 known cases 2.8 MILLION vaccinations military members. guarantee 20 service men &amp; women injured killed auto accidents past year.  One fifth vaccinated Iceland got Janssen 1-shot vaccination. half fully vaccinated people got hospitalized Iceland, hence entire group getting mRNA boosters. i'm manhattan asked every time! Sure, Delta exception proves rule. vast majority mutations get outcompeted, especially Delta now. It’s good keep eye out, there’s really anything different regular people doing, news organizations definitely fear mongering every single new variant gets discovered. 

 ...though article fail say it's

It’s interesting. don’t think judge “nut job” judges nation incorporating vaccines judgements incentives, however, teeters overreach, definitely toeing line, opinion.

Late last month, researchers Israel released alarming new Covid-19 data. data showed many Israelis among first receive vaccine nonetheless catching Covid virus. Israelis vaccinated later getting infected often.

The study led headlines around world waning immunity — idea vaccines lose effectiveness time. U.S., Israeli study accelerated debate vaccine booster shots played role Biden administration’s recent recommendation Americans receive booster shot eight months second dose.

But real story waning immunity complex initial headlines suggested. scientists believe Israeli data misleading U.S. policy booster shots gotten ahead facts. evidence waning immunity murky, scientists say, booster shots may big effect.

After returning August break last week, spent time reaching scientists ask help understanding current, confusing stage pandemic. worried vaccinated people Delta variant? much risk children face? parts Covid story overhyped, deserve attention?

I trying answer questions coming weeks. (I’d also like know questions want answered; submit here.)

One main messages I’m hearing experts conventional wisdom waning immunity problematic. Yes, immunity Covid vaccines wane point. may yet waned meaningful way.

“There’s big difference needing another shot every six months versus every five years,” Dr. David Dowdy, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University, told me. “So far, looking data have, I’m seeing much evidence we’ve reached point yet.”

Simpson strikes again

At first glance, Israeli data seems straightforward: People vaccinated winter likely contract virus summer people vaccinated spring.

Yet would truly proof waning immunity two groups — winter spring vaccine recipients — otherwise similar other. not, differences might real reason gap Covid rates.

As turns out, two groups different. first Israelis received vaccine tended affluent educated. coincidence, groups later among first exposed Delta variant, perhaps likely travel. higher infection rate may stemmed new risks taking, change vaccine protection.

Statisticians name possibility — topline statistics point false conclusion disappears examine subgroups. It’s called Simpson’s Paradox.

This paradox may also explain U.S. data C.D.C. cited justify booster shots. Many Americans began resume indoor activities spring. getting Covid may reflect newfound Covid exposure (as well arrival Delta), rather waning immunity time.

‘Where it?’

Sure enough, data supports notion vaccine immunity waning much.

The ratio positive Covid tests among older adults children, example, seem changing, Dowdy notes. waning immunity major problem, expect see faster rise Covid cases among older people (who among first receive shots). even Israeli analysis showed vaccines continued prevent serious Covid illness essentially rate before.

“If there’s data proving need boosters, it?” Zeynep Tufekci, sociologist Times columnist, written.

Part problem waning-immunity story line irresistible many people. vaccine makers — Pfizer, Moderna others — incentive promote it, booster shots bring big profits. C.D.C. F.D.A., part, history extreme caution, even harms public health. media tend suffer bad-news bias. many Americans understandably frightened Covid pay attention alarming signs reassuring ones.

The bottom line

Here’s best attempt give objective summary evidence, free alarmism — acknowledging uncertainty:

Immunity probably wane modestly within first year receiving shot. reason, booster shots make sense vulnerable people, many experts believe. Dr. Céline Gounder Bellevue Hospital Center told colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, C.D.C.’s data “support giving additional doses vaccine highly immunocompromised persons nursing home residents, general public.”

The current booster shots may little good people. vaccines continue provide excellent protection illness (as opposed merely positive Covid test). People eventually need boosters, may make sense wait one specifically designed combat variant. “We don’t know whether non-Delta booster would improve protection Delta,” Dr. Aaron Richterman University Pennsylvania told me.

A national policy frequent booster shots significant costs, financially otherwise. Among things, exaggerated discussion waning immunity contributes vaccine skepticism.

While Americans focusing booster shots, policies may much beat back Covid, including vaccine mandates U.S.; rapid push vaccinate world (and prevent variants taking root); accelerated F.D.A. study vaccines children.

As always, open changing minds get new evidence. Richterman puts it, “We time gather appropriate evidence rushing boosters.” They’re poo-pooing doomerism variant lowering cases since July. don’t know half sub *wants* believe everything horrible nothing ever get better.  None us offer medical advice based specific condition, I'd say talk cardiologist.

Mine strongly encouraged get vaxxed (and specifically Pfizer whatever reason), everyone's different. Yet there’s new fucking strain already found yet Africa, also first deer found Covid. 
I really don’t think people realize exactly bad shit is, need stop fucking around try little better get rid damn virus. app useful. protect can't protect themselves? daughter vaccinated. can't yet. 5.

That said, soon that's available, shot time.  mention that's taxes like 22-24,000 year nothing. Lol expect US govt force ppl take it? Good luck cause massive uproar, may cause civil war, many idiots think it’s even authoritarian currently  Vaccine stop spread...just stops dying... People immune issues advised get vaccine physicians. entirely work home anyway. makes sense. vaccines gives antibodies target spike protein. Real infection give immunity proteins.

As far know, live-virus still gold standard vaccination triggers stuff real deal. think outrageous wonder it. 

I said never get anything resembling firm answer question could dare predict characteristics next variant concern going existing immunological responses going handle it? know, fluke nature, future variants may *more* readily neutralized mRNA vaccine-induced response convalescence. knows?

It's complete unknown. guess. ponder it. purposeful reinfection - known risk - seems like ridiculous price unknown return. rules says show proof vaccination sure card enough wish faster, too, imagine nightmare would turned vax caused problems kids. would double antivaxxers overnight. would rather super careful. bigger issue states like mine (Texas) going way avoid precautions. I'm guessing winter great either.   McDonald's open 2pm-10pm indoor seating.  can’t use photo? could well blaming, questions people asked. could well wanting reassurance? 

I think explicit train thought: ""He's young, died this. I'm young, die this. different? difference make safe?"" think goes extent. 

Even, like mentioned, example lung cancer smoking. guy smoked, don't, maybe forget might die cancer someday also? really makes wonder 3% it? Can't blame unvaccinated here. negative test. guess blame? guessed it. answer no? 21% fully vaccinated / 42% partly vaccinated???

You literally throwing away right think anything dystopian Kid Rock show Sturgis Covid ripping unvaccinated? Lord hope so. want over. (Disclaimer: following general simplified ease understanding. highly recommend [this technical, though also easy understand overview concepts.)

Remember purpose antibodies are: they're ""front line"" adaptive immune response. Very, generally speaking, objective prevent infection. prevent virus even gaining foothold body.

But data have, *both* vaccine-conferred immunity convalescent immunity, seems point inexorable fact antibody immunity wanes time.  matter what, seems, antibody protection infection going decrease time.

But mean get sick die whenever antibodies fail prevent infection. Vaccination convalescence ALSO train lymphocytes adaptive immune system: T-Cells, B-Cells, memory cells, etc. detect mount response. generally kick antibodies fail prevent infection. Putting simply, cells come help ""clean up"" virus already taken foothold body, prevent virus making seriously ill killing you. may even prevent ever experiencing single symptom.

So mind, let's revisit question: purpose serve person infect purpose? Remember, whole *point* enhancing antibody response prevent *infection*. Purposeful infection therefore innately counterintuitive.

Secondly, *know* convalescence superior vaccine immunity comes training *other* memory/T/B cell ""clean up"" crew jobs.  Sounds like confounding factors, least men.

Many comorbidities significant risk factors severe COVID-19 also tend cause related low sex hormones, low-testosterone specifically. Diabetes, smoking, NAFLD, etc. *choose enough employees Fast food workers interface customers sounds like dream me. school facing pressure student body implement vaccine mandate fall. sent email today students provide either proof vaccination negative test arriving campus, everyone isn’t vaccinated take weekly test. wish wouldn’t leave option opt already thought would cave honestly Thank fully agree.

I'm certain judge make medical decisions CDC guidelines currently recommend people wait get MRNA vaccines (such Pfizer moderna) episode myocarditis resolved. able reduce risk lot (masking, etc) next office visit perhaps next office visit myocarditis resolved.

If resolved, discussion really need cardiologist risk getting covid unvaccinated versus getting covid vaccine, could potentially risk myocarditis less possible side effects getting covid vaccinated, covid likely cause problems myocarditis vaccine.

➡️31 COVID-related hospitalizations (Statewide Total: 807) 
➡️0 COVID-related deaths (Statewide Total: 36)

For reference, NJ 61% fully vaccinated. well established country, people care money allergies taxation anyone anything else. know immigrants chose leaders cause thought they'd get pay less taxes, that's care about. obvious issue.
btw, said concern. Yup, nothing convince worry new variant now. It’s lesson learned Delta - brushed off, wreak havoc summer. one knows next delta-esque variant be, know everyone probably brush realize it’s serious, it’s late. happened original covid too; nobody really worried March 2020 late. agree. live Vancouver island still find expensive! How? scientific community showing Delta virulent. children, vaccinated, shelved travel plans foreseeable future. ""punished""? punishments doled out, cancelling postponing vacation?

I wouldn’t recommend coming though simply tourism incredibly understaffed overpriced moment. quality service horrendous please patient. hope vaccine mandates happen fast *all* school children. like it? Homeschooling filthy little brats. percentage people wear masks vs wear masks? Yes, way understand it.  good presentation conclusion basically (my interpretation) boosters used reduce chance severe illness (not mild illness) high risk groups (not everyone). point solutions going solved Labor Day everyone back school. need solution now. one. vax mandate make issues worse. Even less teachers means classes need consolidation virus spread much quickly. keep saying, one coming solution work now. Hence no-win situation. Yeah. gig work side see restaurant workers. Many super nice too. tried convince one guy HS join navy air force. said thought it, likes job much. went back mopping floor. current technology. It’s affordable one going repeatedly give blood understand antibody levels. kicker information even particularly valuable controlling COVID19. 

You’d better spending money cheap, daily antigen testing. would actually helpful logistically plausible.  Wow, help make vaccine?? Shh let Reddit circle jerk moment.

Would need exception babies too.  point actually sounds good live dormitory provided employer. Rent prices absolutely control there's way build wealth rent costs 50% income workers. 

Taco Bell could buy apartments employees. would good sign bonus.  people smart enough get it, read comments provide non paywall solutions - \- maybe spend less time complaining time learning  testament sheer incompetency McDonald's, keep track former pay scales leave old signs landscaping along new ones.

And yes, restaurant industry US due reckoning while. Damn, really? I'm Toronto first I've heard it. already Uber, Ritual, DoorDash, Skip, used Foodora folded. in-store app? kinda live rock, that's common far I'm aware.  really really gotta watch film Sorry Bother You. good. gets weird fuck towards end too, great
 
But literally idea it. kind fictionalised billionaire that's definitely Jeff Bezos Mark Zuckerberg type, literally turns prisons homes, advertises hipster dormitories, they're employees. literally none employees actually afford live real home. blunt much try make look like prisons, too
 
Also billionaire played noted real life actual cannibal Armie Hammer, adds even whole message going really, meta way choice have, cancel, half band unable play due COVID? But, likewise, evidence reason believe boosters cause harm first two doses didn't? let people get them. Let pay pocket them. we're throwing away, not? winning here, people upset matter what. going greatly accelerate dumbing process.  vast majority covid transmissions Hawaii unvaxxed locals hanging together, tourists. it’s vaccinated filling hospital beds.

I trip planned September in-laws, never travel going Hawaii BIG deal. We’re vaccinated healthy, It’s outdoor destination, I’m worried.  Staffing shortages closed dining rooms fast food places. one wants work. Ok sympathy affording rent there's vaccine widely available 6 months millions never able stop working essential workers begin with. there's 8 million job openings right now. supposed move Tampa PA right started job offer. I'm glad declined. Sounds right.

Step one: unlist phone number. Panda express near hiring sign front, amusing keep pasting another number onto second digit, first 10, 11, 12, 13. span months. hope current employees asking raises every time paste new digit there. 

It's great time ask raise restaurant industry. probably get it. cuts risk half ""twice good"". 27x good would like 99.7%. ""Times effective"" confusing since effectiveness 1-risk risk matters. research term usually ""relative risk"" aka RR OR.

Those differences matter lot, even talking herd immunity thresholds. Yeah, see flaw that?

This already happens little - people run school boards good, altruistic reasons.

Many run weird axe grind, like power, see steppingstone politics. Grand Rapids court big difference legislation, appeal court decision, applies individual blanket group. indoor seating little annoying.

But closing bathrooms annoying. Traveling COVID resulted dumping load behind bush along highway once. door dash driver waited 20 minutes line, ordered, sat eat co-worker ordered phone 30 minutes left still waiting food. That's city Chipotle need code bathrooms lights dark blue (so can't find vein).

I've also walked in, ordered, left people ""in line"" togo.

Now suburb Chipolte totally different. Remote order, 100% time time. 

It's amazing much differs restart restaurant. Extra shots short intervals nothing. Wait 6 (5-12) months get single booster.   Long-term effects permanent effects, though. Long Covid cases keep increasing indefinitely many also recovering anywhere several weeks year. trying downplay Long Covid, idea large proportion population lifelong symptoms Covid pure clickbait fearmongering.  lot supply J&amp;J. Evading antibodies bit disingenuous time. shown reinfected people earlier alpha strains, Delta mRNA vaccines. Get still can.

Delta changed rules schools simply ignored it. COVID-19 longer COVID-19. coronavirus spreading human population mutating, much like influenza does. viruses do. idea somehow destroy laughable. genie long bottle. best bet seasonal vaccinations therapeutics combat symptoms virus loses effect general population. Yes, immunocompromised people co-morbidity issues extra careful, fairness people always careful, even flu. time, another virus learn live with. stop thinking end come. come. end simply learning live move lives. wife travel nurse making six figures less six months. hospital working re-negotiated contract twice....TWICE even started....to offer money make sure still wants come work there. new york times article define ""The rules"" are, super confusing reporting (NYT one guilty issue).

There universal ""European ban"" US travelers. non-binding European Council recommendation lists countries considered *individual country* part EU. EU make ""The rules"" speak, individual country,.

Some countries accept photo paper USA CDC vaccination card depends individual country's rules. That's salary. salary guarantee payment specific amount weekly, bi- weekly even monthly.

Boosters everyone would 200 million.

It’s pretty incomparable. Boosters general populous takers away first shots world (of donated 115 million). It’s tough call.

Unfortunately, doesn’t look like there’s much choice— question “when” given waiting longer might give longer last immunity (but given numbers, wait?) Literally none us know dying like real, experiences like NDE ego dissolution ""feel"" like dying since one ever died real comeback know things really death like... anyone claims say know death like either putting complete faith chemical experience worse talking completely ass...  According AAP pediatric COVID-19 deaths per week last 2 weeks. fact, 425 total pediatric deaths far pandemic, 67 happened month alone. That's basically 16%

If trend holds another week 1 5 pediatric COVID-19 deaths occurred August 2021 schools 2-3 weeks places others. drove across country back late July/Early August, plenty McDonald's ran (they great breakfast) already drive thru only, possibly due staffing issues. I'm approaching 5-month mark second dose Pfizer. know lot people saying 8 months get booster. I'm sure efficacy 5 months would smart get third jab around 6 months? kids get vaccine, think it’s really going hit fan low vaccine communities. Lol seeing reading US articles kind confusing. zero hospitalizations? What's news here? Thank you! soon can, I’m running get third shot. I’d much rather baby get antibodies without exposed live virus take chance I’m able breastfeed pass antibodies. MSM. anybody else noticed past week there's starting ""stop making fun anti-vaxxers dying!"", ""suggesting vaccinated people receive priority literally eugenics!"", etc. among pandemic enthusiast Twitter? (e.g., zero covid-ers, long covid support groups, etc.) necessarily they're wrong saying that, really fight need picking right now? mess happening people unvaccinated. need trying get shots arms trying moral high ground slandering horse dewormer users. There's literally benefit tone-policing people critical ardent anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, etc. People unvaccinated they're indifferent mildly hesitant different story, said Twitter communities determined undermine CDC, pro-vaxxers support measures, etc. actual blatant misinformation spreaders. point, there's limited amount messaging that's going real meaning people made minds--stop using finite power come defense anti-vaxxers et al.

Like, hope anti-vaxxers see bro. 180 cases last week. number getting larger every day. I’m really frustrated masks political.  judge (James Shapiro) reversed order today say feels overreach, provided proof risk getting vaccinated like said, public criticism, reason was. Something changed roughly 48 hours, hopefully unusual error (rather part broader history questionable holdings behavior, others demonstrated many 10,000 cases led symptoms, illnesses? That's state already made form Vaccine passport identification illegal.  theyre qualified nurse naturally assume experts anything health related. sad. Sonic drive-**in** addition drive-thru.

Drive-in labor intensive dining room, since order delivered customers’ cars rather picking counter.

The Sonic kid works begun shutting several stalls day due staff shortages. Many thanks clear concise explanation.

So, vaccine 65% effective, vaccine E 95% effective, relative risk would determined:

(100%-65%) / (100%-95%) 

35% / 5%

7

The relative risk faced folk vaccine would 7-times risk faced folk vaccine E.

I'm sorry. school year going feel impossible kids get vaccinated restrictions starts stops. True enough start somewhere. School session almost 3 weeks news going crazy many new cases are. kids masking yet made requirement. gonna get worse. Glad got shots back March April.  Given prognosis people go ventilators it’s terrifying 2,640 them. don’t know it’s still bad vaguely remember early pandemic something like 60% ventilated people didn’t make it. Hopefully odds improved. I’m denying that. saying it’s conscious decision enforce it. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

My go.

VAERS risk defined number positive cases group 27x right. 

If risk defined reduction risk unvaccinated vaccinated, naive previously infected, first group 16,215 unvaccinated naive people figure many become symptomatic, sure that. could say vaccine reduced 16,215 199 infection reduced 16,215 8 comparing 98.8% 99.9% maybe 27x. big variable know many people exposed kind baseline.

But first approach analogous original trials. Like two groups say 15k people, one vaccinated one not, compare many cases two groups, get 100 10, say vaccine 90% effective, comparing two counts number cases.

But data compelling. Even protection vaccine previous infection equal would big news. Even thy order magnitude protection 2.7x good, still big news. question received enough attention, stage game estimated 20-40% world's population exposed, whether immune long key question drives overall vaccination strategy. people really immune, need double vaccines ""naive"".

Frustratingly, are.

Vaccinated people dying non-COVID causes hospitals overloaded unvaccinated people. x-fold numbers study odds ratios, direct comparisons efficacies like that.

To roughly work reached 27-fold number: 
they group 16,125 vaccinated people, 191 symptomatic breakthrough. group, odds breakthrough would 191 (those getting breakthrough) / 15934 (those getting breakthrough), 0.0119 1.19%. (We could actually calculation probability get essentially results, method use calculates odds let's use too.)

The previously infected group also 16,125 (they matched groups), 8 breakthroughs. odds 8 / 16117, 0.0004 0.04% 

The odds ratio, then, would (191/15934) / (8/16117), 24.1 - odds 24 times higher. exactly 27 reached, model also adjusts comorbidities logistic regression, pretty close.

How would work vaccine immunity efficacy numbers? can't, never-vaccinated-never-infected-group. Maybe vaccine prevented 50% cases natural immunity 98%, maybe vaccine prevented 75% cases natural immunity 99%. consistent odds ratio - even vaccine preventing 90% cases natural immunity preventing 99.5%. know these, infinite options, is.

Immunologists, organizations specialize disease research, understanding, control.

No one I've talked generally supports biden ever made think somehow last word anything policies. idea might (or might think supporters do) disheartening best deeply troubling worst. Man, writing great. example, shouldn’t say “Chinese student,” since said “American student” earlier?  

Is get uninterrupted education? 85%?? non driver blows mind. plans compensate people postpone?

Like bear costs might make including Continental US would caused shift? Funnily enough, San Francisco two weeks ago get vax-carded anywhere. Guess things changed. Portland, though, asked vax card/ID even sit outdoors bar. true. However true everything. Nothing tested long-term. even vaccine. reports diseases also dying / long-term effects well. covid different numbers higher? leading cause death UK anymore (I think even top 10). 

Like everything else sort trade risk benefit. vaccines work live way never go away. Thanks, nice know I'm one uncertainty. feeling confident since got vaxxed never stopped wearing two masks, saw Florida hit 56,000 new cases one day got hit fear again.

They revised entry rules allow vaccinated tourists cases dropped 50 per day, 2-4 people ICU given day. 1 death per day. Pretty good, considering population skews old, obese gregarious. Cases slowly dropping further, I'm sure booster offered soon.

There restrictions: 

* masks indoors everyone 3 years old - high compliance day places like supermarket; much bars 9pm.
* unvaccinated wear masks outdoors. I've seen people I'm sure well enforced.
* limits number people seated events (hundreds).
* standing events allowed ignored (events advertised sit-down everyone dances). 
* think there's still limit max 6 people per restaurant table? ignored.

The new analysis relies database Maccabi Healthcare Services, enrolls 2.5 million Israelis. study, led Tal Patalon Sivan Gazit KSM, system’s research innovation arm, found two analyses never-infected people vaccinated January February were, June, July, first half August, six 13 times likely get infected unvaccinated people previously infected coronavirus. one analysis, comparing 32,000 people health system, risk developing symptomatic COVID-19 27 times higher among vaccinated, risk hospitalization eight times higher. 
 
“The differences huge,” says Thålin, although cautions numbers infections events analyzed comparisons “small.” instance, higher hospitalization rate 32,000-person analysis based eight hospitalizations vaccinated group one previously infected group. 13-fold increased risk infection analysis based 238 infections vaccinated population, less 1.5% 16,000 people, versus 19 reinfections among similar number people SARS-CoV-2.

If wish humor me; harm, foul.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

One thing still bugs relative risk metric, alone, leaves much room interpretation... especially leaks public sphere ignorant folk like abound.

For instance, relative risks 99.9% effective vaccine 99.999% effective vaccine would 100... identical relative risks 99.1% effective vaccine 10% effective vaccine.

Given relative risks values (as case many headlines related study's findings), there's way see difference efficacies, people could jump wild conclusions.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Another thing bugs relative risks metric seems like could lead totally bogus conclusions; example, nominal risk infection 3/100, study compared two interventions, one led 4/100 infections, 2/100 infections, relative risk would say 2/100 intervention twice good 4/100... 2/100 would actually helping... people might choose one harm (if given additional info beyond relative risks).

My guess relative risk studies rarely performed independent studies intervention validated benefit; maybe I'm worrying situation ever arise real world. maybe I'm bracing bogus reports pumped jerk who's trying make quick buck bogus product.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

As far know, symptomatic infection relatively well estimated around 85%. hospitalizations estimated around 5.16%.

It possible compare intervention outcomes naïve outcomes regarding symptomatic infections hospitalizations, believe finer-grained estimates per age-group exist well.

Regarding confounding issues listed; see would relevant previously uninfected unvaxxed folk folk studied bin.

&amp;#x200B;

In end, fault researchers exactly they're supposed do, fault fools like try play couch-epidemiologist studies get misinterpreted.

I suppose want figure best way convert science-speak statements media could use described ways led fewer misunderstandings.  job pre-covid gave 4 hour shifts, sucked wasn’t really worth it. job now, different management, I’m working nearly full time. Funny possible time need people. compare relations cases vs deaths last peak ,they 50% less death time title CDC's words. That's ABC's editorializing. 

One sets numbers get effective 75yo+, 90% based Alpha/WT. We've known Delta worse, causing hospitalization vaccinated unvaccinated. vaccines less effective Delta mean boosters would solve problem: need additional study showing hospitalization decreases booster. 

There really much data effectiveness boosters Delta. We've started getting preliminary data. age groups, 2 doses still pretty effective preventing critical illness. care younger people spread disease immunocompromised/elderly/unvaccinated people produce immune escape variants, position boosters makes sense. 

As long go people decide want third doses places give doses even might strictly fit CDC's criteria, I'm fine decision this. think people need get 3rd doses, there's strong enough evidence CDC able defend decisions critical populous. aim prevent infection since don’t want risk long term effects. goal everyone well long still don’t fully understand long covid. 

If third shot makes much less likely even catch covid, I’m absolutely talking it. That's combination lower efficacy Delta waning, though. waning, point estimate 85% among participants &lt;120 days elapsed since completion full vaccination compared 73% among ≥150 days elapsed; however 95% CI overlapping, indicating difference statistically significant.

I'm sure data matched (is possible older people exposed people got vaccines first?) analysis adjusts confounders, anyway, best say stage might little waning (even though HEROES-RECOVER cohort provide significant data that). worked San Francisco. Honestly don’t think cashier Burger going stringent checking. Kids suppose nations future.

This horrific statistics forget long-term effects.

We're literally creating next generation fog brain dum dums GOP dum dums exception Upper Midwest, US seems peaking plateauing. concerning thing exactly happened last year time--the South's cases fell, Upper Midwest lit September rest US races late fall. Let's hope pattern hold. think ethically discharge dying patient? eyeballing graphs different states locales looks pretty clear peaked almost everywhere US. maybe wave. I'm guessing production capacity limited point EUA would limited benefit. I'm guessing Novavax. Nah, they’re probably taking log real death numbers look smaller 😂 Fort Worth terrible vaccination numbers large city. probably wrong. make appeal complainant dead then. Yep.

There senses relative absolute risk matter. talk hospital capacity absolute numbers concerned about; first factor 2 much important subsequent ones. talking approaching 100% disease prevention relative risk at.

And approach 100% possibility elimination (ala measles) comes back play. infection gets us really close 100% incredibly promising long-term, people future vectors vaccines trying get match it. opened? People using word salary Taco Bell hilarious. salary become synonymous hourly?

Bring downvotes. Theres literally places pay enclosures handle them.

Also documented cases zoo animals catching covid snow leopards, tigers, lions, gorillas. y'all think study came estimating number Americans per state ""long Covid""? fully recognize long CoViD real, devastating, bit skeptical numbers. think 3/10 people infected actually persistent shortness breath, brain fog, etc. would news now. study estimated 900,000 Floridians 1.2 million Californians long COVID. seem add up, especially since friend spent week ICU he's fine now. guys think? rate we're going might well enter another lockdown since idiots understand.   makes feel better health risk kids always small still small even delta variant. article Australia relies heavily US masks public, otherwise socializing friends normally. I'm sure scientific sources follow many non-CDC epidemiologists follow twitter pointing that:

1. Israel data wildly misunderstood misrepresented. focuses anti-body levels infection prevention, never aim vaccines, even still misrepresents numbers.
2. Vaccine effectiveness always measured prevention severe illness, preventing infection. Countries like Iceland Denmark better examples look at, Israel. Iceland Denmark much higher levels vaccination Israel despite experiencing ongoing Delta surges, Iceland averaged 0 deaths months Denmark basically declared pandemic country.
3. media US managed spin aim vaccines away preventing severe illness preventing infection, NEVER aim. antibody counts seen dropping infection vaccinated individuals possible (although still unlikely), media sounding alarm. B-cell T-cell responses remain strong protection severe illness robust ever. Hospitals overrun result people refusing get vaccinated.
4. Therefore, giving vaccinated people boosters seem much priority whole world struggling get vaccinated. longer countries places like Africa can't get access vaccines, likely concerning variants could arise. Instead boosting people proven still protected every traditional level-headed measure vaccine effectiveness, focusing vaccinating rest world. Smart Sure employer moment, 330 million+ country.

It something talk about. severe allergic reaction component vaccine- case almost always get different vaccine. everything allowed. Masks come back maybe 10% retail places. Still going bars, restaurants, name it. vaccinated since June. don’t understand Tennessee investigation. reason governor’s opt-out order hasn’t challenged several school districts spoke lawyers determined order illegal. governor knows well. pretty clearly defined state law. New Orleans was, Ida Lambda already this. Vaccine resistance much better variant. hasn’t able gain much traction Delta’s insane transmissibility basically cockblocked it’s ability spread. humanist are!

But you’re humanist advocating refuse get vaccinated killed? put “culled”?

You’re sick.   sure unreasonable. vaccinated puts kid, ex-husband, everyone else risk. Ok, data show safe genpop? Yes? deploy it. plenty vaccines manufacturing keep still exporting countries, unless reason believe actually harmful, matter? nothing new. already go school. whole ""we can't force people vaccinate"" bullshit. We've decades.  would surprised. ""Adverse reactions"" vaccine common, almost everyone side effects. said ""severe allergic reactions"" might little convincing. Even better would actual note doctor accountable, rather saying ""my doctor told so"". sounds like someone trying avoid vaccine. good masking classroom/bus lunch always challenge. 

Millions parents going exact scenario right now. Obviously, there's risk involved determine tolerance. makes feel better, risk severe outcomes kids super low risk vaccinated parents. I'm COVID hotspot right we've school 3 weeks. cases I'm aware of, kids got COVID minor case vaccinated parents never contracted it. We're supposed going first week November....ugh It’s uncommon hire stand-in musicians, could probably done wanted forge ahead costs. $10 Orlando equivalent $15 looks it.  Nobody able hire less $18. yeah guys definitely well. I'm expert I'm guessing social safety net putting well needed upward pressure wages Florida sounds like guys everything possible employers little possible employees. That's rough. guys also another strike limited Medicaid help low wage workers. help pretty much everyone making less $78k daycare healthcare. generation onsite, they'd run O2 long time ago.
