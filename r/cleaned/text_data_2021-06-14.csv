0,2021-06-14," Here's kicker, conceived weeks recovering. recipe conspiracy confirmation. Good I'm worried slow burn right wildfire holiday season like last year.

And last year summer hit southern states hard cause retreat inside, unlike winter elsewhere. Time tell. rose 3 days later. kind defeats point. die something probably stay dead, defeats purpose otherwise. find irrational idiotic, personally. know article posted couple times already. Ok, troll, answer this:

Is including natural immunity (i.e. 95.5% people die) part immunity vaccines proper? Im skeptical plus environment people working home choosing live even spatially secluded lives result. person living exurb drive every single trip make, also drive longer distances things. may commute, trips longer car dominated. doesnt even take account potential low density residential pressure could cause leading farm fields, forests, wetlands prairies torn green lawns homes.

Additionally, many may taken transit work before, likely drive still lingering fear covid. Traffic city looks bad pre-covid fraction downtown workforce back far. see real positive environmentally speaking. here. Also used habit checking Texas Med Center page every morning 930 see updates. week stuff nice really liked seeing daily metrics. Ok agent million one vs. helplessly face 3%? 

I get saying end day still bad math. disagree except kids choice. known risk actual infection original strain yes. 

The long covid children not. new variants hit young people including children much harder, much. 

Kids given ton keep adults safe. even mask couple months. gross.  agree bad faith arguments conspiracy theories place public discourse; they‚Äôre bad actors everywhere ls reason anything.

People short term memories. Trump president Democrats saying wouldn‚Äôt trust vaccine put administration. Duh...  So, let get straight: 45 deserves credit vaccines, going take vaccine they're dangerous? don‚Äôt Universal Orlando. went one day getting yelled didn‚Äôt free all. Weird. How's 5G reception, though?
/s Whats 'but wait, yet' articles lately? countries small populations also higher vaccination rates. Canada simply #1 among countries population 1M. Ooh, subreddit flair. course. No, stupid comment. something like 99.7% men vs 99.75% women survive Covid infection. very, close number.

The real reason women prone autoimmune conditions general, long Covid seems permanent immune overreaction lasts long time. Yeah, it‚Äôs really tough seeing like that. knew great grandparents childhood. great grandmother got dementia 15. lived years it, honestly good years her. time died everyone family already grieved loss. would little less heartbreaking see go natural causes year two earlier. [Forwarding WOULD GUESSED Im trolling all. 

You continue deliberately misinterpret data refuse acknowledge facts.

Again,

If virus mortality rate 1%. 

You vaccine protects infection 90%. 

What vaccinated persons mortality rate exposed virus?

Prove math. I‚Äôm serious.  Nope. scary-new-variant-du-jour kind got old couple months ago. one proves majorly evade vaccines - seems unlikely near future - I‚Äôm overly worried. I‚Äôm hoping aren‚Äôt knee jerk restrictions imposed. Also people wash hands stand six feet apart also lower infection rates. almost like scientists know talking mobile app main subreddit menu, top right, 3 dots, change flair.

On site, page, right side menu. fuck's sake, troll. deliberately trying mislead people, including natural immunity vaccine claiming protection vaccine.  liar. propagandist. disgusting. need this, vaccines great. need lie them. 

Blocking moving on. Whoa, whoa, whoa. get crazy insane amount donating!

-_- get flair? Pfizer better AZ first place? distrust criticism vaccines doesn‚Äôt stop vaccines aren‚Äôt ‚Äúfully vetted‚Äù. find similar arguments used vaccines whole, even ones we‚Äôve used decades. lot criticisms see unfounded insane too. ones saying can‚Äôt critical aren‚Äôt risks aren‚Äôt exceptions looking arguments people made concern covid vaccine id say lot go well beyond skepticism lot aren‚Äôt good faith. see uncritical conspiracy level thinking think it‚Äôs fair call out. Sure one vaccinated. Llorente chance? tested negative multiple times following days deemed false positive let back join spain squad.  Might be, doubt theres individuals cases.  people don‚Äôt die virus. You‚Äôre right! 99.5% according CDC. 

The vaccine trials follow studies show mRNA vaccines prevent infection 91% people COMPARED unvaccinated individuals.

What happens take away least 91% 0.5% people would succumb virus? ignoring benefit partial protection. 

Run truth. ""vast vast."" can't help want it. Newsom said would issue executive order put new mask rules heard Cal/OSHA 17th effect immediately.    Wrong   mean it‚Äôs free. not?   asked FDA committee split answered split thought. firmly believe approved vaccinating many children ages 2to 11 possible right now. attributing natural immunity vaccine. dishonest. 

Most people die virus, using vaccine efficacy. dishonest.

Stop it. Jesus, stop lying, please. vaccines great own, lie them. Stop lying, PLEASE! TLDR: got enough vaccines injected first doses. news, sun really hot. Long covid scarred lungs, permanent activation immune system wreaks havoc body. Happens viruses well.  That‚Äôs cognitive dissonance high level. There‚Äôs misleading. Math science don‚Äôt care feelings. 

Again.

1% morbidity exposed virus. 
90% vaccine efficacy infection. 

What morbidity rate vaccinated individual?

If can‚Äôt answer that, you‚Äôre intellectually dishonest. post California neither. study addresses efficacy natural immunity period studied. Regardless reason, case counts dropping. mother never vaccinated six kids, was, vaccinate us. eventually got shots, ffs mom.

We lost two family members friend Covid. Guess got vaccine?? 

Worst part is, mom know better. registered nurse, worked biotech company, tutors calculus.. engineering work. smartest misguided person know. 

Fuuuuuuun fact: got anti-vaxx shit mail lady 80's. parents never moved see around parts lot. always wonder illegal post person hand personal pamphlets. Jesus dead care either way? virus less lethal vending machine 12.

It‚Äôs serious risk them. wont calling, also texting, emailing, know address, visiting place residence SHOCK *Fourteen days receiving second dose, researchers found Pfizer 92 per cent effective Alpha variant first identified U.K. 79 per cent effective Delta variant, first identified India. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca vaccine provided 73 per cent protection Alpha variant 60 per cent Delta variant.*

*After 28 days post-vaccination, said ‚Äúonly really‚Äù difference protection ‚Äúof 18 per cent‚Äù AstraZeneca vaccine, ‚Äúwhich great.‚Äù*

*The data also suggests risk hospitalization among infected Delta variant double Alpha variant, especially respondents five severe medical comorbidities.*

*Researchers found two doses AstraZeneca Pfizer vaccines effective reducing hospitalizations among people contracted Delta strain, effectiveness shots ‚Äúdiminished‚Äù compared Alpha variant.* Try kill somebody else way down!

I jest, people really killed suicidal people jumping. watched Benfica's Mikl√≥s Feh√©r die pitch live. Boggles mind still places asinine restrictions. even California opened know you‚Äôre something wrong.  sub find sky blue grass green? Pretty sure everyone /r/nova complaining Fairfax's rollout. mean good, though. Again, trying mislead people. trying use natural immunity (most people die from. Covid) attribute vaccine.

You LYING people here. Stop it. better that. honest, please honest. it‚Äôs Wapo must deep state. ü§£üòè watch DSHS website daily wondered headline. Glad someone else noticed discrepancy. It‚Äôs mainly dumb obese admins see sitting behind desks, actual doctors. Answer question. 

1% morbidity. 
90% vaccine efficacy infection. 

What is, worst, morbidity rate vaccinated individual?   news, Pope still Catholic.

Although plenty conspiracy theorists claim otherwise. Thanks laying everything like that, clear risk really low. I'm wearing mask point, wearing helmet protect meteors too, lol. really really interesting hot states go indoors summer. Arizona Florida get massive spikes AC season deliberately misleading.  better that.

Efficacy comparison control placebo group. lying statistics go overall stats even unvaccinated people unlikely get virus small time frames. 

But I'm guessing understand this, dishonest. Quebec. Even worse. Ontario Quebec huge mess. It‚Äôs good hear West better. Link danger covid 19 clearly critically issue adult population, fact urgency vaccination age 12 less obvious. Children dying droves like 65, 75 80 years old beginning this. even become critically ill child able recover critical illnesses lesser long-lasting impacts adult is. reason, half committee sure necessary fully rush full authorization. Funnily enough, full authorization coming next months Pfizer Moderna, point discussion moot. Politically correct term Indian variant apparently. mean, US embassy T&amp;T announced donation. probably got delivery staff, family whatnot simply donated rest. even really mind embassy announcing this. would whole different story came White House. heard radio Boston school NH compared segregation just.


How flying fuckeroni Unfortunately claim inaccurate, I‚Äôm glad find cute. Masks aren‚Äôt required US anymore fully vaccinated people (of many), bars (and many clubs!) opened places, festivals resuming, gyms open (without masks) month, more. US month ago, far ahead here. liberating knowing people around fully vaccinated wonderful restrictions lifted. What‚Äôs evidence Canada vein US terms restrictions dropped? tout day Canada going much better off, reality things returning normal US month. Canada going see end summer. 

So yeah. Real ‚Äúcute.‚Äù Everyone knows Indian variant is. don‚Äôt call that? governments know extent problem, they're refusing shipments J&amp;J feeling mutual fucko. limited supply vaccination 60% much better 0% protection. mean medical miracle regardless religion not. got vaccine half time people expected New England basically safe now. That's incredible   everyone else replying comments said conspiracy. never said conspiracy. said don‚Äôt trust it. Source? us happy receive menus obviously cleaned days.  Super cancer? Magnets? didn‚Äôt say that. said don‚Äôt trust. crazy trust something? Vaccines work delta variant. analogy since reason scared vaccine would fear needle. Since there‚Äôs reason trust it. 

Why don‚Äôt trust it? people can‚Äôt stop hurting people take away thing makes hurt people instead of, ya know, asking adults? Fuck that! saw older guy knock employee Verizon store didn‚Äôt want wear one countless arguments lot tension days it‚Äôs messed shoot someone though hopefully justice swift deniers care. They'll die thinking right along matter they'll still dead. could require showing vaccination card and, like New York, California criminalize counterfeiting them. never said scared needles. DONT TRUST IT. keep saying stuff never even said. Stop that.  google ""store employee attacked mask"" sort news

Just look poor store employees attacked can't see failure ridiculous policy enforced. There's easy way save lives that's dropping mask mandate set ways change. insane people itchy trigger fingers likely change wins? one

CDC officially dropped mask mandate last month enforcing unnecessary policy people dying Vaccines work it. ‚ÄúIll take here‚Äù - Darwin  Every 60 seconds minute passes Africa. wrong. Chile using Siphoram. new cases unvaccinated. Costa Rica also poised receive huge lot J&amp;J donated USA, too.

But feelings bit mixed - one hand, vaccines get administered quickly, better, obviously.

But Costa Rica already secured (and payed for) enough Pfizer/BioNTech AstraZeneca vaccines basically complete adult population ti November (or even earlier). J&amp;J vaccines donated cusp expiring (but used 3 weeks expiry date).

I'd love get J&amp;J shot get with, Pfizer (mRNA) ""booster"" become available - research (while promising) still outstanding combination. we‚Äôve learned anything past 18 months it‚Äôs people fucking suck statistics. seen real evidence variants immune vaccines (particularly Pfizer vaccine). Nothing I've read indicates variants likely eventually able evade vaccines, particularly since newer formulations eventually come online. Unfortunately fallen flat, UK delayed reopening. knows actually even reopen july. goalposts could keep moving. I‚Äôm change mind, please Google it. You‚Äôll find criteria changed - information found official government websites. would never guessed. caused small amount rage there. government getting shat normally announce new vaccines arrive island, learn elsewhere. Sort of. initial studies done different enough circumstances concluding one better overall bit difficult. understand anyhow.  found original source, news around it. diagnosis end quarantine:

At beginning pandemic: 3 consecutive negatives

Later 2020: 2 consecutive negatives

January 2021: May 2021: year, cases CT&lt;35 classified positive, cases CT 35 40 would require another round complicated tests. Dude. research. sound like pawn weather people. people actually washing hands leaving restroom. 

The habits people pre-covid were‚Ä¶.less ideal.  mean, [85% American adults number keeps rising.

Of remaining percent 15%, I‚Äôd assume many elderly going eat much, likely go *someone* cellphone. 

Regardless, smaller number sparingly used paper menus available overall better solution old way. Narrator: society fine edge clearly asking put mask something triggers people edge. 

Imagine reading situation takeaway businesses requiring patrons wear mask real problem. Welcome 70% club NY!!! remind confirmation bias thing lot people power stand gain spreading propaganda makes people trust vaccines, yeah fucking hard sometimes thinking people trust vaccines idiots There's really large drop. Canada vaccinating around 0.9% population day average while. That's dropped half, looks accelerating. I'm hoping hold longer, I'm optimistic. Articles topic starting pop  categorically false. difference testing criteria vaccinated unvaccinated people purposes determining whether infection present. want prove need take orders form one nothing.

Private businesses every right say ""No shirt, shoes, vaccination proof, service"" possible virus continues replicating certain parts body extended period time patients, stopped vaccine. far unproven.

And least people symptoms psychosomatic expression fear death, they're immune fear gone. There‚Äôs also issue people don‚Äôt smartphones. mother, example. Ahahahaha miscarriage justice.

Didn‚Äôt leftist California make misdemeanor INTENTIONALLY spread HIV....a virus much much much dangerous walked store, walked back killed cashier. one act elevates third degree murder manslaughter first degree murder. He's gonna fry  So, ruined rest life reason. could home groceries right now, suffered minor inconvenience matter minutes. Instead, lucky alive soon heading prison. average time symptoms supposedly 5 days. yes, probably starts within week.

Note though that's protection *for you*. Protection others around still start day 11 mark. Employers demand proof vaccination want, that's confirmed federal court already, though remains seen CalOSHA *require* employers check whether they'll allow honor system.  reason people don‚Äôt get vaccine effecting herd immunity creating variants virus could render vaccine ineffective!

There genuinely people unable get vaccine medical reasons. people suppose live inside rest lives? scared needles?

What freedoms? People cried pandemic freedoms comes giving freedoms someone else don‚Äôt care? hypocrisy palpable!

What think going happen, road vaccine? It‚Äôs time release bomb. something major going happen would happened already! vaccine circulation almost 6 months major adverse side effects beside small isolated events make .00006% people vaccinated. (Medical reasons outstanding)

How honestly believe something bad going happen? think going happen?  none sources able convey science behind vaccines? third party supervised trials demonstrated safety? 30 years research mRNA tech? full year Phase 1 volunteers develop supercancer whatever seem think vaccines going cause? 

Or reading sources lady thinks shot made magnetic? Hot take. get everyone vaccinated lol? right. sad. Shooting cashier! private business right make rules.

Fuck shooting people. fault lies shooter. reaction asked wear mask pull gun, belong society.  Polio terrified parents. mysterious terrible. Salk hero discovered vaccine. 185 cases, 15 deaths.

Death rate lower yesterday's still much higher average. pointing stated believe conspiracy. don‚Äôt really feel way it. I'm looking facemask study take something like 10,000 negitive cases put 3 groups (surgical mask, N95 mask control group) retested month two later. show difference many tested positive group. Ideally inside outside health care sector.

Most I've seen articles experts surveys. need put stop that!

If earth become magnetized, would completely screw operation compasses. great news. Areas stupid people fine Wish vaccine passports back early April places like Disneyland. Could let open sooner, safer, potentially got folks take vax shot. Let's break argument down:

-Actually less 50% Reddit users based U.S.

-That's relevant argument pandemic almost 85% people 65 U.S. vaccinated.

That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ replying all. 100%????  Likely, hard predict long term variability. in!! sky blue! So, reasonable believe major variant/mutation occurs, vaccines less less effective? science works?

Not necessarily... according Scott Gottlieb point pandemic access people Pfizer top scientists- thinks entirely possibly virus reached stable ""fitness level"" rate new variants could slow down. Liiiiies! churches?  Restaurants getting rid physical menus bizarre. No, want scroll small phone screen see have, get fucking full size menu AZ protect well? virus mutate within 100 days. long design vaccines targeting individual spike proteins vulnerable everytime spike protein mutation. need target parts virus aren‚Äôt susceptible changes don‚Äôt get Canada sometimes.

The U.S pretty much went Leroy Jenkins case numbers hospitalizations still massively declined. understand Canada wanting move fast since fewer people two doses, acquired immunity, etc

But province gone far direction. Social distancing masks required least 85% eligible population 2 doses. 

I feeling Alberta provinces aggressive opening plans going pull (because vaccines incredible) ‚Äúsafe‚Äù provinces going look foolish months don‚Äôt think really care. It‚Äôs seeding hesitancy people skeptical shot. aren‚Äôt trying convince anyone wants take shot take it. trying solidify haven‚Äôt taken never take like pulling teeth. Let's summarize:

1. said taking safety measures avoid spreading Covid amounts paranoia, ignored them. 

2. said millions dead people logical reason, paranoia. 

3. suggested people either unhealthy fat. 

So context, please clarify exactly made last point, insinuate people worth protecting. Fear mongering China made vaccine  guess country always insane Orange Water wet Omgosh. Wonder it‚Äôs like civilized. I‚Äôm TX yeah, civilized. got home Disneyland. really enforcing masks anywhere except boarding ride. catch murder 1 charge this. Initially left store arguing, came back inside specifically shoot cashier. Sounds like death penalty case me. Exit covid 19 enter Republican disease efficacy rates major vaccines tested US broadly comparable, studies intentionally designed similar could compared. 

In studies additional testing occurs (for example, find asymptomatic cases), data typically reported separately. studies almost share primary endpoint ""cases symptomatic COVID"" broadly similar definition.

You may also see people saying emergence variants could affect comparisons, studies sequencing cases occur understand variable. US trials J+J, Pfizer Moderna occurred environment new variants factor. Also children raised insecure environments tend exhibit risky behavior! They're exclusive use border cities, 18+ register I'm waiting vaccinated next week J&amp;J, great! Yeah know people get vaccinated. feeling hoped since dad covid scare like 60 years old would get vax safe. Nope, go about, masks, tempting fate, putting others can't get vax risk. good articles counter recent conspiracy covid19 grown lab? FDA split? No, article *an advisory committee* (VRBPAC), FDA itself. one many bodies, even know necessarily majority vote approve EUA, since take vote merely voiced opinions open discussion. Perhaps read things less, along fewer critiques uninformed others are, failing understand differences FDA one advisory committees. Yeah, get menu handling phone cleaned since got dirty pocket day long exist. good comparison table (in parentheses 95% confidence interval (where we're 95% sure true percentage is)). Yeah - key difference though normal NAC metabolizes free cysteine iirc blood, little actually gets cells. time dose enough NAC actually treat COVID, patient dead side effects. gets cells full form, works.

The hydroxyl dendrimer acts ""carrier"", NAC gets sent directly inflamed cells without metabolism blood - side effects need much less get therapeutic effect. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It right way go incentive get vaccinated. still mask mandates July. Obviously private make personal discretion that's everyone one household family wearing masks other. Public spaces, still up. course are. mean, duh That's British word it. BEST VACCINATIONS bright side, really impressed efficiency mass vaccination centre showgrounds. Maybe we‚Äôll turn around. least make glance us shoulder. anyone know vaccine combo best? J&amp;J? Pfizer? Lost point get.  link articles deaths sputnik? federal judge told healthcare workers Texas hospital fire vaccinated. hope lost. virus going away. saw cousin pretty strong conservative. think going get vaccinated, covid month ago, immuntiy bit. said thought going die. Lots people going think going die get covid tell friends get vaccinated. know take personal experience get it, 600k dead 16 months enough. that's are. Contact tracing was, quite literally, nonexistent time, generally poor long period afterwards. Also infections period would misidentified flu cold due overlapping symptoms fact essentially nobody looking COVID-19 US, even people needed symptoms recent travel history abroad even get tested well February. False positives still possibility though. That's really discouraging, mean Germany supply problems people vulnerable really high exposure due jobs already vaccinated everybody knows, point get shot billions people cage months even years. 

Just shows easy forget privileges conspiracy whatever reasonings one might have. Go Bills! G7 leaders ‚Äúsay want vaccinate world end next year, actions show care protecting monopolies patents pharmaceutical giants,‚Äù said Max Lawson, Oxfam‚Äôs head inequity policy.

Human Rights Watch agreed. ‚ÄúFocusing vaccines making charitable donations enough,‚Äù Aruna Kashyap, senior counsel business human rights. ‚ÄúThe G7‚Äôs failure unequivocally support temporary waiver global intellectual property rules deadly status quo.‚Äù

Looks like pharmaceutical companies trying maintain monopolies vaccines. discussion global one involved what‚Äôs happening US took almost year, last month went social circle.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd see groups friends know getting it, various families avoided pretty good. finally hit social group early May.  


Luckily fully vaccinated since April. get it. playing safe, too, throughout it. Nope. born poor country myself. difference feeling something unfortunate thinking something wrong. basic facts life. family hungry, I'm going feed first, help others. Reality perfect. I'm going go assuming J&amp;J vaccine must flawless variants since apparently nobody ever studies it. Go Bills  really basing anything Facebook Twitter.  Congratulations, played yourself.  great weather helping us drop case count. people hanging outside transmission clearly less serious. 

Vaccination also good pace--let's hope hit wall time soon.  Yeah, full FDA approval might help bit unfortunately employers mandating vaccines getting struck states could use most. Yeah. wish May 15th, CDC said get goal 70% vaccinated month, recommend masks everywhere except maybe airlines. would given people incentive. saying May 15th vaccinated people need them, going ask vaccinated, essentially ended mask mandates everyone. big mistake opinion. She‚Äôs worried unvaccinated children legitimate concern. quite true there's lot people 30 vaccinated due medical conditions, volunteers, workers etc yes enthusiastic we're course 90% take antivaxxers seem loudest voices Chile used spike vaccines all. UK used spike vaccines exclusively (as Israel, US, Canada, Europe..). Lol agreed. read headline couple times realized weren‚Äôt talking UEFA Euro 2020 final played Wembley. read something that, seem definitive conclusion that.  Fair enough. Thank clarification, sorry misinterpretation assery responding kind. I‚Äôm medical biller high volume practice New Jersey.

It‚Äôs telling UK rushing vaccinate two doses variant. Really 30+, since younger adults invited now. UK vaccine enthusiastic population. Nice, let‚Äôs forget state population smaller city SF though SF already beat Yeah, there's going people still make excuses full approval. case employer says gotta vaccinated. think employers large company mandate them. liability issue employer. need employee infecting client gets sick, found employer require vaccinations. ... oh

*thanks clearing up* Quite obviously, herd immunity Delta variant (or something close it).

It may well herd immunity wild type and/or Alpha levels transmission represent there, numbers fallen dramatically. true, authors express study may definitive. England Public Health put closer 90 Still worth noting still get isn‚Äôt panacea, keep following measures we‚Äôve got better lid things. That's works. 34M confirmed cases (and likely millions tens millions unconfirmed) 615k deaths. vast, vast majority unvaccinated 65 death extremely rare. death rate actually even lower going forward monoclonal antibody treatment common ventilators freely available. That's good thing.  bigger problem continues spread it‚Äôll continue mutate. longer goes on, likely variant vaccine doesn‚Äôt protect against. back square 1. 

It‚Äôs us learning virus, virus learns us too. ignorance hurts us long run. Let's finish race! Seems like Oxford J&amp;J get better months. might something take consideration. broadest sense possible, Einstein. We, humanity. Keep mind authors Scottish study suggested observational study they're extrapolating several methods. 79 could low end figures England public health put closer 90. unvaccinated people continue hear unvaccinated people part still getting sick, going get bunch people hesitant get vaccinated.

I'm convinced that's ALREADY happening also 18 months data trial participants. might full FDA approval mRNA vaccines well. 

I'm also convinced full FDA approval cause big jump vaccination rates. believe people using excuse going less reason get one happens rates already plummeting. Hey preaching choir here. I'll fully vaccinated hours, I'm excited changed flair early.

I understand concerns completely control. people choose go unvaccinated made choice themselves.

It sucks yea hopefully change minds really seem cultural. BC 75% adults vaccinated 74% eligible (12+) vaccinated first dose. Demand still high, we're gunning Vermont levels want overtake. daily Reddit threads Covid case counts filled Canadians cheering one another on. Nobody forced people get it, collectively community.

Also vaccination rate tied re-opening stages. problem see lot states even restrictions. incentive get vaccinated. really affect lives someone know gets hospitalized and/or dies.

Texas pretty wide open. went visited bf May. Nobody gave shit anything really. There's still mask wearing that's it. That's great hear. edgy you, I'm sure tell you. sure kind angle trying here. Like...a white knight coronavirus subreddit? 

All said ""Better shut everything again"". edgy. Also sarcastic comment uncommon. Actually BionTech licensed vaccine Fosun, Pfizer markets. houndred million doses. trials far measure efficacy 2 weeks second dose

Yes, early UK analyses, AZ data skewed early post-2nd dose period whereas Pfizer rolled month earlier 3-week spacing doses. datasets different efficacies compared - authors even state this.  site get vaccination! cases Illinois surprise given O'Hare Midway. work field ton events stuff normally, end February came cough, sore throat, lost voice week. felt like trash whatever took long time get over. Like 3 weeks felt ""normal"" even point, regain registries voice months afterward. Tested flu, strep, negative both. urgent care doc like ""You've got kinda virus. go away soon.""

Seattle Flu study means Seattle.

NIH checking blood samples given prior - people came positive tests SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Seven gave blood five states ‚Äî ***Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania Wisconsin*** ‚Äî first official cases states. Haha lab leak? Vote different CDC director lol? could get ugly... again...

You really quantify ""really ugly"" means. Fearmongering best. predicting 100K daily infections? 200k? predicting might go 15k 50k. big differences. Vaccines work, work well. We'll get boosters needed, thing going one way one way only. might slight bumps road one I've seen credibility predicting ""things going get ugly again"". bunch bull. son got strange sickness November 2019. fever would come go almost 2 weeks. ended long lasting cough. mentioned family teacher strange new sickness going around. often wondered last year+ already Covid-19, timing talked seemed early. However, saying earlier US, December 2019.... think entirely possible Covid-19. Ugh, already got way back when, rest family never got sick... bummer worried time!! basically point everywhere US now. vaccination rate less 1/3 peak now. Supply scheduling longer issue, willingness. Alabama instance they're around 37% eligible one dose compared national average 64%. Yes , 2020.  
They kept event name. Nicely done Vermont!!! Chile uses Chinese vaccines 50-60% efficacy high infection rates - ""Chinese vaccines crap! can't stop pandemic low efficacy"".

The UK uses adenovirus vaccines ~70% efficacy worse infection rates e.g. Israel ~90% Pfizer - ""You can't really compare, enough data, maybe given different populations, protect hospitalization death"". Well lower mask, chin completely alone, need touch too! Epidemiologically make sense legitimate infections. match subsequent clusters infection, likely direct contact cases Wuhan. Almost cases would dead ends Covid spread time control measures place. money false positives due cross reactivity coronavirus antibodies. top exported 329 Millions worldwide. Thank you. always like know source. actually huge number Uber/Lyft app-delivery drivers. cumbersome make frequent quick stops put &amp; off. awe edgy 

So alpha bro  Vermont also leads nation Bernie Sanders keeping real Washington people get worked people wearing masks situations don‚Äôt need to? 

you don‚Äôt know peoples‚Äô situations ‚Äî like need mask sides trip it‚Äôs short drive often won‚Äôt bother taking it‚Äôs uncomfortable ‚Äî difference make either way??  One Italy, kinda telling. rest Philly DC. bring members families got sick kept dodging bullet. includes mine, since got daughter got sick too. NYC little bit different. unvaxed population non-English speakers, gig workers cant take time off, without transportation options. anti-vax, need different support/options. means walk-up sites low uptake areas, translators, cash incentives missed work. working, take time mass vax sites last months.

I'm sharing counter narrative everyone unvaccinated NYC making ""active"" choice. state less 50% removed restrictions. Estimates know unknown cases vaccinations somewhere around 70% immunity. curiosity, seeing anything wrong anything (+ family, friends, peers) living rich countries? No. Better known ""Creemee"" Vermont! keep saying this, maybe want true. fall/winter comes, 95% people infected, hospitalized, unfortunately die unvaccinated. unvaccinated people continue hear unvaccinated people part still getting sick, going get bunch people hesitant get vaccinated. We'll also 18 months data trial participants. might full FDA approval mRNA vaccines well. sure data FDA would need 18 months. issue pop 18 months, popping 24, 36 months longer. That's vaccines body works. vaccine herpes. stay life way. either get sick fast, like blood clots myocarditis, don't. would extremely shocked 2 years vaccine pulled weird shit popped see commercials lawyers saying get mRNA vaccine, please call compensation.  shadowed family medicine clinic FL month surprised patients vaccinated.  


I whole lot trying convince people get vaccinated month course, nevertheless pleased Billy Bob Susie Jane trump shirts Pasco drawl told got 2nd shot. Oh rough getting sick twice like that! 

Glad get Covid, though! Yes, shit they‚Äôll first state. population one smallest U.S. Yes. 70% people state (which is, 80% people 12+) enough push R-value disease substantially 1, meaning average person infecting fewer one person duration illness.

As long keep R-value disease 1, time disease die number people infected continue drop. also gotten free like 2 min let jab you. Judging absolute wasteland replies‚Ä¶ maybe?   Oh jeez, insanely badly run account. Vermonter here. daily average number new cases past week 7. Yes, 7 new cases covid per day state. community gives shit neighbors looks like. I'm semi rural area. get covid here. December / January year. got crazy! 

I know others bad, tell everyone know bad swaying others direction too. according r/maryland It‚Äôs definitely official account, based activity threatened

""informed"" would protect though? 

Are concerned protecting unvaccinated Vermontians unvaccinated Floridians something? know viruses however  COVID-19 negatively impacts fertility young males? tylenol handy fever drink lots water.  Anything serious likely die car accident drive vaccination site. Stop voting stuff ya big girl go free karma sites stuff views general problem -- cancer screening basically stopped initial screening appointments breast cervical colon cancers March 2020 decreased eighty-six ninety-four percent compared average volumes previous years comparable times. follow-up report published July 2020, EHRN reported number breast, cervical colorectal cancer screenings increased, numbers still twenty-nine thirty-six percent previous they're still behind this.   New York STATE 377 cases. 

Denever backlog. weekly average 65 cases.

Phoenix 289 daily cases yesterday. Maricopa county, Phoenix in, 289 cases yesterday. county 3 times population city alone.  least 297 children died COVID-19 April 19 United States.  Anybody ever tell bore? That's great. going people move there. Woooo yeah go California!! know improved. Good thing finally getting shots arms. Spent 29 30 birthday quarantine (my birthday early April). Never want again. 1. know full risks yet started US (currently 6%). new variant contagious original strain infect smaller children HIGHER rate. Combine selfish people wear mask, get vaccinated, gather crowds, spread easily. look UK already.
2. shit catch even vaccinated. Nothing 100%. 98% better 0%. almost like understand basic math.
3. one ""learn live it"" PREVENTABLE. Wear fucking mask get vaccinated. PERIOD. OR, move woods participate society. 


We've eliminated small pox, polio, measles, many viruses USA. ZERO reason dealing covid like this. Cmon man think critically!

Look definition ""coerce"" come back smarty pants. Thanks clarification. illiberal authoritarian, authoritarians gonna authoritarian...

However, given state vaccine availability, even vaguely pragmatic practical stage? (Which say government dumb enough try!) Shit CDC director elected position he's lied us bat virus research first place. exactly humanity unelected bureaucrat seemingly running show accountable anyone? Oh love Foo Fighters! fun me! sick two half months early 2020. Flu like symptoms. Tested over. Nothing. one could explain wrong. symptoms Vid, supposedly wasn‚Äôt country time.

After that, despite area several occasions likely exposed, got official COVID week 1st shot May year. Going Worldometers, US hit 600,000 deaths month ago. wondering methods CDC Worldometers using record deaths.

Looks like US fell two places 20th per capita deaths. I'm also metro Detroit area. stepmom came something horrible early February 2020 negative flu. Looking back, classic covid symptoms, borderline severe, knocked ass almost two months. husband also whatever had, although thankfully severe. certainly fun. several nights absolutely sure going stop breathing.

It would basically admission wrong give vaccines people.  risk J&amp;J shot tiny compared complications Covid-19. China lied covered caused pandemic. literally said human human transmission January 14th 2020. 

That‚Äôs major scandal Many people want get Covid, getting vaccinated FL. guys going parties? live rural area likely voted politicians gutted health care. ""Healthcare deserts"" happen themselves. vaccines target spike protein, mechanism virus infects hosts, likelihood variant simultaneously resistant vaccines *and* infectious enough problematic incredibly low. UK. Sorry clear :) flu, bro! barely 1/4 12-15 y/o gotten shots, shows parents really hurry getting kids vaccinated, contrary popular reddit belief ""kids doomed!!!"" husband really sick Feb 2020 well. Negative flu test, twice, short breath almost 2 weeks despite pneumonia either. really bad cough too. locked hard March hit knew baby, neither us got sick could get vaccinated. never sick like February either. always wonder covid. US's epidemic almost he's starting pull back constant updates. 

A vacation deserves Glad sense require it. question aren‚Äôt kids 12 vaccinated, answer bc age group currently trial phase. Hopefully trials done kids eligible vaccination school starts fall. Depends badly parents want 3-11 y/o vaccinated looking 12-15 general response, really sure US reach milestone. them?? seems crazy I'm american therefore idea pandemic handled ""we""? country in?  US allows 12+ get vaccinated. county's public health office still screaming void trying push masking vaccinated people despite compliance like 30% new infections per day like 0-3 among 35,000 people. 

It's plain sad It‚Äôs completely fair ridicule someone virus response, virus political nature it‚Äôs reviewing restaurant based politics someone gets absolutely flamed Yelp basically true Toronto.

The neighbourhood kensington-chinatown (which large chinese population...obviously) lowest vaccination rate city. However, never designated ""hotspot"" additional vaccine deliveries first place, meant low rate transmission. except Vermont, south go, likely find deal H  happens, let tell you. Hopefully less going forward. mainly cleared area warning.  blasted away like 50-60 people Christmas would bigger deal. US 43% vaccinated.  percent Americans (children included).  Speaking hospitalizations. many people go doctor hospital get flu? febrile respiratory illness stay home, data under-report spread, seems. lol people wonder we're rude transplants. guy stereotype lmao. sorry give exact number 1/100th person. people really don‚Äôt care, care dying?

It‚Äôs global problem COVID variants (like Delta) continue become lethal potentially evade vaccines, *voila*, negligence endangers health everyone. Again. French resident visited China hospitalised December 27, 2020. Considering incubation period COVID-19 - 6.4 days average (Wang et al., 2020) - well evidence showing viral shedding may occur asymptomatic patients (Jiang et al., 2020; Park et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020), conceivable virus circulating released sewage Paris area roughly time northern Italy, indicated positive sewage samples.

A Spanish study mean, lot reviews (I looked them) people brigading country... legitimate patrons. That's spirit Yelp Google reviews.  I'm sorry, incorrect. Again, thank contribution. Cringe There's always gross crumbs bag I'm also wrist masker lol, feels weird pull face fits better properly. Gives shit what?

What happened sub... shithole   Forehead masking far superior Yes. mentioned west. whole treatment took less 5 minutes start finish.

Where I'm at, us wait around 15 minutes see complications nurses watched us. probably unnecessary. vaccines 100% effective original strain covid even less effective new variants. find hard way like everything else continue take precautions. Comments others seem suggest numbers based eligible people directly comparable good, however true UK weeks back.

It'll interesting see plays though since main difference Canada re-opening much slowly theres much larger 1st dose coverage. Yea, missing one massive key issue: antibodies produce sterilizing protection natural infection may produce worse antibodies stopping new infection vaccine produce neutralizing antibodies.

&amp;#x200B;

Hell, studies shows N-skewed antibody responses actually make COVID worse, suggesting natural infections may actually worse vaccine induced immunity, especially protection wanes. Well theses neighborhoods don‚Äôt chain pharmacies regular grocery stores. That‚Äôs pop sites translators important. It‚Äôs also missing work GET shot that‚Äôs issue many. It‚Äôs fear missing work due side effects stops people. one wants lose job. city interesting survey last month. 

I‚Äôm sure antivax people mixed in, especially orthodox communities. it‚Äôs complicated issue needs multiple solutions tailored individual communities. Irish Twitter. think vast majority population anti-lockdowners covid deniers, actual surveys show they're tiny proportion population. Congrats Vermont , love Cali üéâ mask discipline California insane. Wonder remaining 20 people want get vaccinated Almost 40 mil. Ya, 100% agree.

Plus anecdotally, flu bad year. sorry dad. ‚ù§ curiosity, many variants CDC labeled variant concern? First: hiding fact 80% people 12+ (the people eligible) first does. saying 80% fully vaccinated full population. Yes wording might bit confusing everyone ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù within 5 weeks due Vermont‚Äôs scheduling second shot conjunction first. 

Second: lifted Covid restrictions. vaccinated people, unvaccinated well. matter people lie not. restrictions lie get around 40 million people? Zero COVID deaths day. 

Pretty incredible. Go California! Bold prediction: ten years now, specialists long-COVID care primarily Southern US. Yeah province wide we're 75%. weve done lot targetted vaccinations hotspots. bet 6% lag richmond due governments distribution plan targetted hotspots. read whole article sure addressed that.   false positives possible cross contamination, would hope NIH manage bring outside COVID testing facility... Despite claims, EXTREMELY likely false positives. Seems like LOT stories coming out. sure bunch similar studies ending around time something else driving this. H1N1 (The '09 pandemic strain) running rampant December western world, that's likely illness everyone's remembering.  info Sinovac wors variant? Ive heard vaccines  work homeless shelter get vaccinated.... well might dumbest person ever lived.  RSV RSV. different virus lab identified.  hurt happy? 

Kellyanne Conway. put Hillary Clinton costume lured sewer. fully vaccinated even attend higher education wonder expect see? like saying water wet. Might also something ranked 49th population? future. 

new hires.

&amp;#x200B;

SAN FRANCISCO ‚Äî San Francisco **eventually require** workers hospitals, nursing homes jails fully vaccinated COVID-19, limited exceptions. 
The order notable companies internally debated whether impose vaccination requirements workers. 
The order San Francisco, well UC Cal State systems, go effect **U.S. Food Drug Administration gives formal approval one vaccines.** Currently, three vaccines distributed U.S. received ‚Äúemergency use authorization.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

SF 80% one shot, 70% - doubt many HC workers good start. Yeah like 144 people live Vermont bears   mean, bigger pharmacies, grocery stores, even without appointment. I'm betting there's vaccine skepticism there.

But that's case, here's another solution: employers gig companies vaccine workshops. protection Delta variant?

yes I'm reminded Spongebob episode stays indoors outside world scary. agree, Scotland ""jag"" completely unbiased POV superior terminology Canada still issues long time, highlighting statement.

For first dose quite wait. Yes like CYA there's messaging, there's ***actually happening.*** 

&amp;#x200B;

the UK unvaccinated areas too.

Oh totally agreed that. got argument weekend sub someone fully convinced Canada fall fourth wave worse everything we've experienced point, purely Delta variant.

Frankly, fully vaccinated wearing mask pointless. literally darwinism. Idiot chooses protect ends dying (possibly).

That's ""survival fittest"" idiot less likely tompass idiot genes.  Great, long it‚Äôs vaccinated health care workers. larger might expect percentage health care workers won‚Äôt get vaccinated. ""What talking about, man? kind race war New Jersey?"" vaxxed, care? not, what's wrong you? Look dude, I'm taking vaccine. makes feel uncomfortable I'm sorry.

But body choice take it. Simple that. evidence varients real? Yeah family lucky catch grandma lost two people care facility it. Family snuck lady came back infected 4 people. Shocking sympathy people can't tolerate get access vaccine.

The effects vaccines calculated COMPARED natural resistance (i.e. placebo control group). Instead, tried claim natural protection part protection vaccines.

That's dishonest, moreover, vaccines really good - need lie them. stand own. Since seem missed first people can't benefit directly vaccine due immunocompromising conditions, rely rest us order stay safe.

Natural immunity inferior mRNA vaccines, lasts months. variants continue develop (in large part thanks vaccine hesitancy) boosters required maintain herd immunity. Unless trust person next lie‚Ä¶.. call Zorro would've thunk Well, said ""currently"", less dense understand? Well luckily vaccines widely available! Anyone chooses get one time!

You misinterpreting data trials problem. Furthermore, even highly vaccine resistant variant unlikely completely nullify immunity. Even 50% time people got reduced symptoms reduced transmissibility, would make far easier control highly vaccinated areas. see would really work. chances winning pretty slim 18 million. someone afraid vaccine, think extremely tiny chance winning vacation sway them. common two million $50 gift cards step right direction, even then, 1/9 chance winning one week's worth groceries going really change people's minds vaccine? hope works though people get vaccine.

The level natural protection measure protection vaccine. fact, level protection vaccine determined COMPARISON natural protection.

Can agree this? finds shit annoying false I‚Äôm saying, acknowledging said, difference something happen vaccine something happen vaccine, like something happen covid something happen covid, everyone going see way.

My entire point statistical justification one, other. Deaths occurring ""with"" covid occurring FAR frequently would expected random chance, strong evidence deaths caused covid. Deaths occurring ""with"" recent vaccination occurring rate would expected random chance, strong evidence deaths caused vaccine. go running. Wait weeks party down. EU still miles behind UK Nope.

J&amp;J's shitty quality control oversight ensured lost potent weapon fight COVID. Basically U.S. subsidizing vaccines produce sit unused. fuck wrong Hawaii? They‚Äôve pretending virus like 5,000% serious since beginning. That's literally position CDC. Masks modest protective effect, even close vaccines. California too? gotten vaccine I'm miserable. Everyone doesn‚Äôt get vaccine eventually going get Covid. It‚Äôs going disappear time soon. looks hanging foreseeable future. 

When get it, maybe you‚Äôll fine. maybe you‚Äôll permanent lung scarring, permanent heart damage, chronic fatigue, sexual dysfunctions, changes cognition, etc. dice roll you. Yeah americans REALLY FUCKING STUPID. appears way you‚Äôre dead set misinterpreting data. 

Substitute 20% 0.5% 95% 75% previous equation. There‚Äôs J&amp;J data. 

If vaccine confidence interval least 95% reduction severe cases, least deaths, surely much more. I‚Äôm shocked, shocked tell you! Water wet. Dude way Yep... need less density understand using stable genius brain. Delusion freaks? say COVID hoax? wish might granted. think blaming rent prices vaccinations Yep, agree. That's ridiculous part could've played better even self interest still benefited! good job risk aside, countries won‚Äôt adopt Canada save lives frustrating.

Yes is. seeing BC's response specifically, (not sure provinces comparison tbh) Canada's model used example countries. 

The time interval doses 21 days pfizer 28 days Moderna. minimum number days required make second dose effective booster. (and still knowledge, correct I'm wrong.) maximum length inbetween doses, estimated 4 months 16-18 weeks. 

*However* giving people first shot reduce spread incredibly effective. Even good portion population needs third booster later they've passed maximum delay end essentially ""first dose"" again, huge deal much spread reduced.

It's actually insane well we're controlling spread. mind-bottling.  Noooooo Nice j/k.... maybe vaccinate cows... ;-) Gotta protect Ben Jerry goodness!! ü§£üòÇü§£

No really - college term ended, also sending vaccinated kiddos back states! Woot woot!

Edit - spelling really try stop spreading ‚Äúuncertainty.‚Äù It‚Äôs common tactic trolls get naive sow doubt vaccine efficacy. binary logic makes sense. Science work way. 

Vaccines work. Delta variant transmissible. one near herd immunity. Make sense? Insanity. still way early. wear mask safe, little piece cloth. vaccines 100%. bad, bad place.

Just say ‚Äúcomplete human extinction‚Äù ""Then probably will""  Anti-anti vax, glad got warp speed ccine Ok yes excuses anymore states! Seriously, identical responses 2 different comments?

Not anyone age 12. isn‚Äôt you, it‚Äôs can‚Äôt yet get vaccinated. Michigan 160 cases yesterday population 10 million, Michigan hot spot even close more. Yup beaches. :-)

It's always impressive confident amateurs know better actual immunologists virologists. part ‚Äúoh it‚Äôll outbreaks future‚Äù could unsettle someone bought ‚Äúway deadlier flu‚Äù line (to counter opposite ofc understandably) especially consumed negativity around anecdotes covid long covid. Probably thought virus sticking around distresses think victory completely kill virus.  friend got fine, brother got dead. I'm glad lucky hope give anyone ended dead noobs Why? yet hospitalizations deaths still low. Also, England basically western country currently ‚Äútrouble‚Äù Delta variant. comparing timelines, many European countries, Canada, US well UKs pace. believe shot significantly reduces spread. kids get shot fall go long way towards herd immunity.

What mean ‚Äúkeep up‚Äù? wearing mask grocery store hard? I‚Äôm calling shutdowns anything. simple things months. even button hit say ""this misinformation""- twitter absolutely give god damn fuck. vaccines speak weren‚Äôt mRNA vaccines, wouldn‚Äôt still involve substantial risk?

What matters body responds, delivery comes cost leaving lot people worse quality life, especially must wait months upon months surgeries, doctors appointments, checkups, more. people wait seen, conditions worsen get serious. ultimately, everyone worse off. ideal view.

Dude, need stop believing everything read Internets. understanding UK adhered strictly age group vaccination strategy US, transmission probably occurring young people chance get vaccinated yet. Whereas immunity US spread among age groups open everyone, fully vaccinated important delta. US may deal pockets transmission less vaccinated states/towns unlikely see widespread spikes again. I‚Äôm worried. never know see mutation is, develop vaccine, test it. I‚Äôd rather give Covid inch takes mile. think it‚Äôs premature declare victory Covid much spread still happening. ~Mild Shock~ .... why/how running tournament unvaccinated players?! insane. realize US border closed too?   give idea, current wait second dose many provinces 2 months. ‚ÄúWe surplus vaccines United States, western New York used. they‚Äôre used, get discarded medical waste. shouldn‚Äôt Canadian come community get vaccinated?‚Äù

I recently spoke pharmacists border states told often throw away lots vaccines they're spoil/have used day can't find arms get into. mRNA highest degree protection symptom onset contagiousness comes around day 11-12 first dose - there's protection lot after. Protection continue build, probably months after.

There problems we're much victim mentality Trump instilled supporters gun law.

Oh, Dr. Fauci...if government would step ""help govern"" unruly states telling governors *exactly* do. Implement system NY did. Enforce water testing randomized testing. Ask citizens affected areas get tested, utilize data enforce lockdowns areas! leave idiots. 

But happen. know coming. (At least, many savvy Redditors do.) wait, hope booster gets approved, wear mask places vaccinated, pray. 

Here Florida we're lagging behind. Alabama Mississippi fewer people vaccinated. Gamma risen, take next. Delta knocking door, patiently waiting come in.

[Here's review includes randomized controlled findings pretty much line studies illnesses prepandemic: may small effect preventing transmission wearer, hard exact highly visible intervention/control (e.g. cannot really prevent maskless controls behaving differently).

Regardless, primary effects mask mandates reducing transmission wearer, behavioral changes (people interact less wear mask - less likely linger shop example), I'm sure need particularly exact estimate transmission wearer.. least, big part justifying mask mandates, work.   Lol think delta variant bad, wait spirit airlines variant hits US Again, makes think body special opposed everyone else special immunity? people natural immunity do?

What 'stupid' vaccine? know tbh.  curious, studies show long covid even real?   escaping lab one thing seemed insinuate made lab made worse.

And even enough gray area middle misinterpretation. would anyone want hospitalized? even want moderate symptoms like getting flu?


We vaccinating people always feel perfect, vaccinating keep hospital worse. would anyone want 60% 88% protection even moderate illness?


Who said would?


If Covid reduced feeling bit rough days that's win. also reduces transmission infection window cut 2/3rds reduced viral loads. much smaller window catch it, smaller load greatly diminishing initial potency, vaccinated chances even notice immune system kerb-stomps it. Somewhat ironically, happy cake day! Even everything know masks wrong, shoot someone asked wear one.

The fact think otherwise quite telling kind person are. rain Spain falls mainly plain billionaires track real reason areas dropped massive amounts infections already. states bad side graph lowest population density Oh man, happen, super obnoxious. It‚Äôs suggesting link proving it. I'll honest....

I love Jon Stewart.

His rant....was best.  12 deaths tens thousands infections. That's win vaccines.  how....did get tagged Europe? people remember one 12 eligible vaccinated still risk. UK?

I‚Äôm risk dying catch Covid. God knows I‚Äôll finally able get vaccine. don‚Äôt get work home forced ride crowded trains to/from work everyday, constant fear random one infect (and result kill) me. Despite high risk, can‚Äôt get vaccine. Asking around gets met ‚Äúyou elderly finished‚Äù. Honestly though small aka less crowded might alright.

Depending vaccination status still may quarantine arrives January. hoping they'll enough get vaccinated leaves then, they're still struggling get enough go around older folks.

Usa intensions vaccinate local National security staff island . Usa probably took similar policies nations huge social influence thier hand affairs. Illinois 69.5% adults initiating vaccination, likely next state cross 70% line. downvoted? They‚Äôre *right*. Blatant greed reason farce happening.  fuck can‚Äôt. Cases ‚Äúdown‚Äù they‚Äôve reduced testing. ‚Äúfewer‚Äù Covid beds use changed phrase ‚Äúin use‚Äù counts doesn‚Äôt count. Still hardly anyone vaccinated. anywhere close that. Agreed. Although, seems new conspiracy theory Americans latching onto...I feeling really excuse sinophobic. history taught anything, US always loves scapegoat something Asian enemy. past Japan China.

Zero high vaccine acceptance Ah yes, floor made floor. lot people simply aren‚Äôt aware touchless thermometers work person room temperature room 45 minutes, you‚Äôve stepped cold hot sun reflect touchless thermometer doesn‚Äôt get kind reading contact thermometer gets Fear, uncertainty.

Humans like prevention. far prefer encounter problem fix it, that's evolution taught us do. also often means people wait something noticeably wrong fixing it.

Unfortunately, vaccination perfect position people want reject emotional position. They're perfectly healthy infected virus 18 months, take action now?

Remember, almost people deny reality (be virus denial flat earthism) emotional position, logical one. EU currently vaccinating 4 million people per day, vaccine acceptance many countries gone last month expect vaccination go countries way beyond 70% vaccination goal. 

Here Netherlands expect 85% acceptance means last second doses administered end August. anyone know Chicago at? fair, mom falls exactly demographic highest risk AZ blood clotting, even though tiny risk, waiting month receive another kind seemed like option satisfy her. think that's valid, choosing vaccines, rather choosing vaccine vaccine. think whoever mentions argument AZ someone who'd rather take another vaccine. like AZ shots going waste, definitely someone else take happily. labs apparently issued fake reports meet daily testing quota 50,000 tests set Uttarakhand High Court Kumbh. Im assuming talking Canada - know provinces, BC officially said go Moderna Pfizer IIRC, that's Moderna deliveries skewed usually dump end quarter meet quota. think safely assume able get Pfizer second dose, study formal approval Pfizer Moderna becomes problem Simple response hearing that: why? would someone rather confirm death believed consequences getting vaccine happen them? people really ok dying proving point, changed mind countless times life?

You right.

A 1 10000 chance get corona means 9999 10000 chance get corona.

30 touches day, 365 days means roll dice 10940 times.

So chance get corona would 0.9999 power 10940 = 0.334 result, chance get corona 1-0.334 = 0.666 two-thirds.  Awesome   'hygiene theater'

""Lockdown"" strong word, phrase ""Pretty much normal life"". cool anecdote. even provided country in, laws vary based country. without us able read case, can't take anecdote proof anything. 30% extremely low number. That‚Äôs damning all. Wha.. What? logic, use Google look research links resources, conducting research??? different reddit? difference instead asking machine/search algorithm research links, asking real humans research links. Sure, case reporting extremely inaccurate, believe even modern countries tested everyone asked fot might picked anywhere 25-50% total cases, especially every third case nonsymptomatic, people get picked contact tracing testing. Poorer countries like India, Brazil etc. people dont even access basic health care facilities, could picked much 10% cases, usually test sick people made overcrowded hospitals. surely anywhere 30-50% people USA EU must covid already. question immune really right now, long (natural immunity light cases drops fast, would surprised unvaccinated people could easily catch again. Plus mutations easily overcome immunity, like Brazil... dont know, think despite 70% fully vaccinated september modern coutries like usa europ. union, still see high numbers cases... hospitals shoukd stay empty, covid ravage local vulnerable clusters people like young students, church visitors believers, others. new delta variant infectious find victims anywhere can, herd immunity apply anymore many antivax morons children wont get vaccine, cannot expect get much past 70% people vaccinated, whereas need close 80-90% delta variant disappear. since vaccine efficiency 100% 50-90% almous contagious chicken pox measles, covid years quite high numbers, unless vaccination becomes mandatory people, children babies included... helps homogeneous population white educated people.

Less people died Japan last year 2019. first YoY decrease deaths decade.  weekly average COVID hospitalizations Texas gone four days row study single standard dose vaccine provided 76% protection overall symptomatic covid-19 first 90 days vaccination protection falling time frame. clear, however, long protection might last single dose \*\*there cases 90 days make meaningful mean say, 90 days single dose, symptomatic cases low reliably measure low were?\* Sounds promising. try study again, bigger sample size?

And unless I'm misreading answer question wanted answered: measured effectiveness 2 weeks second dose, given 4 12 weeks. found protection stronger 12 week regimen. i.e. found effectiveness greater 14 weeks first dose, second dose given 12 weeks 6 weeks first dose, second dose given four weeks. would wanted see effectiveness 14 weeks first dose, second dose, 4 week second dose, 12 week second measured reported directly, still strongly suspect time first dose what's important here. Fourteen weeks first dose, going great immunity response whether get second dose not. probably better 14 weeks 1st dose 2 weeks 2nd dose 1st 6 weeks ago. study hinted that, reporting 74% efficacy 1 dose 90 days, 55% efficacy 2 doses six weeks sicne 1st dose. again, they're analyzing different trials different conditions concrete.

Yeah, second dose probably helps, none studies shown second dose substantial really. show efficacy higher second dose first dose, compare would've first alone simply given first dose time thing. drops cases suggest outbreak far building herd immunity hard way - time tell.

I‚Äôm mistaken lions share cases vulnerable unvaccinated (or partially vaccinated) individuals primarily fact young mobile. efficient strain spreading among mobile viable hosts. No, wouldn't. Russian researchers call two currently widespread variants emerged within Russia ""Northwestern"" ""Siberian"", multitude viruses diseases names places first discovered. Americans buying fake vaxx cards droves. Good luck them. Meanwhile, Trump 100% got vaccine instant humanly possible so.

These people mushed-in cereal bowls heads. doubt it. delta variant makes 60% cases per outbreak.info. India, nepal Uganda know spreads unvaccinated populations. People probably shaming jerk, apparently vaccinated. Everyone wants vaccine get one now, hence it‚Äôs acceptable return normal now. Pretty cut dry. Compared variants, well. Especially UK, population largely vaccinated AZ vaccine, percentage population vaccinated forecasted reach levels European countries highest vaccine acceptance.

That basically means delta variant continue spread British population (and possibly populations), comparitively low protection vaccines offer infection (although offer good protection cases would require hospitalisation), one take account variant spreads much faster, much deadly, probably resulting fact continue spreading population.

Herd immunity achieved variant current vaccines have. Luckily workers several Biotech companies working night day develop new ones combat emerging varints. Yup beyond happy retail reason. return dudes order without card used, threatened something simple that. NNN reliable sub COVID-19 information. population absolutely ravaged take adequate precautions.

Fall COVID rear ugly head again, mostly schools fall around holidays. We‚Äôll see big push vaccinations around then, doubt we‚Äôll see significant movement numbers; people notoriously stubborn set ways. Areas Northeast (including anything north DC), West Coast better rest country due vaccination rates rest country exceptions (such New Mexico) dealing scattered outbreaks time.  Let's simple math.

Masks US usually single layer cloth. Results shown best 40% effective. Let's assume 90% total population wearing masks. That's bit high allows bit leniency mask type, effective others. best looking 36% reduction spread. Enough slow down, stop it. saw winter wave, subside till behavior changed Christmas. numbers account incorrect wearing masks though, would lower reduction spread.

Now let's look vaccines. 43% population vaccinated vaccines low end 90% effective, see 38.7% reduction spread. Add partially vaxxed post infected individuals (estimated 30% US population CDC), effective immune percentage 65ish%. assume natural immunity bit weaker Fermi estimate average immunity 85%, looking 55% reduction spread.

So far actual data suggest adverse side affects negligible vaccines going around 6 months point.  sun finally rising east setting west, too. Never thought I‚Äôd see day! interesting observation looking statistics various different maps noticed trend: appears every country facing/faced uptick, surge, massive wave delta dominant variant face March/April surge Covid. 

France, Germany, Italy, Canada faced early spring waves peaked early mid april. US, too, also early Spring wave peaked mid April, though wave far mild Winter one obviously, still significant, especially States like Michigan. listed countries still trending cases vaccines distributed. 

India face early Spring wave, massive wave ramped April peaked May. UK also Spring wave surge, facing significant uptick right now. However, seems slowing quite bit predict plateau next week, wave nearly bad Winter one. 

But possible Delta may role surges, certain countries facing surges lack early Spring wave?  Designboom, sounds legit would gander US system worse Canadians Canadian system Americans. don‚Äôt healthcare states fucked. totally agree that‚Äôs major problem. Sorry hear go :/

And right, take account prior infection - trying use round numbers say even high levels vaccination, problem. hard come sort really good numbers - think know well delta reinfects. also know, people getting vaccinated, many prior infection.

On point...Israel higher percentage total vaccinations place months, whereas UK slow give 2nd shots always lagged well behind Israel per capita. Currently however Israel flattened vax curve UK still increasing, eventually catch up. Well, consider much, much better gotten two doses Sinovac getting sick -- since available. Rather still hold vaccine waiting Pfizer's limited production capability. sounds like fairly serious upward trend, great. get Pfizer another vaccine later available! Yeah I've got lot friends colleagues age bracket... worry either. bars shut restrictions months end?

I believe need prove anything anymore. vaccinated not, problem. article:

Correct. another issue also medical issues could nothing Covid simply result due ill people paying attention physical well-being. probably necessary. positive antibody test May 2020 reliably indicates prior infection confer robust immune response since full virus contains epitopes spike protein vaccines. memory cells BMPCs able produce antibodies response new challenge, even though actual antibody titers blood wane time.

They're allergic microchips OK get now, UK relied AZ much restricted 40+, dont pfizer moderna youngsters. still, got many vaccines total (plus new vaccine factory produce enough revaccinate whole UK 3 months, finished?) would expect 40+ doses? initial surge dont enough? Seemed back March April UK enough doses vaccinate anyone May...

At least EU goes smooth now, right vaccinate daily doses equal 1% population, everyone registered far 16+ group get first jab end June... early 30s got first jab 8th June, waiting unusually long opening (more 2 weeks). sibling 20s jab next week. 

Vaccinations going quite smoothly must say, bad everything public requires either negative pcr test completed vaccination, summer wont free August. envy Americans, basically anybody wanted first dose April second early May, summer free them. 

Hopefully EU completely done vaccinations end August, lockdown welcomed, everybody choice want get vaccinated face nasty mutations next fall... unfortunately polititions still keep speaking human rights every life sacres, dont, maybe even full vaccination wont mean full freadom. used bartender/server that‚Äôs think whenever see server full section‚Ä¶ must absolutely roasting. used go freezer busy nights like 20 seconds cool off. wouldn‚Äôt able hang mask on. people may even known Covid,‚Äù said, ‚Äúbut continue present conditions unusual health history, may worth investigation medical professional they‚Äôre working with.‚Äù

Also, wish done blinded similar test equivalent samples 2018 &amp; earlier see generated false positives. possible 9 positive results pre-existing antibodies different coronavirus.

Thanks answer, appreciate :) Hmmm, yes floor made floor  replied comment said could wrong. I'm admitting could wrong. I'm insane. don‚Äôt break lunatics anti vax circle jerk going head Again, I'll happily stop categorizing people conspiracy theorists come even single good non-conspiracy reason mistrust vaccine. 

I give shit want put danger refusing vaccine. Seriously, really, really don't. However, problem people like compromising herd immunity putting others risk. people can't benefit directly vaccine due immunocompromising conditions, rely rest us order stay safe. 

What's really toxic putting lives others risk pay attention high school biology. news: sun rises morning sets evening mean variant big threat US since around 50% fully vaccinated spreads much quicker. also immune evasive first dose, partially vaccinated risk.  people died vaccines openly accessible public. agreement addition 300 million shots United States already purchased Pfizer brings total number Pfizer/BioNTech shots purchased United States 800 million, Times White House earlier year also pledged $4 billion COVAX urged countries boost donations well. way! supply quantity perspective absolutely matters, too. fact there's enough Pfizer, moderna, j&amp;j means see another EUA US, irrespective current approval status. dad raised today‚Äôs world, would labeled autistic sure.

It‚Äôs crazy year ago could socialize people past couple months essentially simulate normal conversation weird people much. blows mind. yeah learning read cues rate people‚Äôs satisfaction tweak algorithm. 

I‚Äôm still strange dude least I‚Äôm one meshes lot better now. Older people likelier get breakthrough infections, like likelier get bad infections without vaccine. Multiple studies shown antibody levels lower older people. That's discussion around boosters elderly rather everyone.  Ugh‚Ä¶ bums people far gone.  take full stadiums? right done across U.S. personally love see it. we‚Äôre good position right country. still think case last summer fall? constitutional right wear raunboots. go original source. Go journal articles ignore news. seem think least somewhat right otherwise would say it? without evidence suggesting varients real would classify insane, least somewhat. perfect (I math wrong head), close:

-Take population 1M people w/ 950K vaccinated (95% coverage) assume two groups similar mortality risks.

-Over period time, COVID spreads population 50K unvaccinated group mortality rate 0.1%, means 50 die. 

-If apply mortality rate 950K group, get 950 deaths. vaccinated vaccine reduces deaths 97% compared unvaccinated group, 29 deaths. 

-So 29 deaths vaccinated group 79 total deaths = 36.7% total deaths

However compare mortality rate groups see vast difference risk. 1 1K unvaccinated group vs. 1 33K vaccinated group, risk 30x lower vaccinated. get post? wasn‚Äôt minimizing deaths.

I‚Äôm saying scientific perspective can‚Äôt draw meaningful statistics sample 42 deaths. know it‚Äôs enough lot elderly.

Great, appreciate personal attack. 

Listen, here's - took 99.5% survival rate unvaccinated, tried include protection given vaccine. That's said percentage people die infection? 0.5%. 
 
Calculating shows J&amp;J vaccine 99.25% effective probable death infection. Even crazy high estimate 33% covid cases become severe, puts 99.7%.

Don't things like that. dishonest. Stop it. Lol imagining going head read that... wheels spinning ever slightly... Amazing. It‚Äôs people actually dying extremely small subset people vaccinated. makes sound like 30% dying vaccinated. reality it‚Äôs 30% *extremely* small number. top this, specifically one variant, actual percentage dying vaccinated even smaller. It‚Äôs click bait bullshit.

Tell difference:

30% infected dying delta variant fully vaccinated!!!

30% less 1% died covid fully vaccinated. People can‚Äôt get vaccinated vaccines might work well like immunocompromised cancer chemo patients.

I'm older thinking process changed age. flu vaccine ""covid vaccine"" different, get that. saying, awhile since I've gotten one, gotten sick. know, maybe symptoms slightly sore arm, like me, even cross minds. Quite sad. take kids Disneyland. exactly right. FDA EMA reference countries others, size regulatory bodies.

What would typically see smaller countries specific requirements physical testing shelf life approval submission, getting toxicity, metabolism, etc. First second dose, groups specifically vaccination willingness?

In Netherlands estimate also mid-July, would willing adults (85% - 90% adults currently) least partially vaccinated. mid-July similar Canada, ""end goal"" might different. fully vaccinated children. They've even made plan vaccinating children, continue current staggering vaccination rate children assuming lower vaccination willingness among children (parent' choice) would less week's work anyways.

The Netherlands averaging around 1.5 administered doses per 100 people per day currently (\~250,000 doses NL = \~550,000 CA). expect stabilise around level, deliveries really increase anymore, demand decrease rate again. rapidly heading towards finish line. vaccinating/inviting one year (age) per year.

In hypothetical I'd put effort vaccination, blame anyone same. I'd still take basic precautions, do, I'd especially careful interacting high risk people. view however, high risk people ones taking precautions, risk life.

&amp;#x200B;

go outside get fresh air. drawing trilobite. Baffling. Whatever could explain peculiar correlation? efficacy vaccine comparison natural immune response, measure vaccine plus natural immune response?

I'm trying pin slimy. Mathematically, 55% ""most"". according governor, process creating system allow businesses easily check vax status, arent gonna make requirement businesses use system Take easy  Genius. Wow. governor typical Republican, believe higher approval among Democrats among Republican voters. .

Vermont also voted Dem wider margin higher percentage votes state 2020 elction.  forgot half sentence: ""...in fucking pandemic."" Yes commented make one point nothing vaccination. course I'm sticking point. bacteria thing, putting words mouth never even insinuated.

Don't like it? Weird that's whole time. Maybe learn it.

Also saying said that, using comparison, insane deny existence varients deny existence viruses bacteria   eventually cards meaningless paper printed on.
Although suppose help jobs/school requires vaccination Interesting people counting unrelated deaths vaccine deaths ones falsely accusing doctors counting unrelated deaths COVID deaths. Shocking.  kids Disneyland. Makes sense Even CDC given community safety enforcement idea told vaccinated safe. days nonsense over.

The risk zero, incredibly small. following would happen:

* breakthrough case happens.
* breakthrough case transmissible.
* grandparents exposed realize sick get tested.
* One grandparents gets breakthrough case.
* breakthrough case becomes severe.
* breakthrough case becomes fatal.

Each item list incredibly unlikely, happen. Notably two instances moderate severe breakthrough case person functioning immune system, incredibly rare. done math, I'm pretty sure we're well ""struck asteroid"" territory, least ""murdered serial killer"". Pretty much!! feel really bad people waited 10 hours April get reservation study compares much better vaccine natural immune response. One doesn‚Äôt lose immune response. 

Again, I‚Äôll break example easy numbers since confusing you. 

Virus morbidity rate 20% infected individuals. 

In study, Virus killed 8 people unvaccinated group two vaccinated. efficacy death prevention 75%. 

For vaccinated individuals Virus morbidity rate 5%. 

20%*.25

If don‚Äôt account natural immunity/efficacy equation morbidity rate would 25%, higher without vaccine.

This say near 100% prevention serious cases deaths. Probably somewhere assuming transmissible. spread would slower assume every person caught Delta variant caught whatever variant dominant. good job, everyone. lets still get 80% 2nd doses too! comment political. all. people overestimate odds Vaccinated people get infected usually asymptomatic light symptoms. Hospitalization death among vaccinated rare getting hit lightning. standard reached long time ago. US many vaccines giving NBA games fans thousands tourists received shots vacation there. Thanks, devil always details. ;) Even article admitted PHE report detailed results opposed anecdotal statement Scottish study. Please see PHE report below. 


In short, vaccines still work.  


PHE found BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine 96 percent effective preventing hospitalization two doses, Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine 92 percent effective hospitalization two doses. 
This based analysis 14,019 cases Delta variant April 12 June 4, 166 hospitalized; Scottish analysis Delta variant drawn 7,723 cases 134 hospitalizations. 
PHE said vaccine efficacy hospitalization Delta variant ‚Äúcomparable‚Äù Alpha variant.  Interesting, wonder science behind this. It‚Äôs illegal ask vaccination proof Florida protect anti-vaxxers freedom fucking morons Considering outside controlled testing none us access data of, children allowed take vaccine, I'm going go limb say full it. That's point I'm trying make, everyone want's attack try make feel guilty wanting take it. ""Leveling off"" implies protection stays same. missing? sarcastic. I'm dodging anything. seem soo hellbent trying make point. care think. bacteria thing, putting words mouth never even insinuated. states passing laws try prevent exactly this, fact. Yes lack accountability destroys healthy public service developing country. Elected officials first fined, last.  stepsister, thing. Granted, never brightest never closest. first post-COVID visit home gonna real interesting. I've already asked mom make sure I'm room alone long enough us strike conversation... *everybody's* peace mind. fucking shit Canada bet bigger Moderna anyone US did, even deliveries skewed.  huge backload meet commitment/target least get close 2nd quarter. Lol Mailmen deliver mail -study finds  Dude even know vaccine status called insane vaccination beliefs. talked beliefs varients made news media. Please try stay topic.

You really seem dodging issue. arguing point never made makes feel better falling victim ridiculous conspiracy theories, live it. Honestly go in, say bacteria viruses real all. going ignore evidence believe one thing might well go whole hog eh?  long Delta doesn‚Äôt cause significant case surge would cause surge hospitalizations deaths, fear either. becoming dominant strain means little cases still trending down, stay flat, even uptick hospitalizations deaths still trend down. now? potentially deadly disease spreading air before. going away. advent easily transmissible variants, seems likely virtually everyone chooses get vaccine infected point near future. may dodged good hygiene good immune system, can't dodge forever. either pick carefully tested proven vaccine, disease killed millions. ought third choice, unfortunately isn't. right forced choose, are.  think US deserves slow clap applause ah, fast posted additional info. 
5 doses per vial, that'd 400 doses 200 people normal assumption don‚Äôt want even fervent deniers die alone

I'm surprised it, bodies need lot work getting antibodies. formula herd immunity (R0-1)/R0. need get point one person gets virus, spread less one new person average.

For R0 6, need get point 5 6 people immune, 84%. vaccine 80% effective, can't get herd immunity vaccination, even vaccinate 100% people. Eventually, 4% people get infected, hit herd immunity. 

In real life, lot harder predict exactly happen since people already infected, get close 100% vaccinated, point virus R0 6 versus vaccine 80% effective means there's going lot virus, long time.

Yeah - talked immunologists figured 21 day (pfizer) 28 day (moderna) delay minimum needed booster would effective.

The *exact fucking logic* Canada used delaying second dose, *also* included seeing body responded antibodies produced.

Yeah that's data works - someone could bad experience vaccine - one data point.

Overall, unless well off, US healthcare system far inferior Canadian system. say someone also lived US (Pasadena, Burbank, Houston, El Paso, Phoenix, know many people waiting months even years get surgery Canada.

Karla Jefferies, 64, tested positive Covid-19 March 2020 bothered puzzling symptoms ever since. First fatigue, fever, taste smell. came brain fog, insomnia, nagging smell something burning intermittent ringing ears.¬†


Hundreds thousands Americans sought medical care post-Covid health problems diagnosed becoming infected coronavirus, according largest study date long-term symptoms Covid-19 patients.


The study, tracking health insurance records nearly two million people United States contracted coronavirus last year, found one month infection, almost one-quarter ‚Äî 23 percent ‚Äî sought medical treatment new conditions.


Those affected ages, including children. common new health problems pain, including nerves muscles; breathing difficulties; high cholesterol; malaise fatigue; high blood pressure. issues included intestinal symptoms; migraines; skin problems; heart abnormalities; sleep disorders; mental health conditions like anxiety depression.


Post-Covid health problems common even among people gotten sick virus all, study found. nearly half patients hospitalized Covid-19 experienced subsequent medical issues, 27 percent people mild moderate symptoms 19 percent people said asymptomatic.



‚ÄúOne thing surprising us large percentage asymptomatic patients category long Covid,‚Äù said Robin Gelburd, president FAIR Health, nonprofit organization conducted study based says nation‚Äôs largest database private health insurance claims.


More half 1,959,982 patients whose records evaluated reported symptoms Covid infection. Forty percent symptoms didn‚Äôt require hospitalization, including 1 percent whose symptom loss taste smell; 5 percent hospitalized.



Ms. Gelburd said fact asymptomatic people post-Covid symptoms important emphasize, patients doctors know consider possibility health issues may actually aftereffects coronavirus. ‚ÄúThere people may even known Covid,‚Äù said, ‚Äúbut continue present conditions unusual health history, may worth investigation medical professional they‚Äôre working with.‚Äù


The report, posted publicly Tuesday morning organization‚Äôs website, analyzed records people diagnosed Covid-19 February December 2020, tracking February 2021. found 454,477 people consulted health providers symptoms 30 days infection. FAIR Health said analysis evaluated independent academic reviewer formally peer-reviewed.



‚ÄúThe strength study really size ability look across range disease severity diversity age groups,‚Äù said Dr. Helen Chu, associate professor medicine infectious diseases University Washington School Medicine, involved report. ‚ÄúThis hard study much data.‚Äù


The report ‚Äúdrives home point long Covid affect nearly every organ system,‚Äù said Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, chief research development service VA St. Louis Health Care System, involved new study.



‚ÄúSome manifestations chronic conditions last lifetime forever scar individuals families,‚Äù added Dr. Al-Aly, author large study published April lingering symptoms Covid patients Department Veterans Affairs health system.


In new study, common issue patients sought medical care pain ‚Äî including nerve inflammation aches pains associated nerves muscles ‚Äî reported 5 percent patients nearly 100,000 people, fifth reported post-Covid problems. Breathing difficulties, including shortness breath, experienced 3.5 percent post-Covid patients.



Nearly 3 percent patients sought treatment symptoms labeled diagnostic codes malaise fatigue, far-reaching category could include issues like brain fog exhaustion gets worse physical mental activity ‚Äî effects reported many people long Covid.


Other new issues patients, especially adults 40s 50s, included high cholesterol, diagnosed 3 percent post-Covid patients, high blood pressure, diagnosed 2.4 percent, report said. Dr. Al-Aly said health conditions, commonly considered aftereffects virus, make ‚Äúincreasingly clear post-Covid long Covid metabolic signature marked derangements metabolic machinery.‚Äù


Relatively deaths ‚Äî 594 ‚Äî occurred 30 days post-Covid, among people hospitalized coronavirus infection, report found.


The study, like many involving electronic records, addressed aspects post-Covid landscape. say patients‚Äô symptoms arose long problems persisted, evaluate exactly infection patients sought help doctors, 30 days more.



The database included people private health insurance Medicare Advantage, uninsured covered Medicare Parts A, B D, Medicaid government health programs. Dr. Chu said people without insurance incomes low enough qualify Medicaid often ‚Äúmore likely worse outcomes,‚Äù findings may understate prevalence post-Covid health problems may represent full picture.


In addition, diagnostic codes electronic records ‚Äúonly good documented provider saw patient,‚Äù said Dr. Chu, co-author smaller study post-Covid symptoms among patients University Washington.


For example, neurological cognitive issues like brain fog may underreported doctors may find appropriate diagnostic code patients may seeking medical help specific issue, FAIR Health said.


It‚Äôs also possible people classified asymptomatic Covid-19 infections developed symptoms tested positive. people received first diagnosis medical issue like hypertension high cholesterol post-Covid might previously issues never sought received treatment.



Another limitation study compare people Covid-19 not, making unclear rates post-Covid symptoms higher general population. Dr. Al-Aly‚Äôs study, made comparison, found one six months becoming infected coronavirus, patients who‚Äôd Covid 60 percent greater risk death 20 percent greater chance needing outpatient medical care people infected.


The FAIR Health report excluded patients certain serious chronic pre-existing conditions like cancer, kidney disease, H.I.V., liver disease stroke researchers said would difficult separate previous health status post-Covid symptoms.


The report explore connections pre-existing conditions patients likelihood developing post-Covid symptoms. said people intellectual disabilities Alzheimer‚Äôs disease dementia greater risk dying 30 days infection.


Overall, experts said, report‚Äôs findings underscore widespread varied nature post-Covid symptoms.


‚ÄúPeople long Covid need multidisciplinary care,‚Äù said Dr. Al-Aly, ‚Äúand health systems adapt reality develop capacity deal patients.‚Äù ""scummy assholes"", then? plenty mysterious strange ""flu"" back Dec. partner struggled last December 4 weeks Texas. figure was. everything including hiring freaking maids, first time lives, clean house, doctors.

If China noticed significant number infections towards end Dec. possible way first transmission started Dec.

I still know origin is, sure original transmission human, wherever was, way December 2019. allowed edit title post would have, sadly needs article title. ... what? 

I Pakistan end May, private hospitals even remaining Sputnik stocks. Bruh come can't hide basements eternity. Get shots move life. vaccines pretty well variants hope find early days spread. articles suggesting already appeared 2020 areas great deal international air travel Asia Italy. San Francisco NYC metro area main ones cited. I'm New Jersey, one article noted couple cases person got positive antibody test early 2021 strange illness end year.

Thanks posting--very curious going here, PRC going tell us. mean people keep working Amazon, restaurants can't seem hire enough people.  Good see they're following ""honor"" system entering test events show proof negative Covid test carry ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù showing fully protected disease. Also, there's real reason take arriving back home.

People complain masks cars operate weird notion masks worn required there's reason keep one otherwise.

In experience, moving mask pocket needed (say, I'm walking grocery store) means mask gets smelly. particularly like that.

It's moot now, since need stores anymore, today, face convenient place carry mask.  Georgia: ""You guys got shut down?"" hope kids vaccine approved winter  bad Japan? What's point? What's testing/positivity rates?

Didn't see article That's harsh this. 2020? Never problem I'm 1%. Sounds like may need find different doctor. Canada we're currently great vaccination front; moment 74% eligible people 1st shot. suggests less vaccine hesitancy many countries. 

Just thinking loud I'm wondering maybe part reason early little access vaccines - frantically trying get one, watching envy countries like UK US ramped efforts quickly. Perhaps created greater sense demand here, fact people get shot even wanted one cases continued explode. remember thinking vaccine like pot gold end rainbow back winter... magic bullet would solve problems, even fathom might turn Canada getting shipments. shots abundant psychology created early still people many eager get it. 

Again, spitballing evidence support experience maybe there's something it. supposed confident going back world diabetic commorbities two pfizers completed 3 months ago? 79% doesnt seem strong. worked guy went AWS annual conference Vegas December '19. convinced got COVID conference. it?  fall likely/possible people Israel USA need third shot. vaccine production flattens 3 4 billion doses per year means large sections globe getting vaccinated. long term 7 billion dose per year long term production plan.

""should be"" wishful thinking. much capacity, build fast, trying.

If large sections globe getting vaccinated, large section globe getting vaccinated. first goal always enough anyone needs dose first. government, particularly democratic one, always prioritize people foreign nation, particularly life &amp; death situation like covid.

""it cheaper attack Covid19 globally""

The logic follow. need certain % reach herd immunity. spread vaccine out, place it. best strategy concentrate vaccination least need herd immunity regions. 

Unless make enough, hope do, doubt it, evenly spread vaccination whole world. recipe making sure place reaches herd immunity. Sure, someone choose excess vaccines go, beyond pay grade. keep wearing mask, many people variety reasons CA longer mask distancing requirements finally! Still optional businesses require, high volume indoor venues still must require masks, many workers various fields still required, sensible enough. 95% efficacy means every 20 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would.

It's like 4:1 J&amp;J certain variants.

So still probably sitting next unvaccinated sick guy day avoid it. FFS, every time think, ‚ÄúOK, numbers getting better, risk come down, look many people even hear OK now, let guard go thing miss doing‚Äù nope, fucking COVID. Read rest person's comments. KNOW world ending, ended already, nothing it.  VARIANT! known due people got sick shortly New Year celebrations. friends got terribly sick weeks days New Years. thought slippery slope too, anti-vaxxer folks seem make connection decisions serious social costs really need face directly. levers incentivize seem place, makes difference. anything seem even entrenched.

Slippery slope suppose said couch potatoes eating Standard American Diet forming bulk US medical costs form heart disease obesity related issues. However, getting people spend 15 mins go get shot seems like much lower barrier. Also increases risk superbugs emerging ala MRSA. there's virus unaffected ethanol, we're really fucked would seriously consider therapeutic intervention fascinating hear about, think many suspected this. I've heard anecdotes people got ""flu"" retroactively suspected COVID instead. even coworker thought got early on, saying fatigued ever felt getting sick. bit shame got caught guard like that. Fucking scum earth. think nobody ever know dose virus got. confer robust immune response since full virus contains epitopes spike protein vaccines 

is unknown point. That's vaccine trials measure dose response dose. Umm chemicals aren‚Äôt good us? country runs underpaying disadvantaged workers cheap imports. big corps pay lowest salaries make highest profit possible.

There nothing new shocking, attacking amazon alone completely missing boat. whats really shocking, bought stupid POS trickle lie since 1980s. Let's stay bubbles entire lives lmao 

I'm U.S., visited U.K., spent much adult life India. genuinely delusional think ""less fortunate"" Britain living like rural poor Chhattisgarh Bihar. 

People Bastar jungles, instance, running water, reliable electrical connections, toilets. Many walk half-day sell tendu leaves forest produce local markets. get extorted Forest Department, bullied Maoist guerrillas, almost completely ignored government. 

Sure, people West rough. many ""poor"" people countries like still Nike shoes iPhones, live buildings basic amenities. 

Literally incomprehensible sheltered think this. number total population. Israel also still restrictions mask mandates point. also vaccine passports system. lot different factors. limitation study compare people Covid-19 not, making unclear rates post-Covid symptoms higher general population.

&amp;#x200B;

... seems like useful study then? mean get infected, 2 dose AZ regimen 8% chance go hospital? mean odds going hospital 92% lower unvaccinated people?

What odds unvaccinated? uncle (my mother's youngest brother) contracted COVID January year able recover. However, continued suffer long hauler symptoms, least everyone thought long hauler symptoms. turns out, flu symptoms also early warning sign Leukemia. Unfortunately, diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia, may well COVID masked symptoms.

Long story short, COVID, keep eye lingering symptoms, particularly history smoking.  guarantee healthcare, actual food water insecurity means starvation thirsting(why water equivalent?) death real possibility, maybe get lucky get dsyentry Certain hostile states people like creating chaos destabilising society. ""She says examine samples prior Jan. 2, 2020. But, add data prior study CDC indicating Americans may infected December 2019."" Nothing confirmed. spreading China November, easily possible stray cases made places spread aggressively yet. seems virus slowly getting better spreading, supports.  Yeah, type people aren‚Äôt vaccinated don‚Äôt even like vacations lol. work oilfield mostly conservatives vast majority would rather blow money guns, ATVs, trucks, divorce attorneys, etc take proper vacation, especially involves leaving US smart move though. new variants coming different parts world. they're vaccinating strict order age reason uptake high every bracket. also actually higher supply countries. months ago, used give much population first dose ""have"" use much new supply second doses. favor banning firearms name public safety?  Unlike Chinese, Slavs aren‚Äôt racial group. lmao 

I lived India adult life. cannot compare ""poverty"" UK poverty India. People rural Chhattisgarh Jharkhand living fucking reed huts without electricity, running water, toilets, walk day sell tendu leaves gathered produce local markets. 

Meanwhile, ""poor"" Brits subsidized health care iPhones. already evidence this? thought Seattle Flu study showed already. Good point ... unless also refused wear mask whilst behaving like selfish clod.  Meanwhile, Australia. Muchas gracias!! :) Thanks looking bright side. think right! really, seeing vocal minority also people say one thing another. sure downvoted seems general consensus among thais least. know flatly refuse get free chinese vaccine instead willing wait pay moderna/pfizer become available, also desirable, might open Siam Bioscience manufactured AZ/Oxford vaccine widely rolled out. 100% effective hospitalization. 96% getting sick virus. vaccines 100% getting hospitalization... Even J&amp;J Haha, idea...probably never UK. 

I've never say...Africa, seen India Myanmar, bad man, real bad. Nothing like ever seen.

Imagine one toilet thousands people. gets dirty cholera starts spreading really fast.

Imagine air every day equivalent smoking three packs day.

Imagine time eat meat unwashed food run risk spilling guts out

I could go on... Mayor ""accident""? That‚Äôs lot English fans watch England choke finals! supply sitting around

Do we? :| Every time see 'back day, things better' comments Facebook, draw attention women allowed vote certain coloured people even classified humans.

You'd think they'd notice obvious irony no, take bait say 'yeah miss good old days.'

Oh well, they'll dead soon we'll new generation degens deal with.  can't determine trend two data points.  first point - much UK relied much main option UK could produce locally therefore going form majority doses regardless bets. 
The options AZ/Pfizer basically supplied &lt; 1m doses together far (Moderna) factory UK producing Novavax yet applied approval due delays production. 

This say UK **ordered** lot vaccines yet **received** lot them.

Heres hoping free return travel enjoying August (hopefully sooner)! Right, communicable diseases bad covid. kind situation now. Since Regeneron Eli Lilly mca's FDA approved, wonder test results better AZ mca?  Vaccines still tremendously effective variants. long people get shot, we're good shape virus keeps changing. Remember wasn‚Äôt airborne originally? US never able help anyone get pandemic control keep control. started donating got vaccination here, that's coincidence. nation going help others fire. limitation study compare people

Meaningless study. Next. working musician popular, densely crowded restaurant Chicago attracts lot tourists, foreign domestic. December, 2019, spouse came nasty, nagging coughs respiratory problems. go doctor, spouse did. got inhaler, really much good. 4 weeks, issues disappeared.

Point is, I'll forever wonder one early ones - ultimately lucky ones - infected. never thought get tested, less became shut-ins. wish tested got ""jab"". restaurant opens full capacity today, we're still staffing floor 50% capacity. going bloodbath while.  incorrectly assuming every surface touch contaminated post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

This could noise.  That's like 200 9/11s seems plausible original Covid less transmissible later variants. look new variants done way even transmissible every new variant, seems possible weaker variant could spreading world wide Chinese outbreak. know several people horrible respiratory infection December/January including wife daughter.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yes, vaccinated people still like 95% chance get minimal symptoms henceforth properly immune variant.  16+ eligible Vermont since April 19. meant 2019 2020. days years blending one another. remind statistical risk covid poses young children? feel need judge adults fun? seems awfully insensitive platform like Reddit communities people basically interests, fandoms, etc. enjoying hurting anyone else, see problem here. California also opened today Honestly sure, allergist recommended waiting Novavax I‚Äôm also young, healthy, still able strictly socially distance. others differing situations though guess J&amp;J another option well Yeah ‚Ä¶ took yet another lockdown :(

It‚Äôs 12 months past since met virus still using control strategies start ‚Ä¶ muppets responsible prob get re-elected.  Yup studies showing Pfizer 96% effective hospitalization 92% AZ Gotta get clicks. Please understand corruption part everyday life India. saying right just, people living streets, garbage streets, nasty air pollution, normal. People taken precautions countries India since beginning, know anything sanitation, physically impossible way cities structured. them, attending large religious ceremony worse getting Covid, ""karmic consequences"" worse. bathe Ganges river, often classified one dirtiest rivers world. West. typical Indian person give fuck Covid. good economy well since Mexico top trading partner. helps herd immunity too, since Americans frequently travel Mexico.  Sometimes forget I'm wearing it, especially windy/cold outside. hard say ""California, first state close due COVID, reopens today.' It‚Äôs possible, knows? shouldn‚Äôt be. Edit: clarify mean vaccines mandatory barring legitimate medical exemptions. Oh, sure. stopped caring. I'm vaxxed. people know vaxxed. aren't, plan it. So, that's choice. mean CDC? sufficient one later test positive antibody test.

What dose virus think necessary? Thanks, thought people could get J&amp;J one? Thanks - go hunt thankfully thought scroll did. efficacy AZ Indian variant still unknown, since adequate trial done. trials far measure efficacy 2 weeks second dose, due PHE tracking data past months, know AZ seems take longer work Pfizer. May AZ Pfizer 85-90% effective two doses Alpha, exceeding clinical trials case AZ. need vaccinate people Israel, need give AZ time work. PHE predict AZ 65-90% effective Indian variant two doses. We're also still quite way behind Israel terms vaccinating young people, main spreaders, due general lack supply.  Color shock never said better anyone else, also I'm open completely wrong. 

My parents got vaccinated tell trust it. going stop taking it, would've felt guilty end wrong. 

I think toxic everyone pro vaccine try guilt people want take it. continue reddit threads reassuring vaccines good, attacking people think different you, go outside, get sun exercise, actually lower chances getting sick/dying. 

Don't categorize everyone anti vaccine crazy conspiracy theorist, cause that's stupid. Thankfully kids much immune IIRC. Still good expose it, it‚Äôs better usual antivax scenario. happening? No.

What article says concept* mrna vaccine around 30 years. sars cov2 vaccines specifically. important difference.

Consider concept ‚Äúnormal‚Äù vaccine around 100‚Äôs years possible formulate unsafe version those...

Show decade-long double blind placebo controlled safety study Pfizer / moderna vaccine, humans, I‚Äôll get jabbed hell it.

Until then, ok people decide tech new / unproven want bodies. Maybe don‚Äôt require everyone come back too. know people use office refuge home, hell don‚Äôt even like work home 5 days week. also don‚Äôt enjoy commuting, stuck traffic 2 hours every day, wake unnecessarily early. 

Hybrid work weeks sweet spot, opinion. Jesus devil! tears came me, mama!  care point able get away live finally going back college (haven‚Äôt enrolled anywhere since spring 2020) playing sports again. Delta variant chance disrupt that? 

I go college rural area northwestern Pennsylvania, helps inform answer. Oh FFS maths. Citizens US essentially back living normal lives. Canadians not. US **multiple** months ahead Canada. Crushing pandemic means returning back normal soon possible cases continue go down. Canada certainly that, least compared US. still take get full approval. 

Which will, safe effective.   Wait‚Ä¶.vaccines‚Ä¶work???? could foreseen outcomes??? someone possesses density dying star impossible reason them. 

What earth think later clinical trials measuring? vaccine safety, difference infection rates outcomes unvaccinated vaccinated. experience way around. Canadians insecure misidentified American resort wearing Maple Leafs whenever go out. Facebook say Yes, understand math. point 1/4 total vaccine doses Canada needs end pandemic. Enough everyone got AZ first dose get Moderna booster - next week. everyone first dose get one. 

The pandemic Canada (like Israel) 3 
 weeks. Four most. takes 12 days mRNA first dosing dramatic reduction contagiousness.  Many anti vaxxers anti doctor allopathic medicine general. friend majorly Chinese medicine Ayurvedic medicine. allopathic bad guy. Honestly 3 positives negatives nuance lost stupid people.  thanks washing post (owned Jeff Bezos Amazon makes 60 billion year someting)!!!!!!!  AZ efficacy goes 92% doses, moot point ever increasing number Brits getting fully vaccinated. short-term problem resolve rather quickly anyone think actually get 70% US vaccinated end year? think reason restricting outdoor events event indoor areas event (less issue able half time pint football) transport to/from ground. would many people say contagious?  make sense. contagious, really common. mutates contagious form, that's one tracked spread of? People thought wasnt? remember antibody tests wildly inaccurate. probably means amount people acquired immunity covid infection even higher reported. really? states going back normal implement mask wearing unvaccinated (via honor system)
They (CDC) also alerted regarding RSV. Could actually Delta variant? 
Yes would love toss mask away, keep wearing take precautions. (This post mostly opinion , feel free best you)  believe something doesn‚Äôt exist likely due meme saw somewhere want call people names?  would number hospitalization even blip contagious? Happy birthday birthday buddy! Middle month, middle date birthday King county TX absolutely abysmal vaccination rates (14.88% 12+ fully vaccinated, even 65+ 15.69% fully vaccinated) curiosity looked - King county second Republican county entire country 2016. extreme rurality help vaccine access, politics angle pretty hard ignore. much harder shelter quarantine people require additional medical attention well likely live group settings like retirement homes. also seen lot people would assume likely spread it, eager get vaccine. need hope minimal Nothing - premise ""I paid mine everyone else too"".

Which I'm bitching since got vaccine incentive, everyone else too. Even though end good people getting them, I'm jealous get free stuff cases Literally number looking could find article.

totally pointless study without control group. Whoah even. Became really sick right Disneyland exact dates Explain keep hearing third deaths England right fully vaccinated people?  True, Russia leader take vaccine secret, refuse disclose vaccine was, several months later say Sputnik V.

I'm aware Trump also received one secretly actually believe got vaccine said did, unlike Putin. Greek alphabet like 'extra' Atlantic basin hurricanes year implemented 2nd list need names. There‚Äôs huge difference 71% 96% plus difference preventing symptomatic infection Pfizer vs AZ. Canada isn‚Äôt screwed single dose strategy primarily mRNA, UK screwed mainly using inferior product inferior dosing strategy. 

The UK less 1000 cases one point wonders exponential growth mean change fast too, fella Yeah point anecdotally, seems like there's discrepancy contagious seemed vs number hospitalizations. Changing contagious disease became explain many people said got initially. mom antivax lives NC (I'm NY). messaged antivax bs article responded vaccination card. Power move recommend take look opposite. Announced yesterday changing 8 weeks. Wow. Yeah important looking state state. don‚Äôt always scheduling pair give said overly optimistic news   Man would hate piece metal town right now. that.... specific study posted indicates nine 24,000 samples went back checked positive Covid back 2019 timeline.

So chances incredibly small people Covid.  

It‚Äôs possible, extremely unlikely. Could possible vaccinate bats bat caves aerosolised vaccine endemic viruses? total 35 cases North Queensland since pandemic began.    Yes, trying reduce seriously constrained supply mean plenty people get crazy flu's put work week require hospitalization dr's visits, think everyone's latching onto people normal sicknesses going, yup covid alright First all, discussed state POPULATION size. Second all, can‚Äôt compare population 650,000 state 40 million. Hypothetically, wouldn‚Äôt mean much say Wyoming population 5 people. 5 vaccinated, first state 100% vaccinated Eff around find lol  TN mask mandate. gov made recommendations, nothing required. left choice city's county's, ton mandates. Yeah that‚Äôs feel sometimes anxiety. could see doctor EKG, might ease mind? Californian spent years Vermont, really great see. surprised, either. state full genuinely nice caring people I've ever come across. downvoted it, agenda nice day Please tell joke comment. idiots like take much longer recover covid.  
Hey look places covid rates down, let travel across country covid hotspot fuck up. 80% first dose eligible population, fully vaccinated population. say article never discussed state size.

You're fucking liar. Everyone look one post, unless going delete edit it. can‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs much easier state like Vermont get 80% vaccinated compared another state like NY, CA, Texas, many others.

Yes, deny it. there's truth it.  2021-06-15 Vaccination demographics update

Source: [CDC vaccination demographic Excludes Texas (\~9% US). Historic Vaccination Data link page often updates sooner chart. Yes brain fart. Thanks correction. per capita comparison correct however. actually started anxiety subreddit, comment someone saying someone know bad blood clot. much getting anxiety support lol. scare bc sounds like coincidence instead vaccine related clot. I'm waiting wave anxiety pass. risk small feel safe. want know really happens I'll able tell apart anxiety, like can't trust body :/ told guy shared actual lived experience crawl rock. hurt happy? can‚Äôt nice? people may different life experiences you‚Äôre still kind one another. Gotcha, found source age here. Looks like 50-65+ \~66% \~78% fully partially vaccinated, respectively, that's good. 18-49 lags \~50% \~61% fully partially vaccinated, respectively. Better thought sure, still behind Vermont here. Makes sense bigger state maybe. anxious get 70% fully vaccinated across board  mind frying think really. Like, entire next generation literally breeze without vaccine without serious precautions protecting them. Seriously? we're handling them? Great news reopening day! data UK yesterday showed 71% efficacy hospitalization Delta *one* dose AZ, 96% PfizerBNT. Trying claim UK screwed simply baseless. Plus Canada took strategy cases falling cliff provinces, less 1000 cases nationally reported today. dont get people still wanting restrict outside events countries high vaccination rates. gap first second dose UK? still 12 weeks? shit????? proud state sister (in 20's) got back March. fine. day fever, another day tiredness, perfectly fine.

Don't worry. blood clot risk really small; might've higher risk getting crash driving get shot. Weekend reporting, mind you, *very good* news nonetheless. Great, even French Canadians come south leave trash Mt Mansfield I‚Äôm sure consider severe side effects, there‚Äôs decent chance might feel headache, fever, chills 12 hours off. 

Hot bath Tylenol ought set straight there‚Äôs side effects. team work younger least side effects, gone next day don‚Äôt worry COVID anymore! Two ok vaccines behind ramping production Bruhh going gym without mask feels sooo weird. face feels naked lol. (i'm california btw ) so? customer yell us make scene asking wear mask came inside, fucker ended stealing customer‚Äôs smoothie running out. seriously don‚Äôt understand hard wear mask 2 minutes. still somewhat effective, right? living nasal passages short time frame, infected.  places are, Florida. year healthcare premiums going way conservative coworkers blaming Joe Biden yet average hospital stay covid like 30 40k.  vaccine $50.  even monoclonal antibodies (which won‚Äôt educate about) much cheaper. two friends could said, covid positive, comorbidities, find us clinic give us monoclonals today would 75-80% less likely chance would go hospital. 

So much money health wasted reason. it‚Äôs done ‚Äúprolife‚Äù ‚Äúfiscally responsible‚Äù crowd. Yes‚Ä¶ last summer, now. 
Assume mean southern states USA south Europe Southern Hemisphere? South America? given hard hit first wave, they'll extremely high level immunity even compared heavily vaccinated populations. asking discount story, believe find interesting. wonder there's genetic link there. know adults, families wipes families get away symptoms.  Question CADPH personnel‚Ä¶

Is California sequencing every positive hospitalization Ct &lt; 31 ?  Seems like good vaccine. Russia's fault f\*\*\*\*ing shady less half population trusts now. OK...but live America plenty health care experience chronic condition needed attention since 5 years old. Like said - problem I've had. doctor busy job properly, fire find another. population receive second dose well? think probably rather live near people issue getting vaccine. would probably pay premium so. Hopefully rest state follows logic. know fatality rate Delta variant is? know say transmissible, word much (if all) deadly is? really hope missed /s. People still actually thinking reminds see people post facebook scams say ""facebook begin selling pictures unless copy past exactly written below!"" Another good sign despite Delta rising Ontario, overall case counts still going down. Love lots,

-from NJ sucks. curious effective (if all) expired doses are. Good question - OP-101 synthetic polymer nanoparticle, parts really cheap &amp; manufacturing anywhere near cost complex biologics. However, first instance type nanoparticle used clinical trials, might bit expensive (although still biologic expensive) first couple batches. get blood test see infected, make sure testing nucleocapsid proteins spike (you'll get spike proteins vaccine). AZ still significant pro ability stored indefinitely refrigerator temperatures. Logistically makes better pick poorer rural places worldwide (like Vietnam!).

Novavax exciting too. also stored indefinitely refrigerator temperatures highly effective. Hopefully give boost vaccination effort around globe. 80% number specifically 1st dose I'm going able get second dose due reaction first. I've monitored antibody levels since got first jab February, recently last week antibodies still increasing. I'm wondering second dose may necessary all. 5 days begin with. double 10 days quarantine period travellers UK fully vaccinated, joining growing list countries imposing stricter travel rules British arrivals due concerns rapid spread Delta variant.

Also prevents kids vectors, infecting immunocompromised people contributing community spread.

The vaccines experimental anymore - first trials year ago, they've given hundreds millions people safely now, proving extremely safe, well effective.

Doctors overwhelmingly recommending vaccinating kids. really need know. Real-ass doctors medical degrees decades experience saying vaccinate kids. Listen doctors. wish could send ours. enough plenty people would rather end permanent lung damage die get vaccinated. honestly deservers break year hard work Except weather! healthcare facilities mandating employees beyond me. believe medication science, work healthcare."
