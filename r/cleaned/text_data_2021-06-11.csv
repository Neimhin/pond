In addition excellent responses already received wanted call statement out. numbers last year, even point, likely substantial undercount due limited number tests. CTV barely credible news organization. It’s step Fox News dozens steps CBC, NPR NY Times.

They’ve fallen far days Lloyd Robertson anchoring national news. went cycling day second shot. Thank god I'm 68! /s one checking vaccine cards NY... see would reason fake one. Aside that, majority people vaccinated, cares people choose get risk health safety? choice. becoming screeching obnoxious topic. basically past pandemic, everyone needs get back living lives stop worrying much people. end day, live free country actions truly control own. stop trying control others focus yourself. prefer mRNA immunity? 

The people help fear needles children. It’s wonderful development. That’s incredibly admirable wife… thank efforts. try thing promoting books. die micheal Gregor. lot people don’t read books anymore. 

So doesn’t anger you? system fails… still resources make food choices affordable, easy make, extremely healthy grocery stores never come fruition… lobbyists big corpa keep way… cause ya know profits? That’s system! Yet scapegoat frustrations merely pointing reality rather real merchants change simply kept things status qou. 

Wouldn’t great Heart disease sub exist get much traction covid subs response? roadblock standard ""rules regulations expiration dates"", border closure. Canadians would happily drive across get leftover vaccines evening allowed quarantine two weeks afterwards. There's obvious solution here. Congrats taking data context

The risk minuscule within context second doses modern needles good hardly hurt anymore. change happened last years.

Now feels like someone tapped shoulder prick all.

Blood draws tests still use thicker needles still hurt, last flu shots covid shots basically painless.

However there’s tons propaganda dis-information Covid-19. there’s people like feel it’s fear mongering warn reality disease, double non-existent “what xyz” without even looking fact fighting xyz years. know fears like irrational say vaccine jab MUCH less bad e.g. gettig blood drawn. tiny tiny needle like ml substance. looked way (not big fan needles either ) honestly didnt even notice already happened it’s not. Unemployment rate based survey, whether you’re getting benefits.  Taco Bell employees getting hero pay day? don’t envy them..! We've really done pathetic job  differences beyond % vaccinated.

The USA opened vaccines age groups. UK we've going age groups demand outstripping supply, days ago 25-year-olds made eligible.

This means 18-24 year olds vaccinated (except vulnerable) UK, whereas people age group jabs USA. Many early-20s American friends vaccines.

So wonder UK exponential growth non-vaccinated age group socialises lot amongst people age group. immunity amongst young people.

The question is: matter young people catching it? justify lockdowns restrictions? many Australia still believe Govt keep us zero Covid. Federal election due May 2022.

The cases rising quickly age groups would expect country removed nearly COVID restrictions subset population immunity socialise together.

The big question whether matters. Perhaps matter young people get virus, long vulnerable old already vaccinated? Lol Why? What’s going Brazil? Relax stay home. thought mostly 16-19 year old males. work regulatory affairs read FDA warning letters weekly basis. letter really damning! 

Thanks posting link!   Nah, don’t think so, said expect non-vaccinated people keep wearing masks   says need card? fake it?

Hint: J&amp;J interested seeing data published. Cases rising amongst young people. need keep going young vaccinated too, faster possible. also remote possibility vaccine resistant variants, case might need stockpile enough doses third booster jab. 

I think we're going see much significant vaccine generosity time. Every country looking protect economies.  I'm sure that's clear right way think comparison. wikipedia article nothing "" surge pneumonia flu-like cases December ""

Incredibly frustrating worked. “While AstraZeneca’s vaccine showed studies almost 100 per cent effective protecting death Covid-19 variants, efficacy mild moderate illness beta variant, first identified South Africa, 22 per cent. mutation found Seychelles.”


We know Chinese vaccine isn’t effective vaccines seems narrative Seychelles cases increasing. Curious see information given AZ effectiveness vs Beta variant absolutely vaccine card, trying defend law breaking here. I’ve worked New York government seen plays out. talks bit - personally felt needle got shot didn’t hurt EU's rolling QR based passport, either app printout/card Also, no, case.  study demonstrates probable lifelong immunity natural infection. Vaccination likely improves this. Vaccination alone show immune cell ""programming"" bone marrow.

Practically means:
Those covid natural immunity enhanced vaccination. likely need boosters.
Those covid need boosters throughout life.

We can't wear masks entire lives. quit wearing unless I'm doctor's office somewhere sick likely be. surely nothing fact already lazy, unhealthy society closed year now. swear we’re addicted masks. People walk street alone wearing them. suppose downvoted simply read article instead asking ""What happened?"". long mandatory prison time, doesn’t matter long is. 1 month 1 year 10 years: can’t imagine deterrence effect much different kind crime. Even short stint prison ruinous. kind mortality rate might cause services like waste management, sewage treatment, water treatment food supplies collapse would magnify death rate consequences world urbanized work required everyone vaccinated send photos cards. 

Otherwise, anyone ask see it. That's big concession say COVID less risky one vaccines demographic (assuming demographic plainly allergic vaccine ingredient). ...Why? That's waste everything. fucking fine done it, need lock people up. Holy fuck.  missing something? mean vaccine ~35% efficiency rate? Since total percentage people fully vaccinated 45%? Lol  makes scientific report us West credible one China? 

Do know China works? know absolutely nothing said CCP? know people use VPN's CCP monitors traffic, social media accounts everything post online? get caught saying bad things devastating consequences due social credit system? even know social credit system ruin life?

That's makes West credible China. ability real discussion, like one perhaps places life. transmissible means people infected shorter time period.

The peak higher, wave burns quicker Hmm lived upstate could regional. 

A related thread: case wasn’t clear mean auto pump clips. remember people would recommend tennis balls instead, much less safer. Yet variant hysteria. mRNA vaccines cover least 23 epitopes.  masks coming safe think I'm going get big vaccination flag show everyone protected know kidding, UK people 25 currently offered vaccine (as well anyone existing health conditions).

So introducing vaccine passports essentially making illegal 18-24s socialise. age discrimination.

When consider 18-24s perhaps given least risk, seems unfair create system specifically restricting lives.  wondered something like happening. close eyes turn head. barely feel anything way. start off, I've pissy clickbait titles, vaccine front, meant trying stuff anyone runs types headlines, sorry misunderstood, I'd love try get stop.

That said, they've done this, conversation. I'd love say think anti Vax people use it. already seen ones sphere use already, reddit, scary headline information. sucks, scary headline side talking, lot people get scary headline messaging.  Agreed, know misinformation there, might good question bring front. mRNA vaccines Moderna Pfizer 6 ingredients, different past vaccines based DNA.

Thank you. fully vaccinated still following precautions. Either way, haven’t asked produce vax card anywhere. vaccinated going get ill.

The bad news rhe unvaccinated. real breakthrough variant occurs, unvaccinated would risk again.

However number breakthrough cases among vaccinated currently low yet seem big problem.

Potentially virus next years could change, might cause mild cold even vaccinated people. unvaccinated risk again, since could spread around freely again. 

I think happen quickly. rise Delta/Indian variant UK notable. Maybe AztraZeneca vaccin used mostly UK susceptible breakthrough variants? Yes 51% effectivenessfor lose! extremely low risk vaccines. I'm sure countries almost vaccines would like them, risk all. experience, tell delaying reopening much better continuing crippled covid superspreaders also (I hope larger) number people Idioting, legit hesitant vaccines. talk it, anti Vax people will, hesitant people see one side lying, least talking it. anti Vax side going nuanced fair either. talk shutting clickbaits. titles nothing support anti-vax.

The problem promote sorts articles all. Imagine article titled “Evidence grows stronger Covid vaccine linked mild, self-resolving issue, CDC says”. would pro-vax, rather underwhelming, closer end result. much discourse article really generate? 118 comments vs many title reads, panicking, people holding vaccination 2 months nothing?

The posters seem mindset must talk terms exaggerate anti-vax, all. nothing talking terms pro-vax, reasonable representation risk? due many people misled discussion whatsoever, order preference fair discussion, pro-vax, shut it, anti-vax hysteria. reality, India far far ahead.

My sympathy level low anyone eligible chose get it... except kids (and super small set people actually can't take vax). 
  
I think reasonable precautions still make sense. Like, wife (fully vax'd) went take son haircut. masks there, state 39% adults fully vax'd. Amazing many people happened full vax. Sure fine people hair salon lie. more. threaten steal car unless let borrow it, would say voluntarily lending it?

After nobody holding forcing give keys. suspect it’s downvoted people think it’s asked bad faith. point, seriously doubt someone lacking information regarding question unless they’re willfully ignorant already certain get vaccine. It’s possible, I’d guess often not, it’s legitimate question. 

I don’t think need get high mighty defending question. It’s okay done people asking things. also don’t see issue encouraging vaccination regardless circumstance. Everyone eligible isn’t within tiny percentage population get vaccine. reasons state, it’s obvious choice regardless circumstance. Canada certainly great vaccination right now, new supplies moderna huge boost.

However, amused statement article According data collated University Oxford-based World Data, Canada ranks first globally terms share population least one dose vaccine, surpassed previous leader Israel yesterday.

This actually true. authors go website, look default chart shows subset ""notable"" countries, saw Canada top these. 

However, go actual website (linked below), click chart, sort share population one dose June 10th, see still several regions still ahead Canada. British overseas territories like (St. Helena, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, etc.) could argued ""don't count"". still 4 independent countries ahead Canada first doses according source: San Marino, Nauru, Seychelles, Malta. 

All small countries, still Sinovac's true potential might 3 dose 0,1,6 schedule though, like lot innactivated vaccine disease..  actual papers saying whether you’ve passed GCEs, completed course university. yeh shit show Right?!! thinking like people thing science elements magic. threw billions dollars resources greatest minds it.

It’s tricky because, Europe, people still opportunity get vaccinated. live Germany half people know *really* want get vaccinated aren’t enough appointments moment. It’s like US people unvaccinated ones choose so. still, wearing mask hurt anyone like said, see harm wearing one cold/flu season. I'm also telling anyone else wear one, I'm saying, people want that, that's fine. good deal world care community also want take sick days.  Two questions: antibodies // immunity stand recent variants? ...and affect reinfection therefore transmission?

More broadly-- overall differences infected receiving vaccine? Fucking charlatan!! take lot undo damage done. Agreed. silly. idea fear needles stopping people ridiculous. Like stubbing toes real good 5+ times year hurts way more.

Meanwhile take crowded 40 minute train ride work another one back. catch Covid, I’m likely die. vaccine though. 

Oh, also, work schools. Definitely misnomer - events nightclubs stage it? Take deep breath, blow out, shot blow out. focuses breath dont notice needle much.

Indeed.

Especially ORDERED vaccines first still fulfilled. 

I learned (since posted) country finally got Pfizer vaccines week starting weekend, they'll available exclusively 12-17 year olds (since that's one approved age range). literally first allotment. 230k vaccines. much all.

&amp;nbsp;


So, recap, 10 million astrazeneca (first deal signed) become 0 deliveries far. 

&amp;nbsp;

2nd deal, 8 million pfizer, become 230k...finally June 11th. 

&amp;nbsp;

3rd deal signed late, Sinovac,has delivered around 5 million shots. since Last week February June.

&amp;nbsp;

Covax Initiative delivered around 800k astrazeneca vaccines delivered small amounts March June (technically, small batch every month). 

&amp;nbsp;

It ain't much something. way ""choice"". 

&amp;nbps;

Now US filled around 5-6 months UK used ton astrazeneca shots...now things starting get rolling. Here’s article without scaremongering.

Every illiterate person cannot survive without phone Pakistan. It’s like Oxygen. confirm. people see still carrying mask around wearing still around others, even walking street. Long pandemic hit, exactly unusual see people mask. 

This changes depending neighborhood extent, really big deal wear mask.  fact, Russians dumb. problem much complex sheer stupidity. include undocumented, homeless? something like bodily integrity, get vaccinated enjoy life follow later doubts start go away. took thousands years get level rights bodies, let's ditch fast. whole summer convince people get vaccinated. Russian, probably wouldn’t trust government either dog acts like I've abandoned forever gone hours top that, keep mind twice announced it’s over. last time xmas another 40k people died. september school opened totally safe, 20k people died.

let’s see top 40k “post covid” period. 
As 2019 San Francisco population 874,000. Pretty sure 800,000 left past year, especially much traffic's picked city.

Best numbers I've seen entire Bay Area seem decline roughly 0.12% past year, mostly inland toward Tracy Sacramento, buy houses roughly 1/2 2/3 cost home Bay Area. Biggest new selling point listings home offices.

But sure thing, keep trying convince absolute hell hole here. Maybe maybe convince another fraction percent people move sell homes become slightly affordable, maybe averaging 1.1 million instead 1.3 million would nice. left Disney last week, still heavily enforcing masks (in indoor areas) regardless vaccination status. I’m beyond relieved timing. Israel 125 doses/person pandemic end - actually seems ended ago, possibly around 1/person. using pfizer likely lot higher sterilizing immunity vectored inactivated vaccines.

On interesting end, Bhutan (small, poor country) given 0.6-0.65 doses per person, giving every adult one AZ dose seemingly problems far Delta wave that's overtaken every adjacent country. pandemic probably ""over"" there, although high protective immunity might be. what’s going backfire hard soon… signals it’s saying otherwise “fear mongering”…  bet summer okay (if great) next December find really got vaccine.

That’s happened last year. found holding indoor mask less gatherings thanksgiving. you’re looking death? they’re consistently hovering around 15-25% daily cases.

just people don’t test anymore doesn’t mean it’s spreading. 

cases HALVING weekly 35k 300-400 change behavior population pretty good giveaway something off. Covid also mostly spread symptoms present. Children show covid symptoms also staying home.

Did think children wear mask protect seasonal flu 2 years ago? uptake issue, then? Uh dropped restrictions New York Memorial Day... think looking upside down, it’s actually alt right. super informative. Thank taking time this. Btw Pakistan, India. Ah good perspective makes even disappointing happens. hope people realize importance vaccines, ever, despite headlines like told cannot take vaccine illness symptoms kind. call center first things ask you. Plus temp ask leave. need ship them? Stop protecting patents, simple. They're over-compensating.  tell someone afraid spiders suck up

Maybe (although suck face fears I've front of), would tell find trick get that's fucking important. Hospital transmission something control now.. bet unvaccinated staff member spread virus. like nursing homes. Wait think someone says governments produce things, means saying government magically produces it? 

You realize corporations contract production well? J&amp;J issues plant contracted vaccines. wasn’t state backed contractor, one facilities part network. 

Governments waiting corporation make vaccine governments ability force production business capable unwise. 

WW2 perfect example. didn’t wait one company make tanks, planes, made everyone make them. fair every Russian dumb. Source: Russian live US think need 10 Billion shots administered end pandemic. Now, easily produce much vaccines end year; problem distributing actually convincing people take them. probably aware UK number cases rise again. think assume unvaccinated less vulnerable as, like pointed out, vulnerable mostly vaccinated.

These people less likely severe symptoms, become brewing beds give lots chances covid mutate long R0 1 (as case UK). Mutations lead new variants, need one deadly variant created cause sorts problems even vaccinated.

Passports hopefully keep R0 &lt; 1 couple months move towards zero number new cases. Dead virus = chance mutate. Kind like Israel right now.

The way see it, covid passport implementation successful last probably 3 4 months tops? Israel given us perfect example (even though exactly use passport.. they?) virtually zero new case, ready fully open.

With countries joining club, covid free bubble formed rather quickly.. countries join bubble, u covid free world.

Sounds ideal? enough people less selfish get vaccinated quickly and/or comply passport rules months, hope day come. pool show id/check lifeguards, yes can.

I complain, open pool last summer.  knowledge flu virus mostly spread symptoms present. Children show flu symptoms already staying home. Parents teachers ALWAYS irritated see symptomatic kids (or adults) school play places. fact, call attendance line public schools require report flu symptoms. wouldn’t surprised see children flu symptoms wearing masks future. would responsible thing do. lot people trust anyone anything   Yup. argument here.   Helps smell well. people want know actual death toll. Outside morbid curiosity knowing accurate numbers help scientists prepare next pandemic. Well, least give small businesses chance survive. focus vaccinations, lockdowns. 

What worries though chance new “Moscow” mutation arising petri dish needles dentists jam gum numb jaw/teeth like 100x painful vaccine needles. anyone insight covid case rates stopped outright dropping past days US?

Looking NYT case tracker sends daily email updates, figured one day increase due lack testing Memorial Day nothing noteworthy, since there’s two days 7 day daily average increased. rising casss? add this: one fought vaccine. teacher got pretty early (second dose mid-March) people chomping bit. family got age groups able trouble finding booking appointments. flatlining. incredibly frustrated wish initial rush lasted longer. California hasn’t gotten zero cases. variant shows evades vaccines vaccination numbers aren’t enough protect us another surge number cases still would enough get control again. problem! see. agree perspective also important know contagious patients were, whether vaccines effective prevent transmission. Although concern patients themselves, whether severe symptoms matter vaccine they've taken. personal belief virus long time care transmission metrics vaccine brands, care whether vaccines able minimise severity virus. vaccinated, pandemic you. Likewise 12. Unvaccinated adults people need worried. Everyone else get back living exactly 2 years ago. Thank you! Yeah lets hype guys got us many wars first place right?

Stop bashing todays people. Skipping: move along lightly, stepping one foot hop bounce. No, nuclear stress test overnight hospital stay show abnormalities blood test markers inflammation abnormal (I think bit month getting sick). literally skipped way get one.

What mean? one point given option working home refused option (and still is) unappealing me. husband also given option work home opted person work well. I’ve show enter Barclays Center Nets play games three times I’ve attended far. Another article read indicate vaccine received mRNA. low chances. Like 94%+ lower. I’m worried people state tracking in.

Before, Delta Gama. Now, Delta Gama.

Both variants hit counties better vaccination rates also decreasing case numbers turned trends opposite direction.

You looking numbers thinking trend go one direction. understand Delta Gama different original even Alpha. Supposing that's USA Today among respected medical journals. Give bread circuses.

Sorry one wants shitty pay combined harassed abd sbused public, benefits work pandemic.

These restaurants retail stores choice. Treat employees better,pay thrm living wages, etc. nobody. Also add onto unvaccinated people CANT get vaccine, likely significantly less effective, higher chance exposure case numbers increase. selfishness whole quite bummer unwillingly unvaccinated/vulnerable population. Especially get mutations negative features like delta variant. Sadly, much country like SF, hence comment herd immunity unlikely. Assuming states like Alabama don’t magically turn around abysmal vaccination numbers, plan moving forward? Wear masks indefinitely, despite medical community advising vaccinated people go lives?

Nothing wrong people like taking extra precautions. think balance, ok people wearing masks cities achieve herd immunity. disagree? 1\. could need multiple vaccine doses different reasons (probably exhaustive list; expertise reading many internet posts COVID-19 vaccines):

 * immune system needs see infection enough times decide really threat worth remembering. intuition behind basically every vaccine involves multiple doses. I'm sure vaccines, mRNA COIVD-19 vaccines, two doses identical, delivered spaced make sure immune system treats permanent temporary threat actually continues immune response long-term.
 * Related, immune system forgotten infection. Sometimes vaccines need repeated decades later. example, there's measles outbreak, people likely get exposed sometimes given antibody tests make sure still measles antibodies, given another dose vaccine not. understanding rare (at least measles), easily confused poor records meaning person actually never got vaccine first place. I'm sure infections immune systems forgets easily others.
 * virus changes enough subsequent doses vaccinating different, although similar, virus. there's annual flu vaccine. far [COVID mutated enough simply know whether (although fact yet good sign).

3\. vaccine manufacturers [actively new vaccines focused variants, they'll ready administer boosters necessary.

Additionally, there's ongoing work [a 'Universal' Coronavirus works, could protect known future coronviruses. Similarly, there's ongoing work developing [universal flu See that's issue delaying two weeks. gf gets two weeks 8 month old take care of.  Hmmm, I'm still going wait see safe. /s Philadelphia also twice amount people San Francisco does. number vaccinated people likely hire entire population SF sorry happening. people Brazil deserve better. people scared vaccine side effects literally every drug medication vaccine world side effects well? question make sense? Lol 

I’m tired hearing mom say “if Google data, one really wants get vaccine. isn’t enough science behind it. rushed one knows long term effects are.” 

Literally anything prescription meds, antidepressants, vaccines, etc side effects. watch commercial TV one things listed it’ll like two solid minutes listing every possible side effect one really bats eye says anything it, yet new vaccine rolls everyone talks possible side effects can’t trusted. dunno. Sorry think rant anything careful stupid reasons serious call stupid.

For example folks memory Tuskegee still fresh minds. 

We need understand folks nervous vaccine outright antivaxx. Came say that. city population 850,000~ metro area around population 4.7 million. that's taking account Oakland-Hayward metro.

San Francisco first major American city achieve milestone, City’s vaccination rates among highest nation world. addition, 90% **all** residents 65 older received least one dose.

You know “all” means, right? I’m SF basically still plan wear mask majority time. feel relaxed seeing others without one since I’m vaccinated, we’re woods thing I’m trusting judgment. doesn’t hurt anything wear one also want show solidarity can’t get vaccinated.

So many places this, comical Yep. underlining points, nothing OP link mentions masks California’s [fully reopening June 15. 

The “mask worrying” isn’t much issue California folks actually stepping get vaccinated. That’s happens. :) 

Meanwhile, businesses right require masks premises please. (It’s First Amendment right.) That’s sort separate issue; either shop don’t. That’s *consumer’s* choice. Dumb people proud accomplishing dumb things. It'll fine.

AZ delivering anyway. fairly common see Asian residents masking covid, especially among international students.  Well doesn’t fit curve? mean ton people everyday ton people everyday, exactly something would make stop stare either.

Like Miller Lite diet soda something. Good arguments, liked it. penalize healthcare? point universal. penalties stop? California gives vaccinations regardless immigration status. They're specifically targeting undocumented laborers, especially sectors like restaurant/food service, construction &amp; farming. TBH industries probably lower vaccination % college-educated WFH professionals, ""technically"" they're residents city SF since vast majority live far housing cheaper &amp; commute in. agree you, won’t problem getting another kind vaccine confirmation relevant authorities. concern particular situation. don’t *know* sure yet need annual boosters. Pharma companies preparing possibility, it’s means given. 

How often need booster depends factors. things, immune system eventually “forget.” Usually, bacterial pathogens. That’s need tetanus booster. kid immunity body makes clostridium tetani bacteria temporary. 

Something like measles, two shot MMR good life kind immunity body makes measles virus life, measles almost never changes, even does, can’t change much it’ll stop able infect. 

On end, you’ve got flu, mutates super fast, whole lot infectious mutation pathways. need flu shot every year flu different enough every year lasts year’s shot isn’t going good. 

Corona viruses between. mutate measles, nearly much flu. immunity long lived, people survived SARS 17 years ago still immune, there’s reason think SARS 2 would much different. reason potentially spin booster case mutates enough another dose slight modifications might protect newer variants. far, current vaccines work identified variants, we’re ready case ever don’t. 

Newer vaccines going go little slowly virus isn’t circulating much, it’s going take longer reach numbers determine effective is. they’re still working some. whole planet protect, need many get. 

What governments might head. *hope* they’ve learned lessons. know old thread, not. Please take something available now. lot people died could vaccinated, mRNA anything else. breaks heart one country essentially anyone get vaccinated line since January people purposefully wait around get horribly sick.

SF achieved herd immunity, fyi, it’s possible areas.

Until then, we’ll unchecked spread pockets unvaccinated people fuel smaller hot-spots “variants concern.”

Admittedly 3 weeks since I've Marina, streets pretty dead there.  know right? Living bay excuse. demand vaccinate Gritty immediately. I'm curious. show correlation better education ? Flying Spain next week see Covid certificate works :) Ironically viruses would likely never expand extent COVID did. 10%+ IFR (in early COVID days would represented 25%+ CFR) would enough scare even ardent hoaxers behaving. 

COVID deadly (and hospitalizes enough people) big problem, deadly terrify enough population things necessary contain it. wife travelled air work states 2019 &amp; 2020. got super sick weeks virus took NYC (our home time) swore worst illness life.

Now imagine exposure fact exposed opposite. happens places like AL. number people sub simultaneously absolutely convinced COVID October 2019 3 lab workers Wuhan getting sick smoking gun evidence COVID leaked lab November 2019. almost nowhere requiring masks entry 

Personally, think it’s huge pain try keep track everywhere masks aren’t required, it’s easier wear one whenever go shopping. Wearing doesn’t bother much, get everyone different regard. Brazil like US ways.

It's big country huge, rapidly-rising waves go quickly go up. least national scale. Instead, big waves specific areas, numbers across nation remain fairly stable. That's generally things happened bigger countries.\*

Brazil *differs* US insofar can't produce many vaccines, can't afford kind shutdowns.

Partnering organization mean PEOPLE counted % one really gave good answer first question, IMO, immunologist Jon Yewdell talks here: suggests lifelong immunity possible certain virus (likes measles Mumps) virus disseminate lymphs blood order pathogenesis onward transmission occur. Presumably initial infection vaccination, lymph nodes blood filled immune cells fight infection areas infection gets control.

In contrast, viruses like influenza common cold viruses simply replicate mucosal surfaces (nose, throat, lungs) order pathogenesis onward transmission occur. turns bodies less capable controlling (or perhaps permissive of) infections mucosal surfaces. mucosal antibodies, whatever reason they’re less effective totally blocking infections. that’s why, even though we’ve probably exposed common cold coronaviruses dozens times throughout lives, still get reinfected every couple years. 

(Side note: Even though measles, example, respiratory route infection, think one implication technically could measles infection lungs, body stops there, never causes disease leads onward transmission).  Still answer question.....

They'd anyway. might well get good they're gonna bad shit anyway. already covid early last year, really didn’t need quarantine social distant last year right? Given reinfection rate low Yep. next thing know we'll cards saying whether passed driving test not. watch put needle in. feel like psychopath can't deal suspense look away. drastic measures seen country increase pace vaccinations, Sindh government last week issued directions stop salaries government employees refuse get vaccinated July.

I see main headline, hard circumvent blocked sim card, losing salary greater impact. Hey, gets one person vaccinated and/or saves one life, good him. supposed discriminatory. discriminate people vaccinated not. Except whole short weak lungs stuff. No, mother's family indicative risk father's. myth die. MPB genes X chromosome, also Y, MPB genes autosomal. complicating factors.

Kids getting tested less, likely asymptomatic more.

That said, would outlier, studies shown much reduced ability spread children. feel devoid evidence-based reasoning? guarantee like use terms like ""big pharma"", ""leftist"", ""experimental mRNA"" ""untested vaccine"".

Also, correlation implies causation right? Indian. confirm Appreciate it. usually use get past paywalls, reason work morning. Nah. would still vaccines instead America hoarding raw ingredients, rest world would able put use. wtf B1372 variant done right thing understanding side effect related immune system kicking overdrive people strong immune system. probably caused heart issues. Okay, made mistake Seychelles used Sinopharm Sinovac. remembered incorrectly.

Second, death rates Peru Brazil anything it?

The point relatively high vaccination rate vaccines ~60% effective may still prone outbreaks dramatically different results highly vaccinated population 95% effective vaccine. vaccine used makes big difference.

Point mistake, that’s fair. it’s eff’n internet comment, major news article peer reviewed study. It’s pernicious ‘misinformation’ lol. E.g.? afraid needles kind pathetic adult

You're child, get mildly unpleasant medical procedure Look I’m trying troll you. I’ll admit initial comment lacked tact conceived malice. Cause sub induce fear despair. angers me.

I don’t think theres single reasonable person doesn’t already know reality covid it’s seriousness. inundated it. think think I’m sort trump supporting, partying, frivolous complete covid denialist. I’m not. Yes I’m bitter. Losing sanity. Questioning everything. Myself. don’t question themselves. know I’m hypocrit. suffer dunning Kruger effect. Cognitive dissonance. it. want think everyday every moment whatever I’m could potentially kill someone? try think that… plight others… not?

I’m dumb dumb, scraping here. lucky deemed essential service COVID line work private avaition. Medical flight contracts. wife lost half business covid lockdowns… know “woe me” it’s relative right. 

I think said billions invested diabetes prevention great… yet reading books like homo deus yuval harari lifespan David Sinclair… realize it’s also public knowledge billions billions invested medical fields projects actively trying prolong life limit… something likely benefit ultra rich… think Obama tried revamp school food program fail well. 

So I’m painted conspiracy theorist, medical field already know you’re smarter me. I’m scraping discussing covid shouldn’t thing induces polarization divide. can’t listen layman’s perspective it’s beneath something? people think want heard instead dismissed… everything I’ve read history, everything try think multi billionaires government elites, books climate change, state world, mass automation, energy sectors, agriculture, problems climate change *already* us… end day we’re told believe they’re magnanimous altruists… it’s hard pill swallow know… fails comparison know. soon use word “they” can’t attribute anything tangible… you’re credibility, critical thought, beliefs, understandings compromised. get that. 

I’m trying fight you… want truth. You’re telling it’s simple right… truly lost guess.

I can’t talk like people work… friends neighbours… shouldn’t we? discussions right? sharing other’s experiences. I’m enemy. Likely moreso, adults try cough face, food, many young children seem bother care.  hope also get mandatory COVID vaccine part sentence.  I’ve multiple stores today haven’t seen single place requiring masks China's data? data efficacy effectiveness Chinese vaccines coming everywhere China. [UAE comment replying refers study Indonesia. Unfortunately, good health policy bad civil policy—this could open door requiring papers borders. read little comment. worth anything. said virus transmissible humans, genius. would send 40 truckloads experts said big deal? 

Simpleton thinks easy second guess happening moment value hindsight….

No one f’n knew going pandemic January 2020. Please keep coloring adults talking. Lives slums less likely counted carefully. country billion people caste class big deal. Except mild often goes away without treatment. title literally clickbait. Calling heart issues meant spook people thinking fucked getting vaccine. aim spook people nothing, shut it.  This. everyone gets get vaccine move on, share spaces people. Suppose possible trigger different signals, two attacks ready instead one  makes think reported destroyed, shipped country labeled ""heavy equipment industrial lubricants"", relabeled rando pharmaceutical never heard sold 3rd world countries? mean, modern age greed corruption live in. Morals damned. *slow clap...* Yep lol. FYI legitimate PTSD 15 years therapy medical procedures I’ve through. get body piercing, walk Harris Teeter get covid shot. second dose yesterday. wanted get done earlier loss cope with. feel better I'm happy done. weeks maybe I'll start around people again. I'm still wearing mask though... actually I'm probably going stick mask on. People comment scars face didnt get sick last year. Haha. New York owns gun legally anymore? Haha that's bingo!

Based rest previous comment 99% sure already knew that, may slipped mind... unemployment rate  Many businesses card kids want buy smokes beer, either. mean businesses end getting liquor licenses revoked clerks get fined arrested time time, either.  


So sure, people rolls dice takes chances fine, sure...but percentage going crap time time.  course wrong, missed point 100%.

OP appeared making distinction DNA mRNA-type ""blueprints"", whereas pointing DNA vaccine first translated mRNA anyway (i.e. exact thing Pfizer/Moderna vaccine.)

Basically reminding OP extra step, different biochemical pathway. It’s largest city reopen far first major city It’s surreal people actually believe whole “you can’t compare efficacies” thing. Trial efficacies meant measure real world efficacies. Yes, it’s never going 100% perfectly accurate due differing conditions, margin error can’t even say 95% 65%, fuck numbers even good first place?

That narrative 100% politically motivated get people take whatever vaccine get. It’s like CDC saying “you don’t need masks” prevent mask shortage. take true statements - masks less effective people think, efficacy numbers measured different conditions - massively overstate conclusions “you don’t need masks” “you can’t compare efficacies”, people eat up. Absolutely hilarious keep proclaiming trash 

As top comment states, risk cardiac complications actually contracting coronavirus far greater 1. virus still spreading people still dying day. numbers much better months ago, areas country, infections per 100K people still worrying. best bet stop spread outright vaccinate many people possible eliminate vectors infection. 
2. Even best vaccines 100% effective, best bet truly ending pandemic vaccinate many people possible eliminate vectors infection. 
3. people medically can't vaccinated, remain risk, incumbent upon rest society get vaccinated prevent potential harm group people. 
4. Every infection potentially lead millions viral replications. viral replication chance producing mutation. mutations generally harmful, takes one mutation create new variant capable circumventing existing vaccinations society back square one regards economic lockdowns hospital infrastructure overruns. 
5. People choose get vaccinated problem specific thread. People choose get vaccinated lie status problem discussed. Letting people ""choose whatever want do"" result direct harm people take word are, fact, vaccinated absolutely not.  
You continuing defend people's ""right"" lie vaccination status. Yes. South African variant (now called variant beta think) reduces abilities first covid vaccine doses significantly. So, shows different strains skew data. chance dying car accident today developing DVT J&amp;J vaccine. Yikes. lot pissed people sure. getting vaccinated enough?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah nice timing xD got J&amp;J Sunday. Well, right now, USA part help world population making/shipping needed.

And obscene profit. boss, age comorbidity group likely outright die virus, initially hesitant vaccine classified experimental. seeing young adult relative deal long term lung problems getting covid decided long term health effects virus scarier possibly side effects vaccine. people company figured would least likely get vaccine previously complained covid restrictions overreaction. ended getting vaccine fear long term health effects biggest driving factor.  would want unvaccinated healthcare worker treating me. can't something simple like taking vaccine, saftey protocalls following? Im scared worried many negative things vaccinated people sources something else mRNA giving heart problems.. :( make mistake getting vaccinated yesterday :( Saying DNA codes protein wrong. That's normal language science community. look wasted doses. viable. would look wasted procurement. could awarded contracts better producer. Ohhh nooooooo!! Exactly. see way many kids around kids' ages (all 12) wearing masks stores. pandemic taught anything, it’s nothing made idiot proof Moderna tendency flip reactions almost everything... 2nd dose April, C19 March 2020.. I'm even magnetic /s

Seriously though, partner got pretty sick week second shot worst reaction I've heard of... feverish week, bed 3 days shot. That's it. Full disclosure: I’ve shot.

That said, may find interesting seems like answer - US least - it’s bit flux, sentiment swaying one way time. well. fucking horrible, can't stand it! got update HOA pool fitness center, open couple weeks masks required (pool entering area get go inside restroom, sitting pool).

Masks required indoor gym unvaccinated people.

But outdoor pool everyone still wear one entering going restroom.

This makes sense. 

Is huge deal? No. frustrating. old Mr Cat follows moment becomes aware presence moment longer physically accessible. meows adamantly pick give 100% attention love! I'm adjusting new dynamic old relationship best can! hiked 4.5 miles immediately dose 2. Good thing I'm woman!  5G due lack vaccination, 4G due actions telecoms, put significant pressure people. God never thought that! /s

Being outside interacting people love trust.

Go back hovel. Updated version research study new excess mortality 8 states, including Madhya Pradesh, indicates Covid-19 mortality India could 2.1 2.6 million people.  According [this April 28, 4,000,000 fully vaccinated individuals Illinois, 32 died Covid. article says that's 1/100th percent, math wrong; 40 4,000,000 actually 1/1000th percent.

1/1000th percent US population would 3,300 deaths.

April 28 two months average since people got vaccinated. time period US are, average:

  5,800 flu deaths
  6,300 car accident deaths
  5,000 brain anyerism deaths

This extremely simplified view yes, glance, appears data death vaccinated Covid less likely three causes listed above. likely drop much people get vaccinated chance even exposed Covid falls. Thanks linking page says vaccines work, don’t know linked since nothing said went effectiveness vaccines  child refuses take medicine? kid cried shots older age should've, still can't look needles entering skin purpose, bet ass I'm vaccinated.

I kid year get chicken pox, I've willingly toughed vaccines ever since. Human transmissibility part problem virus seem mind species.   No, simply care much. danger passed US, we're using vaccines 95% efficacy Chile using vaccines 51% efficacy. case numbers continue plummet despite restrictions socializing going away. 

It's funny two months ago, sub excited US reopening anticipation cases declining, now, cases actually declining quickly anyone could hoped, everyone wants lockdowns again.

All say I'm glad politicians stopped listening you. No, saying clickbait headline tone story irresponsible cause even reluctance among unvaccinated Life back normal ASAP great numbers. get United, Swiss Air British Airways variants? That's proof though :/ Delusional  vaccinated American go packed airport, sit packed plane go Germany drive across border Canada camp wilderness. Awesome. get another ..lol.. general principle less info fed better. dont mind much it’s app truly anonymous reporting data, think rest need w data stripped identifying information - can’t make show papers. 

I understand people dont want government specific info them. honestly glad see least people dont blindly follow they’re told. think we’ve two extremes here, one way “oh yes whatever say, must good idea,” people forget there’s middle ground. example, beginning said going shutdown time period, also went dragged felt like dull tool killing whole categories businesses instead letting try find way operate safely, jack shit real sources transmission - peoples private get togethers holidays. dont like hurting one group needlessly real bulk issue another group. portrayed either “you’re happy stay locked house forever” “you want kill grandma.” Ah. work technology, suppose I’m spoiled! ^_^ LOL cats fucjing obsessed article address AZ, mRNA vaccines, common uncommon side-effect AZ according news. Good thing got checked out, great better. disagree ""better every way."" parts job fine Zoom call business simply better handled person, especially field. evidence long covid children? think held liable exposure little Jimmy covid evil Nancy get vaccinated seduced campus gave Covid-19. Yes, restaurant nyc show sit vaccinated section. say stick comparison. certainly remember/connect it. Water/Gatorade. Please tell restrictions aren’t place anymore kind number. remember first case Raleigh. wouldn’t even say - “a restaurant North Hills” - might lead person identifiable. think even contact tracing thy dont tell tested positive without consent release info. “someone” said contact w you. be! That's bad second dose side effects got. stay home sick, it’s covid thing. could still get people sick whatever have. Isnt j&amp;j family company? Pretty sad tbh

A centralized data base would help much keep track progress help managing severe policy could show minor medical procedure last week. first time show US, vast majority vaccines delivered Pfizer/Moderna, know works Delta variant (see huge comment links).

Virus gonna virus, variants really matter. Vaccines gonna vaccinate, make sure people get one. might catch hate fair cards super easy replicate. didn’t give sort numbers barcodes actually set cards apart anything index card. It’s great prove I’m vaccinated, shame thinking would happen. absolute disgrace hope right people go jail this. Controversial, think situation like Russia, tourists invited take shot people don‘t want rather make vaccine mandatory certain jobs instead going back lockdown. think feds saying weren’t keeping one supposed one big things trying assure people of, didn’t feel like Big Brother quite much. What? There's 3 major cities US: LA, NYC, CHI move goalposts every time. give governments totalitarian power give up. new pro lockdownies can't seem understand it. This...I know sometimes ""shadow NYC"" complex, think count major city... know two dose vaccination huge effect chance getting it. Therefor almost impossible see sort spread among 50+ 20-25. states ban government agencies using one though. since heavily disincentivizing (I mean, feds didn’t lower drinking age, used withholding highway funding force states it, ended pretty damn successful) end result purposes - state said can’t require proof vaccination, it’s likely something way easily demonstrate beyond “look picture piece paper took phone, swear it’s faked.” haven’t, friend bartender Brooklyn show stop wearing mask working. would wait feel better. Call ahead ask think. He's talking breakthrough cases serious symptoms. extremely rare. 

Yes, zero, neither million things make sick world let's let vaccinated people live lives. Fully vaccinated AZ mRNA? provide cards prove vaccination employer. provide state registry shows dates lot numbers. information cards also, anyone fill top part reason provide state documents give employer right look documents. would prefer work office instead home, much better every way? Uhh since 17th may major change happened. That’s less 3 weeks. correct. Co-morbidity includes high blood pressure, lung disease history smoking, history heart disease, obesity (i.e. many US). opposed ones vaccinated, still carry virus put biohazard...

But vulnerable already vaccinated, restrictions anyway than? mUh PrIvAcY  trouble accessing content, archive could literally vaccinate entire country doses 😭 believe probably correct, I'll give benefit doubt. common belief among patients. first place, genetic tests determine type virus. Almost everyone dying within last 10 months would one tests. autopsy, many people thought die something else found C19 hearts, lungs, brains, etc. 500K people died last year would expected according CDC data, yes, I'm sure see people. So, would please ask 2 3 people think lie allow access medical records. I've asked every person told give name one person (over 20 people) far, one. So, please ask them. honor privacy tell anyone contributed medical findings are, share findings them. (Anyone else contact though Reddit. I'm interested assertions without facts.) Yeah experience here, pretty painless.

And yes agreed, IVs blood work way worse pain. hard find veins every time take multiple attempts it. afraid needles would trying really really really hard absolutely reason hospital.

Ironically one time got vaccine hurt needle tape MD used little bandage getting stuck arm hair. Peeling serious pain, like 2/10, least! People: ""Wow vaccine 90% effective, that's great!""

Also people: ""Wtf get sick vaccine?"" Well let’s see works them… Hosting Euro2020 games 50% capacity locking businesses. 🤔. know Euro games aren’t Russia still. real pandemic friends made along.  actually require test Slovenia... majority Russians (62%) still ready vaccinated country’s Sputnik V coronavirus vaccine, according poll independent Levada Center published Wednesday. According Levada, quarter respondents (26%) ready vaccinated, slightly lower percentage February (30%)

And Chinese vaccine probably even less ""popular"" mean... least that's personal risk. also proof wearing mask. confirmed utterly inadequate world's leadership dealing thing, deadlier virus comes along truly fucked.

Also stupidity general public.  comment downvoted? It’s actually quite important realize fully vaxxed people still contaminate people risk. viral vector vaccines seem particularly difficult produce. surprised tough make enough double dose population size, delta variant single dose cut it. Really luck draw. UK great initial vaccine program dose numbers ramped they're really slowed unfortunate side effects AZ. Can’t raid employee pension funds ? Thank you. didn’t jump conclusion asked question, guess answer don’t know yet. act allowing person remove mask around highly vulnerable people considered risk conclusive evidence safe. People irrational fears usually aware fears irrational getting still incredibly difficult. try compassionate instead calling people names. one people tells clinically depressed people ""just get it""? sound like vaccinations going well lock type events due spikes. enough Sputnik vaccine effective? Bangladesh I'm currently sick fever ranges 99 101. covid got tested yesterday I've first round Moderna second shot supposed today. hold off? contract holder towards EU, Janssen would responsible regulatory performance contractors/contractees. Indemnification JJ Emergent issue JJ (whom would normally indemnification back-to-back contract manufacturing agreement Emergente). However, responsibility towards EU J&amp;J’s. ""good news""? fear digital world, cut non-compliance. Also, seniors need see smile. Patients dementia declining rapidly part due limited communication caregivers. lot seniors hearing loss, reading lips body language important (in addition hearing aides, obvi) Masks clear windows crap bc breath fogs still messes nonverbal communication. residents vaccinated staff vaccinated, need ditch masks. say someone taken pandemic seriously. bar near reopened vaccinated people. closed since March 2020. different efficacy test several important reasons.

First, vaccinated people population, chances exposed. 99.99% population vaccinated, sick people see vaccinated.

The second difference that, unlike double blind trials, people vaccinated know protection, likely take risks.l

In conclusion, 10 16 probably great, really efficacy value compare to. apples oranges. No. studies said *tested* vaccine influences spread yet. Separate studies done answer question. confirming denying equivalent saying yes. Scientists make careful decisions. Let conduct studies use knowledge save lives. jump conclusions actual conclusions drawn. healthcare worker vaccinated. Recently, local nursing home close visitors employee tested positive Corona virus. deprived weak elderly patients right see families. Families also important recognize problems member nursing home. Hospitals patients oxygen weakened immune systems.  

As healthcare worker, believe obligation patients protect them. unique HCW. Think truck drivers required pass demanding physical test qualify drive huge truck road. anyone think truckers control blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease allowed drive huge truck endanger others? No. 

Those HCW (including secretaries others) ashamed themselves. hope consider issues either get vaccination use civil rights get job another environment endanger patients. Many countries including US Mexico peak UK decline. January 7th roughly. Yet different restrictions. alternate explanation cases started go January mostly accord.

You forgetting another known factor, Kent (now known alpha) variant. limited November ""second national lockdown"" older less transmissible variants greatly suppressed. However due R0 alpha around +0.7 older variants, greater measures needed suppress it, hence restrictions introduced 4th January. USA Mexico alpha variant significant numbers, needed fewer restrictions bring R0 1 lower. me, obvious solution seems be: develop vaccine passport framework infrastructure right now, implement everyone chance get vaccine.  Uk limited supply basically put entire country queue ironically likely higher final take rates open access earlier, since forcing people wait, appreciate turn maybe take look size Canada. saw one study say 25% less most. much might think. Get Science.  like yearly installment plan coronavirus. Ultimately needs end government needs push live virus vaccine uo dramatically get us single shot turn page Covid era. That’s mind boggling me. That’s massive amount dispose of. 1 year, minimum mandatory would fine me. I'm huge fan mandatory minimums, 600k people died. doubt many otherwise never issues law, upstanding citizens would risk year prison. Plus places even requiring vaccine passports anything, risk it? Easy choice me, much rest US coronavirus or??? nations mentioned population smaller city live in. It’s fair comparison all.. obscene profit

Capitalism

Pick one Lol Uh oh, watch out. give anti Vaxees ammo discredit vaccines!!  ARDS horrifying way die.  consciously relax much can, especially arm pierced, get shot blood draw. Helps enormously. looks like third world country hit jackpot deep discount vaccines. intubated major surgery before. 100% this. Even tho wasn’t respiratory distress one would COVID, it’s frightening. way know might more, worse side effects. seeing early stages. guess time needed see issues plateau point. went Costco today (in Aloha Oregon) checking cards anyone mask. ***Previously taken mod***

Well friend, think seeing right now. vested interest in, ain't broke, fix it...There several meat ""alternatives"", ultra processed still. Solar wind energy getting efficient cheaper. Hard see changes great leaps bounds anymore, everything incremental tech advances.

As said above, several contributing factors, control control(I feel like recite serenity prayer...lol). However, actually control lot comes consumerism capitalism (which refer PAC man model, large entities eat/absorb smaller ones. 

All keep spread knowledge.

I love chat people believe meaningful conversations happen otherwise might limited aforementioned advances tech(internet, exchange data, science news, social platforms). 

""We people"" still mean something. need understand actually power consumers.The pendulum broke, check balances work...Capitalism great, allowed monsters take control.

Thanks commenting, appreciate conversation probably one things would prosecute addition things might investigating. think need take account Singapore less 2% population test positive Covid. 

Singapore population size close Wisconsin, seen 62,000 cases, whereas Wisconsin seen 620,000 cases.

The best estimate 40% Wisconsinites caught Covid, I’d argue higher places schools open. 

Our vaccination rate natural infections gives USA better chance variants. 

I saying variants concern, definitely hope get vaccination rates 70%-80% think places US late August get virus check. 

Wisconsin right 7 day average 121 cases per day, falling fast.

April 15th 769 7 day average new cases
April 22nd 676
April 29th 649
May 5th 591
May 13th 444
May 20th 377
May 27th 263
June 3rd 145
June 10th 121


And honestly last 2 weeks Wisconsin wide open.

There always chance seasonality turns us new variant see cases rise, hopefully get even people vaccinated. *Raises locally made beer* Fuh real bruh. need monopoly one time they’re killin’ used afraid needles get blood draw every month. Still like dont quite feel like I'm going faint anymore I've one two replies deleted bot reason honestly scratched head :(.  It’s really frustrating realize much supposedly unbiased scientific information colored motivated political concerns.

Take variants example. know e.g. Beta (SA) variant significant immune escape, potentially lowering Pfizer efficacy 75%. rarely hear media - whenever quote scientists saying something, they’ll say “the vaccines still highly effective variants”, quite true (75% still pretty good enough herd immunity), don’t mention else equal, Beta variant increase risk vaccinated people fivefold, would think important information could easily factor people’s risk assessments.

I mean, understand it. want encourage people get vaccines, try best make sound appealing possible. They’re working assumption people generally stupid understand statistics, frankly inaccurate. still, principle, believe it’s still best practice give people facts, inform accurately possible, rather trying manipulate selective information want do, even it’s “for good”. could get goddamn vaccine question: exactly common myocardtis cases teens getting vaccine? im thinking vaccinating son, hes 13, hasn’t hit adulthood yet, caught wind myocardtis news going on.   Real talk.

Has anybody ever show card all?

Omfg Antivaxers people ""opinion"" tend extra loud. country outcry russian Sputnik vaccine made available choice, governement bought 100 000 doses. end total 1360 people registered vaccine... chance hell lol  Get butt scan force anyone get it, expect freedoms enjoyed rest us home, living cautiously waiting vaccine.

Coming lock-down privilege got vaccine. mask take away freedoms, kept alive able return them. Thank you! particularly frustrating family actually got J&amp;J even felt it, opportunity weeks earlier would otherwise.

However, there's little information afterwards comparing real world efficacy, questions gone unanswered: need booster shot, get mRNA booster, safe traveling unvaccinated country on. Pretty much data coming foreign countries using J&amp;J, thing I've seen CDC saying ""no unexpected patterns emerged"". can't help feel possible seeing clear data J&amp;J worse purposefully stifling avoid discouraging people getting vaccine, hope I'm wrong CDC publishing little data breakthrough cases can't help wonder something like up.

I admit, feel completely burned CDC one, went got first shot available even though felt best one, know whether safe wife travel family South Africa one able get vaccinated yet. messages safe vaccination working average (and definitely is, vaccines awesome), there's little public real world information US individual vaccines herd immunity useless travel different location it. actually higher since gives China 0%, they've applied 800M doses, imagine that's 600M first doses? would bring global count around 20%.   post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

When CDC Dr. Fauci said people wear masks socially distance, told people that. vaccine rollouts started happening people able get it, encouraged people get get line. CDC revised mask recommendations vaxxed non-vaxxed people -- I.E., wear masks still -- followed it. He's following CDC recommendations regarding 70% vaccinated threshold magic number herd immunity erasure remaining Covid-19 protocols.  


68.whatever% close 70%. 70%. nice, round number looks good billboard plastered CNN evening news. also CDC's recommended number ending sanctions left place. hopefully get there.  


If anything, Cuomo following science close. least according people. That's there's plenty people saying ""oh, close enough"". But, call. science's call. think marijuana interacts first dose got yesterday? ""governments"" magically produce goods services own, means someone else hiring. someone probably inexperienced, greasy palms. cause debacle first place, handing production incompetent state backed subcontractors ill equipped safely manufacture vaccines. 

NYT followed paper trail hefty political ""donations"" land job, fucked J&amp;J astrazenica process. hundreds millions doses lost old boy circlejerk That's going total loss. Don’t argue people think shutting world flu appropriate Crazy situation! sister law husband refused dose (some distrust vaccine hint disbelief Covid serious) family gathering Memorial Day house. Luckily ‘WE’ family members got shots unlucky Covid. Reality check!     Similar situation country, Malaysia.

Malaysia ordered 44.8 million doses Pfizer, brand. Nonetheless, doses arrive July onwards.

From AstraZeneca, Malaysia signed deal 6.4 million doses last December. date, zero doses delivered AstraZeneca themselves. Rather, 828,000 doses Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine arrived COVAX separate order AstraZeneca themselves, country.

Sinovac meanwhile, Malaysia ordered 12 million doses January. 3 million doses already delivered. rest order set delivered end July.

For many countries, choice Pfizer, AstraZeneca, etc. Chinese vaccines. choice Chinese vaccines vaccines. that's case, clear choice better. Sounds right, much better 3.7 million infections. UK still AZ Pfizer. 70% 30% ratio
 

india 90% AZ. producing 100 million month. reason US etc it.

What hurt AZ Oxford non profit clause. can't scale low cost offered EU without taking significant losses tried scale vaccine raw material short supply. Pfizer Moderna failures supply would diverted AZ J&amp;J.  clients still require unvaccinated nobody going around checking cards anything. might it. not? care dying. There's plenty auto pump gas NY though (maybe city?). second dose Monday evening, teach online course Tuesday morning. first shot felt barely weather sore shoulder.

Odds symptoms equal severe first shot? guess get employees cheap cake well, long come hard working executives bonuses is, otherwise maybe thank card

Actually card, thank you..

You know what, forget it, get back work I’m glad feel better. Hope you’re okay agree. got teen second vaccination showing questions I'm happy know look for.

I worried would scare off, credit said worried rare happened covid. Kid done research talked it. awesome! one states even banned vaccine passports EU ? Major Israel one vaccine youth. think great compromise study antibody levels young people this.

It really could enough 18 25 30. know enough people unnecessarily go side effects. Personally wouldn’t get first dose pub would around about-to-be-vaxed people drinking free beer. Second dose, maybe. 

But yeah, takes get people get vaccinated, it. beats alternative don’t get vaccinated. Lol. problem sons. take easy week second dose. COVID associated far greater risk vaccine age groups. That's studying spread though. studies test show opposite results. know why, kids spread less puberty. lot schools wide open masks, parents getting vaccinated, cases kids also dropping like rock adults almost always give kids way around. 

Everywhere around world gets adults vaccinated sees huge drop children's cases.  Afaik, facility licensed covid vaccines yet, big deal. company, plant. plant Baltimore ever produced licensed biologic product. anthrax vaccine plant trouble distant past quite well regarded FDA. That's death injury rate restrictions. car restrictions, would way worse. sentiment basically prolife nutshell. aborted babies anything vaccine? Someone said did, nope, can't risk it, end discussion. Um Miami lately? don’t even think ever truly closed lot studies tested kids schools weekly. Iceland one 40,000 kids. 

I'm suspicious study that's outlier. sell bs woo woo treatment. God forbid person pcp proceeds suggest holistic counter meds needed prescription meds.  legitimately didn’t even feel it. I’m iffy needles Injected another nurse talking 15 minute wait period. Didn’t even notice till put bandaid on. I'm hoping pfizer works lol I'm done shit said low chance happens. Probably near 0%, even. 

That's point though. point ""we know long term effects vaccine"" sound argument also used COVID itself. want learn HIPAA cover. way hell someone providing health care services call entity gave covid shot, ask got one them, disclosed them, without HIPAA violation unless explicitly give consent writing.  


""HIPAA permits protected health information used healthcare operations, treatment purposes, connection payment healthcare services. Information may disclosed third parties purposes, provided appropriate relationship exists disclosing covered entity recipient covered entity business associate. covered entity share PHI another covered entity recipient previously currently treatment relationship patient PHI relates relationship. "" 


The ticket taker Madison Square Garden, shocking may be, one parties obtain information without permission. punishment need man vaccine site week. America's first major city Chicago metropolitan area fully reopen.

FIFY  Vaccine info \*per se\* fall HIPAA, provider revealing patient's medical information without permission absolutely would. ""except Covid"" asterisk.  


I say couldn’t done anyone gave enough shit. responding comment NY database vaccine info. database would inherently incomplete, especially place like NY many people coming going. Bumfuck Idaho, probably no; probably got shots local Walgreens.  


Nobody Yankee Stadium going get sign release allowing Wake Med Raleigh release vaccination information, go take time request follow separate hospital system, waiting line 10,000 people behind trying get baseball game. going happen. super glad uncle Trudeau made right choice invested money Pfizer Moderna first. fact getting many doses without capability production &amp; coming OVERSEA still makes wonder lucky this. also helps fact politician openly supporting vaccine except couple got kicked conservative party view. discriminates poor cars learn on. Vaccine info fall HIPAA. ways check someone faking it, time resources. places given vaccines keep list got batch vaccine even there's central database. Lots states databases well. someone's vaccination came question could traced back place specific batch number vaccine. lot hoops jump (and been) done. someone overseas. would prove vaccine passport system come from? Recently famous Taiwan reporter get sick died less 24 hours. tells many infected patients escaped testing. Taiwan far getting woods. took vaccine. glad took vaccine. also glad know this. family couple cases Myocarditis pre-covid, overall heart issues general. would rather aware especially since family seems susceptible non-diet/exercise based heart issues whatever reason. So, know. 101 million people fully vacced Jan - April 2021, 10,000 breakthrough cases recorded. CDC certainly time low community spread even tight restrictions many states. That’s chance .009%. may trust CDC. vacced people could easily spread it, we’d surely know now. data continues show don’t, vaccines work anyway- might infection, little actual disease, much, much lower viral spread. 

It’s risk assessment. risk vacced people getting spreading incredibly low. point, people insist vaccines don’t really work aren’t following science. Springs around 5% better far vaccine rates. High 40s vs low 40s. Still quite bit state average.

Vaccine effective whole obviously risk goes cases have. also encouraged mutation, could also less effective  Thanks.

Unless published journal article, probably don’t know long process takes, especially journal like JAMA. that’s best time Doctors didn’t take care covid patients time design studies, collect data, write papers. Indian gets bad rap sometimes, get things running. systems often pretty scrappy, end, work. often left shaking head make happen roll duct tape applied right place. 

Full disclosure, I'm American working Indian firm. Sadly advisement going help generally conservative laborers work get vaccine. half small company got vaccine, three people typically heavy equipment operators me, woman. None 4 guys interested, even one got covid last month (two confirmed cases among us total) :( One question: based lessons learned COVID-19 disaster, case similar future pandemics, governments going sacrifice safety citizens sake economy going see pattern response future (denial first, downplaying, secrecy, confusing citizens, etc.)? That's mask mandates vaccinated individuals next Tuesday Yeah, Trump almost second term probably would've pandemic happen. Takes virus kill virus. There's also something said getting house interacting co-workers in-person. I'm introvert working completely alone rough! lab work wfh short-lived option last year anyway. office folks vaccinated much nicer six months ago double masking worrying getting sick time, though. Well couldn’t find info. 🤷‍♂️ 

I’d consider faulty.

Edit: I’ll request info again. Maybe fixed it. Early release getting jab. ...? IDs already? questions:

* single dose vaccination, body fight certain viruses decades lifetime viruses need yearly vaccination? possible scientists invent COVID-19 vaccine require annual repeats consensus possible?

* Irrespective origins COVID-19, worldwide ban gain function research becomes 100% safe? Nuclear energy deemed safe clean way produce energy never account variables turn inventions deadly disasters, hence Chernobyl Fukushima disasters. mistaken, lab leak deadly virus similar 2002 (?) SARS virus COVID-19 catastrophic happened Fukushima.

* research produce potentially effective COVID-19 vaccine underway stopped current developed vaccines? part mentality. lot people trust vaccines. matching entry state database legit one. Who... People trust authority? agree. think blatant history putting profit health people would skeptical least. It’s not. thread trying convince people wear masks thought comment that. comment actually makes sense all.

(It’s actually next thread down. mistake.) certain parts Asia, cleaning standards good thing. love local food try careful unless eat extortionately expensive restaurants, eventually get me. Pretty prescient Biden over-order many vaccines. supply chain issues like this. always give away excess vaccines rest world buys good protects Americans. vaccine works Delta, anyone got one complacent. Correct. SinoVac remotely effective, NEED doses wait 14 days second dose. get 65,3% protection showing signs getting it, 87% effective keeping people away hospitals, 90,3% effective keeping away intensive care 86% preventing death.

Too much attention paid speed vaccination, Chilean government put enough emphasis fact needed doses. people relaxed bit dose Covid-19 continued spread. Yes, myocarditis simply inflammation tissues surrounding heart, i'd imagine everyone gets upper-respiratory virus gets myocarditis varying degrees.

Do need worry it? No. become dangerous, inflammation needs severe, means immune response would need severe. vaccine cause anything close level inflammation. running fever go safe. not, worry.  like America months ago. wait get 60% enthusiastic people already gotten it. Hey, TRYPANOPHOBICS read this:

Imagine many needles gonna need end hospital Covid. showed mine get free donut sums perfectly Delta variant? even sequencing? Shows planet borrowed time.  people get together relatively minor virus, climate change crush us. ……
No. sibling child feared needles I. deep tissue injections. Grow fuck up. MAKES SEnSE NOw. second Moderna shot, fever showed 25 hours later disappeared around hour 36. minor symptoms point though aren’t having. could still see something next day, suspect you’ll fine. Well since necessity naybe theyll think twice refusing vaccine. People refuse vaccination deserve cut society. Ban leisure gatherings, lock homes, allow get groceries like one. something shame instead. danger.  Opposing viewpoint here. autoimmune disorder, MCAS, that's flaring worse last couple years. Pretty much anything pharmaceutical sets off, takes months stuffing histamine blockers perfect diet get back sort baseline. don't, starts destroying tissue throughout body, including connective tissue holding joints together (I ehlers danlos hypermobility well).

I knew tolerate process traditional vaccines all, also knew asshole antivaxxers going get us herd immunity enough function survive human being, decided try MRNA. really wanted Pfizer, lesser dose, could get eligibility slot Moderna. sit, two months second shot, swollen tongue lips, hair coming clumps, higher chronic pain, blisters hands feet, patches eczema everywhere. I'm steroids (with complications body), missed call CDC yesterday checking in.

I regret getting vaccinated all, know struggle physically next year might rack damage kills performance career. stuck gut, ignored everyone insisted nuts make difference get first available, waited Pfizer. turn people like mostly faring better one. 

So someone touchy wants wait one know tolerate, let them. know bodies live them. someone please explain takes lottery encourage people get shot? seen states cities offering college scholarships, alcohol, doughnuts, lotteries whatever else bribe taking vaccine. can't people take without incentive? live Germany see hoops people jumping trying get vaccinated shortage. names put multiple lists, calling Dr's day looking cancelled appointments, people posting Facebook heard Dr Dr extra shots. People standing lines outside offices even Dr's hopes getting shot. friends American flown home get vaccinated. yet people need incentive getting something return instead simply smart thing get whole world mess. mean fuck?  think patients already hospital got infected I'm mistaken? Hence lowered immunity that's case. Russian anti-vax propaganda aimed Americans seems backfiring. Lol idea may stay permanently is...numbing. entire Global Healthcare System need rebuilt able produce vaccines identify outbreaks. finally safe.
If human beings defeat Smallpox, defeat Covid-19. pretty much dentist. daily part life since 22 lol Getting vaccinated maximum avoid transmission. Short never seeing friends family ever again.  Wow...glad renowned scientist like incredible understanding new disease.

Can’t wait separation work home Exactly wanted know reading article. helpful informative. don’t see relevance comparing current deaths/cases low vaccinated countries current deaths/cases high vaccinated countries. It’s total apples oranges comparison doesn’t tell us anything.

Once limit discussion high vaccinated countries, quality healthcare also becomes far less relevant. vaccines what’s work ending pandemic, vaccines work whole point people never go doctor hospital. Hospital care doesn’t stop disease spread, limited impact death well.

Chile 5th vaccinated country, UK 6th, used different vaccines. Sinovac isn’t used, even approved, countries like UK USA. 

I don’t think it’s nonsense consider differing vaccine quality may driver differing outcomesamongst equally vaccinated countries. see chart even Donald Trump tweeted claimed 6% people actually died covid (maybe around July)? It’s kicked “see weakest die covid”. stated people died least 2 comorbidities, chart listed ARDS Pneumonia comorbidities (between 2 present good % cases). companies organizations may ask send proof vaccinations work. create documentation could used catch people fake cards. also think USA probably digital records vaccinations.

Here Canada, vaccination records also digital. possible send copy digital records directly employer anyone like via government website (Province Alberta it). secure control get access. Make difficult fake anything. symptoms really kicked 15-16 hours second jab Moderna point idiot travel business pleasure unvaccinated. 

I'd say got infected conference deserve it. matter. important metric severe symptoms are.   dacia sandero? There's 1 every crowd! Also, human feces used needles much less common sidewalks Miami LA SF...

I live South Florida, that's exactly true. Miami world class shithole. go unless I'm paid *and* I'm armed. showed discount time.  Pfizer Moderna vaccines 94 % effective. J&amp;J closer 70% IIRC. vaccinated less likely contact disease, less likely develop symptoms severe enough require hospitalization, less likely die. virus indeed “damn sneaky”, statistics cover this.

Also, lot people buying forged vaccination cards. make sure keep wearing yours.

My 3 year old awesome since wife keep stores, even though fully vaccinated.

Also 2 older siblings masks helps too. would find data many fully vaccinated people become infected? daily/weekly info this? TIA  Comments like honestly make much worse rest us. None us want kids wear masks really isn’t big deal all. guys make one! us fine waiting science catch up. lot early focus virus went towards elderly. people fixated lmao!! sort like fake I.D. all, kids get flu shot.

Kids get flu shot, 50% effective. still leaves vulnerable. think children wear masks protect seasonal there’s dead vs dead comes covid. Long Covid absolutely thing it’s brutal.

The evidence long covid mixed best, particularly children. Children getting severe symptoms length time covid doesn’t seem like understand covid works, 16 months don’t realize attacks multiple organ systems, leaving heavily damaged.

Again, incredibly rare children. evidence support fear I’d venture you’re anti-vax type person facts zoom right dude YouTube said so.

Nope. follow data act accordingly. got vaccine, child would vaccinated soon possible. would wear mask, neccesary young children.

You ignoring science. doubt children young enough vaccinated going Bit Coin conference. TLDR; Don’t become complacent you’ve recently vaccinated. Pay attention vaccine schedule — takes time you’re getting maximum protection. Dictators one priority remain dictators. Anything makes dictator look bad must supressed. biked like 40km days second shot. I... 68. Oops don’t think says that. Maybe missed something ? Makes sense, nursing home, major outbreaks happened last year employees dropping towel like crazy fearing lives.

Rural areas workplaces, bars, churches, big family gatherings like everywhere else.  rules recommend travelers fully vaccinated, immunity following infection past 180 days, face travel restrictions within EU. Poland opened registration everyone. I'll get second dose around week I'm 25. teenage students getting first doses. think better strategy chasing unrealistic numbers older age groups. point demand drop among older people, younger people artificially blocked getting shots. much criticize state, Illinois actually shit together pandemic. Actually, whole country really well compared others. 
Look fucking Canada, ffs. Yeah, long ago CDC said ""Oh yeah, we've determined Covid airborne"", know, year semi-intelligent person already knew behaving accordingly. Yes countries vaccinated age group combination age group plus comorbidities. Daycares lot financial reasons downplay Covid every turn. Literally surprise nobody important globally everyone gets vaccinated, squash variants. strong weakest country. I've long suspected really come around idea 'infection' really fuzzy term 'immune' also fuzzy term.

It's immune makes impossible virus start replicating snoozle. much less likely virus get well established immune system knocks out. sequencing data dominant virus variants? 

Not yet doubt gonna soon Moscow mayor announced severity illness increased lately ... yeah  US, pretty much opened everyone April. funny thing is, certain parts, dropping mask mandates opening meant people getting it...and parts, vaccinations slowed less people getting (so trying things like lotteries encourage people). Sadly, bit political issue...red states vs blue states, like many things. area good job vaccinations things pretty much close normal (since pandemic). 

&amp;#x200B;

I also agree AUS open everyone...and feel badly guys strict conditions. thought good first I'm thinking kind inhumane... What’s interesting there’s data suggest longer times doses leads stronger immunity.   something might “enticing reward” someone vaccine-hesitant relevant someone else’s personal choice wear mask vaccinated? We've basically affirmed since old study Singapore. experience coronaviruses, beta alpha. unlike forever immunity, couple years weird. Yet whole year, ""Well I'm believing literally bury alive data, I'll screw around antibodies get nowhere useful."" expect places checking things take turn worse. delta variant something worse starts tearing areas lackluster vaccination numbers, expect businesses start checking customers stay home otherwise. I've heard use small painless needles first save huge serrated ones anyone comes late... cost precautions also minuscule fully vaccinated want mitigate risk. vaccinated population areas 80%+ community spread negligible, still prudent mask around possibly unvaccinated people crowded public spaces indoors ventilation poor. Seems like faking vaccine card quite bit effort actually getting vaccinated..... Lock em up! Biden promising normality 4th July 4, grow bother trying reason them. want able shitty consequences. simple that. vaccine used? 10 years old still afraid needless need grow up.

There need defend vectored vaccines; monumentally good. Every vaccine have, even inactivated ones, would end pandemic month enough doses. current mRNA vaccines next generation vaccine technology, all. Yay! redditors pointed lethal virus less chance spread since either kills host fast symptoms starts showing really quick. 

This general trend, pretty extreme outliers (HIV). talk UK vaccine booster winter prob giving people different vaccine one already. 2 AZ another lol understand coming from. could well entirely correct fomite transmission SARS-2 'neglible', although think so, either way know. I'm surprised admit evidence contary, err side caution.

I agree choose, choose aerosol mitigation. choose. never choose. free consider possible vectors, act accordingly. 'choice' presented false choice.

Here's real question: think people hot COVID areas washing hands, washing public surfaces like tables desks soap water alcohol based cleaners, sanitizing doorknobs, wiping often-handled non-porous objects like phones pens alcohol, sharing utensils drinks, taking extra care handling deceased, etc.? idea age based approach significant impact spread covid reddit theory.

The idea virus rip unvacinated 30s makes sense. also possible vaccine rip entire age range level vaccination currently US UK US approach used.

It may turn correct theory thought fact. Melbourne, Australia finished another hard lockdown 5km radius movement allowed, travel 25km home - lockdown due outbreak 5 cases turned ~80. 

The rest australia basically back normal, nationally get maybe 5-10 cases day hotel quarantine.

our vaccination program slow people aren’t getting vaccine. Less 3% population fully vaccinated 

as 20 year old, I’m going eligible vaccine 2022 likely. 

Is rest world vaccinating age groups trying get many jabbed possible? 


I feel like aus open gates everyone wants one. 50’s eligible AGES yet still… less 3% entire population taken offer able access it. 

I want travel i’m young. dream growing would flourish uni, study abroad make friends really interesting people. far uni bedroom. sf seven miles wide seven miles long lol it’s huge place B.1.617?  Seattle overly cautious one take single drop confrontation. plenty people still super worried virus human. 

We really need party. city announce day opening aim big old block party downtown. Bring whatever surviving food truck around unmasking. require businesses mask policies advertise clearly front. Hell, maybe city government could useful provide (for free) standard postings like food safety ratings. Either way, 75% partial vaccination rate cause surge thus lock down, US safe zone yet.

It's important note full lockdown capital Santiago, incredibly dense compared rest country, lockdowns slowly lifted.  African American hesitancy vaccine strong. easily available, demand low. every fight last 150 years Darwin always wins. 7 miles 7 miles, people pretty crammed in. 

The Bay Area whole 5.75 million people.  Gee bombard citizens [lies citizens trust anything. blue collar people safe way taking vaccine unless take week vacation?

I don’t think messaging going helpful getting vaccine hesitant people finally take it… think pretty clear Canadians much better opinion SARS-Cov-2 vaccines Americans.

That take well. People generally think vaccine safe effective.

But think also realistic fear understanding danger virus. probably helps danger even existence never widely used political issue country.

Personally felt risk vaccine willing take chance. Even young person getting covid could permanent effects could disable person damage quality life. Probably agree that.

I think fact travel locked even within province cannot go regions motivation lot people get with. assume depends Delta variant hits EU that's what's pushed back UK opening completely Yeah, want everyone get vaccinated sort ""social credit"" government policy makes bit nervous. might something HOA insurance employee insurance plan stipulated, different kind insurance pool versus gym. ran HOA little while. pain ass tell folks insurance decided things. I'll never run HOA again.  People multiple countries WWII refused reduce consumption voluntarily several governments institute ration systems. Even people immediately started gray black markets certain items. Human nature pretty consistent. Thing is, that's kinda got 80%. People SF willing go bit way bit cautious greater good.

That includes getting vaccinated includes wearing mask bit often required. go hand hand.

People call us crazy, even thread, I'll laughing amazing numbers. funny thing average home prices continued increase lol. Home prices drastically up, condos slightly still selling still breaking even. better walk around, year half younger people allowed endagering others.

Now can't vaccine yet.

Now vaccinated walking around (while still infectious) spreading dangerous variants, noone danger anymore??? no.  non-working week.  dear leader would never approve lockdown! people test twice, three days apart Suck joy life steal part soul? article explicitly heavily vaccinated western world. absolutely zero chance biggest wave yet come part world article about. Children monolith; children teenagers yet likely spread much(but still do), teenagers sure spread higher rate based data have. live place people still wear masks to? why? affect you? Unlikely zero isn’t children 12 under. collective mind meld place real. Almost nowhere requiring masks entry, yet see probably 80-90% masks. It’s weird, everyone adamant “following science” science says it’s ok vaccinated folk restrictions, they’re still stuck last year.  It’s funny happens, isn’t it. yell year virus hoax, it’s cold, shouldn’t trust government, whatever BS propaganda, you’re shocked people aren’t getting vaccinated. Maybe tech startups, SoMa FiDi, even outside fire season would see people wearing masks BART around office. someone sick still wanted go work, terribly unusual see folks wearing mask.

I mean ton people everyday ton people everyday, exactly something would make stop stare either. must living two different cities. stores don’t require face masks, usually see people still wearing them. Restaurants bars. require face masks. 

I say it’s weird going store one ones without face mask. Seems like I’m something wrong hahaha California never get zero cases.  little surge might motivate vaccine hesitant get vaccinated, hardcore people remain targets infection. Passports seems better total lockdown reviving economy (without risking lives) guess. Aye, surgeons, probably arrogant bunch collectively fields medicine. Masks particulate like N95 nothing VOC’s. need something like respirator charcoal filters that. Masking properly? Requesting people keep that? None requires authoritarian state never seeing friends family again. state could not.

If mind getting sick, go party heart out. do, keep masking seeing family friends less crowded places get better gauge viral variants capable of. Paywall difference entire political faction attempting break rules political points. Pretty much immunocompromised people eligible get vaccine suggested it. wouldn’t make sense vaccine eligible people risk. big question immunocompromised producing high amount antibodies compared normal people. But, whole family vaccinated, it’s still unlikely spread them. many orders magnitude too!


A single covid virus something like 2.5 million times larger benzine gives gasoline distinctive smell. Hmm... think Chinese folks used wear even pandemic/fires. SF like 1/4th Chinese (not Asian - Chinese only).  Since poster clearly talking US, based American flag comment, I'm ""hyping guys"" got us WWII. gotten sooner.  actually probably better mRNA vaccines effective (even accounting varient explanation) mixing vaccines might result better overall immunity exposure 2 mechanisms. studied understanding. course, odd personal level deal with. Yeah many major venues aren’t open business yet (ex. Boston Symphony Orchestra still “virtual” shows).

That’s full pre-pandemic reopening. Demand is, always incredibly high, could millions day would still people hitting F5 booking page turn ASAP. someone dealt several phobias including needles, promise attitude makes worse. I’m scary situation someone laughing/rolling eyes/telling suck feel worse. someone compassionate supportive help.  read article? Traumatic experiences around age actually tied phobias adults. Experiences formative years stick life.  2 people 1 shot, everyone either healthcare worker already hospital something else. True, City Seattle did; however, King County Medical Commissioner wanted 15 minutes said everyone keep wearing masks, regardless vaccinated. we’re point businesses following instead literally every piece guidance.  think current batch global leadership worst world ever seen one time. Totally unsurprising bunch would botch global pandemic.

The situation’s bit better right thanks one “leader” particular picture, still. Incompetence arrogance abounds globally, part. Yea feel bad me, gf met April last year seeing person time moved start year, slowly resocialising cases low, got first shot people meet already fully immunized. yea even still fully socially capable point groups 4 people drain energy within seconds... school starts August clue tf supposed manage counting human beings ignoring assholes like you. first time seen it? 

Thank you! wasn’t known time, people copying Az/Coronavac strategy.  NY Excelsior Pass app. got live everyone else like you? Yes, SF place you. 🙄 seriously? Stop trolling. sound uneducated. areas correcting past numbers, places numbers may seem go down, reflected many trackers without notation actual cases happened weeks ago. mostly, it’s many areas, vaccinated percentage population still well threshold reach herd immunity, unvaxxed pockets seeing increased outbreaks. (Grand Junction, CO one example, hospitals nearing capacity Delta variant apparently spreading.)

Given vax rates across country pretty much plateaued, it’s terribly surprising case rates starting same. walking street Seattle without mask mask-wearing moron passive aggressively opened umbrella direction Newsom set 6/15 date. I’d rather have. Governor who’s extra cautious one isn’t. big problem Chinese vaccines (at least two popular ones) appears barely work single dose. two doses week, appear good much like rest them. Punishing people forced daily contact deadly contagion helplessly watch loved ones fall ill die. [Here test report 40k tests per day (the English translation great fyi reads like 40k cases per day).

The vast majority cases 50 years old and, unlike Korea, vaccine coverage susceptible poor poor outcomes likely. We’re still 500k day though, nearly 80% adult population one dose already still haven’t got 25 year olds yet. That’s point CA restrictions lift 6/15 people still wear masks care can’t get vaccinated like immunocompromised family kids B like showing faces. lol, people refusing vaccine aren’t going stay home nobody checking vaccination cards Vaccine cards government documents though. Actually, they've researching cross-vaccination lately looks like mixing vaccine still works.
I believe UK based research, I've read weeks ago can't really tell.  Please bare mind t-cell protection plays big part lessening danger future variants. escape antibodies, t-cells. everyone either vaccinated infected once, t-cells make virus less dangerous. won’t get rid virus, sure. Bit won’t pandemic state forever. That's scary Probably like black death levels tbh. People caught rugged individualism realize individual personal liberty stop begins harm kill others. know headache 5 weeks

It's clear ignored content articles almost entirely.  

I'm sure motivates argue bad faith like that, there's much point trying convince long covid real, pediatric patients suffered long term lung damage, heart damage, kidney damage, neurologic damage covid. virus smart! outsmart either fist pumping quickly sitting coming you. Mask mandates limiting essentials properly adhered later pandemic. people reckless ones got negligible difference that's worth inconvenience.

Perhaps, now, original point. limit spread, whether 20% higher. fact, friend mine doctor express concern guard delta variant despite fully vaccinated. J&amp;J improves time. funniest graph efficacy.

Also, there's reason think J&amp;J work Delta, data widely available say does.  strange It’s weird particles smell even smaller viruses.  That’s makes much tragic. I'm guessing comes colleges risk management policies. thats making cautious.

You may like responsible lives thousands people duty (legal/moral/financial) cautious.

Sucks thats life unfortunately. ""Nobody"" bit stretch. wife, in-laws, every known extended family member age 30 gotten doses sputnik vaccine here. lines people going block outside public hospital waiting get vaccinated. may apprehension first certainly feels like public perception quickly changing. That's lot shots. mistake? mortality rate young people way lower even cases rising, translating higher deaths Yeah I'm way. spent year going grocery store home depot. I'm vaccinated, I'm done. waiting we're 80% w/ 1 shot later would liked, least here. Anyone still uncomfortable going maskless free keep mask on, I'm going back regular life.   anybody refuses get vaccinated they're readily available gets sick, that's fault. 

Someone told need vaccine god side. feel Darwin might win one.  Well I'm talking Bush Miller light loll would happen stick one dose told he'd probably say ""more me"" smile, offer one later time joke.

Sorry grandpa btw nah, mess up, acted best available information time; still get additional protection it. I'd covid19 age, probably would wait second shot data (though likely downvoted removed), looks like risk minor, first shot provide protection Well based nurses know great. good news kids least don’t typically end hospitalized catch it. Mine still wear masks indoors 3 years old they’re perfect wearers r rates

Basically fast virus spreads (want R lower 1). Think thought rural households spread neighbors don’t really come contact like big city building, rural places I’ve visited small cities populations concerned grocery store, diner, hardware store, etc.. 

The piece alluded mobile Americans though rural towns see lot people come (delivery drivers, various tourists, etc..). One good thing vaccinated people less likely spread virus guess. two German family sick cancer. bought tickets hope get sickest two passes. political talking point thread assertion took 14 years identify close relative SARS circulating natural reservoir. redditors pointed lethal virus less chance spread since either kills host fast symptoms starts showing really quick.

I familiar theory. want point though legendary plagues history sweeping lethal time, seems contradict theory. ""Latino"" race disagree wrote. managed take samples air prove contains infectious virus fairly early pandemic. much harder sample air manner. 

I’m talking super spreader events. cluster do. plenty high touch surfaces well-ventilated places. common would easy detect pattern aerosol transmission. obvious aerosol experts early 2020 spread aerosols many non-superspreader examples addition super spreading examples plausible explanation aerosol transmission. 

As far super spreader events vastly understating known examples. don’t need rigorous example. find single one entirely outdoors would news me. Yet case fomite transmission anything beyond exceedingly rare.

There exactly zero examples highly likely fomite transmission - even super spreading events. examples I’ve seen researchers spitballing ideas aren’t plausible scenarios. Elevator buttons elevators generally well ventilated. quarantine trash scenario basically disproven. 

If it’s 2-3% would examples. Many examples. 

There plenty periods time across globe countries cities heavy contact tracing presence low case burden area would able trace events. 

We already animal models demonstrating aerosols require much lower load nasal doses. keeping known respiratory viruses. available evidence points conclusion surface transmission rare regular surface decontamination beneficial maximum effort already put place mitigate aerosol spread. Forcing distance, high ACH, mask use, speaking quietly all, etc. Every place allowed loud conversations singing decontaminating surfaces done opposite. Needles irrational fear. Can't stand them. Still got shot could ooo boy feel nauseous saw get needle ready Yeah that's preventing anybody people trumpeting article latest excuse get vaccinated even UK? never 'UK lockdown'.  Yea certainly concerning, look Ben Carson. excellent surgeon, great politics. would rather fired based job performance. yea, certainly beyond dumb. nutjob almost leader Conservative Party Canada. dodged bullet. Held accountable? Sure. Death penalty? product never made single human arm? crazy. Yeah. live Australia don’t covid transmissions pandemic thanks early intervention. Spending patterns quite different community cases people worried exposure risks. Pretty much none. delta variant present Michigan height spring surge, yet cases since plummeted, despite average vaccination rate. It’s dangerous unvaccinated people, clearly aren’t enough maintain outbreak. vaccines story posted didn't. Good studies shown single dose Pfizer high 92% effective 14-21 really strange study come June 2021. We've already years worth studies tracking spread school childcare locations child child, etc. amount virus nose may ""suggest"" something, matter 12 months studies show real-world data likely children become infected likely children become infected pass on. real-world studies I've read indicate young children less likely become infected infected less likely transmit it, likely due smaller lungs resulting less aerosols droplets exhaled bodies. 

Even infection numbers cited article would indicate this: early May, children accounted roughly one five new cases COVID-19 nationally, American Academy Pediatrics estimates.

By May 1st 150million Americans gotten first dose vaccine, essentially people 18. see definition children here, equally likely get transmit kids expect much percentage cases 1/5 children since (depending definition) probably comprise unvaccinated population period. fainted vaccines kid I’m ER nurse; might believe now, she’ll probably grow past years :)

I’ve also seen seizures syncopes work, happens! Unlikely. Even least vaccinated states probably enough individuals immune prior infection addition vaccinated really slow thing down, evidence points infection vaccine immunity good enough Delta won’t overload system again. forgot put question mark. vaccine work? vaccines don’t work?  80% entire eligible population double-dosed end July. Oh my, mean 100 day 130? system gonna overloadededeedddddddd. vaccines either work don’t, UK, make 95% deaths fully vaccinated. fact. arbitrary. Every metric used lockdown blown past. Positivity rate, total cases, hospitalizations. none issue.

Party science ass. Perhaps think lack critical thinking obvious dismissal evidence based practice issue? Especially considering NP student?   Sucks suck  Sure, I'm saying, less concerned employed depending seeing. long stupid opinions putting people risk job well I'm it. nothing else take solace fact mRNA based vaccines relatively easy engineer proteins. one comes along different protein, new vaccines would come way faster first generation did. Hmm, guess sound comforting. Fucking hate nyt website Im gonna pay probably cold. We’re late cold season places increasing social mobility. I’ve already caught one too. get tested, absolutely tell Covid, Flu, neither. (Neither means it’s plain cold.) Hope feel better soon! Got first jab AZ today.

I feel like shit tho lol...  Florida towns green.

Funny works. like 1 3 kids develope type 2 diabetes lifetime… seems like that’s big issue eh. Click three dots report chat. Goes right Reddit, tell experience works yeah okay /u/pingveno's friend clearly needs simple explanations, found simplified version quite convincing lot doubters around :) is. yet lot daycares still like ""kids can't catch covid easily and/or can't spread we're gonna stay antivaxxers"" Wrong! counted period. (Q)uestion mark. 
The ? operates shadows. many people worried economic impact shutdowns restrictions, never hear word insane economic impact would 20 million people dying...and people living even heightened world fear protections. 

This was/is horrible would much worse. Yeah, judging screw ups trust make even single vaccine. Funny wasn’t 100% vaccinated though.

1) kids weren’t vaccinated

2) one shot, need two weeks past final shot, know requirement fully vaccinated. Fuck ‘em.  likely *more* variants long spread high parts world. probably *more deadly.* 

Delta isn’t truly much likely kill version, it’s mostly easier catch it. let live consequences actions?

I'm hoping option, personally Renounce band \*outside stadium\* Thanks! appreciate thoughtful responses! Oh I’m sorry, read fast months data used US. figures, even technically type data
 
If Pfizer able say vaccine effective delta variant, can't J&amp;J? Either way, 75% partial vaccination rate cause surge thus lock down, US safe zone yet. Even UK currently seeing surge 78% partial vaccinations. said, potential issue could 17.2 million SinoVac vaccines Chile administered may effective single dose, especially since full dose 51% efficacy. 


As per 7,716 people confirmed infected COVID-19 Wednesday Thursday, 73 per cent fully inoculated 74 per cent 49 years old, health ministry said. think Pfizer rated 66% effective variant single dose. highest rated goes downhill there. You’re right, thinking new treatments substantially equivalent previous gold standard treatments, something like Alzheimers almost effective treatments, effectiveness wasn’t really regulated, that’s correct. I’ve edited previous comment remove sentence. fellow Italian, Giorgio Agamben know better. world going many ways unlike wars alludes to. countries take civic liberties seriously quick restitute citizens pandemic normalised (see Australia, Israel UK) restrictions surviving original purpose.  article written May 22nd, knew Delta variant incredibly transmissible could see it’s UK I'm I'm asking people..

If people included, could false %. I’m Southern California, town never enforced mask mandates, restaurants open since allowed (but one fined prosecuted)… think requiring wearing masks outside bit much nowadays vaccines available. also think keeping restaurants stuff closed terrible idea. activity won’t affect substantive manners 

Like wearing mask outdoors? masks also great fending mass public surveilance. anyone know free donuts free fries every day rest year subsidized government? question: maybe missed article include dental offices?

I dental assistant office discussion since CDC said people could stop masks. staff vaccinated know patients are? allowed ask see vaccine card prove don’t need mask?Some us want everyone continue wear masks building want vaccinated people wear masks anymore

I understand people go health clinics likely sick weakened immune system risk higher don’t go dentist feel sickness starting, dental offices still health care facility. Take consideration possibility eventually take another round winter... probably match people (as get different one). think since 1 dose provides decent amount protection, getting different ones future still effective... least that's rationally hope. corollary community level - pay attention progress rollout, relax restrictions sufficient proportion fully protected. Cell phones still call emergency services without sim card. Covid stay. Vaccines natural inmunity reduce lethality level influenza yearly flu viruses. Returning normal dependent erradicating covid. SF feel ""normal"" tech sector recalls workers Work Home settings (if ever). Friends Bay area say like ghost town, shell city compared pre-pandemic times. Florida resident, I'm telling weren't. state worse us new york, that's got hit early. Florida's governor declared war people state deliberately killed least 40k people though mismanagement ""donate pac vaccine access"" schemes. September. Can't come fast enough. Yes I’ve heard kind research I’m happy results encouraging. However European authorities pharmaceutical centres haven’t taken clear position yet, that’s prefer AZ. 
In end probably take Pfizer Moderna anyway, hoping weeks researches confirmed solid data. Chinese vaccine probably even less ""popular"" Russia.

As far know, regular vaccination Chinese vaccines Russia, trials volunteers. Russia currently uses four vaccines, Russian: [Sputnik [Sputnik Sputnik V common one. sub tracks various disinformation rounds? Society would utterly collapsed virus 35% mortality rate. people, Covid like 99.4% survival rate still entire countries essential travel banned (even fully vaccinated). key words ""too fast"", ""lethal"".

It's really gestation period. nightmare scenario highly lethal virus takes long time present symptoms, giving host plenty time spread it.

Eg, Covid way lethal still took 3-4 weeks kill able spread asymptomatically, we'd bad, bad One thing often claimed, attracts scientific scorn, virus must get milder order spread easily. little evolutionary pressure virus happen. virus already next person long kills person infected. people spreading (younger people) get ill.

- know ""mentioned"" intentional not, cracked up. Well done. exact number hard pin down, course, don’t feel sick, they’re probably getting tested, number people felt sick enough seek diagnosis tested positive point well 1%. Vaccination wildly effective. take picture card license side-by-side NYC sporting events. can't get Excelsior live NY (also live/vaxxed NJ), I've done without issue.    **probably** die there's low chance hospitalized. Facts y'all.

[503 recorded deaths fully vaccinated people US June small number compared 139,000,000 people fully vaccinated, huge number people families. zero, means ""we die"" guarantee simply can't make. 

Facts y'all. Spot on. extra month lockdown area 80% vaccination rate isn’t going save 20% unvaccinated people lockdown ends states way areas 30% vaccination rates. Getting tested 3-4 times week allowed sit bar work?  Osterholm gets lot flack here, appreciate willing share well-informed opinions willing change mind circumstances change.  what’s path forward given herd immunity unlikely point?  options readily available, vaccine definetly not. concern AZ 30% efficacy delta variant dose 1 UK rushing get people 2nd dose . Would efficacy similar people getting mRNA booster ? haven’t heard anything JNJ delta variant . spanish flu anti-maskers. able eradicate smallpox animal reservoirs. Since covid jump human animal human can't eradicated vaccination, controlled. even long shot, folks know white Christians refuse get shot frustrating me. thank opinion Smallpox unique situation virus infected capable carried humans. lack animal reservoir made ideal candidate eradication. Unlike smallpox, viruses influenza COVID carried animals can't really wiped unless prepared also eliminate potential animal hosts. depends allergy against. avoid getting vaccine contains ingredient you’re allergic to. 

If food allergies environmental allergies, there’s really difference.  J&amp;J found use booster, didn’t increase efficiency. looking using MRNA ones along J&amp;J, combining AZ + Pfizer seems work better maybe even Pfizer, J&amp;J uses technology AZ I'm going MSG foo fighters 20th insult end downvoted. true.  $$$ Please keep discussion civil topic. off-topic politics, please. Thank you. us could afford that. St Petersburg =/= Moscow Peter Hotez everybody global cost COVID going run trillions.

A million get people get job even rounding error, doesn’t even register. Nobody ever could predicted one Statistically Canada it’d mRNA. they’re 65+ definitely mRNA. Florida’s outcomes great. guess may depend live big outbreak tests? shocking people still get  Oops! Yep. hellhole, seems lot people really want buy homes here. true... NY still restrictions large venues/events. Chicago, baseball/concerts/etc back 100%. Yankees still like 33% social distancing. Shhh, let morons keep thinking sucks here. Back bus sir.  Nonsense every way look.  Damn table comment coming Osterholm, notorious predicting variant doom couple months ago wonder well JNJ work ? It’s one shot . looking 2 dose regimen . Given found Oxford vaccine delta , people got JNJ need 2nd dose fully vaccinated? COVID-19 papers fast tracked like wouldn’t believe. someone that’s voluntarily getting needles face every four months part 6 years… always sounds silly me. vaccine least painful shot ever had. 

But someone deeply understands irrational phobias, get extent. damn one weak. Given demographics people vaccine hesitancy, comment racist. year big Pharma produced multiple life saving vaccine formulations record time already vaccinated 2 billion people world, government couldn’t even figure get rapid testing program place, allocate ventilators get guidance right face masks, isn’t exactly ringing endorsement things would better pharma industry nationalized. don’t understand debate tbh.

“Nobody” hyperbole, sure, lot. Left right dichotomy works different Russia. Conservatism Russia generally associated Soviet nostalgia, certainly left. Russian government socially mostly right economically left American terms.

I even disagreeing you, clarifying mistake article.

Loser. feel like know sure sometime next year. early now. I'm also confident yearly booster; seem mutate significantly enough. I'm talking mRNA vaccines that's I'm familiar primarily available US. pay much attention vector vaccine (J&amp;J) literally know single person gotten it. used, nearly much. happen occasionally get ""Moderna rejector"" phone. can't stand seem able understand Moderna works Pfizer, results efficacy side-effects same, differences statistically negligible. None ever went doctor revealed words doctor consulted 'facebook' (sigh). Apologies came across personal attack. I’m frustrated (not you) take things far. That's virus. casserole. someone please explain takes lottery encourage people get shot?


I'm you. think lottery bit disgusting I'm sure explain it, share anecdote least. So, mom anti-vaxxer trying justify getting usual set talking points: ""Oh variants"", ""Oh, rushed"","" ""Oh, immune system strong"", etc... told lottery talking would money rather vaccine worth effort get. 

The lottery system gross, also brilliant. takes advantage anti-vaxx idea exception rather rule. like friends lost society split tribalism social media taking lives. need controll covid thats  got vaccinated Tuesday first Pfizer dose (by far prefered vaccine according research, best protection numbers recent mutations virtually serious side effects except myocarditis thing requires temporary anti-inflamatory medication).

Also, Malta 500K population, congrats, Canada top first category wither.  talking vector vaccines? I’m pretty sure read cases transmissions among vaccinated people never go away......... know vaccine shield COVID right? much alt it. we've already seen countless times, Moscow mutation may less transmissible, may less severe, unlikely escape vaccines available, limited concern.

Also, I'm obviously saying something fucking stupid like SF would refuse vaccine politics. know SF's rah-rah gung ho attitude ""do good"" strong political bent. nothing wrong per se, effective motivator building community, pretending like bay better people think rest country bit joke. 

To put another way, whole situation politically charged, think SF's performance would much average (and average would certainly better).

7/16 = 44%

FL 41% vaccinated.

So seeing disconnect. Conquering division. That's demagogue works. believe another Novavax. ""virtually all"" leaves room other.. they're necessarily conflicting. would connect private act getting vaccinated? Yikes! know classmates it? Also diagnosis? Common cold, time year (in Florida) sound right. hear sort respiratory ailment effecting young kids older adults though.

Link Always relevant: took pandemic make realise this?! look obesity rates. Obesity much dangerous individuals covid (and course major Covid comorbidity) doesn’t stop many people Aren’t incentives life “bribery case? think obesity connection might somewhat exaggerated, frankly. You’ve got 80% hospitalized patients overweight obese country that’s like 70% overweight/obese, that’s nearly statistically significant looks first glance. Probably several factors correlating too, like type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, conditions correlate body weight weight itself. 

And I’m absolutely sure nobody’s donut intake increased *that* significantly due Krispy Kreme giving away donut day. would frankly shocked anyone actually taking offer literally every day. likely they’re eating exactly number donuts ever did, choose go get one KK instead Dunkin wherever else. take didn’t watch Cubs game yesterday  Thanks, probably fine, mental health issues make bit worse social interactions, probably fine bit worried know headline propaganda vaccinated people hospitals testing positive covid right? Yeah know, traveled getting vaccinated. places require test nowadays though. hard get, extra thing get stressed about. Truth told hardcore anti-vaxxers won’t care, it’s rest persuade somehow. everyone’s safety. Wow man, real dick. Yeah, even could that, think people would ""comply"". keep posting this... 

Yes, diabetes big deal.

Is anyone arguing you? 

Also, point context thread? Perhaps, manufacturing facilities interchangeable two different technologies? Make felony too...then dumbasses can't vote. Creepy dude. anyone numbers q3 vaccine shipments EU? They're easy find q1 q2, can't find numbers q3

Theoretical shipments btw, know can't see future. Hah! I’ll believe see (in Chicago). Plenty places still closed reduced operations. Wrigley’s open there’s that. agree situation warrants investigation.  Really vaccinated? Different variant? date 28th kinda correct really. basically thats new rule, vaccinated people dont need wear masks, become enforced. however, cal osha passes rule, expected happen 17th, 10 day gap period businesses adopt rules. passed 17th, businesses start following rule 17th case . One dose Intranasal covid vaccine (of various constructs) shown produce stronger results vaccine delivered Intramuscularly, studies evluated one dose Intranasal generated  stronger responses two doses intramuscular administered vaccine-- logistical point view huge advantages intransal vaccine (no special training required, favorable storage &amp; handling, needle/recycling needed). article goes detail logistical benefits. 

Bharat biotechs chimpanzee adenovirus candidate mentioned article phase 1 trials now, expecting results month so-- preclinical studies showed 9 months _one dose_ near complete protection B1.3.51 challenge (recall IM immunization two doses similar chimpanzee adenovirus based vaccine could reliably described near complete protection B1.3.51)

The word game changer thrown around lot pandemic, fair term intranasal vaccines IMO. things could allow us dramatically pace vaccination vaccinated groups apply much stronger pressure onward transmission amendment covers freedom commit fraud?  Okay, codes mRNA codes proteins 🥴 been, decades.

Luckily diabetes doesn’t spread person person, personal choices ignoring advice eating well getting exercise comes personal consequences.

And what’s saying 1 3 kids develop diabetes life time?

It’s happening kids, pretty sketch word choice. people could wind hospital vaccinated, won’t wind hospital, don’t wind hospital, hospitals won’t overwhelmed. Pretty simple really, I’m surprised confusing you. also, reported cases mild, could people alert usual issue due recently received vaccine. myocarditis pericarditis incidence population generally suspected heavily underreported tends mild cases people usually notice enough go doctor it. We’ve recent cluster 90% vaccinated Singapore.  23 28 cases asymptomatic.  

This future managing COVID look like. sprinkle faked medical records It’s coins bro  spending billions nutrition exercise schools, even leaders wife fight 8 years states fought back could save pennies school lunches.

We ad council ads, food pyramid, snap benefits count double farmers markets WIC get people proper nutrition.

We invest hugely fighting obesity diabetes epidemic.

And I’m more, gotta address acute Situation first, don’t try change stick house brick fire preventative house actively fire. 1890s? First doses good enough get herd immunity. second “overkill”. Canada nice shape. I’m afraid needles I’m afraid catching Covid again. Also, didn’t even hurt. nurse Walgreens great job.  vaccine protects variant, there’s reason scared. We’ve known along vaccines don’t prevent infection, prevent severity. Housekeeping “by request” requesting difficult impossible, obviously discouraged. 

We access lounge would typically drinks snacks throughout day, evening happy hour more, offering coffee bottled water. 

(You could still go hang lounge, nothing eat drink). 

What would normally “fancy” sit breakfast room service included stay replaced limited “grab go” menu, option room service. 

Of course, price equal pre-pandemic. 

Honestly, sounds whiny. understand hospitality industry hit hard pandemic. also expect we’re pivot “sincere efforts stop disease” “Covid convenient excuse” lot areas. walking around mission week half ago. people unmasked myself.  IDK commenters received dirty look wearing mask. believe everything read internet (especially SF/its population).  Yep, I've heard 30 different people tell 1st case ever found state. No, probably one many viruses around time (a strain rhinovirus particularly common severe colds). also live SF, outside every day without mask on, never received weird look comment. OC either exaggerating lives unusually mask-conscious pocket city. would studies Astrazeneca + mRNA? Yes it’s obvious don’t spend enough time news. Long term effects vaccines generally happen. side effect occur, within first two months still system. enough overwhelm hospitals point. lot people claim live SF say things completely odds reality. 

My husband went office last week afraid SoMa going absolutely post-apocalyptic based scare mongering hear NextDoor/Reddit. said worse pre-pandemic terms homelessness, etc. areas even cleaner before. Clearly, need read international news then. afford anyways, let's pretend option. Also, possibility variant eventually leads new variants completely bypass current vaccines. 

Everyone vaccinated would lower spread, would lower chances happening. harder QC though

what QC ? fair, think Alabama particularly trying to.  may immunized either.

 immunized mild symptoms 1 2 doses.  v tru   studies that, studies doses manufacturer show safety high efficacy. ""Nobody goes anymore, crowded.""

-Yogi Berra giving way much credit. massive vaccine hesitancy Eastern Europe. many countries walk get dose, even Pfizer, independent age demand low. Distrust authorities, ""I need it, covid trivial"" attitude, misinformation play role. last time intubated surgery dislocated jaw. fun. 1 11 ICU seem overwhelmingly mild me. vaccines better, cheaper, faster, testing help lot. everyone take like pregnancy test morning could probably squash thing alone. shit? Lol required wear mask outside SF anymore, get weird looks occasional comment wear one.

This experience wearing mask outdoors since CDC guidance first came (I fully vaccinated point). Maybe depends City live right GGP walk/jog park days vast majority people wearing masks. It'll fifth permanent human coronavirus nasty one that. OC43 relatively recently introduced humans, likely cattle, late 1890s (""Russian flu"") still causes lot hospitalizations, pneumonia, death, especially elderly, periodic worldwide outbreaks. We're likely going need vaccine boosters decades. doesn’t matter lol. Percentages don’t care population differences. make less likely. excuse lmao, live bay. stating cool population fact. Son bitch! got… 2 doses vaccine feeling like shit 36 hours. Worth it! lot do, want fuck us spreading disinformation.  Cal OSHA still announced what's going masks workplace. recently made statement vaccinated employees could drop masks long unvaccinated person enters room. rescinded reverted masks everyone. meet 17th decide what's going reach decision go effect 28th. cost official standards needed dogs fulfill potential medical fields. It’s also hurting everyone. Breakthrough cases rare still happen constant rate, unvaccinated people getting virus, vaccinated people likely experience breakthrough cases. 👏🏻 nice. raises risk variants. everyone pay hospitalizations increased insurance premiums higher taxes. obesity viral load  killer

thankfully reached particular naming convention yet. Anyone know studies mixing first second doses two mRNA vaccines?   Yeah, Seattleites way overcautious bunch, least stems excessive concern self others.

A party bad idea. Seattle top vaccination rate nationwide, it'd well earned too. Maybe Inslee something July 4. Durkan sure brownie points earn point lame duck mayorship. So, anti-vaxx, pro-wax? Toronto people philly, worse access vaccines hit 89% first doses. What’s excuse. priority access us.  get sick end hospital ask, vaccine/s? answer refused take it, kindly firmly chuck street refuse treat them... simple. Let Darwinism play them. Sure, believe they're /allowed/ relatively ""normal"" shows.

My job requiring us customers wear masks still, to. percentage talking here? vaccinated people least 1 dose. also better businesses suddenly dropping restrictions. Demand rapidly outstrip supply, given future date gives businesses time find bring back staff, restart regular orders suppliers, etc. puts less stress system, equals better experience customers. already useful mitigations nothing. school wipe desks, tables, pens, doorknobs many times per day, time could better spent. There’s also decent chance it’s disruptive learning either directly indirectly. Excluding course usual amount cleaning required due fact students messy. evidence made up? literally sequenced support cutting vaccine refusers basically social services. good first step. untenable get vaccinated. really. religious kids atheists abort less kids. Even die, thrive overall. wish data granular. positivity rate presumably higher around Taipei cases are. might 5% more, means local outbreak continue. 

I think Taiwan lucky strain much infectious Delta/Indian strain. Guangzhou literally testing millions people still keep finding handful cases every single day couple weeks now. “We strong weakest country.” like 👏🏻 Block SIM card. even read title?

^/s Well i'll be.... nobody could guessed that! Drink home  would probably north 1 million AZ thing  guys love lines Canada hit 70% one dose across whole country. course second dose numbers hot garbage bodes well homeless people conspicuous actual numbers - conspicuous. One neighbors doctor town vaccinate back January. volunteered local nursing home test enter. came back covid positive. Never symptoms all. none three kids ever infected. yeah, vaccines aren’t 100% know, even get infected appears case could mild Yup. considering Iceland almost covid cases, though ... I'd suspicious studies remote island. kids get sick, cannot spread it.

And - wear masks? many brought outside spread school?

So, know one study, might different. But, many studies heard kid - kid wearing masks, small community transmission, done school place.

Real world data: one here: free do, long don’t make fearful harming it. lost grandmother 17 years ago hot damn could one two years her... people saying shit like deserve elders. Seems unfair got time elders grandma vaccines used Chile way less efficacious vaccines used Chile.

Impressive. people think they're arbiters human behavior vicinity.

*Nailed it.* Well said! 'hot' meant areas lot community spread.

Which measures general hygiene 'way overboard'? articulate exactly wrong wiping doorknobs alcohol periodically? goal vaccine stimulate specific immune response target target doesn’t necessarily virus. effective vaccines bacterial illnesses like tetanus cholera too.

Your immune system tries identify eliminate abnormal looking cells plays important role preventing development many cancers theory cancer vaccine might possible. decades research showing it’s unlikely happen anytime soon ever though. you! respect others well way described masks opinions well. It’s right condescending towards people differing opinions you. Forget ""your community"", sounds like many family members can't accept cause death. fit world view they've become invested.

Every death deserves sympathy, know intellectually, emotionally I'm tapped comes people thought hoax. Thank you. honest good faith question.


I'm actually kinda surprised response getting.

I know homeless population 1%.


And sure undocumented, good.

Thank Agreed. didn’t know. thought certain groups US shunned vaccines. Cries Texas care? can’t bothered get free, easy attain, LIFE SAVING vaccine responsible people suffer? lockdowns restrictions. nah doesnt cover bases wanted cover, theres psychological philosophical aspect too. plenty people bad math mindful enough understand center universe numbers extremely flexible. dont count homeless sanctuary residents. SF great things numbers positive headlines. gonna least till Oct Nov 

Still think open fully use travel bubbles. nations. still getting new cases people still dying. Many people gotten first dose last two weeks immune yet. Many people appointments next two weeks get jab. might another 4 weeks everyone wants dose gets first dose. week NS started making appointments second dose. high uptake, taking everyone get first dose. Supply Canada still limiting fast vaccinate. got word week getting big shipments Moderna. big help. That’s true variants though. Can't talk people? talked customer, pointed 7-Eleven checkout line store changed policy customer masks longer required. Employees still wearing theirs, though. 

I see people masks outside. CDC still recommends masks indoors state mask order ended. community moment really want zero COVID,  
other people getting point willing accept 
 cases community,""

I would suggest people understand cases likely cases 22% population vaccinated. understand sentiment tired disease, gotten truly experience level pain nations Merlino prepared put number percentage  
population vaccinated he'd take lockdowns table 
 future outbreaks.

I think one mistakes made many governments communicated solid metrics. Perhaps Australia, whole, get high percentage population vaccinate giving metric certain percentage population vaccinated, everything opens stays open. incentive everyone go get vaccination people necessarily feel strung along.

That leads big unknown... percentage? Personally think percentage would require percentage vaccine hesitant included total number. People absolutely hate SF. someone says Marina dead--of places, Marina lol--you know they're lying teeth. 2 friends convinced caught Covid traveling internationally early February 2020 unable tested returned United States. doctors treated symptoms told maybe it, maybe didn't, really matter long responding treatment recovering. never antibody testing got vaccinated eligible. knows. I'm sure early infections never got diagnosed. need build wall along mason-dixon line. Life back normal everywhere America . OC43 crude CFR 9 percent. particularly dangerous elderly could said people bad math. want vaccine definition makes anti Vax.
I understand may reasons differ majority still group.
Kinda like denominations Christians think right one, still Cristian end are, kind of; King County still advises people wear masks, yet changed guidance, people continuing so. expect update come next week two, though. people wouldnt San Fransisco address.

Maybe them, common homeless people use last place residence address bookkeeping reasons. can't say sure level accuracy homeless people everybody else, probably right degree number may off, especially large amount homeless used non SF addresses, still stand said homeless people fact get vaccinated That’s basically said. AZ approved 65 anyone older 64 got mRNA.
In Alberta 255,000 AZ doses administered May 11 (to younger, lower risk individuals) compared 1,745,000 mRNA vaccines (starting vulnerable, high exposure HCWs). Since May 11 it’s virtually mRNA. without info cases, you’d guess they’re likely mRNA vaccine recipients. Oh mis-read - yikes.

Then again, considering DeSantis (and Scott) done marginalized communities, would surprised FL-specific issue. Something similar already happened. Earlier year bad winter storms cold got, people got asked conserve power even brief shut offs save grid. People like one bit. True. one friend caught November (they live w/ nurse) &amp; need hospitalisation. Glad got vaxed soon opportunity came.  7% vaccinated population AA

ok, much AA population vaccinated, thats real question. 7% population AA instance 100% AA's vaccinated. heart valve problem; concern kinda understating .001 rounding error. 3% not. think undocumented people done know there’s pandemic??? think they’re choosing go maskless?? Anyone get. Vaccine yes trolling basic info blasted every media since beginning. mention rental cars ""disastrous vaccine roll out""? great news rest us indeed!  Shit, go help socialize aswell, helping others on. Also friend mine another class help too.

Anyways thanks talk helped bit coordinating thoughts lessened worries $1M each? California able afford everyone gets covid need hospitalized, would say even minority. Even higher non-vax areas, likelyhood covid causing vacancy shortage hospitals exceedingly low right now.  global aviation (including military shipping) contributes ~1.9%to 3.5% world’s impact climate change. even buy carbon credits feel strongly want leave city experience cultures instead own

it’s zero course odd hill stake claim on. almost rounding error compared causes. family, including 70 year old parents, got tickets welcome Hamilton back SF August.  Anecdotally, two people know caught Covid kids last month. Lol .. confused. Goddess corona goddess beer. effect praying make stupid. smh cant believe bribing $20 hour go work  think people underestimate odds bad things happening (aka wont die rona) overestimate odds good things happening (aka definitely win $1.5 million dont, rigged) Homeless people wouldnt San Fransisco address. arent included numbers got things that's problem writing reading yea job, regarding school I'll probably bit qualified start probably need read old schoolwork. already 2-3 years experience classmates subject probably worry Yes usually resolves without medical intervention. much less severe AZ.  apparently worked since california saw 13% increase weekly vaccinations well 700,000 people getting 1st dose since start program 2 weeks ago Pfizer also inflammation concern based study Israel. count also 100+ per million, whereas blood clot AstraZeneca one 7 per million UK studies According current research, [33% Covid-19 patients got neurological (brain) impression bad drivers road -- Covid really make people stupider! hear wrong. thought clarification helpful anyone reading along. overthink.

Right fucking fault end situation. Anyone 18 healthy immunocompromised allergic vaccine ends hospital vaccinated idiocy ignorance got situation. … would working office? Popular treatment: polk st still dead, clubs fidi still dead tbh kinda prefer way clear, everyone want particular vaccine ""anti Vax"". People using booked vaccine dates proof 4 months weird since meaningless. Though would tend agree overall point still booking 4 months advance also weird. booked 1st dose sister yesterday 2nd dose currently booked October 15. Ontario. they're still pretending less vaccines reasons understand.

But I'm denying people wait 4 months. felt need point exception rather rule. international forum like this, people often believe really 4 months doses people since that's number keeps getting repeated. main problem 'I care strangers chose get vaccine' argument. Imagine went holiday somewhere &amp; car accident find get hospital reason taking get help due beds occupied COVID-19 patients region vax rates low. Variant formation &amp; spread another issue that's probably much bigger issue large areas world yet enough vaccine supply. US 4% world's population large fraction ready supply. going huge reckoning soon low wage employers.

Unfortunately, think reckoning come low wage works federal unemployment runs September. Yeah seems like priority mostly get one shot many possible, move 2nd shots. They've bumping everybody's second shot though since seem capacity necessarily directed towards you. herd immunity go % people previously infected people received vaccine? really combination 2. hopefully done BSN, much fool proof name, gender huge difference science saying dont need something science saying shouldnt something. Science says need apply sunscreen every hour 45 minutes isnt dont believe trust science, extra cautious. fill gas tank half empty isnt dont trust gas gauge. nah made pretty clear aligning cdc masking guidance 6/15. newsom wants white boy summer I'd even venture say, ""almost certainly."" Let start saying I'm policies one tournament Brazil need host right buuuuuuut one bats eyelid 7 tournaments currently ongoing country (4 divisions national championship, national cup, libertadores copa sulamericana across continent). 

IMO stopped, but, saying goes Brazil, another one ""fart one already shat himself"". behaves really randomly thats makes annoying. 0 notice deadly crippled rest life........... beleive source ""saving"" millions lives government response 2020.

If actions taken (no masks, shutdowns, etc.), everyone saying ""fuck it"", would lead (mortality rate) x (US population) figure single digit million range death. Well Alabama happens rank bottom education. dodger stadium allowing 56,000 people june 15th lol 100% pro vaccine, got mine soon could would urge anyone else well. ought clear, 5 minutes. especially important people can't take time work, primary caretakers little kids whose needs can't put hold. takes time get vaxx, bad reaction pretty much lose day two. (My husband whole day, ill effects all, 2nd shot.)

None discourage getting it, important understand *some* people reluctant procrastinated. I'm talking anti vaxx asshats. Laughs Alabama Haha, tried long hair thought going bald long hairs place. quarantine least gave opportunity try out.

Yeah bright side, literally better time awkward around people now, mental condition not. Everyone figity weird!

If readings advance, help take mind overanalyzing things pass time quickly. understand point making. Governments across planet stripes forced production faced great need. subvert private industry get shit done. 

Who fuck cares corruption exist? problem exists everywhere. 

So mindless zombie assuming market solve problems. 

The reason vaccines exist US government paid research. Vaccines yes, types tests types sites are. disagree..If weren’t cautious high population city, likely exposed it. I'm someone always dreaded needles. main reason I've never bothered flu shot.  

Last year went got booster immunization bit behind unaware.  virtually painless.

It's gotten lot better. went got COVID vaccine, hardly felt either time. I'm definitely going getting flu shot every year going forward. don't, pretty well (60%+) beta probably similar dropoff. Dude, wanna know many viruses hide bodys spinal fluid immune system doesnt detect sleep?

Get vaccine ok.

I astra zenec shot together b117 infection. runny nose didnt infect anyone else, kids, wife whatever.

Last week second shot moderna. ok now. 2 people people unvaccinated group Getting nice clothes, hair cut isnt thing shit need grow yea business done time. time bit problematic, much know happen :) get Yankee stadium. That's it. made mistake responding everyone. Prolly someone trying scam you. vaccines covered government, whether health insurance not. Cool beans, housing next.  Key word: Slightly less effective 

Since extremely US centric thread post. Guess country boatloads vaccine supply?

If Delta variant spread among unvaccinated, bad them. get update attempt happen catch it, almost certainly asymptomatic able transmit it. should. Yeah, agreed there, fact say ""here new cleaning guidelines"" either manipulative posturing media admission know restaurants might ""falling short"".

On practical level, I'd agree expect conform least base standard, I'm sure mostly do, still ridiculous restaurant say ""now there's Covid, wash hands!"" (and probably mostly were!) already anyway.

Just pointing ridiculousness rather saying genuinely think McDs conforming cleanliness standards set Head Office. Oh crap. really scary. Everyone 12 eligible. That’s probably larger percent population many urban centers San Francisco isn’t exactly affordable place raise family. Fear Uncertainty Doubt. looks like CDC website says rare happen vaccine pretty common catch Covid. 

So take shot odds slim take shot odds greater catch Covid give symptoms.

So yes. spreading fear, uncertainty, doubt.    depends eligible means them, population % vaccinated. Nah, atleast Moscow, definitely vaccine shortage. dozens open appointments day two weeks ahead. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The UK already 62%, we've even opened vaccine everyone yet. 40s invited, 18s eligible yet.

We're letting people jail without bail things like hate crimes assault, god forbid fake card: getting locked up. Define San Franciscan.

It's crazy honest question turns triggering event.

 Let's say 100 people residents, 80 people vaccinated...

80% vaccinated.

Do understand asked question?  show bar. Afterwards told us since vaccinated get talk random people. nice. safe, effective, ubiquitous, free vaccine. need caused pathogenic organism able vaccinated against. teach immune system fight cancer cells, that's vaccine. theoretically possible. fucking shit swear almost online discourse around SF totally made exaggerated. Haven’t noticed cities— seems like people really want SF fail get rid shit? think change name virus forever virus!  lot states fully reopened without enough vaccination cases flat rising. beginning lot doctors saying “you probable case”. guess better safe sorry. hope people don’t think they’re immune. live SF true all. Yeah financial district ghost town one really lives goes anyways. rest city feels 98% normal point MRNA vaccines PEG nobody know they're allergic first dose. know personally county low case numbers they’re also reporting three days week now. ability model variations spike protein chain understand could promote enhanced entry immune evasion, could encode several likely future evolution variants mRNA shot. 

As current vaccine pretty good current variants may still need second third shot future years.  people seem letting restrictions go pace point.

Some people stopped wearing masks completely might go back wearing Mid-Fall there’s huge spike cases, don’t think large gatherings make big comeback year “strict states”, still think people beginning move on. could use it. nice see India's cases drop like rock. 54k cases reported today weekly average dropping sharply every week. positivity rate also going well. way we've gotten comfortable giving real privacy corporate entities exchange lifestyle conveniences like location traffic data. probably want even family knowing every minute every day last 10 years, yet willingly trade knowledge away entities unknown relatively minor timesaving conveniences. Almost everyone already normalized loss privacy.

In similar manner, movements controlled restricted set systems similar fly lists moving around city province. Together easily employed fas**st state keep people imprisoned _without even aware it_ something unusual happens suddenly freedom movement longer interest state. Plus rest world unvaccinated take years roll vaccine.

This long game, folks.

Homeless people, less clear less 1% population whole unaccounted homeless people move needle one way other. don’t necessarily disagree point, expand bit asthma counting? He’s guy door explaining inside, confirming shouldn’t you’re telling you’re positive R value Delta largely vaccinated population I’m telling one knows yet.

Also, effectiveness number includes lot maskless people/activities, misleading. People still masks even importantly, met homes maskless, went restaurants maskless, etc. Also mask tad effective nearly 100% effective depending filtration fit. used/am using way effective nearly everyone using. Also someone wears highly effective masks goes maskless inside people lives people great mask usage would still risk.

Though agree overall sentiment. vaccinated maskless person far less threat nearly every masked unvaccinated person others health systems (themselves) based people used used them. Plus protection 100% time far practical eat, meet indoors, etc. masks understand importance, vaccination even better overall, far numbers reflect (not surprisingly). I'm soo glad this.

Chile proof dying Covid choice point (except countries poor rollouts). people currently dying would vaccinated wanted refused get vaccinated paying price decision.

But rather give vaccinated people freedoms back, government gone authoritarian power trip decided put everyone lockdown rather let anti-vaxxers die everyone else live lives normally. recent years, state governments also applied anti-mask laws protesters affiliated Occupy Movement Anonymous wearing Guy Fawkes masks. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Especially it’s required.  wear masks social distance rest lives? expression woman blue shirt thumbnail perfection. Capacity limits due state/county guidance regulations. state lifting restrictions 6/30, county issued “voluntary directive” asking businesses continue requiring masks people indoors 2 weeks hit 70% eligible residents county received _both doses_

There’s really need restrictions point. Risk serious COVID illness age groups right probably several illnesses. adults don’t get vaccinated, I’ll give thoughts prayers rest us move on.
