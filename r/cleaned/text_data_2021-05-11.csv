0,2021-05-11," doubt it'll much inspire people get vaccinated good marketing. Tucker Carlson far-right propagandists probably freak provide McDonald's free advertising  One Canada's experts said reason resume shots unless area outbreaks high. think read UK first shot gave people problems, probably anyone problem never went back second shot. Article mention used first doses, sound like plan really going hard hit numbers. states pushing vaccine hard mostly ones already highest uptake whereas states anything try improve ones already lowest uptake. Long story short chasing less less people states tens millions states less forgotten COVID even existed point. Sanity worth upholstery kiddos that's sure! Glad see mickey workers making guys happy! Yes months, don‚Äôt think science settled. realistically believe older person Netherlands expect access vaccine within immunity timeframe generally accepted follow infection that's never swim Tuesdays Oh second thought / don‚Äôt recommend AstraZeneca anymore. Really?! Probably already swept country like wildfire *5.3% higher rates motivate people right thing, works manner insurance.

They couldn‚Äôt vaccines short supply, change now. drop 100% CoVID19 coverage too. charge smokers more. old people. men. inactive people. people watch enough videos encouraging healthy behavior. states, people bad credit. sure create new category intentionally risky.  McDonald‚Äôs nanotechnology drink machines years doesn‚Äôt surprise seen numbers like yet. Really appreciable number people taking ICU beds putting health doctors nurses risk something impact us long reaches point we're building field hospitals parking lots stadiums going back decide gets helped dies. certainly worth minimizing reducing amount virus circulation. larger concern new strain making vaccines less effective cases severe could quickly strain hospitals regardless many jabbed far. Agree! Come everyday check this. *Indonesia tracked 25,374 health workers capital city Jakarta 28 days received second dose found vaccine protected 100% death 96% hospitalization soon seven days after, said Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin interview Tuesday. workers tracked late February.* ""I hungry ordered it"" think conservatives going angry coffee cup? Dry sense humor appreciated! Wait mean tell Kids get spread Virus? like viruses? Nooooooo Every vaccine works really, really well. need billions doses ASAP. understand saying would feel choose take jab whatever reason took decided split human race two groups. Would good thing? Would non vaxxed create companies hired non vaccinated vaccinated same. else could solved neither group loses personal rights. Bottom low end weekly averages hit around 60-70%. Felt pretty implied. Obviously didn‚Äôt mean bottom rest eternity. It‚Äôs dormant. exposed virus second time. happens. happens lot. See comment thread reminder completely irresponsible say vaccines 100% effective preventing death. literally hundreds confirmed COVID deaths among fully vaccinated people. Nothing 100% effective gives people false sense invincibility imply otherwise. that's religion could get behind doesn‚Äôt matter. See comment below. non syory 1.6m pfizer, 1m AZ, rest mostly moderna. Remember start thought 10,000 cases per day horrible! 

Some countries close 300 cases. gonna trend sure. dumbest, scare tactic story I‚Äôve read today. term reinfection means exposed virus second time. doesn‚Äôt mean get sick, doesn‚Äôt mean anything. could get chicken pox kid, month later ‚Äúreinfected‚Äù it. body knows handle it. won‚Äôt symptoms viral load insignificant. thing happening story.

* Texas (about 9% US) excluded CDC data, tables match national totals.
* CDC reports vaccinations 0-17 age group. 16-17 age group size derived 2019 Census estimates comprise 11.4% aged 0 17. Assumes 0-17 doses given aged 16-17. feel like majority people currently hold belief. overwhelming majority people talk daily basis certainly due state strongly supported Biden. sure was, large vaccination site. Otherwise definitely would. Also, things open back up, probably less entitled jackass parents play area. Thank much! convinced her! still need some. lot people got first doses waiting second, India's fire can't supply us more. data mixing AZ Pfizer probably June earliest. decision pause first doses AZ mostly reserving supply second doses. Sent, let know questions  happy see development. wish would also commit timeline rolling back masking/distancing requirements, CDC telegraphing changes guidance vaccinated people coming weeks. Oregon follows CDC mandates gone short order. shit together. Living eye-opening. Japan last G7 many categories terms inequalty, press freedom, etc. Every Happy Meal includes vaccine. Choose US-German one, US one Belgium-Dutch vaccine. Good old America, taste Europe both? pick we‚Äôve got covered. Thank you. 

It surprising me. folks wrong perceptions Japan! N√∫mero de mortes por causas naturais Brasil [Number deaths natural cause Brazil] Canada going allowing cruise ships dock anytime soon? First off, UK data shows risk blood clots even lower second dose

I'd like know data, UK barely gave 2nd doses far 40 years old, almost data begin with. data older people completely irrelevant here, hope understand that.

They decide advise 40 get another vaccine turn get vaccinated, I'm sure confidently say something like this. Still waiting Canadian criticize incompetent government ¬º much someone grocery store mask nose. 

As leaving Canada life bit complex changing countries. Canadians struggle move cities--much less provinces--but believe government good enough job people live half year without seeing anyone else need move (again) different country?

Weird ass logic. coffee boiled^^^^^or ^^^^^very ^^^^^hot ^^^^^you ^^^^^pedantic ^^^^^bassturds water coffee taste. Spermidines! They're trying turn gay! today Obama! Anything push agenda. Done eating bullshit forever. interesting answer - thank you. Canada 80 ranking cases/million, vs Germany 72. Germany cases arguably overstated due testing mania recent weeks (deaths completely uncoupled cases)

So overall dissimilar, would expect see follow similar patterns drop cases.

You also make interesting point Canada may delayed deaths keeping strict restrictions place much longer, cost? tipping point restrictions vs risk, especially plan keep restrictions place least end summer, indication borders open year.

(Don't forget Canada internal border restrictions too, least 6 13 provinces territories require 7-14 day quarantine arriving another province/territory) damn time. Starting feel confident we‚Äôll hit 70% adults  July 7th. 

IIRC, needed average ~580k first doses per day hit goal then. 

We‚Äôve averaged ~750k per day since then, number need average July 4th dropped significantly, although don‚Äôt know specifically. sort consider Fauci saying indoor mask mandates lifted soon (or even all) ""hell frozen over"" moment, actually gave lot hope end, sooner rather later. certain point, longer become responsible people‚Äôs priority accommodate irresponsible ones?

with vaccines amazing efficacy rates, widespread availability, high usage high-risk groups, eventually give carrot back ‚Äúplayed rules‚Äù thing crammed throats big macs. meant less wealthy Germany - hoping Germany help logistics vaccine campaign.  It‚Äôs time let free market work.

Lift full coverage CoVID19 healthcare costs someone doesn‚Äôt vaccine.

Make health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance factor CoVID19 vaccination.

Everything else sort out. mRNA vaccines risk, no. makes extreme sense wealthy countries use mRNA send AZ countries really need it. lives saved Canada taking AZ dose today instead mRNA dose 3 weeks. possibility they're largely counting deaths India factor 10.

Also, resources infrastructure West deal (i.e. refrigeration trucks store bodies backlog cleared). Maybe print repair manuals ice cream machines. can‚Äôt work home. Lifting heavy boxes mask eight hours day sucks, customers problem it, offer curbside pickup.   beat it. Take upvote. Canada may want anymore, stopping usage Alberta &amp; Ontario. fix ice cream machine? Oh yeah, masks indoors, I'm public health, taking seriously, blah blah.  I'm ready drop mask rules silly situations like outdoors restaurants people wearing 5 minutes. It‚Äôs educated guesses based data evidence That's totally fine, expect others Respect Would like Extra Zeneca McPfizer? Sometimes worry lower cases spring, know. Like last year. 

And worry get fall spike again.

But... heres hoping CDC probably going approve Pfizer 12-15 year olds tomorrow, I‚Äôm willing give weeks get sorted. Huntington Beach residents suck LOT, yes, HB resident I‚Äôve never called given dirty look wearing mask public areas. people saw getting angry people video went viral. Got johnson johnson vaccine yesterday. I'm laid bed sick want anything. long give lasting immunity I'll happy even sucks now. never time Covid. That's simply impossible. always people get spread die it. Herd immunity stop that. can't keep pretending like completely get rid virus save every life. viruses kill thousands people every year, accepted lived normal lives. thing Covid.  Never military didn‚Äôt know, yea make mandatory Correct‚Ä¶

Either way arguing days. get large immunity week first dose. requiring vaccination students /faculty/staff creating bubble. makes sense use bubble.  Exactly. 

To clear: vaccines wonderful triumphs science. Everybody get it, have, personally. 

But larger point vaccines good, mislead people them. misleading. employees get hot coffee‚Äôd ignorant anti-vaxxers. guarantee it. 18-36 hours tend window. plenty people side effects might see mean way still could perceive way. guess they're taking anyway though may matter much. wanted able get vaccine least month longer.  Thanks it‚Äôs totally fine keep kids home. nobody force take stores hell, even public you‚Äôre worried. 
homeschool keep virtual forever limit social interactions months waiting childhood EUA wouldn‚Äôt surprised would probably take longer six months due low risk cases age cohort that‚Äôs prerogative

however you‚Äôll quickly find you, therefore going part small group holdouts scared 12 covid favor continuing business restrictions next months cases insanely small fractions been. kind like lady simpsons yells asks won‚Äôt PLEASE think children

have good night percentage population fully vaccinated 1/1/2021? think even vaccines, community spread still high, still high risk catching it. makes wonder long since second vaccine used J J quickly reach fully vaccinated status. know MLB considers fully vaccinated.

I would love know many ones caught fully vaccinated reasonable stance. reasonable stance. saying stance. since I'm emperor USA, doubt idea actually happen. oh well. Moderna symptoms began 15 hours later peaked 20 Yeah you, governers businesses? Interesting, thank you. Stop using adults metric. ineligible people disadvantage, bonus. Stop using adults metric. ineligible people disadvantage, bonus. bit misleading. many people vaccinated Jan 1? 

This keeps issue, people want use absurd stats misleading tout vaccines. vaccines so, amazing. really are. 

Do lie them? think do, great own. Health experts lol dont care do, seriously trying dictate advocated stay locked forever based reasons keep changing.  Nice try, Ronald. Chad_yes.jpg money intellectual property. One greatest gifts world America covid vaccine development phase 3 trials. federal many state governments allowing, almost encouraging, conditions viral spread, trials able meet number infections required assess vaccine efficacy quickly, otherwise may taken years, took mere months I‚Äôve one dose wife both. Still got COVID past week. I‚Äôm still vaccine, luck‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt see shaming itself. Calling people health risks vulnerable wasn‚Äôt way shaming asthma, diabetes, cancer on. People aren‚Äôt vaccinated vulnerable infection lack protection vaccines provide. worth noting cases skyrocket, testing capacity overburdened, tests prioritized people needing immediate medical attention, results increade positive rate, general increase severity among tested positive..
 
so lag tested positive death shortened.. would stop Covid logic though? amount flu respiratory diseases kids exposed kill far kids every year Covid does. Shouldn‚Äôt advocate full masking restrictions indefinitely them? bf none. sore arm. Please post source that. reports thrombocytopenia, seen reports prothrombotic thrombocytopenia mRNA vaccines.

These different conditions different risk levels. guess Supersize movie 2000s gave lot bad PR? pink chicken slime thing. probably caused lose business Canada also shortage PPE not? would helped probably helped. wish path looked simple seems hopeless. day one graduation closure college, rescinded job offers thanks covid uncertainty, moving back parents, stimulus, job finally get faceless Skype calls. :/ easy install pool backyard. India counting latest day possible made available everyone.

Almost everywhere could get late March / Early April since supply high point. Many states also opened everyone around well. I'm used masks even notice anymore. really mind wearing masks (even though doses) got used it. People can't arsed read free coffee card things work, way reading vaccine. Million per day ""society wait already got vaccine lol"" Yeah, too.  This.

I keep seeing people shitting people places like San Francisco wearing masks walking around, but:

1) hurting you, what's problem?; and

2) people walking around dense city going indoor establishment. maybe want keep putting taking time. Don‚Äôt think state blocked schools mandating vaccines yet, could wrong tho That‚Äôs I‚Äôm now. don‚Äôt want vaccinated, best luck you. 

The rest us freely resume whatever want do. happen get COVID, good luck/thoughts prayers would hear response ""I immune system."" come update. Thank you! There‚Äôs literally reason require masks you‚Äôre also requiring vaccines. Maybe masks first month ensure everyone fully vaccinated it‚Äôs safety theater keeping around Every person walking around indoors without mask potentially threat children. Personally, bring kids stores mask mandates dropped. I‚Äôm really hopeful mandates stay place kids vaccinated. fully favor dropping capacity restrictions. It‚Äôs indoor masking think keep place longer time. I'll let boss know  Sorry replying old comment; i‚Äôm much agreement last sentence cant resist.

The comparison unintentional accidents weird me. Literally, wearing mask somehow gets scientifically proven reduce chance getting unintentional car accident, I‚Äôd wear like‚Ä¶. oh right, seatbelts. cant say ‚Äúhey, wearing mask reduce chances kids (or anyone) getting covid‚Äù it..

We dont say ‚Äúwell you‚Äôre likely die stroke car accident wear seat belt?‚Äù Thank answer.

Yikes -- even think damage crematorium due sheer number uses day. or-eh-gun goto  figure crowded bar probably full bunch unvaccinated people since can't really keep masked good idea right now. people vaccinated amount community spread continues decline, think it'll matter much. weeks think I'll fine going bars restaurants. advice would keep eye number cases area along vaccination rate use guide choices. come one needs promote TDAP coffee cup? Why? already force take billion shots. give lot personal rights liberties join military. back work can't imagine without vaccine. anxiety would killed see. Thanks info. *Slow clap.* ""I'm want put crap body!""

*scarfs mcgriddle mcmuffin* I‚Äôve lived life pronounce Ore-eh-gun tough, long 15mos. walked paths &amp; everyone's experience different. 

I encourage find *your* way it. get shot &amp; plan travel again. first big trip 2 weeks (9 days Mexico.)

I hope find works you. Even though always easy see, brighter days ahead. Point‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚ÄîYou sake people time world get vaccines chose to.

Not ""just"". Unfortunately, people cannot vaccinated. allergies health conditions prohibit vaccinations.

But, also, vaccines work everybody. That's ""herd immunity"" matters. everyone gets vaccinated, people vaccine take protected herd immunity.

There people get vaccinated, follow guidelines, recommendations restrictions, they'll still get sick spread Covid around.

And, entire time virus spreading, mutating. So, can't knock infection altogether, expect variants emerge work we've done could wasted.

I agree, I'd like get back normal, feel little relieved half vaccinated myself, I'm still cautious see herd immunity take hold.  Ora-gun closer

Though Oregonian e sound (Or-e-go-nee-an)  doesn‚Äôt cover car fatalities either, it‚Äôs suicides. basically CDC said already. vaccinated, meet indoors vaccinated people without mask.

&amp;#x200B;

Which finally visited mother twice last two weeks, indoor unmasked. 

I'm still going f'in bar crowded people, though. 

People need figure really important them, unnecessary risk. promote Pro- act thier cups, might help employees more. look like propaganda all. 

Also, fence, health information MCDONALDS going tip me.off side It‚Äôs UNNECESSARY deaths would added absolutely single death unacceptable easily preventable. 4th wave? Lol production infinite it‚Äôs function time virus spreads rarely surfaces. primarily spreads aerosols hang air indoor spaces. aware constantly disinfecting surfaces probably little nothing preventing covid spread. better finding ways ventilate indoor spaces. easing super concerned/paranoid. India outbreak variants causing go back thinking worse case scenario. I‚Äôd Pfizer already partner AZ relieved protected. would taken offered like did. first vaccine shot? think correlation coincidence? So, vaccinations 100% protective. fact, variants 75% protective. get flu shots already bad upgrade anti-maskers yell ""freedom wear want wear"" see someone mask strictly required, people want dictate people wear. foreign students enter without mostly get states United States, 62% personal bankruptcies result ""freedom"" government sponsored healthcare. I'm highly skeptical India even recording cases deaths degree accuracy, let alone capable detecting kind decline. Let‚Äôs hope, lawsuits happens didn‚Äôt issues night second shot mine 9am too. remember getting chills around bed time. article acknowledges still know extent that's case, although looking promising far. know, wearing mask around unvaccinated people *may* prevent spread help prevent breakthrough cases. ultimate goal reduce amount virus going around logical thing right even later turns risk transmission vaccinated people every bit low we're hoping early data suggests. anybody need this? Yeah, wonder will. thinks so, I'm optimistic. everyone able vaccinated due health conditions; people rely herd immunity protect them. 

But real problem vaccines work everyone. Even vaccinated, might immune. means could carry virus spread others, asymptomatic it. could get ill. way know vaccine effective test immune response (look antibodies, T-cells, etc). can't test everyone. vaccinated people immune, know are.

This really herd immunity important. I'll bet there's good number students age waiting finals over. One kids due 2nd moderna yesterday postponing Friday finals over.  said would adhere CDC recommendations masking requirements could dropped. hold words. Still sucks get exposed like vaccine 100% reliable. gotten vaccine yet (live Europe). last month meeting. First one months, guy tested negative well neither sick.

Yet still got covid dude turned covid also asymptomatic yet could still infect people.

Moral story, get fucking vaccinated people, worst thing covid loss smell taste still mostly gone. Yeah, extremely small portion. actually Alberta right third wave pretty bad, kind thinking desperate situation places USA many people doses already. think places relax restrictions - yet Alberta. certainly is, provided people keep guard little longer. it‚Äôs not, NPR site showing percentage total population, percent population that‚Äôs eligible vaccine (16+). 

The Washington Post site shows figures, want compare.  know 70% number came from, Israel virtually eliminated virus 1 dose less 60% population. Yeah October 2020, 100% hospital patients unvaccinated! think important note day like within realm possibility. definitely before. effective India variant? many people left industry, sucks. Gonna even since bands pushing tours 2022. Wish media made bigger push learned outdoor transmission low last year. put outdoor concerts, ended cancelling rest cause people weren‚Äôt coming pandemic. I‚Äôm confused, downvoted? think I‚Äôm lying? legitimately go campus school certain classes, rest online  got vaccinated flew Miami right away enjoy life. Denver slow anything fun yet. memorial day go Orlando trance music. want get back enjoying life people dragging feet. or-gun Washington Fuck yes!!! Lineup drop soon!!

US far less Children died COVID flu killed 2018-2019 season despite volatile enough killed 580,000 Americans since start pandemic. 

The main risk children vulnerable people around might catch unvaccinated truly believe woods like Unabomber?  understand them. mean, everybody control nefarious purposes.  breaks wear seat belt. basically risk point. Masks getting point they're security theater around here. 

Sounds hell lot like Boston. weird local McDonald's employees even wear masks anymore Stella Liebeck entered chat related vaccines diseases lol. thats want wrong studies saying Starbucks puts semen coffee everyone loves taste semen  good point. Hopefully waiving vaccine IPs help rest world.

Makes even disappointing many take healthcare granted. point being, take necessary covid precautions even fully vaccinated. That's all. let guard down. Could still covid... , seems solution problem virus circulating unvaccinated people get vaccinated wear mask reasonably expect immunity kick in. 

I 100% agree! absolutely ideal, solve problems. people absolutely choose get vaccine. want vaccine can't get yet. cannot take vaccine even want it. Vaccinated people infected virus even pass virus vaccinated people! That's real solution reduce spread virus area. benefit unvaccinated (whatever reasons) rest us well. Vaccinated people wearing mask, may signal good faith intentions, doesn‚Äôt seem tangle impact.  

Absolutely true. masks effective reducing spread virus vaccinated people unvaccinated (from whatever potential turns be) also helps prevents vaccinated people catching virus important places community spread high vaccinated people constantly challenged virus thanks bunch infected unvaccinated people.  

Mask wearing around vaccinated people risky enough needed (although suppose can't hurt really wanted to), wearing mask hanging around bunch unvaccinated people likely making irresponsible choices smart move matter look long virus circulating widely community. 

It means protecting unvaccinated (many become vaccinated next weeks) also helping reduce number breakthrough cases lowers level community spread!   

Yes, someone refuses vaccine gets infected that's nearly certainly fault, mean getting infected negatively impact rest us either. virus spread area everyone (vaccinated not) [will Yes, protecting unvaccinated means willfully unvaccinated people may ""get away it"" face consequences actions, I'm punish make suffer choices. 

Right now, virus still circulating heavily, wearing mask protect people waiting get vaccine help lower spread virus community simply smart thing do. number vaccinated people increase degree community spread decreases less less important exactly experts article telling us.

China hides world virus human human transmission bans inter-provincial travel, still allows Chinese nationals fly country seems one country particular could helped prevent bad was...  don‚Äôt lock get kids vaccinated avoid crowded indoor environments bad flu seasons. would absolutely support mask mandates flu season see effective flu. seems like absolute brainer me. it‚Äôs necessarily ‚Äútough nails‚Äù mentality. It‚Äôs so...‚Äùhey checked data, it‚Äôs wildly favor.‚Äù 
 
To continue, ""and give shit people community"". That's always major argument vaccinating younger demographics. they're completely selfish, risk death include risk long term side effects still study. Totally wrong. Look vaccination rate graph Chile vs Israel also daily cases per capita. Israel's cases started continually declining reaching around 60 doses per 100 people end Jan beginning Feb. see million articles asking vaccination campaign working. Chile's decline same. Chile's vaccination rate reach point 2.5 months Israel. Mid April. actually posted comments March betting cases would start drop significantly mid April based we've seen Israel. happened happening exactly predicted. deaths also spiked like Peru Brazil. Again, proof worked. hope towns Texas that. So, vulnerable lies baseless conspiracy theories? Mind viruses much physical ones. OK, makes sense. long covid vaccination? Wasn‚Äôt dip cases week? knowledge neither countries bad five Covid. quit ""record low reports"" sunday,

i forgot covid takes sunday's off. Maybe less 1% population legitimate reason declining vaccine (such people currently undergoing cancer treatment). vast majority fallen prey misinformation, like people think vaccine affects fertility (while cases women delayed menstrual cycles vaccination, zero evidence vaccine way affects fertility). still spread it? woods yet, letting guests down, world get back normal. governor making announcement today, curious restrictions lifted  could guessed :) convince money shot best vary lot depending dominant variant country. example, Novavax vaccine found 96% effective original Covid variant 49% effective South African trial. Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine 79% effective US trial, 10% effective South African trial. comparing covid  Polio ???  Really ? Majority population sitting asses drinking coke eating like shit exercising.   

Now that‚Äôs problem 

You know kills people Covid.  


Sugar. pet peeve mine: ""brakes"", ""breaks"". words confused internet. good thread regarding situation U.K. Looks like something watch, something completely panic about. Cuz 7 facial pubes, ton acne, anonymous platform project edginess. people afraid vaccine give COVID...people dumber thought. Today first day haven‚Äôt seen COVID case count tracker map front page NYT mobile app. one article Covid pretty far case tracker seen. I‚Äôm sure everyone sees articles mobile seems like big deal! front page every day since last spring. WAY! Yeah modern marvels, aircraft trains, sure make traveling faster doesn‚Äôt look happy it... read ago Ad5 vector harder produce. mean never going get 100 percent. fault taking long is, gonna reach point fuck em. barrier get vaccine going literally zero point available everywhere including doctors offices grocery stores free. point, get still get sick hard feel bad. gambled life. That's 575,000 Americans said. They're dead now, turns immune system always enough.

I've never understood sentiment, lots people fully functioning immune systems still die infections. im still allowed get vaccinated üòÇ (anti-vax mother + minor) Hope scan goes well get see little gummy bear! first scan amazing moment! north Korean guy? He's gonna pissed left out

Oh, turkey guy say truth? Exactly. people don‚Äôt trust getting vaccine. feels like ulterior motives you‚Äôre cherry picking data like that. It‚Äôs dangerous Rate per 100k 29.5 month ago. 21.3 per 100k now. sign surges spikes.

Also there's large comparison Indian variant U.K. variant, surprise surprise, dominant one there. Also seen studies saying deadlier U.K. variant either.

The situation India happening Super Variant formed that's titan others, happening vastly unvaccinated country massed millions festivals election campaigns got rid lot infrastructure made deal 1st wave pandemic. true. Oh rightt! case makes sense. used hearing ‚Äúcases‚Äù daily cases, that‚Äôs why.  oh believe say both... issue ramped slowly Germany, probably due ""betting wrong horse"". Vaccine deliveries pretty steady, mainly Biontech/Pfizer, pretty speedy now. near point organize ""free all"" vaccinations. due supply also due ne central system doctor organize vaccinations people.

Now enter discussion giving vaccinated people rights back. Like door dining going bars, vactation. close summer election year.

Chaos ensures. Suddenly ~40mil people eligable doctors office cant organzie centrally supply sometimes isnt secured 2 days make appointments. mess.

Vacciantion centers open great public, stay open people prioritization due preconditions Job. least while, maybe wven whole campagin.




In short. Millions people rushing want freedom back way channel demand. could maybe supply vaccines adequate numbers problems orginazing it. People get frustrated, try cut line possible, dont play rules. system brakes. People get angry wrong people (Doctors offices).




I confident major topic anymore weeks hopefully got insight :)

On antivaxxers estimated ~20% (i dont hace exact number mind) say decided get vaccinated also aure sure yet (maybe ~10%) (Adult population only) Huh. got Pfizer vaccine Rite Aid We'll happily welcome here! warning - love take care vulnerable populations, see reflected taxes. ;) 60% total population eligible population.  least flush Xi? Taiwan done remarkably well containing covid wish would get vaccinated asap, .5% done would hate see outbreak there. EU issued export controls wanted see vaccines exported (AZ vaccines specifically). option limit exports meant prevent companies delivering (AZ) export vaccines leaving EU massive shortage.

The EU never banned exports outright. variants ""variants"" ""strains"" present identically terms disease. difference treat someone one variant vs another.

Get vaccinated stop worrying. Cases declining US like every variant, plus identified. like variants likely come somewhere else outside US inside. 

Variants concern time, unlikely change time soon. Long-term side effects risk viruses. kids face long-term consequences. now, looks like death, serious illness, long-term effects common flu COVID kids. shut world flu? Citation needed. (40% partially vaccinated, yeah) Well like mentioned news anchor stated ‚Äúall three vaccinated,‚Äù yeah that‚Äôs lot detail. I‚Äôm sure probably nothing story. clear, study starts January, almost NOBODY America yet vaccinated. Comparing January May would valuable. reliable there‚Äôs near zero protection two weeks vax. exactly.  think greatly estimate resources average public school. disagree. understand demographics analytics people backgrounds capable ignorance. hate mocking masks start dumb ass figured wear one metros lost lot respect enough information.‚Äù

I'd wait confirmation they're vaccinated.

I totally see Mr tough guy coach secretly afraid vaccine.  wish knew answer that. It‚Äôs disheartening see everyone else state giving effort detroiters falling short. Indonesian already got vaccine. hope news update silence critics coronavac. severe. severe moderate. definition moderate pretty broad though. Someone cough fever would moderate. ""The estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface low (less 5 10,000), suggesting fomites play minimal role SARS-CoV-2 community transmission.""

The CDC saying unlikely person could infected pet. can't comprehend WHO, Asian members (some Professors Epidemiologists - directly successfully fought SARS way), LISTEN advice everyone wear masks!

 (They even showed people properly apply - Western Media chose run Story Countries).

The non-Asian management arm (ie: Tedros Co.) chose IGNORE science gave everybody false information start.

(What would Asian Professors Scientists know anyway... they've wearing masks last 103 years.) /s Woah woah woah [race certainly plays role likelihood Black Hispanic people [have disproportionately infected can‚Äôt comment anecdotal behavior, gets infected goes beyond behaviors. US vaccination level, also Indian variant present concerns seem place here. **Question Children P.1 Variant**

I saw scary headlines around Brazil children weeks back. see CDC dashboards P.1 live (US). able find additional information around effect P.1 children seemed wreak havoc Brazil. Unless missed releases/headlines, awfully quiet around much concerned parent young children P.1 around.

Anyone good resources front? I'd like become educated decide want address future social activities. spouse fully vaccinated, young children not.  true. trust covaxin among Indians vaccines available. I'm totally stealing shorts analogy. Faucci mocked masks first, much spread death early happened this? could said save doctors nurses wear cloth types masks. IMO, U.S., seem undersold benefits vaccines given ‚Äújustification‚Äù get vaccinated. 

Even people vaccinated, don‚Äôt good understanding post-vaccination, adjusted risk profile. 

It‚Äôs disservice vaccination effort. Detroit 22%

Non American here. vaccination rate low urban centre ? Actually, opposite reaction. people vaccinated vulnerable HCWs. We'd expect higher proportion people groups worse outcomes frequent exposure. 

I got second dose second week April, ""virtually nobody"" seem right me. think going declaration positive testing. people might get tested symptoms, contact tracing outreach, pre-surgury myriad reasons, specifically study. trying hard failing badly  shit Good know, thx! panel reconstructs early-warning systems failed agencies faltered, giving virus time spread central Chinese heartland rest world, humbling empires killing millions went. interviews officials, review documents close read relevant reporting research, reminded, instance, Chinese labs started sequencing new virus even aware outbreak underway. ‚ÄúThe time took reporting cluster cases pneumonia unknown origin mid-late December 2019 Public Health Emergency International Concern declared long,‚Äù one summary concludes, adding little else. mean actual scientific source (the journal article findings published), 3rd party reporting site  Yeah fucking weird Yes obesity, heart disease, hypertension biggest risk factors covid hospitalization. don‚Äôt address them, we‚Äôre going problem again.

Not mention obesity makes vaccines less Italian researchers discovered healthcare workers obesity produced half amount antibodies response second dose jab compared healthy people. Although soon know means efficacy vaccine, might imply people obesity need additional booster dose ensure adequately protected increases risk Covid-19 death 
48%, study research suggested obesity ‚Äì defined body mass index (BMI) 30 ‚Äì increases risk dying Covid-19 nearly 50%, well increasing risk ending hospital end game? ever rescind mask mandate kids school? says that's goal provided alternate names. geographic shorthand informative trying keep track decimals.  ordeal states might cost 300k+ I've looked number estimates, number different sources, range anywhere 29% 45%. chose CDC estimate 34.5% falls lower end range. study done Feb. 2020 March 2021, number actually little bit higher.   probably vaccinated safe, personally would problem going nightclub masks, even everyone infected.

You overestimating effectiveness vaccines then. clear, really, really good everyone get vaccinated. make immortal.

95% efficacy means 20 unvaccinated people would get symptomatic COVID, vaccinated instead 1 person getting COVID. vaccine reduces chance getting COVID 1/20th chance compared unvaccinated.  start things 20X likely give COVID before, actually risk.

And that's even counting fact vaccines less effective variants. example, mRNA vaccines estimated 75% effective California variant. 4 unvaccinated people would gotten symptomatic COVID, 1 vaccinated person would.

Putting situation like describe still risky even fully vaccinated. case helping spread means *reducing* it.

It's still valid sentence. many dead people worth driving?  know EVERY statistic, every environmental condition, child infections added overall known US Cases, etc. etc.. Perhaps kids are/were less prone infection death. However numbers slowly creeping up, compared adults. new variant/s widely circulating U.S. compared original known strand? perhaps kids starting widely interact kids schools person activities? Again, know. know that, thinking they're immune essentially say ""no, need vaccine"" going stop getting infected. way truly stop/slow infection via Herd Immunity vaccine.

Also, read link provided. informative, information presented almost 5 months old. figured it'd go straight CDC Website updated informative information. There's several sentences throughout page state, basically mentioned above. true incidence SARS-CoV-2 infection children known due lack widespread testing prioritization testing adults severe illness. Hospitalization rates children significantly lower hospitalization rates adults COVID-19, suggesting children may less severe illness COVID-19 compared adults.

So likely actual infection rate among kids higher. Also, less severe illness good thing (obviously), they're still infected. means pass along kids adults. get vaccine prevent infectivity potentially Recent evidence suggests compared adults, children likely similar viral loads nasopharynx, similar secondary infections rates, spread virus others.

 they're infected easily spread virus adult can. reason Due community mitigation measures school closures, transmission SARS-CoV-2 among children may reduced United States pandemic spring early summer 2020. may explain low incidence children compared adults. Comparing trends pediatric infections return child care, in-person school, youth sports activities may enhance understanding infections children.

This one right opinion huge impact actual understanding may relatively untouched far. true, Taiwan, New Zealand, Vietnam... Kicked ass. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll champion vaccines everything get back normal. What, Florida exemplary leadership trails national average?  Yeah shit , like I‚Äôm bored need know mean !? specifically report review indicates conducted independently? Seems like reaching pretty far one. five year old wears mask preschool. take snack eat lunch around table. also take nap. get pictures teacher half kids wearing properly all. 

It seems pointless. WHY? European Union catching American vaccination rates, also exporting 50% vaccine doses produced within borders nations.

America ahead Europe terms vaccination rates, could easily export even tiny fraction amount Europe exports.  California indoor dining restrictions well safety community people work places. know ending soon. hour half eat lock down. I‚Äôm sorry. dramatic.

And unfortunately, DeSantis support take appropriate follow through.

Immediately following messaging everyone eligible go get vaccinated. Go get vaccinated case counts drop, one reason kid wear mask school.

My first guess would nurse would subject much higher concentrations virus regular lives coming contact sick people intimate contact bodily fluids, thus increasing risk substantially (and were, rightly, prioritized vaccination). first couple weeks still edge, hard break mentality I‚Äôve year since began, covid way back head haha.

He brushed financial empire relies tourism. Hundreds thousands Americans died sake shitty hotels. study think necessary: group positive patients read passage aloud minutes room sterilized, half wearing masks not, see many virus particles collect walls done. 

It would put issue bed one way other. problem is, experimentation actual patients live virus going trigger sorts red flags way medical system set up, proxy studies inert droplets. still think ""the system"" needs way flexible accepting risk times emergency.  useless study.

It inappropriately looks period time starting January 1, almost nobody vaccinated, ending April 13, large percentage old people vaccinated. There's way tell conclusions reach conglomeration data.

What would useful know would percentage people hospital Covid-19 vaccinated. could, theoretically. practice, highly contagious usually, many diseases act like they're playing Pandemic hiding long time suddenly becoming dangerous. Yes arm Chinese government  shit.

Everyone posting OMG Chile rising despite high vaccination, China vaccine bad. crickets dropping. mention Hungary Serbia either countries dropped substantially. 

Couldn't care less China, Reddit's hardon country makes realize brainwashed people are. Hello, hugs side non-sociopath gulf. 

Didn‚Äôt know many people faking basic humanity, didn‚Äôt expect many illusions get crushed. 

Won‚Äôt lie, things feel bit pointless now. said wasn't? That's case months vaccines still proven highly effective thus far.

Get new talking points. maybe *you* stay home, guy. Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand Iceland democracies contained Covid RIGHT? There's entire Frontline episode China sat hands almost 2 months January study done? 70% may?  CDC's process allocation issue authorization issue? FDA already finalized updated EUA?

Some comments already realized it. Saying pandemic preventable like saying known better back 2008 almost fucked world economy. like saying people known better voted Donald Trump 2016.
It's fucking ridiculously asinine statement based childish pretend-logic fails take account endless stupidity pettiness human race.
The shitshown we've gotten exactly always going get. Maine announced day FDA gave go-ahead. think Sars Ebola MERS really qualify here, localized? 385-885‚Ç¨ figure comes deductible Dutch health insurance plans. Assuming American would insurance they‚Äôd probably pay like $6,000 deductible most?

I hospitalised Netherlands last fall. I‚Äôm US live here. hospital staff laughing kept asking insurance would cover kept stressing cost. first experience hospitalization, anywhere, decades living US must left bit nervous.

Dutch health care system perfect even cheap (compared EU nations), least reassuring me.  Obviously, think what's important government way negotiating power individuals insurance companies theory could get vaccines cost near cost manufacturers they're made tax payer funded effort. That's theory though, often times tax payers get shafted contracts  Yeah, asked vax hesitant friend parents vaccinated kid cuz he's 40's, said yes. Vaccines sold cost profiting. expand proven mRNA delivery technology might treatments and/or vaccines ""ethically"" sell profit.  Watching pandemic unfold really interesting anyone played Plague Inc. 

The sad part people Plague Inc actually listened authorities, solutions made. People real life fucking stupid disabled person, thus high risk Covid-19, shocked find many people think life basically worthless. Every time saw someone type something like ""they already sick anyways, even small cold would take out"" reports people dying got disillusioned people around me. Hold up.

It‚Äôs little complicated obviously vaccine created digitally tested. huge library viruses, also early stage testing safe mRNA proteins know slightly modify safely roll new vaccines quickly much less testing required now. 

Even awful government response time, next one won‚Äôt bad.

The government tracked every shot got military, including flu vaccines got town, long time ago, track stuff? feel like post fair. also California definitely everyone infected. LA got hit extremely hard winter, central valley also ICU capacity problems. areas close badly SoCal got hit. ""Everyone California it"" pretty bold statement even hyperbole. month two ago, states lifting mandates without dictating cities businesses could do, tone

In fairness two largest waves happened people started wearing masks... help little bit, hardly would changed much big picture pandemic. Shutting travel faster, extreme contact tracing ways kill pandemic early... 15 months in, countries still failing 2 things. many articles said ""will vaccines work variant \_\_\_\_"" past 5 months. media OBSESSED even though everybody found January, inaction (in Germany) February March insufficient action till today still blamed China?   AFAIK, vast overwhelming majority breakthrough cases people already weak immune systems (e.g. cancer AIDS patients).

Otherwise, lots talk breakthroughs usually underlying conditions, nothing specific *what*.

Really, one(s) concern [ones like 19 days 2nd dose, demonstrable robust immune response, still got infected ‚Äì could‚Äôve infected &lt;2 weeks second dose, variant could mutation helps evade immune system. They‚Äôre rare, though.

Israel didn‚Äôt vaccinate people already COVID, got vaccination plus natural immunity. US there‚Äôs considerable overlap, we‚Äôll need vaccinate more. Well done!! already 4 waves count small one happened spring 2020. I‚Äôd able go US twice, get one dosis trip. know it‚Äôs possible get dosis 2 months apart other? Also, give different ‚Äúcertificate‚Äù getting second one? real difference COVID adults children. need stop watching news. perfectly safe parents.  missed that. Even better.  wonder parent's felt one allergies health conditions prohibit vaccinations.

Very, very, still cautious see herd immunity take hold.

We might never see herd immunity. massive measles outbreak years ago herd immunity lost- that's routine childhood Immunization that's nearly politicized. I'm staying house next 10 years 30% country morons.  Same. son got honor roll.... fair, need high IQ understand McDonald‚Äôs. You‚Äôre making huge ass assumption wrong. 

My wife teacher. mixed bag teachers want person vs don‚Äôt. 

Please don‚Äôt assume. cares. Anti vaxxers dumbass pieces shit lol. ""I think people get choice."" theory agree you, leaving teachers school staff definition ""people"" here. schools open get choice remain home in-person. workers get choice think lot complicated this.

Why one person's ""choice"" send child school get priority another person's (a teacher's example) choice stay home? go health advice. McDonalds. live Bali, people really hurting tourist ban Indonesia heroic job trying vaccinate everyone safely reopen. Australia huge percentage tourism. going repercussions elsewhere. even close. HPV much expensive vaccine can't get vaccinated eligible one? think let die? sounds cold sick. new poll conducted Toronto-based Nanos Research points overwhelming support ‚Äî 86.2 percent ‚Äî strengthening public health care rather expanding for-profit ‚ÄúWith 8 10 Canadians supporting public solutions make public health care stronger, compelling evidence Canadians across demographics would prefer public for-profit health care system,‚Äù said Nik Nanos, president Nanos clear air, us don‚Äôt need Vaccine survive COVID.  So, it‚Äôs necessarily ‚Äútough nails‚Äù mentality. It‚Äôs so...‚Äùhey checked data, it‚Äôs wildly favor.‚Äù numbers article starting January 1st absolute joke.  Nobody America fully vaccinated, hospitalizations peak.  course 99% folks vaccinated.  hadn‚Äôt even hit 20% April. India assume official figures sample size tbh. know numbers accurate. However, official count shoots up, know people around it. Similarly cases low officially, people falling sick/hospitalised less. there‚Äôs additional couple there? decent sized party vaccinated people plus 4 people one shot far (two household) - much dangerous that? 

Sorry questions silly, wanna make sure don‚Äôt cause outbreak! Dude sure issues west seems profile white people western countries. hey leaving aside u need look facts never said one particular country best other. Even western countries cases reported everyone goes testing. Take chill don‚Äôt racist. Jesus Christ people interested etymology. People comment things Western languages too. back forth really frustrating. think follow example UK keep using AZ well. Covid still circulating; polio (in U.S., Canada, Europe, etc.). Tetanus transmitted person-to-person, chicken pox nowhere near deadly covid.

Once enough people vaccinated, covid infections start drop off. covid infections drop enough, reason take precautions. debate much ""enough,"" think anyone taken seriously said ""lock zero covid country.""

PS. data posted referring diff vax trial new flu covid combo vax. true. pandemic I've noticed many people selfish, irrational, and/or give shit me. really helped stop caring people's opinions Nope. still pretty bad.

Regardless whether vaccinated, people got covid anyway similar culture allows social distancing.

Hurr introverted scandinavians never speak neighbours large numbers small households. 

As western world.
And Sweden shit ton somalis, afghanis arabs live huge households. population consentrated cities. 

So Europe. There's correlation Finland similar population distribution less 1/10 deaths cases Sweden.

But Finland still manages much higher mortality rate overall, they've years. almost like Sweden dry tinder much higher population density 

Because half Denmark virtually uninhabited forest. 0.3% infected fully vaccinated

The relevance number varies greatly depending A. number vaccinated B. timeline vaccinations vs cases 
It could mean 99.9% protection, could mean 60% big group 

It's small either. look vaccination curves, single-doze-curve ~1.5x higher full vaccination curve.

I'm fully vaccinated still often wear masks outside public. Usually I'm headed somewhere I'll indoors potentially unvaccinated people. pain ass pull mask back constantly.

Even death, confidence intervals mean often impossible round anything 100%. 99.99% may many significant digits 99% outside confidence threshold. I‚Äôm always baffled deaths go down, especially drastically, icu hospitalized go up. Oh sore arm headache? Get it. That‚Äôs pandemic government funded healthcare. 

You‚Äôre strawmanning. 

Critical care surgery‚Äôs happen quickly Canada know‚Ä¶the hospitals aren‚Äôt overrun global pandemic. Eh, I‚Äôm surprised. gets _real_ redneck miles campus. makes sense.

DUH DOY Healthy people need convinced get vaccine. yo-yo continue Im 1st shot 2 in. say, let stupid people get vaccinated die off. fault point.

I plan keep masks inside around unvaccinatiaded people. feel totally comfortable till arnt full week covid deaths. Better yet, full week covid cases.

Until mask common ask people interact ""are vaccinated?"" great idea.

Get vaccinated, pay price. Literally.  /r/kidsarefuckingstupid saw video congress fauci said involved true?

Second, video, probably seen Fox new outrage generating manipulated video. comment needs seen more. quote this. Seriously get vaccinated barely wear masks.

I forget probably class college otherwise would give real equation. 

Note: also believe safe :) don‚Äôt follow belief west best although best areas considerable difference undercounting cases trying exclude cases. really need see interviews ground level people funeral homes explicitly say deaths even recorded covid.

That's efficacy mild infection small trial. strong assumption still fully effective death.  trust WSJ biased government news agency that's trying drum tourist dollars anyway. far example goes, yes looks like ""slippery slope"" type argument. taking known fact like need prove vaccination, escalating unlikely worst case scenarios (for example, China different country government US, culturally, historically, socially ... seems factors need considered want assess risk that). yes, that's slippery slope sense fallacy definition. Except children compromised immune systems. OUTRAGEOUS!! BRING BOYCOTTS!! /s arbitrarily picked June 5 months ago I'm arbitrarily sticking it.

At current case decline rates 15-20k cases day nationwide. Hopefully rate decline accelerate (Israel 55% weekly case rate multiplier one point). live US.

Reopening shouldn‚Äôt depend people getting vaccinated don‚Äôt cause excess loads hospital systems. Protect others? Ok, vaccine works right? worried take can; can‚Äôt, continue taking precautions reason cannot take vaccine.  I‚Äôm willing give weeks 12-15 kids get vaccinated, June I‚Äôm going start get feisty.

No bet go speeding road idiots throwing front cars either. drive slower, make sure wore seat belt, keep eye idiots. Smart people take sensible precautions. Nobody saying people leave homes, put mask little longer community spread still high.  

We also continue allow idiots blindfold walk traffic causing accidents killing people either. certain point we'd start throwing jail mental hospitals treating like danger public are. Right think necessary start forcing people get vaccinated punishing won't, I'd rather allow fuck rest us. Taking basic steps prevent community spread like making sure even unvaccinated wear mask weeks bring case numbers much easier. Hm Exactly, want hanging around anti-vaxers anyway. EU never export ban.

The US though. like June 14th.

Reasoning: April 18th every state US opened vaccines everyone 16+. everyone able get one right away, might taken week. 2 weeks, wanted vaccine, able get one.

From here, longest timeline fully vaccinated Moderna. Get shot, wait 4 weeks, get 2nd shot, wait 2 weeks, done.

This timeline, plus initial 2 week lag, puts us right June 14th week. then, anyone wants fully vaccinated been. Everyone else excuse, maybe good excuse, maybe not. either way, move lives.

Also then, 12-15 crowd received least first dose pfizer, maybe even 2nd. That‚Äôs true. thing essentially over. still find impressive testing much now. tested 5 6 times last year haven‚Äôt since December. I‚Äôd think half adult population vaccinated would bring test numbers. guess much lower harder get remember last summer. prob weren‚Äôt gonna reach anyway tbh University rules already changing reflect vaccinations (in Virginia). yesterday fully vaccinated people meet inside without masks dont wear masks outside university. pretty big incentive vaccinate, even without required.  

Also, get flagship university state mandate vaccination, give schools cover also so. C‚Äômon, UVa!!!! wish here!!! Thank hard work newfound appreciation it. got $5 coupon Walgreens - shot. Nice. restaurant coupon would cool. still speed reopening protect others getting vaccinated. don‚Äôt know live Canada certainly ready open ‚Äúany day now‚Äù. Eh. seemed like Justice was, usual him. seems get tired dealing washes hands whatever is. Justice said reached 70% vaccinated, mask mandate would lifted. near he‚Äôs ordered lifted June 20th matter what. removes one big incentive vaccination educated, Fox News watching population. actually like privacy mask gives me.   Nope mRNA booster vectored prime almost certainly going give excellent results. small-scale trials that...won't give results soon. least 3 months initial dose (aka split they're using UK trials) would probably best; antibody variety natural infection maxes around 6 months instance. mRNA boosters multivalent B.1.351 spikes seem dramatically better neutralization (per moderna's recent phase 1 trial results), waiting also makes sense.  Um excuse sir play exact narrative reddit wanted hear gonna get downvoted. Maybe try playing narrative next time? Idk suggestion. anybody actually run numbers figured much population needs vaccinated becomes mathematically unlikely overwhelm hospitals matter what? Yeah, here. I‚Äôm disgusted reactions many people country. last 6 months brought lower I‚Äôve ever felt. desire interact anyone community. 

These issues much larger pandemic response, too. Many communities around world saw intense pushback. Americans, though...we lost minds. kept getting worse. Now, I‚Äôm seriously contemplating leaving country. don‚Äôt feel safe anymore. Hard mask mandates still forced media hyping every variant sun

As someone cannot get vaccinated it‚Äôs made safer take it, say stopped thinking risk Covid ages ago called out, always see people view things along partisan lines (like lockdowns US meant poor people put risk, liberal?). People like take sides think things through.

Remember 3 months ago hospital resource hit highest peak US (early Feb 2021). nearly everything open want -- know point is. even vaccines, raw materials produce vaccines.

The US currently actively preventing countries producing vaccines blocking access raw materials. Thank these! Much appreciated. Mostly it‚Äôs indicative poor messaging. outside, 95% people passed way CVS wearing masks. I‚Äôm sure fully vaccinated, demographics neighborhood. would guess majority people *still* think chance catching covid getting seriously ill outside. don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs minuscule.

I know much nutrition, think protein actually help build muscle mass. would require work though, nuggets probably help. Viral shedding infection 4 months ago, non-infectious dose left little bit virus snot, possible.

But actually catching COVID, though expect mild contagious. One dose vaccine infection gives tremendous level protection, still even going 99% efficacy infection. need start referring non-vaccinated ""vulnerable"" population. correct, also group many tough-as-nails-don't-need-no-vaccine types may like part of. might encourage get shots. medical treatment vaccine Yeah really doubt strongly opinionated anti-vaxers minds changed message products, could actually see opposite effect What's ""bad stuff it"" find food mom-and-pop restaurants? would course evaluate risk reward ratio putting back person schooling. I‚Äôm suggesting situation norm, offering counter view post above. EU world's largest vaccine exporter. China Russia barely produced exported vaccine. 60 million AZ doses getting shipped Less previous infection? looking cumulative deaths canada, looks like they've managed avoid worst far. Yep.

First off, UK data shows risk blood clots even lower second dose (approximately 1/10th incidence), original incidence incredibly low. Ironically second dose VITT rate UK fairly similar purported worldwide VITT incidence rate mRNA vaccines (Pfizer think part - get dose yourself. 

Secondly, I'm front-line healthcare worker got Pfizer AZ even approved given Canada, really get choice though absolutely would taken AZ first vaccine offered me. mom opportunity get AZ wait maybe get mRNA wholehearted told take first vaccine available her. mRNA vaccines also incidence VITT associated anyways lower incidence rate widely publicized AZ. 


Thirdly, concerned blood clot risk, take first shot AZ first place? concerns known now, presumably gave informed consent. way going give AZ anyone else. 

They're currently deciding ""reviewing data"". guess they'll see incidence VITT much lower second doses reserve future AZ deliveries second doses AZ people 1) actually use supply they'll continue get 2) UK study studying mixing doses pretty small sample size human trial (only 2,000 people). disappointed offered second dose AZ. also pollute yards gardens shit.

""After initial injection case numbers increased day 8 declining low levels day 21. **Estimated vaccine effectiveness pretty much 0 day 14 rose 90% day 21 levelling off**. cause initial surge infection risk unknown may related people less cautious maintaining protective behaviours soon injection."" likely explanation gap: trial volunteers told, behaved exactly get vaccine, saw steady rise protection. real life vaccine recipients dropped precautions soon, saw increase infections day 0 - 8, day 8-14 vaccine risky behaviors cancelled (resulting zero effect), 21 days vaccine won. ""for need take care FIRST"" that's rich!

If infects people, leaves long term conditions instead killing them, we'll fewer deaths, sure. we'll also tons people long term conditions medical care. 

That's still good, enough issue continue warning mutations IMO. 

Can imagine 20 years ton people hit Medicare age need specific Covid related care? 

The cost cheap largely avoidable gotten vaccinated. really virus, though. H1N1 strains, nothing identical Spanish Flu. best guess mutated became unrecognizable. one shot also reason enough relaxed? I‚Äôm hyped second shot, June 14th come! able get back mostly normal July

And less stay elections September.
Afterwards effectiveness used vaccines mutations decide might follow. Yes, every mention context 'Indian variant Wuhan virus', sounds smart inefficient all. asked question well: happened Spanish Flu? Eight men grandfather's battalion WWI died SC. answer got assorted history books medical journal articles: sure. likely mutated less lethal form, there's certainty point. would take actual effort conviction. people every social media app carry around smart phone day. rely government assistance even eat.

Yes calling indian, UK, african variant xenophobic calling chinese xenophobic Also, long term effects end coming society's pockets later road (Medicare/Medicaid), society veated interest making sure people get possible. 

Many people know getting vaccine insurance absolutely sucking system Medicare too. 

They see hypocrisy/irony whatsoever. Misanthrope works best me. NJ longer wear masks outside alone small groups. still going downtown since bit crowded. Also, spread went thanks holidays, demolishes idea spread caused people ""needlessly"" contact other. Unless think working unnecessary extravagance.

Nevermind Swedes isolate mountain cabins holidays, Reddit seems believe. there's time spend lot time rubbing one another summer. argument double nonsensical. maybe McDonald's could go business, would save lives vaccine. funny that's thing lot actual killing. hurt you? least you‚Äôre people like patrons store. pretty ill second dose much better leading country developing vaccines. poured lot money intellectual capital process. feel sorry reaping ""rewards"" such.

What ? first available vaccine developed germany financed taxpayer money.   better be.  Yayyyyy Chile's pretty strick lockdown reason Yep wife too. uncontrollable teeth chatter bed woke feeling like mild version flu. got 2nd yesterday morning.

and 18 year old give two shits abt virus knows whether gets not, life pretty much going since he's drop bucket. disgraceful enough oppress vaccinated people protect unvaxxed, wastes space like CDC wonder people want take taking vaccine impact life. think we'll ever get herd immunity, least America. best we'll get point enough people vaccinated virus still play threat today. There's enough people refuse get vaccinated ensure virus stay, thus we'll never get textbook definition herd immunity. government already giving away millions doses

Your government giving away barely anything opposed [other big vaccine 

America first best statement want really rooted science PR.

Because people trumpet 0.01% percent whatever still die sue CDC saying said Grandma would safe without mask dead. fully agree last part. actually agreed incase manufacturing problems contact. 2 months moment. This. People always throw death numbers leave long term effects part equation. still obligation society protect children virus. They'll one soon big ask. numbers went *everywhere* summer, Sweden.

I'm OK wearing mask distancing kids long vaccine coming soon. group I'll feel can't get vaccinated health. unaware many people want vaccine? Yes, first dose give lot benefit, maybe long.

And since 92% get second shot right now, that's good indicator finish. going gym mask free?

Seriously, want introverts shit want do? trying dictate them?   trying find common ground here. 

You ridiculous stance. reasonable stance. 

But ultimately mostly line time. go, common ground. agree around time. know answer lol Well US also ten times fully vaccinated. *especially* true trying convince someone opposed selling. exaggerate lay flaws serve distract already trust you, derailed discussion. let facts speak themselves. kids really aren‚Äôt much risk. I'd rather see vaccine surplus go India vaccinate children home sooner.

The biggest vector child/teenager transmission practically shutdown year now. argument kids resilient COVID pointless half assed they‚Äôve essentially protected adults have. 

Going Summer &amp; Fall, numbers still low children teenagers get vaccine return person school, summer programs, hanging others kids, etc.. problem it‚Äôs tough define exactly ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù population. got elderly people vaccinated hospitals still pretty full. younger people get quite sick it, it‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs interest get vaccinated stop virus mutating something worse years go by. 100% agree though people should‚Äôve got vaccine got sick -that fault. (Kid rock music) GIT YER FREEDOM BOOSTER! (Eagle screech) barely doses left anyway, dumb all. They're receiving ton vaccines companies safer. shaming work though make people double get defensive? could see going ways. Or-ee-gawn. Long e. East coast vowels. reading articles covid spinning wildly control India... going lose shit getting back normal carefully.

US advantage huge vaccination program seems super unlikely big spike could happen again. caution removed, still enough unvaccinated infection spikes big enough pressure hospitals. walk rain thunderstorm safer alternative? AZ left go get jab. People didn‚Äôt take talk. true? Pfizer submitted full FDA approval would think suggests ‚Äúexperimenting‚Äù need FDA review Since deaths always lagging indicator, I'm tad skeptical new cases deaths declining simultaneously. remember swipe right Bill Gates‚Äô new Tinder profile. likely get hit lightning lifetime VITT AZ shot. 

How much time spend anxious thunder? never inside Bayesian credible interval.

If make frequentist confidence interval assuming answer correct finding 95% confidence interval expected results answer, get 100% possible answer. method analysis useful, since, well, resulting interval actually meaning. Hopefully even prevent infection, least lessen severity illness. That's great all, let's spike ball five yard line. Vaccination rates still way low parts state, like Central Valley Inland Empire. Actually think sequence strain time points. PCR tell it‚Äôs major lineage is, full sequence show mutations might characterize reinfection. new lineage might even fail standard PCR tests new one would need developed. 

I aware data showing reinfection dormant virus persons typical immune systems, although shown immune compromised individuals. That's true, I'm thrilled pronouncing Ore-gone? concur speculation. Especially amount people cannot convinced vaccinated. friend who's entire family contracted covid. Everyone survived except brother. asked got vaccinated yet. Hell no, replied, dont ever let put shit me. End quote. brother died!! father nearly died saved heros work hospitals. brother refused go hospital. one change mind. conspiracy theory prone individual. flip phone access internet. Maybe education. got rest vaccines refusers. Hesitant wrong term people wont mention. know are. sad. could stop dead US. ""scientists fake lizard people"" mess. guys checked Bing lately? Blows Google away! mean pretty much know (like virus) vaccinated immune system normal, can't pass virus.  

No, really pretty much know that. initial data looks promising, can't take first sign good news run it. That's science works base policy actions actual science gut feelings virus spread.  

Maybe might feel know better experts think ti's kind conspiracy CDC, I'll stick listening actual epidemiologist experts. 100% correct I'm hero trying protect others reduce spread virus. I'm smart using common sense wearing mask vaccinated. really healthy adult (still didn‚Äôt want get sick) high risk elderly, heart conditions, diabetes, high blood pressure, COPD, etc excess 160,000,000 global cases (everyone knows it‚Äôs likely massive undercount) see high risk severe illnesses deaths, much higher children‚Äôs

561,594 americans died COVID-19 since pandemic started. i‚Äôm comfortable fully reopening society high efficacy solutions widely available protect groups responsible 561,594 - 282 deaths

its absolutely bizarre protection groups comprise 99% many decimals 9‚Äôs enough people comfortable I‚Äôve definitely relaxed precautions I‚Äôm 3 weeks past second shot. it‚Äôs still bit challenge get comfortable 14 months WFH, social distancing, stressing covid. find waking day visiting friends/family indoors (something I‚Äôve waited for, months) feeling like something bad. KNOW haven‚Äôt, feels like brain little stuck hope feeling passes soon. they're probably diabetic. ¬£8 exactly expensive... Anyone lives Orange County knows basically reopened months now. large people care. there's Huntington Beach, folks get face tell much care. wonder much spend ads gimmicks employee wages? Usually decent pay makes people inclined care job. Ie food I'll drink that! fall. hit 40% refuse get vaccine. pandemic everywhere, variables still concern.

Starting next year would surprised factored in. 5G reception incredible‚Ä¶ article acknowledges probably unnecessary vaccines reduce transmission. I've seen tons people say that. important question ask looking study percentage population vaccinated time frame. I'm saying vaccines effective, study really show anything. There's places like town to. finally done it? I'm leaving May 25th 9 days Progreso Yucatan. made friends w guide &amp; owners tour company. 

Been fully vaxed since March. little concern trip. respectful/cautious local people's health &amp; comfort level. vaccines, readily available like US.

We excited travel again. wonderful things planned. believe area visiting eased many restrictions starting Thursday. McDonald‚Äôs acting woke, paying livable wage. Distraction move Whats sad military leadership requiring mandatory yet. feeling [coming soon Yikes Lol  What‚Äôs sad 44% military vaccinated Sounds delish Yeah Aus throughout really surreal. point lot people burden wearing mask small default, like automatically put seatbelt. sometimes people polite scare others, plan go indoors.

That's exactly happen. Aside 250,000 doses, exports allowed go through.

Not much export ban allowing exports. get appt? Nothing around booking 12-15 year olds yet. Again, don‚Äôt disagree. one indisputable fact.

Thanks advice. guilt tripping ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù trapping folks simply insecure, scared of, hesitant, needs go.  folks getting vaccinated anti-vaccine.  simply vaccine hesitant. They‚Äôd like see understand more. Vaccinated people terrified COVID speak fear irrationality, (in regard vaccine) attempting push onto people. see here, see news. vaccine safe effective, person wants ‚Äúsafe protected‚Äù go get vaccinated. that‚Äôs it. someone inadvertently exposes COVID, Vaccine job. United States, thankfully, want Vaccine, available. long vaccine job, need worry someone ‚Äúselfishly exposing you‚Äù. protected. truth matter is...the vaccine still nearly effective natural immunity.  dangerous person who‚Äôs unvaccinated.

We‚Äôve never built narrative around guilt tripping people getting flu vaccine, matter.  protect can, allow others make choice own. anger towards people hesitant (ant-vaccine much, much, smaller percentage folks vaccine hesitant) going fix problem. vaccinated population two doses, 57 percent given Sinopharm, 43 percent given AstraZeneca.

Pretty soon whole family vaccinated! actually...

I looked guarantee doctor would opposed giving got first time (since commonly accepted within medical community young people generally get it). talk doctor though. still think there's chance I'm suffering neurological side effects last bout it. one month first Moderna dose family member (unvaccinated) began showing symptoms, day got second. Another family member got sick days later (that one one dose less 2 weeks protection exposure sick family member). Despite exposed house first sick person 4 days anyone realized covid (first presented like allergies unvaccinated person got quite sick span week+), get sick. Vaccines work (as already know). Compromise maybe? Try hike trail? go outdoor Cafe? may help well. know going hard getting back ""normal"" little exposure therapy may good. Earlier Wednesday, Gaetz accused Democrats using coronavirus score political points President.
""Coronavirus belong political party political tool,"" said Fox News.
Gaetz pointed ""the relevant factual information"" would ""help us defeat virus, bunch Democrats trying use try weaponize politics President.""

That early March 2020. 

This mentality started culture war masking/restrictions led vaccines. Everyone politics looking ""gotchas"", ""slams"", ""wins"" party. Sometimes wonder would happened covid happened election year everyone edge. think would still lot death suffering, maybe would unity effort get past covid. WHO? TBF, make medical decisions based sports ball star, get deserve.  We'll see. 2 generations coming ready different approach global politics mobilized events greater historical events lead greater changes I'm asking for. Good. prudent start developing boosters given time lag takes get approvals manufacturing, let's jump gun administering actual evidence immunity waning significant amount. many media outlets reporting we're ""probably going need boosters later year"" absolutely evidence supports yet.  local governments South Carolina also explicitly prohibited relying earlier public health orders using state emergency require masks. Despite downward trend confirmed cases, public health official cautioned reopening ditching face coverings soon. Ron DeSantis invalidated county city rules requiring face masks, imposing social distancing guidelines. really simplistic take things work. seem implying people need directly touched things order influence actions/cultures. substantial portion southern US flies flags defunct country lost war century ago. American deny influence Revolutionary War modern day culture? one alive today knew anyone knew anyone knew George Washington yet influence political culture. also pretty simplistic take entire informed consent/prisoner experimentation/medical racism issue distill one study, far transgression.

Then additional issues persist modern day [like 2016 shows many doctors prescribe treatments believe black people actually feel pain less whites. Racism race-related issues persist today constantly erode trust communities simple slope analyses indicated participants endorsed false beliefs (+1 SD) rated black target feeling less pain white target [Œ≤ = 0.45, SE = 0.20, t(211) = 2.24, P = 0.026]. Conversely, participants endorsed fewer false beliefs (‚àí1 SD) rated black target feeling pain white target [Œ≤ = ‚àí0.48, SE = 0.20, t(211) = ‚àí2.34, P = 0.020]. words, study 1, participants study 2 endorsed false beliefs biological differences blacks whites exhibited racial bias pain perception similar bias shown previous words, participants endorsed false beliefs biological differences blacks whites showed racial bias accuracy treatment recommendations.

The vaccines literally effective preventing spread masks. That's cases going people vaccinated, going up, people wearing 2) fucking dad walking around grocery store without mask, store supposed know he's vaccinated compared someone else came in?

I got card received vaccinations. says vaccine got, dose, date. Ah yes, California, everyone famously employed impacted COVID, definitely working gig jobs pay work, scheduling interview interview. told experts use first months  I‚Äôm people still limited 90 minutes restaurants, maximum group size 6. plan change August 1. Huge swaths country still locked pretty substantially. prediction 2021-2022

1. Lots pandemic experts public health officials argue create permanent pandemic task force charged preventing happening again.

2. debated ""too expensive"" ""too late"".

3. Nothing get done.

4. 20-50 years, exact thing happen again, children/grandchildren shocked let pass without preparing future. saw multiple comments politics (I like torture then) tune 'well I'm going continue wearing mine look like republican'

For reason that's one lamest, pathetic things I've ever read.  called ""UK variant"" ""Indian variant""?

I thought decided stop associating country names diseases. No, you‚Äôre wrong. 

I said choice. applies everyone. Teacher, student, administrator, etc. 

Not sure that‚Äôs hard understand. people think symptoms ‚Äújust allergies‚Äù go out/work etc anyways. Dutch plan pretty simple. Give everything Pfizer/Modena Janssen GGD mass vaccination AstraZeneca 1st 2nd shot people aged 60-64. Basically little stock kept vaccine. deliveries pretty stable, good place. evidence long term effects mRNA vaccines? can't one vaccinated mRNA vaccine year.

But also main objection subjecting *all* kids side effects second shot know severe younger are. can't even get trial big enough find even one kid gets sick, let alone sick enough go hospital get long term effects virus. American full free access get protection covid now.

Some protection Covid available along many highest risk. Losing weight, getting exercise, hydrating, getting good sleep, spending time sun and/or supplementing vitamin D, maintaining social life distanced outdoor gatherings, etc. 

This apply everyone (eg, can't much age immune deficiencies) ""protection Covid"" never binary.  Except... Even happen, I'm sure media would underreport it, one would know measures effective, future budget years people forget functions funded, they'll get cut, cycle repeat. kind missing point here. can't keep restrictions place, ie go back normal simply immunocompromised people there. They've always existed major impacts society economy result.

We going open world economy vaccinations take hold, threshold going virus 100% eradicated. people infected (34.5%)

This first time I've seen stat. Officially, 33.6M cases (a little 10% population), I've seen estimates true number double that. CDC estimate linked correct, true rate 3.4X confirmed cases. I'm actually bit hard time believing high. seem starting estimate percentage cases require hospitalization working backwards there, never really say come first number. ""Seducing blackmailing hot female enemy agent.

I LOVE honey pot.""

But seriously, article good. novel approach trick would conspiracy theorists clicking truthful information. Lol said need hit 45-95% immunity reach herd immunity, confusing 0 covid again? 

Face it, misunderstood wrong. Move probably get downvoted this, think reasonable take. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs quite time yet end mandates kids, fall school year, probably you. need end point. Correct question OP put Modi, Bolsanaro, Putin, Trump (who wannabe despot) Xi, Kim, Erdogan.

2 weeks slow spread. point appear exactly religion you? salient point, sizable majority CA workers employed companies/agencies fall law. Well despots tend want report true number cases. tbh donations really helpful either unless sure organization donating resources getting used.

A lot corrupt people make lot money, I'm afraid Oh, glad hear it! basing govt ""wanneer ben ik aan de beurt"" web tool seem updated. saying positive, check press conference. 1) able spread significantly highly likely yet proven yet.

2) fucking dad walking around grocery store without mask, store supposed know he's vaccinated compared someone else came in? thanks WHO.  Oh rly ""Covid pandemic preventable""......

Gee, shit? 
Yes, Yankees fan, want anything happen team! :-) see inconsistency. definitions:

zero covid: virus eradicated infections occur anywhere 
herd immunity: virus exists spread enough people immune. reaches balance low level, almost hospitalizations deaths. becomes endemic. 
I think (and yes, mainstream media) confusing two. guess paid it?

The government China blame start every country allowing continue saw China shut entire city. 

My bf came back US Korean trip beginning pandemic. Korea small outbreak kept asking JFK didn‚Äôt want take temperature fill forms could contact trace like required Korea. laughed waved through. decided quarantine duty. point covid well known nothing. 

Look infected cruise-ship interviews. passengers baffled arrivals thinking CDC would intercept or.. something. word take infected self flight others go home. It‚Äôs almost wanted spread. seem nice. Lol. plenty states capacity US sorry restaurants half capacity able take day trip Canada (rightfully struggling) equal world shut small minority people. dutch goal give everyone first shot beginning July. Actually similar goal mention Flanders. According presentation Dutch government today, plan give everyone first shot week 28th June. 

For Flanders Netherlands respective goals depends somewhat decent deliveries.  People holding back testing: absurd speculation. case hospitals would affected would deaths. People aren‚Äôt getting tested aren‚Äôt sick.  Please stop making stories.  Politicians absolute garbage. busy fighting opposing party what's best anymore. 

Frankly, could moments away next one, might look like Ebola SARS less like common cold. climate change weaponizing viruses, need high alert. obviously can't assume politicians upfront truthful. Yup, seems relatively new phenomenon. Perhaps antivaxxers witness destruction polio etc. know... vaccines. Doh! got mines 10th. Felt tired hours later. Slept really bad first night sore body. woke up, drank water felt almost 100%. 
Now two days later, I'm perfectly fine. last long, better getting Covid. Yeah that's gonna happen. many people brainwashed worshipping corporations treat like garbage, convinced pay taxes make jobs.

I'm sure one could say that. There's basically nowhere achieved high levels vaccination low case counts country. 

Most school districts probably want finish current year current rules going take summer work next year's guidance/rules. athletes, coaches, staff, workers, etc vaccinated. definitely unvaccinated Japanese volunteers paid workers Olympics even aren‚Äôt stands. That's kind point. Sweden like everywhere else, original claim commented on. Something else happened Sweden directly aligns behavioral changes caused Summer holiday. 

The EU went normal first wave novel virus. G variant appeared spread like normal wave. went US started series waves States.

None seasonal based, erroneous claim. Maybe even much since multiple states passing legislation removes power state director health prevent state governors declaring state emergency comes matters public health. given multiple (female) health directors forced office death threats, might one willing stand say, ‚Äúwe need something.‚Äù  accept life full risks regardless whether vaccinated get life like normal person. would spanish flu affect younger medical advancements. also plenty younger people needed oxygen hospital care. [Pfizer vaccine effective indian hard compare considering 1918 Flu's mortality rate affected things unique time hygiene worse medical technology.  figures Wolrdmeter/Coronavirus: 1.67
California: 1.58 community never shut schools pretty much unaffected covid. Hospitals never overwhelmed small death rate. strange populations affected differently.  Source? tracker shows 41% sure, three members entire Yankee organization seem impossible, considering I'm sure includes dozens people. read it. point? California big surge...worse many ways. hospitals collapsing. saw it. Texas cases too. Attributing anything life absurd. cases time even Texas cases tapered little earlier. People got together thanksgiving Christmas. Blaming schools dumb. Texas mask mandate kids wearing masks. schools still are. People Texas socializing even thanksgiving. Californians plain reckless! That‚Äôs it. Texas study better children...but Californians ignored recommendations whatever damn wanted caused spread death.  Got it. wrote article now. Well big deal vaccinated athletes compete other? basically nobody wants kids wear masks fall, go get vaccinated team here.

But going say course. somehow apocalyptic movies seem orderly real deal.  4. eventually created anyway

5. disbanded ‚Ä¶

6. ‚Ä¶ pandemic. Reports Someone

is said, not? aren‚Äôt letting Japanese citizens attend sure, hasn‚Äôt decided yet. Facebook said would run gas, everyone panicked, bought needed, we‚Äôre gas moron handing medical advice children? get medical degree from? public health knowledge?

What joke! come time side effects.. 48 hours second shot take time work think absolutely fantastic! news AZ vaccine worried ever get vaccine. 

Can anyone allay fears?  Living Delaware far I‚Äôve yet see crazy people anti vaxx anti maskers. Everyone follows guidelines it‚Äôs pretty chill. Horray living boring state pandemic. news AZ vaccine worried ever get vaccine. 

Can anyone allay fears? FDA already approved it, think CDC‚Äôs role beyond rubber stamp? 

Plus it‚Äôs rna vaccine, it‚Äôs going edit dna, skips infection step. vaccine going make kids sterile covid infection. stop.  [CDC breakthrough cases (I rounded bit):

* 95,000,000 vaccinated people
* 00,010,000 breakthrough cases (0.1% vaccinated
* 00,001,000 hospitalizations (0.01% vaccinated)
* 00,000,100 deaths (0.001% vaccinated) doubt booster variant causes dangerous reduction vaccine efficacy could developed pretty quickly. concern fast rolled many people take it. variants start significantly evade vaccines can‚Äôt get boosters people‚Äôs arms fast enough, that‚Äôs going cause lot problems. looking individual level, population level. 35% population fully vaxxed, 46% one dose. CDC want outbreaks among unvaccinated. getting point enough vaxxed big spikes without restrictions.

You can't enforce mask mandates among unvaccinated, vaccinated required go along.

The discussion point decide reached critical mass vaccinated prevent big spikes. Personally, think there, least Northeast, way cases plummeting.  mean really? can't find 2 hours free time ANYWHERE 3 month period get innoculated deadly disease? care 15 kids, hard imagine. know going take lot time 8 jobs running orphanage? Covid lol mean lot leadership India choices made. track keeping check working vaccine program Modi bunch dumb asses decided ok mass religious / political gatherings. 

I agree disparity around world highlighted much series horrendous choices. India wind like this. China hides world virus human human transmission

When happen? going take vaccines seems like. new variants covid much infectious OG covid-19 was. Europe moment. funny, cause Seychelles report 0 1 covid deaths day, despite cases exploding indicates vaccine works. 

How deep must hatred would rather developing countries suffering pandemic jerk China hate? Holy forum fans? They're letting Japanese citizens watch begin with, pretty lame athletes one team going anyone cheer them.

Just make fair hold attendance.

It's fault anyways getting vaccinated. animals *become* McDonald's. Well one group expert group power approve deny medications country, I'd think fair listen to.

I problem waiting CDC recommendation today, would remind original comment said ""oh god can't that"" vaccine could make children sterile give cancer. definitely advocating waiting CDC Yeah know August hard date inspire ton confidence either. top fact Boston decided set date three weeks state seems boneheaded. still mask still get infected. survive it. utterly atrocious misinformed post. kids agree sentiment, honestly Cambridge resident could tell February 2020 one thing, would move Florida. things people recommended scientifically sound reasons: drive speed limit, eat meat fully cooked, smoke, drink excess etc. Covid definitely warped risk tolerance lot people.  literally peddling Fox News propaganda, even close year old still peddling it.

I suggest work reading comprehension read tweet carefully. state results *preliminary* investigation conducted Chinese authorities.

That *particular* investigation find **no clear** evidence human-to-human transmission.

This mean ""no evidence"", means evidence conclusive establishing h2h ""yes vs no"" thing. ""how transmit humans"" thing, happen lot ways, exact mechanics happens, still understand **to day**, need properly established repeatable considered clear evidence.

In context, really surprising one first investigations, even month discovered, result 100% complete picture virus disease triggering people. That's medical science works; slow difficult, straightforward many people consider know America views Covid split political lines blind fact countries East Asia ignored advice successful crisis.

What countries would allegedly ignored advice? main reason countries like Taiwan, South Korea, many others East Asia well because, unlike Western countries, actually prepared proper compliance measures among populations. Original SARS pretty much non-issue West, East Asia much COVID-19 test-run.

They issues people politicizing simple measures like wearing masks, they've since even covid-19. insist ""freedom"" infect people due culturally much collectivist mindset, one results usually high population density. Well...I think combination things. well remember making little money would regularly end last three days pay period eating nothing 3 dollar chicken pot pies. yet, taking couple hours riding bus get vaccine something would made priority, ESPECIALLY job allow work home.

It's necessarily ignorance people questioning making effort get vaccinated; experience. conceit see - idea people make decent money can't possible know like poor. lockdown people stay are. go dessert. I‚Äôm trying dismissive grand scheme things multiple businesses left covid sort understanding business owner complaints starting make sick. Bye. know much you‚Äôd realize it‚Äôs Instead refuting points, keep making appeal authority. Current vaccines appear effective even variants. mRNA vaccines 'dialable', even nasty variant appeared could jump pretty quick.

I think Covid serious problem developed nations ended vaccines, ended soon. like measles - occasional outbreaks among unvaccinated. end month pretty much anyone wants one full immunity (or minimally enough make illness big deal)

The 12-16 year old thing optics. silver lining COVID little impacts kids. H1N1 far risky children, didn‚Äôt upend society it. It‚Äôs frustrating little that‚Äôs acknowledged See original article... distrusted guy 40 years experience fighting infectious disease discounted previous experience.
It‚Äôs almost fighting thing first time unknown values. v.2 Wow, honor meet [Helen real life. That's clearly saying.

What originally responding took umbrage reason, notion can't open (basically ever) there's population immunocompromised people get this. completely farcical idea. people risk communicable diseases, Covid. We've never shut restaurants restricted international borders past. Therefor, ridiculous benchmark set.

And somehow people like seem think equates steamrolling kids? Give fucking break. Go back Springfield.  Nice! able get one 14 year old yet. Hopefully happen next week.  Lol. get tested hpv chlamydia hiv monthly basis go general health screenings. think testing kids California school twice month.

And flu screening sick study. makes regular thing everybody. That‚Äôs anecdotal all. Point is.. people don‚Äôt get JC aren‚Äôt sick.  secret cases floating around...we would see deaths hospitalizations increase too. Unless sticking lots dead people homes others self treating ventilators. president toss right pandemic starts.

holy fuck want stupid fucking country.  decade ago naming conventions changed longer refer disease origin.

How complicated? said August thing bound change. won‚Äôt take 20 years another major pandemic.

Didyareadthearticle? found shitty people right Trump became President. name point.  reason anti-vaxxer propaganda acting scientists develop test vaccines know facts, also completely ignoring vaccine tested children shown increased adverse reactions. That's even getting fact broad discussion ""chemicals"" ""hormonal manipulation"" useless without additional data back could even matter here. 

The CDC going clear use 12-15 year olds today. FDA already has.

If truly want spread anti-vaxxer propaganda, real research stop spreading nonsense makes think back OJ trial talking Jurors DNA. IIRC along lines DNA matched like 1 3 billion chance couldnt someone else juror replied ‚Äúbut aren‚Äôt 3 billion people LA‚Äù.

I've got movies could ever watch streamed directly television month less cost visiting theater once, living room easier reach much comfortable theater. Plus, pause bathroom snack breaks, adjust volume add subtitles actually understand actors mumble.

Even regular theater largely found YouTube, though going kinds theaters supporting arts.

Of course, there's also fact second vaccine dose time effective yet, I'm almost there. U.S. 7-day death average (619) lowest since last March, exception 10 days late June/early July. writing reports could doneü•∫ like that, vaccine skepticism went away... condolences. Pfizer shot easily erectify Yeah no, soubt thats going happen. Religion major player India, virus not. There's great response BMJ article here.  Scheduled go Fiji honeymoon August. It‚Äôs looking less less likely they‚Äôll open international travel then, even vaccinated tourists like fianc√© üò¢ love idiots hold ghetto-ass China's pandemic handling abilities higher standard countries. gotcha seem think is. Mandatory vaccines fuel political anti-vaxx ideology. simply freaking listen experts.

I think problem worse this. People genuinely can‚Äôt identify experts are. Given buffet style offering people giving ‚Äúinformation‚Äù, criteria used select expert completely moronic. Sinovac seems significantly effective Sinopharm preventing transmission based study, anyone know might case? That's pretty good point Hopefully one provide knowledge! gonna get even worse corporates making massive medical donations. Well eventually community spread really low, odds get REALLY favor. 

In fact, that's most-substantial way vaccines protect us, people focus direct protection. tangible changes - one thing expect happen least medium term (maybe next \~10-15 years saliency dips?) bigger federal stockpile maybe also states stockpiles. air anything happens holds length time ensuring domestic supply chains exist critical goods. even stretch keeping robust general testing infrastructure. Removing vaccine mandates wouldn‚Äôt step backwards unless believe countries without vaccine mandates behind America way. Yep. husband‚Äôs grandmother 90s parents 70s. haven‚Äôt seen nearly 2 years it‚Äôs heartbreaking. SII alone manufacture 3m per day.

It'll take 300 days population get 1 jab. organization mishandled outbreak information blames us inaction mishandled information? make seem better. read news article morning blood clot chance 1:55000 people made sound lot scarier stats. someone saw ecosystem collapse child (east coast cod fishery) studied climate change talked many aspects many people, surprised behavior pandemic.

We can't rely people make right decisions crisis. think need values systems place guide decisions big events happen.

Maybe wake call. surprised capacity ability better. Never leave house instead wearing mask? That‚Äôs little extreme ok. Great points thank you. Covid might worst case scenario, incubation time asymptomatic rates made pretty terrible. Deadlier diseases tend spread faster easier spot, plus deals heavy blow idiots we've seen Covid. people concerned covid spreading ""only"" kills 1% whatever number they're comfortable with. travel bans effective done first case, either every country impose every country. second dose 95 percent protection. get immunity. Immunity implies can‚Äôt catch COVID. RemindME! 12775 days ‚Äú learn?‚Äù mandates aren‚Äôt way go.

Right, need go way that's way already is. need step backward.

Also, countries benefit bunch Americans living there. false everything true, right? misunderstood! Hah!   example extreme everyone infected, realistically would nightclub 40-60% people would already least one dose vaccine, MAYBE one person would infected, two we're pessimistic. personal protection fully vaccinated makes wayyyy less risk. I'd fine odds. Friend really excited go see Quiet Place Part II last year COVID hit. We'll fully vaccinated (plus two weeks) time movie actually comes month year long delay, nice treat.  Even people living quite well affected this.

Just look many professional sports teams fully vaccinated yet. think stupid aren't, get why.   VOV.VN - Ministry Health (MoH) confirmed 30 coronavirus cases four localities past six hours, raising Vietnam‚Äôs 18-hour infection number 82.

All new patients detected quarantine facilities closely linked ongoing outbreaks Da Nang, Hanoi, Bac Giang Phu Tho, MoH said 18.00hrs update.

What I'll say human's well conceptualizing probabilities. Try think like this: risk blood clot AZ vaccine 4 million. chance dying blood clot 1 4. risk dying due vaccine 1 million.

This equivalent risk traveling 230 miles car.

Rationally, afraid things equally (taking vaccine traveling 230 miles car). afraid risk vaccine ought living entire life constant fear shit, captain obvious. India highest levels tax evasion world.

So it‚Äôs bit one donut, many many companies parrot idea.  peak passed states, stabalized, still rising!!

Yes, AZ failing delivering initial contract revised one reduced supply.

Truly incompetent. 100% participants study span month. mean 100% whole world forever. Look, someone reluctant get it, agree understand them.

Stop playing coronaviruses labs ‚Ä¶ labs international funding everybody specifically experiments.   think people criticized. Tuskegee experiments comparable covid vaccine. Hundreds millions people around world every race gotten covid vaccine. Choosing get Tuskegee (which ended half century ago) science-based choosing get Bill Gates putting chips you. experience here. family side effects all. us really sore arms fatigue that‚Äôs it. I've said before, another subreddit. anyone know ""modified smallpox"" means? I've gotten flu despite getting flu shot, I've already resigned fact may get COVID despite getting vaccinated. Maybe that's immune system works. hopefully vaccine make systems less so. Yeah? 100% responsible travel bans China. 

They isolated Wuhan banned travel soon possible contain virus. 

They not. I'd add selfishness list. pandemic also proven non-trivial portion Western world act greater good causes kind personal hardship (real perceived). Parents watch TV keeping eye kids.

Thanks. never said save us lol people act surprised vaccine stop covid completely.. last year alot people acting like vaccine out, covid cured. simply case. thanks agreeing lol also took 200 years fully eradicate smallpox, people talking eradication happen year two. 100 years ago travel still onerous prospect. 

It full day trip, one way, cities drive hour. idea travelling across America, Canada would take weeks travel time. times, world's population could leave house major city world within 24 hours. someone lives Northern California, honestly thought indoor mask mandate would last end year even June 15th date opening state. can‚Äôt wait get rid damn things myself.

Nice try though convincing though. theory, disease breakout. Guess what, know flu coming every year, still can‚Äôt stop spreading. Good luck something contagious. humanity could contained covid initial testing supplies vaccines, may well single greatest achievement species. Moon landing? Child‚Äôs play.

Of course, wasn‚Äôt known early outbreak, response everything perfect, ‚Äúpreventable‚Äù certainly doesn‚Äôt give scope initial situation justice.

A sample space 4 guys? numbers clearly BS. officially recorded 100 cases day since March 2020 country 1.2 billion. silliness. can‚Äôt fire whim like here. Subs mostly used manual jobs anyway, usually already hired called off-duty, always subbing extra pay. office jobs usually don‚Äôt sub all, unless absolutely critical. Usually level redundancy rarely need sub. Also generally hire people work absolute edge. Slightly lower salaries = employees = redundancies. could offer moms $5 Starbucks gift card you‚Äôd line door. Oof....I thought that, make lot sense hindsight. thought numbers seemed awfully high optimistic. Vaccines teens. Hoping end date mask mandate. timing press conference matches usual timing removal mandates we'll see. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre charge Global Pandemic Response Force‚Äù

‚ÄúAwesome! What‚Äôs budget?‚Äù 

‚ÄúOpen desk drawer.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing here?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd there‚Äôs pandemic? need resources.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sit take blame, like originally intended for.‚Äù This, would made internal lockdowns completely unncessary. Sounds kinda racist ngl  analogy fit. 

In airplane ability help others depends consicous staying way. 

Americas abillity help others (produce vaccine) depend americas % population vaccinated. Covid never hit hard enough hinder vaccine production. regret inform numbers mutually exclusive. ‚Äúat least one dose‚Äù number includes fully vaccinated. next 3-4 weeks, 47% fully vaccinated. real world data support notion 5% fever. Less half ""fatigue"" two percent severe fatigue. vast, vast majority people fine vaccine. 65+, 71.6% fully vaccinated, 83.8% least one people think 1/6 big deal move on

Those often, unironically, people can't seem move fact confederacy flag represents fought keep institution slavery alive, lost 4 years existence...

And South Park existed longer part ""our heritage"" twice long CSA. Argument authority bold move here. Many people studied pharmacology, toxicology, medical science extensively disagree you.  Two words: CHI NA demand vaccine drops US, get Pfizer 30 days got J&amp;J? guidance available. wanted good citizen obeyed told us ‚Äúget first one get.‚Äù didn‚Äôt get choose, I‚Äôm high risk group, got mine National Guard March, didn‚Äôt get choose one. thought would now, really wish Pfizer. guidance this? surplus, shots sitting shelf point. true. China fucked deserves blame. western nations (Europe US) fucked deserve blame handling pandemic. get fan flames spread fire escape blame cause already burning. laugh wait next pandemic turns everyone Roman soldiers. HUGE!!!!! would believe it? People say dont enaugh GPs urban areas. Funny diffrent countries work. 

Actually doctors work centers say financially work way usual income compared regular day practice. Luckily us, dont care. Sadly, agree. We're like cancer world, rapidly reproducing past limits body (Earth) destroying go.

I wonder future generations disgustedly look back greedy scumbags keep interfering research clean/renewable energy solely keep lining pockets stock fossil fuel companies. is, course, walk nearly dead Earth. *yawns*  whole point unique, we're awesome. Asia suffering another surge right now, nothing counted done. idea China actually doing, either.

Raw state numbers useless. Many states bigger Asian Countries. Per capita useful statistic. Also, much lower number cases overwhelmed Korea's healthcare system beginning. case numbers. USA health system proved robust, severely tested.

A lot Asia really well Covid, doubt. impressive. Taiwan island, huge, massive advantage. Especially US didnt teach lab Wuhan conduct gain function virus. would much less potent version COVID would eventually leaked there. I‚Äôm saying Oregon quietly myself. may age? friends who's kids (late teens / early 20s) issues.. everyone group mid 30s plus. people know got worst side effects already COVID kind expected. last point probably biggest. much half country likes moan oppressed ""locked down"", never actually real lockdown. anything like handful countries actually stamped out.

It constant sheepishness teeth, ""OK, week shut bars stay open serve food."", ""OK well we'll shut indoor dining restaurants still pack inside grocery stores"". near 0 repercussions anybody defying orders. needed strict national response policy, let states decide.

Ive following since first handful cases sprung China. wasted much time implementing tough restrictions, 0 enforcement. Even first cases rolling 0 enforced quarantines infected individuals. 

Not that, letting people fly China infected regions long outbreak. Trump never actually banned travel China...he banned Chinese citizens coming in. still flights going back forth months US citizens families allowed come in. Honestly wouldn‚Äôt worry considering fact prevents hospitalizations deaths significantly. people getting Covid still Johnson Johnson doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs death sentence you‚Äôre high risk. Hell grandfather law beat 89 vaccination. data support either. cannot legally replace sick worker *while sick leave*. nobody stops hiring permanently temporarily replacement, later firing other.

For cases notable exception parental protection, firing worker Europe absolutely possible. always *cheap*. Yeah got J&amp;J basically screwed. barely effective first dose two dose vaccine recommended anything first dose still.   Perhaps, we‚Äôd better weak democratically elected world assembly could least guarantee communication different nations. grossly underestimated propaganda affected population whole, esp America. fully aware spread, goodness realize effective getting people believe outrageous nonsense would put us danger. mean look way people treat wearing mask. insane. anti-science luddites stay home forever get jab. get plague rats freedom. empathy. Ugh someone got J&amp;J post fills anxiety dread. don‚Äôt know much bad news like stomach. got vaccine due high risk group, didn‚Äôt get choose. obeyed government saying get first vaccine get. 

Can get Pfizer? It‚Äôs 30 days since got J&amp;J Incompetence Tedros-led WHO. Nobody forgotten told world human-human transmission. Nobody forgotten Tedros aggressively persuaded world stop infected Chinese travelers going overseas. Nobody doubt Chinese sycophant - obtained seat China spending huge sums buying votes Africans. Tedros CCP mouthpiece. CCP knows well authoritarian regimes control virulent outbreak, millions deaths strong message democracies try considering less democratic. abetted process. Tedros out! Okay, mean choose ignore risk pose everyone else. heart; wear mask. states, 2 weeks ago anyone could come india straight normal life. quarantine, contact tracing, nothing. keyword react fashion. I'm American either, I'm talking America.  hard believe time trump fucked preventing this. 20-50 years, exact thing happen again, children/grandchildren shocked let pass without preparing future.

In 5 years pandemics probably never happen honestly.

CRISPR based rapid testing end technology pan (unlikely think) mRNA rapid response vaccines partially solve it.

We're also going know masks works keep muted think helps us too.  people insist waiting weeks get appt personal doctor instead going mass site. 

....you can't deny fact doctor delivered children grandchildren earned significantly trust anyone TV, certainly Army doctor fatigues injecting like animal farm.

This lot people saying. Every time there's article concerned declining vaccination rates, general consensus seems people can't/won't go way get them. vaccines super convenient get hyper local, people get them.

It's reason doctor asks, ""Do want flu shot here?"" get yearly physical. feel this, friend. It‚Äôs worst it‚Äôs family. It‚Äôs even horrible get Covid mother ghosts can‚Äôt set aside conspiracy-filled ego even reach see you‚Äôre doing. 

My eyes open. Tear stained bloodshot, wide open. think crazy quickly went arguing deserving vaccines awash them. appreciate opinion don‚Äôt lecture benefits getting vaxxed. Also, let‚Äôs say Gavin Newsom always science especially closing outdoor dining state months back late 2020.

But managing risk versus cost it, find acceptable middle ground.

Over half Americans first shot. can‚Äôt keep acting like isn‚Äôt vaccine vaccine nothing protect people. profiles look similar! like show one fucking person wearing mask. Like, helping you. Ironically enough, people downplaying virus also least likely notice side effect. Duh Various rare serious side effects reported vaccines.

So yes blame that. SUPER dumb. Hey all, reminder...if opportunity safely gather friends family, put off.

friend recently died severe, chronic, medical conditions unrelated COVID-19.

Idiots: ""If organization WHO's sole job help prevent sorts things..."" Oh absolutely. first day heard flue China opinion travel China stopped well give nation around world ok completely close borders stop free travel. article May 3rd. 63% people Seychelles two vaccine doses, 37% people virus two doses, indicating 42% effectiveness. good, useless either.

The results may confounded vaccination common people older (weaker immune response) higher-risk jobs. Sounds like written ccp itself. Reminds wonder 0.3% infected.

If work hospital caring COVID patients, airborne disease like COVID risk catching orders magnitude higher general public. Even vaccine reduces 95% probability never goes zero could account 0.3%. Gavin campaigning several hundred thousand dollars pocket.

what? insurance plans' max pocket like $6000 per year X ""Acting normally"" means wearing masks right now. amount arguments downvotes got subreddit making point lives elderly people illness disability less valuable young healthy really put spiraling depression awhile. eugenics never went away, wearing different hat called ""rationalism.""

able-bodied people like told they're ones put barriers society undermine freedoms abilities sick people. Honestly, I'm real sure they're even talking here. exactly ""study intervention""? know whatever they're talking would conjecture proven case. Vaccine shedding ridiculous. 85% adults least partially vaccinated two-thirds fully vaccinated beginning July seems even plausible goal first announced. become plausible come closer target shows everything finally coming together. 

Considering figure account Janssen AstraZeneca doses. Janssen still new know reliable seem trouble delivering time now. AstraZeneca always extremely unreliable. achieve goals, another 2 3 million Janssen doses 3 4 million AstraZeneca doses top that. Also, CureVac might start deliveries May June, might also used.

When adults done within next 2 months 85% adults least partially vaccinated, long gonna take vaccinate 12 17 year olds 5 11 year olds that? end, speed highest, around 2 2.5 million vaccinations per week average. Q3 even higher, Q3 deliveries twice high Q2 deliveries (like Q2 deliveries 4 times high Q1 deliveries). assume Moderna BioNTech used age groups, see 2 companies actively pursuing trials children. group could probably start third week July, second doses latest groups given quickly possible remaining doses used push last remaining unsure population get vaccine anyways. BioNTech stay similar Q2 deliveries Q3, Q2 deliveries already high. Thus 1 million BioNTech doses per week. Moderna deliveries Q3 around 3.5 times high Q2 deliveries. around 400,000 Moderna doses per week. Thus 1.4 million doses approved children available every week then. Remaining unvaccinated hesitant adults able get vaccines walk-ins. Demand low group anyways. around 1.2 million 12 17 year olds around 1.3 million 11 5 year olds. Assuming 85% group vaccinated, looking around 2 million children vaccinated either Moderna BioNTech. Thus group vaccinated 1.5 week starting third/fourth week July, ends July 31st. 3 weeks later get second dose, finished third week August. means willing adults school aged children fully vaccinated summer holiday ends new school year starts. Assuming hopefully 85% total populations wants vaccinated, course. mean completely normal new school year. boosters also given fall needed.

All EU supply, also exports massive amounts this. early May EU already allowed export 200 million doses received 200 million doses within EU. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

We agree disagree friend. know done done elsewhere successfully responsible governments. blame others government's choices ""not taking precautions would liked"". hard memorize sequence letters, digits, decimal points.

With exception certain Star Wars fans impeccable recollection Clone Trooper names. thought selling cost. Also keep mind outdoors. transmissionable outdoors indoors. impossible, chances contracting significantly lower, even lower CDC admitting could (even though want stand numbers): shitty teeth. I've able smile work year ever before.

I also like social distancing public. understand possible bars, shows, theaters, etc... grocery store bank? Fuck yeah want keep six feet away me. ""Mistakes made"". makes stories Americans helping neighbors survive great depression WW2 seem like science fiction.

TBF, engineered situation. Certain people *wanted* way, manipulated people it. course always people like (and always be), believe many people like normally.

None excuses behavior, believe many redeemed road. Whether happen another issue. Could mutation get past vaccine? That's article/study. That‚Äôs UK. States, call microfries everyone able vaccinated due health conditions; people rely herd immunity protect them

This idea gets parroted lot sub. reality accurately describes *extremely* small portion population. Can't adequately reply without getting subject banned here. short, nation divided difficult unified national effort anything. I'm waiting July 4 resume normal stuff without masks. think fair people wanted get vaccinated later roll out.

So, personally safe, going act like sense fairness? mean, you, that's certainly scientific. wife serious side effects subsided 36 hours almost button.

You vaccinated, safe. 100% safe never 100% probably safe before.  certain point, we're going accept fact everyone even remotely risk plenty opportunity vaccinated

Yeah, we're point yet. still barriers getting vaccinated: time work reaction, child care, transportation biggest ones. 

Other people think need insurance, need valid ID. putting aside fears assholes right intentionally stoking keep low information people vaccine. 

Also, vaccines take time work. Today *first* day I'm considered fully vaccinated, high risk job snapped appointment soon could. able get first shot soon could, fully vaccinated yet. 

We quite place poorest medically underserved around vaccinated, I'm totally fine wearing mask happens. get kids flu vaccine every year. 

I advocating adding new restrictions. saying relax existing restrictions kids vaccinated. different things. Right assumes Canadian vaccination rates hold. Eh, I'm vaccinated. I'll go bars point. 3/4 people city already least one shot. I'll wear mask required, pandemic me.  lot countries adequate supply coming months vaccinate entire populations much faster Americans would expect.

Sorry, think antivaxxers thing world? exclusively American thing. today, Covid. important get world vaccinated quickly. long virus active part world, still threat due mutations even vaccinated. always thing. person takes mask several times day probably poor fit, reducing efficacy, almost certainly touching front and/or face taking off/on putting in/out pockets.

Connecticut first state [have 70% adults yet NPR website reports 57.6% recieved least 1 vaccine dose. still wear mask inside required. longer outside follow CDC guidelines. I'm saying experts know transmission vaccinated people essential nonissue. people get vaccinated CDC admit this. Period. Actually prefer eggs runny eaten way 45 years kinds different places, diners, pubs, third world countries, etc. never problem. People way concerned wrong food problems. scientific reasons kids less risk closed schools. research showing younger children 12 don‚Äôt number ACE-2 receptors adults do, kids aren‚Äôt high risk. Also, kids powerful innate immune system. get covid community bring home kids, theory holds true, wouldn‚Äôt see kids dying infections families covid outbreaks kids risk profile everyone else? 

So yes, OP correct saying saving lives countries give kids minuscule risk covid U.S vaccines it‚Äôs crazy controversial opinion. Free market work health care costs. People think get incredibly sick, make decisions based that. Best comment night. laughed solid minute one. Well all, world's leading experts convincing humans put garbage bodies! keep anti-vaxxer, one cares.  Thanks! üç¶ Damn, huge. need wear mask people refuse protect virus?

GTFO talking specifically covid vaccine. sure many people downvoted comment, true medically standard protocol vaccine production rushed. approved emergency use currently. Seriously... make pay.

Ah shit link went generic CA site. get point. Community spread low at. 

Low spread + vaccinated? Yep, that's ideal go ahead party. 

Not vaccinated people ideal conditions. let‚Äôs mask up, social distance, lock deaths absolutely 0! even 1 single death cause go back full restrictions!

So fuck it, I've stayed home avoided human contact outside immediate family last year. I'm going bars seeing friends. Life going back normal. here. I'm social introvert. like (awkwardly) socializing friends co-workers. need go coma afterwards. haven‚Äôt sick year, it‚Äôs pretty fantastic. I‚Äôll definitely selective activities foreseeable future. don‚Äôt try clicking link? says first three words. thing Canada people stuff covered. Way jobs offer health coverage workers Canada things already covered, coverage relatively cheap.

There always people without insurance course experience Canada far really cheap. biggest thing dental since covered national health care even crummy minimum wage high school job gave dental coverage 6 months. Well people stopped going hospitals vaccine came out. rate hospitalizations flattening around then. key community spread. 

The vaccine two ways help., one direct, one direct. 

Directly, reduces chances getting OG virus 95%. situation 20 people would get infected, everyone vaccinated would 1 person. variants, goes like 1 4, rather 1 20. 

On balance, things far dangerous, like going bars, actually INCREASE chances getting virus vaccinated vs. going things unvaccinated. 
But there's another benefit... vaccinations decrease community spread. That's key, imo.  get 1/20th 1/4th PLUS reduced spread near you, talking big reduction risk. study also looked 47,000 Cleveland Clinic employees received one shot, shots shots Cleveland Clinic found 99.7% employees infected coronavirus vaccinated, 0.3% infections occurred fully vaccinated

Too bad dont say percentage employees vaccinated. probably assume decent percentage them. probably says study dont energy read that. Haha.

Anyways least good news consistent everything else I've read vaccines effect hospitalization rates. would like know go health insurance companies states charge bad credit. seems course sucks died. it‚Äôs less half number kids die drowning every wish vaccines free here.

I‚Äôm strongly pro-vax. there‚Äôs vaccine available public want it. want immune system shredded (not point autoimmunity).

But damn, spend $125 something TDAP booster couple years ago. #2 dose usually occurs mornings 2-3 weeks FIRST shot near-full protection. second shot mostly given ensure long lasting immunity point. Hopefully behind us soon. Hope dear neighbors right us. It‚Äôs sad White House thinks get across vaccine-hesitant people, ask McDonald‚Äôs give health advice. Tell everyone Biden plans give vaccine away China pharmacies cleaned time.  hear ya.

I‚Äôve done I‚Äôm supposed since last March. Mask up, wash hands (I anyway wouldn‚Äôt you), social distance (this wasn‚Äôt hard me, don‚Äôt like people). 

It‚Äôs job babysit people willfully ignorant obstinate. need either quit whining get vaccine move Poveglia. seems like great idea thank God US. think countries going Pandemic right (a specific one tons people comes mind!) people/States pay vaccine! potentially different prices, too! great conscientious government have. Probably waiting till full FDA approval, emergency approval. worry guys- uncle Sam gives new recruits Anthrax shots- long till covid shots mandatory Poor sods never got first wave üòâ definitely 100% inside Bayesian credible interval. Bayesian credible intervals equal tailed, correctly centered around mean around narrowest possible interval.

If assume efficacy truncated unimodal definition narrowest possible interval trivially include 100%, also using mean subgroups raw results 100%.

You get 100% frequentist confidence interval. Again, trivially, make simple simulation true efficacy values keep ones 95% chance giving results include 100% case deaths. seeing family don‚Äôt plan getting vaccinated? Never see again? I‚Äôm sure handle situation.   Great, dumbass karens start saying Grimace trying implant mctrackers them. got last vaccine yesterday I‚Äôm going continue wear masks least another two weeks body works immunity.

I‚Äôm hoping they‚Äôll tell vaccinated folks stop wearing masks then. greatly reduces chances, else equal. 

But else equal (lets say start going bars) actually likely get virus give virus unvaccinated far careful. I'm postponing bachelor's thesis second shot. Good luck finals though! wanted share via social media, thought figured what's point.

That's pessimistic know, soon people NEED see see CNN they'll ignore entirely.   ages 16-18 able vaccinated student population. 12-15 approved. schools still going pools mostly unvaccinated people really make sense remove mask mandates majority students vaccinated. Detroit: likely get shot get shot. Biden can‚Äôt force morons America take shots. They‚Äôre exporting bit it‚Äôs like export deals drafted night. PRC though.

Except gradual reopening based age three week buffer (40+ @ 70%, 30+ @ 70% 18+ @ 70%). Actually, apologize. Alberta far ready relax restrictions reason thought subreddit local me.

In conclusion, McDonalds expensive dogshit.  Ha, try introvert multigenerational household (my parents staying us prepandemic renovating house) small kids. haven‚Äôt alone 14 months Ah company rumored grind cows viscera patties definitely put people ease comes conspiracy. said boss?  stupid? They‚Äôre vaccinated virtually zero risk hospitalized severe case Covid. Whether cases high area isn‚Äôt issue. wrong him? would literally support criminal charges action like this. parents supposed month half school left? noted vaccine exact one age groups. 153 million people, U.S least, gotten least one shot vaccine, handful 16-18.

If safe see would suddenly different kids slightly younger So, acceptable number zero?

No, said ""any **appreciable** number people"" 'any number people'.  

Even one person taking limited ICU space needlessly course one less bed available someone else risks *some* impact rest us, multiple beds constantly occupied people put ignorance impact likely felt. Obviously ideal would zero covid19 patients occupying ICU beds, risking health staff, taking time fewer better otherwise.  

The point things get catastrophic they've previously starts impact care hospitals able provide communities.  

Decreasing amount community spread makes life better everyone community. Even reflated impacts hospital system. kid's teacher gets sick covid whole classroom impacted, CEO dies covid entire company impacted, local small business owner close store limit capacity covid local economy impacted. Every person sickened virus *some* impact spreads beyond person effect magnified number people infected.  

There benefit increasing amount community spread virus plenty advantages working toward reducing advantages benefit vaccinated unvaccinated alike. Speaking father three daughters young vaccinate, one high risk complications, really feel low can't reasonably contract it, vaccine. think hesitant anti vacc crew stop first ever happening. Plus contract trace last few, even gets re-introduced cause outbreak since R0 1. 

(In theory, found way anti-vax group could spread local scale) hope so, too. Cause damn nasty reaction. Super glad got it, tho. mean, yeah lol. That's point vaccine. would relaxed literally getting vaccinated? First, concerned death. I‚Äôm concerned long term effects, need studied adults barely studied children. 

Second, think big difference advocating societal shift attitudes towards disease prevention (something think would good though) saying restrictions currently place stay place either community spread ends control Covid contact tracing children vaccinated. I‚Äôm asking people anything differently. I‚Äôm asking continue little bit longer instead dropping mild inconvenience masking adults able vaccinated. spread low area, makes sense. stupid. certainly hope trade-off children‚Äôs futures worth grandparents‚Äô final years.

Teachers pretty divided whether reopening schools good idea‚Äîthe teachers‚Äô unions different story. anything, schools should‚Äôve hybrid family could‚Äôve made choice themselves. also every often there's report submitted FAA crew noticed weird interference also looked like someone using phone they're always like ""we can't completely rule out, especially phone malfunctioning"" 


But even things like giving safety briefing, statistically speaking extremely unlikely save anyone injury given rare air accidents are.  That's heard. immunity system seems capable expected fight various strains based one. Unless get radicaly diffrent variant maybe 4th wave wiil minimal. months though, India perfect petri dish. see. Opening borders federal issue. I‚Äôm lovin‚Äô it. point people get first shot come back second shot. US mostly giving second shots seeing demand crater first shots. despite 46% population 1 shot supply issues. mask go store, asshole respect stores accountable tracking vaccinated not. Likewise, someone's home request it, thats fine. Otherwise really feel need it. feel like thats sensible take. vaccine called shot (or vaccine). Using needle insert substance someone's body called ""getting shot."" vaccine passes tests medical ethics, forced anyone. Sure, looks promising now, without big enough sample size time elapsed, unethical claim medical safety. still emergency use phase issued government, recommended every individual doctors. vaccine ever recommended 100% population come inherent risks may beneficial individual multitude reasons. mention, CDC isn‚Äôt government can‚Äôt make law. 

Seek understanding, listen people reasons, care others. Don‚Äôt throw single person bus don‚Äôt understand they‚Äôre coming from.

It‚Äôs gonna Starbucks red cups debacle Fox News thing is, Canadian healthcare honestly better.

We multiple years long waitlists family doctors.

We months even years long waitlists MRIs.

We months years long waitlists ‚Äúelective‚Äù surgeries leave people pain months even years end.

Tons Canadians every single year flock US pay tens thousands dollars pocket they‚Äôre desperate medical treatment can‚Äôt get country.

We caps many doctors government take, even shortages, meaning many doctors go US higher pay job opportunities.

We cancer patients going US told would‚Äôve dead stayed Canada, cancer fast progressing wait waitlists fulfilled.

You complain want American healthcare, system broken. keep seeing people complain system, many Canadians would agree would *much* rather American system. I‚Äôve seen conversation many times r/Canada real life.

Our system broken. sorts places partly I'm rather boring mostly they're still closed (by law) am. would awesome. Thanks! fun we're effectively run sort 'smuggle real information propaganda-controlled foreign nation' playbook citizens, they've literally trapped reality bubble penetrated McDonald's coffee cup. last states went general availability April 19, three weeks ago. CDC overly conservative everything‚Äîhell, CDC states women never drink alcohol unless they‚Äôre birth control. There‚Äôs reason CDC doesn‚Äôt make law. matter many countries stopped using use 60+, im gonna catch covid rate getting vaccinated.... matter time oppressed silenced, im sick tired crap, human beings Europe made mistakes clearly fault even tho clearly fault, voice ignored. US became demand-constrained roughly 3-4 weeks ago. There's quite bit time. writeup explain they're issue, DM youd like group people thought car accidents myth insisted walking blindfolded interstate, stop driving. vaccine available them, yeah lives matter chance vaccinated, get infected that's problem, hands, they're responsibility. Coffee McDonald's rubbish ! boiled water coffee taste use bluetooth, AFAIK, see RFID tags using phone induction charging coil. also get generic scanner. Yep. there's still huge pockets U.S. population coming receive vaccines (either 1st 2nd dose), main reason started exporting yet. 

That's logistics (aka ""last mile"") - nothing US' ability export. Plus states distributing, thus various schemes programs overcome hesitancy.

The two literally mutually exclusive. Masks saved many lives year. Covid kinds infectious diseases. Flu basically exist season. Seeing someone mask make us feel safe less. might good idea still wear Covid certain places. Yeah, I‚Äôm 15  media reading? McJavaJab. Much faster?

I mean airplane flight away - ~7 hours transatlantic vs ~1 hour US. net savings &lt; 10 hours. Follow road couple tweaks show something different? Fuck votes. Many lives saved getting shot. I've read mrna vaccines also associated VITT fuss?  keep saying US' economic gain.

Look trade Canada + Mexico vs country EU.

Again - global benefit *to US*. Nah that's bullshit approach. enjoy food eat responsibly staying active fit, dozens millions people. paying premium food others eating healthy amounts it. Cue ""cramming agenda throats"" people  Wishing best you, bright side optimistic recover extremely unlikely get fully vaccinated due antibodies. long republicans boycott McDonald's? survive without hamburger?  'member whole point reopening tu allow hospitals overwhelmed?

Oooooh 'member. I'm top half income US, wrong. Doubly live near city high cost living. Also rarely insurance cover everything regardless much pay. also reject claims cases ridiculous reasons, though gotten better.

A majority people America one dental emergency, car wreck, fall away big time debt it‚Äôll still weeks getting shots even couple weeks ago actually fully vaccinated.

Then take personal responsibility wait weeks things? 

Or things understand that, again, they're *responsible* get sick.

But them, hold rest us hostage. Switzerland.

32 year old, first dose done today, 2nd one start June. 

Hell fucking yeah. parents much likely die car crash giving Covid fully vaccinated. god damn anyone tried attaching magnets arms? need know thing.  I‚Äôm guy, likely (almost certainly) would fine, whatever read said. you‚Äôre also almost certainly going get anything definitive months best. powers decide boosters recommended fall/winter, that‚Äôs think expect see actual guidance mixing matching.

Again, I‚Äôm expert all, I‚Äôm avid reader things vaccine there‚Äôs reason I‚Äôm aware think would cause harm it‚Äôs even possible could result broader protection. posters said, well protected got point would best leave now, unless doctor advise otherwise.

Edit: saw post UK posting something AZ mRNA June so, exactly topic hand, interesting nonetheless. ‚ÄòI chose save lives‚Äô: Gov. Brown defends lockdown

Why choosing save even more, then? Take speed limit 15. Make people wear helmets exercising. not? hasn‚Äôt good study examining exactly issue far know, circumstantial evidence suggests vaccinated people transmit, would happen drastically reduced rate compared unvaccinated people. Reasons: huge reductions infection (85~95%), vaccinated infected usually lower viral loads clear virus quickly (so less contagious fewer days), solid mucosal antibodies, documented cases breakthrough infection transmitting someone else. Israel test bed vaccines, carefully tracked people got virus, recovered, got vaccinated, etc. real world data available millions people.

But somehow CDC can't look data use instead must plod along glacial pace, exaggerating every possible risk. make recommendation ""6 feet"" thing, turns scientific basis someone pulled number air.

Then head CDC says feeling ""impending doom"". scientific comment?

It sad source information leadership, bunch people panicked way depth trying manage crisis. spread among unvaccinated

That's them. Getting second Moderna shot Thursday! thank you. duped first time. mean, bars open food. food thing done 29th. agree August 1st 100% capacity frustrating let's lie it. like idea positive reinforcement, we've bomb threat two mass vaccination sites Germany based idea first, shy approach legislation offering less restrictions \[no testing getting hair done\] people vaccinated recovered. Sometimes wonder, what's going minds?

Yet, vaccines getting people soon they're delivered, much worry right - could ramble government screwing ordering process \[hey, end day - vaccine producers need ""we need X doses product DATE negotiations mutually agreed PRICE"" instead ""we need stuff, soon deliver, cheapest price possible""\] people feel like getting vaccinated yet. said done, we're currently boring stretch: enough people vaccinated real change protective measures, enough vaccine doses vaccinate everybody wants vaccinated... long run, matter we'll probably continue see cases melt. November, it'll moot point. certain potential annoying next 8-12 weeks. Go live life. parents safe  US started easing export restriction India April 26th. solid ban anymore means.

The US also release 60 million doses ""as become available"" indicating doses actually still manufacturing process. Shipments gone out, however, Mexico Canada. says they‚Äôre responsible majority doses produced? like Canada place would hire me. amount defensiveness, deflection, whataboutism Canadians worthy gold metal mental gymnastics Tokyo.

Right, still seem content enough keep it. again, power choice deciding Canada best solution you. seems like wouldn‚Äôt happy anywhere options open unless felt best was, said, ‚Äòworst worlds‚Äô. I‚Äôve seeing ads YouTube days Seek vulnerable? chance minimal functionally zero. know area area people getting shot I've officially stopped worrying it. Anyone unvaccinated point chosen risk. Good idea. convince fill cups coffee anyone buy... true cases drop little bit May last year, far differences now. one country whole far open last spring, yet cases continue trend pretty fast clip that. Hospitals deaths also trending cases trending down, drop even coming weeks. We‚Äôre also testing way last year, positivity rate 5% whole country. Vaccines clearly working reducing spread health care stress, don‚Äôt think case change seasons. Ireland Wearing mask restricting life. things open things open go things. one telling stay home vaccinated least I'm not. Saying ""hey movie theater wear mask"" ""While bar drinking wear mask"" ""while gambling wear mask"" restricting. go fun live life. Go see friends. mall, public indoors, wear mask big deal. Plus, going see people get vaccinated.

I agree say today. said anyone could walk drug store get vaccine wait.

""anyone"" includes people 16. probably safer going 30 minute drive boomers pretty high vaccination rate, they? think 50 white men worst right now. Boomers remember polio know they're higher risk covid age. Can't wait see fat-fuck antivaxxers threaten eat McDonald's ever lol 5G rockin' right now.    Yeah similar thing those. 

Science says increased risk lung cancer smoke. 

But whether person allowed something bad health political decision. ""Science"" can't give answer question. Tax fast food &amp; unhealthy food like alcohol cigarettes. put extra tax money toward benefiting healthy options make cheaper consumer. put extra tax money toward obesity related health problems  McDonald's talked government buying coffee cups them.... fixed it. Brazilian here. Vaccines, exams sorts treatments free, medicine not. government created program called Farm√°cia Popular (Popular Drugstore) mandates companies break drug patents companies sell drugs affordable prices Risk low. Dumb decision. #firstworldproblems worth trying reason Americans. fat king table full food villagers outside starve death yet keep demanding food table may feast much wants first. concept concern others exist.  laboratories struggling keep punishing Covid-19 surge, scientists try track understand new coronavirus Monday, World Health Organization classified variant first identified India, known B.1.617, ‚Äúvariant concern,‚Äù saying preliminary studies suggested may contagious variants. WHO‚Äôs scientists didn‚Äôt report evidence vaccines aren‚Äôt effective new process ramping capacity genomic sequencing track changes virus‚Äôs genetic makeup examining positive test samples. Yet effort India, dealing world‚Äôs worst current Covid-19 outbreak, fraction scale genomic sequencing done U.K. extremely reduced rate. Wow, world safe!! fast food companies, accept sick leaves pandemic that. Maybe awake sympathy consumers. 3.2.1 conservative trigger might testing people symptoms. that's case see result would consistent trials (and mean positive sense - would way better!). obvious enough saying shit? joke ""rna bad, changes us blablabla level"" ""this new vaccine needs 20 years RCT use it"". Yes. This. Everybody else getting wrong thread lol . I‚Äôd concerned approval timelines make happen fall honest. Otherwise, like vaccine requirements students attend school. require vaccines attend - this? Mini-clones yourself?? No, don't.  anyone office feel sympathy her? I've seen research says people regain taste smell getting vaccinated. hope that's case lost due terrible virus. I'm 5 days 2nd shot kinda dreading idea going again. I'm introverted (or maybe now?), feels weird uncomfortable. can't wait go back gym though, main motivation get vaxxed. worked retail 14 years hell without pandemic. can't imagine people dealing past year. sane people stayed home, I'm sure deal lot low brow crowd.  I'm sorry dealing people dicks towards you. perfectly reasonable anxious covid, joke. whatever need feel comfortable others judge you, them. Ya agree. Dude missed point entirely. data suggests vaccinated people may even able carry virus. vaccines strong, makes happy. I‚Äôm NJ got 2nd shot yesterday. still feeling lot trauma ptsd this. Especially mom three struggling take kids even park don‚Äôt go stir crazy house. playgrounds crawling mask less kids blue lives matter parents huddled maskless groups. 

And aware demographic hardest hit, witnessing careless selfish groups white people gathering like nothing. upsets much. local friend mine lives multigenerational home, Hispanic, lost three members family two weeks. month pandemic last year.
But loss isn‚Äôt hitting white families hard, continue gather maskless ignoring science discussion say otherwise.

I tears getting vaccine yesterday, overwhelmed gratitude thanked nurse saving everyone else there. kids noticeably relaxed came home shot, grateful I‚Äôm protected safe now.

But vax available kids, still don‚Äôt freedom go back normal. don‚Äôt feel safe taking inside movie theater restaurant they‚Äôve vaccinated. that‚Äôs due understanding lasting effects covid knowing don‚Äôt wanna risk kids health popcorn theater. That's key, die. hope fully recovered already. Hospitalizations may up, deaths barely budged low point pandemic. wonder hospitals lowering criteria admitted they're less worried huge waves? ‚Äúpromote‚Äù liveable wages? 70% first vaccine? Isn‚Äôt 6 weeks early? get vaccinated. Yeah agree things quickly changing, suggested maybe 1-2 months mask wearing. Damn sounds like Fauci agrees too. Maybe policy power? educate anyone global warming? threatens life earth, anti vaxxers. Whitmer thing Michigan. never reach 70%. rate people vaccinated city Detroit 22%. ton supply little demand. People city want get vaccinated. Honestly, higher risk alcohol poisoning, depending kind party is. Go party, fine. terrible day saw someone 3 comment karma say great day ate salty fatty fried things decided keep eating garbage makes die young. willing lock down/abide restrictions safety children? really don‚Äôt understand attitude seems common here. Foreal though, Gidget bae growing up. going information cup, words ""We This"". J&amp;J vaccination. mentioned article, others. virus can‚Äôt break vaccine. may picked worst example make point. 

Seatbelts save inordinate number lives. wanted eliminate auto deaths, would make sure cars can‚Äôt go 30 mph, mandate Tesla-like auto brakes absurd levels, require everyone wear helmet get car. don‚Äôt that. 

There zero risk catching covid getting sniffles you‚Äôre outside vaccinated. taking ‚Äúbetter safe sorry‚Äù effectively thing sorry. bother, check guy's comments regarding U.S. exports. like wants Biden rush things without developing proper plan distribute vaccines nations different needs. Cheers guess lol


Tbh think putting ""go get ur shot"" McDonald's cup scare more. ""Now corporations (that loved last week) it""

I think may freak say wondering never problems way deaths.  correlate vaccination rates education funding!! also takes people die diagnosed hospitalized, current deaths tied cases hospitalizations weeks ago. state‚Äôs medicare covers lot countries adequate supply coming months vaccinate entire populations much faster Americans would expect. people willing endless debates every state approach hold things up. asian countries especially efficient things. People making fun Japan really start vaccinate done quickly. important people get vaccinated. current vaccines least give resistance variants boosters become available. post-vaccine infections US, too. news nobody ever claimed vaccines 100% effective. vaccines good enough is. need sort mathematical sleight-of-hand hurt credibility them. Really hoping Riot Fest Chicago happens Huh, state‚Äôs medicare better Statistics say completely fine. It‚Äôs sacrificing let live life; it‚Äôs much less harmful flu them. They'll stop enforcing much. still wear indoors Israel, usage declined significantly.  talking about? EU export ban, indicated Japan Australia (the former get first AZ vaccine America it). agree. Consider also number cases peak December January. time would people hospitalized, virtually one vaccinated. 

This kind misleading pro vaccine spin adds mistrust anything media says it. I'm willing sacrifice generation, thanks! pass often can. Fair points totally agree last couple sentences. *spins wheel* MUH EUA!!!  figure? Usage probably decline socially anyway.

Well, no, that's problem. there's indoor mandate, followed. Localities send people make sure businesses enforcing it. say riskier, seem like people. Privileged definetly. They've handled pandemic brilliantly sort victims success.

Look many people gotten US. Australians would get it, they're rush. That's specifically describe introverted anti-social. Canadians, employers provide extras well, many people get coverage way. huge support however fill gaps, pharmacare likely first rolled in. live area Covid never taken seriously majority, local authorities officials reinforced message decreasing masks physical distancing considered strictly voluntary public spaces business owners could choose preventative measures take/enforce property, simply choose opt completely go business usual. message high risk people ""if scared, stay home"". did, got vaccinated. went around public receive necessary in-person medical care. Now? I'm scared anymore living normal life again. Given medical issues terribly exciting life, I'm still back personal normal again. people vaccinated vaccinated. would absolutely shocked eventually reach 50% county. expectation seems we'll end 40% here. Like morons would ever give precious Mickey D's. concur wish we'd move faster supply vaccines clearly use. Singapore controlled situation pretty well recently reported number breakthrough cases involving B16172 variant too. Good news vaccination (Pfizer Moderna used Singapore) helped prevent severe disease. recent 14.9% case increase ‚â† 15% incident indication, think we've seen population really starting wear thin measures. think 70% great target hopefully motivate others get game here. We'd need another 23% Oregonians get shots get there, hopefully it. I've fully vaccinated 3 weeks, wife 2.
Our kids - 12 &amp; 15 - course yet, soon. 

Still, still wear masks understand could carry who, whatever reason, might vaccinated yet.


But come time reasonable expectations expire stupid refuse vaccinate, let Darwinism treasure course. 

For CANNOT vaccinate, actual medical reasons... I'm sorry. Brilliant. Messaging matters. comment top comment. There's point telling people explicitly stop wearing since cost significant disadvantage. Usage probably decline socially anyway.  Good McDonalds agree man. Pro mask, pro vax pro-lockdown here. say confidence things preventing infection, also reducing transmission illness get infected, get change behaviors (under normal circumstances, people obviously reasons cautious, immunosuppression) 

It's liberating go visit grandma, friends, see movie, eat inside. I'm even much keeping busy type shit year. want now. Try telling people binge watch Tucker Carlson. 99% outside 95% credible interval data set. 100% probably is, though. Well ""riskier"". irresponsible privileged get it. Canada pace reach 75% adults one+ dose 81 days US. Yes, heard right. Mutator? Get vaccinated.   got mine 4 pm didn‚Äôt really start running fever 11 next day. moderna fwiw. happen. Hospitals ICUs typical Tuesday bump

Also deaths lagging indicator. deaths today could month ago Meanwhile, anti-vax coworker pissed asked get negative test prior coming office attending 3 day music festival. YES!! many people conflate introverted antisocial. I‚Äôm introverted LOVE social close friends. need time recharge alone it. 

Needless say, I‚Äôm happy clam friends starting reach fully vaccinated status. case Australia, really. There's community spread, people getting vaccine seems riskier. really hope University System Georgia follows trend, don‚Äôt high hopes. 80% infections non-vaccinated people Got second dose Pfizer 9am today. currently 6pm. symptoms besides sore arm. woods hit later tonight? zero-nuance zone something?

Widespread COVID-19 infection causes large amount deaths *and* immunity. exactly said implied, though believe referring clear. point, reasonable people don‚Äôt typically post share completely bogus articles/videos. smallest microchip made 2 nanometers thick. device powerful enough run A.I cryptography several hundred thousand transistors [fits grain 2,000,000 nanometers width. 
A syringe hole 200,000 nanometers wide. 
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs anywhere near inconceivable say could make injectable microchip today‚Äôs science. 

That said, think you‚Äôd notice floating fluid. hope day lovely you, honey :) 38,000 population given shot Chinese state-owned firm Sinopharm April said Sinopharm 78% effective preventing symptomatic severe disease adults 60, little data success older United Arab Emirates, used tens thousands Sinopharm shots, asked received vaccine return third dose, citing low immune vaccines performed poorly developed Pfizer Moderna, use mRNA technology reported effectiveness rates around 95%.

Yeah, get shitty chinese need source know mcdonalds advertising literally living rock vaccine proven withstand variants. you‚Äôre vaccinated, you‚Äôre fine. Go live life. case would deaths previous Sunday either. based [daily someone dies death certificate date death it. clerk entered report sunday mean person's death reported occurring monday. Close true true. *All* breakthrough cases Israel studies individuals less 2 weeks past second dose, majority individuals barely past second dose yet received it. protection one dose pretty good, second dose elongate protection, increases protection. excuse? women whole, use excuse well? long term side effects vaccines also show right away.

The virus *WAY RISKIER VACCINE*.  We‚Äôve really vaccinating mass 6 months, we‚Äôve Covid bulk well year. yeah, 6th months there‚Äôs indication issues I‚Äôve read about, isn‚Äôt much time. yes, it‚Äôs good point know Covid nasty ‚Äòlong term‚Äô effects people ‚Äî I‚Äôd argue even won‚Äôt understand full ramifications time. you‚Äôre thinking it‚Äôs easy calculate risk equation incorrectly. I‚Äôd also note people inherent tendency treat ‚Äúdon‚Äôt actively intervene approach‚Äù ‚Äúless risky‚Äù - even it‚Äôs demonstrably false. compare statistics virus vaccine then? shitload people gotten vaccine virus. virus killed millions, vaccine killed handful. KNOW virus long term effects. *THINK* vaccine *COULD* long term effects. Pick one lowest chance harm - that‚Äôs vaccine - overwhelming margin. He‚Äôs Canadian, can‚Äôt fixed zip ties Robertson screwdriver thrilled. accept like Timmy‚Äôs coffee isn‚Äôt double-double fries without poutine, won‚Äôt celebrate. one pretty sticky, unfortunately. Totally vouch that. Living 26 years growing body evidence suggests fully vaccinated people less likely asymptomatic infection potentially less likely transmit SARS-CoV-2 others. stroke driving car cause harm people. We've deemed risk low enough allow people drive cars anyway. 57 percent cases. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs main reason. think due horrible educational structures poorer urban areas look Vincent Racaniello AMA, sidebar.

My understanding none variants make difference. Remember variants going crush Michigan weeks ago? look numbers now. Go take look graph minute. wonderful article. many people vulnerable classes gotten vaccine, anti-science mumbo-jumbo, can't afford day off, let alone two second appointments getting sick side effects. There's also lot non-English speaking people insular communities effectively appealed advertised to. 

We better. COVID shots free good step, I'm largely praising USA's COVID shot rollout. said, there's reason upper classes take quickly, afford to. financially, also aware ways get it, ability travel demand convenient ways get shot, afford take days non-manual labor work side effects.

Ain't ""working home"" option people lathe kitchen. Argument cheap, where's evidence? many covid positive cases actually sequenced? 1/1000 ? that‚Äôs case easily conclude prevalence much higher what‚Äôs recorded gonna lie, never heard country many months, they've given 18% shots need give. understands, still see disappointment eyes proposes go somewhere say I'm comfortable it. sucks. want unhappy. That‚Äôs Massachusetts üí™üèº 5 states Top 5 (total vaccination rate) New England states parents like say ""I get flu shot either"" (still thinking similar). claim antivax, guess mom recently get tetanus shot. Welp vaccinated go fun. Definitely knew outdoor masking pointless. waiting announcement dropping because, said, it‚Äôs pointless. educators Texas I‚Äôve spoken supported person learning it‚Äôs worth Useless. Someone wrote headline wrote article. Well certainly hope is. **That's whole point vaccinated!!** going actually enjoy theater rather something actually necessary. hope stop spreading BS masks restricting people's lives. lot parents don‚Äôt want vaccinate kids don‚Äôt see necessary think ‚Äúbut *could* mutate escape variant‚Äù stop taken seriously reason keep restrictions place vaccinated people? It‚Äôs getting tiresome. concern kids potential long term effects COVID versus potential long term effects vaccine. agree adults would get vaccinated would preferable. won't.  Well California worse almost schools open totally locked down. don‚Äôt think hold one person accountable. end result similar. Wonder explained. lived California first half surge Texas second half cases fell soon Texas.  Hard understand. non-vaccinated person, I'm cool that. came terms vulnerable COVID last spring, rather cowering fear basement year. infected worse kids getting vaccine. kids show issue covid.

Yes is. People ages died Covid-19. MIS-C really freaking scary.

We know long term effects uncontrolled infection children. Massive underreporting. difference you‚Äôre using far superior vaccine Oh god, oh god looked. dumber. still vulnerable population really much smaller was. Florida estimated million, difficult get seniors.

I know dad, bedridden home Florida, able get vaccine Monday. Someone bring shot. Yea... experts news acknowledging everyone knew months -- outdoor masking close pointless. ‚ÄúI immune system‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Vaccinations use immune system build response disease.

They‚Äôre acting like vaccinated people don‚Äôt use immune system: vaccinated people do, train hand.

It‚Äôs like hitting gym practicing start basketball/baseball/football/what-have-you season numbers average

Despite benefit largely spared first wave, included disproportionate amount deaths. would get downvoted? surprised community subjected Tuskegee Study would hesitant get vaccine? stopped here...Details: study also looked 47,000 Cleveland Clinic employees received one shot, shots shots all. vaccines get kids carry less risk new ones COVID. going make claim like that, need back up. can‚Äôt prove negative something made thin air. Skeptical vaccines due history fucked with, medically, population. Important historical context  Nothing wrong immune system. manly. risk vs reward. sick long time. Like can't remember last time must 6 7 years ago. Covid reach doubt effect. flip side know absolutely nothing vaccines. Neither anyone else. tested properly I'm rush put danger. want protect possibly carrier go ahead get it. That's choice, much choice get it. enjoy staying home I'll going out. refuse test yourself. negative test also permit vaccination. I‚Äôm month second shot feeling finally like *do things* stress anymore. 

I cautious diligent year almost forget put mask sometimes. It‚Äôs wonderful let go stress go life complying masking distance comfort others rather sense safety That's fantastic news. Unless Janssen completely fails deliver June (eg. delivers nothing all) able adults partially vaccinated June. Quite remarkable increase vaccination speed. worried Netherlands started vaccinating 2 weeks every EU country, seem average level. counter-argument ? disagree without discussion. don‚Äôt require Flu vaccines school despite way deadly kids kids spread flu easier covid know, make claim. added info backing claim that, BioNTech zero experience producing vaccines massive scale, they're miles ahead AZ.

Pfizer one plant BioNTech (4 vs 3) likely Pfizer produces (that's contracted BioNTech first place). Mine still case vaccination counters, articles Covid idea you‚Äôre talking about. vaccines risks. I'm complaining. adding discussion. want think harm sugar getting diabetes. Definitely going there. 

Covid serious. can't compare them. One virus, another decades lying consumers causing mass obesity extending obese children. least US is. 

I'm sure one help other. shit? Since majority population still isnt even fully vaccinated(35%?). percentage january would almost zero(1%?). weird article. children better vaccinated not, like case. Relax. immune system designed millions years tackle illness thrown millions years ago. stuff that's specific modern times. Virus without doubt Nah, one CanSino, pretty obvious name reports Brazil babies children getting unusually sick dying sensationalism? hospitalization/death incidence rates Brazil P.1 vs US P.1.

In words, GIVEN young child infected P.1:
- likely get sick die, relative base rates SARS-Cov2?
- observable difference?

It‚Äôs tough tease Brazil reports due lack vaccination plus lack distancing, instead something inherently unique P.1 children. Ya know say stuff made china theory maybe Far right Hindu nationalists india downvote every post critical india prime minister. thought article onion. Like... WOULD THOUGHT PEOPLE GETTING HOSPITALIZED COVID VACCINATED!?

I'm sure there's still lot confused maybe intelligent people susceptible believing things like lizard people, unicorns electronic devices bringing plagues... yeah maybe... need spell like report news... **PLZZZZ** news article headings us normal people think we're looking article Onion/Beaverton? I‚Äôll try then, man arguing people ridiculous‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ enough wood burn dead really stark reminder damage covid REALLY do. Many us sheltered it, like think world better pandemics used be, covid relatively weak one. world spent last year trying hold back. organization WHO's sole job help prevent sorts things.... 45 year old male riskier long term, virus vaccine? ""Not morons lucky you."" fine explanation. neighbor told me, decided get vaccine because,even it, people getting sick... Better eat healthy boost immune system. Im Looking forward Friday age group finally register vaccine.  Conservatives argued while. they‚Äôll tell they‚Äôve never received vaccine anything entire life. What‚Äôs argument that?

""You're lying."" Reporting agencies do. EU never prevented doses exported Japan. Japan made decision get US due concerns.

The *only* time vaccines prevented exported 250,000 order Australia. anti-vaxx people vaccinated, children vaccinate. Politicians making ""authoritarian"" ultimatums covid-19 authoritavely killed 582,000 people. comparison, 2019, 38k people died automobile accidents.

You want graphics explaining crazy Covid-19 is? Here's graph Wikipedia showing preventable death categories year 2000 people younger deaths infectious diseases 100k. infectious diseases. Covid-19 killed 5x amount despite mask mandates, social distancing orders, business restrictions.

A politician telling follow medical guidance good general welfare authoritarian. supposed right biochemical weapon.

If think ""some politicians done bad job handling pandemic"", think people could agree that. calling public health order ""authoritarian"" much merit taking medicine prescribed doctor. long insurance companies start saying : choose get vaccine, choose cover Covid hospital expenses ? healthcare costs way US, would way get people take shots. disagreement.

Those crying people lack skill initiative get one etc. basically ignorant constraints lives people different live. Ehhh idk. Maybe? like known bad seems like already escaped area in. I'm really sure people could've prevented it. got Johnson Johnson shot last Tuesday. Friday developed sore throat cough.

Governments must always held account decisions cannot allow load duties private ventures. cost ‚Ç¨385, break bank much. Point taken... I'm glad New Zealand managed well said different countries different cultures even every country thing New Zealand dont think would work everywhere different countries people would react differently Hogan MD? don‚Äôt see reason fully vaccinated people can‚Äôt return normal life.

Me either. get numbers from? risk continued spread contributes rise new variants may render vaccines ineffective. Also, immune compromised people don‚Äôt get protection healthy individual gets vaccine. still risk won‚Äôt get vaccine. need details somebody smarter needs unravel me.

Based article, know whether actual can't tell whether Sinovac highly effective not. article states Indonesia tracked 128K healthcare workers vaccine ""protected"" 98% death 96% hospitalization. **Without control group**, know effective was. Perhaps PPE workers wearing gave protection? age group healthcare workers Indonesia heavily biased toward younger groups?

If among 128K healthcare workers, subset (let's say 64K) vaccinated 640 got hospitalized Covid subset vaccinated 32 hospitalized, generally infer Sinovac highly effective (95+%) article implying based information furnished article, **highly effective** seems questionable me. 

But maybe study track healthcare workers based vaccination status claim based real life observational differences. need info. Yes. risk sounding arrogant, knew smarter people (due succeeding technically difficult field), guess think extreme end distribution...

I think aggravating many make attempt educate whether perfectly reasonable first-blush concern actually really concern. public health crisis like this, either take time understand going enough depth make good decision, go experts saying. say 'It's fast' never think again. concern, took time educate vaccine process, done here, looked things like big trials previously approved vaccines are, etc.

The thing bothers rate unknown potential long-term concerns, certainly non-zero risks, based mRNA works (it stick around) massive number similar proteins spike protein introduced bodies daily viruses (like colds, etc), risk really really small. compare risk eating healthy environmental exposures toxins chemicals, etc ridiculous. actually actively living life avoid risks maybe good argument, given public health crisis ridiculous use minute potential risk excuse taking many orders magnitude higher risks every day life.

I think help people avoided getting covid far (due measures like lockdowns masks put place) therefore rate risk getting disease low minds, fact risk disease much higher vaccination risks, comparatively. Precovid extremely social long hauling 4 plus mos knowing could ever bike ride swim something you. I‚Äôm scared variants makes vaccines less effective. see goes I‚Äôm overly cautious protection half US doesn‚Äôt give shit. don‚Äôt want shit many people subreddits posted second time around worse.

I think that's caught guard down. one wants another ""that can't happen here"" situation. *surprised pikachu face* Oh think now? yeah let's racist keep borders open. incorrect. anything, newer mRNA vaccines safer old ones kinda feel like everything floridas politicians say days sensible people exact opposite. like hear florida man meme went *""I florida man this!""* need validation others around me. however push back bad ideas.

Can't call Indian variant, ok call UK variant South African Yeah heard lot South American countries strict lockdowns paper aren‚Äôt enforced all. find campaign pretty frustrating tbh. early 30s age range still says end June, months.

Metro Denver counties lift remaining COVID-19 restrictions move Level Clear weekend 
Restaurants, offices, retail able operate 100% capacity additional requirements 
Jessica Seaman May 12, 2021 6:00 a.m.

Much metro Denver see remaining county-level COVID-19 public health restrictions lifted weekend, although people still required wear masks specific indoor settings statewide order remains place least next month. 
Jefferson, Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder Broomfield counties confirmed Tuesday move Level Blue new phase called Level Clear Sunday. 
Denver‚Äôs public health agency stopped short committing move Level Clear, said city anticipates ‚Äúaligning‚Äù neighboring counties. 
Once metro counties move Level Clear, restaurants, bars, offices indoor settings operate 100% capacity additional requirements, according Tri-County Health Department‚Äôs public health order. 
At Level Blue, restaurants gyms offer full capacity 6 feet social distancing possible, bars operate 25% capacity, retail office spaces limited 75% capacity. 
The Denver Department Public Health Environment ‚Äúis working regional state partners evaluate potential restrictions expirations current public health order,‚Äù spokesperson Clarissa Boggs-Blake said email Tuesday. ‚ÄúWe anticipate aligning neighboring jurisdictions well adopting reference remaining state public health order requirements.‚Äù 
Colorado handed control COVID-19 public health measures local authorities last month expiration state‚Äôs color-coded restriction dial. Many counties opted impose local restrictions point, metro area chose remain Level Blue another month. 
Douglas County exception, opting plans Tri-County Health Department ‚Äî also serves Adams Arapahoe counties ‚Äî stay Level Blue Saturday. 
The counties moving Level Clear Sunday enter ‚Äúobservation period‚Äù 90 days. county experiences rise rate coronavirus hospital admissions, move stricter restrictions, according Tri-County Jefferson County health department orders. 
The state still requires masks schools, child care centers, indoor children‚Äôs camps, prisons health care settings. However, masks longer required indoor gatherings least 80% group inoculated coronavirus. 
Additionally, state health department mandates 6 feet distancing indoor events 100 people requires plans submitted outdoor, ticketed, seated events locations larger 30,000 square feet. state also requires review indoor events 500 people. 
‚ÄúThe state‚Äôs order expires May 15, expect updates state regarding restrictions plan continue end week,‚Äù said Gary Sky, spokesman Tri-County Health Department, said email. 60 million doses yet. There's around 10-15 million finished doses still pending FDA safety review One could hope, jfc hate wearing masks outside super hot. I'm fully vaccinated, let free! take worked fine refuse eat chicken nuggets buy grocery store lot less money instead.

2) misremembering someone talking credit scores impacting life insurance risk categories.   new variant concern detected prevented spreading outside local area originated, know learned prevent pandemic happening.

We idea would look like none place. hasn‚Äôt around long enough us even know long term effects. Didn‚Äôt vaccine come ? They're wrong  can't happen fast.

I 12 year old vaccinating fast possible next week. Unfortunately also 10 year old probably able vaccinated Oct Nov. No, vaccines focus reducing sick get. That's flu shot encouraged every year. prevent catching flu, reduce severity.

Let rephrase. illness kills much Spanish Flu did, even current technology, we're screwed. better? *shockedpikachu.jpg* seen black death, killed like third Europe's population. seen worse tragedies Spanish flu.

Btw, dependent state, understand many still mask distancing mandates. can't guess low cases go, I'm excited drop deaths beginning (lagged weeks cases started dropping again).

The answer long immunity lasts depends lot different factors. Age, health, strength immune response even diet.

I've probably gotten flu shot every year century, think require attend school. 1 month would incredible *had known know now*. Stick extra month news China's pneumonia cases spread countries almost nothing would change. taking seriously *done* preparation chance.  Sucks think Massachusetts well Boston fully open late August. get opening early giving everyone chance get vaccinated dates leadership putting opening way late. Like hurry get vaccinated nothing change.    weekend update year official toll 0 deaths. Obviously fully true, see downward trend deaths happy it. Obviously problem solved, scold people happy data point showing good news? People exhausted seeing horrible news year, get glimmer hope see comments people complaining. There's much Massachusetts do, one best country vaccinations like people vigilant safe. Give Contagion shitty Hollywood movie? thought fantastic horrifying. people help anger issues. guess hurt positive attitude. I'm professor though find dance around lot issues last years especially. I'm moderate still struggle. teach anything political either never know go off. But, maybe right like 20 years happens part... Seriously...you grasp craziness. kids total asymptomatic passing since obviously parents grandparents aren‚Äôt getting high case volumes... staff aren‚Äôt getting either bc cases way down...This reason alarm concern? Seriously? Keep trying? Phantom covid cases. Would pandemic one died got sick???? Stop think. pandemic bc world couldn‚Äôt keep treating people critically ill. don‚Äôt test kids colds winter. literally become ridiculous. schools Texas including district wearing masks end year. cases spreading like wild fire: report many cases school everyday. time go walmart? Free shots, appointments, walk ins welcome.

I mean come on.... No, takes leadership rises occasion.

The public magically become disciplined cooperate. Mid-2022 borders open says budget...that's going upset lot families relatives abroad I'm actually bit hard time believing high.

I certainly believe it. everyone sick going get tested end case add count. Lots people minor enough symptoms bother tested, families might bother testing everyone one person gets sick tests positive since quarantine anyway. Add asymptomatic infections shown around 20% covid infections. lot cases probably missing count.

Having said that, vast majority criticism leveled since beginning pandemic, they're corrupted China, intentionally negligently downplayed risks involved, simply wrong. misinformation certainly spread partisan political actors, national political parties vested interest mitigating criticism response nationalists fundamentally opposed international organizations. need partisan nationalist buy misinformation. 

One significant factors WHO's inability act quickly definitively lack actual authority. many people think basically global version national public health authority power state. simply that. ever be? Probably not. get closer power additional funding authority granted member states.

Arguments mixed subject. *most* educated positions I've read seem indicate they're roughly similar.

About 1/3 world's population infected Spanish Flu, resulted massive death toll, like 50 million.

COVID infected far far lower fraction global population (so far). Updated metrics hospitalization indicate like 3% infected people get hospitalized. mentally play 1918 medical technology, I'd write people dead. imagine Spanish Flu infection rate (1/3 population), multiply 0.03, get like 70 million people modern population. That's kind like would COVID-19 modern media tell us work home modern medicine treat it. However, world population 5-6 times larger 1918. suggests COVID-19 actually less deadly factor around maybe 4.

Obio 100% correct here. We're considerably order magnitude. think hard part.

This criminal. I'm sorry go this. **zero** justification policy like this. (the US Western world) could ""eliminate""(using article's definition) it.

It's like flu loads strains use archaic process make vaccines.

We've got straight art, highly effective vaccines shown highly effective concerning variants.

I'm sorry, that's complete fantasy. 196 countries earth 7 billion people. Nobody's going say ""on December 23, 2022 every living person fully vaxxed safe!"". fuck's sake, even Biden governors saying herd immunity needed lifting restrictions fact lot publications saying herd immunity US alone never achieved. Virus mutations natural. Why? im American live America 

Also every country says best way another everyone says best dont mean true 

It seems like part American culture patriotic 

Also reddit biggest user base America hear America mistakes countries assure least England messed ways 1 lot people hear  perception reading headline amount increase acceptable related person learning without question cost remote learning.

Vulnerable communities suffered most. kids school year. Jobs businesses lost. California win battle. great news seeing real world effectiveness previous western studies incorrectly showed werent effective.  Yes pandemic great time cut hospital budgets. country, next pandemic hit hard worse Republicans made anti-mask, anti-vax, anti-lockdown entire personality. selfishness right knows bounds. experts actually said prioritize ""masks"", particularly respirators, HCWs vulnerable populations.

But whole pandemic depressing case study ""A person smart, people dumb"": slightly complicated messaging twisted turned around kinds ways. mean, statistically that's incorrect. spanish flu killed 20-50 million worldwide -- world bit 2 billion people.

So, somewhere 1:100 1:40 people died spanish flu 1918.

Covid killed 3.3 million, population earth \~4x 1918 (\~7.8 billion). world also WAY interconnected today back 1918 -- much much easier viral pandemic occur.

Around 1:2360 world population died covid-19.

Yes, we're done deaths -- ratio get worse -- we're still considerably order magnitude spanish flu.

If hypothetically swap spanish flu covid-19 -- given young seem mostly come unscathed -- modern problems like obesity directly correlated negative outcomes (considerably less obesity 1918) -- serious doubts would deadly spanish flu.

It might mutated rapidly -- that's getting stupidly hypothetical point way even really entertaining it. recommended public adopt masking ensure supply health care providers.

What saying here? lie masks ineffective? lie justified?

Your wording ambiguous. reading comprehension issues. Please clarify. stated January 2020, ""There clear evidence COVID-19 transmissible sure, let's give power, next time prevent this. time virus arrived America already spread across world ravaged Italy, Spain, Iran, China.

These people still buy groceries meet family. see. Thanks explaining.  China. Blame China. Jesus‚Ä¶  people gotten banned sub, called ""anti mask"" laughing people insist wearing masks reason. little bit silly point, reddit definitely culture war website. Apparently new conspiracy vaccinated people shed something make unvaccinated people sterile. unvaccinated anti-maskers thinking masking protect vaccinated.

It would ironic yet appropriate anti-maskers get covid become unable breed best efforts ignoring actual science. Ya would still take time experiments. can't say covid causing could many factors involved it. kinds different folk there. helpful cast judgment since case goal get many vax'ed quickly possible. requires leadership understand create opportunities, described article. mandatory everyone. 

And not, get rid parental consent. would easier believe posted research correlation hormonal growth direct affect vaccines, especially mRNA. otherwise playing guessing game saying ""well, could bad I'm scientist!"" Cool, credentials make sort ""facts.""  Good points. also geographic practical realities make unrealistic copy-and-paste NZ's approach every country. far know, simply fuck around quarantining, case discovered whole street would isolate while, pain personal level, end day saves 90% country lockdown. even willing take vaccine, responsibility go theater keep safer choices. together us all. requirement vaccination Japan repeatedly said won‚Äôt required. people get two dose vaccination two weeks after, Pfizer, need start immediately. don‚Äôt list unvaccinated countries athletes. saw Brazil vaccinating people sending. today, many countries haven‚Äôt prioritized Olympic athletes vaccination.

Japan‚Äôs virus distribution age. aren‚Äôt prioritizing Olympics way , though maybe vaccinate athletes. 

The need local staff run games posted times. going providing transportation, giving directions, preparing food, cleaning, etc., etc. last article said need 75,000 volunteers though maybe decreases fans stands. anyone remembers, lot bullshit how, ""we need save face masks healthcare workers"" time, healthcare workers told, ""masks dont really work get saturated quickly effectiveness goes people touch mask much"".

The problem early last year mostly communication, one still going day people talk ""masks"" without making differentiation actually talking about.

A surgical mask mask, really filter anything except largest particulates, respirator like N95/FFP2 offers much better protection wearer. Early last year massive shortage particularly respirators like N95/FFP2, even tho medical personal really needed stuff keep healthy taking care infected. 

That's much mixed messaging ""[You need vs ""[HCW struggling get proper  fact got pretty telling.

If multiply probability two events together would low probability.

Makes wonder two events share something common caused get pretty sick. statistics terms maybe fully independent events. Possibly got large viral load initial exposure.

Btw, concern real world studies. happening situations still lot social distancing. results going going sporting events yelling top lungs? Could find situations, higher viral load drunk guy yelling behind current effectiveness stats going hold? No...you're looking total deaths since beginning. numbers current daily death rates. get numbers take latest 7-day average daily death rate divide population millions. Example California 48/day death rate divided 40M = 1.2/M. think poor decision. Let people decide want get vaccine, would allow people get it. understand, UK vaccinated it‚Äôs going fine. stop due poor media fear mongering seems.  mean humanity basically learned nothing Spanish Flu pandemic 100 years ago would learn anything one? Seems humanity doomed repeat forever. politics usa fucking nuts. People literally get assaulted political beliefs. political stickers signs property. Seriously. Take kids gloves. Hold China‚Äôs feet fire this. world letting get away actions? Silencing doctors, insisting wasn‚Äôt issue, covering up. Allowing conditions novel viruses spread. directly responsible. Part blames bonuses given vaccine 

Hear out

So recently got vaccine location X certain locations given vouchers/cash/free drinks e.g

If vaccine already given (apparently) many sit wait time given bank buck, extremely low risk anything bad happening Covid, ontop fact much change vaccinated (mask mandates/required testing) go ahead it? 

Along many said getting time many don‚Äôt bother thank much! added! wear crash helmet. Yeah, except one orange guy made political.  No, they're responsible recognizing new virus loose that's killing people, covering month. everyone vaccinated, back rotation.‚Äù

That‚Äôs never happening.   still think that, best, little naive tone deaf. I‚Äôm glad work 5 days week normie schedule everyone luxury. Including sorts weird night swing shift scheduling.

Thats first mistake, needs remembered etched history books. common chance there.

So bad get AstraZeneca vaccine jack shit South African strain? country government shown sign ditch vaccine strain detected. Agreed. different know severe happens, imagine better planning (a real stockpile N95 masks ventilators) would saved lot lives. Even year+ later, India prime example ample time prepare, losing far people be. It‚Äôs never people don‚Äôt get seriously ill it. It‚Äôs carriers people significantly impacted; get sick worse.

Eradication pipe dream COVID-19 animal reservoirs. reason smallpox could eradicated caused virus infected could carried humans. COVID-19 going eliminated anymore rabies, Ebola, malaria are. mean, think technically does‚Ä¶. get point. pretty much forced say unnecessary, submission commenting ‚Äúwas hindered helped international health regulations procedures‚Äù, said Clark. regulations govern declare public health emergency international concern adopted 2007. **They bind confidentiality verification, preventing rapid action, prohibit countries unnecessarily closing borders trade.**

During 2009 swine flu pandemic, exact opposite problem: warning loudly that, governments reacted quickly, thing never really got bad thus barely anybody even remembers used thing.

In follow-up [WHO accused due mild outcome lack mass casualties. perfectly encapsulates shitty position in: get right, prevent worst, getting accused alarmist useless, get right, get accused useless, pretty much always loss-loss them. Maybe insisting trying makes things super hard do? vape weed, e-cigs. Big difference. 

I scheduled get vaccinated end month. looking opinions hope won‚Äôt ridiculed asking questions. little evidence long-term side-effects, fatal side-effects negligible numbers compared fatalities virus. Kids still spread virus. child may danger death (which actually isn‚Äôt true variant Brazil large number babies children dying) still transmit disease people get sick die really bad side-effects. Right now, passports hot button issue sides. privacy issues idea ""sick proven healthy"" mentality taking minds since idea asymptomatic people began. 

There LOT things debated cause unrest worth.  Tar poodle hair guy said would cross borders stay April. long second dose catch covid19? September announcement, information 7 year old get vaccinated? would think would available sooner 12yos approved... Maybe it. Certainly somewhere 70% 100% depending employer. I'm sure dont worry anything reminder, took long time lot vaccination sites even offer shots outside work hours. couldn‚Äôt get 7:30 night say ‚Äúhey, extra time let‚Äôs get shot!‚Äù Disbanding emerging zoonotic disease team pretty much guaranteed would get control. Thanks trump. undersell effectiveness preventing infection calling ""pretty good."" also extremely good that. Maybe would insist pile corpses doorstep elect commission find somebody think might eventually advised pile starts growing ‚Ä¶ problem read lot. fact presuming stance vaccinations kind annoying. 

I scheduled get vaccinated end month. I‚Äôve read lot understand little recent news AZ vaccine worrisome. 

Why ok worried? Frank Herbert? think 20-50 years pandemic severe enough cause similar lockdowns. words, even though multiple pandemics past 103 years, there‚Äôs reason Covid considered ‚Äúonce century‚Äù compared 1968 flu pandemic. made clear? get vaccine basically made immune deadly pandemic ravaged world year now. mean, much clear benefit people's lives need be? time made recommendation masks unnecessary general public.

How measures would significantly effective supply masks better suited targeted responses.

Sure, that's said. justifying lie now.

Looking back admit damage public trust really bad. Legit medical student ik said THTS TRUE LIKE WTF ur supposed educated wat??? Without looking much into, heres see:

1. ~2/3rds cases people fully vaxxed

2. vaccines used high efficacy rates used developed countries

3. Lack natural immunity means non vaccinated group extremely exposed 

In US, got really lucky mRNA vaccines highly protective 2 ones getting. also extremely high natural immunity rate. likely US protection overall Seychelles due natural immunity level. US major political party moving toward anti vaxx. Anti vaxxers rare used span political spectrum. much anymore. figured people still supporting 45 insulted nearly every human planet. 

I put blame 45 shoulders COVID-19, along ass-kissing family cronies. cost somewhere 385 885 Euro. course preventable. 

First thing, shut borders. didn't. Democrats opposed Trump little late. 

Then good testing right gate knew fast spreading. didn't. CDC/FDA dropped ball. 

Then clear telling people wear masks big help. told opposite prevent hoarding. CDC messed again. 

Then governors reluctant order lockdowns people selfish follow them. percentage people need 2 days sick leave vaccine, imagine? Take guess.  Look Vietnam's number. majority vaccine doses different others received. 

While unpopular say, vaccine may effective Moderna Pfizer option. found CLEAR evidence preliminary investigation. Iirc enough evidence 2 3 days later. China responsible travel laws? zombie bite me, promise! Many people took part fucking insurrection. many ~~people~~ elected leaders trying blow past like it‚Äôs big deal. would specifically advised supposed experts? world ignore advice?  putting dollars recommend something complain taking dollars others fund chose listen Trump Literally entire country saw record case numbers winter. explain massive increases cases states like NY CA time period? Yeah, shit.  It‚Äôs combination both, I‚Äôm getting at. Getting vaccinated means believe it‚Äôll make difference. people short time money don‚Äôt feel like they‚Äôre losing anything skipping shot. make easier *and* make clear vaccine immediately make life better. feel like *exactly* fixed number -- put pressure on. 

Virus R0 rate care people feel vaccine, whether continue replicate population. thinking moving one point. Good thing chose North Carolina instead. com cov study results out? Yes, 200 countries done 4 5 actually did, could eradicated diseased today. Preventable theory, practice. vaccine isn‚Äôt cure. doesn‚Äôt kill virus. 

However significantly reduces risk getting infected, statistically rare case do, symptoms typically much milder. 

While deaths vaccinated people immensely small percentage vaccinated.  able link video? I'd love watch it. Many countries don‚Äôt mandatory vaccines schools still high percentage children vaccinated. Vaccine mandates aren‚Äôt way go. Somebody corrected topic day. That's grammatical kryptonite! way higher likelihood dying covid winding long term health issues get covid.. said glad went Moderna, AZ available iffy Johnson Johnson one (which seems like almost AZ)  translation: people generally get critically ill adaptive immunity starts kick in. suggests people get critically ill immune system overreacts producing huge number antibodies, processed differently ""normal"". difference processing causes lot inflammation. time goes on, antibodies processed better inflammation goes down. So, paper showing evidence adaptive immunity playing catch part causes severe issues, also propose treatment might help decrease inflammation critical cases that's already approved use could hopefully fast tracked. Show Western Country similar sized population that's island better, better now. countries turn. Got second dose yesterday bring concerts orgies. One demoralizing moments pandemic seeing quickly many people US abandoned idea ethical responsibility protect people. Almost romanticizing self-absorbed downside comes expecting people make sacrifices protect vulnerable!

The pandemic highlights different failures different countries. Stifling early whistleblowers China enabled spread covid there. Rampant conspiracy theories glorification ignorance selfishness allowed spread US. Global socioeconomic disparities poverty allowed spread India (and poorer, vulnerable communities worldwide suffered especially pandemic). Thank you.  don‚Äôt think need task force cost us taxes, need laws prevent spread quickly shut travel countries case outbreak. Something governments completely failed at, making things much worse could‚Äôve been. isolate reduce spread without worrying new cases coming country. That's relevant anything wrote again?

I guess least relevant submission ‚Äúwas hindered helped international health regulations procedures‚Äù, said Clark. regulations govern declare public health emergency international concern adopted 2007. **They bind confidentiality verification, preventing rapid action, prohibit countries unnecessarily closing borders trade.** think person denying (but still helpful brought up, anyone reading needs reminder)

I think main point 1918 H1N1 pandemic especially *deadly* young people way ""we know back deadly Covid happened today"" - flu pandemic would still probably kill young people Covid happened today. 

In words, Covid absolutely terrible even *WORSE* case scenario could happen future, indeed happened long ago. omg accurate tell turn drink? really care virus January-February 2020 news people urging countries ban flights china, follow news thought countries actually going control like Ebola SARS etc.

turns back stabbed end. costed 1 whole year College. 20/50 years? we‚Äôll likely see actual deadly virus within decade imo CDC says schools problem kids wear masks. problem schools gone back full time here, district still it.  Aww shit. Forgot /s. shall take stoning head held high. Right reasons examples gave boil ignorance. That's something fight, sure, LOTS ignorant people world, original excuse people ""don't time."" horseshit. me, worse that... people think 1/6 big deal move on. election stolen. I'm surprised headlines shortages tin foil mentioned. Considering tin foil hats there, I'm shocked shortage foil. Surgery stage 4 cancer much unfortunately. polands death still hover around 300-500/day (multiply 8 compare US) 15th masks restaurants open again.

there report today april 50k people died, 60% april last year. total death rate 70k almost within last months.

it‚Äôs 15th yet nobody wears mask restaurants clubs open.

go figure what‚Äôs happen next‚Ä¶ Getting kind tired CDC dragging feet everything. lost 99% world population, we'd probably lose another 80% whoever left due starvation, dehydration, diseases, hypothermia, on, would crater systems people rely survival. shall see southeast one gas right now. It‚Äôs going hard sell people get vaccinated people already vaccinated still shamed submission act though yet been. 
 
Wanna know easiest way get people vaccinated, blow open doors tell people normal, social distancing masks vaccinated. 
 
The bottom line safe now, say anything otherwise vaccinated fear mongering promoting vaccine hesitancy. everyone wants get still 2 million shots per day? Oh ok ""You know what, real argument. Instead, resort name-calling best defense got."" Breakthrough cases supposed much rarer that... 3 people ‚Äúdozens‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt rare. Vaccination speed double rest month june. fact 30's invited end june accurate, vaccinating 2,5 million+ per week, checks out. SE Asia also recent memories bird flu didn‚Äôt impact US. You. Are. Wrong. produce peer reviewed evidence, you‚Äôre fool. Agreed, many comparing year's drop last year's. believe seasonality working favor, also scared locked last year. Vaccines make us anything upticks going forward, imo. know what, never mind.

You're clearly idiot. early Germany USA come close collapse, either. USA nipping 4th wave Germany appear promise, human nature resist lockdowns change. Every country problems. People want act like USA special not.

Germans whole, much better rule followers, ton better. United states 4 times bigger population 28 tines bigger land mass. much diversity United States. Politically, economically, racially. biggest strength, also act USA case fatality rate much better Germany's officially. Even say USA well testing, still sizable difference, sizable explained testing. ‚ÄúIf world strong central health agency would explicitly acknowledge pandemic early recognize risk airborne transmission, whole ordeal could avoided.‚Äù  Well yeah. would‚Äôve closed borders earlier like Trump going do, wore masks took 2-week lockdown seriously. Uh, ok  actually think Covid pretty close optimal maximizing casualties: highly transmissible, mortality high, high enough people can't deny risk.

I mean, might worse mortality rate double (2%), time get 10% mortality gets *really hard* anyone say ""it's flu, bro."" can‚Äôt speak NL, Sweden something called ‚Äùarbetsgivaravgift‚Äù, employer-fee. basically forces employer pay additional tax employees, money used things like sick-leave things. Sometimes sub people someone else, subs usually get fat pay hike covering sick person, also funded said tax. exactly 46% sufficient number vaccinated people?

Nowhere country hit could considered herd immunity levels. Cases slowly coming down, still high levels. Deaths 700 day still.


Things opening up, that's impossible deny. policy makers started relaxing restrictions. think ""going lockdown forever"" I'd tell look outside.

But blow doors open immediately? No. still work better safeguard population go back everything normal. Tell friends get vaccinated pump numbers get cases down. 

The better numbers get, open things get even power hesitant open things up.  I'll say add side argument :

There could mechanism antibodies vaccination cause interaction future pathogen problematic. see could worse vaccinated people vs recovered people however. general seems unlikely, like unlikely. Worthy ignored, nearly. Probably not, Western countries still anything even news control Italy. two months countries could set preparations, bother really believe could get bad them. saw things getting bad chose respond, point late already spreading control start seeing things getting bad.

The way China's actions would made major difference would 100% stopped virus ever getting outside China; doubt could happened time anyone even knew it, probably already carried plane somewhere like saw UK variant others. comparing vaccines themselves. comparing messaging government push large-scale vaccinations fallout mistrust resulted rollout. arent saying vaccines arent safe. 30/40 demographic key. Moderna well. Pfizer sides less half second shot. older coworkers parents fine. people 20s/early 30s know unfortunate. open mass centres everyone? seems strange choice. That's like blaming rape victims everything could've done prevent assault. _restricted_ exports, reasonable person calls export ban. counts export ban. it. Yeah, really track excuse vast majority cases. 

I'm progressive mandating better pay benefits seems developing tendency ""play class card"", speak, whenever want excuse questionable choices behavior. limited class. I've never seen many people eager seen victims.   help: someone says hey, I‚Äôm young strong, even get covid, I‚Äôll almost certainly fine, parents/grandparents already vaxxed don‚Äôt need worry 

And hate shots I‚Äôve heard side effects basically knock day two, sounds awful 

Not personal view, rational logical patient america chances seeing bill would put back hospital. Oh man. U.S. would $1 million. insurance would still several hundred thousand dollars pocket. Yeah, basically. lot office workers work home high schools/universities partially closed. Apart restaurants/clubs close 8 arenas obviously closed. Everything else mostly normal, although I‚Äôd say social circles generally tad smaller ususal. anything, Trump administration coupled Pandemic taught us dumb human race truly is. 
 
Unfortunately experts dumb realize.  I've always wondered works exactly. company cannot go without someone job long. time I'd back someone else would've assumed role. sort timeline happening Canada (my province least). demographics skew older really picked speed getting stuck late 50s-early 60s age brackets while. sceptical got 30+ flash, relatively speaking Covid-1919 would likely killed tons cities, would spread fast news. vaccine year, valid testing, X-ray diagnosis, contact tracing, tons poorly ventilated factories workplaces.

And rural countryside, would likely killed tons well, poorly ventilated schools much smaller living spaces.

How many doctors nurses would died due high viral exposure without N95‚Äôs? Anyone Maryland, USA? think Hogan going say today press conference? happen again, guaranteed

I see happening drugs, vaccines, definitely current mRNA covid vaccines.

It's disingenuous. find example, I'd change mind.

I'm interested safety drugs. vaccines. Lol ok, keep spewing bullshit can't even explain need everyone vaccinated continual reference vaccine given 45-years ago grown tiring. Frankly term ‚Äòvaccine‚Äô H1N1 vaccine 1976 mRNA vaccines share absolutely similarities. It‚Äôs like comparing Big Wheel Ferrari. would address it? Scientific advancement happens attempts use comparison scare tactic exceedingly absurd. still acknowledge Taiwan's existence, right?..

Very sovereignty. independence. Much free. arm slightly sore bench pressing hours shot. extent experience narrative scare people away vaccines. want do, say evidence didn't? prefer lie? Except EU restrict vaccine exports months, that's refuse understand.

The EU included *possibility* restricting exports case case basis depending situation receiving countries size AZ's backlog.

As said, exports around period manufacturer (AZ) *were* allowed go through.

How justify calling export ban exports allowed go through?

You must acting willfully ignorant point. people really care understand numbers. thanks correcting that. Making mandatory insures anti-vaxxers kids infecting potentially kill classmates. 

They stay home safe 5G signals Covid over. see  merely stating fact, necessarly implying proud it. ;) vouch. Lived Tufts almost 3 years Everyone town must gotten saline control. one know got sick it, though suppose arm slightly sore gym couple hours second shot. Ok happen lot people. Happened me. can‚Äôt get time off, might worth risk. LOL see trouble numbers. Here, ATM right way. still high everyday? People acting like nothing ever happened past month half so. Lollipops don‚Äôt excite kids 12-15 years old age. offer exclusive Fortnite skin getting vaccine, line en masse. That's typically happen every 100 years due. Good habit! I‚Äôm ready Lol wow comment ridiculous, give rest, vaccines SAFE.

I see you‚Äôre active vaccine conspiracy theorist subs, must hard fear fear genuine science way lol. Let know anything else pops ‚Äúvaccinezaredadevilz‚Äù blogs international medical community may apparently missed. Exactly clever Show dozens dead students teachers. can't. people died? course. People professions died. risk comes community spread, schools. Teachers, whole, lower risk almost occupations.

If want see tragedy, look food processing workers, healthcare workers, grocery workers. personally disagree. world live in.

It‚Äôs test run, obviously real deal. Covid highly contagious doesn‚Äôt immediately incapacitate host able spread worldwide way does. It‚Äôs showing signs resistance due variants, concern. Covid EVIL people early 30s age range still says end June, months. Meanwhile, across border Flanders they're track every adult wants first shot 11th July

You're underestimating much faster campaign supposed go end June/beginning July. Early 30s age range also scheduled end June Flanders many childhood vaccines given ""mixed"" - get 2 ""brands"" polio vaccine 3.. 4 receive mixed series OPV IPV*** receive total either 3 4 doses depending age time last dose.

'Mix match' UK Covid vaccine trial expanded investigator trial Prof Matthew Snape, Oxford Vaccine Group, said hoped recruit 1,050 volunteers already received one dose NHS past eight 12 weeks. 
More 800 people already taking part research ***and received two doses either Pfizer, AstraZeneca mix.***

&amp;#x200B;

it's matter ""could"" matter much? Crises could averted given us power money.

Institutional incentives finest.  Maybe educate yourself. Excuse ignorance say using hand sanitizer. running water wash hands? Isn‚Äôt washing considered first choice sanitizer? sorry hear India‚Äôs sad state. well. hell going do?

Make everyone mad.

The problem set metrics two months ago, stuck regardless vaccine roll out, even recent cases decreasing. hospitalizations went certain number, would lockdown regardless things happening state.

It nothing case rate (which dropping already aforementioned) put people work week, made restaurants throw perishables.

It pretty much exhausted possibility lockdown again.  time.

Again well explained. lot ""Free Vaccine register for"" type advertisements aimed demographics part of. I've say 'the vaccine goddam free' people literally social workers. lot messaging reaching even English speakers. test run pandemic. deadly, level previous illnesses. something scale Spanish Flu blow earth, we'll tragedy never seen before.

As counterpoint, COVID-19 right sort sweet spot innocuous deadly. really cold even average flu, almost one would stay home one stays home illnesses, risk death serious complications remote altering life beyond washing hands sneezing elbow would ridiculous. COVID deadly like Ebola, EVERYONE would stayed home even public health officials declared generally safe, many would stay home make sure, wants virus makes internal organ hemorrhage kills like 90% people catch it.

&amp;#x200B;

Instead, COVID-19 deadly 1% people caught it, generally elderly populations people relatively rare immunosuppressive disorders. debilitating undetermined number long-haulers, governments report care differentiate figures many people getting chronic systems COVID infections. many people, really look like bad cold recovered.

&amp;#x200B;

So faced news really likely die disease 80 chronically ill, understand lot people never took seriously treated public health response overreaction (it's tempting even conclude public health officials overreacted, stayed fully distanced home exception picking grocery orders fully vaccinated). think necessarily precludes serious response public pandemic much higher death rate profound, reported-on symptoms gruesome deaths disabilities. reports otherwise healthy 30-somethings getting limbs amputated strokes clotting issues. I'm vaccine pokemon. obviously didn‚Äôt read article. Yep. coworkers opposed shot, heard pill Pfizer testing end symptoms want wait now...

Ugh. Here's literature review number different studies findings Covid's impact erectile dysfunction last year. new information, ongoing research: surprised. Didn‚Äôt study last year find virus attracted ACE receptors scrotum? alternatively start strong robust 5 10 years pandemics really anyone's mind anymore cut skeleton crew kept low levels on. happen all, Japan would gotten AZ vaccines EU. instead, bloc restricted exports AZ vaccine months got America. yeah, clearly export ban, even short. comment nothing weaseling attempt EU real life thing. dozens studies Covid's impact reproductive health last year. surprising negative impact cardiovascular health Covid cause.

Since blood flow important men women comes reproductive activities.  needed surgery due life threatening issue, delayed. backlog things life threatening ensure surgeries take place.

That's triage works. highlight study vaccination promotion campaigns  vaccine save us, reduced mortal threat one that's far run mill. Yeah Japan futuristic people think, went wild electronics 80s really good robotics. behind times now. refuse, guess going Disneyland summer. Guess who's getting awesome video game wanted. Guess who's going Angels game. 

We need emphasize greater good, also wearing pants household. many kids run parents lives days. conservative media make sense. think idea arguing point. Anyone desire vaccine ability go get one right moment. idea word salad trying say.

Take care. Masks look still required indoora Exciting. lets go bois first study,  4 men ED undergoing surgery erection prosthetic.   2 COVID penis, two not.

Export authorizations may still granted threat posed availability relevant equipment EU member states, various special circumstances ban discriminate full tiny.

Evidently, does. Yeah think that‚Äôs fair. IMO moment fauci even hinted possible inevitably ending soon Neither pandemics hit US effect covid did, react fashion society. best vaguely comparable covid. 

You'd also close 70 remember much 58. bnorn 69 remember outbreak, I've never heard anyone family even discuss it. Yeah people don‚Äôt starve many people. starve supply Thoroughly owned Well mask mandate rescinding local locations excluded schools, actions show otherwise Interesting! idea GPs plentiful there... Canada challenging find family doctor many don‚Äôt one, rely GPs rollout we‚Äôd sunk lol

Our mass centres run community centres like, least province, space doctor‚Äôs office go super fast. there‚Äôs strong GP network already, perhaps seemed inefficient pull people work centres.  Amen lol!!! Exactly. That's community too. live area county officials next counties told businesses citizens consider Covid prevention measures strictly voluntary last spring. So, many locally owned businesses never required masks, corporate owned businesses enforced company wide mask policies, local restaurants never lowered seating capacity, community events activities like church services festivals continued normal. yeah, husband high risk either stayed home drove populated areas high mask compliance run necessary errands year fully vaccinated. Now? people masks hardly anyone else community gives damn? protect case we're rare post-vaccine asymptomatic carrier? care us entire year waited vaccine vaccines freely available walk ins want one. believe Covid even serious threat. think we're stupid ever wearing mask getting vaccinated. protect rare unvaccinat-able person? They're public around unmasked unvaccinated people already. Us low percentage locals fully vaccinated already protecting them. protect us possible variant one carrying defeat vaccines? doctor said extremely negligible risk. performative act, display political stance? care less. husband says he's done, unless doctor says there's new threat vaccines might cover, he's wearing masks places masks required recommended signs posted. that's hardly anywhere county, populated areas. I've around public populated areas they're still least suggesting people wear masks inside businesses, do. That‚Äôs happened. People California didn‚Äôt follow rules. isn‚Äôt kids went school state people went work. Texas went work too. Texas California surges time. people wanting stay home. enough. Texas schools went back people started feel normal resumed social...and California... people gathered holidays. That‚Äôs happened. wasn‚Äôt one states went work. People didn‚Äôt follow guidelines. researched, figured bad flu travelled anyway.

Didn't help pResdent time said thing. Often. Loudly. front cameras. remember hearing back November Suddenly, seemingly inexplicable reasons, lot people suddenly start believing importance getting vaccinated.   Guessing happen NY well. bars restaurants 100% capacity fool's errand enforce masking. means privately opposed shot.

There tested available fix available right now, skipping potential symptom fix road, may may available general specific when/if needed. Well, think majority listen, took cause massive outbreaks. #***You say.*** going drawer coming out. think people addicted angry, fox news fuels  Japan handled covid well all. thousands cases day. likely grossly underreporting get Olympics happen.

Anyone knows long Aztrazeneca Sinovac vaccines last expire storage? country risk expired vaccines due slow roll delayed deliveries. Nice dodge. correct answer ""significantly number could possibly vaccinate today"" instantly shoots ""anyone wants could get it"" meme. Like clearly not, clearly even vaccinate 10 million people today, fraction unvaccinated population, less 5 days worth shots. make subreddit  bitter news people lost suffered past year. ""Show western country...."" get twisted here. Western countries high standard. US, UK, coutries Europe idiot mentality good chunk citizens think invincible.

China Taiwan lock shit cases 6 20 start popping again. That's view pandemic. We? see couple thousands cases daily........PER STATE like norm. gonna put argument, use western country gold standard.  Wanna know easiest way get people vaccinated, blow open doors tell people normal, social distancing masks vaccinated.

Which would require vaccine passport system. many fighting that.

Plenty states (CO among them) already come reduced restrictions vaccinated tied restrictions %vaccinated. appear caused inflection point.

Go pull polls hesitancy, ""nothing changes"" going rank high reasons.

For reason reddit really latched this, anything really backs up. American also old.

My impression New Gingrich constantly investigating Clinton various bullshit, that's went full dark side.

It's strange kid 1980ies remember conservatives decent people values. Maybe best values, seem like they'd lie cheat ANYTHING order get way. blame people thinking mask mandates would long outlast usefulness? articles recently saying ‚Äúvaccinations required college campuses, masking still required.‚Äù

Is hard stretch think mask requirements would still place NY, MA, CA fall? don‚Äôt live states. live Canada recently started use AZ

Edit: weeks ago Canada obtained stock AZ states even though US said wouldn‚Äôt even use population. GPs way capacity centers. Thats thing could think (context: around 50.000GPs Germany. Centers also usually bigger cities) Step 1. Get rid ignorant.

Also, Astrazeneca also data large scale US trial efficacy listed 76% two doses. criterion considered covid cases functionally identical trials. What's important remember real world data incredibly flukey. real world effectiveness numbers likely come comparing rates infection vaccinated groups rate infection unvaccinated individuals country. That's ripe bias. Different vaccines tend delivered different locations, different locations tend different rates infection. Thus, one vaccine prominent areas lower rates infection dispersed locations high rates infection, former advantage. bias could disappear one takes account rates infection specific areas vaccine distributed. one possible example bias. would US government suspend travel specifically telling countries suspend flights China?

None 100%. yes, still 5%.  people deadlines. boyfriend get first shot two weeks ago he's self employed. also wish could take breaks general. Uhh, pretty sure CDC going tell quarantine exposed known covid case regardless vaccine status. safer, UNLIKELY spread it, casinos rich players aren't. Hence analogy. time, everyone vaccinated chance spread almost 0. we're yet. spreading deadly disease right now. Nearly half Detroit's adult population functionally illiterate. somehow doubt disgusting medical experiment ended 50 years ago driving factor here. imagine general distrust ""system"" complacency. agree. see comments people talking basically haven‚Äôt left house year half covid, confused. masked went out. Didn‚Äôt touch face. Washed hands used hand sanitizer frequently. took precautions get sick. didn‚Äôt live house fear death. aunt thinks still wear mask doesn‚Äôt want catch freaking cold. 

I mean, kidding me? Colds shit part life. point restricting permanently avoid sniffles. 

People still afraid covid fully vaccinated ridiculous. People don‚Äôt understand immunity works also ridiculous (The vaccine going wear 6 months!!! Also, 95% immunity really high catch covid, it‚Äôll probably like cold thanks vaccine!) 

This sub frustrates me. well fearful people life. sorry reddit, ""America bad dumb"" posts allowed That‚Äôs crazy. shows stock market nothing reality. best guide lines future, someone going make exception fianc√© fly flight make sisters wedding epidemic turns pandemic

You know, countries, things called quarantining travel restrictions, right? inject vaccine non-dominate arm.

I've told better get shots dominate arm move around use give less arm pain long run. Who‚Äôs talking j&amp;j besides you? Chinese nationals fly country

Shouldn't destination countries making decisions? same. couldn‚Äôt see friends school, couldn‚Äôt go weekends, jobs, didn‚Äôt eat socialize person.  online shopped finally go stores. 

We restrictive almost worked. three sons got Covid spring. One college two high school athletics three weeks Abbott lifted mask mandate. players didn‚Äôt want miss baseball season (it canceled last spring get but....) went school obvious symptoms. Whole team got quarantined several got sick, sons included.

Luckily husband already vaccinated. Vaccines work, didn‚Äôt get sick. older boy HS even gotten first dose got sick, close. P R J E C N well long. Sadly complacency seems set time transmissible strains emerged.

This awful, close vaccine roll too. work well flu. Use next time sick go out. good practice considering others, common see west covid. I'm trying judge anyone's situation. judge judgement hypothetical person worried feeling crummy one day missing day work protect getting virus keep work week potentially much longer.

But think much argument worth anyway. NYT managed find one guy allegedly example this, guy miraculously found time get shot first interview article published. going need give lot proof convince there's significant population people really want shot can't find two days six weeks apart deal side effects. think thing. NYT article commentary inequality America disguised Covid article. Commonwealth continues win field it. great day Bay Stater! Fall River stand up! point showing masks weren‚Äôt successful preventing spread? town get reports every kid tests positive school. lot. incidents spread schools though, even though distancing less 6 feet allowed. Everyone mask time schools. whole household fully vaccinated, weeks following second doses back Feb/March/April. 

I've still remained cautious enough, wearing masks public spaces, going bars, restaurants, movies. variants high transmission rate vaccine hesitancy county still concern me. 

My parents hand, acted like vaccines get-out-of-jail-free cards. Dad's back old watering hole consecutive weeks -- masks, distancing, indoor smoking, mixture vaccinated unvaccinated people. risky idea imo, even fully vaxxed. that's top pretty much bothering mask public places. 

Mom's way. like wearing mask, though prior vaccination. pretty much enters shop building without mask unless someone tells put follow store rules. 

She's going today get covid test woken fever, chills body aches. We're hoping something else, though flu season gone, flu almost non-issue past year due masking/distancing, likely one breakthrough cases. never ‚Äúdecent people values‚Äù though. nationalistic racist opportunists. want return 1800‚Äôs oligarchs acted impunity. return indentured servitude modern twist. 

They accomplished hijacking religious zealots white rage. observers history 2000 election stolen. took amazingly short time, 1980-2000, complete. It‚Äôs classic defeat within tactics.

Demonizing opposition consolidating key populations. case consolidation voting blocks gerrymandering 1996 2000 election. amount veracity gerrymandering years astonishing effective.

Coming back US breakup probably stupidest thing I've ever done extremely stupid life.  ""India"" variant ok, ""Indian"" problematic. 

Notice, called UK variant, British Anglo-Saxon variant. china responsibility honest truthful, government not? Also, humanly possible transmit disease vaccinated, come contact known carrier less two weeks, quarantining, putting people risk. I'm sorry, live China world even better squashing pandemic, convinced are. control narrative especially forthcoming weak spots.

How much improvement would gotten shutting schools completely year would worth repercussions? Teachers getting paid parents find child care entire year? Students already struggle retaining learned summer break, entire year school would set back one year would require substantial amount refresh old material. Seems extreme unwarranted. really brings worst people.

Im curious people reusable masks we‚Äôve acquired last year Even US , 500k COVID deaths highest world got vaccine.

Even India things mentioned, highly unlikely could handled COVID. 

It disaster already happened , every health expert would known. little government could done , short China - India either. need teach coming generation lessons critical thinking evaluate information come across able validate correctness. 


I already seen much ridiculous stuff even comprehend someone could even come first place. I‚Äôm glad able to, I‚Äôm judging haven‚Äôt able yet. don‚Äôt know situations. wake every morning comfortably assured don‚Äôt Covid. make 5%. took 95%, one would go back. you, vaccinated 66 95% chance getting covid, almost 100% dying it. AWESOME! 

But room known covid carrier casino. time given enough wagers, casino's gonna get 1%-5% people's money. shittier proposition chilling covid kid say sitting blackjack table expecting win. Children generally risk idea need save children never goal ending pandemic. It‚Äôs another goal post moved yet again. reason schools closed well reason kids wore masks school prevent community spread, everyone risk actually dying and/or overwhelming hospital system chance get vaccinated. honestly think removing masks schools would significantly change anything.  level incompetence vaccination phase pandemic truly staggering. Especially since due travel bubble NZ, NZ likely ensnared nonsense. kiwi seen elderly relatives year, prospect wait another year mind numbing considering success countries like US UK rapidly ending pandemic.

Though least I'm glad hear they're digging guess. Also Spain. Students must start wearing masks school turn 12. Imagine something like ebola contagious something like measles. we'd fucked. 86% protected might disagree you. selfish countries do. B.1.617 variant first identified India October 2020. first cases variant detected countries February 2021. Researchers UK determined B.1.617 variant transmissible May 2021 declared variant concern. 5 months steps taken isolate B.1.617 area identified evidence dangerous. would suggest error side caution assume newly identified variant dangerous proven otherwise. Let's honest here, pretty much every bad thing happens preventable. I'm saying. study, one person hospitalised. Given medical staff working worst hit COVID-zone world presumably getting pretty big viral load, it‚Äôs clear vaccines job. Another surge? one? tell India league own. Pardon lack sympathy, kind seeing fruit nonchalant attitude. remember correctly, China 80 case thing last year locked city. Taiwan, days ago 6 7 cases. even want know people violate quarantine procedures. That's mentality. state looking 3000+ daily cases we're like....""Oh, another day."" city trying fine people early days breaking mandatory mask indoor governor like....""No, allow it"" kind message send? definitely appreciated totally agree :) thank help! message vaccines ineffective still worried infected covid vaccinated come contact covid positive person? Largely cytokine storms secondary bacterial infections people 1918 means treat/ prevent. Agreed last sentence, vaccine available everyone. fact kids still can't get vaccine means over. kids die mean life long issues may deal with. See recent article covid material detected erectile tissue? Probably jumped 'data in' stance, would rather children get possible side effects vaccine heavily tested safety risk getting sick new virus know wrecks human body. Duhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh longer incubation period, longer period asymptomatic transmissability, takes far time killing victims Spanish Flu did. would explosive first noticed new city point infected individual could walking around spreading disease hundreds people two weeks. misinterpreting comment right? think casinos win money slot machines pay 95% time. Seriously, reading something wrong here?  Mostly C.  Remember first month could get tested visited China. lot people should‚Äôve tested weren‚Äôt np thanks.

While actually many vaccines go around, somewhat ""vaccine hesitant"" population... actually want get it, do... finding to, I'm glad.  Well, people always allowed wear choose. likely always spot random person wearing one on. scientists care culture war; they'll rescind restrictions science says vast majority people stop wearing period weeks months. Like original point said ... people never lived pandemic scale. 58 69 way majority world's population would aware things like that, neither pandemics serious covid. mentioned another comment, majority Spanish Flu deaths secondary bacterial infections took advantage weakened immune systems damaged lungs initial viral infection swept through. Modern antibiotics antivirals would prevented many deaths, particularly young adults.

Like Influenza viruses, Spanish Flu much shorter incubation period survive long outside host nCov SARS-2 can, meaning less contagious ways.

On top factors, *speed* Spanish Flu came killed seemingly healthy person terrifying. primary records doctors, nurses, soldiers, witnesses pandemic noted person could wake feeling fine, feel little hoarse throat noon, suffocate fluids next day due explosively virus subsequent bacterial infections would hit body. incubation period believed line Influenza viruses, far shorter Covid, quickly would incapacitate many victims would limit ability spread quickly stealthily Covid can, would less strain healthcare infrastructure due quickly killed hosts.

So, I'd argue Covid-19 hit back 1918, would likely par deadly Spanish Flu population time ventilators, antibiotics, respirators, life saving technology medicine today. would also prove straining medical infrastructure time due long could last infected individual. Everyone always points toilet paper shortage example mass idiocy, iirc really wasn‚Äôt.

Basically, happened every workplace shut down, massive shift demand workplace-type TP (which tends thin shitty, pun intended), towards home TP (which much softer/thicker). initial shortages TP, caused public worry buy available, caused mass shortages.

So really quite rational ""Making people aware"" understandable suppose. comments seem bit excessive, IMO. came say... PFIZER GANG Man, Pfizer make killing pandemic. First vaccine, Viagra. US joke leadership last 4 years. con man surrounded criminals. top COVID policy advisor end term advocating everyone get disease. shot good outcome. personally know one gotten mumps measles

It took 5 years, 1963 1968, MMR vaccine really seed population get cases manageable levels. Even 1968, still occasional outbreaks. We're good start COVID vaccines kind change certain people want see going happen year, even almost universal acceptance vaccines. average payout win time. Yes, think that. fact, think this. lot things. Yet are. hell? Russians this? pandemic team, trumpty dumpty got rid it. 

Sadly think points absolutely right. Money always comes first people continue wet markets wild animals... I‚Äôm TX kids district choice go person stay virtual. chose person regrets. nervous decision now, hindsight, right. Mental health huge factor - much better mentally kids go everyday. Also, virtual home learning works self directed kids. learn much better classroom.

With said district loose teachers Covid. worth it? families. 

Another observation, point, part Covid spread schools due masks, distancing. exception sports. multiple outbreaks kids take masks there.

The teachers kids know personally got Covid non-school social events like weddings, birthdays, etc. said quite time 14 day thing, enough, full 30 day lock maybe. also said..its workers care facilities. ones 1.

I worry Covid different regard, concerning number reasons. do.

Ever gotten life insurance screening? yet outlets like New York Post write thing titles like: ‚Äú49 Fully Vaccinated People Across NY State Test Positive COVID, Three Hospital‚Äù [archive link anyone trouble accessing article create rules boundaries get time alone lockdowns. Bedrooms sacred spaces. knock occupant declines, leave (applies everyone house). day kids screen time, partner alternate.

But I‚Äôm Canada HARD lockdowns right now. Exactly.

Freedom choice must come ownership consequences. I'm cynicism.  prefer alternative nomenclature, oxidane. supposed upload picture vaccination card. yes bit invasive easy cheat on. it‚Äôs something.

Yes.

The UK used EU, portion laws made Brussels.

Those laws were, part, still laws applied last December Brexit transition period.

In case, made clear link, law said 'The EMA body responsible approving vaccines, emergency, member states approve vaccines themselves'

Unlike majority (but all) EU countries chose tie EU's centralised vaccination scheme misplaced political 'solidarity' , UK chose rely regulator, previously allowed EU law, still allowed UK law.

The EMA used based London year ago MHRA inherited large number staff institutional expertise, able act quickly competently EMA itself.

You trying give EU credit literally legally forcing members wait EU approval provide medicine citizens others giving away vaccine? using it. sounds like prioritizing money citizens  It‚Äôs requiring uncomfortable sweaty mask hard fact based reason continue so.  demotivating people mild safety concerns. nothing changes life vaccine, 35 yrs old, risk factors would blame saying what‚Äôs point I‚Äôm still thing foreseeable future. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, fully vaccinated wife too. encounter lot people fence specifically point CDC feedback post-vaccine leaves lot desired vaccine without decades long safety risk. get that.

[Ministry Health](http://www.health.gov.sc/) greatly overwhelmed. Facebook page replete complaints release enough date information. 

A 'bright side', one, vaccine breakthroughs SinoPharm AstraZeneca vaccines. latter end bad press including reports low efficacy variants, former performed poorly clinical trials countries. Gao Fu, head Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, even [accidently last month. know breakdown two vaccines, likely nobody knows time reasons given above. anger counts anger! ""Double mutations"". Oh Good Lord, people still using meaningless term? mutations occur outside India well! See non-Indian originated variant. understand frustration agree 100% timing either, replied another comment, things consider.

1. General public became eligible receive second vaccine dose past Monday - that's able get Pfizer appointment first week. Give weeks everyone able get second dose get past 2 week waiting period, think they'll push forward reopening timeline things continue trending better.
2. Reopening nothing ordeal. Boston followed many aspects reopening - lifting outdoor mask mandate, increasing stadium capacity limits, re-opening schools, etc. 
3. slightly prioritizing public health commerce - although explicitly state this, moving timeline forward would lead excess hospitalizations/deaths, etc. vs. allowing businesses still closed restricted resume normal operations. Huge? like three days. risk Covid.  F) concerned strength economy tied reelection saving lives. Anything could affect economy (e.g. shutdowns) avoided.

G) idea handle situation (despite existence Bush Obama era pandemic playbooks) foisted responsibility onto states could blame anything went wrong. Lol deniers gonna get Children Men-ed looking context, think that's contact vaccine, vaccinated person. Small sample size. glad there‚Äôs data released related Indian variant. can‚Äôt see anyway state keeps mask mandate California isn‚Äôt going one. pandemic something becomes main cause death? killed 0.2% population. since deaths lagging indicator, they're gonna keep falling. may ask, WHOMST? like ask, WHOMSTISN'T? media 2021. Push narrative cater crowd, everyone true believer like wtf, obviously playing facts. they. listened lot meeting online earlier today.  father 12 year old, getting vaccinated soon possible. already reached pediatrician works existing schedule. 

I feel extremely comfortable getting son vaccination. think great make feel safe school various activities.  Hopefully, find appointment weekend. crap.... ""Studies show people still dumb shit!""

Tale old time. authority anything political gamesmanship recall always DOA. easy drum enough signatures put something ballot CA, detriment times. Getting votes completely different story.

The polling support recall flat 36-38% since forever, (unsurprisingly) republican got last gubernatorial election.

The people hated newsom 2018 still hate want recalled, people voted vote again. Hopefully. like homelessness preventable climate change preventable! overlord, Money, won‚Äôt abide though. many tendies  Thank you. Wtf love McDonald's That's true look strict statistics.

Covid: 582,000

Spanish Flu: 650,000

However, 103.2 million people US 1918 SF hit. 328.2 million people US now. impact Spanish Flu society time FAR greater. forget expose people highly deadly/contagious flu every year? Yeah we'd started putting cow poo earlier everything would OK Yeah double mutations happen 300,000 infected single day real. I'm extremely busy introvert. Normally probably 5 nights week concerts, movies, sporting events, theatre, trivia nights, etc. means drag ass home hour night, matter tired, need one solid hour wind go sleep.  (both sides) politicized everything it. Whatever Trump said wrong half population, whatever Fauci said wrong half - includes congress. response Trump trying shut travel China (which would helped) stop so, extend travel restrictions rest world. wish could considerate children wait also vaccinated. feel like mask minor inconvenience compared kids lives permanent lung damage I‚Äôm feeling alone that. Hormonal, vascular, neurological, psychological. little left behind. CDC issued guidelines well. CA allowing appointments scheduled starting tomorrow. elder daughter soon possible. Water wet  great info thank J&amp;J available. Kinda wonder cares point. many states returning refusing current allotments, would seem thing stopping 100% vax availability coast coast efficient delivery. Got get needed instead current formula.

Maybe kids starting change things.

I wonder value J&amp;J mix &amp; match booster later year. think they're studying sort thing currently. OxAZ might useful ever get around finishing US trial. trump said close borders China, instead called xenophobe would‚Äôve better off. Nice. First off, yes, know vaccine effective. That's got soon could. person I'm trying protect. parent 3 children cannot get vaccinated yet. Furthermore, job go multiple nursing homes area. know reduced chance spread corona, cost happening rather high. No, rest easy quite yet. probably rest easy least kids able vaccinated region reached semblance herd immunity. answer always ""Give us power!"". Yep, bending China, probably could been.  started suppressing information mid December, continued well January. insurer paid Thankfully no, every country  you, realize response might come across critical too. I'm necessarily even defending Aug 22 reopening date. 

I think gets tricky there's whole lot grey area comes reopening. lot people want finish line completely flip switch/declare end COVID single date marks everything back ""normal"". Personally, I'm fine continuing reasonable restrictions within reasonable time frame - far city state followed many aspects reopening, i.e. lifting outdoor mask mandate, increasing stadium capacity limits, public schools, etc. might agree exact timeline even capacity limits public private gatherings going raised matter weeks.

Consider first week 2nd became available general public, that's able manage Pfizer appointment right away. weeks pass people fully chance get vaccines hit full 2 week waiting period, think we'll see restrictions open even so.  Yup stop eating animals, factory meat many diseases stop mean yes, complain things unfair hard? ""Most"" ""probably"" comforting trying protect asthmatic child. Awesome! give nice little shot arm first dose numbers second half May. would stay home? go wear mask wants to. Dr. Strangelove. Same. I‚Äôve always optimistic idealist‚Ä¶ now, misathrope, totally understand point view misanthrope‚Ä¶ 

I keep wondering many people always crappy? Scheduled kid Friday. Freaking excited done worry. also help bring immunity community. Thats really odd you. ""not level previous illnesses"", meant Polio, Spanish Flu, Black Death, etc. still largest pandemic people seen. Hell yes!!!!!!! can‚Äôt wait summer. beach bars going much fun. Damn that's cheap, Germany 105 day hospital stay would cost 1050 ‚Ç¨ (10 ‚Ç¨ per day). Though earn 50k ‚Ç¨ per year since payment capped 2% yearly income. lack perspective. Yeah might feel like shit day second shot. know make take MUCH time work? Catching Covid. look article, see simple case terrible definition. Merriam-Webster's definition ""anti-vaxxer"" seems different people would understand term. would male study participant expose someone else?   preventable almost every stage.

I elaborate much, China least at-fault here. Xi Jinping's credit, enact strictest lockdown nation get cases minimal levels. could locked much sooner prevented whole pandemic first place, maliciously intend spread virus achieve ""herd immunity"" way.

Certain world leaders (i.e. Donald Trump, Boris Johnson, Jair Bolsonaro) disregarded pandemic way hope Interpol bring Hague over. could use nice population decrease tbh California lower case rates high vax rates NC? another case Merriam-Webster deliberately political definitions, stupid? 28 days later I'd get another shot. knew could live forever long took shot every 28 days, I'd shit like nobody's business.  It‚Äôs fire season west, useful fall Here‚Äôs little perspective predicated people getting vaccinated. Children don‚Äôt typically get measles vaccine 12 months. know measles outbreaks real, don‚Äôt really think carting around infants handle via vaccines public health measures like contact tracing. maybe kids little reckless didn‚Äôt think it. suspect I‚Äôm alone though‚Ä¶

Personal story: family Disneyland unvaccinated 9 month old later learned middle big measles outbreak. unscathed, goes show risk never hits zero approaches zero.

My point: COVID scary, measles many diseases. Let‚Äôs base policy conditions ground. 10/100,000 case rates *and* people get vaccinated, think it‚Äôs fair begin framing much way something like measles.  going total end mask mandate, look here:

""Only settings indoor -- massively large settings people around world, around country, convening, people mixing real dense spaces,""

As long still place mask mandate really over. California, anywhere. good true. Pfizer selling cost? thought AZ? even pandemic over. Booster shots profit. 

Just looking booster shots EU ordered stock price going roof. think going buy stocks, someone super undervalued. *in 3-5 years. pandemic taught anything, I'm much introvert thought am. mean, difficult anyone go whole year half (almost), right pandemic started, thought I'd okay thought one quiet types really active socially. Now, safely say pandemic ends, I'm gonna go hang friends/try meet new people much before. know pandemic, personality growth. Next year last college, hopefully restrictions/guidelines loose really enjoy time may lot anti-vaxxers way high. may speak feelings loudly, majority country‚Ä¶

Edit: yes read define anti-vaxxers vaccine mandates too‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm still sure think it‚Äôs high. anything, think majority country probably indifferent vaccine mandates. Something relevant vaccination covid19 likely cause bit confusion ""modified"" part phrase also part description ""modified live"" vaccine smallpox. apparently eliminated along regular smallpox. Here's may help clear confusion. seems name 'Alastrim' refers two different things. One naturally circulating mild form disease another modified live virus vaccines 'reverted virulence"", full, nasty high mortality virulence merely ""getting bit sick"" virulence. high incidence vaccinated patients suggests cases due vaccine reversion virulence. ordinary smallpox fatality rate 30% 'modified smallpox' killed less 1% contracted it. sound like ending altogether, though. Look quote:

""Only settings indoor -- massively large settings people around world, around country, convening, people mixing real dense spaces,""

Those still going remain even next month. knew good true. End mask mandate restrictions removed it, too. Period. partial removal."" ‚ÄúMonths.‚Äù Inspires confidence. Think smart average person is. think half people earth dumber matter. need check humanity. bother replying. - time posted (an hour ago), news CDC endorsement yet broken
- Vaccine hesitancy huge problem sitting FDA recommendation vaccinate significant chunk population (in opinion) slows momentum
- optics alone FDA recommendation Monday CDC meeting Wednesday bad
- messaging administration ""everybody get vaccinated ASAP,"" think delay detracts urgency.  China tried cover months. 

So buy this. World leaders sat down, forced watch Contagion. loosely based SARS pandemic, albeit much dangerous virus. maybe would got pay attention. eery life immitated art. many popular articles news sources continue say permanent masked/restricted state new normal forever.

ex: people insane ridiculous media covers covid like this. Good. almost students vaccinated, college life much closer normal. kind want mask mandate anti-maskers anti-vaxxers, don‚Äôt see stupid mouth holes dumb words come of. read book? CDC acknowledged pandemic going actually led country rather burying heads sand, started testing earlier frequently, ""leadership"" public health minded rather politically minded, we'd much different place today. Korea small outbreak knew China full it. world trusted China beginning. Never again. don‚Äôt need quarantine getting vaccinated. immune system doesn‚Äôt know care. ignore several different international authority figures still can't come actual studies, become conspiracy theorist. CDC says spread flu day point crazy number underlying cases don‚Äôt know people don‚Äôt want tested. don‚Äôt need know cases spread.... whole point aren‚Äôt huge number cases undetected people won‚Äôt go test even sick. cases would show eventually. shooter school.

Kn95 ones useful house work anyway sanding things etc.

It may bad idea wear masks medical offices either next flu season.   California announcing less end mask mandate month amazing! I'm honestly shocked. someone CA, truly thought they'd drag mandate long humanely possible.

Although, imagine slow, slow return normalcy social level here. doubt even mandate lifts, vast majority CA natives (especially SoCal) continue wear masks political statement quite while. think ""dirty looks"" wearing mask even required keep occurring throughout summer here, unfortunately. Hello, i'll first injection Pfizer friday night heard quarantaine days injection let immune system time react vaccine. true? reporting covid cases mean covid free. wrong judge people they're wearing mask. warnings/bans justified.

It's also wrong judge people they're wearing mask outside. might vaccinated, CDC said safe.

Just stop judging people, period. want wear mask, wear it. don't, don't. We're past point need tell people do, get vaccinated. many conflicting sources I'll err side caution. CDC website still lists asthma. child hospitalized 3 days asthma flared common cold. still finished paying bill. Well right, big country that's ""huge mess"". gay crocodile, too! shit lie something easily meteor could hit earth time yet don‚Äôt live fear it. starters, quoting much smaller number people fully vaccinated?

Because number people fully vaccinated. 1 dose good, I'd rather public policy based number fully protected. much better data protection provides 1 use 1 doses? 

I mean, think [Vermont's high enough? don't. Florida's 45% 1st dose %. Yeah, got time get 2nd shots, that's still pretty weak number. hmm far even able completely supply full planned medical studies... guess still significant issue supply chain. 
But China started exporting raw materials vaccine situation ease soon EU also track approving chinese vaccine US might move scope. average age die? hard, fully vaxed still feel comfortable dining indoor. Part since plenty outdoor options.

I downgrade surgical masks though kn95 shopping meeting vaccinated people indoors now. imagine see masks office buildings fall. liability high private employers outbreak office. 282 children died entire pandemic via covid. CDC‚Äôs definition children even includes 12-17 get vaccinated. 

of course number zero, certain point doesn‚Äôt make sense continue restrictions 300,000,000 adults save less one child day. especially considering EUA children could months months away considering took six months 12-15

It‚Äôs still pertinent argument near/distant future though. covid still transmittable virus matter age. Children little haven‚Äôt learned proper manners basic hygiene. That‚Äôs reason many kids get sick around school. could also bring back grandparents might unvaccinated, lots levels thing.

Keep mind Israel uses Vaccine Passports though. That's anathema even liberal California. Hehehaha good point.  Even community masks \*now\* proven big effect, reducing transmission Covid 40 %.

Aims 
To explore variables associated serological response following COVID‚Äê19 mRNA vaccine. 
 
Methods 
Eighty‚Äêsix healthcare workers adhering vaccination campaign COVID‚Äê19 enrolled January‚ÄìFebruary 2021. subjects underwent two COVID‚Äê19 mRNA vaccine inoculations (Pfizer/BioNTech) separated 3 weeks. Blood samples collected 1st 1‚Äì4 weeks second inoculation. Clinical history, demographics, vaccine side effects recorded. Baseline anthropometric parameters measured, body composition performed dual‚Äêenergy‚ÄêX‚Äêray absorptiometry. 
 
Results 
Higher waist circumference associated lower antibody (Ab) titres (R = ‚àí0.324, p = 0.004); smokers lower levels compared non‚Äêsmokers \[1099 (1350) vs. 1921 (1375), p = 0.007\], well hypertensive versus normotensive \[650 ¬± 1192 vs. 1911 (1364), p = 0.001\] dyslipideamic compared normal serum lipids \[534 (972) vs 1872 (1406), p = 0.005\]. Multivariate analysis showed higher waist circumference, smoking, hypertension, longer time elapsed since second vaccine inoculation associated lower Ab titres, independent BMI, age. gender. 
 
Conclusions 
Central obesity, hypertension, smoking associated lower Ab titres following COVID‚Äê19 vaccination. Although currently impossible determine whether lower SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2 Abs lead higher likelihood developing COVID‚Äê19, well‚Äêestablished neutralizing antibodies correlate protection several viruses including SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2. findings, therefore, call vigilant approach, subjects central obesity, hypertension, smoking could benefit earlier vaccine boosters different vaccine schedules. Krispy Kreme already giving donuts  What‚Äôs danger level party fully vaccinated people except two people one shot in? hopeful‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs hope trend continues.  Okay makes lot sense, thank you! keep forgetting 2 doses get excited see really high number vaccinations! Thanks again- always scary ask questions online lol based Also beginning told us masks completely unnecessary. 180 that...  Yup incentivizing method improving ones life would great. humans inherently selfish (and good evolutionary reason) building stature security up. thanks DPA EU struggling manufactor supply export vaccines..

But put things perspective. production might currently limited due DPA, EU currently far outpacing region terms current production capacity. produced around numbers China early May. Thus well 400 million vaccines. produced around 80 100 million vaccines US. considerably country producing large quantities, like India Russia. differences becoming greater, initial EU production capacity quite low (similar US production capacity), production much higher rate place world, still expanding production capacity. choice fast supply many countries rely China Russia use massive political influence. India looked like winner well , 2nd wave came.

Also doses exported facilities EU, 200 million vaccines exported. similar China, also exported 200 million vaccines. countries exported significantly less. Combine exports countries excluding China, still even come close half EU vaccine exports.

Now EU learned lesson, gradually making sure cut most/all US companies/facilities steps vaccine manufacturing eventually critical supplies. example, newest EU contract 1.8 billion BioNTech vaccine doses states production steps materials must sourced within EU. even handicap, EU outproducing US, difference become greater. Lol, salvaging coffee everything. Wow. Good strategy. Yah gonna worst covid state Im afraid, really surprising India getting 20 M. curious see ""most"" meant. course they're keeping mask mandate.

God damn people obsessed keeping them. Like, give damn ending threshold. could easily flip argument right back you. child developed depression, resulting ripple effects lead life filled less happiness otherwise would have.

Three cases worldwide. One conversation China, one multi-day picnic Germany, one construction work site Singapore. scientifically documented cases I'm aware of. Let know want sources linked. Right?

For us fully vaccinated basically going motions masking purely ritual side-eying CDC like ""come on, get move make big announcement need keep personal measures already"" used sanitize hands time going out, anymore. Plus bottle well summer heat. Back one Olympics, ripped weight lifter image, maybe silhouette one, double quarter pounder box friend used joke gonna get strong eating them.

There've events (indoors outdoors) special conditions (requiring tests afterwards) try judge risks.

I sure meaningful way help beside donation, did. know isnt true Yes, people disproportionately infected. goes beyond behaviors.

Australia likely contract manufacturer (for one steps process).

also, trial used 21 day-interval, Chile shown, 28 interval doses makes effficacy go 50 60%+.

There still going people catch Covid foreseeable future, people see going get sick, people die.

The question is...is trade person learning depend acceptable. Good! Unfortunately, kids continue precautions before, get vaccinated. 

Young kids *can* get it, *can* spread it, seems like much. less risk adults, still risk.

Fortunately, cases starting drop (despite every variant here) vaccinated areas country. may urgent issue people think. Sorry contracted virus glad hear okay point. Get rest stay hydrated! export ban would mean *all* vaccine exports would banned.

They not.  Agreed. point pure exceptionalism nonsense it'll backfire badly leads variants globally.

This trickery. need trick people REAL, honest studies showing vaccines work incredibly well. Here‚Äôs basically whole thing:

‚ÄúThe Cleveland Clinic Tuesday released study showing 99.75% patients hospitalized COVID-19 Jan. 1 April 13 fully vaccinated, according data provided Axios.

Why matters: Real-world evidence continues show coronavirus vaccines effective keeping people dying hospitals. Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines found 95% 94% effective, respectively, preventing symptomatic infections.

Details: study also looked 47,000 Cleveland Clinic employees received one shot, shots shots all.

The Cleveland Clinic found 99.7% employees infected coronavirus vaccinated, 0.3% infections occurred fully vaccinated.
The study found group, mRNA vaccines 96% effective protecting coronavirus infections‚Äù Googled, seems may specific counties risk based low vax rates hospitalization metrics? rollback, lockdown, specific counties get sorted. 99.75% survived. something proud of. Completely agreed, think rate decay suggesting optimistic. cases *do* rise, especially south, reaction be? calls continue emergency declarations? many dead people worth? becoming fully vaccinated takes 5-6 weeks. becoming hospitalized covid generally takes week two. 

to fully vaccinated hospitalized covid early January, person would get first dose early November, authorization vaccine. 

This misleading garbage. great studies showing vaccines work incredibly well. need lie people crap like this. stumbled EVERY hurdle completely misinformed public initial stages outbreak! 

Preventable world acted proactively... fucked us act late. hope lessons learned documented least, ready future generations ignore well. Yup wearing mask anymore since I‚Äôm vaccinated  might opposed Japan raced vaccinate everyone olympics held, far know. Last read something like 70 million doses stockpiled. What? give good answer? wear mask still becuase cannot tell someone vaccinated looking them. That's CDC required that's using logic. need study this? common sense. actually funds kind bs.  India even one whole year, govt plan tackle 2nd wave Lol, hard compete w double double poutine Gotta wonder 0.3% infected. AFAIK, vast overwhelming majority breakthrough cases people already weak immune systems (e.g. cancer AIDS patients).

My doctor treats everything healthy dose skepticism get antibody test 3 weeks vaccine since 7 patients (at time) hadn‚Äôt immune response, shit high doesn‚Äôt even get score result, anything ‚Äú1.00‚Äù positive). Good, require meningitis require covid. aren‚Äôt wrong however, world doesn‚Äôt operate vacuum either. hear you. I‚Äôm ready get back normal. it‚Äôs probably similar rate. don‚Äôt stats back up, it‚Äôs clear atleast it‚Äôs class thing Hindus believe reincarnation. believe quickest way release soul help reincarnation process burn body. Japan invested billions Olympics understand feel way. 

However unless keep things control pretty dangerous carry seems like lose-lose situation Japan. think dam might breaking... check article bunch top experts predict indoor masking guidelines July 4th degree. misleading garbage. 

There good studies done show vaccines work incredibly well. Using trickery helps anti-vaxxers. Well wasnt preventable U.S. fucking stupid here. needs happen fast context stopping pandemics. mention extreme division handle pandemic, seen US every day since late January. How? excuse california. get paid time vaccine side effects. It‚Äôs law employer doesn‚Äôt allow held liable.  Yeah initial mask response fucking stupid. anyone remembers, lot bullshit how, ""we need save face masks healthcare workers"" time, healthcare workers told, ""masks dont really work get saturated quickly effectiveness goes people touch mask much"". huge shortage PPE dismantled pandemic response team thought waste money. children COVID-19 mild symptoms symptoms all. However, children get severely ill COVID-19. might require hospitalization, intensive care, ventilator help breathe. rare cases, might study cohort 20,714 pediatric COVID-19 patients U.S., 11.7 percent hospitalized, according research published April 9 Jama Network Open. roll dice this. one ever got hurt underestimating danger virus. fully vaccinated 1/1/2021, get vaccine 5-6 weeks prior that. 

So, mid-November. 

To hospitalized getting fully vaccinated...that take another week two. 

At point, someone fully vaccinated hospitalized COVID, would get first dose early November, prior vaccines authorized emergency use. people getting vaccine traditional anti-vaxxers. They're people get influenza shot prompted (but going way it), they're people issues taking kids get vaccinated school-required vaccines, they'll go get DTaP shot sister-in-law tells need get see new baby niece jam nail hand doctor sees behind it.

We need use term ""vaccine hesitant"" approaches need take differ handle true anti-vaxxers. I'm sure question asking. people post internet forums? share views discuss items interest others similarly interested. whole thing internet forums? Ask governor. said based science facts, moving back phase 2. dont understand. lockdown Every state easing lifted restrictions except WV WA. live top 5 strictest states like said went Disneyland.  That's incorrect. approved yesterday.

Yeah. might vaccinated know 2 people vaccinated 0 antibodies even 2 weeks second shot. That's everyone quantitive test determine exactly immune are. one issue I‚Äôm hearing farm animals catching covid mutating. happened mink killed tens millions mink result banned mink farming. billions farm animals something similar happens chickens cows mutation could happen even fully vaccinated human population. cant even begin talking wife vaccine. convinced theyre putting nano robots em... sigh

Does anyone know garbage come from? Facebook? That‚Äôs irrelevant. pfizer won‚Äôt die mass shooting either, that‚Äôs good say too!! teeth chattering mean future reference, ""commission"" means someone else paid something. Sounds like reading bunch thoughts mine. *clear* good reason distrust medicine generally. make excuse it. understand someone would afraid/hesitant still criticize fail to.

EDIT: need aware distrust system want encourage people what's needed fix issue future. putting personal failings answer. Fact: town (supposedly) covid hotspot hospitals empty I've known nobody covid since started.

Sure, say possible chinese government might tried supress information guarantee American government fully informed. could stopped travel, everyone mask up, blah blah blah, didnt happen. Now, need move on, better prepared next time. ""we"", mean us individuals, know politicians suck trying figure whats best people.  start vaccinating December

To fully vaccinated hospitalized beginning January, person would get first dose early November... even authorized emergency use.

5-6 weeks first dose fully vaccinated, even contracted virus first day fully vaccinated, tends take week two weeks become hospitalized. already clinic weekend kids middle school. unaware norovirus vaccine. yes, think three tests need done make sure first one false positive. conflict instance, conflict. Point blank, comply. part said true?
I Ireland familiar commissions inquiries used defuse issues  Wtf stop removing comments want swear let least let see even swearing see people saying None metrics mean much aren‚Äôt counted accurately. Good example people bit able afford wood cremation bodies dump else means cremations U.K. wanted totally ignore virus outset? great argument. US exporting .7 percent vaccines.

Europe catching American vaccination rates exporting 50 percent vaccines. China exporting 50 percent vaccines.

It's even ballpark. made believe ""Democracy"" contain virus, Communism can't. locked China, Europe. people frustrate ones legitimate reasons can't get mass vaccination site - people insist waiting weeks get appt personal doctor instead going mass site. everyone this, would take us years get everyone. Wrong. virtually every nation earth. We've detected 49. time variant discovered chances everywhere. time, transmission thought droplets aerosols, fomites (surface spread) significant concern. Besides mask supply concern, also concerned mask wearing would include user error people would touch surfaces touch masks, therefore applying virus directly line respiration. thought better people lockdowns much possible figured move forward.

Unfortunately, focus surfaces rather indoor air resolved many countries yet. focus droplets aerosols, [deep attached subject. 

I hope bring focus need **do now** much countries feeling relief vaccination programs, pandemic far risks remain contained poorer countries, especially vaccine reluctance misinformation. 

First, get word [social distancing indoor mildly effective [because cloth masks masks gaps used spaces. needs understood mitigations need implemented indoor spaces, especially workplaces cannot remote schools.

Simultaneously, get vaccines distributed quickly possible countries without programs however done. means removing patent protections fear lack infrastructure oversight, remove barriers safely possible. means richer countries foot bill, make happen. all-at-once hands deck moment. learn initial response delay one minute today. Vaccine approval children enough vaccine uptake among others push mild endemic issue. needed prioritize vaccination push hard possible. understand plan back looked like 2020 Olympics would happen, locked fallacy safe Olympics using masks, distancing, etc. money time invested poorly. federal government create system, would hope state governments ban use.

Well 1) feds 2) Supremacy Clause (Article VI Clause 2) says federal law, Constitution, treaties made authoritt, take priority supreme state law. conflict, federal law reigns supreme. though? Watch behold humans anchors shit Probably fucked rest life least got Keep smile face UK plunges lockdown America reopens Considering folks think vaccinated people ""shed"" mRNA hurt non-vaccinated people, we're generally screwed.

Covid test run pandemic. deadly, level previous illnesses. something scale Spanish Flu blow earth, we'll tragedy never seen before. people can't think, can't logically process things, uninformed, blindly follow idiot leaders, simply freaking listen experts.  Yeah, recommend still wearing masks socially distancing people vaccinated.

If got shots want movie night vaccinated friends? Full steam ahead. want go movie theater? Maybe wear mask sit seats people (shouldn't hard, theaters still pretty empty). family got vaccinated cause 45+. cousins unable cause enough vaccines 18-45 category. 
There one Pvt hospital selling limited stock home state almost every day checking vaccine website.

I moved previous red zone(Mumbai working) last year home state highest +vity rate country(Goa).

Fully planning riding right now. nothing rather mask up, wear disposable gloves grocery shopping sanitizing hands home.

Its sad shit, gotta eat food served you. Elect incompetent politicians, get incompetent services. 

Desperation? Yes.

Fuck guys power. time, monetary resources. healthcare taxed citizens deserve? get best service paying hugh prices private hospitals. people India, right left, deserve much better incompetence witnessing. read since law FL, Norwegian Cruises departing ships Florida. look forward cruising want cruise line take precautions, glad that. see correct. ""Near-full"" almost much protection get second dose. Thanks explanation. wondering well. read article, businesses Tuesday's executive order also explicitly prevents ""any local government, state agency, state employee, political subdivision state"" requiring residents provide proof vaccination status.

It's banned government entities. Nah, set kinds standards. 1000 cases day may literally never happen. COVID threat large portions population vaccinated, particularly vulnerable. need hit tiny case-counts pandemic end.

This kind talk creates false perceptions threat COVID-19 poses. Tell people downvoting me. False. Polio, measles, vaccines prevent illness. mRNA Covid basically prevents illness. J&amp;J may not. understand. report says Chinese detected identified new virus promptly emerged end 2019 gave warnings heeded. 
‚ÄúWhen look back period late December, 2019, clinicians Wuhan acted quickly recognised individuals cluster pneumonia cases normal,‚Äù said Sirleaf.

That's bit rich, considering much China suppressed news.

Four days later summoned Public Security Bureau told sign letter. letter accused ""making false comments"" ""severely disturbed social order"".

 
He one eight people police said investigated ""spreading rumours"" Local authorities later apologised Dr Li.

This December 30!! Sirleaf describes ""clinicians Wuhan acted quickly"" late December. Come on!  look back hundred years find exact thing happened back then. Around one two thirds people even believe pandemic existed many years later. like think evolved part human behavior changed since 1918-1919.

It's likely happen 2120. everyone alive today dead then. key thing epidemiological - pandemic caused/exacerbated human behavior. along we've using mathematical models disease spread part people intentionally spreading disease one way another, point.

I mean science medical instantly ignored and/or demonized many countries covid broke out. Fuck Putin Russia handled pandemic far better US, India, Brazil.

The competent authoritarian vs. moron squad guess. drink, Kimi. noticed much tightness chest lately. anxiety levels dropped back normal think.

Nothing like chest tightness respiratory pandemic causes chest tightness breathing issues symptom. caffeine triggered panic attacks realized much anxiety. Thank goodness Europe, they'd spend rest life working pay bill! Sure, businesses demand patrons vaccinated. infrastructure going use verify that?

I want government creating, providing information, otherwise involving themsevles creation sort walking papers. Digital otherwise.

If federal government create system, would hope state governments ban use.  federal many state governments allowing, almost encouraging, conditions viral spread

You're saying world grateful America incompetence containing spread pandemic nationally? Interesting perspective.  kinda feel like.. given Reddit knew everything preventing covid know today.. year ago.. there's sort proof magical rational actor necessarily exist, fully one third adults bad humans, something. Anyway there's lesson learned civic responsibility motivate Americans, thought/language leader world discourse unfortunately means stupid arguments infect everyone else.

Also really... place blame accuracy's sake.. really think sort immensely successful Russian disinformation/influencer campaign destroy West. This. Right here, happen. Antigen looking virus itself. PCR looks fragments virus. Antibody tests look previous infection vaccination (and requires blood draw).

Rapid testing antigen testing. Korea, Singapore, Vietnam nationalistic well pandemic, Western European countries general badly.

These shitty Holywood movies fucking reality simulations. EXACTLY like that. Well catch-22: could stopped pandemic, would required level authoritarian control people every end political spectrum would bristle at.

On paper, possible isolate kind control specific situations call it, like, say, global goddamm pandemic. know government never operates reality like paper, risk granting far-reaching powers governmental systems right potentially far, far greater threat. 

Imagine governments could really trust use power responsibly isolation. world could be. far I‚Äôm concerned that‚Äôs lot words say ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. left part off: investigation ongoing.

Oh studies suggest preventive measures mask use social distancing continue important vaccine implementation.  really bad thing celebrate first day year one died state official data? there's [plenty refuse acknowledge.

Apology accepted.

Stay woke tho.  Spherical cows. Yeah know man. basically saying PTSD WW2 name countries involved (another frequent late night show question person sits thinks minute mumbles France that's come with). Almost, need account percentage population vaccinated. intuitive compare similarly sized populations.

So, 100 100,000 unvaccinated people get sick within certain timeframe compared 10 100,000 vaccinated one shot, protection roughly 90%, 10 times less often.

If 1 case 100,000 people got 2 shots, makes 99% protection compared unvaccinated (100 cases) 90% compared first shot (10 cases). one SARS also helped Ebola outbreaks. World renowned experts working across multiple countries partners goal prevention mind. Guess disbanded year pandemic? Didn‚Äôt team ground China watch thing disbanded? Conflicting feelings this.

It's good underline learn mistakes, avoid future.

But still feel like slapping people face, considering much pain suffering world gone last year. bears much blame allowing pandemic become global. initial reports releases parroted CCP telling say - human human transmission virus possible. Perhaps telling world Wuhan break big deal world would've initially taken much seriously. US Brazil may screwed response (then again, look majority western world point, countries similar deaths infections per capita. Locking gets far unless isolated), atleast blatantly underreporting figures like Russia India. Russia even admitted underreporting factor less 3x back Fall, yet official figures never changed. Worldometer projection calculations put true numbers russia 5-6x underreported completely agree. critical mass student population vaccinated. Reported misinformation.

Think FEMA response New Orleans Puerto Rico. can't even solve that, think got time next pandemic? hope (be worse way not) time comes us elect new government, forget govt handled stuff. Cuz ppl who'd prolly forget terrible situation we're facing rn still support Modi BJP.... 

(Don't know made sense basically govt deserves second chance) Proven science normally involves published papers sources. those? Otherwise, spreading misinformation. introduced exactly saying un necessary  Even kill, leave serious health issues. Yeah, don‚Äôt know either. history vaccines almost side effects seen within months, layman know that? Also, false narrative autism link, utterly debunked, pushed hard core antivax groups. level it‚Äôs repeated enough might give credibility don‚Äôt dig details - live world fear, uncertainty, doubt - might make suspicious much science actually knows right now.  Reading Albert Camus's *The Plague* eerie apt read, especially considering written 70 years ago.   Note ""could"" means ""might"" means ""we know"" means ""might not"" means eventually something tell this, today. Today we're selling clicks need eat.

There initial period weeks China tried somewhat succeeded hiding it. December 31, 2019, made international news, January 13, 2020, case Thailand. January 23, 2020, China started construction emergency Wuhan, live stream construction 18 million concurrent viewers.

So, cat bag pretty quickly, yet governments world still take seriously obvious stuff done. missing ""/s""?

But either way wish sister speedy recovery. Washington. Everyone masks fine, too. United States like bunch little countries bunched together. like way someone like Trump can't mandate dumb thing. 

No state badly France Italy they're decidedly first world. yes! people forgetting act getting shot! Wonder many anti vaxxers made first appointment...

iTs FlU.

Lolllll
The China threatened clinicians silence? China didn‚Äôt shut travel beyond borders? preventable China acted. Let's honest here...there way stop whole mess.  started right Obama took office me. Still believe hate right. simply boggles mind.  dam already broke places. What's happening institutions slowly updating guidelines match average person anyway. Doug Ford much better. Good thing PM, we'd screwed.   Ya definitive within year so, would take couple years that. you‚Äôve made far without catching COVID, COVID beat it, may feel strong incentive get shot. know someone infant breathing issues thinks isn‚Äôt point getting vaccine could still spread COVID kid. Part issue hasn‚Äôt communicated vaccines stop spreading virus, evidenced CDC guidelines. Fauci went TV said there‚Äôs lot evidence suggesting vaccinated people don‚Äôt transmit, he‚Äôd probably get vaccinated. 

I also cousin fell conspiracy hole TikTok doesn‚Äôt think vaccines good you, told family members get it. listened her, didn‚Äôt. family left-leaning, gone college. There‚Äôs sorts reasons people haven‚Äôt gotten shot. NYT story good, think big part issue poor messaging power misinformation Yes, isn‚Äôt common either among young adults. thing. Well, DAH! 

Next time remember bend China (CCP) assume beginning situation 100 times worst telling you.

It's 101 dealing dictatorship. hope world remembers gave everyone Wuhan virus. should. People told stay home travelled infected country, listened. don‚Äôt dispute findings, I‚Äôm little skeptical report commissioned concludes needs given far money power. would US government suspend travel specifically telling countries suspend flights humans disgusting.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* high vaccination rates

Which would exactly? state highest vaccination rates Maine 46%. high. might localities higher, unlikely would considered ""high.""

""Planning"" worth much. one wants put back wall make promises something changes. fairly normal behavior. want promise masks hope cases drop vaccinations cone re-asses re-implement safety measures.

Once actually get high vaccination rates low case counts, start saying that. yet. Interesting [post risks/potential downsides granting emergency use authorization kids. redditors half good finding solutions ways implement finding problems using excuses things get done, imagine good website would be. I‚Äôm thinking like 5-10 years lol...   month past shot #2, pleased report anxiety going world ""normal"" things totally dissipated. stuck stringently COVID guidelines entire time, concerned I'd adjust going back world vaccinated. 

Don't get wrong, I'm still go crowded bar Friday night, pre-pandemic either. I've gone eat - outdoors indoors - times count now. flew see in-laws. I've gone stores (obviously still masked per requirements) without feeling like need quickly get get out. I've gotten hair done. 

I still getting groceries delivered (or curbside pickup), that's longer COVID thing much convenience thing. I've gotten used aspect things plain want go back, least right now. 

It feels wonderful. Thank you, science! Something I've noticed since post-vax, us hanging acutely aware we're standing.

Roommate friend first 2 hours stood opposite ends room talking, approaching all.

The day sister came drop something came inside thing happened, everyone staying far apart possible.

I think feeling going shared lot people gonna take time everyone relax Ha! meant almost dickmcfartjuiced pants! Kids! flu really fucking rough kids, primary vector spreading.

If kept schools closed winter, ditched every restriction (masking, distancing, lockdowns, etc.) would see flu cases another historic low. working parent two young kids...yeah hard find two free hours course months sometimes.

We also aren‚Äôt low income anything. It‚Äôs really hard sometimes find time anything, even getting vaccinated COVID. Thus played well. ""We're 100% long covid exists long term anyway"". No, know, take seriously wait influx people can't work long term affected long covid. saying findings bit...premature?  would banned flights country. leave, you‚Äôre allowed come back. Period. 

Instead people flying China wonder disease got here.  worse many people voted re-elect him. funny thing that, apparently, anti-mask anti-lockdown people Spanish Flu. totally see grandkids' generation thing Despite slow vaccine roll Germany decisively done better us nearly every metric despite cover multitude countries basically collapsed. important paragraph
""no one died fully vaccinated nearly needing treatment severe critical cases unvaccinated.""

It would good know ill vaccinated people think people would actually take political leadership *more* seriously scientists doctors. 

It turned politician could suggest random cures saw memes make fun masks people would trust than, say, every health organization planet basic common sense.

At least America, 35-45% country painfully stupid give shit anyone else themselves. terrifying year. Careful, echo chamber reddit. cancerous place.  obvious even read comments lmao. never said got full protection. Also, immunity absolutely imply can't catch covid. means immune protection it. followup dozens studies last year already showed Covid impact reproductive health effects cardiovascular system. much hate T***p, right withdraw WHO. absolute joke It‚Äôs Chinas fault lying covering We're finally getting top thankfully much pay left step 3.5:

So much time passed people bring effectiveness vaccines question attribute increase identification spectrum disorders Covid vaccine, waylaying future plans rollout vaccine efficiently. close think fully vaccinated number get 1st shot number progresses done? remember seeing reports people missing 2nd shot back never looked enough know talking large segment people. Since ever shortage stupid people? defeating argument September announcement? Schools problem test. test clearly see problem. Michigan forced student athletes test lo behold saw students testing positive wazoo, higher rate general population last spike.

I'm tired narrative schools never issue. public large honestly give fuck wanted schools open come hell high water, without even realizing student sick even required get COVID test come back school. NJ's 7-day average cases 1000! 2 weeks ago, nearly 2500. looking forward near-normal summer year! individual countries I'd agree you. international airports get thousands arrivals world every day. US near 100% uptake vaccines would still okay. seem cards.

Current 1+ shot status 46% population vaccine stocks returned. Kids coming line improve numbers accordingly. given kooks political extremists country think always significant susceptible population. Add foreign visitation think adds low unstoppable ongoing infection quite time. personally know one gotten mumps measles. hope right Covid fall status. doubts -- especially time soon. cdc says keep mask avoid people Mother‚Äôs Day 2022 :( Literally everyone sympthomatic covid gets shortness breath. Happened second infection well lmao confused, trolling. Seychelles interesting case study non-mRNA vaccines enough protect population outbreaks. Even Seychelles' ""good"" vaccine given older people AstraZeneca.

I think jury's still out, since people getting infected far unvaccinated. Thankfully symptoms nominal we‚Äôre thinking vaccination helped that. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs supposed doesn‚Äôt prevent getting help fight better. Yes, approved Monday. That's legal hurdle. Remember CDC advisory commitee advisory, impact anything. committee say whether recommend states start offering immediately wait. Everyone knows answer yes, started immediately.

But even definite yes, states could've ignored advice. usually look CDC guidance, to. long medically approved, offer it. Especially supply problem, there's point waiting. need willing arms. linked current clusters atm. came tested routine testing. never covered anything up. pandemic widely reported public soon China admitted something going on. matter anyway, one effect vaccine lasts longer weeks : immunity nothing left vaccine week two, there's nothing cause side effects.* 

I see argument much, including self-described health agencies, really flabbergasts counter basic principles toxicology. Yes, drugs act toxins cause damage within body lingers gone. damage form slow-developing syndromes. advanced example side effect vaccine approved use US, show within four months, show 6 months, 0.01% vaccinated. 

Of vaccines, much asking exists due historically severe standards safety. similar, Rotashield Lymerix, pulled market link, mechanism, rate published. Now, question unfortunately disingenuous implies safety profiles must identical different classes drugs, i.e. classical vaccines mRNA vaccines, absurd surface. Different drugs cause different effects, different mechanisms, regardless end result. forced start mostly blank slate evaluate new class drugs novel mechanism action.

Now, marketed drugs, plenty examples. thing actually want timing syndrome instead become scientifically apparent. Belviq, novel psychiatric weight loss drug, market 8 years quietly pulled 2020 link cancer. far know mechanism known, real data nonetheless led decision. know long fenfluramine market pulled causing valvulopathy? not, disturb you. Decades. targets mechanisms thought extremely safe weren't. happen again, guaranteed. tried enroll kids live 10 minutes site they‚Äôre short supply Wow hope people see this. hard argue CDC website! read article saying Florida approved sometime today, 14 year old nephew keeps asking it‚Äôs yet get appointment. Really excited week! Except full ban. still allowed people back China U.S. citizens.   months covering up? year ago now.  first thought discharge hospital patient ""Wow, that's going ruin person financially,"" made aware that's works anywhere else developed world. Yes, country obviously take responsibility citizens isolate Wuhan. travel bans China effective. refuse soil. Add 12-17 year olds could close 60% (probably 58ish%) overall. UN called travel ban world‚Äôs factory would deteriorated reputation UN world, especially China. It‚Äôs clear didn‚Äôt call measures. case me. Took nap gone woke up. second Moderna shot, felt like mild case flu day. Mostly fatigue fever.

Not big deal all, really, especially knew exactly was, knew actually sick, knew would day. used excuse crash couch watch movies day sipping bowl tofu soup.

Even arm soreness gone little day later. hurricane New Orleans recently Katrina local state governments changed nothing. SARS 2003 H1N1 experience seem written threat Covid. Politics economics screw effective preparation, migitation responses threats. Approval process Pfizer. Full approval durability immunity past 6 months, data didn‚Äôt exist December. wrg,n osuch thing comeptanx may escaped lab, may bread backyard farm poor Chinese guy, may caught wild. gain knowing? Someone else blame maybe? COVID similar response.  Yeah, idea either, really want know.

The vaccine around long enough. months, enough people gotten infected despite getting vaccine, we'll know obvious year. think clinician is? doctor. They're talking local government.  Lowest since mid-October hospitalizations lowest since late October. stats coming vaccine opens 12-15 year olds, among biggest transmitters virus recently (makes sense considering havent vaxx'd yet). 50% adults fully vaxx'd, 70% least one dose, huge chunk population eligible ease access getting appointment.

Not countin eggs hatch (still done keep gotten us numbers stay low extended sustained period time) lookin pretty good us soon! Boston/MA would follow suite... kind hoping least gave date ease restrictions like dc va recently Make sense. supposed make OK? ""X place said thing!"" I've studied pharmacology/toxicology/medical science extensively entire adult life, also practiced healthcare. posted centrist places skeptic community broadly, yes, comes areas I'm knowledgeable in, thought could help conversation share thoughts own. Re-read original comment realize making statements safety vaccines themselves, instead frankly questionable toxicology thrown around lately. still early stage pharmacovigilance here, yet people broadly seem want get ahead literature asserting things certain way always way. longitudinal comparative studies 2-5 years gonna throw guys loop. fact, that's most-substantial way vaccines protect us, people focus direct protection.

this completely wrong lmao. vaccine protects completely death, almost completely severe illness, 95% even cold. Community spread cut say 10k cases day summer baseline around 40k reduces risk factor 4, vaccine alone reduces chance even cold factor 20, let alone basically preventing factor made covid pandemic first place severe illness/death. Sure, everyone vaccinated it'd obviously better there's good 20-30% country get it, there's going reservoir new cases. scenario, much safer one vaccinated even sea infected people precautions vaccinated 70% vaxxed masks/distancing considering aersol spread. clearly laid arguments, simply refuse accept restricting tiny amount exports full export ban.

I wouldnt worry it.  20 √ós kinda broke üò≥ homeless hungry can't pay medical bills! jokes, folks. I'm week ~~same every week, lockdowns fun~~ Ok California going get rid mask mandate state NC? see coming.  news, water wet 

china warned us january 2020 actually disagree. number deaths could mitigated there‚Äôs much stupid world pandemic prevented. Please love good world trust WHO. Research done recent decades technology around test shown majority deaths Spanish Flu caused virus itself, secondary bacterial infections took advantage weakened immune system lungs already damaged initial viral infection. 

With antibiotics antiviral drugs available today, morbidity 1918 H1N1 Spanish flu would likely comparable Covid thus far.

The main difference case Covid initial outbreaks Spanish flu quickly person would go seemingly healthy, discolored lack oxygen hard doctors tell white patient black patient, dead.. many cases death came within 24 hours first noticing symptoms. Whereas Covid tends take time initial infection, incubation, first symptoms, eventual hospitalization and/or death, increases strain medical system, allows virus time spread unexposed populations.  According CDC, risk hospitalization/death flu greater covid children, that's flu vaccine. going start arguing mask mandates flu, now? strong central government made public welfare infrastructure priority, could effective marshalling resources services, enforce mask wearing &amp; quarantines, corrupt, people would listen, could also simultaneously eradicate poverty, improve literacy rate.

~ like China's ~ 

But no, individual rights 1.3 billion indians outweigh overall welfare entire nation.

Gotta say, UKs divide conquer strategy worked well. Someone tell Mexico taking vaccines US made 51st state. Exactly. live modern world dependent vulnerable global economy. It‚Äôs need global regulations. really hope one day like United Nations Earth could actually authority whole planet prevent chaotic events like pandemic. early April, 8% people missed second number probably grow less-enthusiastic get doses. okay; one shot still provides substantial protection still help us end pandemic. 92% success rate pretty good. ""Shed mRNA"", excuse actual fuck? üôÉ still acted quickly. incubation period thing asymptomatic cases, plus fact novel virus, can't expect anyone know even existed much later. things considered, react pretty quickly. Good additions list! sad see article went nowhere tried schools outdoors (or windows open older buildings, always sealed/energy efficiency) possible surprised. think Obama administration Republicans also voted replenishing supplies like ventilators etc.  Hawaii)

MA VT also didn‚Äôt open adults 4/19, way.

Edit: local news source mentions it:  big country. Thousands likely exposed covid days. happy hear this! fear since work school we‚Äôll wearing forever... guess glad wear anywhere work. many times tested flu aren‚Äôt transmit symptoms. Covid transmitted symptoms. Need catch early. yeah situation weird seems US using form modern colonialism.

Have nice cake-day :-) That's rich coming people covered virus full year started spreading. Jealous. West Coast put vaccine advisory board together trust Trump might add extra day two us start. state board wants crack it. Washington state loves rolling around red tape.  CANNOT vaccinate, actual medical reasons... I'm sorry.

The best thing people get vaccinated, I'm tired people acting like there's magical solution problem. first time saw Contagion thought way Jude Law's character could exist. 

After events last year boy wrong.  California ending mask mandates, too, thread toxic one California positive? timing-related. need stop dumping people states want end mandates. Look covid long haulers debunked...it‚Äôs literally anecdotes people saying could run farther referring virus, illness. Let's punish asap, also get m4a soon possible. Nearly everything preventable hindsight. TIL: [Wikipedia - Collapse Atlantic northwest cod fishery] could smarter administration last year, could saved people. get coming (one person wearing mask crowd people) could make perfect sense case.

The photo compressed (telephoto/DOF), likely tables apart look. They're also outside.

The food server wearing mask. likely server go *inside* place receive food orders. Inside, likely workers wearing masks. pandemic, is. Everybody get vaccinated get past this, won't. ""Should"" meaningless word. behaving sole decision employees employers rational actors drop someone like rock minor inconvenience Yeah, decided go ahead add it. age breakdown hospitalizations also preexisting conditions?  already late end January, early January, one knew going yet. 

The thing would worked immediate, worldwide travel ban lockdown two weeks, called January...*no one would done it* Okay, perhaps great US sitting vaccines. make it? least supply vaccinate themselves, quickly. theory. great theory, somewhat discourage genome sequencing discover new variant treated poorly discoveries made. prime example works: Go youtube watch videos happened GM EV-1 car, read happened Th!nk car technology started become somewhat mature Big Auto managed convince various legislatures electric cars unviable. Th!nk operating daily little Norwegian village right frankly want one battery technology used coming end fear might impossible replace lifetime up.  They've underdelivered lot. government said ,it's health workers reported. 

Following WHOs recommendations along using China's test kits, PPE , contact tracing systems etc, yes Sinovac ,is country Brunei , COVID free full year .

And reports people dying vaccines. 

It's better stop listening conspiracy theories take vaccine supposed instead spreading lies misinformation anti-China anti-WHO , eventhough US 500k COVID deaths - literally highest world per capita - CDC made faulty test kits failed contain COVID.

Meanwhile test kits work guess China well. 

Meanwhile look US, give Indonesia supplies whatsoever ? vaccines, help ?

Pity bite hand cures. ONE likes wearing mask. 
I don‚Äôt like wear pants.
But still it. server working likely required wear mask. might want learn mask help goes inside working close quarters. Callous, much? 0.2% population? Name something else killed 0.2% population? could easily avoided simple, slightly discomforting measures? 

Covid third leading cause death US last year behind heart disease cancer so, much could prevented.

But specifically answer question. No, pandemic easily transmissible disease becomes common world-wide. global version epidemic. ones kill millions people make news, know, like Covid. kids magically disappear weekends?

Nope, took kids vaccination people two jobs?

They're going lose jobs trouble supporting kids catch severe case COVID. people without cars?

They take public transportation vaccination site. way get around without access information?

I even know means people reasons. autoimmune disease live alone. moved pandemic friends area. stay family next month, i'm getting shot case bad reaction. want deal disabled person. sh*t Pretty damn high. Look ‚ÄúCOVID long haulers‚Äù well percentages hospitalized patients permanent lung heart damage. It‚Äôs pretty bad. did. Wuhan! 

But something Obama administration did, Trump reflexively destroyed it. &amp; stimulus checks Newsom trying buy way recalled. looks like already fixed typo/error didn‚Äôt mRNA vaccines seem safer wouldn‚Äôt big deal, covid cases dropping US enough supply Pfizer Moderna makes sense cautious clots. lol source?? Asthma doesn‚Äôt make high risk COVID. findings suggest asthma prevalence among hospitalized COVID-19 appears similar population asthma prevalence significantly lower asthma prevalence among patients hospitalized influenza. ‚Äú  original argument early year. basically said wasn‚Äôt unrealistic Olympics could vaccinate people timely fashion. all, got 100,000 yen stimulus check Abe sometime May, long wait. Little know Japanese government slow. Although agree decision, can't help disappointed. 

Most folks age (30 yrs) going eat shit sandwich - prioritised almost end. plans done travel abroad see family probably drain months.

Given vaccine pass (which also support), becomes moral question: age group &amp; &lt;35) wait longer especially given *supposed* timeline giving vaccines &amp; &lt;25 summer holidays? understand school time, summer holidays, really? Update Advisory Committee Immunization Practices (ACIP) -- known polysorbate allergy longer contraindication (is precaution only) mRNA covid-19 vaccines Pfizer, moderna, , contraindication Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. I‚Äôm sure point you‚Äôre trying make here‚Ä¶all public health decisions made balancing risk. current infection rate Norway, countries access mRNA vaccine supply, harm would caused continued use AstraZeneca J&amp;J didn‚Äôt, aren‚Äôt going use them. It‚Äôs simple there‚Äôs exaggeration. said know yard support me, could help bit.

If 99% neighbors died off, nothing would really stop using yards, too. finding actual farm living owner. literally eat big Mac fry day fine portion things right. (Drink water, eat less later on) might health insurance US it‚Äôs usually tied one‚Äòs employment. record unemployment due the, know, pandemic. 

And parts US absolutely third world level. UN visited Alabama made determination American also acknowledge we‚Äôre first world country absolutely dropped ball. Luckily patient OP‚Äôs article he‚Äôs EU citizen. Yeah Finland wild. appears laxest approach education yet beat torture mill education systems places like China, Korea, India, etc. it? germ warfare china anyone realise needs help anger fueled propaganda machine genuine, wouldnt agree risk there, afraid? avoid disease might harm others haha Look Israel, 58% vaccinated (no kids) basically covid cases anymore. kids 100% safer hit point (we totally June 15th) prior mask mandate lifted Vaccines generally weight based, dose everyone, babies adults.  can‚Äôt wrap head around it. It‚Äôs hell. Well Pfizer known bringing dead things life.. shit Sherlock. read wiki link provided. family time. settings indoor -- massively large settings people around world, around country, convening, people mixing real dense spaces,"" Newsom replied. ""Otherwise, we'll make guidance recommendations, mandates restrictions businesses large small.""

So they're really getting rid depending setting. I'm sure schools still require masks businesses require masks want.

I'd like see say capacity limits. Here's thing. obviously talking something normal parameters testing. vaccines safe, throwing place. like used vaccines before. There's never ""shedding"" previously mRNA can't survive environment hardly length time. they're kept cold. 

So. Even somehow shed mRNA, would degrade quickly matter.  news, sky blue sun hot Recall Repooplican crapola. Kaitlin Jenner? asked Arnie come retirement. understand Japan extremely slow vaccination require every athlete coach fully vaccinated enter Japan become non issue ? need quarantine, keep mind vaccine takes work. significant amount protection 2 weeks first dose. 1 2 weeks second dose, considered 'fully vaccinated', vaccine reached maximum efficacy. Yes. would parents feeling statement? Alternatively employees fully vaccinated, need everyone wearing masks goes down. wtf love california cares reason is, want to, let them. zero effect life. China apologists amazing. literally arrested doctor warned it. issue teaching critical thinking kids, experts studying program find weaknesses loopholes. 

This ""humans stupid gullible."" people studied influence people reshape thinking, originally maintain control dictatorships, turned skills towards sabotage behest bosses.

Propaganda source lot troubles, sure protect it. Adults, believe Yes. doubt check Asia. Vaccines still working variants.  Lmfao, yeah shit. listened Taiwan instead giving China another rusty trombone. adverse reactions getting covid shot tetanus shot two weeks later? Really. come this? keep reading I‚Äôve got answer outside hubris thinking beaten virus. need that. 
The countries managed best limited freedoms populations. Populations refuse sacrifice freedoms movement economic growth suffer much can‚Äôt think critically. mask mandate go away 70% adult population fully vaxxed 70% PA's total population? cost pandemic goes far, far deeper ""99% survival rate.""

Even statistically high rate surviving virus, good rate survivors would needed hospital care may either needed oxygen treatment put ventilator. Hospitals become overwhelmed admissions situations virus allowed spread. would lower survival rate further, deny healthcare desperately need it.

Then there's economic cost. Globally, we've probably lost trillions GDP COVID. left hospitality industry shambles left many small business owners destitute. Granted, lockdowns put place control virus, lockdowns wholly effective people even entire nations follow suit.

What would alternative lock all? Care home industry would collapsed residents dying. Life insurance firms would gone bust sheer amount policies they'd pay out. housing market would gone freefall sheer amount now-empty homes sold relatives deceased COVID victims. pandemic potential kill tens, hundreds millions people, especially virus mutated something deadlier.

Even survive, recently determined COVID-19 vascular disease, respiratory one. understand long term symptoms like long-COVID little bit back February 2020. shit potential make people less productive long time.

And even get started mental health costs pandemic... Jesus Christ downvote BTW. understanding concern locals low vaccination rate point likely Olympics take place.   states trying tie vaccination coverage, I‚Äôm sure long they‚Äôll hold plans goals longer seem reachable. 
(One states Michigan, far active cases right California also stronger political pressure mandate) Speculation point. Wuhan CDC concluding study present WHO, required international law. Welp guess I'm anti-vaxxer even get shot. Personally, ready white boy summer. don‚Äôt know one truly ever ready white boy summer.   think Vietnam get front without vaccines? Maybe SoCal. Bay Area never got bad.   realize people love kids want hurt sick, right? risk straight dying low, people forced inconvenienced piece fabric months? kids die, cares? /s want move back Massachusetts. South Carolina Florida blow much. think looked (unless different state similar law), law almost never enforced and, cases was, charges always got dropped one reason another People reply things like ""Oh Children still complications"" excuse.

They right, mean valid reason continue masking. Children, Flu literally statistically worse COVID. open up, Flu chance gain foothold again, much dangerous people age 12 (remember 12 year olds get vaxxed Thursday!) COVID ever was. Also, 70% population vaccinated, probaby R0&lt;1 anyways UK Israel data anything go by.

No, need vaccinate children open up. WHO, people said u didn‚Äôt need wear masks already was. Sorry bunch fucking muppets glad didn‚Äôt take advice. Understandable. I'm people continuing wear long want. still mandate Virginia really thought ditching indoors yet. evidence certain people profited much simply providing less brainy fortunate people conspiracy theories could easily connect with. also social media works perfect echo-chamber people.  


Yes, politics play major role certain traits, certain mindsets moving specific direction takes feed whatever want hear good go. 


Though, read claims many countries education system made breed idiots. Someone push wheel bottom. attempts mandate vaccines, governmental level, use stores? Honestly asking. 

I assumed would get lumped laws mandating specific vaccines already. unvaccinated better get vaccinated like tomorrow. barriers gonna fall soon. Children school. Ehhh argument going hold less weight time goes on. 

As people get vaccinated, spread virus become less issue. kid get covid vaccinated adults house, keep kid home get 2 consecutive negative tests. Adults responsible wear masks go time. not. 

Either way spread covid keep going down, along threat unvaccinated individuals. absolutely correct.

It‚Äôs ridiculous comparison.

I threat anyone naked. 

But public maskless deadly pandemic 100 years could easily unknowingly infect someone fatal disease. 

Good point. üëç Yep - one thing states always 'bleeding edge' reopening guidelines, cautious governors reopen remove mandate, think rest hard-pressed keep real restrictions. That‚Äôs 1 4 statewide LA I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs higher. skyrocketed 3 million confirmed cases Texas still 1 million. freeways bumper bumper traffic thanksgiving Christmas despite warnings gather. Even governor ignoring guidelines eating restaurants. know plenty people caught COVID past winter. People gave 6 months ago. didn‚Äôt read article. It‚Äôs written well respected science writer comprehensive look origins covid. 

How got smear campaign weird. argument government mandating something would result decreasing frequency? 

Because every basic logic points opposite US pandemic response team. Trump disbanded it. Ok, people who've already got virus recovered, protected ones got vaccine? I'm asking really know. laughing ass off. Maybe you‚Äôre jolly jocular sort fellow laughing somebody asking question usually implies negative judgment. Didn‚Äôt give bad information begin influence China us uk followed Russian influence?  takes time! Next thing know you‚Äôll see retrospect like ‚Äúwow, mask thing month ago?‚Äù  True...but forget kids walking, talking vectors COVID. Exactly. one Taiwan immune, even naturally. Containment doesn‚Äôt mean shit nobody gets vaccinated. want parents get shot damn it! ready start complaining county keeps mandate.

County said they'll defer state restrictions 50% fully vaccinated. We'll see plays out. I'm coming blind California appears many deaths covid three times many cases despite 6x times population. control. 

Although, devil's advocate, might headline implying politics opposed ""the pandemic control"" Amen! Desantis absolute moron one besides called recall even taking seriously. Like others mentioned it‚Äôs big joke. lot people vote again. fairness, CDC lied us beginning prevent run masks. unforgivably wrong them, done, none us forget it. I'm busting. Boutta club MARYLAND DROPPING MASK MANDATE MEMORIAL DAY absolutely not... asked why. No. Go right ahead.

As today, ACIP said fine get day want. Even then, old guidance wait two weeks - fine even that. know, right? pathetic. worry fate Michigan Covid. New Zealand great job all, stop making poster child COVID mitigation like country world effective job? J&amp;J 66% effective, Moderna Pfizer 90-95%.  Thanks yes forgot /s! CDC guidelines updated 2 weeks ago, masks recommended unless large gathering (such sports venue). I'm sure states point outdoor mask mandates still place.

[Refer graphic created getting 66% from. CDC study showed MRNA vaccines 90% effective preventing infection. LOLing at? sound like idiot exchange. I‚Äôll follow science, follow made stuff Oh fucking god. time thought tunnels naturally made nature laptop computers grew fucking treeeees. I've known multiple people gotten COVID two weeks 2nd shot. hospital, vaccinated probably saved lives, sick. whole ""We're free clear!!!"" message little optimistic. true. someone wasn‚Äôt risk anyways, first shot brings risk wayyyyy down. Still protected 2 weeks post-second dose, you‚Äôre still pretty safe 1 Everyone forgets worst pandemic lifetimes. pandemic *still raging day*

The AIDS pandemic: 1981-present.
75.4 million infected
32.7 million died 

It took world 20 years began taking seriously. frankly, it‚Äôs due perception gay disease many people‚Äôs homophobia allowed fester.  Shore bars going nuts summer. Oh meant US general. don‚Äôt live state wildfire season idk people Riiiiiiiggggggghhhhhhhtttt.  Good thing I‚Äôm moving Chicago months. It‚Äôs kinda shame everyone know wanted make something leaves state. that‚Äôs left people seemingly ignorant can‚Äôt afford get out. Growing hated here. I‚Äôve back forth times life time I‚Äôm gone good. pride South Carolinian never will. Charleston really nice thing state. read article long back anti- vaccination. Turns difference republican democrat within error margin. Close 50/50. wait wildfire season ... think vector Covid-19 dangerous person loaded weapon?

Pretty sure misread comment saying opposite that. Congratulations, managed forcibly insert skin colour matter nothing whatsoever.  
Next time try eyesight, I'm sure work out.  forgot AIDS pandemic! could bite side. people would unhappy mask mandate anymore. bizarre comment would see reddit... implying white men monopoly sex? God bless nation. greatest powerful country world Yeah, that's exactly going for. Although, I've learned lot Spanish Flu conversations. thanks, folks.

Covid terrible failed keeping killing millions. next one could LOT worse. act towards like towards Covid, slaughter. nice also kinda weird seeing things like hit much faster expected. would worth take consideration traveling back 1918 almost fantasy large fraction population back then. Also, free-movement people today planes sliding across sky. 


Though, rest points outlined still stands, lack medication, proper equipment etc.  


I'd say covid-19 strong Spanish flu would seen far severe outcomes. USA update first dose shots:

65% (~173.2m people) - 88.89% way done

70% (~186.4m people)- 82.54% way done True Darwin  LOL, ok still people getting COVID dying even though vaxxed (albeit small percentage)? various reasons vaxxines 66-95% effective?

Why one 5% get it? understand works? Lol, well fucking shit. Ahem... countries. Statistically countries government sponsored health care.
Here India, either pay, they'll literally place outside hospital allocate bed someone pays Well, right there. know smarter well-studied people disagree me, I'm fine that. look data disagree conclusions, encourage anyone feels comfortable same. stated response frankly rude poster implied entire worldview based around blog-science. Umbrella Corp. Considering Biden right now, one helped Obama create permanent pandemic response team term together, think disingenuous argument. 

We one. great one. subsequent orange administration destroy saying ‚Äúif need always get back‚Äù. 

What need way next administration able destroy years worth work getting pandemic response team together. made decision regret it. son online last quarter last year. person school much better decision made. took precautions school make sure went well possible. online shopping much possible. eat restaurant year. take vacations. kept away grandparents. willing give things go school person full time. civic responsibility motivate Americans,

It actually tell government tells *patriotic* duty comply government fulfills end social contract. government instead makes show saying, ""We care crap neither you."", no, people motivated. need happen again. already happening _now_, fighting vaccines, inadequate response, supplies, politicking , finger pointing.

For stop happening atleast 70 percent active human population world need vaccinated, that's going happen year next.

Meanwhile God knows COVID like year two now. Take us SE East Asia, whose 2 3 SARS outbreak COVID latest . going get worse, accepting we've got COVID relatively unscathed compared west India. pandemic starts China (or wherever) government hides refuses disclose severity freely allowing travel, screwed.

The linked report directly disputes problem current report says Chinese detected identified new virus promptly emerged end 2019 gave warnings look back period late December, 2019, clinicians Wuhan acted quickly recognised individuals cluster pneumonia cases normal,‚Äù said alert sent Wuhan potentially new virus, ‚Äúpicked quickly neighbouring areas, countries, media ‚Äì online disease reporting site ‚Äì WHO,‚Äù said.

Instead, issues found policies governing preventing rapid action giving little power, fact countries squandered away ‚Äúthe lost month‚Äù February, otherwise ‚Äúdevalued debunked‚Äù science. many people actually work 7 days week 52 weeks year? Maybe schools could least ease absence requirements. pretty strict TX. Pre pandemic school culture go school unless fever/vomiting still happened. spreads flu diseases. schools seem proficient online school, maybe kid kinda sick work home. people get blood boiling. Misquoting taking lines context legitimate studies ""proof"" point. somebody misquoted papers interest, I'd fuming. saying CDC wrong. vaccine's 90% effective reducing infection quarantine come contact infected person vaccination? think qualified CDC make calls? disaster already happened , every health expert would known. little government could done

This simply untrue. knew danger, seen progress US / Italy / Brazil last year India well containing much time. decided act like rather continue containment efforts vaccine rolled out. India's leadership examples know would go horribly lifted restrictions without vaccine plan, chose anyway. Everyone knows you‚Äôre lying. stop.  I've already got students walking halls claiming wear masks anymore. Yeah. Let‚Äôs trust China. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs got 99% survival rate.‚Äù

/s

This reason enough right survival rate shitty argument. China responsibility ACTIVELY HIDE IT. government answers handle short locking people homes two months. People US knew much government beginning. Pretending otherwise absurd. literally non-stop media coverage first cases confirmed. I'm living lockdowns lasting year every five years. curious. reason breakthrough cases needs hospitalization? Low immunity? Whoops sorry. I'm glad here. looking wrong, that's fine, energy explain understandable fashion. vaccine either neutralizing antibodies don't. 5% chance catching covid, zero percent chance right now. 5 people hundred still catch it. I'm 5. 

Also, I'm talking payout time machines. that's talking about, comparing whether I'd catch covid would comparing two different things. I'm talking odds winning walking slot, winning put one particular pull.

Your analogy bad anti-science anti-vax here. pandemic took mother general appreciation humankind. 
When late teens used edgy misanthrope. grew started appreciate people. past year grew more, despise stupidity arrogance, became obvious events. awful treating can't even give *yourself* day get shot? No, doesn‚Äôt. also medications decrease immune response, autoimmune disorders. Wealth health end day ok.  depends. I‚Äôm inclined agree u/Krampus1313 insofar it‚Äôs likely drop ‚Äì people likely weak immune response vaccine also among first eligible (because pre-existing conditions made much, much vulnerable).

I wouldn‚Äôt surprised there‚Äôs little/no data back right now, imagine amount of: cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy; AIDS patients; HIV patients progressing towards AIDS; transplant recipients immune suppressants; etc. *also* unvaccinated sits much smaller ratio vs. similar conditions vaccinated, compared ‚Äúnormal‚Äù population. people risk *any* disease, generally understand importance getting vaccinated ASAP, hope getting immune response.

Therefore, overall population getting vaccinated continue increase, whereas subpopulation ‚Äúweak immune system, vaccinated‚Äù won‚Äôt increase comparable rate, thus ‚Äúbreakthrough infections‚Äù inevitably shrink % vaccinations. Arguing add new mask mandates arguing keep existing mandates place. would support flu mask mandates though. would huge public health benefit basically cost. I'm saying they're 66-95% effective. best 1/20 chance contracting covid, worst, 1/3. I'd quarantining shitting pants, less two weeks. Hey, likely die, though. hurry get back bleak world. option country AZ (which actually becoming ""alright"" with... wanted Pfizer), travel somewhere get second dose distributing Pfizer. 

Would loved mix matching... think I'll wait professional results get second AZ dose. aware Netherlands US? started right Obama took office me.

Hell. know people never voted day lives, never even cared one bit politics government Obama ballot people freaked fuck get polls fast enough. That's noticed shitty people are.  that, even evil. intentionally tried let run rampant certain states political party reps states part of. wanted kill many people possible areas.

They literally trying murder citizens US intentional inaction. 20-50 year another 2 pandemics likely. live little blue Petri dish it‚Äôs getting hotter. could lottery, says another report. chances COVID 'take 3.5 months life you'? chances serious side effects months after? Good, needed fresh supply arms since many people 16+ slow uptake. work yourself, tyrant boss. already put ""fully vaccinated"" flair rather wait full two weeks? Maybe flair right now, then. Much world going end two vaccines. seen anything least bit definitive that; answer probably waiting trial results. No, said masks work care introverted want people things want do, want people forcing things want either. want people honest themselves; want go drinking friends, want go family dinner, say NO. owe people explanation, stick yourself. 

But tell need stopped going out, despite fully vaccinated, I'm bad person missing around people. No. already Italy. Stupid report. It‚Äôs type vaccine used.  seems like genuine anger, rather anger sake angry Probably shut due ""unviable."" (Read: threat profit margins) believe summer vacation (in southern US least) initially implemented children could help parents summer harvest, correct? thing is, matter doesnt do, recall always gonna hang background, attribution gonna happen matter Yah maybe preventable would clairvoyant maybe. dont bootlick corporations push m4a? absolutely would take ‚Äúyears‚Äù get vaccines community health centers personal doctor‚Äôs offices, fact wouldn‚Äôt take much time all, trust administration it. know much vaccine is?

An alternative approach getting quick dopamine fix judging people feel comfortable getting vaccine would to, know, get vaccine there? Unless priority feeling morally superior them. Here‚Äôs possible solution maybe I‚Äôm simplifying much. could bring kids vaccination site. fun thing weekend it. get vaccinated you‚Äôre less likely infect children get sick could mean it‚Äôs hard take care kids quite awhile even worse. Human stupidity not. allied religious zealout 1980ies - get enough votes Reagan could win. idea was, think, stayed way were, god votes, religous people took over?

In 2000 election already dark side seen European perspective. clear care legitimate winner, wanted declared win 11 stroke luck neoconservatives. Without terrorist attacks resulting national focus Kerry wins landslide neoconservative movement crushed.

Yeah think well. Canada SARS 2003 still dropped ball. hehe im danger blame.  Well starters, quoting much smaller number people fully vaccinated? use 1 doses? article making changes next school year fall. That's plenty time get second dose. Yeah, situation much changed CA places dropping masks entirely next month; yet, single update state. waiting for? Either going open well behind everyone else planning giving businesses time prepare opening. really stupid given amazing work done citizens MA. get concern people vaccinated probably stop spread better masks ever could (read private settings). Also, indian variant still neutralized vaccine Hep C shaves 15 years infected even know it. pandemic pat worse United States Spanish Flu. Boom World failed curb it, mysterious surge pneumonia new virus - nothing see here.

start checking peoples temperatures prior flights - lets take aspirin getting on

Then splash masks work sprinkle even need vaccine. Oh sorry. I'm little defensive commenting subreddit haha. problem reopening timeline solid fact based reasoning. seems like caution sake caution. kind tired CDC dragging feet everything.

Yep, think lot states too, thank god. politicians bloody listened scientists. hope world learned mistake I‚Äôm optimistic chance adopt me. cook. skills lie technology obsolete, I‚Äôm fast learner. right, strictly speaking. Unless N95 N99, properly fitted, easily 'get through' - want us buying masks. population-level effect surgical masks 'face coverings' actually remains unproven. probably make important differing reducing transmission limiting amount droplets, but, amazingly, there's little scientific evidence assesses population level, factoring sort mask, people wear them, behave (lack distancing, likely leave house etc etc). really complex issue. ""the vaccines make dick bigger"" followed disclaimer saying preventing getting whiskey dick Right, variant (and several others) already seeded elsewhere. /s announced Uber Lyft giving free rides vaccination spots.
