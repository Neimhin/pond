An 80% vax rate sounds great paper, especially compared cities/states, Bay Area around 8 million people… say 20% unvaccinated, that’s still 1.6 million people. 

Last year Bay Area hospitals also taking patients SoCal hospitals overwhelmed. doesn’t depend local vax/case/hospitalization rates, unfortunately. beginning stages trending yet again. Hopefully places rigorous vetting applications exemption. Medical exemptions exceedingly rare. don’t know much religious exemptions, would hope demonstrate something beyond saying it’s religion. He's wrong side everything else. He's truly despicable human being.  Even though family vaccinated, that's we've operated beginning. never stopped masking even CDC relaxed guidelines; dropped cloth then, 3-4 weeks ago started wearing KN95s cloth ones again. 

We might die Covid, family members vaccinated yet still vulnerable illness, trying prevent breakthrough infection us priority.

(My mom 86 COPD get pneumonia normal cold. niece genetic metabolic disorder gets sick, blood chemistry gets messed acidic starts damaging organs [brain, too], plus kidney liver transplant couple years ago immunosuppressive drugs.) board review Less credit, Rubio bypassed front-line workers get vaccine caused massive backlash them. Hey get covid need vaccine? currently covid case far minor hopefully remains way. wondering need get vaccine afterwards? already antibodies actually covid right? Actually, Title 38 covers certain VA medical staff, nearly them. example, RNs covered, LPNs. time, implementation restricted Title 38, Title 38 Hybrids would cover staff, LPNs.  And, I've yet see case medical religious exemption reviewed board. requirement prove religious belief, statement ""deeply held religious belief"" preventing vaccination. State writing supervisor, sign, return OH good go.  Yeah. can't believe they're sending military shoot people.

Oh wait... hate Graham knock homophobia Good luck. really hope best us all. virus never going away vaccine mandate, removing mask mandate worse better removing future? You’re getting “mask big deal, suck wear theme forever” territory. Actually, Title 38 covers certain VA medical staff, nearly them. example, RNs covered, LPNs. time, implementation restricted Title 38, Title 38 Hybrids would cover staff, LPNs.

Taco Bell one place thst needs dine in. many items need eaten ASAP way messy eat car can't kill virus. widely accepted going endemic Delta use species vaccinated people infect others. would concerned total breakthrough cases versus deaths, statistic likely missing significant portion asymptomatic mild symptom cases never get recorded. Likewise unvaccinated also asymptomatic mild cases get recorded. Ignore cases - ideally wand COVID be, virus infection threaten life. dataset moot outside establishing rate transmission.

The best comparison have, working with, number deaths hospitalizations associated vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. demonstrates effective vaccine preventing terminal case, clamps dataset completely documented, severe cases. Nobody slips radar reach ICU. best resource I've found currnetly using data number counties broke vaccinated vs unvaccinated hospitalizations create data. looks like stopped showing detailed hospitalization data. too! got 5% people vaccinate worth it. silly ever think 320 million people could ever go 2 whole weeks without leaving homes.

That never plan, though. people refused stay home non-essential reasons. locked all.

What national guard delivering food doors something? nation can't anything anymore. Can't even manufacture enough paper masks people.  much strongly disagree man subjects, genuinely hope pulls keeps advocating vaccine public forums. 

The last thing need go south, anti vax crowd say/think due vaccine. It’s usually good idea trust word strangers social media. Breakthru cases leading death. 

Breakthru cases leading death.

I'll say one time.

Breakthru cases leading death. around me. Illinois Conservative anti-vax / maskers literally psychos it'll probably take bit time full implementation. like line ear every business. [Check may help. What's favorite flavor crayon kind logic? get vaccine anyway tell boss yet? include Indiana?

Because so, really great tally since universities Indiana skirted governor's order.  Ah ok fair enough It’s really surprising that. Vaccination rates plummeting, would mountain task ask vaccinated people keep waiting indefinitely people receive vaccine intention getting, especially cases time. least get tested see you’re negative. person person, college students mix/see/have sex lot people! comments addressed irrelevant current article, I'll point using counter original argument ignores difference baseline hospitalization rates vaccinated versus unvaccinated people. vaccinated people

all data pointed vaccinated people absolutely catch spread COVID, science CDC ignored political reasons India. New England whole pretty well
I live Connecticut gotten COVID despite needing go lot school, recently vacation. recently everyone wearing masks. many activities day day life huddle 100s people, bumping etc? even tube results many contacts.  vaccines mandatory, would really need keep testing minority can't vaccinated? That's biggie. doeant get enforced. wont matter hear ya; here's see:

Though personally think stand united type thing. Sf doesnt exist bubble, 10s thousands residents counties come city work play everyday last thing want people come rules designed reliable residents.

Sf covid cases creeping up. like Florida enough feel theyve reason you’re feeling better, get another test, it’s negative probably be, you’re free. least 1 store employee shot killed it. (This Delta)
I think right retail worker risk his/her life it. least big box stores hire security it. wtf? could easily fly halfway around world vacation weeks kind money. Yeah…see comment below. I’m going entertain someone trying present misleading stats. right get change mind. let's everyone else know strongly feel it. Link doctor scientist said catch Covid vaccinated? They're lying? ? 

How many vaccinated people's died ? What? went 98%, would mean vaccine nothing/hurting people, since that's actually lower unvaccinated survival rate. Sure, rate go down, maybe 99.99%, certainly 98% ffs.  math isn’t shit. fact. projecting worse case scenario try make point doesn’t exist reality. people brain see right shit. Problem combine social media, ver divisive election throw pandemic top people lost minds. Gotta admit kinda relieving hear Paski (sp?) say aren’t going back March 2020 lockdowns. 

Been kinda downer couple weeks news glad know admin thinks we’ve made enough progress go back.  It’s going happen. uptick last. literally optimistic prepared heart ache. It’s working.

I’m sorry realistic plan B get back normal without vaccination goals met US - never - accept life indefinite goals ever met since keep changing due virus.  abbot desantis trying one other. like screwed preview 2024 primary. I'm ""stats dude"" basic human pattern recognition would suggest thing. Literally everywhere Delta gone far nearly exactly story; look curve every Indian region UK. They're identical, top bottom. What's worse Boris's bus, still money, idea brought us PM, ex advisor rumoured next line.....  That's fair point. would totally okay mask mandate exempts certain activities like athletics. think required places general public goes- athletic centers gyms easy enough risk adverse people like avoid, grocery stores aren't. 10-20% population vaccinated first 4 months year really helped numbers. 

It's meaningless statistic. calculate statistics meaningful, efficacy, risk decrease taking vaccine, etc. problem actually analyze numbers slam dunk argument going back normal/not wearing masks anymore/no working home, instead significantly better, vaccinated people still risk.

At point antivaxxers/maskers touting 99.95% survival rate start pandemic, always meaningless statistic since divided number deaths point time divided total population US. Started mild sinus symptoms. Developed tight cough, low grade fever, lost sense smell, activity intolerance ( heart rate would get high minimal activity) Basically didn’t feel well 3-4 days. Better now, still dry cough (been told stick around couple weeks) activity reserve hasn’t returned completely yet. gap March July Blacks Whites widened 6% 12% see

Statistics lie. liars make statistics. 

Here's another way present vaccination rate 75% whites July. 38% March.


Note: misread chart, btw. 11% March Asians Nyup. rely low-income blue-collar workers

Well, kill good luck finding new ones. People already saying fuck working McD 7.25. Either way gonna hard one soon. stuff CDC boosters necessary Pfizer wrong bullshit?  really true?  CDC bullshit thought somehow right thing do. Yeah think VA. R0 5 9.5 mentioned ~*club Hunt*~ 😂 forgot one sad little fact: Covid-19 antibodies last anywhere near long antibodies. likely require booster shots every six months so, rather annually like viruses.

Try googling Delta Plus. exist vaccines tested it. facing complete return 2020 unless take drastic mitigation efforts.

No we’re not. Stop this. People need come senses; vaccines eliminated overwhelming majority COVID mortality risk already. *Zero* people died Provincetown outbreak thousand people infected. vaccines job Delta. vaccinated people, crisis pretty much over. kids 12 get vaccinated late year first half next year, crisis *definitely* completely over. Early data? Like live play results US, UK, Europe... Hunt 3 finals week legitimately smelled lol buddy, Covid vaccinated, returned work trip feeling exactly you’re feeling. thought “you’ve gotta kidding me...”

Went doctor, told them, doc’s reaction “I highly doubt it, we’ll test you.” Test came back negative. 

Unfortunate we’re back anxiously assuming first sneeze. Really sucky situation Good! Employers need either mandate vaccine accept liable damage deaths caused anti-vaxxers getting employees sick dead. comment deserves awarding. know people mindset ""it kill me"" winds Oakland... Don’t forget Sturgis one Dakotas happening month.  listen ask questions now. state? die, vaccines *are failure.* scientist ever said get Covid vaccinated. guess vaccinated people choose socialize hang unvaccinated people, control else goes store do. symptoms vaccinated tested positive got sicker. shouldn’t spread disinformation. Always classy Oakland 🙄 many young Americans died Covid overall? Masks last things go. Yeah wearing uncomfortable seem prudent decision towards controlling pandemic Keep mind pandemics end. pandemics throughout history vast majority ended naturally, usually years. that's even true knew germ theory. technology create vaccines year. Spanish Flu pandemic ran 1918-1920. ended inspire us creating vaccine several decades. see point cares dangerous changes anything. stats I've seen driving even dangerous number provided personally avoid car unless absolutely necessary believe driving general still way dangerous activity. Driverless technology AI hopefully change eventually. Germany. One leading Covid deniers doctor. Q-Anon supporter. height pandemic took wife children Tanzania (You, know country late idiot president defeated Covid thoughts prayers) said felt safer Germany.  thought went got tested today, infect others. 

Otherwise would say blowout Pfizer. Delta 5 days now. 

like new federal employment either get shot get toilet bowl brush shoved nasal every week fucking gross

yelled fuck, leave bit pull out. 

Pretty sure people behind waiting turd little nervous 🥰 listen Dr. Osterholm’s podcast, talked breakthrough hospitalization (not death) numbers. said 2/3 67% breakthrough hospitalization “frail elderly immunocompromised”; 25% asymptotic cases caught routine screening admitted reason (non-COVID related). math right means 8% breakthrough hospitalizations symptomatic COVID populations outside frail elderly immunocompromised. 

I numbers deaths though.  ^cough minorities ^cough I’m sure you’re arguing. I’m saying vaccines work. President wanted send stronger message, he'd require military members take vaccine. Oh cool, seen yet. Curious outcome! would include people can't get shot figures? Exactly oh okay Pfizer, company makes vaccine, said it’s needed. i'm sure understand point. knew going vaccines 90-95% effective numbers bear out. missing? wont tale hope transmit - die am, actually. Muncie, substantial transmission area, high transmission still concerning. saying Republicans taking step step kill voters? think? 

Huh. think that, too. I'll god-damned ""why"" -- ""what"" unmistakable. Abbott's killing mood. feel like even super low numbers may hide bit story. feel like lot people could think getting vaccine makes completely immune. masks, social distancing, less hand washing. could expose even prior vaccine. clarify, entire state Florida. Last checked one county “substantial” rest high. CDC guidance counties classifications. appreciate link much, thank you. question i've struggling day. people multiple kids (I 3) masks? see lot people talking disposable ones, expensive use. used nicer cloth ones last year, get lot hate I've seeing. 6 year old, 11 14 year old. masked beginning, im seeing better options, soo darn expensive disposable, 1-2 day masks. teaching kids. dont enough teachers lose 40% staff. That's issue state wont mandate it. Lmfao dude, welcome reality. aren’t. Titles exist reason.  Well, good thing plenty people refuse believe this. Lol  Honestly main reason wear mask places despite local ordinance, trying respectful others. high covid transmission area? areas. everywhere. Could due people vaccine heaving less incentive get covid test? Australia seeing roughly 8% covid cases vaccinated early days Sydney lock down. retrospect, think mistake didn’t make public service commercials showed real people stomachs, intubated, induced comas voiceovers family members talking scared were. Followed interviews survivor afterwards describe long term impacts health. “Taste smell still haven’t returned. It’s months can’t think clearly. I’m x medications doctors say it’s likely rest life.” Stuff like that.

It’s stats numbers. It’s medical details survive usually known inner circle. might hear Facebook friend got won’t know real frequent long term affects, really know went hospital. think piped living rooms prime time. people land. common clay new West. know… morons. Sad. could better prepared. Florida’s actual numbers population basis bad like right now. agree NY hotspots March April testing limited. areas undercounted far. However, case US. Props sticking it! I'm glad came acrou info. Every day Texas somehow beats worst state. Whoever comes creative way beat gets point. know bunch coworkers got vaccine right well. went 40% teachers vaccinated 60% new rule. guideline sum 50 last 7 days average.

see section :  
Indicator - two indicators suggest different transmission levels, higher level selected	Low Transmission Blue	Moderate Transmission Yellow	Substantial Transmission Orange	High Transmission Red

of page : Vaccinated covid counted cases  Yup. Local officials previously permitted implement new public health interventions region exceeded ""high hospitalization"" threshold 15% COVID-19 occupancy area hospitals. last Thursday, Gov. Abbott [signed executive prohibiting local governments imposing restrictions even threshold exceeded. sheer coincidence, four regions (Belton/Killeen, Bryan/College Station, Galveston, Victoria) since [exceeded one last week Massachusetts showing huge amount carriers shots last time pepperoni pizza jr high, 1989. Springfield MO wife saying real fortunate wave early.

Because could get help. states starting Delta wave going able get help I'm afraid.

Here good chart hospitalizations still new record district announced masks optional year. Optional. College campuses around us requiring masks, sure, let's group least protected together room 5 hrs day. It'll fine. 

Fuck that. guess I'm homeschooling. beyond pissed. say nurses. said different education. huge respect work do, many start ""as medical professional"" anti-vax crap medical education present having.  Luckily bad guys.  haha yeah plus think travel, people SWARMED town, lots partying stuff... 


The LGBTQ folks especially gay men serious (at least generations around it) AIDS crisis. understood least trying protect everyone mean time known delta would acting vaccines- variants' ability replicate enough vaccinated peoples' noses/upper respiratory infected that's resulted mask recommendations changing plus infectious happens be. Takes lot less get sick. 


but yeah going parties soon lol. either, trust people state see reason risk it. young kids thank excited. son hopefully going tomorrow. trapped unable get place vaccine. somehow convinced daughter allow w us go get Walmart. great, that's higher likely 69% vaccination rate there. 

At 80% efficacy, means 5 unvaccinated people would get it, instead 1 vaccinated person would. cases go 5X higher (they've gone WAAAAY lately), vaccinated people getting infected 5X fewer cases everybody unvaccinated. 

Just changing behavior going restaurants vaccinated would dangerous unvaccinated (if going restaurants 5X risky going). 

People need realize direct protection really helpful, lot cases area, prudent still careful. Two months study results look good, Pfizer meets new data requirements recently requested FDA FDA shifts advisory committee said meeting June. 

I really hope soon! trying say ASTM level 1 masks absolutely nothing protect others Delta variant already vaccinated? matter contagious virus see medical mask zero effect claim. 
“Numbers presented L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer last Tuesday indicate fivefold increase new Covid patients 12 years old. (For perspective 12, eligible vaccination, make 15% county’s population.) raw case numbers low relative county residents ages 12 49, data indicating spread infections not.

In two-week period ending July 18, 89 cases per 100,000 people age 0 4 112 cases per 100,000 age 5 11. pediatric Covid deaths recorded county period June 18 July 18. Ferrer’s presentation board indicated hospitalization rate children age 0 4 Los Angeles County doubled month. 

The spike case rates among young precisely many health experts feared, daily vaccinations still low compared last winter state’s vaccination rate citizens — including eligible vaccines — remains 55%. Many kids state due back school shortly, masks mandated.

The news one East Bay area school district recently returned person learning promising. 11-school Brentwood district confirmed least 15 positive Covid cases among students staff three days new school year. cases among kids often mild, rapid spread due Delta variant — possibility new variants popping virus mutates among new hosts — pretty picture kids parents, who’ve already year pandemic worries, mention homeschooling.” fucking stupid. point you’re adult safely get vaccine you’re *still* unvaccinated you’ve made decision give fuck happens you. Stop letting society’s dumbest people hold us hostage like hospital food don't.

I hope never try, Delta nasty one showing state state lot fully vaccinated people still hospitalized dying COVID

I read exactly hospitalization rate among fully vaccinated people COVID-19 ranged effectively zero (0.00%) California, Delaware, D.C., Indiana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Vermont, Virginia 0.06% rates death among fully vaccinated people COVID-19 even lower, effectively zero (0.00%) two reporting states, Arkansas Michigan 0.01%.

And cases numbers may include hospitalizations deaths due COVID-19. enforced grocery pharmacy department store workers make shit money, guaranteed deal plenty adult crybabies won’t put mask back 7 minute Luckys experience. don’t even want evidence third doses necessary wasting 150 million doses could used get people first shot? so, presumably JJ, moderna, pfizer make new vaccine much quicker first one Learning loss compounds. linear. doubt AAP, CDC, secretary state taken EUA timeline consideration saying still worth person education Sorry, fixed. That’s 70% *adults*, mind let’s really here: reason America situation people getting first dose CHOICE, people unable get third shot.  It’s hard tell, without questions simply massive surge March/April 2020 couldn’t test it. NYC March FAR worst area US gotten plenty states look far far worse case number. point say stood trying kill people? 200% ideally hit 90%, 75%+ adequate really stop bleeding. Agreed. Would love nothing see bite butt come election time. seems give less less crap state day sights set White House. Yeah, depleted water supply vital agriculture nation, course can't expect people live suburbs built middle actual desert nice thick lawn.and farmers plant can't grow alfalfa ship places like China middle east feed cows there. Everyone started: ""Ok either ends vaccine herd immunity""

Everyone vaccines started rolled out: ""Ok let's wait little see""

Everyone like 200 mil shots nothing happened: ""Nah I'm getting it"" 

???   CDC memo gets leaked, revealing knew vaccinated could spread virus publicly admitted it,

i understand thing right now. admitted months ago absolutely ridiculous. America “under siege” millions morons refuse get single dose, people can’t get third dose. 

Let’s absolutely clear this: haven’t conquered pandemic choice point. people eligible got vaccine, wouldn’t situation. Thinking Americans deserve third dose (despite little existing evidence outside settings like LTC showing necessary) world gets single dose absolutely entitlement. 

America build grave one, giving third dose hoarding vaccines purpose won’t help all. thing really help getting people first second shot.  Reddit refuses understand might one liberal uses word leaders I’ve ever seen. America remarkable lack leaders state local level. RSV vaccine go anyone premees yet? Haha, searched I'm sure someone crazy theory, found [Dry People literally froze death administration. TEXAS. Yes no. There's national database (maybe all?) states one. However, experience (with WA state system) they're pretty clumsy use; data entry relatively simple, there's quick way lookup people already vaccinated. Individuals and/or providers get records, every person walks makes appointment would prohibitively time-consuming vaccinate clinic busy pharmacy. 


Also, there's really reason check everyone. check box says 1st 2nd dose, check listed contraindications, sign line, give shot. dumb-ass coming 5th dose, willing lie get it, that's bud. reminds early suggestion nyc participate gloryholes rather traditional carnal adventures. LPN stands licensed practical nurse. nurses nothing like nursing assistant. take NCLEX-PN. RN degree, really lowest level RN semester two longer PN. would think LPNs nurses? vaccine cure!!!! keep hospital. Healthy people carriers others ailments medical know 100%. Well get sick much better chance living somebody  Ridiculous think mandate soon vaccine available   forget snowbirds count state primary residence  gets back it’s insane asymptomatic get tested. wants volunteer go two weeks without pay? Yeah, conservatives grocery shopping (checks notes) West Oakland, California. That’s rough. another reason get vaccine suppose. consider lucky losing senses long-term isn’t hard, type lanyard, mark badge, etc. issued prove vaccination status. employee uncomfortable providing proof vaccination wearing something showing that, wear mask indoors. 

I know multiple companies large smaller successfully done it. Unless state passed specific law last months isn’t anything illegal it. lawyers figure out, fortune 100 company want to. little determined took 7-8 years Tequila, still 27 years later can't touch Sambuca trying catch New Years Eve worked 1. Lol Cool ad hominem attack bro. Nice try. Quite funny coming white guy called Vietnam ""his country"". one? amazing. Thank do. supposed go Taiwan summer Covid struck there. order comfortable, decided get instead, HEPA filter makes pretty comfortable: Well thats good, tbh I'm hear waiting booster shots get approved delta, bring em on, cant wait mine.  Like lambda? age well. Δ I’m guessing you’re upset you’re stuck Thailand cases exploding they’re rely much vaccines. forget reject gay people's cake requests got Pfizer (CVS) getting j&amp;j March. didn’t even ask ID. thing asked first second Pfizer. oh ya, i'm sure ""proof vaccination"" IMPOSSIBLE easily fake, especially college-age students expertise fake IDs still may able to. data say one way other. variable know exactly many people exposed Provincetown? Vaccines percentage game. never going 100% able transmit, considerably less likely. 

Yes, numbers concerning transmission standpoint, remember people likely engaging risky activities going nieces nephews. article says ADF supporting NWS police. NWS police enforce rules according second link posted. Maybe ADF doesn’t enforce rules rules still enforced . point rules excessive.

Even Australia eliminates virus within country, can’t live bubble forever. virus eventually enter country different parts world. Whether it’s Delta variant future variant. seems like rules delaying inevitable. Hopefully huge portion population vaccinated soon. Vaccination rates increasing, Delta wave seems peaking even vaccine surge could possibly help. know. many kids denied future parents continue pretend online learning works. sad. 
*There good news report vaccination front. ADPH reported 68,477 vaccine doses administered week ending July 27, recent data available. That’s 43,590 doses previous seven days, increase 57%. Alabama still ranks near bottom list states territories percentage residents vaccinated, however.* recognize vaccines work, really, really well? seem like masks like babies like diapers.  I've seen signs getting tested much vaccines. Even went parking lot signs front ""drive thru Covid test"" ""free Covid testing"". see absolutely perspective normal parents are. 

I quite literally know know hundreds parents navigating situation *one* managing situation insanely this. no, I’m parent, recognize parents aren’t completely insane paranoid scientifically illiterate morons either.  simple fact vaccination really stop anyone catching it, reduces bad outcomes get it...why there's still people thinks prevents astonishing. reaction j&amp;j also Pfizer?  schools need update school dress code require school colored matching facial coverings must worn nose mouth. See, mask mandate, school dress code. school district allows kids back school year vote every single bozo school board got delta vax, kicked ass, can't imagine vaccine. So? get job world. Yeah. That’s awful sentiment understandable. People getting burnt losing compassion. 1918 Spanish Flu lasted two years.

Without true vaccine. The""vaccine"" prepared targeted bacteria thought causative agent.

There lockdown population-wide stay-at-home order. was, *some* cities, ban large gatherings school closures. measures lasted weeks.

From

See Table 2 details. got problem decimal places there, friend. Well reason, definitely plays part. Yeah, saw one person quoting R10 first thought error since ancestral strain peaked R3. Wondering developed better binding affinity ACE2  developed spike proteins, binding multiple receptors somehow. Howdy, Fellow Texan! assume? boat. Kid 9 forced in-school starting next Wednesday. fortunate WFH last year, ISD provided robust virtual learning experience. one person family positive test symptoms year. effort probably go shitter. Thanks, Hot Wheels! actually really sad. southern state’s leaders failed constituents telling American rugged individualism could stronger virus. Conspiracy theorists smart. Many believe lizard people. Anyone concerns getting *extremely* rare reaction COVID vaccine speak doctor advice. People making assumptions causing get vaccine, putting risk. How, legally speaking almost thing fining business violated shut mandates 2020? even close level water consumption almond industry assign morality people, actions. 

Normally, Person bad thing, might suspect Person bad person. Morality assigned based action. 

For them, person ""good person"", bad things. faith person, they'll excuse action chosen person. 

Therefore, Trump it, must good. delta plans relevant stat? legit don’t understand reassuring. many exposed? it’s one died, that’s problem even 99.99% didn’t die. kids? that?? Ok thank much detailed advice. person I’m family asthma health conditions, it’s even severe big. I’ve never asthma attack, don’t really symptoms asthma(maybe 1-2 times year). Yes I’m aware mom overprotective. Even virus limited certain things. see you’re parent.  100% efficacy mean instead get milder version virus. 

No said vaccinated person experiences breakthrough infection milder version virus. Disease Virus synonyms. severity disease experience dependant virus immune system. Even become infected, generally vaccinated individuals immune system better equipped combat invading virus non vaccinated person. vaccinated person's immune system better prepared, able reduced much damage viral infection cause reduces severity disease experience.

Keep mind exception. vast majority vaccinated individuals become infected all. Hysteria max.

Focus deaths filling vaccinations groups that's still possible, useless restrictions. unscientific visually good indicator cases deaths Israel, see deaths follow cases pretty well (with small lag time), until...this spike, even accounting lag deaths longer tied cases like before. 

This two reasons :

1. ones test positive much younger past, thus smaller chance get hospitalized die

2. ones get hospitalized younger before, less likely die


Despite cases rising Israel whole month (from 70 2000 per day 7 day rolling average, 29 fold increase), 7 day rolling average deaths went 0.30 to...2.50. heart breaks medical staff there.

We know many personally. &lt;3 Thank great uncle’s sister got breakthrough covid. fully vaccinated. Passed away today age 94… living old age home Aventura Florida Fast food already prioritizes drive thru orders anyway. hopium, gone. someone else Dallas surrounded left leaning vaccinated folks....maybe try East Texas, Panhandle, Oilfields? Florida could never 1st far Make Abbott work triage Pretty much everything 99.999% talking safety. E.g. USA likely die malaria, shigellosis amebiasis given year.

Of course, usually formulated ""chances die one million"", ... note Six Sigma formulate chances defect vs chances defect.

Never mind that, no, 500k people world wide died result vaccine even did, would smaller chance dying shot COVID itself.

Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 page 11 report. log odds confidence interval long Covid (after two shots) goes .4:1 nearly 1:1. Meaning risk long Covid hard pin fully vaccinated could help substantially slightly reduce risk Yeah, done kindergarten round May ready send school. long covid kids articles started popping Delta hit US, luckily hit state hard yet Fall 2020 saw first real spike IMHO. live rural area family members vaccination. definitely get subtle subtle pushback. 

Your last sentences really hit yesterday. thinking, wrong overreacting? end, kid gets spend time family sister. get wait vaccinated say myself, could live that. understand ppl levels comfort many cannot stay home. TOTALLY get feel ppl choices made them. almost let others make decision to. letting doubt knowledge others might think, mom peer pressure, small town politics. ppl live decision indecision. end internal pep talk came peace all. hope wrong coming months ppl say 'I told so.' imagine anywhere USA signs large scale. 

We live pretty progressive area California Bay area, relatively high vaccination rates eligible.

December 2020 2 weeks ago get tested possible exposure someone tested positive.

In cases public ""mass"" testing day half wait needing schedule test opening available, results took 3.5 days sample collected, looking appointments available asymptomatic testing currently 4 appointments per half hour time slots.

Our samples still shipped San Dimas; public testing even regional processing facility. woefully equipped rapid mass testing. fine - wear surgical mask ported/valved N95.

Due recent emergencies, I've fly several airlines last months....It seems care less face, long something...they happy tell keep on, covering nose...However, good guy/gal - wear surgical it, spewing breath everywhere :-)

Due various seat neighbors (some anti-mask...and seating folks middle seat now...ugh) - get plane without well fitted N95 (valved) surgical mask it..I've considered moving half face respirator P100s, want lightning rod antimaskers.... Uh, trust me, MAKE room/bed family member.

Others die home. huh? people ""chose respect Corona rules!"" got vaccinated. long term solution crisis, much effective mitigation measures. cases explode turn “SEE?! never anything ever again!”

Lovely. sorry mother. I’m happy it’s given new important opportunities branch career path wise. get suck enforcement vaccines laid feet restaurant gym employees NYC that's fair... Predictable, like rising TIDE 1- reaction wasnt allergic prettt significant
2- ya duh could still spread it, that’s said literally said hope dont spread it. cautious person know comes spreading germs, even covid. 
3- talked doctors (yes, team health issues) board getting vaccine. 

Maybe dont assume people idiots didnt get vaccine. Lets honest, know assumed i’m ignorant.

Pretty crazy everyone always “if dont get vaccine, people’s health risk” want put health risk getting vaccine. never said vaccine force field. result single event though.

Finally, Leana Wen, great job describing [Washington Post fact vaccinated sometimes spread disease mostly relevant people live elderly, children, immunocompromised. They're hurting friends/family. mean excuse ""congrats playing yourself"" laminate it. need 3rd shot able recorded ... unless put sticker something mean even without Covid, Florida dicey proposition.

What’s dicey without COVID? That's see too. I've dedicate portion time taking care mom since got covid, security UI given time live healthier attempt learn coding.  works got vaccinated New York. Otherwise best bet probably keeping high quality scanned images CDC card digital wallet. Comments covid article work support this. Lots comments along lines of: ""So vaccine get spread covid mask, vaccine get spread covid mask. get vaccine?""

Trying explain much lower chance getting covid greater odds mild seem resonate. hung ""vaccinated getting spreading wear masks!"" hint interpreting Bloomberg link: Black Hispanic people less likely Republicans consumers conservative media. think incredibly rare consider sterilizing immunity. illness / suppressed immunity factors involved breakthrough measles cases. disagree. Lots small businesses refuse mandate it. 

For example, vaccinated, CEO said require vaccination encourage it. 28 people vaccinated vaccinated underlying conditions hospitalized





So people asking old, 'But vaccinated, care others?' 



This why.  type mandates far effective mask mandates capacity restrictions. Vaccines effective slowing spread decreasing severity symptoms. uptake vaccinations seems fallen off, stage someone's fault getting covid still unvaccinated?

ofc portion individuals might able get various health reasons, covid never going away whether like It’s wild think kids today just…don’t get chickenpox. disease near-100% infection rate child, wasn’t actually long vaccine hit. rarely fatal, rare catch once, literally *every single person* could expect catch it. generally child, adult infections uncommon. infectious. 

Of course vaccine good thing, chickenpox leaves risk shingles later life, isn’t nearly carefree harmless. Getting chickenpox normal, natural part childhood one ever missed. 

Super tangential, obviously. interesting think about. people vaccinated? Doesn’t seem like issue unless weren’t. Vaccinated people significantly less likely virus first place therefore significantly less likely spread others. Florida 8th population density little misleading vast swathes nothingness.  people live coast along I4 corridor. Breakthrough infections generally asymptomatic. So, you’re vaccinated, may even know got it, certainly you’ve already contagious. Umm…duh? sure pushing ""childhood trauma"" means push another agenda? point making. meant fully vaxxed covid, sense 90%+ co-morbidities immunosuppressed. paid

Ha ha. Mine never returned second dose May. Last cycle week first dose. thought finally stopped.
Im regular vaccinated everything; nothing stopped besides pregnancy. really close, looked way polling places closed. way portrayed news protracted count help perception.

Biden won:

306-232 electoral votes

81.2 million - 74.2 million votes

51.3 - 46.9 % total vote Soon enough you’ll treated like people smoke public NAMBLA. Enjoy last hurrah!

Oh? govt force people get tattoo wrists? work 70 years ago? Wait still talking vaccines? 😏 vaccinated Karens going festival blame get/spread Corona unvaccinated people chose respect Corona rules! We're find masks even useful stopping Delta spreading. Data places like masking never political issue, says maybe not. Maybe reduces spread enough takes 6 weeks instead 4 weeks whole student body infected.

Kids fine, part, I'm expecting massive spread elementary schools higher-level schools there's high vaccination rate. take extra precautions massive wave infections area spread relatively low. though? usually dozen cases probably detect much cases countries test EVERYONE. keep new variants emerge, regardless events like Lollapalooza, much world doesn’t even access vaccines. That’s going reality foreseeable future. BIG issue fact states lowest percentage adults vaccinated states right BANNING use masks schools/businesses.

Children generally low risk complications COVID, emotional suffering would great find carriers brought COVID family God forbid, lose parents COVID, emotional guilt may high.

Ideally, Vaccination rate high (like 70%+) among eligible population, mask mandate lifted transmission rate quite low.

But current situation ESPECIALLY states low vaccination rate. fix issue FIRST, like give incentives like ""we lift mask mandate vaccination rate reaches 70% full"" something like that.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Well yeah, whole point going vaccinated adults cheap way make vaccination figure look bigger actually is.

The general goal always habe 75% total pop vaccinated. suspect strongly next one close, strong correlation GOP voters unvaccinated people transform strong correlation GOP voters people died COVID-19. Strange days government actually passes laws help spread plague, people sending children harm's way.

I get never will.

Happy deaths, disease long term illness ya guess. whole family (two parents, four kids) terrible cold, everyone us tested negative Covid, four us fully vaccinated safely assume cold. RSV also bad right now. viruses back. 

So, wouldn’t assume people aren’t testing. bloody already.

We Belgium it. want able open schools september pretty normal... gonna say thing in, say, 10 years? makes think worse time vaccinated person attending music festival 2031? You’re still gonna risk spreading point. Test oklahoma deer keep walking steady around like humans even anymore. strange behavior lately here. Like walk outside standing running anything. airline enforcing policy specifies mask type? I’d like keep mind emergency travel foreseeable future.

It's fine - wear surgical mask ported/valved N95.

Due recent emergencies, I've fly several airlines last months....It seems care less face, long something...they happy tell keep on, covering nose...However, good guy/gal - wear surgical it, spewing breath everywhere :-)

Due various seat neighbors (some anti-mask...and seating folks middle seat now...ugh) - get plane without well fitted N95 (valved) surgical mask it.... Including entire population: 58% one shot, 50% fully vaxxed.

The massive amount spread happen probably convince people get vaxxed. numbers supposedly seen uptick US lately. lot people going late. Requirement register quarantine list address quarantined left would smart public health action. nobody smart this. lowers amount virus general exposed to, Delta variant defies that. it’s entirely limiting spread, reduce hospitalization among get COVID, thus reducing pressures medical system overall.

medical models University Washington suggests wearing masks would great job reducing spread virus even third one little shows people going fence, knows. ugh. say rest us chill latest mandates impending lockdown? Negative tests show couple days event happened negative. It’s completely meaningless imo. mother 101 fever symptomatic still negative test. Didn’t show positive till 3 days later. Id say forced rather swayed cause u aren’t allowed either things unless u got vaccine. Key word mandate  mean keep reporting cases deaths way lower would expect cases. thankful well. using crutch temporarily. i’m graduated i’ll livable salary dream career wouldnt need unemployment anymore. That’s goal. think governments sending home test kits every person tell take quick test feeling down. 

It might perfect - like said - people arent going bothered go get test feel little I’ve also heard numerous people weren’t checking test said checking it. People using old test peoples  think chances getting covid 80% effective vaccine? lmao people afraid vaccine ""shedding?"" happy exposed us?  work (**very small**) percentage folks **legit** medical reason can't get vaxed? Granted, that's small #, exist, either allergic something vax, medical condition either permenantly temporarily prevents covid vax. dining gym them? article behind paywall, clear order spells folks category discriminated against. I'm one employers requiring vax, working medical exception paperwork employee, told can't eat work allergy kinda hits home me.  outdoor gatherings earlier pandemic contribute increased cases. given card J J shot, second shot come back reminded of. Look Jr, science science regardless experience. Frankly you’re exhibiting conservative mindset VaCcINaTiOnS PrOhIbiTs SpReAd quite literally research indicates otherwise. Next let’s hear bit took Covid test also virus free. It’s oldie goody. *will  NJ (horribly designed functional) app well They've saying practically every single time - crowded beaches, motorbike rally, BLM marches. time know could said right Euros - UK 90% seroprevalence, impact barely felt. think extremely telling longer peep ""I told so"" events, hear precipitous drop cases happened occur straight UK's full reopening without masks.

Time experts understand covid longer problem vulnerable vaccinated never 30s, concerns covid, going accept ghastly, mysophobic zero-covid utopia, matter much whinge complain. Covid restrictions temporary sacrifice face serious emergency, permanent way life. didn’t know that.

How would know that? title article literally says indoor dining fitness. Good. that's basically CDC said I’ve done LA, STL, DC. make Houston look like walk park. Decades instant gratification brought us here. Complete lack patience, perseverance, concept greater good. true! I’d shocked Missouri wasn’t hot horrible humidity too, yet rise cases leveling lot. weird… That's probably best route verification. Code already card, generated single source name linked code scanned/accepted state. Unfortunately they've already given 100 million cards US without codes. sure get new verifiable cards hands already vaxxed. Perhaps folks would need go back got shot(s) get new card. Another logistics nightmare. :) ""Considering whole population cohort (rather hospital cases), test-negative analysis estimate vaccine effectiveness preventing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection showed that, compared unvaccinated, least 14 days second dose, BNT162b2 (Pfizer–BioNTech vaccine) offered good protection: 92% (95% CI 90–93) gene-negative, \[BETA\] 79% (75–82) gene-positive \[DELTA\].

**\[BRACKETS\]** added me

&amp;#x200B;

Another score 80% effectiveness data repeated places. 

What capture people positive test.  hitting last years level 164,000,000 people vaccinated. Thats intense Delta is! think we're going park brakes joke ""dozen thousand"" lol tip top science shop talkin right murica folks. yall see here? thems gud thinkins  vaccines wane fact now. true. One thing I've learned last year leaders almost universally horrendous communicating. still get it, get sick bad. catching yes I'm unsure lower chances vaccine. 

Having kids sucks ofc husband vaccinated 2yr old...so far lucky caught yet worry. know everyone sub anti-conspiracy glad know least one conspiracy going come handy guys. Since proof vaccination little honor system moment need full proof way showing vaccine status required. Luckily technology already exists used humans before. distant future scannable RFID chips implanted skin like pet dog information needed gain entry Walmart (for poor folx) Whole Foods (rich folx)  even ""most likely"" they'll fine. overwhelmingly case children unaffected. putting much risk putting car going literally anywhere risk dying covid. unfortunately, we're point yet entire medical delivery system teetering due huge tsunami unvaxxed patients flooding hospitals. easy say let die. fine. lot days once. question mandating vaccinations. whether state force private businesses conduct business unvaccinated people even people can't produce piece paper says vaccinated. Quite different. always I’d like sources educational purposes please NYC incredibly touristic place. think say tourists can’t dine in? generally: human beings certain cognitive biases lead completely misunderstand probabilities risk. 

For example, many, many people said 538's model ""wrong"" 2016 gave Trump like 29% chance winning. days leading election, talk fait accompli - going lose, look odds. odds winning different ""losing"" game Russian Roulette two bullets. Space helmets work! /$ Don’t get vaccine don’t want to. don’t expect enjoy amenities modern society can’t get board stopping spread communicable diseases. 150 years certain demographic pushing things need scared one... 

""meh ain't big thang."" republicans come pro-vaccine realized base getting fucking rocked numbers show lol. state require food servers wash hands going bathroom? allowed bodily autonomy?  I’m really surprised isn’t common comment vaccine passports idea comes up. Businesses lose family customers kids chance get vaccinated. tightened security gates days went on. time Sunday came around, people checking wristbands vaccination cards standing front opening (hopefully) prevent sort thing best could. UK proved Delta biggie vaccinated population. 70 daily death average peak 50,000 cases day dominated Delta vs. 1200 daily death average peak 60,000 cases day (which mostly Alpha time). Vaccines work. keep mind, ""fun"" comes expense slammed hospitals delayed medical care non-covid illnesses. Sure zero impact 30 healthy, kind delay care compounds problems middle-aged seniors. I've seen South Park Covid Special. exactly breathing. mean... viable one point crossed threshold ages ago Bill Lee idiot Delta variant first detected December 2020 India. I'm guessing already circulation Kumbh (the festival), would've aided reach many parts country possibly less affected previous waves. Last year Covid remember hearing bars literally ""spitting contests"" see spit furthest. brightest people there. Would nice get official confirmation that’s plan though Lmfao 😂😂 Can't even reply anything logical sub without getting silenced automod. give up. People like always problem.

This sub brainwashed garbage. live Denver expect point too. Question - hell lost vaccine card? I've looking around lately, I've moved since getting vaccinated could gone AF.   least vaccinated demo almost everywhere. Primary driving force getting vaccine fear, guess group fears Covid least? I’m ok assigning certain number beds unvaccinated covid patients unvaccinated play Wild West NL opened nightclubs basically unvaccinated demographic acted surprised cases shot up. They’re cause, surge means unvaccinated vaccinated higher risk things calm — risk getting sick risk dealing overwhelmed health care system covid non-covid problems. spike driven unvaccinated unfortunately *all us* get deal consequences even decided applies kids 12 not, I'm optimistic taking vaccinations outside city account.  based data July 26th. Delta ramping whole month I’d imagine least Delta considered. whatever do, laminate otherwise make permanently impossible add things cards. need third booster shot future would probably want add card well. right

Can't see covid also cover work sick. Rhetoric? extremely unlikely catch transmit disease. I'm living proof 

I guess attempt educate topic chiming in? Shocking Never understood that. 

Why would go wait doctors office could get vaccinated pop booth mall. Pepperidge Farms remembers. things reach point prudent wear mask *while actively chewing food*, make sense eat public begin with? Unless unvaccinated clamoring protection still don’t see point mask mandates. anti mask people anti mask states aren’t going back masks mostly vaccinated state going mask mandates really pat back kind thing.   Delta variant identified Dec 2020 IIRC, festival April, no. people eat entire cow believe beef??? digital vaccine passports California show phones. Perhaps NYC same. It’s either fact somebody gets second dose 8-12 weeks later max 2-dose levels later game. mean is, somebody got doses 1 2 January almost 6 full months waning immunity. Somebody got dose 1 January dose 2 April 3 months waning immunity, meaning they’re 3 months behind (or ahead, depending look it) process. Personally, think it’s probably bit both, that’s guy Reddit speculating. Wait u ICU 😏  Oh achieved decades ago 100% serious. pretty easy fake vaccine card tho sooooo itll happen. Yeah, American too, point less ""the government"" ""Texas"" seems trying fuck people. That's issue ""Our Government"" mine seems trying keep ass alive. know of. participate monoclonal study could impacted symptoms. Believe me, lot staff happy it. really fucked up. interviewed 60 Minutes. US decided individual states responsible tracing instead building one platform. Like teacher shortages. accurate, even ""experts"". lot women told help addicts, look corner whenever I’m bad texting girls thinks highly Texas lmao

If Kansas left conferences wouldn’t read… EU considered fully protected 4 weeks j&amp;j shot less 37% whack Deep South, start back yard travel around fine. Guardian continues push end world one ever allowed enjoy themselves. I'm looking know everyone's opinion's NY's decision requiere proof vaccination. 
I'm it, problem antivaxers catching they're flooding hospitals people need cancer treaments elective surgeries rejected they're focusing antivaxers antivaxers petri dishes new variants. 
My boyfriend it, says government power people's bodies already ""your body choice"" vaccinated person going assuming risk still catching hypocritical judge others vaccinated assuming risk (he's fully vaccinated btw always responsible person). 


What guys think? totally get view again, fact innocent people need treatments denied hospital full makes agree vaccination proof. People mocking Florida long ever pandemic. glad two tier society born right eyes. nice around people demand obedience state. hope really enjoy new utopia never sickness sadness world. Imagine charge deferring expert. Like, things gotten loony might forgotten atrocious non-medical professionals dismissing experts save lives. 

The blood hands DeSantis others like never wash off. hypothetical. big thing week new England study vaccinated people spread Delta much unvaccinated.

It's super frustrating that's reality Would helped 15 unvaccinated people (out 28 total) vaccinated first place. ...to surprise absolutely one who's ever heard Florida interviewed epidemiologist really thinks need stay current stay-home, always-masked mode decades?

There's stay-home orders US right now. ""always-masked""? mask mandates certain indoor settings times, private businesses deciding this. Nobody suggesting stay-home order always-masked mode decades. Stop fearmongering. “Bobby Newport wants understand election.” far vaccinations sites sites obtain ID. top that, vaccination sites open retail hours ID sites tend along lines 9-5.

I'd pass nearly 20 pharmacies clinics could get vaccine way nearest place could get new ID. Sad say, average American care people.

FTFY Maybe guy cut politics worried judged every little decision makes puts millions citizens danger. guarantee covid didn’t kill many people, would never mask mandates lockdowns. Even don’t think death good metric, still relevant context conversation. definitely doable. 800k 1 million shots day keep up, reach 80% month. already 70% 1 shot. 10% what? 30 million people? 1 million shots day. friend telling yesterday one friends used forged CDC card gain entry Italy. Last week couple found entering Canada phony card believe fined 20,000 (USD CAD unclear).

These people put everyone danger. Lock up. right, would done immediately (self-Isolation month, everyone), say need years this.

also, stage, whole world needs vaccines, otherwise new variants brewing. understanding needed planet. far biggest fear mongering piece seen yet. Completely disregards sort positivity vaccine. completely rails insane. Jesus Christ! could imagine working hospitals. must absolutely exhausting. *could?* lol teachers informed Covid days built in, quarantined use personal/sick days. Masks optional, live conservative area, one really wore masks last year either, doubt year. Buy immunaband easily show vaccination card/status. following code “FRIEND-HTHRDT3” knock 20% off! crowd shot Lollapalooza. mitigation done flash vaccination card verified people BLM protests masked, Delta. Totally different ballgame.

Maybe turn fine breathe easy events like this. certainly hope so. It'll certainly make great case study either way. Every mitigation strategy needs cost benefit analyzed.

Banning children would better covid mitigation, would great costs. measure would definitely increase backlash it. would cause great harm economy businesses parents would choose get instead.

The goal vaccine mandate punish unvaccinated, incentivize encourage vaccination. Since vaccination allowed children 12, mandate without exemption would serve punish rather offer solution. Doesn’t help fast majority truly believe pandemic politicians eased removed restrictions  28 people, 13 vaccinated. got backwards. Almost half *were* vaccinated. Seriously though, hospitalization numbers well-run country/state seeing Aug 2021. Absolutely disgraceful leadership even disappointing significant portion still support him. 92% ticket holders proved vaccination. cause jump cases. even cares  testing positive implies getting tested Variants going keep coming either way. Also based known coronaviruses, it’s likely new variants less deadly contagious. discounts fact variants going keep coming can't seriously reduce infections. Give Covid enough time, even vaccinated protected.

Uninformed fear mongering - nearly medically impossible virus mutate something vaccine protect against. 

Also, consider moment, rest entire unvaccinated world every country even hold candle vaccination rate US first world countries. Nothing stop variants. point matter get vaccinated don't. vaccinated, literally nothing worry (beyond statistical noise). 

Worrying ""variants"" moving goalposts without ounce reasoning it. realize posted 70% Americans least one shot. keep around 800k-1 million shots day, getting 80,85% herd immuntiy totally doable next 4 5 weeks. pandemic truly over. Covid longer overwhelm hospitals. really end goal here. Would nice eliminate covid nature ship sailed long time ago. 99.99% vaccinated people need hospitalization die, pandemic. Good trying. need keep up. recognized herd stupidity. math always awaiting discovery essential truth. mostly stupid. Unfortunately. It’s many people chasing illicit boosters. It’s I’m thinking same. Lalaforlosers. idiot would attend something like current circumstances. course, live nation idiots. odds mutation stay same, selection pressure goes up. Growing number companies brands requiring proof vaxx, we're going see awful lot r-publicfreakouts fight porn posts non-vaxxers stopped door.

Saved work.  end well. tool. He’s got blood hands. Insulting decide get vaccine exactly way convince people get it. want Americans do? Get shot?

I double vaxxed mid February make better you? course not. read post responded to, see literally wrote ‘I already mask 8 hours day office’. yes wear mask work. 

That said, believe point pandemic that’s it’s problem protect someone doesn’t want protect herself. got vaccine. protects Covid. doesn’t matter whether spread not. want protected like am, get shot. don’t want protected, it’s problem. 

It’s job protect someone won’t protect themselves. It’s society’s job. It’s job. deaths? Yes, good point-- essential activities. choose get vaccinated, less recreational things do. it’s mind boggling…decades making war liberal arts, education, reason led us here, past.

Oh, probably, Yankees fan seems crazy Yankees, one early major league baseball teams reach desired 85% vaccination level, third group players (or players coaches) contract Covid. 

(Although 85% applies so-called ""tier one"" personnel, players staff direct contact players, coaches trainers, vaccination percentage players could less 85%.) History never read $3,000 misspelled “will”. Lol vaccine dangerous fuckin know kid, let's stop right there.

But given expense drug need IV administration, it’s really practical give someone mild symptoms. That’s one thing makes drug *this* study promising comparison.

STOP PROJECTING GET VAXXED. “High covid transmission” seems ambiguous None 99.999% stats useful without context: what's percentage non-vaccinated Americans gotten deadly case COVID-19? (It's easy miss we're talking fatal cases).

Let's take look numbers: Worldmeters tells since beginning pandemic, 629,000 Americans died population 328,000,000. since beginning pandemic, 99.998% Americans deadly covid-19 case. headline sound impressive.

However, put another way, headline tells us 0.001% vaccinated Americans died, Worldmeters tells us 0.0019% Americans died since beginning pandemic. That's 50% decrease. sounds impressive.

Be careful see statistics. really easy lie/mislead them.

Now numbers give completely fair comparison Worldometer numbers include deaths since beginning pandemic, point throwing numbers like 99.999% without context super misleading irresponsible.

However, believe single point negates overall argument. LPN RN generally vastly different levels education, clinical responsibilities. Furthermore, also disingenuous say RNs LPNs take NCLEX exam - not. Otherwise, would anyone LPN qualified nurse.

And finally, I'll attempt make point clear again. Despite legally appropriate call nurse LPN, disingenuous characterize something not. I'll grant legally call nurse, general public entirely different perspective nurses knowledge responsibilities versus LPN. Everyone knows nurse does, vast majority public even know LPN is. intentionally misleading. hope too, Delta infectious chicken pox, going need 92% vaccination rate start seeing infection rates decline toward 0 You’re wrong. tried Oregon, unfortunately really work spur vaccines. rates essentially completely plateaued weeks, Governor ended removing mask mandate early.

I highly doubt 40% people going quit jobs. unlikely. Oakland great mask mandates far, soon California mandate officially ended, significant minority people decided never wear mask again. Lots people r/bayarea view, average person Oakland done great job far know too. CDC currently lists US covid death count ~600,000. also lists death count everyone vaccine ~6000. 6000 death's deaths including covid, blood clots, old age, everything accident murder. MVP, Thanks link. specific reason pointing old people half Americans underlying conditions, then? Welp, rate, ranks thinned quite bit. That’s really sad :( I’ve really lost hope humanity past year half Florida bartender here. Same, except since April. seems odd would spike R0 3 R0 10-12. insanely high difference mutation? impression varies state. Wonder someone log toxic site accusing individuals. Probably obesity Ah. looking IVS. mistake.

Like, already health care providers conversations beloved families. we're extending circle frankly, African Americans particular, enough African American physicians us even conversation one-on-one everybody.  do. Damn whatever. Give hundreds dollars
 get selfish pricks vaccinated. 

Whatever works. none business waited long money either is. America. people ticketed punished know it. 

Give whatever, long get damn shots. time energy salty people anymore. 

I'd rather think ""Just let die"" Florida: hold beer. work print shop that's normally running two three massive presses time night.

It's quiet mouse building thanks pressmen getting coof. :/ think 99.996% give cite? Wishing best luck that! Thats also lot staying closed.

A good drive serve hundreds orders hour. Tables seat fraction that. Add people using place loiter really makes question worth it.  Half people brainwashed idiots individual decision take risks governments.

If willing make individual decision separate society live self-sufficient farm, means.

If willing make decision, you’re garden variety intellectually lazy asshole. I’m protein scientist, I’ve gotten used conversations morons past couple years.

It’s vaccine similar vaccines, new tech. you’re concerned spike protein accumulating places, I’d try awfully hard get COVID. do? globally.

In US, also generally, higher income means insulation risk - business big enough employee handbook/policy, probably contact public. probably infected people know killed almost none. seems like less big deal literally nobody know obviously gotten died it.

Countries poor familiar epidemics value vaccine. People known many people caught even died likely want vaccine, less able afford time work handle potential side effects. Americans believe pulling bootstraps   us government said legal percentage unvaccinated people hospitalized COVID last months? Bout time Lol cool, let know goes you. Mick Jagger wearing skin tight clothing age 75 dancing stage doesn’t scream “trying hard” lmao that's they're incorrect. significant majority population vaccine prevents disease entirely. minority vaccine prevent disease, disease experience significantly millder would experienced unvaccinated. every vaccine developed works. Even within family attitudes wildly different. dad literally looking clinical trials could last summer desperate get it, finally volunteered distribution, mom hesitant, got friends going wouldn’t go unless came them. people need experience COVID never learn Man, getting rid restrictions one thing (still wrong, least see governor conservative state would view restrictions politically bad thing implement), won’t even help hospitals handle surge? guess maybe don’t want seen acting like virus still serious issue (which is)? Abysmal. actually vaccines give sterilizing immunity (thus protecting getting disease). HPV vaccine, example, I'm sure we've ever anything like respiratory disease. Maybe day.... I'm AZ governor prevented mask mandates schools. school also ended online program, today first day homeschooling. pediatrician said without universal masking schools risk return vaccinated.  states among conservative, conservative states generally behind rest. 

Maryland higher percentage black people Alabama, almost much Louisiana. examples liberal states mentioned higher average amount black people vaccination. Nah. fine. hit target month ago Chicago

But hey gotta clutch pearls something right? nation unfortunately still believes pull bootstraps work hard minimum wage afford house.  I'm moron pick me!! bodies month sick hand, pretty sure reason relative got first shot yesterday he’s federal worker Biden going require it. Gladly. Yeah I'm sorry, lala *was* shit show terrible idea. think verified people's vaccination/covid statuses sorely mistaken. hope escorts get tested. Geez. Sorry, simply true. know personally many people tested positive covid symptoms vaccinated. lot people know this. pro vaccine, appears vaccine effective saying. Based what?  Yeah, first. outsider understand US understandable fear authoritarianism fear living society give shit members. Black people general mistrust government authority anything pushed believe politicians take advice scientist doctors say. republican q trash.

Stop talking like sides thing. fucking not. know yet Delta maintains chicken pox level infectivity rate children? lot people know young, healthy, anti-vax currently fighting covid. Choose battles wisely. Wish well. every right really worth complaining? Stop spread get back lives faster prolong it. Yeah, it’ll take time, that’s still basically saying last 30-50 years multiple bumps road every couple months we’re seeing now. no- life times. Yes! That’s want know! There’s mechanism opt religious health reason. usual. always get dinged auto mod mention states certain color. chance mutation evades vaccines coming mostly vaccinated population (vaccine escape) way higher random mutation making vaccines useless Masks necessary what? He's also British, healthcare free. paying UK tends best quality Possibly. Last time tried, 864,000 died. So... lot ground make want beat record. Bad target. much easier wear mask brief store visit, thus last place protest, first (Walmart wd ok account symbol &amp; power) Walmart mandated vaccines yesterday know, like, what?? got (Moderna breakthrough) it’s bad cold brain fog. Much preferable friend got pre-vaccine had. COVID taste like? good news, thank god. considering it, got hit

You count average American days care right thing personally effects them. depends when... CDC's guidance literally days ago vaccinated people need wear masks

Biden pissed mainstream media (rightfully) shaming CDC saying masks recommended really see could check that. like insurance companies gonna raid home looking soda bottles, candy, coffee beans. far lesser rate unvaccinated. think also due fact came back last place 1st stop effectively 50 qualifying laps catch overtake everyone got vaccinated still got coronavirus. symptoms mild. know I’m okay stop quarantining rejoin public? 10-12 days enough, more?   Provincetown highly vaccinated one might expect cases among vaccinated. Funny everyone Reddit breakthrough case promised return normalcy vaccination happened, made assumption 75-80% country would part get vaccinated… get line thinking lot people. A. vaccine probably would kept people getting fucked around let virus mutate uncontrolled.

B. vaccines necessarily keep getting it. Look flu shot. necessarily keep getting it, probably less severe. issue one struggled read comment? fortunately there’s less restrictive places eat better quality food mcdonald’s Expected Florida article place. First says less 1% headline, says .004% article (which sure that's less 1%, WAY less 1%, say is). goes imply they're simple division using 163 million vaccinated denominator, is... questionable best, disingenuous worst, totally misses many vaccinated people actually exposed virus, going small fraction 163 million. last least fact information numbers cumulative entire year since started vaccinating, really paints misleading picture current situation far seems case breakthrough infections becoming significantly common. 

I love good news vaccines kind dumb getting upvoted. Florida needs dose feeling Venn diagram people refusing get vaccinated people afford air travel doesn’t overlap much.  keep hearing news breakthrough cases (even mild) extremely rare, yet I’ve seen literally hundreds people Reddit post getting fully vaccinated. sort stuff that's scary people need see more. Co worker who's adamant he's getting vaccine worried side effects still weird bubble believes anyone strong immune system okay, see elite athletes way fitter overweight 55 year old struggle it, boggles mind think anyone would chance it. wave exactly Florida sunbelt states went around time last year, magnified Delta. Even highly vaccinated Northeast gonna see huge surge fall/winter Look Jacobson v Massachusetts  agree - haven’t hovering Nation 58% fully somewhere 8-12% returning dose number 2? people consider vaccinations end ICU covid. Yea well 30% problem constantly. Wish could move somewhere smarter like WA. Stuck FL, epicenter viral stupidity. That's disturbing. never heard I'm surprised. No, anger towards fact third fucking population intent acting fifth column active support fucking virus. He's wrong side virtually everything else. employees start masking earlier week someone asked today wearing again. 

I know, lady, maybe Louisiana highest cases per capita entire world? Nah. I’m Mississippi.

The vaccination rate 35% qualifying fully vaxed. mask wear rate generous estimate 5%.

We’re fucked. [My people need place sad many people still getting sick even vaccine............let's see long rational comment stays up...... Nobody... absofuckinglutely nobody... ever said can't get COVID vaccinated. That's vaccines work. Wow that’s lot flu cases /s. attacking people work grocery going help anybody? Eastern WA state. forgot side saying vaccine wonderful effective wear mask anyway vaccinated people could contagious.  That's side pisses off.  Looking Surgeon General.  you, Dr Fauci.

And CDC tracking unknown reasons.  Maybe really want know. Americans pandemic always ""me"" ""we"" concern. 

Actually, applies things folks. bodies familiarity virus. mutated virus likely disastrous outcome. thing setting herd immunity zero. encountered virus, period. I'm epidemiologist, know antibodies immune systems simple easily overcome. would radical mutation act say. Maybe right, right right now. delta+ variant.

The answer whatever believe. take care unvaccinated. credit, got vaccinated December pro-vaccine entire time. 😂👏 Reddit. stark disconnect real world often times especially COVID crisis. 

If saw consensus you’d think Black Plague societal fear equal March 2020. Agreed. Long term effects seen years months please change narrative considered standard point vaccine development approval pretend ok normal so.

I can’t really think instance long-term effects vaccine. Nat Geo article good discussion: effects don’t also show short-term effects would crazy, *vanishingly* unlikely would long-term effects aren’t likely occur disease itself.

Vaccine development usually takes long time it’s harder measure efficacy less widespread diseases, gathering information important delay fewer consequences. timeframe recently deployed Ebola vaccines wasn’t really much longer.

Bear mind also lot current vaccine development either developing *replacement* vaccines, means there’s high bar clear, developing vaccines tricky things like Dengue Zika antibody-mediated enhancement.

You pretend you’re “skeptic” whatever, based I’ve seen you’re pearl-clutching reactionary thinks inability think critically information you’re presented actually sophistication. Who, children 12 (grade schoolers middle schoolers)? Yes telling vaccinated vaccine available them. Thanks, ya guess that’s common sense says do. feel like bubble made us feel like tail end this. Realizing I’m maybe told whole truth people I’m supposed trusting. no....ANY employee. company finally put vaccine mandate week! think waiting see big corps would get backlash. Thankfully 🙏🏻 saying masks needed? Ironically, narrative aligns CDC. Good job? Fair!!! curious, take long get it? Surely age group offered months ago. Lol this. vaccinated people virus mild flu.

Oh well, maybe future better forms communication could help situations like this. then, thoughts prayers. Im guessing lot people ""concerned"" vaccine saw case count drop got smug thinking ""ha, avoid vaccine covid, Im smart 

I know multiple people thought this. slowly changing minds become apparent covid disappearing. Vaccine prevent infection, make like cold rather something would send hospital happen contract it. vaccine like wearing fullbody armor compared getting slashed shirt on. Yep. Funny thing auto mod ate first comment. guess compared making certain people wear masks making certain politician wear certain color hat. probably get downvoted hell, I’m going hold opinion anyway. school district test, accord. summer school, 700 students, unvaccinated vaccinated option wear masks. maintained cleaning standards, upgraded ventilation, social distancing, didn’t require masks. time, 2 students got infected. 2. 70% vaccination rate county. tested extremely recently, delta main concern. So, requiring masks. believe safe. Highschool sucks masks lol. Obviously doesn’t apply everywhere generally think it’s safe. take 🤷‍♂️ count south rising again? ^^ this
It’s important there’s still large percentage population isn’t eligible vaccination can’t vaccinated. people running around happy Larry like nothing wrong huge problem. haven’t read anything it’s good others. Implement anyway, sort court later. can't sit around wait mandate laws go appeals process. Yeah strikes pretty smart guy knows play base. said, I'm sure decided vaccine. pandering move would've downplay cast doubt. Meanwhile America even people imprisoned anywhere else earth still aren’t decent approaches public health. Inauguration crowd size Here’s question all, back talking respirators ? Since great deal us vaccinated, mask wear protect others us. seems concerned protecting others. ?? Today also final quarantine day! pizza lunch could actually taste again. also 30 spent 3 days ass. Can’t even imagine terrible would without vaccine. 

*high five* helpful statistic without number unvaccinated people. I.e., ""over time window, X% unvaccinated people previously infected experienced COVID infection"" largest decrease hesitancy January May education group high school education less. Hesitancy held constant educated group (those Ph.D.); May Ph.D.’s hesitant group. Wth wrong people? wear mask get it! Yeah tough part everyone 'safe' circle closed circle. say couple unmasked indoors parents friends. people 5-10 different people unmasked indoors us poor okay Considering half seemed dining room closed low staffing, big deal. haven’t eaten inside McDonald’s years anyway even COVID. rise vaccinations doesn’t seem significant seems slight.

I'm absolute terms, yeah, seem exciting. 

But %wise? last three weeks, looking nearly doubling 7 day average first doses administered.

And turn 3 weeks growth 4 5 6? That's things start really getting exciting. could. Right reaching hesitant network. That's going increase pressure/desire many harder reach guys.

It's like dominoes. We've pushed new set might still building. next 3 weeks pretty exciting watching data, imo. reminder, place discuss *policy* -- topic politics removed.

Wishing harm anyone result permanent ban subreddit. Keep civil. .... yet  Mask mandates always tied % vaccinated (e.g. masking longer mandatory say 60-70% vaccinated state), would've helped before. like policy ignoring burning embers full blown forest fires. Masks help prevent areas high COVID transmission occurring first place. describes states like Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, better vaccination rate places, including states low number POC. I’ve vaccinated 6,327 people far. 

Even though job (retail pharmacist) literally sucks life right now, I’ll never say “no” someone wanting vaccine.  get answer this, like, stat? identified among Massachusetts residents; vaccination coverage among eligible Massachusetts residents 69%

The CDC report identified 69% vaccinated.

btw, hope I'm coming across annoying. I'm trying fight anyone prove point. want understand protect myself, children. Sounds like something North Korea would do. apperently know cherry picking is. I'm reffering list 50 states. stripper gave vaccine behind curtain passed 2 hours felt warm happy 864k south died? less combined sides workplace put mandate today there's also religious health opt out. cleared HR, sure involves sounds like documentation needed. Mmhmm like screens calling office stupid! try that. wear mask every time go out. really sure N95 available public. Since last year shortage healthcare workers.

But let talk point. I've got list drugs thought OK really bad long-term side effects. know drugs common? inserting substances body alter way body chemistry works. 

This vaccine? not. vaccine *takes advantage* body chemistry works teaching body target eliminate invaders resemble COVID-19 virus. That's vaccines work.

You’re one doesn’t know they’re talking about.

You one doesn’t know you’re talking about, lol vaccinated? 70% excluding minors excluding 12? blame that. many straight refusing get vaccine, give people third booster doses expire. I'm Orange County expect mask mandate brought back unless Newsom orders entire state, seem want upcoming recall election. Fire them. guess town get memo.

So, guess I’m trying say is, zero respect, zero empathy, zero tolerance bullshit anti-vaxxer’s anti-masker’s spouting off. Don’t want either? Hope get what’s coming you. i'm sure say certain since many senators even say vaccinated Here's I've got majority-native counties:

It seems that, worst state general, worse counties fared. high enough % people sampled fully vaxxed. Again, town outbreak occurred very, high vaccination rate. 

If 100% people vaccinated, 100% cases would occur fully vaccinated people. 95% people vaccinated still possible majority infections could vaccinated people vaccine 90% effective. pretty much impossible draw efficacy data event without knowing vaccine coverage Mark words discussions ten years now, 

We won't. Unless referring future don’t many people don’t think important shocks me.

""Everyone's got plan get punched mouth"" comes mind. bother Mr there's 7000 variables much rather smart people steering boat see obstacles coming ""plan"" ignores things every virus central lives way.

You can't shove leasing cause death corner ignore it. still top 3 cause death much people want go away, won't. mean, obviously can't speak you, I've got list low cholesterol saturated fat foods fridge exercise quite frequently. I'm shoving heart disease corner. like dumb ass pig Mississippi,Alabama, Louisiana 81% serious disease. I’m tired propaganda tbh. undermines entire cause government intentionally omits information sway behavior American people.

I got vaccine. support getting vaccines. counted Covid cases based hospitalized would far fewer cases. need compare apples apples.

Since day one rather Machiavellian approach way data regarding Covid disseminated. huge issue causing mistrust (as should).

Give us data. Don’t interpret data misleadingly sway us. I’m it. Ok - showing state state lot fully vaccinated people still hospitalized dying COVID.. thought vaccine supposed keep us serious hospitalizations death. Selective service option. You’re required law register 30 days 18th birthday. describes states like Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Virginia, better vaccination rate places, including states low number POC. Stay mad bozo.

They want stupid people killing others around them. Sounds good. couldn’t 90 days lockdowns don’t see else would change American psyche haha. That’s awful, I’m sorry. believe can't deny coverage, probably raise premiums like smokers. Good move little brother. work mandating vaccines says working directly clients vaccinated. Lol what? would get shot order eligible draft? would make people inclined get it, comes benefit ineligible draft. you’re fully vaccinated. Congratulations decided grab life preserver. get moderna second set get broader coverage? Bringing home Covid killing parents going seriously mess lives kids. kids. doubt already happened. Huh, almost everyone personal responsibility. Seriously, anything better lives? Imagine time effort went something worthwhile **** want say I'm dumb fuck.

State run incompetent fools. 100% dumb stats, reason it’s stated like confuse people. What’s stat non vaccined? stated cuz would same… Get vaccinated can’t buy processed garbage? guess good, maybe get vaccinated eat real food. figure? Control age see percentage people severe complications vaccine existed. compare percentage now. fewer people severe complications vaccine presumably mitigating them. thought sinus infection starting Thursday last week. woke middle night feeling like gotten punched left side face. Started mild throat scratchiness earlier day. Dunno Delta surprise me. That’s you’re wearing PPE (hopefully), it’s exposure. need mandate federal level. States like TX Florida banned mask mandates local school districts. way masks happening school starts two weeks issue Executive Order.  “Low risk letter” Awww. family anti-vaxxes together, dies together.  think major reason many people U.S. sought vaccination. Also apparently fear mRNA changing person's DNA? looking information vaccines reason emphasis ""It alter DNA"". even thought that. I'm concerned DNA. would CDC place put much emphasis that? bought thermometer thought maybe would get fever. I'm wondering maybe genetic code hacked. Haha. call bullshit. work KP contractor FTE innumerable COVID planning meetings last 18 months, less. got particular email today. 

KP cult, individual people whole range beliefs like large population humans. organization, admire KP responding crisis.

I idea mean “milking guys.” That’s non sequitur sure… lol Send doses poorer countries along Americans get vaccine yet, let come back take vaccine.

Nah, I'm kidding. let come back all. Ya think read wrong entirely see difficulty understanding.

I saw random sample infected, total infected 469, random sampling, that’s first disconnect.

To though, I’m wrong, vaccine stating 96% efficacy, wouldn’t infected sampling demonstrate substantially lower number?

Out 469, 74% fully vaccinated. 

That’s 2/3rds.

Shouldn’t number like, 4%? bet that's like fast food worker's equivalent working home office workers. Great news! Hope lots same. all, may infection, get tested talk doctor. Oh, get started. I'm trying avoid local news feeds ignorance runs deep here. new variant *can* spread vaccinated, 1/8th likely get COVID form (asymptomatically symptoms) spread it. get it, vaccinated seem capable unvaccinated spreading COVID-19, less symptoms warn risk. 

So, no, vaccinated much danger vaccine available people vaccine. 

I confused yesterday. vaccinated people still expected resistant transmitting COVID unvaccinated still less likely get - even Delta variant, even asymptomatically. Oh shit, read ""ice cream broccoli soup A1"".

Cause would fucking insane.  news one East Bay area school district recently returned person learning promising. 11-school Brentwood district confirmed least 15 positive Covid cases among students staff three days new school year.

This fearmongering nonsense, since contact tracing showed cases school opened. example school transmission used one Thanks, message mod he/she able help well. appreciate time suggestion. Thank much! company printed lanyards, super visible easy enforce. first week two needed light reminders keep masks on, issues since then. rule even vaccinated, leave lanyard home required mask up.

That's fine, we'll serve unvaccinated customers long take covid test negative. way, unless there's documented medical condition preventing vaccinated 12, covid test accept anal test China Working it!    trends UK indicate this. likely worse US due lower vaccination rate per age group, I'm hopeful. Hopefully avoid getting wave, though since I'm vaccinated I'm worried. exact symptoms exact timeline…


Fuckin awesome…..  might want consider asking r/coronavirusmn local perspectives. pretty active sub. ""doctors believe 1-year-old son also suspected positive""


When doctors sure 1-year-old suspected positive?  ugh sorry hear happened mom glad she’s well now. glad able avoid getting taking care her. 

the virus really strange. infectious didn’t know - came contact 18 friends (well friends friends don’t many) tested negative. maskless crowded bar too. bizarre although i’m glad didn’t get it! 99.9999%? Damn son could lottery instead defying odds (if stat based reality is) Look limbic system impairment dynamic neural retraining system. think really helpful Age breakdown COVID deaths Minnesota? Check out: chart midway specify state, age ranges want look at. Timely commentary classic Python Twist….Let’s see judges scores! Solid 9’s toss 7 Russians! brilliant effort! fault. CDC media left children high dry. Governments almost always fail people. become big, far removed everyday citizen. forget came from, represent. strange politicized.

It's like hearing someone say ""well, know Earth flat, politicized."" Thank you! first source numbers dont add up. bunch accounted for, know used me. 

Ill see find 2nd link. Thanks time, really appreciate effort Ill work using links. Thank  That’s evidence.

That’s anecdote someone doesn’t know vaccines work they’re supposed do.

Go back reading RT ""articles"" watching Faux News.

You’re hopeless anyways.  think point though, tell people invincible thought become involved high risk activities Provincetown. going stores unmasked spending time around brother unvaccinated kids thinking able spread disease. seems untrue wish info stated often I'm pretty surprised it. Bc listen orange guy’s big lies. Besides, vaccines available back then. Try survey sample 150 practicing PCPs 150 practicing specialists. 

19% North East
20% Midwest 
34% South
27% actual numbers likely won’t 96%. Could more, could less. said, they’re still likely way waaaay higher general public higher medical professionals much less training biology virology (nurses, EMTs, etc). Hi shithead, here's evidence you. I'll take ""ok guess know hell talking about"" Look chronic fatigue syndrome CDC website; also goes can’t remember stands for.... it’s understood suite physiological dysfunctions including auto-immune reactions occur post-viral syndrome— long-covid compared now... one hand, CFS finally get researched properly hope proper treatments sure taken decades &amp; global pandemic draw attention issue post-viral morbidity completely destroys lives. Fauci drawn comparison too. also check clinical trials recent promising treatments CFS &amp; likely tested long covid too. Well, sort yes, sort no. 

Asthma nasty. I'm asthmatic myself. true COVID hits people asthma harder. vaccine taught body deal it. Delta variant, despite impacted vaccine, managed make breakthrough cases - defined vaccinated person getting sick becoming infectious regardless. Please note vaccine still reduces severity illness. 

So, really, risk game. members family can't get vaccinated yet, asthma respiratory conditions would make likely severe symptoms? no, mother ***is probably*** overreacting. concerned - COVID significant risk organ damage, since Delta variant particularly infectious, existing respiratory condition, there's non-zero chance hit hard. Again, chance drastically reduced vaccine, still present. 

If members family respiratory conditions, mother likely trying protect family. one catches it, whole family probably will. 

With said, 17 years old. verge legal adult. scary thing, good relationship her, need talk mother this, almost-adult talking adult. right request reasoning actions. mention, due state law cannot ask proof vaccination. basically honor system.

Source: IU system. reporting vaccination status upload photos card, week made mandatory vaccinated found require proof, changed checkbox verifying fully vaccinated, option upload card *I think* chance prize? Interested see right work states handle Plenty SF people hate Oakland Feels like true areas though seems like pretty common knowledge well. I've never seen anyone like surprised get covid shot practically whenever wherever want. know area signs place ""vaccine available here, appointment"" etc. OP said county, country… “Mild” medical parlance means case doesn’t require hospitalisation. still worst illness life.

If you’re hospitalised, *at minimum* need oxygen. that’s logical division. GOP conservative media spent months demonizing vaccine. Blood hands. exactly ass since two examples: UK India. intent deter vaccination simply point end one way another. doubt covid stay we'll getting updated vaccines years. Immunity accrue peaks severity diminish accordingly. reporting breakthrough infections reported state level analyzed KFF.

Says right article. went text messsges friends varying backgrounds. general consensus May 2020, end sight. Mostly government media pushing “flatten curve” theory. 

I think government pushed short term thinking knew people would never accept long term lockdown/disruption knew coming. 

You also appreciate that, aside TINY number people, one would ever predicted pandemic would look like this. either pictured zombie apocalypse massive threat putters out. dont like sort compromise. government wants pay lots health care without conditions, thats onething, personally, im vast majority important medical care. wierd compromise, still almost private insurance, things like wont let market based industry....leave private industry ever decide wont impose sort rules on, taxes pay ever think shouldnt impose conditions on.  Global supply chain issues guess Delta much, much infectious Covid version previously, requires higher vaccination number curb infections. Yes, misleading. [source simply taking Number Fully Vaccinated People Diagnosed COVID-19 / Total Number Fully Vaccinated People state. Piedmont, orinda, Lafayette, San Ramon, Pleasanton, near Oakland million times better Oakland lol yes Antioch shithole. It’s basically diet oakland Oakland’s little cousin. They’re pretty much man. guess 70 percent teen good. Friends would walk school feast nuggets lmao Logistics I'd imagine. Shipping vaccine easy going FedEx, UPS, DHL saying ""ship (insert country)"" Back 2004, apparently 27%.   2 weeks! Wait hold on...  allow editorialized titles! post title match article title exactly. hope so. believe 1918 pandemic, 2nd wave worst one, would Delta case think? can’t think city near Oakland even worse Oakland. you’re city must shithole too. Oakland least good food, music venues, etc. anyone bay hates Oakland probably concord Napa, even worse… Antioch. ""We'll sacrifice economy"" ""Keyword"" [why can't compare Covid-19 also went post history half comments literally telling redditors Chinese vaccines terrible sorry skeptical. I’m Christian I’ve couple person services since beginning pandemic. Even though I’ve fully vaccinated since March.

I can’t see Christ-like meet 350 people, wearing masks, social distancing there’s active pandemic.

That’s loving neighbor. Many would say it’s living fear going it’s responsible. live high risk father likely wouldn’t survive case covid.

The pastor church told (he’s 45?) isn’t going get vaccinated thinks he’s healthy enough virus wouldn’t make sick.

There several outbreaks church, recent high school summer camp 15+ tested positive spread don’t know many.

It’s starting get ridiculous. makes say chance breakthrough infection low? That's said months ago we're seeing really uncommon understand. sure reelected though believe people say would primaried even crazy person acted rationally.

This Texans killing themselves. better go cross brand? thought saw somewhere may better get Moderna booster Pfizer first 2 Pfizer Moderna first. Maybe I'm thinking AZ Moderna like Canada? Anyone insight source even? rum won’t drink it’s delicious can’t more. R8 believable, that's high value. would mean reach herd immunity threshold 85-90% population achieved partial immunity.

I know believe estimates put 10. No, shouldn't, article based KFF analysis state-reported breakthrough cases, CDC breakthrough hospitalization data.

The headline absolutely correct source data cited article. probably fans got vaccinated saw NFL mandating players. Power media higher risk responsible well legally adult. parents overprotective kids find burden. sometimes know things know, traumatic experiences feel duty protect from. Maybe high risk too, want burden bringing home virus carry rest days.

I'm sure frustrating. mother loves you. Try patient. plenty time daredevil soon.  inexcusable US send doses abroad. 

What hold up? Delta Wave bonus round carnival game would want play. article yesterday said Florida hospital, 20 percent patients vaccinated. Thankfully, 1 55 icu. got downvoted bunch merely pointing part article everyone commenting on. That's good. true behavior must change. Yes. Except bit high. Current number 0-18 deaths severe comorbidities. 

About 10% yearly motor vehicle death That’s ridiculous though. don’t car? can’t use drive through. least - offer counter orders outside. What’s crazy want keep *job* worth hundreds thousands lives probably want open vial you, use 9 doses 6 hour period wasted. lot outpatient clinics volume make readily available without advanced planning. ""emphasizes path forward relies personal responsibility rather government mandates.""

Translates to: own, suckers! Unbelievable post way intending comprehensive every single high risk person. problem lies underfunding. people Spain earn quite low salaries consequently contributions system quite low. healthcare costs magically less countries. supplies still cost etc. Spain needs sort economy. trying set new business. It’s incredibly hard due amount paperwork done lack easily available information. business Germany find information online. 

To Start company Spain need 4000 euros bank. 1000 fees paying accountant it, 3000 prove funds. young people supposed create start requirements? wonder big black money economy. Everyone asks table money. understand why. make way hard work legally. apparently know cherry picking is. ""Look 50 states instead one city"" I'm actually saying. unfortunate. mean need 10x cases make fair.

and mentioning us vaccines? us still worse get caught brought back globally!

most countries also new variant Japan yet detected, would also bad :(

this could apply international travel people guests house.

i dont think athletes it, olympic bubble protect athletes staff japanese public false. said trust Trump's word alone. say would trust Donald Trump would credible source information talks efficacy reliability whatever he's talking American conservatives, part, give conservatism bad name, worse deserves purely theoretical grounds.  already manipulated whole southern strategy, worse rural radio, fox news, breitbart russian bots.  especially poorly built handle misinformation.  sides pretty bad, American least, regards adopting parties majority feelings own, feeling incredulous it. US always best vaccines large countries. Why? US keeping vaccines giving countries Texas fool power fine place puts mask requirements place. Oakland fucking trash can. Source, live half hour spend many work day Oakland. It’s mostly fucking dumpster clean spots. It’s overpriced dumpster. According CDC data, 58% hospitalizations children 8 month long 2019-2020 flu season US last 16 months COVID (52.4k vs 33k).  would look whole lot worse home US tell someone ran out. there's extra workplace medical/religous exemption flu shot process put policy mandate Covid vaccine. multiple people use religous exemption going forward, believe use m/r exemption required wear mask presence others peak periods positivity progressive levels disciplinary action failure wear one. Vaccinated employees paid pandemic pto get sick Covid, non-vaxxed use accrued PTO. Lol Obama sucked ass governing too, quit thinking Dems give shit anymore republicans Good move. Thank you. Ist reasonable banned shopping, bars, plane bus travel etc. feel like it’s know wouldn’t really need wearing masks everyone got vaccinated. I’ve hardly met anyone likes wearing them, it’s discomfort necessary prevent others hurt. pretty fucking annoying currently go discomfort share country people won’t get shot. number counties might best metric use. Texas Georgia states counties overall nation (254 159, respectively). Arizona 15 counties. Gerrymandering, voter pool manipulation, bribery, outright fraud well recognized aspects House Commons England late c18. 

The reform bill 1832 was, part, clean worst it. Can't get around paywalls. Wow. Try kill kids stalker. makes fucking livid. friend doctor died 28 last year pulled shit last surge. would quit Believe me, “The Government” wanted “put things” body, could pretty much will, wouldn’t need anything convoluted vaccine. fact, historically entity could keep private industry putting things like tetraethyl lead people’s brains.

And scientists (read, me) bureaucrats seem scared pretty gleeful getting vaccine.

Let very, very, clear this: you, people like you, monsters. antisocial behavior marveled history. goal around 70% US population *fully* vaccinated order us considered herd immunity. 

This good news reached percentage number 1st dose, bodes well hopefully similar number fully vaxxed weeks' time.

Also Delta tearing across country vaccine skepticism all-time high, see positive development. Britain built vaccine manufacturing capacity scratch funding plants Netherlands contributing significantly COVAX.

Nothing stopped Korea Korea’s manufacturing capabilities anything greater deindustrialised Britain.  think bit nuanced two anecdotal stories. Mine thrived, also 12. I'd imagine, home life, siblings, quality virtual programs, obviously personality going play part.

Our district surveyed kids virtual programs mental health liked virtual school. basically said liked it, missed real gym class, happy. That's experience, I'm sorry poor, I'm glad better. going smart enough survive covid? I’m glad ended getting vaccine that’s took? It’s genuinely fucking sad.

For people, kind psychological tricks work much, much better delivering various scientific facts.

To people, tell ""It's Trump got."" people, takes seeing friend getting really ill covid.

The effect relating person's experience powerful. basic idea here.

Actually, think even scientific facts work well people partially people feel part ""team science"" way relate people. even though, see large restaurants/bars, etc masks everyone's fine. Hell, every chef/cook know mask kitchen wearing mask hot-ass space like fucking stupid.  yet people flying actual store bought trump/desantis 2024 flags homes here. We’re doomed. "" think could happen me."" angry people. people reason mutation spreading like wildfire shortage hosts. reason backsliding rapidly. We’re keeping kid home too. worth risk. willing play Russian roulette kids’ health. Thankfully, school district continue offering virtual learning. I’m also considering starting little pod kids age meet outdoors park like week little bit socialization. could PE lol Canada statute limitations, though?  worked Texas hospital would seriously consider striking least moving away Texas. flipping way would EVER live there.  maybe weren’t exposed virus?

Best way check look superspreader events. many vaccinated ones weren’t? gets closer % breakthroughs would happen.

With delta variant, there’s much higher chance “breakthroughs “. Also AZ also disappointed/bewhildered Ducey’s reckless actions, especially making illegal districts send kids exposed Covid home. switched daughter distance learning. I’m sure age kids district, heard parents mention Litchfield district made distance learning program available people outside district. Might take look. Also, good caring keeping kids safe. Google'd actually turns right. Ranked one healthier breakfast sandwich options major chains. that... man face manslaughter charges. anti-vaxxers perpetuating self fulfilling prophecy. enough people get vaccinated, virus mutates, evades vaccine protection. ""see told work!!"" *Facepalm* worry soon enough government tell put body body. wont make decisions wont take responsibility anything life since decided you. love it, I'm sure. Give politicians free hand handle pandemic ever want I'm sure what's best instead serving interests, history full examples bureaucrats caring sacrificing common good. like talking 5 year old. family reunion next week. People flying driving city attend. husband going Covid, parents going, hosting family house week. guarantee people going get sick one wearing mask. Agreed. honestly feel like I’m water boarding gym running. It’s horrible. mean like didn’t recommend AstraZeneca anyone 60 government said “If you’re 60/not otherwise eligible, you’re option AstraZeneca foreseeable future.” Good times. 

I mean would take vaccine commissions recommendations strictly recommendations point. Like pregnant, I’d get vaccinated healthy 13 year old, I’d get vaccinated even though neither things officially recommended. thanks bad advice override public health messages ""freedom"" anti-masking anti-vaxx propaganda. Anyone getting booster? It’s 6 months since 2nd shot Pfizer I’m thinking going CVS get moderna shot. I’m going lie, delta surging 6 months concerning. good see places actually enforcing 'vaccinated people' mandates helping tide little. Finally, good fucking news. course!

About go sleep now! :) I’m hard time buying statistic, bc I’ve seen nothing contradicting low numbers recently. lost haze woke speech Make economic. Tax credit vaccination.

Cheaper health insurance vaccinated.

Hospitalizations paid insurance. main argument “I still need wait see” crowd potential “adverse effects years now”. argument sounds really good taken face value that’s exactly problem. many people think beyond face value unfortunately High level summary:

* 21 28 people infected
* 13 vaccinated 
* vaccinated underlying conditions hospitalized pay tests IMO, enough fucking around  Go pharmacy. Lie age. don’t check ID. another thread someone said officials tried USA open shooting would probably break out. Preprint servers platforms researchers share work progress. work peer reviewed yet published.

The aim preprint sites help reasearchers sneak peek groups working on.

Only handful submissions servers eventually reviewed scientific journals deemed good science published. non-vaxxers got sick Covid. news? back January smell cigarettes time smell rotting meat poop. think won. Egg McMuffins kill you.

Nope.

Lol got shot told still right nothing said would ever change mind. I'm fine leaving now. Thank much explaining! Much appreciated! see graphic now. WTF happening 0-4, increase hospitalization? 5-11 looks like they're pretty good moment, great news. Regardless, NYC testing everyone get vaccinated. Hopefully inconvenience, quarantine days hopefully serious illness and/or death convince people get it. Hopefully decide get volition due understanding medical experts saying. wasn’t media, ceo pfizer.

I sure incentive towards selling doses lol think government trying make start culture little better changing laws, it’s going hard get people main goal life find job working big company government. people actually want work made hard. source please? Took brief look worldometers, according didn’t even many cases deaths period week. Honestly it’s unvaccinated people fueling pandemic…I think it’s right move require vaccine mask tested weekly MedRxiv website publish health studies they've published medical journal, like Lancet, New England Journal Medicine.

There several websites like various fields, starting arXiv (for physics) early 90s. They're called preprint servers, arXiv actually predates web.

These preprint servers great, get academics quick, free access studies. they're lightly moderated, media pick studies, lose context, give sense much confidence studies deserve. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

The word intubated worries. anyone 2 braincells rub together knew antivaxers first take masks hell half wearing anyway. covid back June 2020 vaccines came (i’m fully vaxed now) 22, means healthy active girl. bad. commission least month misery. brain fog bad idea going on. think took like
4 months fully recover. sickest ever life said claim **mostly** true, performance two boroughs contradict all. said claim **mostly** true, performance two boroughs contradict all. Oh no, possible way prevent outcome reading article title meaningless. often means one two things. Either 90% effective hospitalization 90% effective symptoms. First thing student learns stats class describe statistic words! 90% effective.... effective what??? Waring vampires? Reducing bad breath? Increasing lean muscle mass? letting society’s dumbest people hold us hostage

This pissing bad. Likely both, well vaccinated people hospitalised.

From February July majority deaths form vaccinated people, that's something like 95% vulnerable people vaccinated. dang thought rhinoviruses. Never mind New York done better states, also among liberal. Students get automatically locked using student Id numbers school. Can’t go school can’t log learning management system. please provide source? agree. husband went family gathering (I stayed home) people unvaccinated got covid. mom vaccinated tested positive. We're vaccinated luckily tested negative. many many viruses cause ""colds"". Including coronaviruses, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, RSV, adenovirus etc. Well, received vaccine study still got covid, 0% effective preventing symptomatic covid you. 

I think asking is, *would vaccinated people get covid study repeated?* think know answer question, probable vaccinated people likely get covid, get covid every time study repeated. would physiological (poor response immune system), would environmental (live area harder hit covid job likely expose virus), would behavioral (more likely choose expose virus). Obviously luck plays role, also. 

That's looking preventing symptomatic covid, though. Even among people vaccine ""failed"" (eg person got sick), may prevented getting sick. Including person posted comment, several comments say vaccines aren’t working aren’t effective people panic claims lockdowns back.

OP’s comments full misinformation fear mongering allowed sub. Perhaps excited thought family members ill? hate them?

Have ever gotten flu vaccine before? perhaps MMR? said member government political party [supports antivaxxers Nice hypocrisy there. group immunocomprimised people risk too! grandma can’t get vaccine actual medical reasons - virus around compromised is. sad see final years become closed state touts Libertarian, fairly Authoritarian position hold.  Seems norm dictate private business allow. suppose one ""it's real affects me"" dingbats. What, wearing masks indoors? recent delta surge killing conservatives finally time change course. Weaklings. France may general anti-vax sentiment may also louder, still [higher uptake Covid vaccine, passing US week ago still started flatten like many western countries. absolutely could fire bs reason, like could quit bs reason. at-will contract either party could terminate time. Lots stores, including walmart, shut Oakland. There's reason this.  Many many cities better Oakland. OP pro lockdown zero covid seriously believes vaccines effective simply ""better nothing"" surprised think possible. Expertise fake IDs? anyone would need pen. Plus, acceptable ""proof vaccination"" often includes photos and/or copies vaccine cards. get vaccinated… again? get correct Dead vote thing, mostly voters. Oakland bad. Oakland bad. San Francisco, part equitable distribution meant prioritizing access hard-hit minority zip codes. areas given vaccine access first. local vaccine sites. door-to-door drives. still zip codes lag.

Yes, vaccine hesitancy. explain hesitancy, surely exists. clearly true named states. Another example Delaware, right behind Louisiana. it’s whatboutism, it’s totally relevant argument. 

Society risk tolerance everything. You’re right children died anti vaxxers resistance masks. denying that. 

But doesn’t change fact covid extremely, extremely, extremely unlikely seriously injure kill anyone age 18, delta variant included. 

Like said above, society acceptable level risk everything. point previous comment children die per year drownings motor vehicle accidents children died covid. also preventable deaths. don’t stop letting children swim putting cars we? Even though would prevent deaths. 

Why? society whole accepts level risk associated performing tasks. eventually, society accept level risks covid poses children society whole, virus endemic never going go away like many sub believer. point retail restaurant ppl need ability carry...wanna play stupid ass game win stupid ass prizes. 🎯 CDC director fired McDonald's CDC director done first place. (e g. masks areas high vaccination rates) Oh, good stop acting like theres pandemic keep appearances deep state? miss part comment pointed many international students don’t luxury access vaccines? takes least month become fully vaccinated many countries, student-age people don’t yet access vaccines, best might gotten one dose only. Vaccines work get arm give body time needs build immunity; good chunk classmates opportunity time classes start. Masks get chance would help, especially since classrooms fully packed always well-ventilated (not mention many live dorms/with roommates).

The strange anti-mask arguments confuse precautions fear always strike insecure, childish even. Going diapers like downright Freudian though, lol… don’t even know what’s appropriate reaction stuff like anymore. It’s like delta plus August 2021 “strain month”. would question % surrounded counties, South, 29% barely 31% vaccinated people.   


Of course, dn't know arrived 70% though. question is, studies showing scholastic achievement students online school student's person? know grades attendance wayyy last year. However, much due living stressful pandemic vastly increases rates stress, burnout, mental illness much online education? Chances pretty high even going back school enviornment going lead decreased scholastic achievement. Without knowing much hard weigh risk reward going back person surge. mean, vaccines even 100% infections original variant, point vaccines never stop getting sick stop getting hospitalized dying, even know suggesting even possible considering millions people even gotten first dose.

(70% many *adults* *one dose*) Vaccinated no? curious True, although factor naturally acquired immunity. US 30% people previously infected, even assume half went get vaccine, we'd sitting around 65% form immunity. probably saw massive reduction throughout spring. actually reach herd immunity threshold previous variants covid. Delta though, 65% nearly enough. I've seen estimates 90% needed. able get second shot? That's nuts. think would ever feel comfortable treated someone believe basic scientific facts hell delta plus? know it’s apocalypse start adopting Apple level branding viruses. Sounds like might anxiety too. controlling strict parents like might want tread lightly broaching subject could hit nerve end. obviously cares ton level might also fear anything happened you, wouldn’t able handle it. That’s usually theme overprotective parents :) would blame etc. Controlling every move alleviates anxiety. something keep mind talk her. go asthma/allergy doctor? Sounds like asthma pretty controlled maybe mom could start assessing risks doctor. random person internet opinion, think it’s terrible idea lay low couple weeks thing blazes U.S. get better data. ah divided multiply 100. Good catch! 50% population fully vaccinated, far short need herd immunity. Antivaxers cause this. Make union cover cost testing sick time teacher doesn’t get vaxx’d Kids aren’t immunocompromised allowed partake activities vaccinated adults. It’s ridiculous debate. feel badly teachers going deal parents refusing let kids get vaccinated wear masks. healthcare professionals Florida true damn heroes. fathom staying there. 50% population fully vaccinated. US expat NZ, first time since Feb 2020 I’ve felt optimistic US finally getting shit together covid. didn’t think bs disinformation campaigns would reach 70%

No way get 80 anything 70 huge difference. 

Fuck assholes put everyone else around danger. I’d like come back visit family mom passes. Selfish fucking morons. would mean 96.6% protection hospitalizations 98.4% deaths, pretty damn good me, also see deaths comorbidities, usually people fully vaccinated died old health problems represent general population. 50.2% Americans fully vaccinated. Well bleach supposed smell horrific Yeah indications could possibly issue. state defunded distance learning altogether. even option. I'm livid. Because, absolutely right. taste problem lasts way get covid ton people. Months many, year+ rare unlucky friend died. Good job keeping comment out. want people get vaccinated unbrainwashed. part problem 50% Americans fully vaccinated. far short need herd immunity. antivaxers ruining everything rest us. Billions people access vaccines, let get shots first, would say. 4% 1.6% actually still pretty damn good! 96% hospitalizations 98.4% death bad,thats well within sadly contemplated infections deaths plus lot vaccinated people died full comorbidities represent general population (I know someone fully vaccinated died, morbidly obese diabetic amputations diabetes controlled). Awesome! According Dr. Fauci percentage points away herd immunity!!  Georgia school started today, masks optional. kids spending another year virtual/ homeschool. find ironic schools meant teach critical thinking aggressively ignorant. ironic thing that?

*Pulling bootstraps*

Was term originally meant impossible... bootstraps connected boots...so idea literally cant impossible.

But people dumb days use term mean literally opposite lol make charity concert. Entry free get vaccinated than. show second vaccination get charged 500 USD credit card.

They even use California example large Hispanic population example, California, 30% vaccinations gone Hispanic people, account 63% cases, 48% deaths, 40% total population state.

And really want stress nowhere paper data show anyone Antivaxx. data shows minority groups less likely given vaccine. Honestly, data great either. goes public state records quite holes them. 

Look figure 2 moment, graph shows Cases, Deaths, Total Population states data from. even recorded percentages cases based racial groups. Georgia, Alaska, New York, others even data percentage cases made white people let alone Black Hispanic groups.

Your source even claims data incomplete figure 3 though completeness race/ethnicity data improved states since March 1. states declines shares vaccinations unknown missing race, states, like Arizona, experiencing particularly large declines, falling (36% vaccinations unknown race 11%).

In Discussion section, article even says data provide useful insights, also remain subject gaps, limitations, inconsistencies limit ability get complete picture getting vaccinated. 

The article also concludes statement states high shares vaccinations missing race/ethnicity, limiting ability interpret data. example, Washington D.C., 28% vaccinations among people classified “unknown.” Three states reporting vaccination data race/ethnicity. Comprehensive standardized data across states vital monitor ensure equitable access take vaccine.

This interesting read bit worrying misunderstood article easy do. article linking data show anything anti-vaxxers disparity racial groups. reason given would gap even data shown shows gap closing rather rapidly.

I hope charged every covid test. People lie vaccinations, know. Also aren’t threatened, advised. There’s key difference. Also delta variant affects things too. ok told got vaccinated risk would nil would ‘safe’ going forward. now, i’m going say that’s totally right — article indicates still risk. however, understandable that, due messaging, people throwing caution wind embracing life again. also don’t blame — it’s rough 18 months. people article right thing vaccinated. anger would better placed towards giving poor messaging perhaps anti-vaxxers.

Yeah, I'd rather take stats anecdotes.  credible source ever said risk would nil.
just like one would say risk dying car crash nil wear seatbelt.

if vaccinated elderly person needs hospitalized e.g. heart condition infected mostly asymptomatic nurse coughs immediate vicinity, still good chance might die despite fully vaccinated. 
there much body take. anyone aware health conditions make vulnerable towards severe disease death. current covid vaccines provide perfect protection, goat Tom Brady perfect super bowl record. mean best got.  expired 12-31-20 know excess food millions starve death? also know donating food wouldn’t change that, there’s root cause issues? Great, join UN political theatre. That's frustrating. personally know six people recently COVID. Two children therefore unvaccinated.

However, two debilitated enough able work week, people fully vaccinated. cases, seems fully vaccinated people ones caught first, symptoms developed later others households.

I'd rather tried try all. Whats point? point dont fucking end hospital wishing got vaccine  match People know statistics.

They even lie make COVID scary people think. mortality rate US something like 0.6% according CDC burden estimates. extrapolated world wide estimates something like 0.3%.

I find numbers extremely reassuring vaccinations working number going plummet even further. know two dozen people Alabama aged 21-30 went either Auburn, UA, State— none vaccinated. going interesting sure. Much transmissible original variant, lot people vaccinated, Chinese vaccines kind suck. anyone number current percentage people hospitalized vaccinated/unvaccinated? fuck US stop using masks already?

Ridiculous Vaccinated people spread delta much unvaccinated people. fuq would get vaccinated then? didn’t get first place. Never show symptoms. Never get flu shots, never get sick. Im tired overweight bums telling health meanwhile they’re reason population damn weak lazy lockdown. irony unbearable hate here, go find hobby please. difference science true whether believe not.

I think mistaken think elderly going get ill die long term disability Covid. It’s coming home kid looks like mailman?

Not think much better solution, possible restaurants lead spread still infeasible. Great post. I'm native English speaker clear enough understand properly. helpful. Thank you. Belgium is...

Altho sending AZ doses covax countries. actually quite easy.

Serological data suggests variant population rates hospitalizations deaths change.

And remember rates absolute numbers. delta virulent like suspect people die, mean rate death goes up, larger population infections.

Heck, delta could easily less deadly infects people appears deadly all.

But right know delta populations we're looking rates change significantly. Get vaxxed. ones die anti-vax/masks. one said that, think lot people assumed. Like got flu vaccine, think would okay least I’m sad (and slightly denial) hear turning endemic. truly think could avoided people better vaccinated actually abused simplest covid safety measures Scotland too. We're lucky cause directly affected UK Government  that's point, innit? Delta leads breakthrough go eating restaurant meet family, accept it, want live live recluse years. accept getting common cold every couple months all. what’s realistic worst case scenario delta variant? Repeat February 2020? hand what’s best case scenario (USA wise)? See, say that, I'm afraid fall/winter surge move inside turn heaters winter :( Everything meant hypothetical situation consciously deciding get vaccine would practical. Relax. hermit woods. chill. Remember unless absolute numbers high, higher percentage people infected vaccinated good.

That seems counterintuitive, according Bayes theorem probability need account populations probability occurs. 100% cases vaccinated people that'd mean everyone vaccinated absolute number cases would lot lower.

Just always remember comparing percentages vaccinated unvaccinated people need account rate population whole actually understand anything relevant. meant identify nurses internet - jump social media post ""I'm nurse vaccination kills people"". clearly intending give impression level expertise education have. apologize point clear.  There's actually coverage that! Probably applies large employers Totally agree. makes sense pissed CDC removal mask mandate. time clearly correct thing do. 

The valid counter argument known (and probably know) ended, never going come back - therefore perhaps ended situation constantly evolving, lo behold comes delta shifts whole equation. although that's valid point, really strong practical argument. Americans group BARELY ""tolerating"" covid restrictions hair's width along. Public sentiment damn near unanimous shit want normal lives back. realistic it, really, expect upheld mask mandate face situation ground? realistic all. made move could. That’s incorrect.

The rain began. neighbors evacuating said “hey! Come us! river overflow!” “I’m religious man, pray. God protect me.”
The rains continued, water rose began seeping house. man boat came by. “Come boat! Let save you!” “I’m religious man, pray. God protect me.”
And rain continued. Soon man roof. helicopter came by. “Grab hold rope, pull safety!” “No no. I’m religious man, pray. God protect me.”
The man drowned. got heaven demanded see God. “God! religious man! prayed! didn’t protect me?!”
God looked man said, “I sent radio report, neighbors, boat, helicopter. mean didn’t protect you? hell even here?” pretty clear empathy full stop. coworker like too. I’m angry worried her. easy.

LA county reported 1891 confirmed breakthrough infections, 171 hospitalizations 19 deaths. Seems 5-10% chance requiring hospitalization end breakthrough infection 1% chance dying. surveillance breakthrough cases poor, suspect number breakthrough cases higher real breakthrough fatality rate somewhere 1% .001%, likely much higher 0.001%. numbers cite closer overall risk, however, find situation lot COVID cases communities, individual risk breakthrough infection associated risks start go up. Two papers need bold text people's heads breakthroughs among vaccinated populations: 
 
1) - study May Alpha variant showing vaccines reduce chance severe symptoms ~2/3 **if manage contract it** 
2) - study later showing Delta variant notable reduction effectiveness vaccines. suggests reduction severity disease vaccinated people ~half 2/3. 
 
The best part vaccines reduction overall transmission. Unfortunately we're seeing breakthrough clusters vaccine + pre-pandemic behavior sufficient stop growing slope cases.

Distrust science, government, medecine political cultural lot people along ride part respective group. understand covid tests vaccines 'free', wears cost treatment? thought vaccines worked? ""older"" adult went back college 18-21s...I feel you. glad fully online student now. probably would taking semesters Covid issues lol change mind family member needs emergency surgery oh wait beds….. strikes COVID discussion America seems polarized - lack better word - emotional. 

From I've heard health experts country COVID big risk kids, including longer term symptoms. Anecdotally aligns, none kids know ill beyond mild 'cold' symptoms. 100% fine today. Pediatricians even biggest advocates schools reopening, view essential wellbeing kids. Surprisingly enough also many outbreaks primary schools either without masking! 

If look back childhood would honestly terrible homeschooled long. really needed spend time kids age properly socialize, regulate emotions, learn empathize on. 

Reading threads feel like people overestimate risk covid (seriously) underestimate costs mitigating risks kids.

That said, understand experts USA might giving different advice, please listen doctors. Dumbest thing I've heard day, good job. rate lower flu. lot people don’t personal doctor haven’t Dr Appointment probably since kids. Uh, Trinity River flows south... kids dieing? No, let achieve immunity move on. 70% adults already vaccinated. Hate hear may again. hope light case soon. believe, realized last year CDC's influenza numbers actually extrapolated anywhere near 1:1 correlation actual positive influenza test results, SARS COV2 US since 2020 minor outbreaks incorrectly attributed influenza recent years. test specifically SARS COV2 yet, infections reached critical mass trigger sufficient interest testing ""something new"" end 2019. assumptions CDC made influenza cases recent years likely severely flawed, opinion significant number ""influenza"" cases reported without actual positive influenza test result likely earlier variants SARS COV2.

I'll make follow-up post day current vaccines, inadvertently selecting robust virus strain success, everyone properly wearing masks. really impossible say. would depend new variants vaccination rates. faced decision losing job getting shot, obviously people gonna get shot. worse last summer, bad last winter. yet, anyway. point aren’t seriously talking vaccine mandates? putting heavy pressure anti vaxx holdout employers. Make employers mandate employees. Want keep yer jerb get vaccinated. Want keep paying mortgage? Get vaccinated. Make mandatory. pandemic would year’s end. talking possibilities actualities simultaneously, that's bad. case doubt will. poor countries need distant expiration date since logistical issues pretty great. honestly hope ramped supply months ago kept ramping could get much excess possible world.

who knows actually happened. arm good arm, i'm sure going get everyone fast enough regardless people try. bigger problem (society) collectively acknowledging. nothing yo@7 say show it’s “part conspiracy.” 

I’m taking hard line now. arguing anything- stay life. general public - given clear results ongoing threat, support vaccine mandates wherever possible harsh penalties spreading vaccine disinformation emergency. Yes, please get here. I'm trapped surrounded idiots Turkey doesn’t open pfizer viall unless 6 people queued up. dose wasted. Thought cold past days noticed morning smell gone too. covid literally 8 months ago definitely bad first time. someone merchandises multiple stores day, suppose inevitable, but, fuck. I'm saying back 2020 TX fined someone opening salon lockdown. bunch antimaskers seemed proud cus government getting way business. TX trying tell ppl cant mandate masks establishment. Seems like like getting involved business decisions again. argument keeping scientists want play it, CDC VECTOR last *known* samples, mean unknown samples. headlines terrorists rogue states, course, realistic risk untracked samples — a samples found random lab refrigerator FDA 2014, scabs found tucked *a book public library* 2004.    9,717 Florida hospitals moment. people hospital Florida moment cost US taxpayers $709,341,000 (average cost hospitalized covid patient point 73000). 

If people care lives maybe care money? That's neighbors got to. started working OT local hospital saw number ICU patients go 25-40 Tuesday Thursday last week. Yeah that's whole reason ""well ain't vaccine common cold!"" stupid argument. think rich people hang out? fancier restaurants. People ""hang out"" home, loiter restaurants. that's great. talking RSV coworker recently mentioned premies us hoping available adults point soon.

thanks info  I'm exact boat 19 month old. teach university Florida choice person. private small daycare (knock wood) hasnt single case. like fort Knox protocol. delayed start date pushed ditto back September. hope things better then. 

And someone comments, choice teach person. went everything university ""has hands tied DeSantis"". wanted wait home-produced vaccine

That's news me. think waiting domestic vaccine ever part Japan's strategy, anything promote development domestic vaccine May year. took spin Covid the, ""flu"" overblown. Delta much propaganda behind yet mysterious scary them. forcing union employees get shot breech contract therefore would re-negotiate said contracts don’t want suggests fully vaccinated person chances long COVID cut half comparison unvaccinated person.

Which is, repeat already commented there, misleading phrased like this. chances cut half *if infected*. chance infection ~10% would without vaccination, according studies. chance suffer long COVID symptoms reduced *twentieth* chance vaccination, half it. Fear hell motivator. Testing pointless unless daily, need mandate VACCINES. That's shocking shouldnt allowed ask this?  way people “choice” numbers. However, everyone dire situations always someone willing flunky.

By dire… mean issues make basic life difficult. Cost children, childcare, housing, cost living, wage stagnation, healthcare etc. effects everyone (even directly effected).

It’s nothing… I’m kind glad people holding people need see powers really care about. full &amp; remedy Arkansans vaccinated.""

The problem going month mRNA vaccines going effective. live Oregon. one person talk daily vaccinated. One person swear like 16 adults. swear numbers high. town used live less 100 people show vaccination one location distributed town like 6500 people. could personally take least 50 adults know vaccinated.

Not everyone weak willed enough peer pressured care random people say person internet,and govt gonna mandate vaccine. So, guess lose?

Many vaccinated getting delta infections. mild. Massachusetts like 60% infections vaccinated people.
They getting hospitalized dying.

99% hospitalized patients unvaccinated. funny living life actual fear vaccine, fearful anyone, coming insane conspiracies vaccines forum full antimaskers. get downvoted saying things like also care. job fix stupid people. fuck commenting article all, anecdote large scale study. downvote move think small case studies pointless. I've seen ""reasoning"" sub nothing insults half assed ""research"". So, maybe learn reasoning is, start there. instance asked highly detailed question vaccines didnt get one actual answer backed science. Maybe start along sales persuasion course. saying “it won’t accurate unless” part something could chase endlessly without ever arriving individual’s specific probability dying Covid.

In reply linked calculator risk age condition. I’m saying throw data away, I’m pointing specific number, personal probability, something doesn’t exist. Source? find relationship vaccination rate countries income Wait til find groups America lowest rates vaccination. Really? 1 person article says take gospel? Yeah two companies collaboration several amounts months Delta = [Chuck scares crap everyone except Chuck Norris. 11 years Spanish flu began dissipate actually. 1918 1929 took hold world.

[Spanish Flu epidemic People really think option. Whether believe Vax hoax not… whether want not… vaccinated point intend basic standard living 2-3 years. 

If rely government state assistance way shape form… (social security, section 8, food stamps, disability…) required something go somewhere requires vaccinated complete.

Otherwise… you’re rich none impacting significant way. can’t really forced… choose to. Yep university work effected well. want teach room full 20 somethings ""want party like 2019!"" ""yes bro come kegger"". However, students likely vaccinated...however poll done teacher summer found 20% class vaccinated. (Note: formal poll. kept tally everyday someone mentioned made note.) Donating blood comparatively zero-risk procedure, virtually chance anything seriously bad happening, especially unexpected way days weeks later things like that.

Also, people donating blood receive compensation. Unfortunately anecdotes might accurate/useful stats case, given CDC isn’t even collecting data breakthrough infections. reason people imagine hillbilly dual-wielding AR-15s think gun violence. question well.

Don't let door hit way out. Ok, exactly supposed feel children growing without selfish, entitled scientifically illiterate role models?

These people drunk drivers. hurting themselves, they're causing chaos danger people around them. Many vaccinated hospitalized something covid related test positive.  Sunday, White House reported 800,000 vaccine doses administered, including first second doses, marking fifth consecutive day 700,000 doses reported administered. uptick pushed national vaccination average 637,000 doses administered day -- 24% last two weeks.

Hell yeah. America bring back 800k-1m average doses day, shit really exciting. Keep telling friends, keep showing legitimate numbers fully vaccinated dramatically reduce chance death, hopefully prevent another lockdown.

Hoping FDA approval soon since seems hurdle some. probably excuse many cases, removing many excuses possible good. course one first people line get vaccine know three vaccinated people got covid. felt way. Turns vaccines make us invincible. Still part protective shield. Together masks, distancing, vaccination rates population on.
At point risk becomes low. also need effectiveness severe symptoms. sounds like anecdotal evidence. Latest study UK suggests fully vaccinated person chances long COVID cut half comparison unvaccinated person. We’ve 400 child covid deaths. 613,000 covid deaths people.

Plus among personal social group - we’re worried kids catching covid, yes - think it’s terribly lethal them, there’s lot long-covid effects really don’t want inflict kid years lifetime. Especially considering terrible expenses medical care here. people mild covid get long covid. friend covid mildly irritating symptoms days. Fatigue, shortness breath, coughing bit. used run half marathons fun. Six months later barely two miles.

Plus kids great spreading disease other, idiot unvaccinated adults around them. fills hospitals kills them, importantly kills delays treatment innocent people can’t get treated timely comprehensive manner everything cancer car accidents knee replacements gall bladder removal.. 12 17 vaccinated.

Nobody said 99% required.

The USA severely trailing due anti-vaxxers vaccine hesitancy. point want use argument convince people take vaccine, cannot address individuals more; mandate everyone.

People donate blood *greater good* time, mean mandate everyone donate. would say less effective path. people anti vax developed liberty morality pushes away argument care harm done others. thing appeal care harm morals threat families. really want get acceptance vaccine anti vax person need directly feel threat death Covid via family member. ways spikes good thing. Get vaccinated, folks. You’re still 90-95% protected infection, period. 1-2 20 get infected, CDC Go regular lives, yes. think included hanging unvaccinated people house 10 days. think expected encourage unvaccinated get vaccinated wouldn’t required wear masks. Republican. That's why.  I'm glad Tyson taking step last year several plant managers fired betting many workers would catch COVID. people took precautions probably wouldn’t mess. like think responsible people traveling hot spot another place. I’m still living life, postponed trip— didn’t cancel it. outbreak caused delta variant?  think start now. wait? Vaccines whole said. yes vaccines general proven safe. Guess I’ve got reservations now. Gonna hit pharmacy today heard first hand account NPR yesterday. Guy said covid passports sold outside gates, security even look vaccine proof brought admission, 4 hours crowded left. give source that? need win arguments. ""How many kids ok dying person schools?"" Covid Protocol Covid Protocol. Interesting. Im vaccinated age changes within month vaccine.
Could connected, could timing. Weird like day ago saying half people us vaccinated jumps 70 ? Yeah ok Everyone needs get vaccinated! 30%, it!

Now, time vaccinate everyone booster since vaccine already losing effectiveness,

What nightmare. 99-100% efficacy may well perfect. Thanks suggestion, look that! looked online programs switch work out. school us fill medical exemption paperwork allows us stay enrolled homeschool school's curriculum. tough parent right governor made even harder. feel bad kids going end sick (or worse...) protected school. Maybe lied vaccine efficiency. reference, Netherlands far administered 20.4 million doses according website Yeah imagine bad would be. getting less 1000 calories day simply could stomach anything. Soup best friend week.

I used tell people taste smell gone could literally shit mouth even gagged. bad. nothing tastes like food, brain nagging feeling ""don't eat this"". idea people go months worse without taste/smell able overcome that. really don't. offer lower menu prices vaccinated, McDonalds, every company. Make vaccine status come reward. Chile vaccinated population mainly sinovac vaccine vaccinated vast majority population doses, cases deaths plummeting, despite new restriction set. China vaccinating even 3yo kids great vaccination eagerness, easily reach herd immunity end year, least richest areas country. point requiring masks restaurant people going dining in.

Anyone disagrees paying lip-service problem rather anything substantial. job requires X X reason Q employer legal right know Q. 

And point employer reached end line terms making reasonable accommodations employee job.

IMNAL. retired field operated 24/7/365 required vaccinations. one every successfully played ""I need Saturday/Sunday/Christmas religious reasons"" card one ever dodged vaccinations. Thank caring community. actual thing, far know. mean think people talking like CDC statement something. went looked regions already ravaged Delta, used eyes basic human pattern recognition. True that, I'm back campus quarter many got first shot. kinda stunning me, like guys waiting able go again..? got first shot April o.o I'm terrible socializing EU accept AstraZeneca vaccines produced outside continent? Isn’t basically components vaccine? Wasn’t store employee shot killed security guard? awww….

Anecdotally nothing worry about.

Statistically also unbelievably low risks. Per CDC, there’s 1,000 mostly unverified reports myocarditis 177 Million vaccinated people.

Know else causes myocarditis? Viruses, including coronavirus infection. thought short bu.....ohhhhhhh I'm even sure forced testing population would legal US. precedence forced vaccination public though threat jail time. Whether would survive legal challenge though anyone's guess. hand took Pfizer felt like I'd hit car. Still again. try going work next day. hate admit it, caught live stream pleasantly surprised. haven’t listened since like 12 solid set. I’ve lolla many times even pre-pandemic thought festival way crowded. Hopefully everyone okay though super spreading event. Please, people, get vaccines ASAP vaccine passes stop making sense. Exactly. idea information comes people hard Abbott and/or Huffines comes from. know plenty Republicans issues people. way certain cities got covid bailouts decades mismanagement nothing covid. easily see money held specifically covid use need more. dig pockets otherwise never ending loop mismanaging money. government needs show people got together provide stability.

Still, nobody willing relax mask wearing stance it’s hot humidity reaches 90%. Link info ""standard delta pattern?"" Thank much breaking down. 

Any feedback Delta variant kids 12? read San Francisco Chronicle article last night bay area’s 50% increase children hospitalized due Delta. 

Are seeing kids getting Alpha? tell them. Good evening random Redditor. mean point Covid everywhere limiting travel isn’t really going anything… especially you’re vaccinated, it’s time start living life. Apathetic uneducated voters. Voters treat politics like sports vote party ballot. Voters don’t take time understand issues. everything big evil conspiracy shadow money calling REAL contests. exists it’s great solid representation individuals, quite bit power voters/neighbors/family. counter encouraging people vote, exposing issues, helping build empathy, connecting voters. Yes. think lot people don’t understand Kaiser monolith. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan fairly uniform across different states there’s lot variation among various medical groups. Even Northern California (TPMG) Southern California (SCPMG) markedly different structures rules.  still? know percentage protection vaccines offer, like 90%+. per occasion getting contact virus? hang infected people (this family gathering 10 days!) amount times get contact virus much larger 90%+ hold. you.   Probably also asymptomatic people tend get tested. america conditions money. describes mom too, feel paranoid again. 

I hope mom recovers quickly. really want go get third shot. illegal? Morally wrong? mean, medical professional. way vaccines work. Theoretically, rare occasions, virus remains certain cells, immune cells can't reach them, antibodies do. example HPV, virus stays away blood vessels infects skin cells. covid infection immune cells acces virus create antibodies, though.

It's even described coronaviridae hide certain cells, like HSV VZV neurological cells even could reactivate immunocomprimased say get cousin who’s unvaccinated might’ve severe rock, keep going :^) good got sense taste/smell back. i've heard people took months got back.. I'm sure stop believe make money opening dine-in area. sure would possible (Germany) vaccinations tracked AFAIK. mean if, vaccine fully approved, insurance stops covering cost treatment you’re medically eligible vaccine refuse it, you’d see shots.

The thing people tend listen beyond conspiracies risk losing money.  read somewhere 600 children died Corona virus means twice deadly car accidents? trying get estimate. Obviously injuries makes car accidents significantly worse (depending realities long term covid) treatments less scarce now?

I remember back early year late last, allowed high risk patients (over 60 otherwise poor health). friend's dad got treatment recovered rapidly. I'm curious young, healthy people 20s 30s would able get treatment, since I'm seeing younger people least likely vaccinated rising hospitalization rates. Nah they’re safe Sounds similar grief brain too. grief brain lasted 1-1.5 years spouse died. IMO shouldn’t done vaccine test thing - require attendees vaccinated.  wouldn’t shocked even gigantic packed crowd, outside, vaccinated, didn’t end terrible super spreader event. I’m sure unvaccinated pick take home wherever, spreading along way. I’Ve fully vaxxed 6 months, went Lolla, fun, I’m going go home stay monitor symptoms. Sad attendees same.  reason use statistics anecdotes.

Yeah. Statistics like significantly skewed though, corrected things expect. Like example, think bit unexpected ""young men 30 second dose"" form risk group. identify risk group statistics, might smear risk among whole population, making appear much smaller actually is.

Of course, statistics anecdotes still way tackle this. Nevertheless, think correct skeptical statistics anecdotal evidence makes unlikely. statistics might missed something anecdotes didn't, might need revised. Pissed away what? money Feds already there, shit job pandemic, people sick dying, think need money.   issue longer require quarantine reporting many schools. welcome send kid school coughing sick covid. kid tests positive, need stay home all. Call out. Republicans. people watched loved ones die COVID likely. wasn’t meaning making excuses behaviour. seems like everybody handing free excuses idiots instead letting see stupid dangerous behaviour been. 'Murica Exactly. Since changed requirements logistical issues anymore. refrigerated box takes literally transport Pfizer Moderna world. Perry announced 90% ticket purchasers proven vaccinations. could easily avoided everyone asked quick COVID test entering venue, like UK does. think make good points, also wrestled with. understanding follows:

a) vaxed people get breakthrough infections, less likely infected unvaxed people. Recent data NEJM shows vax 88% effective delta variant. So, total, fewer vaxed people get covid spread it, unvaxed people. working children cancer, cant vaxed, would much rather taken care person lower chance getting/spreading covid (vaxed), person higher potential getting covid (unvaxed).

b) hope people promulgate idea vax 100% effective--really none are, covid vax, better flu vax, still 95% effective alpha variant, 88% effective delta variant.

c) Hospital patient facing providers wear masks, regardless vax status. know follow rules. rules wont change.

d) Availability important staffing. Unvaxed individuals less available, potentially, vaxed individuals.

e) required flu vax every year, wear mask. different, except people tested. Every year people decline flu shot--they wear mask.

f) sure unvaxed health care providers ""careful"" vaxed providers. course, correct everyone needs careful. delta variant different beast.

Thanks much comments--there much changing hard make sense all. Stay healthy!  I'm done riding train... Well, “don’t cram face face thousands yelling people” bit beyond “only much do”. agree crowd probably mostly vaxxed. wonder events like comes we’ve viewed outdoor things mostly safe - seems like stress test things lead spread outside.  test good vaccinated. given high rate odd vaccination here, people already vaccinated. Dealing covid test pain ass people go route. Plus indoor spaces festival (there couple) started enforcing mark wearing again. Curious getting 10% number from. thing cdc see re: breakthrough really crappy “hospitalized fatal” breakthrough chart unclear comprehensive is. Also link breakthrough cases Jan-April doesn’t account Delta also doesn’t appear comprehensive.

Otherwise say vaccine effective vaccinated folks resume normal activity. No, costs money PCR tests. got one done free rest house Sunday. (Husband's symptoms showed clearly Tuesday night)

Japan makes getting test difficult. one home antigen test MIL use quarantine ensure go back work time not. people don’t care never begin sad takes far less % hit herd stupidity herd immunity. vaccination rate even across state. Duval county, home Jacksonville, vaccination rate. Hillsborough County, home Tampa, 43%. Many areas Florida complete done away masking distancing, are. That's literally opposite Delta transmits vaccinated people. know vaccines prevent transmission Covid? I'm trying argue them. obvious prevent disease harming people. pay people go business.

No, plenty places US, especially rural areas, $15 reasonable wage entry level work. understand many major metros different story, $15 everywhere US.

I one want small businesses go out, leaving us big corporate chains little competition. Tell children Simple question, end goal mind? 100% vaccination 0 covid cases? DeSantis going sue them? always going like flu shot. We'll never get rid yearly booster either enough people worldwide get herd immunity. Eventually covid annual biannual booster get risk. Yeah man show ID travel airplane authoritarian Caught who? Minimum wage workers care card ? you’ve gotta realize people aren’t epidemiologists, virologists, kind doctor. whole experience made people aware things otherwise wouldn’t. Sounds likely early signs Chronic Wasting Disease. Latin America Caribbean don’t deserve tribulations they’ve going past 5 years. shit. fallacy apply here? I’m making observation.

I never said everyone single opinion matter. K cute news needs head hours north WI Dells witness wtf going around there. Yes lot stuff outdoors lot isn't. I'm looking Mr. Pancakes.  Can't expect good faith arguments threads vaccines preventing hospitalization vaccinated. work fine. certainly trying milk much possible.

It’s climbing states delta washing that’s it’s reporting first dose 70%.  People getting first dose. can't business stay open tell customers enter risk? bars check negative STD tests risk willing take? necessary even allow access transit. It’s tracking, it’s also control. act show ID go bars since forever  Help understand wearing mask part minimizing spread deadly virus steal additional months life. injecting perspective here. Neat. risking health well-being children definitely worth make principled stand reckless. F*** kids. pwn libs! fact think you’d commission weeks rare breakthrough infection double vaccinated funny. It’s like stubbing toe getting wheelchair How? Everyone getting vaccine adult capable making decisions. vaccine literally protects virus extremely rare cases extremely small chance getting first place.

We’re point everyone wanted get could now, don’t stay inside wear mask. It’s difficult follow. unnecessary. everyone terrified Covid anymore. people ok risk, that's ok long live someone like grandparent. 

Those worried unvaccinated kids accept people behaving way act accordingly worried. expect everyone continue lock indoors 1.5 years this. get packed tight, outside SIGNIFICANTLY safer, no? Ah noticed broken English. lot makes sense now, must country even worse education America. Use docket app NJ personal choice, wouldn’t controversial. mandates. Listen, I've worn masks probably longer 2 kids kept school last year. also playdates camp mask live 75k persob liberal suburb 85% 1 shot age 12.

But fucking game get zero deaths. risk everything life.

3,500 kids 18 gave hospitalized 18 months. 60% preexisting conditions. 

There 75 fucking million 18. chance kid bringing COVID home killing fully vaccinated parent close zero things get. positivity %'s lower time last year? so, likely lot fewer cases now.  sure anyone take word it. Seems like ""really talk."" Thanks posting conservative sub narrative could laugh say that? Mind ask good-faith follow questions? 

* know vaccination rate county others greater metro area?
* reside county lowish vax rate, going events maskless people (vaccination status unknown/unverified) packed shoulder shoulder? Church, festivals, bars
* attend events, wear mask? know said comment do, times don't, likely &lt; 10 feet maskless people?

Again, judgement, curious zeitgeist. year's yet. Look numbers. factors pale comparison discrepancy. already voter registration numbers driver's licenses prove identities, ID voting specifically seems superfluous. problematic. people aren’t going break law, dude. Getting caught repercussions. people going get vaccinated wonder something voter fraud exceedingly rare something anyone cared nutjob made fringe issue vs disease that’s killed 600k plus Americans counting. Oh 90% vaccinated crowd outside! 

Commence pearl clutching! either. website awesome. fuck trolly problem really matters ""party country.""

If Abbott loses, throw behind Huffines. cared state, he'd throw behind Democrat Democrat would win. really talk. 1 2 people got charged selling cards Possibly, can't really reason would different particular time fewer lives lost - maybe we'd outbreaks postponed little.
 
We're already final form. can't wait go away. won't. waiting vaccine. several. Maybe hold children vaccinated. know. 70% atleast one shot

Didn’t trump like 30% hardcore base btw? Super lame… we’ve come long way understanding what’s going history books written pandemic, include chapter explaining many people chose risked health children process. indoor areas? Wasn’t just… one place indoors? I'm going work hours. Masks required hide inside Somewhere around 20% population kids 12. combine adult unvaccinated population pretty even split. Hopefully rectify go forward. Desantis really said surge result people staying inside due heat? 

does know kids go school? 

unbelievable Lollapaloozers That's amazing, assuming recipient can't fix berate cable company employee fix downer unless school also changes class mixing communal cafeteria/lunch areas masks marginally effective kids. absolutely wearing masks, nobody talking administrative controls.

I'd link sub like Amazon links search find one thats perfect you. Uhhh areas done seen MAJOR rises vaccination. I’ve already talked two people going get J&amp;J cause this. 

What you’re saying isn’t backed data. NYC isn’t extreme like areas US regards MUH FREEDOM conservative sub probably 

They got worked yesterday next sturgis. Yes totally 1:1 examples required vaccine cards 24 hour prior negative tests... followed rules everyone asked. spreader everyone negative vax'd. I'm curious whats motive here. I'm us dummy resources fascistic border patrols, right?

This horrible. seen reports allow people without proof long promise wear mask. Florida many infections... they've ever had... despite decently vaccinated? Congratulations eye eye make whole world Mahatma Gandhi DeSantis also entertainingly trying destroy cruise industry.  Good, children meant neither seen heard I'm sure employer going tolerate spending hours workday supervising kids, suspect remote employee and/or spouse homeschooling. Realize simply option many people. physicians ICU treating COVID patients can't ""just homeschool"". solution current problem. probably depends place. Madison square garden's policy iirc requires negative covid test last 6 hours unvaccinated children. 

Fact kids vaccinated going dining first place. I've vacationed Ethiopia, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, lived Mauritania. totally right, tourism industry places much; wanted say possible. Pretty rewarding, too. wouldn’t isolate quarantine infected? can’t go job least ten days test positive regardless symptoms I’m definitely going anywhere, including seeing friends outdoors like now, I’m positive. Whether get symptoms not, missing work problem. Same. I'm vaccinated wore N95 aftershows. point, vast majority people getting hospitalized COVID unvaccinated. I'm honestly done going things love protect people. Haha easily fake sneak festivals Reddit hates parents. think we're seeing lot companies wanted wait full approval knee jerk bit delta, explains timing. vaccine first introduced, people still wore masks distanced. protected unvaccinated. Obama planning like 500+ attend 60th birthday party? blatantly illegal. 

Thank god repubs fight this, win. Businesses aren’t usually capable turning people tho, 100% pro vax bar owner instance wants require vaccines customers, competitor street *wont* require vaccinations, get edge you. Plus business owner wants discriminate huge swaths customer base? way  Canada 71%, country 70%. one meets imaginary criteria.

You seem really take title article personal. Maybe take break Reddit. lol

Those people haven’t realized Covid stay like flu Ok. convinced kindness. Thank you. pretty good article: 
 
Note ""% chance getting vaccinated"" different ""what % covid cases given state vaccinated people vs unvaccinated"". 
 
% chance getting &lt;1% everywhere. it, vaccinated range &lt;1% %. 
 
Also note big Delta surges heating exponentially last couple weeks, even mid-July data might outdated terms relevance.  
 
If guess would expect vaccinated people's %chance contracting virus increases bit Delta variant saturates country. fraction people hospitalized/killed virus shift even towards unvaccinated.  playing small scale everywhere right now. Musicians day jobs make choices playing shows small venues. debate amongst band members. hungry play crowd want throw caution wind.

It’s probably like 80% effective chance avoid infection exposed.  posts I’ve seen citing crap like .1% 1% something like comparing positive tests total vaccinated people without accounting everyone exposed every breakthrough caught test. Hell even alpha original best case claim 95% infection mRNA vaccines. Stress body change periods - usually delaying response stress. Getting vaccination stresses body.

This well known long COVID unique COVID vaccination. *stop* spread virus, likely slow implemented adhered to. 

My understanding vaccinated people *can* still spread virus, like unvaccinated likely spread symptomatic, less likely carry enough viral load symptomatic first place, thereby making less likely they'll spread all. population level, matters. course.

That’s right: 39,079 Floridians died COVID, far. That’s fourth biggest total states. Right now, 58 people dying every day Florida number going get bigger.

The conventional wisdom seems somehow bad political prospects Ron DeSantis.

I disagree.

In fact, would propose exact opposite: worse things get Florida, better DeSantis’s political future.

For number reasons:

Every time DeSantis criticized media, helps him.

Every additional death evidence didn’t cave “the lockdowns.”

The people die watch, greater testament fidelity cause modern conservatism. proves he’s RINO cuck like Mike DeWine.

If people really believe COVID fault foreigners, bigger death toll, aggrieved DeSantis nefarious foreigners hurt state.

Let tell you, right now, line be:

Nothing bad happened Florida. It’s bunch lies liberal media want hurt Ron DeSantis. anything happen, DeSantis he’s patriot believes freedom keeping economy strong. wasn’t bad Andrew Cuomo did. it’s fault foreigners.

Anyone thinks failure manage COVID could hurt Republican political aspirations hasn’t paying attention. anything, opposite true.

In near term, Republican voters going deeply suspicious anyone acted responsibly COVID. worse things get Florida, better Ron DeSantis. keep mind Lollapalooza targets under-30 demo lowest rates vaccination. totally different makeup baseball game (the 40+ beer-gut crowd) kind outdoor Broadway/Michael Buble songfest event. stadium games assigned seats can't go &amp; mingle &amp; intermix way open seating festivals. law. It’s truly sad day...But bet people excited “mUH hEaLtH sAfEtY.” vaccine works, leave others alone. Stop coercing businesses able serve want.

Do know diseases work? people choose get vaccinated allow virus continuously spread, mutate, time render working vaccines less effective. ""choice"" helping hold back everyone around you, continue spread virus. yeah, people get call choices. first vaccine rollouts many people commenting “oh people holding get doctor. need focus there” maybe 5% weren’t vaccinated time (think like March/April 2021) mean point could tie one thing? Everything open fully many places almost nowhere limited capacity.

I seen people car crashes plead get taken ambulance want impoverish family. messed up. true .  places really start shunning anti-vax people, we're going go nowhere hurry.

Also, potential millions evicted going help either. don’t think it’s media. I’m thinking breakthrough cases real. However, it’s similar bad cold worst cases. I’m waiting results test coworker tested positive yesterday. together among coworkers sporting event Friday night. us vaxxed. think know patient 0, vaxxed.

I'm mortified state (Texas) send kids person classes without available vaccine, oh yeah governor made forbidden legally punishable government entity including school districts sort rules masks.

I see combination could possibly result dead kids. sarcastic wanting state complete authority consequential medical decision? vaccines work people content knowing got shot protected. Forcing others makes sense, unless vaccines dont really work advertised. really needs emphasized originally supposed weeks working home first 😭 look like think know something, really, can't consider possibility wrong thing know nothing about. don’t say? Clearly CDC missed part apparently need wear mask fully vaccinated despite updating national guidance indoors. tend think bit knowledgeable college senior regards infectious diseases. remember shit first started hospitals screening questions whether patient traveled outside US recently. wonder many countries screening people visited US lol.

It particularly ironic screening questions still asked locally fucking epicenter whole mess... like, motherfuckers, matter they've anywhere else, know they've plenty here. hate selfish ignorant antivax people, sure. I’m saying it’s sufficient shouldn’t need this. Vaccinated people large protected people aren’t mostly putting risk. flu too? kids could wear type item protect them, maybe someone even invent something. This. Also think many people running around undiagnosed issues predispose severe Covid don’t know yet? Many Americans go doctor things like diabetes irreversible.

The number car crash deaths US seems insignificant use denominator entire US population. However, creates idea “it can’t happen me” so, does, it’s really impactful. That’s we’re seeing stories news people interested them. happen happen.

We great data collection car crashes, lots states counties, well CDC, simply aren’t tracking breakthroughs. time, we’re told “use best judgement” without much information. us go back forth math kinda insignificant lots places aren’t reporting likely lots breakthroughs aren’t caught surveillance happening. words harsh. making sound like covid restrictions, god knows long, possibly decades, small sacrifice able without complaining much even struggling little. case. huge, huge big deal.

Sorry came ignorant genuinely curious COVID less deadly children H1N1 restrictions. 1,800 dead H1N1 vs 350 COVID.

[source  Don’t think happen due fact American wouldn’t accept decades plus vaccines eventually exposure grant natural immunity anyone needs know Attendees baseball games normally don’t fck suck like crazy Killing business, business GOOOOOOOD! - Major Payne Lol imagine titanic grabbing onto sinking debris since orange idiot told them. would say that? valid question lot times it’s “my vaccinated friend got cold, didn’t get tested it’s definitely breakthrough” never know anything sure. suddenly requirement here? COVID killing children Mexico Brazil, countries?

Lack access care? hope sake you’re grown ass adult saying mishmash due national system type thing. biggest single digital vaccine card system moment know US SMART health card system, used states California Louisiana, well stores/pharmacies Walmart Sam's Club. CA, input info, send email temporary link, screenshot page give normal vaccine card info plus QR code easily scanned verified. There's also app Commons Project lets link card. IMO great solution, without national healthcare system really work outside states use it. Sounds kinda like virus recently broke still friends wish *all best*. We're trying get rid thing get lives already. Kids? Remember 2021 supposed year come nightmare?


It's almost nothing fundamentally changed.  Fuck around find Mid twenties, yes. 1996 usually last year considered millennials, although I’ve seen said years later years earlier too. 

By metrics, youngest millennia’s going 25.  isn’t likely happen luckily ... Tool? Gillum run again, next year might actually shot. heard firsthand recommendations kids. (Make sure look sizing) Bye bye anyone went festival unvaccinated, vaccinated didn’t show negative test entry. Best Wishes. Warmest Regards. That’s fucking heated. I’m glad vaccination rates going antivaxxers get say “well doesn’t work!” suspect see lot cases like that. People legitimately can't get vaccine likely want put lives risk going restaurants bars. 

We'll probably see cases anti-vaxxers who'll use self-diagnosed ""medical condition"" excuse, fly court law. ya still know sure say it’s protest, Covid isn’t contagious protesters. Anyone clue we’ll see actual data efficacy Moderna delta variant?

I see lot speculation Moderna might effective Pfizer, haven’t seen real data. I’ve operating assumption basically identical I’d love know concerned waning immunity.  Would prefer mass media article shoving opinions mix even looked editor published? invisible wrongly assuming everyone unvaccinated currently carrying transmitting it. 

That works pandemic though. assume everyone infectious. think everyone required wear masks? sounds like even planet earth. serious? Thanks answering man really appreciate it. perfectly healthy 40 year old double vaxxed dying Covid long shot people worry pressing issues. big country produces lot anecdotes. Anecdotes data. Let use analogy here. saying much like claiming best way learn boxing jump ring heavyweight champ, time going learn box.

While learning part might technically true, reality going get ass beat, go unnecessary suffering, spend lot time recovering injuries champ manage kill outright ring.

Instead, could trained responsible way, gotten better boxing skills time, go pain suffering potential death. 

Of course, unvaccinated person actually making worse choices analogy, reasons. first staying vulnerable put everyone meet risk catching create risk new variants.

Add 'teaching' disease immune system almost always temporary goes away, leaving vulnerable before. 

One biggest reasons humanity studied medicine much course history able fight diseases better ways simply putting immune systems endurance challenge. 

If really want test theory out, try something minor first. Say, Herpes, see well works you. black, world would use term? excuse…  Good, starting wonder news hitting week hoping we'd seeing lot trying get vaccinated.  don't. I've worked 3 Live Nation shows past 2 weeks, provide information every time show up, plus temp check fill symptom survey... really reject everything scientific? example, accept scientific understanding cause lightening, think god selectively causes lightening anger? Reading comments tell different sides politically agree you. Almost 100% Nope, unfortunately not. [singapore study tremendously promising symptoms beyond initial 5 days far less likely.

Nearly recent data long covid (in unvaccinated) positive. shame done research year ago. think Biden pretty good job. get new friends Oops thinking Gen X well. That’s like Fred Durst wasn't, anyone believed otherwise &amp; 2020 worse year ever memes naive. that’s great theory mutations coming back around could nullify current vaccinations it’s back square one. Wear mask, get vaxxed it’s easy. US island homie. And, AFAIC, infections traced them, infected people's med bills too. 

I'd love see ""It's choice"" jagoffs get hit negligence claims. certain they'd liable, conversation had. People need get heads ""personal choice"" affects others. everyone gets covid world collectively move forward. Vaccines help prevent severe cases. Everyone likely get strain covid eventually however. Yes, show proof vaccination negative test day. supposed wear mask entire time fest vaccinated. However, reality check thoroughly basically waived people held print proof. Also, inside rare see people masks crowd. 

However, think policy incentivize people going getting vaccinated never know beforehand closely they’ll checking proof. 

Undoubtedly, people faked proof get lolla, knows many. Yup. I’m sick hearing health care workers burning people keep getting sick KNOW reduce risks keep people safer. get it, vaccines available free everyone wants one *months* now. We're point refuse vaccine get Covid die, that's *you.*  Everyone vaccinated, like polio, TB, MMR, mass vaccinations new, CDC clearly states still testi6 phases group asking volunteers. may receive COVID-19 vaccine. However, aware data currently available safety COVID-19 vaccines people autoimmune conditions. People group eligible enrollment clinical trials. information vaccine clinical trials found HPV vaccine stops cells becoming infected.

I believe anything like effort disease transmitted respiratory droplets, however. masks work wood workers painters using protect health? buy filters vacuums HVAC systems?

 conspiracy 3M Cummins, obviously. states parents opt kids getting vaccinated religious and/or philosophical reason. seeing local municipality/state vaccination mandate. out, honestly getting brain damage concerns death.  dont live death.  can’t figure isn’t working me. vaccine proof Walgreens app, would nice could use excelsior pass keep iPhone’s wallet. 

I also photo CDC card saved phone. requirement would chance passing first place design excluded kids 12 mistakenly use “unvaccinated” 1st sentence? Sounds like feelings hurt.  enough prohibit non-vaccinated associating public vaccinated.

Read first part sentence. Texas probably spent joining SEC know mom 2 Texas freaking out, supposed send school students (all unvaccinated) supposed eat maskless cafeteria together. I'm not!! 😠 fully vaccinated BNT catch delta variant, mean experience anything worse cold? Tbf isn’t based statistics? cases per day hospitalization numbers low, things open. Also, vaccines shown effective preventing hospitalization death. hope ends hospitalized covid, sorry. Yeah see lots people vacations schools starts. fall interesting. He’ll never admit there’s problem he’s wrong. 2/3 US states 10 positives per 100 people since started. able start putting hard upper limit many asymptomatic untested cases last year. yes, lot people starting catch again. cases even 5x, confer even partial immunity, along partially vaccinated population now, latest surges drop quickly. don’t, one assumptions incorrect. It’s ok, Beetlejuice signed it. /s rather Remember made virus political fuck lol fucking cares? Everyone choice get vaccinated. point virtually deaths result Darwinism, aren’t fleetingly rare inconsequential policy perspective. Let kids fun stop clutching pearls. It’s time move on. ban guest campus? Unless check person coming campus, seeing truly enforce it.  Although, anyone able ensure every single guest vaccinated negative covid, it’ll event. big fear...there. I'm thinking whatever comes Lambda gonna one. shut now. /s kinda /serious. yet find kn95 fit little kids face. gaping holes expensive. also torn seams. adult ones fit much better adult face. wish better options kids. feel beat surgical mask. I’m going ezoo really wish they’d require vaccination. I’d even fine getting tested beforehand (even though I’m vaccinated). 

I may decorate lightweight mask wear trust one Could? still pandering? bring COVID deaths, people vaxxed end deadly variants Delta, don’t force vaccinations another 1-2 years COVID. 

Fuck man. Amen kids never significant risk COVID.   autoimmune disease disqualify vaccine, neither cancer.

Stop making shit up.

Here Yale University says issue:

***""People immunocompromised recommended vaccinated cases higher risk severe complications COVD-19 infection. ""***

Cancer patients generally recommended get vaccine, people autoimmune disease.

I know someone autoimmune disease received vaccine doctor recommended get vaccinated.

The people get vaccine generally extremely small segment population allergies components vaccine delivery system. 'ghettos'. unvaccinated walk among us, sit next us restaurants, ride transportation. around, infecting other, breakthrough infections, vaccinated. break social contract agreeing harm others. effectively walking bioweapons.

I’m sure attendance rules like prior covid it. husband kidney transplant I’m screwing around covid.  Others sick. This. 100%.

From March: said disagreed ages federal government chosen vaccinations, like teachers, sites supported Federal Emergency Management FEMA sites, regardless age,"" DeSantis said policy allow pre-K 12th grade staff member, age 18 older, get vaccinated sites. state sites — Hard Rock Stadium Marlins Park, instance — however, school employees must age 50 we're we're following data, data tells us 22-year-old school employee, less risk somebody that's 70 65,"" said.

Not sure problem is. [Age major agree governor's reasoning here. state allocated money Distance Learning? No

Nor it. Kids invested programs vaccinate poor minority communities across state? No.

First, must repeat [nationwide CA problem Hispanics. second, yes Governor even mentioned efforts protect teachers essential workers mask mandates comprehensive measures? No.

Nothing currently stopping teachers essential workers getting vaccinated. so. little research please defending inaction

I get it. He's anticipated run president someday trying kneecap even runs. Newsom CA. understand twisting everything DeSantis carry evil intent part politics. I'm buying it. Anecdotal 17 year old daughter unvaccinated caught second case covid last week. Keep reading. say isn’t clear viral load translates directly transmissibility. got vaccine got banned r/politics said wanted people make decisions regards vaccine.

At least people open rather black white problem you’d getting mask forever territory. Vaccinated people always going interacting unvaccinated people various degrees depending location.

Obviously, varies depending person security line, could printed vaccine card name “William Buttlicker” would waived without issue.

I’m sick daughter put risk people think Facebook memes reliable sources information double-blind placebo controlled studies. People need grow hell get vaccinated. Delta Florida instead.  Even though, ""what percentage huge group people hospitalized"" want know. want know ""what percentage vaccinated also **exposed** people hospitalized"".

But much difficult number find. think would require *very* good contact tracing. Well considering announced 90% lollapalooza proven vaccinated leagues leagues safer protests last year people run things dont give shit, want tickets sold. whole thing needing negative test proof vaccine nothing show put higher ups.

This assumption honestly. airlines done exact thing entirety March 2020 beyond. None give fuck either.  Yeah that’s true. vaccinated carrying virus much unvaccinated. Maybe breakthrough case would, shorter time. Leading country average daily deaths. That's extremely oversimplified way looking situation point incorrect.

First, virus *will* population forever. absolutely question, ever question essentially moment discovered animals infected virus serve reservoirs same. Eradication never going happen, plain simple, anyone says otherwise incorrect.

The question whether virus population moving forward; question whether degree stress poses public health sustainable whether individuals highly effective ways protect poor outcomes. latter absolutely true -- vaccination! former challenging little yet large proportion population remains immunologically naive. mean…that’s fine idea, support spirit…

…but given government procurement procedures, would take until, oh, roughly 2032 roll properly.

Dropped chunk legalese, could made fit condensed typeface. really sacrifice much way printable/writeable  think sorts warnings “experts” would carry weight consistently applied

Much less likely unvaccinated though. agree wrongly assuming someone infectious proof.

Yes! Like said basic assumption pandemic. would need social distancing protocols otherwise? Ok great, mask mandate please! 

Also anyone know current restrictions events , like weddings? still lovely memories March 2020 dismissed ‘someone hangs r/coronavirus’ I'm guessing introvert? I'm highly selective socializing still want able socialize vaccinated people, articles like basically trying demonize vaccinated people social. There's little emphasis unvaccinated person reunion, disgraceful.  countless folks (like me) shots carry greater risk virus.

Also, subreddit one voice find relaying said vs compelling one way another.

My argument something done okay; obviously internment camps Jim Crow laws abhorrent. specifically saying vaccine mandates past lead totalitarian government, come viewed historic atrocities items mentioned. fine refueled anti-vax conspiracies started whole vaccine-autism nonsense. here, I’m staying home 10 days monitor symptoms! ... said doctor scientist. I’m really confused feel pandemic wise. I’m reading crazy potential variants could emerge time I’m told Irish government hit 90% people first dose tomorrow things great 

Edit 90% adults problem headlines like this. weaponizing women’s issues agenda. people care side effects birth control, care fact men steal supplies taxed, supporting fertility treatments? 

No, anti-vaccine community wants us notice supports agenda, anybody actually cares women’s health. Children approved FDA receive it. That's big difference contextually. better believe approve, lot school districts require then. I’m vaccinated tested positive. fever aches, congestion, cough, greatly reduced sense taste smell. vax doesn’t seem effective variant. Immigration latest covid denier's battlecry bizarre. unvaccinated immigrants blame. WTF?! true. Gdi upvote… months ago, around vaccine appointments started becoming plentiful. Around April/March.

Nobody talking proper procedure vaccinated beginning pandemic. weren’t even vaccines available back then. F director CDC ruining everything. wear mask work now. fully vaccinated good person!!! 😡 Yes bc USA constant supply vaccines ever since January, Brasil comparison started pick July. see point, arguing really biased say variants come Brasil India, although stated, also, India indeed pretty bad, US quite literally achieved 50 percent vaccinations pretty much everyone started acting like over, vaccinated not. mean wrong.

Better murders rushed field work ease many areas advanced degree needed they've able unions get shots fired. get it. First big outbreak note NYC.

Lots PoC there, melanin deprived people thought people's disease, thing would impact them.

Now virus deniers parts country actually concerned get sick die.

Whatever reason, damn Skippy people running shot hope continues. every 2 infected unvaccinated people get long COVID, instead 1 vaccinated person would. 

It's yet another reason get vaccine, also incredibly reassuring.   good question. Let explain

In order reduced rate infections population need % immune individuals population reach critical threshold. exact percentage threshold is, depends almost entirely infectious disease is. measure infectivity counting average many people 1 infected person infects course disease. called Basic reproduction number R0 (pronounced R naught). 

The Common Cold R0 3, means average 1 case cold infect 3 people. high end spectrum Measles R0 17, means average 1 case Measles infect 17 people.

To calculate needed percentage population needs immune reach needed critical threshold reduced infection rates simply follow equation. 1-(1/R0) * 100%. cold equation 1-(1/3) * 100% 66.6%. Measles 1-(1/17) * 100% 94% population must immune halt spread disease.

The original varients Covid-19 R0 roughly 3, 1-(1/3) * 100% means needed 66% population immune see decline infection vaccines plus prior infections got us 66%. Delta Varent though much infectious prior varients though. R0 seems 10 12. 1-(1/12) * 100%= 91.66. level infectivity holds mean need least 91.66% people US immune Delta Varent see decline infections. impossible reach btw. Delta infectious Chicken pox, less infectious Measles, 95% population immune to. takes work holding friends, neighbors, accountable getting vaccinated.

i know lot questions, feel free hit up. there's point matter every bit space used ventilators.

Just saw story saying Florida release weekend numbers. next week number states going make us wish last year's worst case scenario. There’s % people never get vaccinated matter what, there’s another % somebody explain way makes sense them. gotten overt could potentially face liability. point mitigating potential legal issues. get credit, least net-positive thing. Yeah, this. move hundreds customers hour drive through. environment, guy pays 5 dollars spends hour two hanging worth table. Fuck em, won’t missed. hope son well. &lt;3 Cases matter 5 groups. Note deaths bad result cases, hospitalizations long-term damage issues happen well).

1. kids since can't get vaccinated;
2. immunocompromised since can't get vaccinated vaccines really much them;
3. idiots choose get vaccinated;
4. people can't get care things health care system strained (for example, someone gets car accident, person surgery even something like colonoscopy cancelled postponed).
5. breakthrough cases serious cause long-term issues.  Delta Variant: ‘scuse whip Hmm...when searched isbe website earlier, saw this:

A. ILLINOIS OFFER FREE ONLINE PUBLIC SCHOOL OPTION LIKE STATES?
No, time free online public school option, unlike available states. responsibility parent/guardian provide full educational program includes required subjects.

I'd love option, though. specific info? We'll judge that. they? damn straight, people joke americans mUh FrEeDoM shit right there, thats literally freedom. Well, ballpark numbers, 330 million people US. 250 million adults age 18. 70% vaccinated, leaves 75 million people unvaccinated. know hospitalizations current wave overwhelmingly unvaccinated. 

Of note, 70% vaccinated national average, still areas pockets highly unvaccinated also nearly 70% (only 30% vaccinated). 

And there’s Delta itself, AMA podcast listen called “one highly contagious respiratory illnesses scientists ever seen”. Cali Illinois wearing masks rest year struggling states don’t to. Can’t make shit up. Yeah there's active argument basically vaccines stem cells something. heard back last April, people would refuse J&amp;J aborted fetuses used. states among conservative, conservative states generally behind rest. 

Maryland higher percentage black people Alabama, almost much Louisiana. examples liberal states mentioned higher average amount black people vaccination. Right. He’s appeasing audience. That’s people getting covid vaccinated. Likely month ago despite vaccination (it going around clinic chose get vaccinated, us get tested many us sick days- included) uncle tested positive Monday symptoms shortness breath. He’s also fully vaccinated. 

They counting number people test positive vaccinated, hospitalized die. couldn’t really change wanted to, counter covid tests take home one would result except you. Texan here, McDonalds open since state reopened. Every employee wearing mask..around chins.

Love state. dat said wearing mask? 

Geaux get vaccinated too. Honest question, us donating vaccines they're using? Texas also rule. Report came Massachusetts 74% cases vaccinated. get everyone seen conflict interest handling entire pandemic. 100% factor dismantling integrity cohesion nation. Teamed dividing factor nation, we're nose dive. wear mask half hour three times week go gym hour grocery store.
I oppressed. Illinois many options including publicly funded online school. 10000% agree WTF world rn concern around making people get vaccine still emergency approval FDA. it’s approved? Totally board.

I’m saying someone got vaccine soon could. see response poster. feel free hit questions FWIW, table sugar vegan either (because bone char used refining agent).

(Not vegan, toured lot sugar-producing world.) Yeah, give week tops. inevitable. Religious exemptions thing. specific allergies contents vaccines allowed.  Yeah, similar story PA - though delta's catching up.

Regardless really help apply people vaccinated still deal fall overwhelmed hospital systems Florida Texas Louisiana Missouri, good bulk states general right now. None children opportunity get vaccine. start school 10 days. half people unvaccinated household income 50k year. 22% 25k year. 36% demographic never even plane. really much.  Officials Expect Vulnerable Americans Need Booster Shots  growing consensus least Americans need booster partly tied research suggesting Pfizer’s vaccine less effective six months.  coworker refuses come they’re unvaccinated afraid get COVID. asked haven’t gotten vaccinated, say they’re afraid side effects. 

They posted social media vacation COVID hot spot last week. Yep, know quite nurses stacked enough overtime bread past year considering sabbatical. exhausted. ask help might any. percentage unvaccinated people experience case? Unreal % vaccination area. wonder California laughing stock country. 45 prior medical issues 

To clear talking like members FB feed. got vaccinated soon could, chunk Facebook friends really hit particular loss. Texas dropped mandate 7 percent fully vaccinated. dad told yesterday ""doesn't believe science"" changes much. know, update guidance learn information. also seems think science religion ""we're actually lot alike"", him. thinks thing ""you beliefs, mine (but stupid change much based improved understanding)"".

So that's we're dealin' with. inorder reduced rate infections population need % immune individuals population reach critical threshold. exact percentage threshold is, depends almost entirely infectious disease is. measure infectivity counting average many people 1 infected person infects course disease. called Basic reproduction number R0 (R naught). 

The common Cold R0 3, means average 1 Case cold infect 3 people. high end spectrum Measles R0 17, means average 1 case Measles infect 17 people.

The original varients Covid-19 R0 roughly 3, 1-(1/3) * 100% means needed 66% population immune see decline infection vaccines plus prior infections got us 66%. Delta Varent though much infectious prior varients though. R0 seems 10 12. 1-(1/12) * 100%= 91.66. level infectivity holds mean need least 91.66% people US immune Delta Varent see decline infections. impossible reach btw. Delta infectious Chicken pox, less infectious Measles, 95% population immune to. takes work holding friends, neighbors, accountable getting vaccinated.

i know lot questions, feel free hit up. Abbott openly challenged Huffines, ten times worse Abbott. Texas conservatives, Abbott RINO - basically think he's bad Democrat.

Abbott things voters demand it. acknowledges Covid bad here, he'll lose governorship. You’re projecting people onto me. said nothing protecting feeling bad deaths old people immune compromised people. merely interpreting data giving clearer picture 20-70 age range. Oh thank heavens. 1918 Spanish Flu lasted two years. think weird virus all.

Human beings probably always mercy pandemics/plagues extent. actually think that's possible? understand always another variant? serious post?  Ohh… vaccinated? Definitely agree try different ones find works! use well-fitting cloth mask KN95s/KF94s, basically seals gaps. true. get vaccine (we 60’s) didn’t feel great next day, mild flu systems. Employers need cut people slack here, need day it. employee gets COVID could weeks, hopefully employers recognize that. Although anecdotal, shingles vaccine WAY worse COVID. could worked next day vaccine … figuratively kicked ass, could get bed. Covid vaccine much worse annual flu vaccine. Equal opportunity employment exposed numerous times never understand desantis gets away shit Mostly delay ***American*** coasts. FDA site says certain (high risk, direct exposure etc) pediatric patients 12 adults. Hello fellow Floridian! 

And hey, outlaw mask mandates...he said schools could lose funding put mask mandates. Totally thing, right? Right?!

I'm exhausted sarcasm left. front line retail, grocery restaurant workers really tough. Today, went favorite INDIAN restaurant - pre-Delta busy place.

Almost customers lunch time. waiting take-out order sign wall. ""Please sneeze cashier's direction."" 

That made sad business that's trying survive cooking good food body soul would put sign like that. I've never seen sign like life. 

 tell someone. Thanks reading. Ever notice headlines never places like Vermont shit? Almost like something states common...hmm. stupidity always makes 30% country. states among conservative. focusing states instead noticing trend. pass turning point? true even low vaccination states places rates people getting vaxxed going up? loss compounds. linear.

They might able invert entirely catch course next year. 

We're going find semester. I’m sorry I’m sure did! please explain avoid future? Florida updates data weekly. Makes stairstep effect charts. 30%, you’re right portion population always wrong side. Everything bell curve. COVID never going away. ""war"" fought till covid eradicated, refuse take part it.

I got vaccines locked available. I'm longer interested ""war"" honestly care anymore. Covid going away, especially since vaccinated confirmed able spread covid. Combine billions still unvaccinated worldwide means covid going away.

More that, also many years left climate change starts really, really screw things up. plenty time miserable later, I'll least want fun, travel, go concerts, etc. hometown still inhabitable. drive-through line cars closest McDonalds reaches road, avoided one. Dining inside would nice McDonalds see go trips neighboring states. understand still pandemic, staff supply shortages, need masks. better keep staff safe now, one day reopen seating area. I’m sick tired hearing absolute moronic bullshit Texas Florida. Can’t keep population safe, crooked core, ‘deregulated’ BS macho shtick even keep pathetically inept infrastructure afloat. Get together. SARS1 MERS natural immunity infections years lot scientists say 5+ years. unvaccinated people (who healthy etc) contract covid end hospital recover home. It’s small number/percentage end hospital probably finding data hard, doesnt fit doomsday narrative. Finally Well burned out, part. Covid really share lot characteristics Spanish flu, likely burn out, given ability mutate different strains forward / variance. one hates word narrative? overused every damn context (not shitting you, OP). Americans found Canada beating it’s vaccine war Canada state fair begins September 24. go forward it, surge could last quite while. Yeah criticism always foot door saying choose *not* vaccine and…. Eh.

They could lot clear must stupid reprehensible almost situations get vaccine. people private pools water lawns that'd free lot water. Big knows there, mean, point, know, one comma, there. Trump lost Georgia fewer votes people Georgia died Covid. whole thing started, hit populated (blue) areas. it’s mostly conservatives refuse vaccinate. 

They’re starting realize politicizing Covid might kill voters. like: 1 100,000 people fully vaccinated ~~and~~ caught COVID died it. already studied. Headline reads like something Trump administration. Scope practice state dependent (Georgia comes mind broad scope practice) absolutely incorrect LPN call nurse *are*. There's varying degrees education RNs ADN BSN take exact NCLEX. 

I understand doubling LPNs nurses literally are. state board nursing disagree you. Better yet, go ahead report LPN STNA see calling nurse BON see gets trouble calling nurse LOL indications people got vaccinated longest-ago highest rates breakthroughs. words, vaccines wearing off.

Israel LOT people fully-vaccinated earlier UK Canada, delayed second doses.

The US closer Israel regard, least older people risk serious breakthrough cases. know many people would never understand much racism made fun movie. Sad.  [National Academy State Health Policy tracks legislation regarding banning vaccine specific stats based state. mean there’s like 20 staff one patient pic. Wonder hospitals also used photo request? /s think employees either? Guess what, police help managers would much rather appease double down. one else employees back up. We, sensible customers, stand they're harrassed jobs. Eh Mexico Mexico city specifically getting crushed right now. good job keeping stuff dl really late. think 80% hospitals full Friday. one near live line outside treats covid. None gets widespread coverage here. Probably 99.9% policy positions absolute garbage. Stop old. Stop pneumonia child. Stop auto-immune disease. Stop unlucky. 

But yes, agreed, obesity help anyone anything.  this, many tend believe role scope nurse narrow fact quite broad. unvaccinated impelled logic reason, unvaccinated.

There's reasoning obstinate moron. Social pressure government mandates wil real way forward. sources anecdotal I’m sure type states actually vaccinated lot people therefore need mask mandate least type states likely put mask mandate. 

The type states hardly could get anyone take vaccine therefore need mask mandate type states least likely implement mask mandate. 

That’s state things, folks. RN here. vaccinated since February, I've still hope booster. could people disappointing get Trump family, probably get tested tell anyone could maintain red cred. same.. working ICU Agreed. honestly matter CDC tells anyone even mandate supporting people give peer pressure around friends family. got covid october. many times acute disease wondering whether time take trip ER. i'm still long hauler almost 10 months later testing positive. hope everyone (who can) gets vaccinated, want long haul covid. actually know percentage population specific site vaccinated- likely lot them. 


70% adult population STATE vaccinated, instance talking literally gay bear festival- lot traveling involved. close contact, partying, dancing, crowds on. 


4/5 would 80/100, one can't assume number people getting sick would would comparable based assumed population vaccinated people vs. unvaccinated, make sense. highly likely well 90% attendees vaccinated, more. Provincetown 90% adults (permanent residents) vaccinated. 


Like, 70% attendees obviously sick, certainly fewer that- given festival involved hundreds people globe. one man died unvaccinated. 


They tested hotel restaurant staff event, something like 11% came back positive.  


Notably, vacationers increase towns' population around 3k 60k course Summer. typical situation. 


So long story short vaccines supposed do- prevent strongly reduce severe disease death, delta protection infection (including asymptomatic infection) lower. 


We're different ballgame Delta. everyone capability get vaccinated vaccinated U.S., think we'd right now. would still concern, much less worrisome. shot, best get it.  Lmao saying meanwhile stupid people acting like things back normal. Ok, get now. 
Your initial comment came rather wacky though! 49% fully vaccinated. Canada 56%+ making big comeback. Awesome news, keep going americans. 95% vaccinated efficacy 80% Okay, authoritarian? Well, sincerely hope judicial system system checks balances survive never end onslaught authoritarianism. shows US 57%? 

is old data? Lmao seriously apparently she’s also mentally challenged, jeezzz mandate students  ...do people still really think masks shit? Fucking hell, get vaccinated already ditch mask horseshit. yay! glad you’re getting taste back! thankfully didn’t symptom. also pizza today. can’t wait go grocery store tomorrow! No, genuinely confused. thought vaccines available country. lie right? issue messages interpreted dude, totally missed point. maybe need list. boat lungs good touch wood. 
I agree vaccines would disastrous family grateful people like Dolly Parton invested Pfizer research  conservative states large black populations. Exclude kids too. Make get weekly test like every unvaccinated person. Exactly, can't recommend efficacy proven controlled study. makes lot sense me. I've fantastic nurses shift change, unprofessional rude nurses.  protests mention still going Oregon, democrats protesting election, anarchists. live Massachusetts. massive super spreader event here, resulted total five hospitalizations, call it, Bruins game. 

We're also 80% vaccinated, last week I've seen marked increase mask wearing, bars starting require vaccination proof. Survive what? Literally nothing happening. Ditch mask on/ mask BS, drop futile intermittent shutdowns. Everyone goes back living life. allowing whipped heightened state unprecedented frenzy nothing.  Nothing hide nothing fear Hello, fellow kids. Yup. coworker mine went Florida got covid, vaccinated. case count (and family members, especially kids young vaccinated) counts toward New Jersey, Florida. way likely get brain/heart damage virus specifically damages people's brains hearts lungs etc. WOW , vaccianted one dose too. buy GME stop dumb. I'm-a-make health care with...blackjack strippers. test? Release booster Seriously?

“Colonizing”? continues implement measures recommended doctors scientists, despite protests Republican congress conservative populace. Facebook replies page, would think living embodiment devil.  MONSTERS least ain’t Sidney, Australia! Yet. Nobody understanding seems it’s new virus don’t know everything know yet. lot expectations political propaganda surrounding lot frustrating idiotic wrap head around. thought Contagion grand over-exaggeration gov population would react pandemic ways actually worse! Ok, even 90% people vaccinated, 75% getting infected vaccinated STILL pretty low efficacy vaccines.

It's troubling. There's reason spooked CDC. disagree comment. used ER regularly child ha respiratory distress. doctors floated nurses ones knew exact angle bed would improve oxygen saturation. ones would make sure enough blankets pass crackers juice didn’t feel faint. heroes me. 2005

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAY risk unless stop chat. Yes, UVA hospital last month simply hire anyone unvaccinated. exceptions. employees also required get vaccinated. opt required wear mask anywhere campus regardless masking requirements everyone else tested covid weekly. wish hospital worked would this…  Well nurses attend lot less school doctors. There’s also lot them. Education. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ is. system successful enough stably support certain number free riders. doubt US survive this, take longer typical developed country. Anyone who's worked hospital knows large portion Nurses batshit crazy. Rule thumb 1/3 amazing, 1/3 decent/apathetic, 1/3 completely nuts. know happens, people working hospitals agree guess universal. need hospital point near future there's serious chance get less adequate care - people died completely unrelated things previous surges ICU beds them. Understand sentiment, otherwise.

Still, incredibly cruel way govern.   Well good quote counter Permanente serves 25% state's population, received less 10% state's vaccine since December,"" said spokesperson. (ABC 7 News)  Well Singapore heavily authoritarian, even surprised Democracy device ensures shall governed better deserve.

George Bernard Shaw Abbott shitscared primary *anything* address COVID would anger wrong people. That's said Yep. 

Lets say vaccine reduces chances getting infected 2/3rd's (67% efficacy vs. delta). 

Well, get vaccinated feel safe.... start things 3X likely expose COVID, chances actually worse. 

That's infections, apply hospitalization around 25X likely, similar thing. pile bodies front governor's mansion

You’re blocked…  testing boosters currently. wish every state would follow suit. Make mandatory churches, well. Difficult say exactly, [cases hospitalizations still rapidly cases rise? one type person tends yell type person reason they're standing out, looking like idiots, loudest Mind explaining why? Hoping get back 2019 soon understand low vaccination rates make challenging. Hope won’t take two years though US media politicians can't help divide nation every single matter. Oh boohoo. Less babies government tax future.  worth getting shot crazy anti vaccine fuck minimum wage job. understand that, possible due politics, one next best thing.

Ah, Fuckitall We've done absolutely nothing can't bothered Variant That’s correct way interpret 64% figure.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah it’s called mom getting vaccine she’s pregnant. Nice attempt sarcasm guess allowed ask proof work. new song Beck, so... that's pretty cool. Worldometer pulls data sources fairly large delays reporting deaths. good real time look deaths. Much better looking two weeks back. fascinating CDC apparently believed announcing removal mask mandates vaccinated would push people get vaccinated rather provide cover unvaccinated ""go back normal"".

Unfortunately guys, laws rules always dumbest dangerous offenders true, West uses resources much efficiently rest world.

The difference West consumes MUCH per capita rest world. Beaten times states actually tried. too, antivaxxers, usually means ""i read blogs antivaxxers scroll facebook."" never actual research data. Underrated comment. No, example stupidity media.
The troops logistics relief system. helping visiting quarantined people help safety health department workers.

Well done falling scaremongering. Yeah sure. unfortunately people site calling additional lockdowns due delta, think need clear anything like would severe reaction.  fed even power that? ""they""? know Pfizer/scientists said booster may needed depending long vaccine stays effective, personally seen specific time tables.

I know I've heard plenty anti-vax coworkers family members saying ""booster every x month"", based scientists saying vaccine proved effective 1/2/3/6 month(s) gradually.  Well need new job place? trucking company work letting everyone 'go back normal'. Covid never happened! way death rates calculated, won’t see going lot people died. Tbh, I'm amazed Florida already disease named it. Ooo heard Starfall, I'll try that. luck using zearn online math last year Duolingo ABC. I'll relook IXL. Thanks! shall referring 2021 Vaccination Vexation. anti-histamines taking? foods eliminated given benefit? I’m interested study differentiates causes neurological complications, anyone insight — child icu suffer brain damage varying degrees poor oxygenation intubation, icu delirium. saying virus creating damage ensuing treatment interventions, secondary infection, causing it? Well far, case. recommendation that's reintroduced vaccinated people wear masks.  Jeez, ABC7. Could phrased awkwardly? 99.99% kinda okay covid. Nobody position power policymaking (in US) suggesting lockdowns business closures. fearmongering. know one areas?    Lol say anything get click Thanks laugh, dad  people reddit PMC dweebs gotten work home last year half understand like go world shit No, that's I'm suggesting all. pandemics eventually end. literally history mankind. usually end herd immunity, virus/bacteria gets weaker treatment makes manageable. can't say come first though. really. Vaccines 100% effective, best ones two shots around 90% average.

So still 1 10 chance getting shot face. I’m natural selection unless looks like might get selected. don’t think delta prevalent I’m entirely sure. weird one states surge (from remember) time.   ask long ""long term study"" supposed be. willing accept official line official health organization (which makes concerned one arguing good faith)...

As reminder, says clear bold right close top article tells us severe side effects extremely rare, occur, usually happen within first two months.

Don't trust source? one? side effects show within weeks allThat say never safety issues vaccines. instance, appeared soon widespread use vaccine began.“The side effects see occur early on, that’s it,” Goepfert said. “In virtually cases, vaccine side effects seen within first two months rollout.”

Or one? history vaccines shows delayed effects following vaccination occur. do, effects tend happen within two months vaccination:

So. short: wrong showing YEARS later. also tell people okay say bad things Donald Rumsfeld Antonin Scalia died? swear report came 2 months ago said vaccinated people extremely low chance spreading virus Better nothing  OK mr im expert. Heh yeah that's I've angry 18 months, one. Gotta love usual reddit rock-throwing randos. Seems Mondays reason. Unexpected delayed? kinda figured anyone who's antivax going eventually change tune, especially public persona.

I never thought antivix covid permanent position level, barring something astronomically improbable like mutating completely eradication. definitely hot experience.  Narrator: didn’t eliminate  extreme tyranny folks. government need held responsible prosecuted. comply bullshit. Insurance companies could say cover care related COVID eligible vaccine medical reason get it. Saturation what? virus?  There's going lot Covid Orphans this.   studies? point direction able find them. ""the narrative""? Whos ""narrative"" it? many tinfoil hats own? let unvaccinated run life FFS, got vaccinated, way less 1% vaccinated people get seriously sick. like guys completely vulnerable  Seems possible. 

Fortress Australia  vaccines available kids yet. are, long enough kids full immunity plus two weeks (give parents two weeks track vaccine kids), agree you. Vaccines kids + 6 weeks.

I feel bad also small minority folks actually can't get vaccinated safely, though. know folks due health issues overlap health issues cause vaccine intolerance. yet met person group generally anti-vax. Nothing makes realize value vaccines better option get them, especially since lots folks also high risk COVID (immune issues seem often involved folks can't vaccine - extreme allergies, etc.). 

But also can't project group forever. are, all, small group people. everyone could safely vaccinate vaccinated folks could actually reliable herd immunity :-/  f else do? Telling unvax get vax? never that. live lives way pleased too. Pressuring others get vax sure hell I’m never gonna do. unvax wants spread virus die. able so. Wow almost like shit works 🤷  Masks annoying shit though. vaccinated, fuck mask!  necessarily meant agree comment, suggest otherwise? Assuming Vid is/will endemic, assumed pretty much everyone can't get vaccine get disease point, unless keep restrictions forever.

Both tests came back negative, I've wondered one August quite bit. wife work home isolating pretty solid. Interesting. didn’t hear about. Thanks correcting me. still think guy I’m responding little bit doom spreader. get this. vaccines still strong protecting us. McDonald's requiring customers employees wear masks U.S. restaurants located areas high substantial transmission fast-food giant largest national chain add requirement back employees customers following updated masking guidelines Centers Disease Control Prevention.

There's ambiguity.  I'm still angry ""my ignorance good science"" people. is, lives continuing normal. country sickness. Covid. lot wrong post. 

1. vaccine working incredibly well, even immunocompromised. number deaths COVID among fully vaccinated number hundreds. almost certainly better protected believe are, long stay top doctor getting booster shots continue. fully vaccinated, COVID drops way list potential problems facing.
 
2. Check flair. Specifically, research focused understanding causes death related infectious disease. I'll tell you, think trials 12 kids vaccinated got news you. severely immunocompromised nothing changes. can't tell many cases see rhinovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, RSV, dozens pathogens commonly see vaccine good treatment take someone out. immunocompromised joke, unfortunately going take extreme measures long remain state.

Should cancel school next cold outbreak? bad flu seasons RSV outbreaks? then? Public health policy focuses good least harm, unfortunately policy going reduce risk zero everyone.  

Just examples. ban swimming Texas, Florida, Alabama Texas prevent Naegleria infections? ever seen Naegleria infection does? horrible death. 

And alcohol...alcohol abuse kills thousands year drunk driving accidents, increases domestic violence, directly related health issues like cancer liver cirrhosis. prohibition good idea repeal 21st amendment reinstate 18th?

It sucks man. Again, sorry situation. public health policy designed reduce risk zero everyone. he’s done much actually hurt gay people, much worse making fun closeted alter ego acquires prostitutes secrecy, feel problem calling whatever want. It’s gay slur. It’s making fun hypocrite. ""elective"" surgery delayed year. elective sense get it, probably kill immediately, longer wait likelihood catastrophic event.  scheduled later month, fuck everyone that's putting risk again. decide wear mask want dork Points irony. Percentage increases mean nothing without required…context…of base increase is. 

My rule thumb media mentions percentages, means numbers low. mention numbers, means percentages low. mind wearing article clothing accessory. slightly repositioned hat.  hope like covering premiums don’t rise much  “I want over”, says guy refuses get vaccinated  might really dumb questions...but bad news? Like, 70% population vaccinated current spike trend resembles last summer's spike 0% population vaccinated...what fuck going on??? 70% well past herd immunity criteria? spike like what's happening now, theoretically, possible?? numbers pretty abysmal developed nation.

^ Dude paid attention France, New Zealand, Australia and/or Japan Yeah, pre- post- party weeks really means lasts month.  joke said socialize mask. walk business, bar restaurant one, get seated served allowed rest time depart use restroom. 90% time socializing maskless. many historic pandemics lasted several years 1.5 yrs isnt really insane. Sample narrative CDC back beginning pandemic: 

Narrative: ""The average person need wear masks.""

Reasoning: ""We need ensure healthcare workers able get masks need.""

Result: Millions millions antimaskers ammo, even today No, man. No. prior 2020 referred immunization records, needed school/employment. 

I hate No, different vaccines elicit different immune responses leading different outcomes. could one delivery system effective delivers copies viral genome another. could proteins viral vector help trigger different parts immune system. 


That said I'm little sceptical Johnson Johnson much effective single dose, especially compared AZ similar technology. hard compare vaccine efficacy outside trial designed compare I'm bit suss numbers. advantage 2 dose vaccine tend result longer lasting protection. Biden heavier reach PoC? People need start questioning effective handling pandemic is. gap March July Blacks Whites widened 6% 12% see: 36% vac rate whites 48%. 

He president long enough. He’s evil, crazy. Someone hope, nice see! Running steam here... ""And said still ruled humanity could die days sooner that!""  Yo people getting vaccinated? Sweet! always afraid vaccination rate would stagnate decline even. I've wearing mask gym February till June 15th bad. ran too. used athletic Reebok addias ones. Get F here.

Polio R0 5-7, hit herd immunity maybe 85%

70% amazing, 4 weeks first shot people second one good, we’ll new batch first dosers bring higher.

The issue isn’t herd immunity anymore, it’s getting people pockets low vaccine uptake areas get shot.

Someone area 40% vaccinated won’t much travel say city 80% vaccinated rate. 

This herd immunity works - it’s also import understand local, county, state federal level.

If never leave city, city showing 80% higher vaccination rate - golden dude Healthcare area hesitant enforce vaccine mandate staffing shortage already taking place. one person per household permitted leave home per day get groceries. People allowed go school work cannot work study home. People may go outdoors exercise allowed travel 10k homes (about 6 miles).

I'm seeing much way mask wearing overall. Shopping Harris teeter today. Majority staff customers without. Disingenuous stat here. Considering 80%+ attendance estimated vaccinated, saying “80% hospitalized” cherry picking data considering 4 5 people.

They're ICU 🤦 He's uncharacteristically quiet lately he? link number coming from? evidence breakthroughs likely among infected Covid previously without vaccine versus vaccinated? That’s time around, epidemiologists like Lavine fear even difficult get people masks, especially believed pandemic moment received shots.

IMO pretty self regulating. people respond consequences. Look what's happened vaccination rates last weeks delta started gearing up.

I'm betting community hospital starts refusing patients turning away ambulances, folks community get vaccinated.

I deny frustrating, imagine folks angry. Oh well, pass. look current situation take best steps can. IMO 2022 lot better. monotonically better, better aggregate. LOL, worries. Vaccines definitely reduce death hospitalization, important thing. probably thinks good job.

Neat. According [Israeli Pfizer's efficacy drops sharply starting 4th month.

According immunity continues grow 8 months. giving panic attack too. child little one way wonder we'll ever feel safe enough visit family members old travel Ya that’s thought too, need masks safe all. logic people infuriating. don’t right demand mask get vaccinated right tell put child life threatening situation. play Russian roulette child’s life, mine.

Now get caught brought back globally! new variant Japan yet detected, would also bad :(

""and compare public minuscule?""

Imagine people guests house. say please take shoes entering. catch daily walking around house dirty shoes on. house eventually going get dirty anyway, fuck it? think misinterpreted comment. fully understand vaccine isn’t protect all. I’m saying don’t fully believe presented figures around 100/105,000 vaccinated people don’t get symptoms COVID (or whatever .1% stat is). 

And thank kind words. would like take vaccine, I’m teenager living parents moment they’re deadest us taking vaccine. They’re worried long term side effects since vaccine developed quickly, think vaccine killing people. anything do? kids vaccinated yet asshole. struggle judge, myself. heart failure induced illness young, wait full year two normal echos got clear try son. think experiences left slightly overprotective, always say, gamble children! starts midnight tonight. Thoughts well: Maybe agree ""not December"" folks (though really), like took December first. full three phases trials required that. Anyone December said ""you'll dead year"" proven wrong March 2021 got thing trial periods starting March 2020 *didn't die*.

EUA shorten minimum testing periods bringing something general public - gets things top paperwork piles lets production ramp trials still happening. anything caught end trials requires modifying treatment, production far scrapped restarted.

Full approval would let sue manufacturer easier, that's great reason since theres already federal system place compensate people interim (NVICP CICP). Sure avenues far perfect pair with, uh, reducing chance dying global pandemic/getting long term symptoms obvious choice. You’re wrong, however that’s lot studies focused. It’s also skewed sex age too… 

There studies thread focus UK general population. Yeah especially hospitals resources help everyone else instead tying mostly preventable illness now. purpose researchers paper. someone who's worked policy writing, fed it. Emergencies/Crisis's grant broad sweeping powers would make breeze. Weird - Williamsburg 10 days ago people obviously aren’t wearing masks outside places there’s food drinks, wearing stores. also wouldn’t exactly call either neighborhoods free tourists partying 20 something year olds coming neighborhoods/out city night life. residential low key neighborhood always mask compliant. I'm exclude kids social life can't get vaccinated yet Inhave lost patience Ah, reason assumed N95’s also filter exhaust somehow since they’re used medical settings. Hadn’t considered valves. really hoped COVID would great unifier. Guess I'll hold aliens, zombies, velociraptor apocalypse mean they’re gonna spread go dp drugs, fuck, party like lot college kids do. Hell, even ones don’t go extreme still gather maskless campus. That’s masks delay inevitable. getting news alpha overblown delta big deal? lived like covid, occasionally hospitals worldwide collapsed covid every 3 months. logic sucks ass. mean, biggest issue CDC somewhat dishonest aerosol transmission.

I understand lie, WOEFULLY unequipped 200 million adults going masks.

However, subsequent episodes, including recent one taking one small situation massachusetts, giving incomplete information without proper context, using make national policy unreasonable.

Calling 5 cases per 100k people 'high' country 57% vaccinated nationally, pockets much higher (and much lower, fair) vaccination making 'one size fits all' determination frankly irresponsible me. know since n95 vented (air exhaust w/o filtered) thought might issue Fortunately office 2 anti-vaxxers position cover either specialize different things. feel bad hourly guys trade supervisors deal nonsense.

It’s eradication it’s containment house still fire right keep taking extra precautions meantime. Pandemics take TIME sort out. Yes we’re advanced today we’re still humans working what’s available us. Science sold magic, it’s not. We’re going bumps road that’s OKAY long don’t get impatient fuck over. anyone else alarmed mortality rate breakthrough infections basically identical nonvaxxed? get Covid vaccine (which isn’t likely), mortality rate still. That’s terrifying. Thanks! that's definitely true. meant inequality global scale. Like, states US throwing away thousands doses boosters considered elsewhere vulnerable groups many countries even begun vaccination process lack supply. Well conversations today people love acquaintances able share research well. Texas, it’s either Dairy Queen Whataburger. Lol 97-99% die unvaccinated. That’s pretty good measure show they’re “working”. 38 here, enjoy ride.  Im sure pompous attitude makes change stance immediatly. Oh wait, wont... J&amp;J solid Delta. dad left. finger guns lad can't wait vote office. airline enforcing policy specifies mask type? I’d like keep mind emergency travel foreseeable future. No, that’s way eliminate virus. majority population worked hard stem spread virus. 
Freedoms restored lockdowns outbreaks passed. 

The ADF used support enforce.

This global conspiracy suddenly stop world living free, would look like group people trying overturn legitimate election.

Take look melbourne went hard lockdown two weeks (much stricter Sydney) getting back normal world. Beating Delta variant twice. want. Let eat cake. Fully vaccinated people infected, far less likely happen, chances dying suffering long term health issues due covid-19 much lower.

It much deadly mutation people fear, considering covid-19 deadly capable causing long lasting damage, people afraid Delta Plus mutate gain ability completely bypass vaccines, sets herd immunity back zero.

Vaccination greatly decreases infection chance covid-19's ability mutate. Saying anything else pure ignorance.  private businesses requiring masks…but customers. Lowe’s, Target, Kohl’s, Home Depot. Employees wear one customers high transmission areas. employees get mask day 1000 unvaccinated unmasked customers face. anyone works places upset all? fail? 97-99% hospitalizations unvaccinated. 97-99% die unvaccinated. 
It’s reported anywhere 40-65% effective catch covid. numbers good data show they’re failure. vaccines safe vaccine, wtf scared exactly? ""other"" people? 

The reality is, new variant spread vaccine. So, whoever ""other"" people (kids, etc) , much danger people vaccine. 

I really expect sort logical answer turn ad hominem, strawman pressing arrow, maybe I'll surprised. seems like want feel superior people medical decision doesnt affect anyone else moment. Weird flex. see antivaxx proportions US

Contrary popular belief, antivaxxers make large proportion US. France Japan significantly worse regard. forget antivaxx movement came rrom... UK require vaccines served. That’d clear quick. 58% based overall population US, whereas 70% adults? anywhere close advanced. still use paper time cards christ sake I'm salary lol.  previous company much larger swipe badge general entry well sensitive locations everything automated still worked without major revisions staffing, security procedures equipment.

Best everyone really I've literally talked people say get vaccine they're waiting gov give money. really look anti vax stuff think antivax hyperbole seeing. sounds like high risk groups may getting one [later US another reddit commenter said Germany well. worried unvaccinated? There’s really annoying strain RSV going around. weeks ago. way know sure get tested. went got tested hacking coughing head didn’t COVID. could that. know, terrible parents. could left children orphaned.  many pregnant ladies heard died vent, baby brought world early. 

I'm mom. least understand mom's hesitancy... thoroughly vaxxed. Well guaranteed super spreader event. Delta gonna ride die. I'm staunch pro vaccine democrat strongly believe would federal overreach mandate it. I'm 100% fine businesses, school boards, etc mandates. aren't.

Lol, teen mid-90's, Moto-Photo place hang reason. idea loads places choose from. I’m sorry. friends vaccinated can’t yet, like kids. mean, you’ve always able get sick. you’re personally danger wouldn’t worry That's good reason caring them, though. opposite, would say. like giving people poor luck yet stress manage. I'm going get shot standing anti mask nuts. wait football season. I'm booster vaccine. mix cocktail shoot up. point haha. nurses reason mindset doctors idea they’re question every decision probably same.  fully vaxxed 3 months relief felt afterwards worth much [Counties voted trump far lower vaccinated rates Biden rates percent difference grew April likely typo yeah. they're still getting covid though, gives? ""breakthrough case"" kiss ass. vaccine ineffective Nice /s people believed it. Meh guys disappear get COVID die survive long COVID longer work living.

Coin flip. county rocking 48%.I hate here. might, many people support happen. I’m curious you’re getting 66% number. look total time cases % U.S. population, it’s 10%. Obviously that’s reported cases - actual cases estimated much higher, much 4x. let’s say 40% U.S. population natural immunity. group evenly distributed across vaxxed/unvaxxed people, that’s additional 20% protected gets 70% immunity. also think it’s likely unvaxxed population likely already contracted covid, maybe it’s like 60/40 distribution gets 74% immunity. Obviously many factors play maybe I’m overlooking important things, feel like likely closer 80% immunity 66% immunity. i've playing ""allergies covid"" game past days went get tested today. got boxes n95s really cheap weeks ago  still confusing though, even though population 70% vaccinated, vaccine job, total hospitalizations exact representation population. less 70% vaccinated ppl getting sick, more. Correct? Count niece stat! got first dose today. concerned long term affects vaccine. told concerned long term affects Covid (my wife still lingering breathing issues son's taste buds still whack)! everyone family fully vaxxed (out old enough), we're fine clearly see. I'm currently pregnant, chose, support doctor, get vaccinated asap (start second trimester). afraid causing issues meet son? Yes. afraid getting Covid us dying? Absolutely.

You balance risk vs reward nothing indicates Covid better choice. 


\*Edit, letter. So, McDonald’s. seriously, good. got vaccine pharmacy like wall greens keep digital record report health agencies. 

I'm California able pull mine going state's health dept website. dumb taking antihistamine nasal spray mess covid test tomorrow morning? know. point someone people concerned enough DNA even CDC cartoon diagram says mRNA change person's DNA something like that. would like saying vaccine contain nanobots Planet Express ship something else.

I think vaccine safe. 50% would high though, vaccinated people still significantly unlikely even infected, according recent stats. Anecdotally, looking like pretty common infected fully vaccinated. let's say 25k vaccinated, still leaves 75k unvaccinated, makes sense, going go unvaccinated people like wildfire. That’s nasty looking fry Always. Look history says.  Teachers lose retirement protest Texas. Guy interview said really checking      
Chicago Tribune reporter bought one fake vax cards    
  
At point coming near anyway little boost source that? Someone linked study showed 88% doesn’t seem right, alpha covid 95% beyond rare someone catch covid it, Delta seems changing game completely. guess ignore places like Detroit match say....
Yes, conservative people likely said vaccine. group refusing fairly large numbers.
Are trying win argument look data? going wanting mandates? know anyone wants mandates. ""they""? One problem see large number people interpret amount nuance lie. want simple concrete answers change whatever reason, even response emerging circumstances, suggested behaviors change, call foul. problem comprehension technical literacy, plus bad-faith mouthpieces. ""Does vaccine prevent virus?"" want anything complicated yes no, even though simplification tantamount lie. Pfizer expected start trials August.

I heard official studies, France based one administered 3rd dose kidney transplant recipients.

However, really aware studies. addressed cherry picking pointing state whole doing. It’s like seniority. sucks, unless you’re senior. target already hit many Chicago area counties (worth mentioning since certain group decided try politicize Lallapalooza compare Sturgis year ago required proof vaccine negative test) course rent higher. mortgage covers loan, Rent covers mortgage, condo fees, property taxes, maintenance costs (some/all)utilities. get it. bad parent big ego little sense. keep reminding me. already know. know get around paywall, that's honestly problem. Try kill kids anyone else's tragically bad judgement. Goodbye. AOC feel you, kids go back School 2 weeks, budget reasons, virtual option. it'll cause run hospital supplies high? always going defense arguments unsound invalid.

Are talking yourself, bud? truth one wants hear. Normally use entire population includes ineligible idk uses eligible rare vaccine 39 pct effective delta per Israeli study. family members refuse get vaxxed. know stats ones hospital almost unvaccinated, stats likelihood need hospitalization first place? There’s little change minds want know risk much stressing mortality. I’m finding articles saying it’s deadly, deadly them? guaranteed bad worse symptoms? Nothing read consistent it’s busy trying spread message get vaxxed, that’s great support it, doesn’t stop need data ones unfortunately refusing. rest 30% go live moon. logically follows delta would make patients sicker, since greater % spike proteins primed enter human cells, compared previous variants (source: know states higher vaccination rates. also know black people get vaccinated less often. pretty common knowledge point. know, either living rock purposefully facetious. Hypothetical: US kept mask mandates, everything else same, would case numbers changed much?

Personally think so. Numbers exploded November real change mask behavior. People wear stores follow rules go home huge private gatherings. Vax numbers high want. course delta. show proof want too. Got it. will.And take kuzmack etall. They're cherry picking. new variant spread vaccinated, 1/8th likely get COVID form (asymptomatically symptoms) spread it. If

Do data show supports this? Thanks! Idk man want get still kind trips out. grandmother got last week absolutely feeling body waist doctors says might ever regain feeling able walk ever again. Residencies taking memorized information learning apply real life issues. Nursing staff taught processes. nurses become masters applying information real life situations, it’s part requirement make diagnoses become accredited. means ones conspiracy theorists, etc, become proficient nursing tasks without weeded nutty opinions.

This way lessen respect nurses nursing assistants. majority excellent jobs often keep doctors track closer work patients. leaned nurses cared sick newborn - noticed things doctors didn’t helped us get diagnosis. point vetting human traits different role doctor, misses wackier people. Yes, misleading.

The vast majority unvaccinated people gotten COVID last months, few-months period pandemic (including pre-vaccines).

So attributing protection vaccines protection vaccines misleading. Oh shit. Alright. Already gone week work I'm worried employer might fire me. Better get tested, yes. look vaccination rate states there's clear distinction average. FYI: Casualties deaths. Casualties includes wounded, captured, MIA well. good vaccination rate Miami-Dade Broward county.

Unfortunately probably want avoid college stuff like parties, bars, clubs, etc things settle down.  sure - start till 26th, knows may happen next weeks... Anecdotally left trial got Pfizer shot. FB group trial participants many others same. felt like choice. several doctors, including site coordinator, say though it'd okay get approved shots top Novavax shot. younger people, also lean Democrat. needs stronger; dilute again! Well, escalated quickly. look people cry freedom comes wearing mask like morons freedom. mean, look up. talking point entire year black people get vaccinated lower rates races. RN 2 year Associate's degree could different UK higher % vaccinated got second dose recently time since second dose seems issue. 

Looking Israel might informative, assuming ""here"" mean U.S. thanks man, number seemed way high I’m good data, would ever able find data many vax’d people exposed never knew. It’s impossible, much like knowing many positive cases actually exist based asymptotic cases. go info hand. would similar concept 90% vax rate country say vax’d people getting virus. Statistics really flexed favor intended audience. would say given current climate, (I speak specific area FL) it’s safe say we’ve exposed soon. current strain makes OG seem trivial. Must hard republicans, don’t majority grocery shopping McDonalds? What’s point tho Experts what? Epidimiology?

If permanent means endemic, then, sure that's likely happen. 

Once endemic, going ""still discussions."" 

Sure, maybe get masks full time doctor's office 30% population wearing flu/covid season. that's really still ""having discussions."" Canada also working Medicago Fully vaxxed since early January. Actually really hopeful booster. concerns still effective. Tbf one dose vaccines pretty damn effective preventing severe Covid. It’s relevant statistic Natural selection also selects intelligence, aka getting vaccine eligible. current population vaccinated (fully) 50% (165M total) hope spirit optimism, half new infections vaccinated half vaccinated, terrible. I'm quite ready put ""we're doom"" hat yet.  70% people US age 18 people got covid survived mild symptoms. we're attributing already high survival rate covid (check cdc stats) vaccine? Hilarious. said anything trump? Like literally cases dropped 225k 70k 1 month.. That's statistical fact. Could coincidence, again, drop like shows drop tests yeah, take however want. say again, care politics, like literally dont care, enough crap here, looks sus af, statistically speaking take long get it? examples even apply. South Korea Taiwan managed contain spread virus using HARD measures Americans vehemently oppose e.g mandotory indoor outdoor mask wearing, personal device tracking, ...And citizens, even vaccinated, comply rules without going ""but muh freedoom"". country masks, social distancing vaccination used control outbreak confidentlg say faring much better US even though vaccination rate much slower. vaccination superb masks sort collective action help reach zero cases (look Taiwan new daily case), US see even conscious knowledgeable think personal effort apparently restrictive moment inoculated disease.  Finally good news midst delta outbreak make data Israel? welcome internet fucking normie Stupid expression video takes quotes context. trusting Trump's word alone different taking vaccine made him. Here's something said September 2020. say would trust Donald Trump would credible source information talks efficacy reliability whatever he's talking about.  Keyword effective. Chinese ones aren’t really terrible. gf exact thing maybe 3 weeks ago. 10 month old got little snotty well. can’t find one saw last week, similar late Happy July 4th everyone aint nothin texan optics

(and yes, worst place earth) like deep end level crazy. Like borderline abuse.

I say extremely pro-vax pro-science person. science says vaccines work. 40s voted T***p keep party power kiss god damn ass.  understand people churches wanting meet agree masks. insist gathering try least endanger rest population. We're gonna get downvoted heretical opinion. Tortillas chips fuckin gross mean, there's zero logic position. course thing convinces gonna make sense, position make sense begin with. think many McDonalds planning drive thru service going forward. look states behind instead cherry picking. true. Vaccination guarantee. step right direction, one helps make sure going hit hard, infect many people, otherwise. seconds. Watch yourself.

""If Donald Trump tells us take it, I'm taking it"" Alabama. understand take all.

Adjusting guidance based new data ""lack science"". embarrassing government even mandate people right thing. Masks vaccines either/or proposition. both? different colored/printed lanyard given employees shown proof vaccination. allowed take mask, wearing said lanyard. Easy see makes enforcement breeze. Hospitals understaffed prior pandemic, nurses doctors leaving healthcare droves. protecting hospital capacity still system collapses- may inevitable. said order apply employees religious medical reasons support “narrow” exemptions vaccination.

So required all, then. Got it. Republican, majority are. outrageous mandating top priority giving context? hate “\_\_% gotten one jab” headlines. Everyone preaches getting jabs build ample immunity. also numerous headlines reporting millions people skipped second dose. 70% first jab sounds good, doesn’t mean 70% both.

Yup. Two doses needed. Especially delta variant. one dose effectively useless Delta. lot people going get sick. History going kind generation. surrounded morons think Jewish satellites setting forests afire, vaccines intended introduce microchips us nefarious purposes, okay openly display blatant racism. God long flat earthers. harmless stupidity. That's I'm thinking too. Seeing vaccination rates go businesses/entities require vaccinations gives little hopium. Businesses realizing vaccines way preventing restrictions would hurt bottom line. Delta variant? whole reason Delta exists virus allowed spread unimpeded India.

The infections have, higher chance mutation. false. That's myth. headline incomplete misleading. story actually says “Less 1% fully vaccinated people experience breakthrough infection ***resulting hospitalization death***” — big difference! dad softcore antivaxxer. got shot, fuckin hates people are.

How work, exactly? What's argument? Thank deciding get vaccinated! made right choice. helping yourself, loved ones, community. I'm really hoping could least get least 1 million shots per day like two months ago. ass accurate data Yes, 95 percent everybody 40,000-ish people part study chosen representative whole population. average, anybody, efficacy calculated. said, medical reasons vaccine might take people, unless one underlying conditions resulting weakened immune system, something worry about. vaccination rates Florida? Mannnnn I’m less conservative “choose” side fucking stupid goddamn vaccine used fucking POLITICAL TOOL. Like today’s government would morons think that’s good idea. IMO vaccine 100% mandatory every single person USA/world receive it. Good luck minimum wage workers expected enforce this. know, I'm pissed CDC said vaccinated stop wearing masks early on. still can't understand virus politicized. ICU nurse called under-40's selfish generation right. got covid back october headache day, crazy effects people differently. glad okay though! Sorry Doc, missed whole anti-vax drama happened. past years, allowed opt taking flu shot. turn, wear surgical mask. co-worker since allowed. Well CEO pfizer said vaccine effective delta they’re testing another version targets delta variant.

That wasn’t media, ceo pfizer. Googled it. 96% physicians vaccinated. surprises 2/3 ones know vaccinated. good 1/3 country fears poor people, minorities, empowered women far fear uncaring society. A) kid too, kids seriously threatened.

Sinopharm effective BioNTech/Pfizer. let Sinophobia triumphing scientific facts. anyone Japanese language source detailing people get vaccine? mom takes Covid seriously. wears masks, gloves, sanitizes everything, etc. However, think vaccine safe can't really explain detail English. honest, don’t follow logic scientists quoted article. would best outcome COVID become endemic—highly contagious rarely lethal. fear surrounding Delta variant mutation went WAY—more contagious lethal. departure influenza model. Thus, confidence COVID become endemic might misplaced. would ever say no? given? make good points. ultimately, unanticipated positives come far. think we've become lot closer family. spend much time together enjoyable. snippy one another. Also, kid developed strong interest music. music making software he's figured we've using monthly childcare credit buy drum lessons. likely time really begin appreciate music school whole time. Yeah it’s possible Pfizer Moderna testing now. wouldn’t possible? Gotta stop headlines using total vaccinated population denominator bluntly claim vaccines effective. 5000 breakthrough week ending July 18, 200+ hospitalized 80+ death. That’s far cry “if vaccinated, COVID you” Anyone waiting clinical trial end I'm at. lost job Covid first really hit US, stayed locked four five months, went got vaccinated soon new job started it. that, I'm going go right back six months ago people get couple shots.

Honestly, I'm feeling mixture anger unvaccinated, hopelessness things never go back semblance normal.  true. 

When survey practicing nurses, includes nurses don’t work hospital settings, number closer rest nationwide vaccination rate. 

Practicing doctors studying medicine 10-12 years. get PN little 2 years. 

All all, practicing medical doctors know lot biology virology.   What's plan? Force Doctors Nurses work gun point? 
Eventually they're going start quitting / calling sick till eventually non-covid related illnesses begin kill people... Back could drink recklessly! shy talk Pfizer made damn difference. mandates winter people ""followed"" grocery store went home huge unmasked gatherings. It’s way combine _mild/asymptomatic_ escalate immediately _needing oxygen_. 

I tired last week, also little congestion sore throat… mild got tested going bars enjoying vaxx freedoms. (Negative) 

mild/asymptomatic helpfully combines perfect health, grass pollen allergies, one time ran 104° fever flu. 

Initial illness aside, long Covid really matters me. terrible People choose forget that. get one dose they’re going fully vaccinated 2-3 weeks agree 100% play side fear mongering. wild, kids resilient. really think get bounce back like never happened. real problem kids without good enough home life work well.

Everyone keeps ignoring fact kids grow rural, isolated, environments time somehow survive. wrong too. White Republican males getting vaccinated significantly lower rate black people people pushing particular narrative wanted talk reluctant black folks. stat useful (1) counts **only** people exposed (2) **equally** true Delta variant. Vaccines absolutely essential, make claims based incomplete data, disappointed play claims antivaxers. You; make wrong statement

Guy: shows wrong 

You: FUCKING CHERRYPICKER!! lewis almost got p1 back pack hungary 100% efficacy mean instead get milder version virus. 

And people got illness vaccinate got mild version disease. grandmother caught polio fine. hate mild chickenpox symptoms 3 days went away

Attributing vaccines already happening naturally incredibly disingenuous.  vaccinate everyone dying diseases. vaccinate dying. pains see every time US completely ignores places data live different universe.  know multiple anti vax democrats

That's issue though: scenarios described consistent data. vaccine could 95% effective everyone, 100% effective 19/20 people 0% effective 1/20 people. know one is? creating reality Delta 140% contagious. fun. Texas taking care Texans. Duh want secede stand own. Bullshit. god fearing politicians killing Texas.  Let problem solve ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Whites 28% Oakland’s population Yow. Wrong denominator. Using 95% vaccinated actual locales breakthroughs happened instead national average changes picture drastically. There’s fair amount people don’t trust “Tr*mp 

Kamala said take vaccine made Trump lol long time, ie evolutionary time scale. 

Generally well adapted virus humans, less severe is, still highly infectious, less likely cause dangerous symptoms. states among conservative, conservative states generally behind rest. 

Maryland higher percentage black people Alabama, almost much Louisiana. examples liberal states mentioned higher average amount black people vaccination.

In words, straight see true, still anything continue deny case admit wrong uncomfortable them. making things up.  Please list vaccines get milder form illness rather full immunity. 

If 6 fully vaccinated adults get plane 60 vaccinated adults contract covid, small snspshot high breakthrough cases really are. 

And discussion completely ignores high rate survival covid actually vaccination. risk already prior conditions certain age. Many people tested positive symptoms would known covid get tested. mean many people likely got it, symptoms, never felt need get tested. yes, care long term negative educational impact developing long covid children. months infection folks find battle get bed, let alone attend school.

Go take Republican style fear mongering hand wringing elsewhere grandpa  Wow comment history disturbing. Must heavy carrying hate around  would mountain task ask vaccinated people keep waiting indefinitely

This exactly. 

I see many people sub slam CDC removing mask mandate, else could people expect? roughly 2 months updated guidance current surge 1) incredibly low (and declining) case rates 2) vaccines freely available anyone age 12+. 

Even CDC would continued insisting everyone wear masks, would people listened? Count skeptical Thanks. might wrong seems homeschool Illinois unregulated even tell school kids pulling out. stand living room say ""I declare room school.""

That's... Interesting. Different places, different rules. sometimes almost none. see someone trying hurt store employee.. I'm running electric wheelchair.

Won't kill them, can't certain bruise.  anyone may see, @BNODesk posts daily vaccines US long take reach 70% population current pace. recently changed 60%. said, almost every US doctor vaccinated

Vaccine rate among nurses much lower though admit perfect comparison, hand. 8 months already since vaccines released. 60% US adults vaccinated, would expect much higher number deaths 6000 vaccine work.  I’m glad ended getting vaccine that’s took? It’s genuinely fucking sad. Legally defend lmao accidentally coughed ass swung gonna get laid pure simple .. really pick strange hill die pete's sakes.... know I’ll get downvoted oh well.

I hate “__% gotten one jab” headlines. Everyone preaches getting jabs build ample immunity. also numerous headlines reporting millions people skipped second dose. 70% first jab sounds good, doesn’t mean 70% both. even worse they're constant state training new people one knows they're doing. vaccine wonderful effective … masking still effective way curb latest surge. watch cnn speaking seriousness delta variant time now. fear it’s beginning end know it. least some. identify every day trump hats bumper stickers. It’s state agency I’m sure ducks row legally. Hell, even get back 1 million first dose shots day, maintain average rest year, would put country good spot. 

Say reach start September. would 122 days left year point, 122 million additional first dose shots finish year. would put country well 300 million first dose shots realistically speaking peak first doses. ""I'll wait 4.2 Billion doses far worldwide

""Yeah still think it""

Meanwhile, side family, staged three state cyber bombardment little pharmacy vaccine feb got 74 year old mom shot appointment. called “operation keep Mary Anne alive” magic number. Reaching mean immediately disregard mitigating efforts large scale. seems like trying justify apathy. I'm suggesting go lock down. maybe million teenagers sweating breathing returning communities greatest idea middle pandemic actively mutating pathogen. fascinating CDC apparently believed announcing removal mask mandates vaccinated would push people get vaccinated

To fair, can't observe counterfactual. well may even fewer people would gotten vaccinated CDC kept mandate.  Looks like training, teaching something. fyi, 18 days later, hospitalizations going lot many places. lagged.

  
California hospitals added 1,000 new Covid patients past week, substantial increase given number patients hospitalized virus last Monday 26th 3,595. Today reported number infected patients 4,772.   
Florida Breaks Record COVID-19 Hospitalizations apparently know cherry picking is. ""Look 50 states instead one city"" I'm actually saying. really struggle logic. science shows vaxxed need masks (and know different know delta, sake argument go it), ever wrong say publicly? 

This disinformation movement huge problem. can't cater perceived pragmatism. want part society. tests pretty accurate. False negatives super unlikely PCR test He'll fine. Alot people getting diagnosed PTSD due covid lockdowns fear getting infected. could quality quantity though fully vaxxed May 21st =) April good time get first dose seems confirm, live suburban Detroit. Detroit (Heaviy Blue) 40% Vaxxed, versus 58% suburban Macomb County (Moderately Red) 70% suburban Oakland County (Moderately Blue). Education levels, income levels, yes, race (think Tuskegee experiment horrors) play role hesitancy. love hate Facebook conspiracy nuts much next guy, people deliberately obtuse complexity problem. particularly surprising given mechanics behind increase. combination mutations double triple efficient virus entering cells combined mutations result Delta infected person producing 1000 times virus. prevent infection, creating hotbed variant creation?  completely false. I’m diabetic absolutely got destroyed Covid, much others fortunately. Sick two weeks couldn’t even smell rubbing alcohol. say, strep still way painful. Took jj shot March. Haven’t really noticed anything serious since. Hoping delta doesn’t anything me. Interpreting data. Wait comparing total amount unvaccinated covid death since beginning crisis months we've vaccine rollouts? Omgggggggggg it’s awful Man. want know antivaxxers say response this.

It's crystal-fuckin-clear point -- area low vaccination rates, high covid rates. area high vaccination rates, low covid rates. individual level, significantly less likely serious consequences catching it, catch all.

My dad softcore antivaxxer. got shot, fuckin hates people are. better ask tonight.  Supposedly last year, know bothered get tested coulda cold.

He learn anything though. It'd knowing right. right Probably tbh said ASU 75,000+ students heading way.  Covid would still around regardless. Delta variant India spreads vaccinated people too.

Getting everyone vaccinated good thing, regardless would still around. freedom take away first place That’s even nerve wracking. would saying something sensible pro vax? there's year half unvaxxed exposed imagine correlation anti vaxxers anti isolation/makers high, meaning they'd likely get case 2020/early 2021, right? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

That's bad reasoning. digits behind decimal point. Really difficult understand. let unvaccinated people ruin everyone's time they're dying. die want  99.8% people general havent deadly case.... sure. say months physical anxiety symptoms certain points - palpitations, numbness, et al, hours every day. get point. doc usually prescribe SSRI gets point interferes day day life. Luckily mostly gone away took long time really 'figure out' going on.

Again, trying diminish suffering, really bizarre similar sounds. FFS.. truly scared vaccine kids, least one parent vaccinated.


JFC.. Ofcourse is, there's whole lot noise include people, even ones infected, statistic. reason use hard interpret statistic steer narrative. much better ways communicate vaccine efficacy, like... actual efficacy? I’m NYC - lot folks still wearing masks stores transit (fewer 6 months ago, still majority). Plus, New Yorkers actually live mostly commute work otherwise stay neighborhoods part, neighborhood vaccination rates matter total vaccination city. neighborhood 80% adults vaxxed right now. doesn’t get tourists, New Yorkers (especially 30+) avoid areas lots tourists unless work there.

Lots first doses past two Come on. really going say straight face couple months trial long term arguing good faith here. Long term effects seen years months please change narrative considered standard point vaccine development approval pretend ok normal so. 

Also FDA approval political decision medical one enough pressure FDA full approval lets pretend second going go rigorous testing methods lengths time needed regular vaccines unless FDA also possession time machine highly doubt it. 

And fact mRNA around decades really selling feature safe FDA never approved treatment based tech before, around long enough success. Research field make less safe, research unless willing research test monkey.  know helps got couple months ago, new mutation get closer closer vaccine effective it. still wear mask public even precaution. pandemic feels like US taking one step forward 2 steps back. family stayed home 2 weeks done acting like pandemic beyond frustrated. Honestly 99% going survive. even death wish. We're also ""beginning"" feeling effects this. ramped much quicker previous surges probably lack precautions variant spread. 

I'm figuring week, maybe two we'll really feeling strain things we're going to. I'll looking data come Thursday see new cases look like. Early reports mistakes misinterpreted due fog-of-war. malicious actors amplify early reports support narrative, use corrections proof cover up.

Early details great public good transparency. wish way mitigate malicious amplification, though. I'd actually surprised make list required immunizations full approval. WV strict fuck something crazy like 98 percent uptake childhood vaccines. Plus, constantly getting adult boosters MMR, Tetanus, etc. doctors push vaccines like Michelle Duggar pushes babies That's true.

The source here: rate breakthrough cases reported among fully vaccinated well 1% reporting states, ranging 0.01% Connecticut 0.29% Alaska.

This *separate* CDC reporting breakthrough hospitalizations. totally see cases responsible parents end putting child risk misleading infromation. Say example parent immunocompromised kid, everything right quaratining keeping kid safe past year. vaccine came out, got doses.

Now move present, messaging vaccine breakthroughs extremely rare therefore chance infecting kid also extremely unlikely. Armed knowledge, easily see responsible parents relaxing restrictions confident infect kids fact, resulting increased risk kids result misleading messaging. pretty shitty. problem - attitude propose (knowing nothing 100% that’s on) - lockdowns, masks, business closures, go forever end time nobody ever satisfied we’re ready get back normal.  WORST part media tbh. comment either needs /s (R). Ironic posting support comment fact misinformation. think misunderstood comment mate. get rate discount life insurance, disability, health insurance policies since vaccinated? know wishful thinking still actuaries going mitigate losses determine rates? antivax rhetoric infuriating. so?  Bernie Sanders: “WHAT .001%?!”. considering it, got hit.”



Translation .... 'I want look like complete idiot.' That’s article said. call cdc reporting hospitalization go cite Kaiser health study. KFF analysis shows breakthrough infections kind also extremely half states report data Covid-19 breakthrough cases, states, less 1% fully vaccinated people breakthrough infection, ranging 0.01% Connecticut 0.9% Oklahoma.

The title totally correct. putting ""other people"" risk, children unvaccinated friends family(and think protecting them). buy story mutating coronavirus lead new deadlier version. time goes on, herd immunity increase. could deadly mutation, sure, could also deadly flu mutation. Vaccination much decrease risk. Yep, even start mandating air travel. Nope, isn’t really good data fatality rate. There’s suggestion it’s slightly deadly, minor effect deaths. big problem much higher infectivity. cases = deaths, similar, even lower fatality rates. Haha arguing 0.00075% *is* significant, pedantic terminology? mask mandates suddenly showing every liberal city America? Vaccination rates increase income, business owners executives likely vaccinated. I’ve seen anywhere else, seems... alarmist unfortunately exposure likely higher most, chances higher most. question this, personally. I'm sure anybody really bought 95% number, even 1 20 ideal world, know 20 people. Even number closer 70-80%, that's still lot people get infected. officemate shared space (vaccinated) coworker became breakthrough. fine. Israel puts number cases spread vaccinated individuals 20%, even superpreader sorry got it, hope mild you. Oh sure, vaccination mandates table let's that. could say they've encouraged vote supporting voting rights. I'm glad learning. *probably* Ok, doublechecked. 
88% mrna vaccines 67% adenovirus ones. 
Most Europe vaccinated AZ. mean, course, vaccines work help I'm stating far magic wand solution blaming unvaccinated much sub just... even word. Pointless? seven-day average hospital admissions 6,200 per day, increase 41% previous seven-day period, according Walensky. seven-day average daily deaths also increased to300 per day, increase 25% SAGE seem think happen sooner later latest report. also think realistic mutate variant significantly Oh 100% think something connected anxiety long covid. 

I C-PTSD childhood abuse panic attacks long term anxiety pains past correct *very* similar. anxiety never abdominal pains upset stomach weeks end though. 

Also anxiety/panic attacks intense chest pains, rapid heart rate, etc. short burst. Like 15-30 minute attacks. hours *days* long. vaccine still means lot, many people narrow-minded see benefits. 

You're far less likely die infect kill somebody else. helping protect people love, keep hospital beds open people sick diseases, etc. 

When people like ""having wear mask grocery like vaccine even matter"" I'm like ""cry river"" 🎻 sound rude. makes sense. People think differently respond differently. I'm governor state. can't make anyone anything. “How much longer wait virus mutates?” Again, virus mutating rate longer globally people want vaccine doses. long way globally, variants happen anywhere globe. thinking local virus global pandemic.

Off label use os different issue approval. might wrong comparing every possible vaccinated person total break cases seems incorrect vaccinated people exposure rates. 

Wouldn't get accurate result taking vaccinated people region like Florida getting break cases Florida?

That way looking least similar exposure rate? Took 25 years able drink tequila since memorable night Well obviously basically impossible without extreme measures. happens heart attack? happens house burns down? happens homeless? need food, medicine, need take care elderly parents, etc?

It silly ever think 320 million people could ever go 2 whole weeks without **ANY** leaving homes. Thanks reply. I’m boat, 1% higher expected better alternative course! Moderna Pfizer seem highest efficacy, Moderna likely slightly higher Pfizer. see people saying fast Ro value chickenpox burning way higher rate see. likely really soon. this! cannot fucking hear it’s “just like flu” one time. Learn basic science. flu easier avoid. spread AIRBORNE transmission. people get that? makes sense, given months ago used minorities least vaccinated group, white Republicans nations did. everyone mask neither viable.

A million times this. know people grocery store vaxxed. know am. solution wearing masks we're there, worthless honor system. get measles like Washington ~2017. 2018 made MMR hard requirement school. wonder closely wave correlates exact timeframe last year?

As ... 4^th July happens, couple weeks later cases peak, couple weeks later hospitalizations peak, couple weeks later deaths peak, back side wave.

No idea Delta changes things wonder much really another holiday-driven spike. “Civilization destroying situation” &lt;- laughable. 

A lot people trying deny think it, inevitable obvious endgame COVID going become endemic. bodies, whether previous infection vaccination, better able fight going forward. Children catch young build immunity then, fine know causes issues children. (This exactly like chickenpox hardly destroying civilization.)

Masks mitigations nothing delay (while causing social economic damage). may isolated areas would necessary (wherever hospital capacity risk) aren’t seeing concern much at, certainly widespread basis. gap covid recovery vaccination? idea statistically significant means Romans 14, specifically Romans 14:14 convinced, fully persuaded Lord Jesus, nothing unclean itself. anyone regards something unclean, person whatever believe things keep God. Blessed one condemn approves. 23 whoever doubts condemned eat, eating faith; everything come faith sin.

He talking food, generalized behave. Christian concerned action supported faith, performing action sin. seems like exact thing doing. Wanting control people make want. never information moderna shot? think signed form least good start. Something provides easy quick cause termination find lied. drive only. anyone else feel constantly gaslit now? So, CDC memo gets leaked, revealing knew vaccinated could spread virus publicly admitted it, facing complete return 2020 unless take drastic mitigation efforts. Yet CDC basically said ""What? No, happen."" mask guidelines woeful compared urgency memo, Congress rolls vacation cases rocket, Fauci basically saying ""whatever, get vaccinated"" breath saying dire days coming. expected pretend happening, want inconvenience anyone? I'm genuinely convinced I'm seeing things real. actually anti-mask. anti-mask mandate. Masks work. work well shouldn’t force absolutely everybody wear one. risk worried, wear one protected.

But yes old account. used use reddit, comment, didn’t sign years, recently. 25% world vaccine, opportunity time next year. 

That's great recipe total disaster.  Dumb question. Wasn’t survival rate Covid 99.998%? someone says ""personal decision"", correct tell ""asshole decision""

(Of course can't get vaccinated medical reasons, ""medical decision"") Australia cases low contact tracing effort high able map trains transmission. use QR codes CCTV evidence fleeting transmission

Eating anything McDonald's injurious health McDonald's without mask. absolute mess shit dumpster fire show! Anyone else feel like totally screwed unless something big changes FAST!??? Yes, bad thing.

Personally think sucks probably get boosters, like said, protect everyone around you, necessary thing.

I've tried best reason coworkers family, point I've accepted get personally affects them.

It's sad reality face, die, can't anything else point. Every previous hold knew chose get due delta. anecdotal story.  Interestingly, roughly 3 major wave cycle (assuming first wave much larger thought) similar Spanish Flu Vaccination mandated national level, everyone medically allowed, zero exceptions beyond that. enforced fines mandatory vaccinations apprehended.

And done months months ago.

Many tell wrong, evil, talk precious 'freedoms'.

But *enough* people die, enough young people die, gets worse clear never going end fumbling around 'freedoms', then... nobody disagree more. Wait see. prepare mourn. lot. Spanish flu also capable mutating forming variants. technology identify them, still variants floating around today. still burnt put. dallas would toilet hell house lol misunderstood
(its comment superficial dallas is...""nothing texan optics"")

i ""left leaning vaccinated folk""

It’s less chance higher efficacy instead potential smaller chance side effects (important least someone like somewhat medically complicated). point is....? Glad still us! idea might picked up? Stay well. True, opt flu shot wear mask season. mask option here. No?. Unless religious medical exemption part? Even vaccinated. I'd expect limit indoor dining well. That’s kinda cool!! bad tests aren’t accurate vaccine cards easily counterfeited Definitely buttery, fake waxy kind butter. received memo today. awesome. largest health system state, get ball rolling. Completely agree, grew frustrated, marketing terms epic failure.

Yes, did. said people identify nurses really LPNs STNAs. LPN *is* nurse. STNA not. correct say education different, many places LPNs work. Used also common see hospitals team nursing prevailing concept. RKI says Delta, need 90% people 60 vaccinated 85% people aged 18 59. numbers minumum numbers ensure 4th wave mild.

There scientists believe even numbers low. could go way around world Epcot! hospitalization rate vaccinated actually HIGHER unvaccinated study. sample size low matter, always strange cite hospitalization rate study also dismissing hospitalization rates. extremely unlikely animal pass polio human there's re-introduction vector like Covid.

I'm sick tired zero covid advocates spewing pure bullshit comparing COVID viruses functioned entirely differently hospitals overfilling covid patients? indication horizon ?

Why follow great Britain, see Delta wave peak weeks? Problem unvaccinated breeding ground variants could become vaccine resistant we’re back square one  Oh saying stereotype stuck well then. never know age person I’m replying to. think naturally default assuming everyone older long everyone was. Man, mom caught Covid back March hospital waiting unexpected aortic root replacement, big open heart surgery. vaccinated, eligible yet. came home get take care her.

It unnerving watch go it. told mild case, damn breath even talking. Got tired quickly difficult walk bathroom. around least little bit every single day exhibited symptoms. mostly quarantined one room, used almost two bottles Lysol week, wore mask (mostly N95) around her, washed hands often started hurting. Somehow never caught it. Got tested multiple times every one negative.

I got jab soon able, finally got last week. Sorry caught it. damn strange virus. CIA put vax bunch cocaine meth?

They whatever want seems like put power use. Licensed practical nurses absolutely nurses. Talk state nursing board ask them. Florida decide stop reporting cases headlines 21k?

This second day row Worldometers specifically updated FL. say so.
Just went 500k daily little 650k daily doses. 

But got 70% adults, much left vaccinate anyways. like rational conversation would change mind either. Honestly think that’ll change mind brain transplant Well, McDonald’s workers assaulted shot (or shot at) poor-impulse-control loser felt “dissed” got wrong flavour dipping sauce nuggies. feel awful retail food service workers who’ve tasked policing this. Hopium check classic thing minimize harm people older people people underlying conditions (which half US). 

I always assume trying make feel safer (i.e. ""well I'll ok""), often also used people argument inconvenienced hurts unworthy people. 

And yes, vaccines great, anybody get vaccinated so.  Yep, can't win elections battleground states constituents die Covid. ""I'm sorry, pay teachers enough hire ones pass covid students, pass grandma, killing her.

I'd quit spot, government abandoned mass sickness, lack resources, lack support . 


I'll damned go sacrifice life sanity  rich idiot politician wants look good next campaign . 


Not worth it, country treat medical personnel like heroes, call convenient business owners. doubt *thought of* party schools. association incorrect. Wasn’t saying anything bad Kaiser, complaints member. mentioning used different medical group/system get vaccinated available sooner fast easy. It’s weird conservatives love talk “things happen socialism” like power outages, goods shortages, people dying preventable diseases, politically mandated education, that’s exactly happens charge.

They must hang closet multi-purpose room damn fine projectors. far President even willing mandate vaccine military. Buttery salty? wear n95 out. Wth wrong people, Russia China must loving US turmoil Alford plea

Haha lets math, states 50 million extra right need every one shipped overseas since replace nearly instantly.

us purchased 500 million directly give, makes 550 million US using excess ones, even changing supply all.

EU giving 100 million (again without supply changes), counting individual countries giving away

if like chinese vaccines, giving away 200 million african nations.

i'm going continent continent google, realize US giving separate 55 million south america

japan giving away millions mainly poorer asian nations

india giving away millions less developed nations around well

australia giving away 20 million stuck contract buy certain amount decided need many.

back north america, canada giving away 100 million

us sending millions vaccines mexico.

count far billion doses means look every country every continent.

the problem poor countries infrastructure make last mile, speak. rich countries can't send boxes vaccines, need figure send trucks, nurses, freezers, etc etc etc much doses go rot He’s American psycho level pathology highest death rate nation right now.  Heard friend medical field think it’s better get booster different one get better coverage, FYI. don’t think number shots brings risk 0 though. first starts kindergarten year I’m due December second. I’m terrified fall/winter may like. “What cOmOrBiDiTiEs?” thought that’s chlamydia tasted like. 

I’ve lied to. hate use disposable. used cloth diapers disposable masks? feels crazy. However, cloth masks surgical masks source control I'm comfortable level protection provide wearer particularly fewer people wearing source control (masks). So, deal disposable now. 

One reason like site sales make get pretty good price. definitely expense though. really think (not trying fear monger), I'm clicking ""purchase"" seeing $$ think like medical bill would much higher emotional expense would entail well. HOWEVER, lucky afford it. absolutely privilege grateful for. also pretty much locked use masks every day. might work use every day. truly wish would require masks schools people could rely source control others. stands ton kids wearing masks if/when someone positive slowly filling room germs breathe day. I'm worried viral load going much kids. policy issue though individuals much change that. make best decision us given circumstances. 
Come vaccines 12!! them? state we're 70% total population least one dose, 82% people 18 up. We're getting close here. Even high school graduation class (2014) thought party school. don’t doubt great programs. found best programs least likely places. Scientists saying vaccinated people even avoid vaccinated people though we’re back square one.

No dunno man, live personally seen bunch (young) acquaintances hesitant get it. It’s much better incentive imposing mask mandates I’ll tell that. Yeah, nothing perfect large shown success local news publicly complaining masks less week ago. Probably zero it’s Alabama Vaccines amazing. I'm glad okay! Ah fuck government fails us private employers really wanted people get vaccinated, they'd provide additional paid time said jab (in order employees deal possible side effects). lot workers they're referring can't financially afford take week even days due potential side effects. many risk it. eyes, dead don’t vote

The survivors also proved they’re stupid realize what’s going easily swayed. set another boogie man they’ll never blame ‘their guy’ home person could like they’re Missourri- wear disguise get vaccinated don’t tell friends family! 🤦‍♂️ Darth Abbot Darth Desantis battling Emperor’s affections.

Are saying like bad thing? sounds like are. would happily get booster every single month, that's takes protect fellow human beings COVID. Yea die run course every virus history ever shown us. Nothing ever indefinite. something haven’t thought saying before, thank you! Yes that’s likely COVID Funny works rather concerning people take medical advice Fox News. many vaccinated? Fully vaccinated since April, pregnant (I’m one MANY conceived doses [after struggling secondary infertility *years*!] suck anti-vaxxers keep spreading misinformation vaccines fertility!) I’m going straight demand booster November/December pass antibodies unborn child he’s born, he’ll protection first months. Union says this. mean that's Teachers feel. wife Teacher, live area low vaccination rates, like 80% Teachers we're vaccinated minimal time available them. Many since, others medical reasons can't be.

Most also prefer mask mandates kids Vaccinated, least 70% HS level are. Even though huge challenge teach them.

I'm sure that's best idea, may backfire. Pfizer company giant financial incentives boosters. exactly don’t let drug companies regulate themselves. actual opinion public health agencies, Pfizer’s opinion absolutely worthless. now... friend died 30 minutes ago Covid. forgive fuckers never forget time history. It’s coming home ? really said contagious? explains misery saw India couple months ago. always keeping updated situation started much. like 20 lol. pretty fun tho. cities subreddit.. people complaining taste water, wondering contaminated recently. wonder reason since warnings issued. high vaccination levels, might people suspect Covid symptom. even though we're 70% experts said needed?

Also, we're 70%. We're 70% *of adults* least *one dose*. percentage Americans fully vaccinated 50%. nothing first amendment. ever seen media coverage inside hospital? media forbidden to. Public endangerment. Gross negligence. Dereliction duty. must accountability.  Same. Got positive result couple days ago. Felt like complete shit days prior. 

Feeling bit better required stay home per health department ten days. hardly surprising infants toddlers likely hospitalized kind respiratory disease. get bronchiolitis easily. expected Switzerland... buy it. Lots places followed China playbook. detecting first case, Peru locked hard early March:

* fill online form leave house.
* Men women allowed alternating days.
* retail closed except grocery stores, pharmacies banks.
* walking pairs, everyone must themselves.
* Masks mandated since first infection found March 6
* Restrictions enforced army streets.
* Also world's longest lockdown

Peru highest official death toll world, 0.5% population dead Covid. Covid cases took April, lockdown, never stopped.

Argentina same, extremely strict long lockdowns, universal masking, extremely prevalent spread.

Meanwhile, Japan never done much anything, besides masks. Basically even test, contract tracing, never closed schools, public transit completely packed, many restrictions early closing hours. Japan significant spread, currently highest been, Delta spreading, still tiny fraction (1/25th) country like Argentina seen.

And see story everywhere look region. Remarkably good results throughout East Asia Southeast Asia. Countries like Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam remarkably good outcomes.

The thing share geography proximity natural reservoir SARS-CoV-2, horseshoe bats endemic region. border Yunnan province, horseshoe bat sampled coronavirus 94.5% genetic match SARS-CoV-2.

There's way prove this, absent something like active challenge studies, convinced populations area existing immunity result past exposure related viruses.

You might say that's quite leap, honestly think greater leap miraculous contact tracing theory, somehow China able perfectly control continuous stream community transmissions entire time. Somehow Japan never major issues despite next nothing prevent transmission. feel this! adverse reaction vaccine high school, hesitant get vaccine. also health issues don’t make risk covid potential dx something least show higher average rates adverse reactions flu vaccine. know vaccines different, idk specifically made vaccine high school give reaction, cant rule covid vaccine wouldnt give reaction. know immune system amazing rarely get sick (i’ve definitely exposed covid before- lived someone days it- still didnt get it. maybe asymptomatic) close family members didn’t get sick. feel like risk vaccine virus. hope dont spread anyone get wish we'd see NY! lost 9 lbs several weeks battling covid.

Banned time variant hits children too. I'm sure backfire.  delta variant highly contagious kills 2 percent people get it. Considering vast majority people getting vaccine base seems like bad business continue path them. 500 500 many White House controlled could shown hospitals.

This fake. thing called first amendment prevents 24% us population 18. one going 99% adult population vaccinated. think different times. Yeah thought maybe waiting full approval. timing… either late early nearly barf thinking monstrosity. Jeebus. Yeah, that’s understanding well. go hospital getting tested positive shown hospitalized positive might something unrelated realize positive tested there. surely perfect; fact, 20 best 100 counties texas...alongsise 28 100 worst.


Given divergent sizes counties ( 8 8 million people) surface level mess lots reasons...an yet..bigger pictures appear data... Things worse reservations elsewhere, counties would expect see fail hard overall... NY woulda sermed like brainer start.


I considered adding another layer normalization... % total counties tge national average... Maybe tomorrow.


Also; weekly worst counties tells different clearer set stories overall county performance...and small counties less risk early time prepare... many variables. disagree mate. Rules certainly excessive even work. Locking people inside homes government deliver food effective current rules place. Wouldn’t excessive even work?

I understand government hasn’t gone far yet, doesn’t sound far that. question weeks ago. math says either way leads calculation 90% efficacy. answers got r/covid19 seems like generally 90% efficacy across board age-wise, dropping perhaps slightly elderly, would probably mean average slightly higher younger people. think fairly close though among different ages.
  
I wonder something beyond age though. Like people immunocompromised still risk. Maybe there's factor reduces vaccines efficacy for, seems like anything identified yet trials representative whole population sure downvoted… correct flu policy it’s valid question regarding COVID policy course, it’s something solved within one week. Sending something US Bangladesh isn’t different sending something Hawaii, without hiccups already. never said vaccines make masks less effective.

Yes, did. masks 40% effective top vaccine 5% effective (reduction 0.5%/the remaining 10% risk), means making less effective. explained, 94% would result numbers, vaccines make masks less effective. point still get vaccines *significantly* effective masks are. exact numbers, know, thought made clear.

Of course effective. mean masks top help though. exact numbers okay, example numbers show huge interaction masks go pretty effective (40%) almost nothing (5%) vaccinated. That's problem calculation - choose different numbers example, vaccines 85% mask 50% 92.5% total (50% remaining 15% reduced), vaccines 91% mask 33.3% 94% total (33.3% remaining 9% reduced), make sense. However, claim mask percentage changes masked, need show evidence. mask? Good got vax. Vax? Great still great despite fear mon gering. Vax mask? mean sure probably little effective, cases first went stratosphere? Like around November? People still wearing masks stores going home big unmasked gatherings, wondering got covid. That's gonna change. walking 10 feet restaurant mask security theater.

Obviously masks enough stop pandemic alone (the Chinese forcing millions stay home fun). However, expert view show meaningful risk reduction even vaccinated. Delta REALLY contagious, mask save little Timmy (but he'll almost certainly fine).

This fallacy certainty, defining everything either 0% 100%. That's world works, though. Masks reduce risk Delta, there's evidence wouldn't.   else ? know restrictions masturbation (only lockdowns completely shutting indoor activities works, UK done that). Delta contagious see would stop running hosts. part union, hate response. response lot pandemic unimpressive. Yeah doctor explained why, understand. left bit basically told they’d open I’m change mind got (or breakdown communication, knows why). huge deal, like said went pharmacy instead. point. point second sentence support first. comes certain public health issues regarding infectious disease I’m *closet* authoritarian all. areas I’m fairly boring Classical Liberal. even boring Classical Liberals 18th 19th century mandatory vaccinations.

Majority? antivaxxers getting Covid vaccine now?

I'm antisocial. one wants send 30% Americans live like farm animals afraid free choices. stop already, cracking up. I'm already fully vaccinated give right force others, like right keep away getting vaccines even best interest mind. closet authoritarian, admit sleep better night. US sending millions doses plenty countries months. country using 100% vaccines. 5 week old here, fortunately wife got vaccine pregnant studies shown antibodies carry baby months least. massive design issue inherent long haul COVID. self-report none current studies huge generizeable groups. said, acknowledged there's lot scholarship area that, right there, issue.

Sadly, better idea chances extreme symptoms answered question base prevalence. questions, however, really answered integral asking risk/reward trade reopening schools worth it.

I'd also love see studies educational outcomes students studied online vs students classroom. know measures scholastic achievement took nose dive can't seperate much online learning vs much living pandemic increasing rates stress, burn out, anxienty, depression, mental health crisises would negatively impact scholastic achievement. can't assume lowering grades due online class pandemic also explain lot that. could student's go back school scholastic achievement still quite bit case online classes surge areas may make sense terms harm reduction. New Oregon KP goes state. Also employee Permanent Medical Group happy decision. “Unless volunteer vaccine information wear mask.”

In reality, study three quarters (346; 74%) cases occurred fully vaccinated persons (those completed 2-dose course mRNA vaccine [Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna] received single dose Janssen [Johnson &amp; Johnson] vaccine ≥14 days exposure). 

To me, still less effective CDC rhetoric suggests, meaning imo, anxiey initial comment warranted.

I'd contribute two caveats discussion, extra fun **data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines** SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion COVID-19 cases. Second, **asymptomatic breakthrough infections might underrepresented detection bias. ** like covid 19 tested positive Lyndsey Graham. Vaccinations save lives even mutations. know transmissions happening gatherings anyway people going wear masks. goal vaccinate CDC goal made sense regard. point, I've given vaccines (I'm vaccinated).

That's terribly optimistic. Particularly given published efficacy. biggest worry latest CDC study demonstrating 70+% vaccinated still infected exposed virus, thereby also contagious, really concerns me.

I think there's bit this, would like see study. But, ""breakthrough"" infections, they're generally seeing mild symptoms, they're extremely rarely hospitalized (and I'm willing bet many ""vaccinated"" may stating as-much, so-as avoid.

Fully understand Republican states leading way. responding ""cherry picking"" idea Republicans vaccinated, clearly incorrect entirely helpful. good ignore facts help argument. oh, understand point.

No, vaccine useless (so far) keeping people mostly hospital one death, number people tested positive still concerning.

I understand mean, but, got vaccine told least (J&amp;J) 75% *effective* reality revealed 75% tested sample positive. That's concerning, it? can't pause society 30% idiots.

An example you. Say 1000 people exposed virus event 95% vaccinated. vaccinated group 950 10% chance getting COVID vaccine, assuming vaccine 90% effective, 95 get COVID. unvaccinated group 50 get COVID. Therefore 65% people got COVID vaccinated. mean vaccine useless? makes vaccine work better.

That's right there. Frankly, peer review garbage days. stuff CDC publishes journals total nonsense. sad Dr. Racaniello correct. restrictions reduce chance entire healthcare system running resources. stretched brim restrictions place less would even catastrophic. 600k plus dead US alone. Without restrictions would beds regardless need going hospital happen extent. Patient presents new onset chest pain would normally admitted overnight observation, well send home can’t spare bed. ...and tested, 74% infected vaccinated.

I'm sure understand point, I'm completely misunderstanding intent.

I'm saying vaccines working preventing infections. 

What saying? would consider avoiding hospitalization and/or death pretty wonderful effective. Ok % people vaccinated type vaccine get infected full dose? population Ptown weekend likely vaccinated Lol Civil war I’ve seen experts (maybe Gottlieb) speculate last major wave covid season. We’ll see guess. would surprised employer could legally request details. Anyone else notice attacks media like every thread. weird. Fraud, false claims, safety violations, bribery, kickbacks… hard believe even keep license track records like that. pop electrician, law firm, similar, would license pulled long time ago track record like that. things nearly bad worse death. Given Oakland probably conservative. care long term ramifications education loss. Yep. talking point months here. Let's hope Vaccination wins end.  Full vaccinated person got covid here. symptoms sneezing runny nose. felt like allergies. family girlfriend (all fully vaccinated) contagious knew covid. None tested positive. Trust vaccine me. May 2nd shot. Got sick last Sunday. Still sick, like lingering flu sucks. Can't imagine would like vaccinated. saying, I'm reading, seem two entirely different things. please break way understand? Must nice. got go 4 days wear mask job reinstated masks.

Fucking ridiculous. I'll make popcorn maintained everyone vaccinated they're vaccinating population day. feel sorry kids. Yeah, live South. Again, that’s false. US donated 110 million doses Wearing masks awful unless working physically demanding job hot, humid environment. Even people go home essential reasons would enough keep virus going, 2 weeks would explode lockdown never happened. We’ve entered age gene therapies, accelerated COVID19 vaccines. It’s good bet invest technology. uses potentially include custom personalised cancer therapies.  though. may well tell people never needed worry covid 99.99% people died Covid.

Just statistics tortured way aligns message want give, make tortured statistics ok. 2 islands (Yes, know SK technically travel NK SK island humans). Go look Hawaii's numbers real comparison there. know of. Alabama, Oklahoma, Mississippi thee lowest vaccinated states highest positivity rate. Maine, Vermont Massachuessts three vaccinated states lowest positivty rates. way would work America. realistic. COVID six months vaccine. 17 days fever several weeks fully recover. first MRNA vaccine knocked ass 36 hours. Well worth it.  need understand vaccines work though. PCR test pick single dead virus nose. actually evidence vaccine working, failing. don’t stop virus entering nose, mount quick defense prevent spreading body.

A doctor NPR recently talking need stop thinking positive PCR test breakthrough case. vaccines stop virus making sick. doesn’t stop virus entering nose. FYI Tunisia’s population 12 million lot. Afaik Italy France donated 1 million US also reportedly donated lot. Great news world, wish could vaccine mandate this. really interesting read. Thanks sharing link. certainly reasonable thought. means 30% maskless people supermarket lying. Dart guns like tranquilizing elephants. got vaccinated state. Thank work! Seems like many people I’ve asked they’re still unvaccinated don’t trust vaccine. sure convince otherwise. Well, remove 99/100 comments ""high-quality"" information sorely lacking! 80k italy (combined, across whole country). 80k/60M 0.13% population that's protesting. literally nothing.

The ""ioapro"" protest Rome couple days ago colossal flop. announced they'd 50k participants barely managed get 1k. kid newborn got april (and us too), barely felt seems. really young appear unaffected. Everyone school vaccinated, vaccine mandate. 

Nothing wrote remotely true. logic backwards. Companies weigh decision based many employees vaccinated. Companies (and already are) stating ""get vaccinated get out"". Employees *will* vaccinated offices reopen. Let's face it, CDC others government crap job beginning 'you need mask' message. difficult would say, pattern. Make masks.

Their lack understand people seems low. wouldn’t relevant number? honestly lazy I’m sorry. better late never. Tragedy Shakespearean sense character's flaws predictable consequences, right? anyone explain aren’t talking let’s address people getting vaccine matter are. Wait come 3rd (and possible 4th) booster shots. check proof vaccination? carry vaccination card you, going out? even republican, pro vax pro individual choice. singles vax brutal! shingles. hospital system allowed employees time recover vax--usually 1 day enough. work day second dose Pfizer--that doozy, bad shingles vax. read viral load increased 1000x delta. places everyone car. like NYC problem faith despite facts thinking.  heard reasoning well, yesterday big announcement hospital regional hospitals, requiring vax, get tested weekly. Doen't seem burdensome.  mean total amount vaccinated. another question efficacy vaccines, ever able achieve level vaccination make rolling lockdowns go away? Delta probably peak infection/vaccination rates reach something like 90% reported UK.

No idea long gonna take, 4 weeks sounds incredibly optimistic indeed. I'm thinking like 3-4 months. they’re fucking morons drank massive amount sugar, eat mountains trans fat, worried ""unknown substance"" injected?

If think it, protected point catching virus, probably large part, vaccinated, masked, distanced..... likely applies Jehovah Witness type groups I’m sure prove JW. account kids (12+ course) certain minorities lower vaccination rate broader population? 

I think look blue vs red you’ll see difference too, agree, that’s part unvaxxed problem. vaccines? Exactly articles claiming breakthrough infections incredibly rare according CDC data deceptive. Yes, majority small spillage due opened doses expire people show day, that's preventable US.

The difference EU generally distribute big amounts doses know expire, either within EU COVAX. US strategy hand dozens millions doses warehouses collecting dust, maybe something them, possibly. Covid’s new streaming service Even child behaves better people (CDC) even collect breakthrough infections data result hospitalization death

So they're really good source info breakthrough infections especially delta test Several studies shown like 75-90% Kind of. assuming groups except vaccine variable. vaccinated group likely people susceptible hospitalization, seniors, know got vaccine much greater numbers rest population. 

So unvaccinated group 23x likely overall hospital vaccinated group, adjusting things like age likely find difference that. Good Tell girlfriend random internet person thinks awesome! need mobile van going around poorer areas people trained talk people vaccines hand don’t get it. I’ve worked places required TB and/or annual flu vaccinations. also couldn’t go college proved childhood vaccinations boosters. Nobody cared then. everyone give shit covid vaccine now? take shut move pandemic already. That's appalling. large (pop. 3.3 million) urban county live 70%. Delta us still raging control. Except person wrong. anyone know data regarding schools opening cafeteria/lunchtime? county mandating students staff wear masks indoors one seems thought chaos cafeteria lunch. 

Any counties thought it?

I’m fairly sure fall going shit show. Booster shots available live, unfortunately. Good job, guess everyone get regular jabs starting end year so. 300,000 doses expire Germany September. 

Hope send abroad instead. general public. Lol. April 19 general. orange guy sneaked got shot January didn’t tell anyone.  arkansas, missourri etc. Theres many states backlog, hopefully data week looks good. good rule think point seeing entire clusters vaccinated people getting infected. stories ""my 8 vaccinated friends got together, 1 caught it"" - would meaningless. 
 
But we're seeing delta cut entirely vaccinated bubbles, often sweeping everyone one get-together, says lot well strain actually transmitting. 
 
[I know navy ship equal outdoor **everyone** ship fully vaccinated. infect one person. replicated vaccinated person, infected others. replicated *those* vaccinated people, spread others... 
 
Rt definitely seems among even fully vaccinated populations. That's fact need know. 
 
Of course growth curve way smaller unvaccinated curve. I'll bet ship unvaccinated would ripped entire crew like 4 days. important accurate assessment vaccine's efficacy. article says 96% unvaccinated, 4% mix fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated unknown. 

So math get tricky without knowing breakdown.

But given CDC 25x less chance leaked slides , that's pretty close announced last week Thailand would receive 1.5 million doses US within week received. Seems problem ship out.

I think logistics providers gotten quite good moving vaccines around world now. thinking risk vaccinated vaccinated transmission pretty low. course, condition places risk, maybe cautious.

Personally, taken destiny hands gotten booster shot. Look countries’ spikes, countries ahead us vaccinations ahead next wave. Cases infection up, hospitalizations high like last waves. Israel UK good examples. Looking Greece today, story. 

With said, southern US suffering vax rate lower parts US. hospitals full/filling up. already vaccination rates similar US

They're currently vaccinating five times faster relative Indeed. one thing island nation try zero-COVID strategy, gigantic country notoriously porous borders? Good luck... agree can't maintained indefinitely. hospital upstate NY same--if vaxed, need regular testing. mask anyway, much change. bunch anti-vaxers protesting ""medical tyranny"" outside hospital yesterday. hope docs pocket treat covid if/when get it. ironic thing many regional hospitals enacted requirements, leaving hospitals mandating vaccines. So, know hospitals greatest concentration unvaxed health care providers--predominantly nurses. want treated unvaxed health care individual. reading comments, looks like 0.001% redditors I'm sure would get vaccinated absolutely would lose chunk teachers (some retirement. new jobs). dont think people realize bad teaching shortage especially special ed.

Also even bigger issue teacher aids paraprofessionals. shortage even worse cant compete retail pay. general vaccination rates even lower many school 20+ behind already. I'd closing store week two paying employees meantime. want shop treat us respect get fucking shop “It bad,” said first wave, “but seems even worse.”

...yes? Hurry already. leads say things significantly worse? Depends mean ""stronger"", definitely much transmissible. grammatically valid perhaps? Wait wait wait part say "" thoughts prayers""? Asking friend  states? Covid back March, gotten back running well could least run 3 miles without stopping good pace. days, break runs segments matter fast I’m going. That’s tell people get vaccine, continue protect much possible it. lot children going grow without parents. definitely acting short term really do. immediate concern hospitals would overrun, bodies would literally piling streets. happening would happen later places. Coroners renting refrigerated trucks store bodies NYC example. scary. That’s “flatten curve” about. Keep base rates low possible aggressive action spread exponential already strained breaking. see people took mean trying snuff virus entirely. 

It’s also true near universal vaccination uptake, probably could go back normal, low level relatively low-risk circulation. continue happen return normal terms activity, masking, etc despite risks. hope get enough vaccine coverage hospitals overrun, escape variant sets us back square one. would nice could get universal masking too, use help get reduce transmission. Since know possible, adjust expectations accordingly. I’ve taking day week time, continues. research. sad however people voice like kids anti-vax parents. tells something important: overall risk dying Covid, given vaccinated. 

No tell all.  tells number people died population. Period. still A&amp;W basically survives nostalgia older people gets passed next generation take kids there. even open winter.

But kid, parents always kicking us house go something hung around sorts places threw us got boring. Pizza parlor, burger joints, mall, arcade, local parks, cemetery (weird know massive family crypt used sit watch sun set), even old quarry pond. 

Kids today really understand internet cell phones, couple us game consoles parents kicking sort shuts avenue entertainment (not much loss though, talking Atari 8 bit Nintendo). consider lucky options today rather disparaging us could little had. Unless grew big city, options really limited even going mall, arcade movies kind pain ass since get ride parents could drive. mean, look front efficacy vaccines clearly 98% told expect lockdowns vaccination rate high enough would make sense then, right? masks? Question is, number high enough... defeat smallpox again, could mistake destroy Masks mandated suggested.

Also 14% number, extrapolated entire vaccinated population 28 day period meant something like 99.997% get virus.

People need remember apply Bayes theorem population percentages, otherwise numbers meaningless.

Ideally 100% infections would vaccinated population that'd mean everyone vaccinated.  Hi everyone, someone able explain difference vaccinated recovering covid? body create kind protection work differently?
If latter, able explain provide article please? saw studies suggested would similar receiving booster shot. Herd immunity doesn’t come vaccinations. You’ve idea you’re talking about. No, I’m anti-vaxx yes I’m fully vaccinated. Reason: prevent variant emerging vaccinated individuals

Then let wear mask! Variants unvaccinated people parts world continue threat may even produce vaccine-evading variant.

CDC also states better vaccinate people rather giving booster shots already Soul mates? Used lecture hall 100 students. every lesson, one student 100 dragged tortured a' la COVID hospitalization style, would attend lecture. first released wuhan kill citizens order stop HK protests? release HK first?

Impossible guarantee couldn’t occur teenagers risk/reward analysis still required. would make sense sit something else comes along.

No, simply doesn't. risks Covid simply outweigh vaccines many times. literal hermit woods, sure bother. everyone else science even know work permanent basis


Irrelevant, work long enough benefits greatly outweigh specific reaction certain drugs

Vaccines drugs. far less likely cause reactions drugs made everyday ingredients body sees time (mRNA, lipids, glucose) ingredients last body hours only.


I know reaction is, doctor would able tell vaccine could possibly cause reaction. ask them? Since said could kill deaths linked allergic reactions vaccines, I'm guessing caused vaccines worried nothing. people legitimate medical concern specific available vaccines, based reality vaccine could affect them, understand someone opts out.

You've misunderstood basic bit news, explained comment. Perhaps shows trust epidemiological expertise much failed elementary thing? didn’t get first place. Never show symptoms. Never get flu shots, never get sick.

Even heavy flu season end much 10% infected. tons people long streaks getting it. end getting (and wishing got vaccines). anecdotal evidence worth much. part probably hard. country distribution may harder. folks voluntarily wear masks likely people vaxxed (or wish could be) still acting cautiously.   Damnit. Delta spread vaccinated people unvaccinated people. We're vulnerable loved ones. I’m sure quite understand position. union members can’t get jabbed could get sick despite getting jabbed. pushing every member get jabbed they’re increasing probability members get sick, possibly sick.

My buddy told majority people testing positive going hospital delta people double vaxxed. asked proof sent link that, credit, seemed real. Yet prove point whatsoever.

I sent link based real numbers BC, Canada around 82/67 vaccination rate said trust CBC sent 5 links news agencies. Mainstream media fake. Also one quick google search reveals: [CDC: You’re Vaccinated, You’re Safe Delta know going say response, 'get vaccinated.' course people get vaccinated, never said anything contrary. Well know that. friend went vacation several weeks ago. Engaged fairly safe behavior masked. things like gardens ate outside restaurants. got covid. Gave kid parents. vaccinated. Thanks summing keeping positive tone! Cheers! Nothing like China. Remember, China also sealed countryside around Wuhan forcibly locked entire nation. still know many people died original outbreak (unless trust official numbers, don't). 

The testing involves sort coercion that's wildest fantasies conservatives US. least first wave, lot people tried hide testing, tested positive (and exposed families) removed homes put quarantine hotels potentially-infected ride disease die. officials zeroed theatre Zhangjiajie, trying track 5,000 people attended performances travelled back home cities.

We'll see happens continues spread. Given China's population density failures Chinese vaccine, imagine going pretty much impossible control infectious type using previous measures. We'll see. Living Missouri, it’s clear since June breakthroughs common. breakthroughs knew likely caught vaccinated folks. Sure enough, CDC downplaying. They’re one thankfully mild cases even hospitalized one survived doubt possible without vaccination given health history. 98.5 99%....I learned round 5th grade. Notice call name elementary school level banter. LOL. PAYWALL BOOOOOOOOOOO Unfortunately due people storming back gates climbing fences thousands people never checked make sure either vaccinated tested place. 
We absence good stats moment though, I’m leaning anecdote. 
Basically, learned lesson back early 2020 forgotten it. Media film random people hospitals hospitals allow HIPAA laws, hospitals private organizations let media film. mean never see media coverage inside hospitals sometimes do. White House anything now, go throwing logic things entirely possible. I've seen bunch anecdotal reports informal surveys people reported long term symptoms beginning clear getting vax, that's far conclusive evidence I'm also medical professional scientist anything, knows? edited titles. stuff like this, prescription meds, 1 patient reports symptoms something, gets put warning. unless health issue, point talk treating physician, odds fine TBF, literally set country operate, largely, fashion. ended multiple countries form revolution, avoided *extra* civil wars. usual, little lose overly cautious vs less cautious. 
Assume worst hope best. 
I recognize don’t share way thinking though. 

If anecdotal evidence anything go of, I’d say breakthrough potential massive though. 
Simply way much uptick various subs vaccinated people posting family / friends got hit. Huffines horrid black billboards make look like eyes... good dude. see gold cup final? fear violence. ICU Louisiana's largest hospital stretched limit. Monday, 23 people waiting space open ICU, said Dr. Catherine O'Neal, chief medical officer Lady Lake Regional Medical Center Baton people chest pain sitting ER right families sit waiting room, wringing hands, calling everybody know,"" get ICU, O'Neal said. previous record 10,170 July 23, 2020. 10,207, Florida leading hospitalizations per capita. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis resisted mandatory mask mandates vaccine requirements, along state Legislature, limited local officials’ ability impose restrictions meant stop spread COVID-19.  Yeah. seems like way try piece together information. wish effort put studying could move forward making well informed decisions. I’m pregnant point assume need act like I’m unvaccinated it’s 2020 don’t feel safe otherwise. nice feeling safe vaccinated lasted. imagine vary school district. reading Coronavirus thread last night someone said EU countries kids wear masks schools wear properly/have masks designed kids effective. So, kids wearing masks schools probably going much anyways. Ventilation important maybe schools spent money now.  Damn that's unfortunate scarish. I'm afraid catch breakthrough infection proper treatments arrive. want feel free plague :/ ALWAYS operated assumption would breakthroughs 10 percent, why? Cause CDC. also aware time goes by, variants change, efficacy get less. know CDC. ... come wildly two different conclusions? Going lot cases next week. think talked lot, actually. I've heard many stories places like NPR talking efforts get Black population vaccinated vaccination rates low.

There's lot trust issues happening here. studies shown Black population likely get vaccinated talking people trust gotten it, like local community leaders, church figures, hell even barber shops pop COVID vaccine sites. ""their ability infect others 50 percent lower ""the risk confirmed cases vaccinated individuals infecting others 10 percent risk infecting one individual lower 10 percent""


This feels worth pointing U.s. alone total 3, count them, 3 deaths directly caused vaccines. make even better blood clots J&amp;J vaccine doctors know 100% preventable soooo.... lol

Source: CDC clickbait titles. clickbait titles. Maybe they're virus-sniffing hogs, kind like bomb-sniffing dogs Yup. covid right now, got positive result hours ago. FULLY vaxxed Moderna vaccine since March. like mean cold fever, chills, lots snot, wicked sore throat. poor antivax coworkers need get tested. hope get sick enough hospitalized worse. true all. unvaccinated, unmasked infected cases. didn’t be. looked comments I'm 100% sure they're kidding. voluntary manslaughter, offender intent kill seriously harm, acted ""in moment"" circumstances could cause reasonable person become emotionally mentally disturbed.

This attempt kill ""in moment"", premeditated thus murder, manslaughter. Nah. Vaccinated people still burden responsible unless / proven fully vaccinated people unable spread virus, IIRC case. good sign control group always been

but know 

economy human lives. america Yup.

Vaccines significantly efficacious masks (per CDC’s slides), provide permanent protections, leave less room error (e.g., ppl putting masks correctly)

With potential exception places nearly exceeding hospital capacity, I’ll never understand jurisdictions privilege mask mandates immensely better, permanent solution staring us face can't get back things used **now, when** we?

Isn't answer ""when"" everyone wants vaccine get one? Kids 12 still unable so.

The studies coming seem suggest vaccinated people spread disease asymptomatically - that's true vaccinated people also still significant role play mitigating spread disease af least months? Reinfection September getting December? family member coming visit September. 19 year old healthy female got COVID December 2020. refuses get vaccine. flying visit. risk catching again? household fully vaxed (except 5 year old). odds catch again? I'm concerned visit happen week 5 year old start kindergarten miss first 2 weeks disrupt social development new class mates.

&amp;#x200B;

I googled find reinfection data. Remember care workers peak pandemic? still don't. vaccination efforts continue stall? Probably. sure got downvotes. Stay safe. experience. stated kids virus factories best circumstances someone jumped tell different coronavirus kids BS. reemphasized point, patronizingly told must really young experience wrong learning science. Nevermind I'm twice age redditors following science since February 2020.

I've even seen people declare kids' mouths lower adults' infect adults. mean, that's air works, sure... Proof vaccination required: Check.
Voter ID: hard people get! /s kids able eat inside? wonder sustainable something like long term, covid forever. would people state country work? shot far past boosters start? ignoring natural immunity? generally curious go US, know go direction restaurants tired slowly fade away part everyday life. others said index card best thing bulky another thing people lose. might apps know huge portion people smart phones every person does. opinion can't see working well time tell suppose. got day Man. never realized excelsior pass thing (I live NY much northern section) I'm  medical experts thought BLM protests last summer safe…what measures taken BLM organizers could used keep lalapalooza safe? law COVID, he’s vaxxed. difference fever day sniffles mild sore throat. take put vent dying.  Except go Lollapalooza either show proof vaccination recent negative covid test, otherwise getting in.

By far foolproof system, we've seen plenty nations. festival 10.000 attending measures. 130 people covid (it unsure whether aware) got festival ultimately around 1.000 people attended tested positive, far know. many people living much fear. Logically, take kid COVID, take kid post COVID, likely die get seriously injured whole bunch things. Yup. think people realize remember monoclonal treatments EUA, like vaccines :-/ Make mistake, Tyson still terrible company care employees. want sick. tested negative 2 days later fever tested positive, vaccinated. goes 2 people got it, tested negative shortly fell sick.

I used spout statistics think things also ""It's likely ok, xyz""

Now concept anymore. Covid spread bunch people exposed person got despite ""breakthrough cases rare"".

I think underestimating delta variant, previous statistics ideas going tossed window next months. Surely Democrats also pro individual choice? make sound like bad thing? don’t want rounded injected will. reading still said, talking two scenarios past other. chance getting COVID general, whereas saying chance getting COVID scenario exposure unvaccinated person expected infected. yes chance less 20% general get COVID, would strongly influenced exposure risks. Vaccinated unvaccinated people zero percent chance never exposed all. still photo phone workplace required submit proof vaccination. I'm carrying around physical card though *will* either lose inadvertently destroy it. imagine places ok photograph I'm ok going places want carry actual physical card. must Republican deer couldn’t find listed anywhere. would mean kids 12 can’t vaccinated. I’m taking kid inside anywhere currently. shouldn’t happened. like olympics. honestly don’t give flying fuck “tired” everyone covid precautions. Music festivals privilege, necessity. way immune system works make antibodies sorts antigens come contact with, infectious not. 

It mean deer sick Covid family bit crap haha! I'm making menopause family history daughters Granddaughters gone bit weird 🥴

Incidentally, daughters experienced changes cycles first vaccines (one AstraZeneca Pfizer) double jabbed still experiencing changes.

No regrets regards vaccine though. Would mind recounting order took much time in-between got sick eventually? Unfortunately impossible here. Lots experts heavily implied basically risk vaccinated. Yes, technically say ""zero percent"", say convince people vaccine = safe. 2020 long year I'm pretty sure first ""gate"". multiple gates sometimes one beginning remind everyone get ids whatever required fest makes line faster next one. See thing suckers believe Biden criminal conmen told was. tell whoever Dems put forth criminal people like believe propaganda works rich incentive destroy Democrats/democracy. Happy Gilmer County, Georgia accomplish feat less hour now. providing anything back up. seeing this? plot twist ive read stories fully vaxxed people going walk vaccine clinics saying need second shot, less serves booster.

up want wait official authorization method, im sure well see months time. 

Disclaimer - doctor, get third shot saw someone reddit mention it. Right nightmare read watch news. 

People getting way better media. vaccine still efficacy Delta. Even then, assuming never booster shot update immune systems new variants. Remember subreddit called every warning Delta variant media fearmongering? Called every early sign infections increasing fearmongering? Said could never make dent US vaccination rate?

Also Provincetown Bear Week end superspreader event, even among vaccinated people?

Yeah obviously media missed mark ton times, mean consensus subreddit always right either. minimum, something ended big deal pre-Delta variant, mean ok Delta. Mandatory vaccines vaccine passports 100% happening. But, since going happen efforts made protect people's lives massive outdoor concert tens thousands people gathered stood right next delta variant, COVID19 general going spike massively US New York State already Excelsior Pass app New York City app soon, need carry card around. Variants still start large unvaxxed countries, like Brazil India. would long-term ban place travel. March 24th 20k cases NY. 80k cases usa. dont see news stories spike. 

I agree peaks go forward, states 'are treating covid seriously ' get lions share news coverage. implications horrifying. Don’t people go Lolla place? It’s like weren’t tons unvaccinated people flying states go, either showing negative test fake vax card That’s Pfizer developing. They’ve developing actual booster enhancements Delta. what's plan then, staying inside rest lives covid exist? Try living little carefree, go outside, smell air, talk human that's Reddit telling worry people outside hey sorry i’m little confused comment comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  app US? I’ve heard England one see quite often news never seen news widely used got real nice results. idea greatly appreciated. realize medical professionals seeing exact evidence are, coming different conclusions. I'm going side medical professionals, rather idiot reddit thinks interpret medical data better literal doctors. point said must common know 2 people. hold up. even consider reporting several responses came quickly experiencing similar. 
My daughter change; 18. 

Most respondents thread seem older women. 40 plus.

Ill let doc know sure. is, however, bedrock tenet legal system going far back English common law 1300s. need time machine.

In United States, Constitution also allows us freedom associate (and gather), right abridged crisis. rights absolute.

In addition, even ultraconservative Ron Johnson--who sucks--has said would support mandatory vaccinations hypothetical virus ""deadly enough."" few-to-no people taking position mandatory vaccinations always impossible. americans hysterical infections among kids? Covid nearly harmless kids. IFR 0,002% them. Influenza least lethal them. shit Correct. Moderna 4 week break two, guess people say 6 weeks make simple. hate comments say Trump would handled virus correctly, would easily election. Like….what???? forget trauma 4 years right start? sure haven’t forgot. wouldn’t election either way!!! Well bless hearts know someone went this. talked yet, someone who's right thing last year half, I'm torn right biting tongue telling really feel. I've ended many ties people shit gets tougher closer friends. matter say though; seems way they'll learn get infected. starts cascade variants popping up. fucked downward spiral. want ride; I'm exhausted. unvaccinated adult America right now, piece shit.  19% 2.6% breakthrough infections. 0.04% lol “even hate little bit” pfft hahah angry people making choices personal freedoms me. FUCK run risk getting sick receiving massive medical debt want breath face public. live prosper community others yet don’t want support system make best be? dont want participate making world better place? Fine, go make shovel dig well water. die pnuemonia woods celebrating “individualistic spirit” entire time. 

It’s become apparent personal freedom people care states freedom die…. could saved wall text. 

If offering advice peers way understanding situation, it’s typically best empathize rather point finger mansplain. 

how people raise children nothing you. Actually, kind expected rates plummet. Population growth pretty much anything (mice, humans, totoal infections SARS-CoV2 delta variant) follows logistic curve, exponential curve. derivative curve (its rate change, case expressed ""new daily cases"") symmetrical - words, actually expected go quickly went up.

Below link image logistic curve (the red line) derivative (the blue line). think many people get caught change gradient red curve middle obvious, shape blue curve unexpected.

http://photo.alioth.net/tmp/Screenshot_2021-07-29_09-40-45.png

If ask people eyeball red line say ""when rate increase start decreasing"", they'd probably guess x=2, fact x=0.

What might unexpected peak relatively sharp, happened earlier doomsayers said. hospitalization numbers show reality. I'm teacher wanted us seating assignments contact tracing purposes. 

Uh.... going trace people contact halls 1700 student school? outdoor event people gonna fine

The vaccine work know everyone bashes DeBlasio, think he’s taking exactly right steps Covid past 2 weeks studies show otherwise. ""report"" payroll company bought fact. outdoors, right? pretty much risk. true Let die learn vote. Gotcha. Yeah used enjoy Chicago festivals mostly big fan city. didn’t even know bonnaroo happening year! tickets David Byrne headlined decade ago sell mine. protests last summer never amounted anything terms cases. Outside events fine tbh People always choice. want work company, always another company require vaccines. students attend college online refuse get vaccinated. ""Could""? Exactly. incredibly slippery slope shocked come this. put many small businesses business. laminated mine dose 2 case this. held well! always get issued new card subsequent doses need worry that. Considering type people still willfully unvaccinated, would love assurance anywhere near me. would 3rd dose already got..  clear \~50% fully vaccinated population enough stop hospitals becoming overwhelmed. need lot more. That's optimistic take I've ever seen. never convinced 90+% humans absolute shit. still happening even today! irrefutable children get it, turned to, ""OK, many harmed it. LOOK CAR CRASH STATISTICS - THEYRE WORSE"" makes OK. lot states like that, Florida nine top-100 largest metro areas population US. Plus others like Tallahassee, Ocala, Gainesville, etc. exactly small either. Additionally, however many hundreds thousands tourists seasonal residents state given time. point stand functional density people Florida probably higher traditional metrics would suggest. apply children eligible vaccine? learn months ago apparently outside gatherings perfectly safe? gaslit here? ""based new analysis hiring data Gusto, company handles payroll services small midsized businesses.""

Now real study. Pfizer. even arm soreness J&amp;J. Lack testing, lack international trade travel.

Brazil Peru huge travel destinations. fuck vacations Mozambique? People tested and/or vaccinated fun outrage!

Vaccination finish line. Yeah, exceptionally small chance breakthrough exists, there's nothing vaccinated people that. We've done part completely acceptable get back real life now.

Focus unvaccinated untested. They're issue, they're allowed Lolla.  confirm. hospital pharmacy sends us near expiring doses daily ED urges us see patients want vaccinated. Nearly everyone refuses TN can't believe people unwilling 3rd shot. Taking work cause vaccine best. naive understanding viruses thought threat would nil. Many people *don't* want return office actually incentivizing *not* vaccinated...  Maybe also lot closer true people vaccinated mix sane people sho also vaccinated people aren’t don’t. Stop making excuses people grab hold literally anything excuse. makes lot sense, weird policy decision state's part. Thanks perspective, Mike. right. us act like assholes front line works. dunno. part afraid small risk dying, bigger part afraid bigger risk living. Jesus spoke frequently evils mrna vaccines. pay unvaccinated minimum wage. survive traffic houston, good luck evidence much contagious, viral loads much higher. 

What evidence coronavirus' become much much stronger, like MERS, potential deathrate 50% question. 

We need put lid species quickly. almost like India ten day festival river ganges, everyone got Covid entire medical system collapsed. bout COVID November. felt slow time. I've never pregnant, mom told me, COVID brain-fog seemed kind like pregnancy-brain feels like. really start getting better got vax five months sick. (Plus, since COVID, first time life, need inhaler whenever exercise. sucks.) kidding me? Texas loves Abbott, that's keep voting him... I've heard single negative word people know republicans, democrats either care, like Yeah he's denial. Try asking : would mean covid actually serious people/govt saying? would mean world/you?

The reply get back telling. might find attached worldview issue. might find motivating keep antivax/denying articles. right I’ve wondering along. tracking breakthrough cases according vaccine taken, so, aren’t getting data? But... fearing vaccine vaccine ever given 100% protection anything, like contraceptive prevents 100% pregnancies. It’s ‘poor messaging’ fail read ten pages small print every time make public statement. know might get us closer 100% protection? people stopped quibbling stupid things got vaccinated help cut spread production new variants. excuse. (Other medical inability vaccinated). School closures happening anymore CDC American Academy Pediatrics recommended in-person schooling mask wearing K-12. Remote/online learning also removed option many states. think parents agree accepted this. rub despite CDC/AAP recommendations mask wearing K-12, handful Republican led states banned schools requiring masks students - often threatening withdraw funding. could done start nah need see belive something goes wrong vaccine responsible again? Oh gee poor people getting vaccine? Probably can't afford anything go wrong. Virginia good job capturing percentage people vaccinated/unvaccinated admitted hospital: restrict statistics date. July stands well 90% hospitalized unvaccinated. got Moderna, husband got Pfizer. Going side effects experienced, I'd get Pfizer. 

I know everyone different blah blah, barely headache sore arm day. Mine bit that. still fine 36 hours shot, either way dreadful.

That said, I'd get whichever easiest get. got mine, Moderna offer soon could get it, that's got. they're assholes is, actually know right? New exciting ways screw up. worst part is, interconnected problems poor response affect us too! Same, mom 80’s I’m willing take chance. kid starts kindergarten Wed. Luckily city revived mask ordinance. Unluckily, I’m southern state says unenforceable it’s dog pony show. However, everyone school masked up, including kids vaccinated people. folk mad it….I’m glad kiddo gets go school. “Two wrongs make right,” comes mind. case, two bad public health decisions make either less bad. lol ""could"" disruptive moment. small number people actually locked consider total population. Life still normal country.

If breakout containment continues successful, think proof know they're doing.  Unions would never million years allow especially NYC unions gigantic ask conservative friends 50% never go lol second bullet topic's CNN article gives .01%. Maybe article wrong! headline overstates article's data 100x.

Your link directly give share vaccinated people breakthrough text, think may misunderstanding statistic interest share cases among vaccinated people, indeed couple percent. article's Table 1 present data needed recalculate CNN article's statistic, broken state never totalled, need export table add spreadsheet something. thousand times virus load delta.  guess happen literally Congress. explicitly said she'd trust vaccine experts supported it, there's nothing irresponsible all. CDC *did* heavily suggest extremely unlikely told us unvaccinated people didn’t need test exposure unless symptoms. variant infectious previous variants. caused ""collapse"" india's healthcare weeks ago.. think facing too.. 2022 Texas gubernatorial election November 8. Pass on. truly believe people gotten booster dose 14+ days reunion, infection rate would cut 99% vaccinated group zero hospitalization… Pfizer said immunity starts wane 6 months need boosters… ignoring company made vaccine? Health authorities using blanket language like ""you're protected vaccinated."" course vaccines provide blanket protection that's people interpret that. suspect health authorities chose language purpose persuade people get vaccinated.

Also close right time Alpha... True! admit they're wrong way harder admit it, means world live something different believe in. I've heard many antivax people attach whole worldview denying severity virus, point difficult get admit they're saying ""I want live world ..."" feel comes that. admit they're wrong that, admit worldview real least incorrect. get someone admit one difficult things ever. think, lucky, insurance. 

I suspect increase bankruptcy filings next year so, though, given medical debt one big reasons already. patients, series estimated 10%,1 prolonged, multisystem symptoms evidence organ damage dysfunction.

Interesting.  covid protocol, know enforced.

Plus, risk event itself, travels after... far fetched scenario, severe reaction vaccine... 

I know r/Coronavirus really likes vaccines also think they're best option fight pandemic. health impact receiving vaccine comparable impact donating blood. One person know died heart attack two days vaccinated, one went ICU myocarditis, I'm still feeling quite unwell week second shot. That's blood-donation level side Also like blood donation example, people donate bone marrow that's significantly riskier.

Ok, people donate bone marrow. kind appeal good chance work goal convince ""100.000 people"". need ""90%"", won't. got worse last winter entire medical establishment country lying teeth vaccines don’t work (for record don’t think that’s case, really doubt it’s worse last winter, last fall even) looks like people variant dooming honest, data suggests vaccines incredibly effective preventing serious illness... people realize there's brakes train. peak last year preceded slowing downturn numbers. right going even hit peak we'll see similar turn.

whatever happens summer florida blow away last summer I’ve lazy get it, think I’m gonna go since I’m seeing offered various places near me.

Just stuck whether get Pfizer Moderna Meanwhile Texas children's hospital packed. I'm glad I'm excited prospect lucky heavily implied take vaccine made Trump least. irresponsible never encouraged behavior. delta? Excuse lack knowledge I've tuned covid news couple months think best way lay people track right Virginia dashboard: tells percentage people three major categories (cases, hospitalizations, deaths) fully vaccinated. also restrict date range want. three cases, 90% July.  made laugh.  Minimum 15,000 infected turds see Limp Bizkit. 


Hahahahahaha! point, choice have?! think delta blame this.. white, Republicans less education?

Source: looks like might peaking week yeah school without masks going curveball. hard say big numbers get happens. CDC breakthrough stats show vaccinated fatalities chunk are: 1. incidental positives (ie, Covid didn’t cause death) 2. Immune compromised. everyone leave lack vaccinations black hispanic communities? really think significant chunks population historically voted Democrat suddenly Republicans? That's raw data afaik, says nothing collected, what's control group, people get tested etc. live horrors universal healthcare, good education, livable wages, freedom choice!

Wow, Texas! sure showed us! university NC mandated masks indoors starting yesterday. Wish they’d mandate vaccines it’s state school well, North Carolina. 43% student population self reported vaccinated(hopefully number higher students haven’t bothered turning proof). keep hearing isn’t true. live chicago thing changed advisory wear masks indoors everyone, announced last Friday. restrictions proposed put place.  initial reports massive hidden deaths wuhan ever disproven? Hi Reddituser34802, I’m Mexico, pleaseeeeeee vaccine? Murderer Kentucky says hello. pulled kids yesterday. Can't believe we're again. issue either finding pod virtual tutor. 

During schools virtual open house question asked regarding social distancing lunch. answer ""we'll best, xxxx kids, opportunity social day."" So, crammed masks eating. noped hell out. I'm calling schools forced back virtual 9/13. week two ago think saw youtube 100% unvaccinated. one hospital. city wide numbers... China tested city 9.2MM people three times! going something similar again.

Had US ever done form comprehensive testing? ever year people show hospital? exponential curve bad old COVID. Way, way worse delta variant even percentage people vaccinated.  Wow, that's crazy. I'd imagine y'all want shit I'm somewhat optimistic sense we're quite highest peak back Jan 4K deaths day (and 200K infection per day).

I think looking Deaths % cases relevant new cases new deaths. peak last Winter saw rolling 7-Day average 260k 3300 deaths, 1.27%.

Right we're 86,866 cases 360 deaths 7 Day average, 0.42%. cases upswing, deaths following similar path, think absolutely case optimism. 

This time last year less cases 60,434 7 day average, 1071 deaths time period, 1.77%.  appreciate thoughtful response recognize validity saying, even still disagree. Whether desire punish rule breakers change anger comes fear. definitely observation people worrying kids fear, mention. physicians saying platitude all, platitude intended end exploration subject without thought. article meant start exploration subject.

I believe reason get angry bashing whoever want define ""other"" ""stupid"" (or least stupider ""us"") there's much stuff killing harming many us constant, daily, yearly, decadal basis. many clear factual bases could fix supposed smarter ""we"" claim ""believe Science"" ignore deny every bit much people Covid. Whether health care, homelessness, prison systems, gun violence, dropping nonstop bombs brown people, food insecurity entire planet fire refuse anything except sit asses complaining politicians. represent us, rule us. culpable. body counts make Covid look like nothing. Yet gall blast people morons feel righteous anger equally culpable willful stupidity refusal develop self awareness help world.

We're right electoral system suppressed degree seen since lifetimes. open, hidden. we're anything, even though cascading legislative, judicial policy ramifications absolutely impact things worse responsible real way death tolls concentrated suffering future dwarf Covid (but also include Covid). hypocrisy cosmic, outcome keeps suffering killing going even worse.

I admit set comes up. stupidity self-professed ""smart ones society"" nauseating. article based physicians entreating us look deeper minds purposes healing getting almost nothing responses ""actually, we're justified hating right people blah blah blah."" Mama mia, really bent developing self awareness terminal degree. Yes, often case degree get angry directly connected degree I've observed guilt regard lifetime. Getting angry stupids completely ignoring I'm similarly culpable, refusing uncomfortable work grow order actually help. Seeing complete lack desire become aware folks claiming much smarter frustrating. “But Covid vaccine makes magnetic.” test though? may tested soon. good test days 5-7. access rt pcr? Florida hasn’t peaked yet. School starts county next week school get funding mask mandates kids parents screwed. It’s bad may dip, come back later august. There’s way around it. like regular Delta added mutation. kinda like getting extra shot latte?  like Trump ad trying scaremonger ""Life Biden"" using footage taken administration. Yeeeeahhh uber conservative family *quit great jobs mandate.* complain ""lazy liberals"" ""don't want work,"" quit vaccine ""is sketchy."" It’s almost like letting people fear monger spin propaganda vaccine it’s safety bad idea Yep. McDonald’s right around corner junior high high school, parking lot usually pretty slammed school let out, people meeting later.  good place congregate, buy pot parking lot, pass around bottle back someone’s pick truck. 

This 90s, look movies decades before, apparently hanging “burger joint” new all.  people eat, honestly fact sell food reason won’t run loitering. honestly can’t understand keep throwing bus.

RemindMe! 1 weeks undoubtedly Denver city employees attitude, getting fired ineligible unemployment. Homer amending statement: ""He going let mostly people would vote die."" silent conservatives like call them. Smart enough understand science smart enough keep opinions bc know unpopular. Got extended family members like that. Nice people, smart never guess vote R line think confusing people wanting pandemic protections end wanting pandemic end.

I hate people can't honest say arguing try ""pandemic unvaccinated"" thing. 

And honestly, see argument, fully convinced it, least makes logical sense people least admit ""vax out, open up"" intrinsically tied ""we best can't get vaccinated lot die."" Notice mandatory vaccines similar old days mandatory masks… eventually mask wearing became commonplace…ok happening. Nah [you're fine let hysterical Karens leave house bother god's name dumb enough state outlawed mandates healthcare beyond ne proves point covid never going away.

12% blacks NY vaccinated. rule made 88% blacks NY get turned away businesses. earth see parents wanting kids school bad thing, let alone ""not wanting children first place"". School f-ing day care, education super important _for kids_ parents! definitely part issue. Except laws get enforced police officers employee really care enforcing them. Yeah much ask consumers reduce water usage beef industry major offender. Since vaccine seem work, natural immunity way go. question technically necessary given control state underlying communications infrastructure.

However little reason state adopt QR code based check systems. 

1. conditions public accept measures (which I'm sure Chinese government finds desirable)

2. cross check information one source identify reluctant individuals. mention go restaurant brunch busy ever. church absolutely packed. 

No mask sight. That's outer security area. Lolla multiple levels security/gates. highly doubt kids got fest. did, antivaxxers ruined everything mean way check it. vaccine cards meant identification cards. never meant means test.


Also probably 80 90% security this. It’s scare actually secure anything wtf lol. ridiculous. get wrong, I'm trying downplay donations. think, however, assuming reason US send Pfizer vaccines lack infrastructure receiving country may accurate everywhere. live one biggest Mexican cities, remember older folks vaccinated Pfizer. everybody using sinovac astazeneca. Great Inconveniencing begun.

Good, let people get annoyed realize need team player want participate society. *colds*, mister! love this, hope cities follow. Better yet, entire states need this. like feel superior. I'm jealous people I'll pile on. GA mad too, particularly elementary schooler cant vaccinated yet. masks required, distancing, lunch cafeteria like normal, vistors volunteer mask vaccine requirement. ridiculous. cares Outdoor concert majority attendees vaccinated? Massive super spreader event. Giant protests last year vaccine? Totally fine! would 100% vacation Mozambique 

Speaking Ethiopia, another factor may people also outside exceptionally well-ventilated spaces almost time. Though would expect transmission average bus ride. even online course, lol. short window weeks job, haha never period finals week college 40 years ago. Stress cause. here. I’m anxiously awaiting novavax. wear time can't exactly vote Desantis next year, I'm sure ""learning vote"" going helpful. Thank you. Thats good news plans give front-line workers get vaccinated $200 bonus, addition current policy providing four hours pay getting inoculated outside work external provider.

But November 1st? Hopefully vaccination events onsite. people expect many people needing risk prison rock concert [Chicago hit 70% adults vaccinated month complex, difficult procedure make advanced vaccines (so read). take lot skills break laws. That's reason them. This.

Also, local outdoor venue, there's signs get - 

""Masks recommended unvaccinated. required vaccinated.""

Of course, like add ""or liar."" end that.  Virtually ONE wearing masks. hard time believing many people venue are/were vaccinated.

Unrelated, unvaccinated co-worker two days. Today fever.  bode well. likely $work require get tested. bet Delta. won’t live like last year.

Look way rolling lockdowns work China. would call normalcy. masking going on. would make sense IFR lower test everybody entire city track cases get infected people early medical treatment. Also response bias “representative samples” countries people get covid getting tested frequently, makes IFR look higher. Get people want live lives. Go shelter bunker you’re still scared late it. Human evolution didn’t come far give No, I'm saying much hate gatekeeping, will, fact, engage issue. right. same. people described ones would lie say fully vaccinated wear mask.  Bruh Chicago. [they actually hit Biden's July 4th vax target month Every day another new record. never even thought that, puts crazy spin it. would good see many people ICU COVID fully vaccinated age 50, I'm guessing insanely low. Florida decided exclude non-residents (inc. tourists) numbers June.

So folks trudging around Disney ""summer cold"" arent counted. vaccinated? Yes inmuno-compromised due and/or disease, PPE pretty much 100 percent effective used correctly use spending extended time close contact unvaccinated indoors. faking white index card takes lot skills , especially accept photo card. already point honestly. Vaccinated people spreading delta, aren’t hospitalized mostly. don’t want vaccinated accept risk covid that’s that. business decide customers turn down? 70% whites NYC vaccinated vs 12% blacks. Yikes. sounds horrible. Thank though story. Good Yeah, Lolla disappointed see lax checking vaxx card. Though Thurs guy front turned away go get test 2 weeks since 2nd shot.

Also, requirement better nothing. tons people r/Lollapalooza trying figure get vaccinated get test lead fest. Plus Chicago India (as saw someone compare) Deep South nobody trusts Yeah deaf coworkers. really hard them. different wearing mask office cleaning hotel pools, laundry, construction, kitchen work, etc.

This really gatekeeping different experience. Lol there's around 30 percent vaccine hesitancy US, Brasil around 10 percent. Also around 47 percent total population vaccinated going go real fast vaccines arrive. one came premature ""let's Vax ppl unmask even we're 50 percent"" like US, lead literally everybody else wearing masks anymore. Watch country start pointing fingers. Although India's situation damn near uncontrollable 1,3B ppl, they'll never able vaxx control mask wearing/social distancing. yea India specific case certainly breed variants, like delta. seniors. Delta aint screwing said **50% people hospitalized ages 25 55**. also said 96% people hospitalized difficult? think people stupid would buy pre filled card doesnt even name it? theyre almost certainly blank purchased. even great evidence airplanes high risk. airflow exchange airplane insane, one places mask wearing federally mandated strictly enforced. catch COVID environment vaxxed, literally everyone masked, entire air volume turned every minute two basically hopeless you. Reversing supply chain difficult sent far outlying pharmacies. It’s like countries things close together. It’s really fault people using them. J&amp;J would easiest reverse due long shelf life storage except they’re seemingly reluctant reason, easily moved high infection areas within states little trouble (Arkansas this).  Yeah India = Chicago basically 1:1 example vaccine/test check door article 2 days old.

The current number hospitalized **11,515.** standing running anything

They probably think you. Canada  Since thing “CDC mask mandate” article cannot news part WSJ. must opinion page meant sensationalist. posting here? know Florida crazy that. close 50 pct. fully vaccinated rate. Could fact crazy hot right something it? mean pushing people indoors. worried might sign come northern states fall gets cold everybody goes indoors. thought. certainly scientific basis anything. guesstimate based selfish people comes anything, even pre pandemic. Everyone's acting like republicans shit tons Dems centrists huge pieces shit boosts numbers head. seems close empathy others unless someone gets something whether high horse personal gain etc. could never convince country pack isolate 3 weeks snuff virus. Even got every anti vaxxers board vaccinated would still screaming ""I got shot need mask care anymore!"" Despite countless stuff coming still spread peoples lack giving shit future varients. little faith humanity pre pandemic prolly would said 80% people shit back then. reaction summer protests pandemic bumped 90 me. want go hermit somewhere middle nowhere point. desire around people anymore small handful family. ""labels""

What?

Is challenged? Call people ignorant rather provide proof back position?

I sorry, report private payroll company study proof anything beyond click-bait.

If actual study happy read readjust position. Clearly case you. prefer get upset lob insults.  feel like stats thrown breakthrough infections extremely undercounted. Feel like I’ve heard lot people talking “summer cold” days probably don’t want take time get tested feel obligated quarantine they’re positive New York expected announce vaccine requirements indoor activities (indoor dining, gym, performances, etc) too. Although think making opposite points. can't ban her, require stay outside away everyone else. Months pro-covid policy finally paying off. also appreciate that, aside TINY number people, one would ever predicted pandemic would look like this

This quite funny me. happened China everyone thought ""that's China"", happened Italy everyone like ""oh that's Italy"". happened Spain present dropped me, pretty impossible convince anyone England due Southern incompetence, fact going happen here. Worrying. Funny, got J&amp;J knocked ass. five hours couldn’t control body temperature everything hurt. gone almost instant. good news continuing countries began case wave weeks us, great. US itself, actually states began wave earlier rest country (namely Missouri), we're starting get clearer picture R-value graph looks like, currently 1.02, July 5th peak 1.34 (the all-time peak 6.17 March 7, 2020). Given this, we've seen European countries earlier case waves (UK, Holland), reasonable assume cases begin decline later week Missouri. rate decline probably work model fast slow low-vaccinated southern United States get back early June case levels. fast Holland UK, could within pretty short timeframe Again, using death bad outcome.

CDC guidance safe parties vaccinated. case here. change mind. wonder point become fearful prospect living prospect small chance dying. thing is, people disagree Unions this. think parts NY, Teachers Unions trying block vaccine mandates. However, Teachers favor it. Depending union represents, good way union leaders get voted out. canada, no, every student “bribe someone” lol totally pro-vaccine going far. one injected anything will, unless special situation. it. 

It's enough prohibit non-vaccinated associating public vaccinated.  life curtailed enough, ""undecided"" get shot. absolutely stubborn stay ghettos. Yikes. 

Video people running lollapalooza break fence; checks done all. ~75% whole population, including children, vaccinated actually chance herd immunity overwhelming hospitals. means less time infectious. since transmission occurs symptom onset, clear good news really is. still infect people know infected, hence masks Basically, gop rolling dumpster fire constantly trying cover asses blaming people bad decisions. I’m Florida, anything possible friend mine telling security responsible checking proof vaccination barely looked cards people showing.

Two different things. long we’re allowed large social gatherings again? Another year half mean guess silver lining? Someone else stating video taken “initial” security checkpoint making sure paper checked validity second checkpoint. still misleading. like number needed treat used retracted paper argue vaccines harmful. long COVID still circulates, percentage *will* increase NNT decreases. true unvaccinated well  Case load doesn’t matter, hospitalization rates, disconnected cases ways never before. let ten times worse try people maybe wise up.

Hmmm. country live in? 12 17 adults. included 70% figure. probably should, there's fields notes whatever, add whether apparently temporary change not. 

Now I'm trying think whether noticed anything last flu shot, stressful time anyway hard tell get vaccine. Thought time honestly. Apparently wrong. I'm cleared definitely go get it. I'm already sick shit. bet 90%+ deaths significant co-morbidities immunosuppressed. That's I've seeing news stories interviews nurses/doctors. Whatever would count it. extend eviction moratorium - unlikely extend unemployment benefits especially bad companies hurting workers.  fuck true, staying house forever then. didn’t say anything people vaccinated…. people fine. Lollapalooza also allowed unvaccinated people long COVID test within 72 hours security wasn’t stringent actually checking test taken  shouldn’t. Vaccine = mask. Anything else implies vaccine doesn’t work. Yep, we've full capacity baseball games country couple months (some even indoors) one says word.

I feel like Lollapalooza hate fun say ""LMAO look people getting COVID see Limp Bizkit!"" one bats eye people packed stadium watch ballgame. beef industry uses significantly water almond industry.  conspiracy certain countries used internet misinform moronic country. seems happening vaccine. Yup, hyperbole parent poster. see close election Media cited study peer-reviewed. know enough virology argue agree this. true, Lambda horrifying.  anecdotal story science. friend sucks.  way weeks, stop getting data 2-3 days, theres data dump worldometers goes back fills case data day People read headlines article see “5 people vaccinated tested positive!!” run hills. I've thought beginning. Using weeks vaccinate bed-bound elderly care facilities seems futile 18-25 year olds partying every weekend.

My vaccination order would follows: first medical care professionals types (including pharmacy, EMT), fire departments police. Second: teachers, daycare, waiters, grocery store employees, politicians, pilots airplane cabin crews. Third: truck drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, non-grocery store employees. Fourth: tertiary education students types, adult professionals cannot work home, active elderly, athletes, unemployed disabled. Fifth: school children (if vaccine safety concerns arise), adult professionals able work home. Sixth: frail elderly mostly stay home elderly care facilities.

(I know I've missed entire swaths people, think gist reasoning deduced.)

Why? ensure critical workers protected first, stop much spread possible fields people contact lots varying people, move around place place living. Then, onto youngsters can't give shit spread inability understand whats stake. onto ordinary people, finally least likely cause super-spreading events.

""But elderly die!"" wont manage prevent spread vaccinating likely pass on. Cut transmission chains total number cases, including elderly at-risk groups, reduced.

But ship sailed.  I’ve climbed plenty fences get fun past. Less gas car. like vaccinated people kill less unvaccinated. Go get shot asshole. going blame fully vaccinated people deciding attend Lollapalooza.

Interestingly, spouse tested negative today. strange disease, Covid.

Thanks finding link, February 2020 PRC used eight different definition ""covid case"" early 2020. think criteria use now. ""Don't like it? work there.""

Their favorite catchphrase drastically backfire them. It’s talking point link -

“If don’t know they’re vaccinated not,” says Dr. Wu, “we still masking social distancing.”

Terrible headline, breakthroughs involving unvaxxed vaxxed interacting. public good nuance (or reading) point messaging. Even hiding bunch cases reporting getting around hospitals filling up. Congrats, required impressive amount stupidity. massive. Immunocomprimised people risk everything. we're going require restrictions COVID logically need require restrictions everything. what?

What vaccinated? vaccinated fault? Good hear. person left nearly identical comment kidding... got second shot April teared vaccine tent.  want sound dull, true vaccinated people still spread virus? requirement stop spread virus exactly?

Didn’t think would somehow freak Reddit out. thoughts exactly. stat going unvaccinated people keep dying. 70% adult population least one dose?

Yeah that’s saw. went fully authoritarian stomped virus closed borders. point arguing though. catch Covid, vaccinated adult, going put commission couple weeks 

It probably put commission couple weeks. expert put together? vaccines still ~80% effective preventing breakthrough infections, breakthrough prerequisite spreading disease.

In addition, vaccinated people clear disease faster contagious smaller amount time.

I provide sources this, don’t believe me.

Experts trying make clear, ever since disasterous misinterpretation CDC guidance last week, unvaccinated driving spread. cardiac history much worse myocarditis (have gone emergency room heart problems before) still got vaccine. Covid much higher likelihood wrecking health vaccine.

I side effects vaccine whatsoever.  think we've learned whole ""or recent negative test"" thing major weak link here. im obviously talking culture dallas texas general. 

dont use commitment service sword get stab others with. youre special unique. worked habitat 3 years, worked shelter 2, worked families crises one, worked abused neglected children another 1 

the culture dallas garbage state well. one month shut beginning Covid (remember, thats sub) essentially went back normal said ""fuck everyone else. im still gonna need brunch need party"" 

thats garbage culture

thats culture responsible virus still getting worse. Shocked stunned. would imagine? understand- immune response trigger this, that’s likely doctor wasn’t concerned. Yeah bought bunch concert tickets year make staying home last year, mostly indoor venues, recently I've worried unvaxxed assholes Delta (or magical new variant manages worse) going ruin it. We'll see. still get vaccine.  Sheesh asking question. Fuck right force take breathalyzer suspicion driving drunk. Fir part aren’t knocking door saying take test see you’re drunk. “anything” always awful beyond belief.

Turns “bless heart” real quick. want out. bad. think loudest anti vaxers.

Its little harder someone whos 400 pounds unhealthy shit like ""I CARE GOES BODY"" vs someone actually seem care overall health (just comes covid, guess) Memba! Yeah thing won’t get delta either whats matter. Ive around dozens people positive last year got tested multiple times always negative, symptoms. Quoting CDC website “In cluster COVID-19 cases, little transmission occurred asymptomatic case-patients”. immune system works guys, relax. Go lose weight opening mouth pandemic. Fuck cases, time people start living lives again! makes happy see crowded festival like again! child going better risking COVID getting homeschooled. COVID present major risk children. homeschooled stunt social growth. Sooo need eat deer saying? actually seen videos people storming in? year like every year fences mean nothing. wasn’t one tik tok showed people storming in. multiple videos plenty news coverage Hopefully masks schools, seems UK ok virus spreading kids. 

On positive note- think we’re seeing life looks like virus becomes endemic due high vaccination rate. expect happen?

They sneaking in. allowed there. allowed stay someone festival see's them. vaccine get? never lifted mask mandate. People walking around vaccinated unvaccinated without masks indoor settings months. CDC needs start communicating target audience, assumption people hear vaccine think “I won’t get this”, example, I’m worried getting polio. real Covid death toll probably already passed 10M. it’s least getting close.  We’re already experiencing am. Nurses burnt exhausted, many leaving nursing together. already nursing shortage Covid, it’s much worse now. ER tons positions open, plus ended almost traveler contracts reason. it’s hospital, every single one city struggling find staff, across pretty much areas. got sick within hour work. Felt fine one minute next achy feverish, warning. 

Good luck friend! Taking one specific doctor's word gospel way people become anti-vax .. love big brother too! Totally book danger crap anything. Well, it’s immediate family, I’ve either conversations them, I’m confident attitude toward vaccination. omen cousin one. Younger people vaccinated, emphasis getting back normal, lack education emphasis ways reduce infection. work Missouri county 25% vaccinated.

Where live much better least low 40s.

In places like unvaccinated filling ICUs capacity heard, spreading midwestern states. *will* email state sent confirming got vaccine. may important (and suggested more) card. agree you. wouldn’t allow them. since are, hope they’re stringent least.  said, verification person vaccination card, could really use copy anybody's.

I went small show required vaccination cards went ID vaccination card expecting check verify person listen vaccination card didn’t. student recently spent entire year attending traveling world access everyone else's file personally verify every worker, student, teacher vaccinated? Really? President literally called hoax longer US not? Also refused wear mask like ever basically ever shut down? Yeah, got put new medicine basically questions. regular appointments there's anything pops long term use, we'll catch it. make sense!

You must new humanity.  hold goddamn festival last hundred years, really.  freedom simple minded people understand. That's really it.

They can't understand long games played restrict actual citizenship rights happy required wear masks indoor social services continue function without overwhelmed. society, give weak vulnerable pretty much every issue, Covid too..

^(I'll see out...) Bro months wrong. 8 7 nowhere NEAR September, 9th month. Florida doesnt count snowbirds tourists case counts. kinda point, states going see delta peaks different times. hearing TX FL now, hear ca NY spikes. Texas already reporting case numbers 7 day average, whereas NY CA still trending up. Yes, double vaccinated still transmit, looks like quite rare / much, much lower rate (preliminary studies show someone became infected vaccinated, around half likely to pass infection others compared infected people weren’t vaccinated). This, coupled estimated low rate breakthrough infections based studies date, means vaccinated unlikely high source transmission.

The vast majority transmission come unvaccinated. driving cases could infect vaccinated.

Just yesterday, Israel (Alpha variant):

""In study 1497 fully vaccinated, total, 2.6% healthcare workers breakthrough COVID-19 infections.

The likely source COVID-19 infection 37 healthcare workers available data unvaccinated person, household member 57% cases. 30% cases, suspected source unvaccinated fellow healthcare worker vaccinated people get infected 78% less likely spread virus household members unvaccinated people. Overall, adds high protection transmission, say folks advocating reasonable measures still followed given country least. Indoor. 3 (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc (TSN.N) said Tuesday mandating COVID-19 vaccinations entire workforce, joining growing list major U.S. companies face renewed pandemic restrictions due fast-spreading Delta variant.

Labor unions meat companies pushing states increase pace vaccine rollout food sector protect workers avoid supply-chain disruptions COVID-19 outbreaks, closures slaughterhouses last year. least favorite flavor Fanta Didn’t AOC something similar? way, kinda thing could good strengthens public trust vaccines, no? lol yea could held piece paper joke Mexico highest childhood obesity rate world.

What the...? medical professionals. Experts. Get sidelines. mayor ffs. CDC's flip flop masks confusing. one thing clear: masks help protect you. Better safe sorry. There’s “could” it. 

On bright side, another 20 years republicans gone won’t new generation voters.

Because went here, caught covid, died. insisted ""our hospitals open business""

So funeral homes. Fortunately, wrong, get confused given media coverage last week. Vaccinated people *who infected* similar Ct values unvaccinated people. vaccine good preventing infections *and* vaccinated people infected clear virus rapidly likely infectious less time.

I'm saying terms social political decisions, valid argument. effects lockdown bad need sacrifice kids unvaxed risk worse vaccine resistant variant? looks like way many countries heading. disagree it, least admit that's side arguing, get mitigation preventing much damage (and again, looking like side win) side wins.

But bullshit ""oh vax personal choice STOP pandemic"" leads dumb shit like Santis BANNING masks schools. Cause people can't admit arguments full re-opening tied ""and get sick, suffer, die believe better"" (which again, valid argument). means nothing without enforcement fines.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Kind confused asking delta (may) still get vaccinated people sick they're also less likely severe symptoms means less likely transmit others. least that's doc observed. illegal Supreme Court already ruled That's goal misinformation! rising one tied large outdoor events

There contract tracing even occur - I'm curious argue that. insinuating cases rising since country started open? economy supports human lives. Wild concept isn’t it? lol 'member. Thanks. Sorry took long look this. anything direct article terms evidence increased transmission? see PCR data viral RNA levels higher Delta, nothing really related level infectious virus. Figure 1D gets close pretty weak evidence. ask Lancet study looked vaccinated health care worker infections recently saw spread vaccinated people, including home, interesting found many PCR positive Ag negative, suggesting could RNA actually infectious virus. thoughts? ordered pack... though seem cheaper options single people need 1. Oh well, expensive anyway. Bottlerock Napa sold Labor Day weekend. Fun times Cali! Yes, cases rising one tied large outdoor events. hysteria impending Covid wave Lollapalooza line events size happening across country daily. would expect see clusters coming KC Royals, TB Rays, Marlins games due states/localities surges. seen anything showing large outdoor events making surges worse even contributing. realize age group less vaccinated SF. Everyone know personally living SF age range hunt vaccines last spring. everyone know SF fully vaccinated. know that's anecdotal still seems bizarre they're lagging behind state average. Actually yes lmao. 

They use computer system (sourced medical company) verify vaccination documentation every student faculty member. Submitting forms pain ass tho.  gym already requires proof vaccination maskless workouts.  I've zero issues menstrual cycle since receiving doses Pfizer vaccine. fact, experienced side effects all. even sore arm. 

However, one employees period since receiving first dose April. pregnant never happened before. Otherwise feels perfectly fine. 

That said, many things fuck period. Weight gain loss, even small amount, exercise, stress, sleep issues, birth control, certain supplements ""herbal medicines"". really hard know. getting downvoted, could see thing college. jacket inadvertently put though washer dryer. end cycle even know vaccination card. things fragile. 

I asked hospital send another one, got waterproof vaccine card holders Amazon keep passport now. Within 2 weeks second dose began getting period every 3 weeks dot. Weirdest thing I’ve ever experienced regards reproductive system. Usually I’m right schedule. I’m 4 mo front second dose. actually agree certain activities voided, necessary groceries pharmacy.

Going watch movie? Show vaccine.

Going restaurant indoors? Paper please people much closer together think people hoping solid 80% vaccination rate. far, US well terms vaccination well regards many vaccines availability. It’s hard create actual validated thing even within different states US, let alone considering NYC receives tourists world (and vaccinated countries). good news lots people don’t feel comfortable don’t wanna go hassle faking card Yeah. Biden made statement that. reached yesterday!

It’s like UK 90% adults least one dose anything…

Oh wait..  voter registration number sufficient? Holy crap exactly need ""experts"" warn us this? Even idiot tell going happen. Can't use microchips check?

/s alternative people make risk assessment realize vaccinated means go back living life without worrying vaccination status others. ""he cited statistic Denmark somewhere"" 

what nonsense. citing study foreign country would apply united states america

It's little disingenuous ignore difference delta makes. Children acting vectors much last year. part makes difficult argue people districts. kids spread last year keep enough understand different ballgame now. worked school last year number &lt;10 year olds caught covid grew exponentially April, May case numbers dropping everyone else much contagious UK variant younger children. (Estimate 3 4 cases elementary school spring despite high community spread, 10 unrelated cases last couple months school year) time update; support government telling private businesses engage commerce with? lmao, fucking statist. hell people last 16 months finally fear?

Here theory.

When vaccinations initially started US, people considering taking vaccine turn comes, time infections going down, maybe people felt important take vaccine.

But wind changed. new wave started, driven new, infectious variant. caused psychological shock effect unvaccinated: felt like left cold vaccinated safely inside warm compartment.

So could kind ""inb4"" effect. 🙂 second realized scale realized gonna last least years. Still sucks. referencing one single incident ~450 cases.

What Massachusetts like 60% infections vaccinated people.

That remotely true. Literally cares. sit next woman whose son husband went. Oof!  mean led bunch unmasked dipsticks transit, worries way people outside. Usually ride transit here, people masked weekend. Anyway, need get covid test I’m sick af (and yeah vaccinated) Toronto, Canada here. hospitalizations, ICU deaths still trending downward. Please spread misinformation. also vaxxed country G7 plays it.  sure. kids go nap I’ll reading! find anything concrete I’ll surely get back you.  Voter ID special new ID, means requiring ID vote, driver’s license would count as, it’s people official government ID whatsoever (who also won’t able eat indoors prove name vaxx card you) can't tell sarcasm not... Especially line statue liberty lol. No, need say ""Well vaccine available. choose take it, get participate public life employer may choose fire you."" that, FDA needs list vaccines officially approved, emergency approved. gross. Mandates walk fine line dictatorships. None permanent, except typically vaccines required (schools, hospitals, etc). right middle war virus soon take least another year vaccinate enough world. pandemic ends restrictions remain, time raise hell. say ""full capacity cubs games"" many people talking? get lot hate fan base strong believe UK opened vaxxed US far know people going UK US still subjected travel ban tho kids die yes it’s going high number certainly much less many causes childhood mortality we’ve never shut society for. whole notion one death many bullshit. zero risk society kids large going drastically hurt catching covid. consequences years covid precautions worse consequences small slice children drastically hurt covid. January 2020 hell? seems like lot deer 2021 40%? hell going on? source that? trying snarky, family waiting confirmation spread rates vaccinated people. found yet.  would rather 5,000 cases amongst 20-year-olds 500 cases among seniors.”

Until becomes 5,000 cases among seniors.... Well would I’m vaccinated. national sport card convention noooooo masks distancing inside … joke CDC PowerPoint said 75% efficacy protection infection. So, means penitration could cause types outcomes least floor. That's complete answer, gives something make decisions based of.

Anecdotally, therefore rest less value, encountered sone studies indicate poor outcomes correlated hospitalization, universally caused hospitalization. say, hospitalized makes worse likely, impacts happen still population exhibit symptoms. (CDC PowerPoint, put symptomatic infection around 87%; gb intelligence study implied neurological effects we're correlated with, caused by, hospitalizations)  always drives nuts. county reopened maskless months. Restaurants packed. Airplanes packed. events drop bucket compared people living daily lives. might want look definition majority posting misinformation I've read seems like countless News stories serious infections occurring weddings parties

Not fun either. Nothing fun this. Hope it’s last. Could? could. Definitely will. Brave tsunami way things going, may change Right I'd like thank jerks made vax card slightly large fit standard sized wallet slot Also cascade another virus loves kinds events: herpes still got shot, 58% year gone by! many moons ago.. villages used provide everything needed one another survive

tribal living is/was thing think 70% baseline goal Biden, anything concretely scientific. think, realistically, delta, probably needs mid high 80s minimum. don’t think care  thats get variants think data Monday’s often low many states backfilled coming days. wouldn’t get excited saw continuation trend past Wednesday. unfortunately forced vaccinations leper colonies way forward. Even kids vaxxed, possible variants form diseased unvaccinated shitheads vaccine might protect from. Yeah, wear mask actively eating third option: people want wear mask wear them.

Vaccinated people well protected anyways, unless immuno-compromised. are, PPE wear going close extended contact known suspected unvaccinated people. protects virtually 100 percent used correctly.

And unvaccinated want unmasked, business far concerned. Unwise, sex without condom, lost wink sleep worrying people that. I’m sorry thought sort agreed using poor countries landfills bad people USED form communities/villages help provide stuff.. without business man taking cut  travel in, out. business, obviously.  hateful creature, proof vaccination verified? Yeah, frustrating. booked things looked great, went bad figured nyc pretty well. 

I'll call couple weeks. I’ve waiting this. It’s way friend get vaccination, it’s required. work Microsoft. No, course not, understand vaccinated still vector transmission. transmissions ....you get it.... mutations. people feel Movie Theaters right now? states mask mandates again. go theater keep mask entire time, except eat popcorn/drink, masked off?

I'm fully vaccinated hesitant indoors 2 hours bunch people. Florida Man #1! think starved anyone - local officials delivered groceries affected areas door door. practice welding doors shut desperation inhumane, spread misinformation.  would assume exception eligible shot. case would actually safer given can’t get shot. Hopefully eligible soon Yeah, main point. one says word? already midst delta outbreak Lolla. self isolating due cold? fine people, people could get hospitalized (Not mention there's vaccine it). science say breakthrough cases long sick? big deal wear mask practice basic common sense comes social distancing.  children younger 12 brainer. Call national guard worry constitutional legitimacy move later. number one reason can’t stand wait till kids vaccinated. 12-16 eligible vaccine uptake incredibly low. never admit he's wrong, never hear apology him. Apologizing show weakness them, rather burn place ground admit wrong. worked fest bev ops. Everyone required fully vaccinated, staff fans. Lets see plays out. Peak cases 1/10 deaths.

*""86% 65 received first dose 74% second dose COVID-19 vaccine""* Yep mention masks can’t mandated it’s individuals would surprised see, general, theaters fall. 
I imagine they're going streamline bit, much like would assume companies will, confirmed saved ""Stubs"" profile something like (AMC program). Honestly, expressed feel governor, I'd banned reddit ole Ronnie would storm house arrested. He's good that's good at. Even fake tan shitty. I'm waiting go orange ass kisses.  heard checking joke. Basically hold piece paper phone would let without really checking. Also reports people sneaking holes gates rushing security area.

In case, even everything done well, expect called super spreader event next weeks. Delta beast. Thanks response. 

Thought might covered health insurance, wondered without.

Controversial, without vaccine penalised unforgivable impact US health service there’s free assistance available. 

Surely insurers looking pushing anti-vaccine movement too? bring axe case hack stage. Bury axe advance different location. Maybe also second axe ensure reach first axe. Source deadlier? Also, went Miami 80k people 3 day concert top eachother. group vaccinated, none us tested positive. risk willing take 2 years vacations. fact none us got goes show may little paranoid delta variant getting vaccine. contagious say would think least someone knew would gotten trip.  death rate matters now, infection rate since countries reaching high enough supply vaccinate everyone wants it. DeSantis also opened bunch vaccination sites near Villages. People parts state trouble getting early old Republican voters got quickly (if wanted it). It’s hot AF places, spend lot time inside windows sealed shut AC high. Makes much easier transmission zero distancing, capacity, mask requirements.  removed office. Laws policy made using *any* religious views. **Period**. Separation church state.  Economy human lives. economy means food, water, power, heating, air conditioning. People work grow food, people work bring food market, people work sell food consumers, people work able afford purchase food. economy allows people live comfort.

But wish, could kill 2/3rds country everyone could work 12 hours day farm make enough food survive want return that. racist towards specifically though? Genuine question. NOTHING mask requirements hurts economy. NOTHING. hurt ANYONE require mask. couch sick move 10 days days kid tired cold like three still experienci.g fatigue taste/smell, mom still hospitalized, dad symptoms. vaccinated. Like everything else, Florida dragging US down. now? huge drop cases everything opened UK couple weeks ago - imply causation? That's really relevant issue hand. issue US main strategy AZ hoard several tens millions doses plan use months, alpha delta killing tons.

Sure, eventually US stepped vaccine exports. considering AZ shelf life months, guess many several tens millions doses ended expired due US strategy letting massive amounts doses collect dust shelf life.  “NOW KNOW LOVING SHIT RIGHT HERE”  comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Welcome back, fellas! vaccine really hard get?  isn’t. Okay, I'll bite.....how?

Are excluded getting free vaccines? show pharmacy, you’ll leave shot arm. think lot people got banned Twitter Facebook past year Reddit, now. forgot exact term is, definitely racist current definition racism. share vaccinations received Black people also continues smaller share deaths states, although states similar share deaths. share vaccinations received Hispanic people similar higher share deaths reporting states, although states continues lower. example, California, 30% vaccinations gone Hispanic people, account 63% cases, 48% deaths, 40% total population state. Similarly, District Columbia, Black people received 43% vaccinations, make 56% cases, 71% deaths, 46% total population.

Edit: Oh, disparate impact term looking think. No. Getting worse. die point, guess though.

Unless find treatment. unlikely. fact outdoors certainly help, fact part people attending vaccinated/tested. multiple events press live lead super-spreading, entry requirements, either forged (show screenshot someone elses vaccination/test) simply checked.

The question much cases event lead to, care. think vaccination %-ages need quite bit higher care given delta thing. apologies needed. think people agenda people trying share information provides complete accurate picture. justified assumption.

I apologize came aggressively. still know many people died original outbreak (unless trust official numbers, don't).

Any particular reason? According latest data, July 24th… it’s true whatever including hear Delta *kills* live! yet. follow CDC guidelines, 3rd shots/boosters recommended time. flu also booster shots every year, act crazy

once month shot big deal Sorry. Didn’t mean sound snarky. I’m used many idiots screaming freedom told wear mask. 

That sounds like good system actually. That's loser's bet. \*Of course\* got vaccinated... dog fight far goes. last reports I'd seen lot far-right news reports china time proven wrong (showing ""lines people hospitals"" actually lines people something else, etc) heard specifically anyone address crematoria information going around. 

I'm perfectly fine assuming stories back BS though, wondering anyone actually fact checked line line disprove Vaccines free, licenses cost quite bit wait potentially hours DMV poor work likely can’t it. Make IDs free automatically given people I’d OK voting ID. well start new variant overtakes world hope one turns coronavirus common cold. (i'm vaxxed maybe catch anyway mutate good way!) 

*oh fooling...* thumb states, CDC provides really nice visuals make obvious: 

Here 7 day case rate per 100K people, clearly shows bad FL  amount loopholes vaccine passport program ridiculous. There's way effective hold long.

Vegans religious groups refuse vaccination ethical beliefs regarding animal testing, descisions protected entirely international human rights laws, meaning there's way government force vaccinated exclude society beliefs unless violate rights.

How regulate someone's vegan religious? can't. nutty anti-vaxxers claim vegan nobody say otherwise violation human rights.

All vaccination passports ridiculous amount wasted money idea gets dropped realise nothing ineffective. Many us already reached point. always say this. Fear porn scare masses. Stay safe, keep healthy ignore fear tactics this. Together stand strong get trying times. reason judgmental unvaccinated point? conditions keep vaccinated? people simply safe wear masks get vaccine virus killed 4 million people year crazy ones? Righhhtttttttt

This absolutely nothing ""msm"" whatever lunatics rant 24/7... common sense. sure works every place, company takes steps bill without insurance. Typically need form ID, go different system get override order process it. I’ve gotten like 5 extra seconds since could probably eyes closed, see others could get flustered it.   completely agree! applaud NY California QR Code programs, need federal one. Cause make leisure travel pain, but, also make business travel pain too. Cool analysis. USA vs China comparison many die concentration camps every year.  hear saying, also deal psychological effects deal crap repeatedly year. people wore masks back started COVID really, really scary. People dying, hospitals effective treatments... lot simply unknown, every new COVID-related symptom renewed fear. 

That's longer case. vaccine assuring people they're going get ***terribly*** sick, almost certainly ***won't die*** ***suffer organ damage*** catching it, less scary. even without vaccine, there's 1% death rate, people's general belief healthiness. ""So bother wearing mask? like there'll consequences! me, is."" fear factor gone. 

I live Missouri. We're sitting around 40% vaccinated. see maybe 10% wearing masks grocery store days. mask mandate would absolutely need enforced live, one issued. Oooo, remember Dakotas got hammered last Fall? Let’s again! funny vaccinated since vaccine work still wear mask afraid getting covid even though vaccine supposed protecting covid. Isnt amazing? 40% around 150 sampled deer throughout country COVID though, appears common way deers exposed COVID.  
Simplest answer probably they're spreading COVID amongst themselves. Funny certain mass gatherings super spreaders. like want plants shutdown, bad press.

They grind workers fast meat byproducts. surprised announces candidacy president 2024. would incredibly easy go say one outdoor pop sites give J&amp;J concert simply say don’t insurance haven’t shot. giving anyone outside baseball game quick signed form drivers license number. No. state. oh okay. lab figure send every sample labs Florida’s vax percentage 50%. Half 21 million leaves ten million unvaccinated potential Delta patients.

Decently vaccinated Delta would 85% greater. boosters already? lead believe ready yet. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

""Of people get vaccinated end breakthrough infection, risk coming back clinic long Covid manifestation very, small,"" Al-Aly country why? need worry worker shortage customers stop going buying products. shit. want imply know anything motivations US. actually assume government selfish giving away think get international clout giving away using themselves. Well fair, recently insane spike incidence UK. Might connected EUROs, would fit timeframe.

In districts incidence went 1000.

Had look around 2 weeks ago since need another UK trip damn, [what going god cases coming would've real challenge. Oh yeah, didn’t think hotel requirements. Also everybody events eat, two three times day they’re restaurant. protests you’d go back home eat restaurants closed. Completely different dynamic. 

We got tested pretty often too. don’t even know get tested now. lot places NY along (I live upstate town maybe half restaurants bars check vaccine status indoor customers). It’s extremely easy — download pass app verifies vaccine status. gives QR code. There’s separate app download uses phone’s camera check QR codes presented customers. takes five seconds set use. pro-Covid states won’t set something like I’ll bet NYC sees high compliance, hope spreads rest state. thing that’s place policies ineligible children vaccinated adults. Cars example risky activity, normalized accepted society, regardless deaths injury causes, provides important benefits society function. lives matter seems reasoning harsh treatment restrictions pandemic acting society rest activities risky every day life cause hundreds thousands deaths every year? race? Waiting Lollapalooza variant festival attendees required show proof vaccination/negative test like lolla? comparable Where's conflict? good thing interests workers aligned corporate bottom line. need private sector intervention given failure government protect workers. like Tyson, buy food. Big Kovid's Table like big science experiment. I'll following aftermath. maybe bad worst predictions, usually isn't. i'm gonna watching hospital admissions, deaths, vaccine stats &amp; ages next weeks. oh yeh

&amp;#x200B;

its super spreader event Well, absolute disaster. I'm glad kids ok kids outliers. several studies point direction. Remote learning awful even worse Biden said need masks anymore. Yeah course rural IL practically different state.  I'm sure write; I'm homeless BC. baseline comparison pretty good begin with. definitely envy people US Europe hundreds thousands dying, living relatively normal distanced life.  Good thanks answering.

I want us healthy well I’m sorry assuming didn’t intention. make majority hospitalized cases deaths sucks treating people like numbers, it’s fact. Like smoker lung transplant list. Priority go actually care health. That's far display strength leadership . 


Leadership analyzing adjusting making sure adjustments keep people depend leadership safe .  


This sticking fingers ears going ""NANANNANANA can't see Covid icky liberal media stooges , \*sticks tongue\*"" communities lives supporters ravaged.  


Desantis ensured last summer people end grandparents, children, parents, siblings, man written death warrant people Florida cool survivors get vote he's sacrificed family members . thanks. India quite ok terms vaccination actually. variants might still emerge herd stupidity here. can’t win sensible people, cling anti-vax/conspiracy people rest career.

Because win anti-vaccine people pushing vaccines seniors hard wearing masks. DeSantis encourages vaccinations — said “vaccines saving lives” — facing backlash anti-vaccination wing political base. chance vaccinated person dying Covid less struck lighting. actually apartment doors, secondary exits residential buildings, forcing people go checkpoint Colorado one too. It’s called myColorado. big question. lower vaccination rate lack government response may lead different outcome. strange waves seem follow different patterns. Apart strict lockdowns (and vaccines), seem control course pandemic. Based what? B/c that's happened occur UK? CA also system get digital proof vaccination. seen anyone ask proof use digital proof yet though. aren’t different vaccinated. flash cell phone turned went gate one actually checking vaccination cards.

Lol experience all. there? checked cards dates pretty thoroughly. I'd argue spent time looking vaccination cards bags security check. much better job expected. Apple too, they've always great marketing PR team. people capitalist brain, would rich course! She’s getting second shot tomorrow. vaccines wearing according studies Isreal, vaccinated spread virus much invaccinated making herd immunity impossible, get used wearing masks everywhere go thats certainly saying. 

i'll even quote earlier 

""dallas much worse Reynosa.""

""dallas makes Mogadishu look like Vegas"" 

""dallas LITERALLY worst place earth. im talking culture dallas/the culture texas...im saying dallas LITERALLY worst place could ever imagine existing universe time line."" make sure gets vaccine she’s inn states. They’re handing like donuts Yeah fucking shit dude, anyone half fucking brain could see that. Fucking tired garbage ass articles. “Experts warn going outside may increase risk coronavirus exposure!” fucking garbage. need put little tag license items frozen, later consumption.

...people actually freeze taco bell? Lol compared US Europe.

In Quebec, instituted curfew scant evidence slow spread all. seems like crowds everyone errands shorter time windows, digress.

Then restricted care homeless homeless shelters.

They asked “what exceptions curfew homeless given shelters aren’t allowed operate normal? (Remember Quebec winter streets get 20 night)” answer would mercy homeless people might pretend homeless break curfew. homeless man tried get shelter. Couldn’t get covid rules. Went portable construction toilet avoid police. Froze death. Still government refused show mercy homeless. Covid mattered more. curfew lasted winter.

Ya, pretty brutal senseless. don’t understand concept protecting homeless covid denying access basic needs life. never vulnerable, like homeless congregate care facilities. story people denied basic human care slow spread covid pretty brutal well. Sad story. family worked one. Maybe it’s government’s job protect dumb anti-vaxxers there’s safe effective vaccine. almost week late first jab (I’m usually like clockwork). second jab three weeks ago I’m due 4 days, I’ll see happens. Expecting late again. LOL I'm Florida, company tried enforce anything related to, know, trying stop Covid would governor riding giant alligator leading brigades holding flags saying ""freedom government tyranny"" (while employing government tyranny employers, schools counties submit will).

When FDA approves, shall see. then, I'm glad I'm work-from-home. Making plans finally leave state last (once youngest done high school). family realty business trivial decision. likely understatement. thread saying 400 children died covid US since pandemic. includes 12-17 age group vaccinated. 0-11 even less likely die 12-17. Children 12 likely struck lightening die die covid. Covid worth worrying kids No, CDC said all. people make shit go? I've seen estimates mere seconds consider number virus particles compared 15 minutes 2m original strain isolated Wuhan.

Alpha 1000x viral load compared original delta 1000x viral load compared alpha. medically can't get vaccine

There none. Currently neither CDC FDA recognizes medical condition preventing vaccination. Immunocompromised individuals may see reduced efficacy, still recommended get shots. 

The *only* thing prevent vaccination history severe allergic reaction vaccine's ingredients. given that: 

1) mRNA JnJ vaccines share ingredients (aside sodium chloride)

2) likelihood severe allergic reaction vaccine ingredient roughly 1 760,000

That means likelihood someone able take mRNA vaccine *or* JnJ 1 577 **billion**. Or, stated another way, actually statistically likely single person Earth cannot get least one currently-available vaccines. Pfizer/Moderna need get booster shots Delta end year. id rather rest go die instead.

Then waiting long long time inside 

Myself vaccinated friends enjoying massive events summer long sign dont worry stepping dog shit walking work

Try cleaning house  70% blacks banned eating inside NYC restaurants. Epic totally agree needed stem tsunami covidiots flooding hospitals. People understand modern medical system basically like Time manufacturing, careful balance patients, bed space &amp; practitioners. past 15 yrs we've eliminated much slack medical system, there's cushion kind ""surge"". covid killing kids, media would go rampant man.

Its happening. Rare case, widely reported nothing huge.   words... benefits grandparents fought WWII, like freedom, wealth, technological progress, improved personal rights, safety security... toss benefits created wealthiest progressive technologically advanced society human history. 

When Amish start using internet? far…So good…So what. (Second album). pretty good too.  spare couple thousand dollars lying around, sure /s

but yeah, antibody based medicine pretty expensive produce, especially quantities need inject per treatment COVID (based numbers used trump). This, transmission means increasing odds mutation. circulate rapidity unbalanced vaccinated population increases odds evading vaccines 15 minutes Alpha. Delta shown infect people mere seconds exposure. me, 100% worth it.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Good point! completely forgot that. Thanks, we’ll that.  bad, honestly Disney World crowded weeks. cat already bag. Desantis total fuck face. Ah. Fair point. indoor graduation party 70 people end June, everyone 12 confirmed vaccinated. Nobody got Covid. Delta airlines fiscally sponsored covid though, definitely read Reddit full people living parents basement never social life. lock again, probably why.  think changes, criteria categories still similar. know latest definitions are, difficult find, look. thing clear don’t understand vaccines work. Everytime see news bs mfer spouts think stupid fucking hat stepdad wears. ""Make America Florida- DeSantis 2024"" 

Yes thing exists yes wanna put head fucking wall. one want small businesses go out, leaving us big corporate chains little competition.


Some larger corporations raising pay though.

Amazon, BestBuy, Target $15 hour. others well. several $10 while. Even places like Walmart. saying $10 good, better $7.25. 


Small businesses raise pay get better employee, knowledge experience. guy invested funeral services companies dickhead??  assume viral load correlates hard hit virus. although delta 1000 times viral load making traditional measures less effective ever reduce invasive counts welcome [**the evidence clear: **The problem unvaccinated population**. people got vaccines, current surge wouldn’t big; certainly wouldn’t lead levels hospitalization death seen across US. true months ago, remains true people still make vast majority cases, hospitalizations, deaths. **They’ve made 94 percent reported Covid-19 cases states available data**, [**report last week Kaiser Family found. They’ve also made similar, higher, shares hospitalizations deaths.  likely serious case already exposed get again. recent study found people infected year ago, half sterilizing antibodies Delta. may greatly protected catching it, depending it. Vaccination boost immunity lot. easily find protestors wanted make point. 

But personally would prefer trust studies science released says outdoor gatherings fairly safe, people unrelated event would mitigate (which smart enough actually read study's abstract minimum would see mitigation done people connected events, lowering overall spread), people 16-35 age bracket unlikely serious case COVID, vaccinated people unlikely issues COVID even delta variant. Got it, thanks! burden proof prove infectious? due under-reporting weekend, Georgia reported 9400+ COVID cases today - highest figure since January 15th. 

Hospitalizations 2.6K total, 500 behind last summer's peak rising rapidly. troubling, ways go exceeding January peak 5.7K patients. However, many hospitals southern part state lowest vaccination rate reaching capacity overflow hospitals. 

Georgia 7th least ""fully vaccinated"" state, ahead Alabama, Mississippi, Arkansas, Wyoming, Louisiana, Idaho. Noting: 

""Also, recent report ) evaluating previous SARS-CoV-2 infections found memory B cells produce new antibodies recognize new variants mutations upon exposure pathogen.""

Little surprise given CDC also states,

""Breakthrough infections may boost immunity; four weeks outbreak long-term care facility, fully vaccinated residents experienced breakthrough infections found significantly higher antibody levels vaccinated individuals experience breakthrough infections."" -  certain extent, like US mask wearing varies region. local area 90% masked indoors, hear big cities less ditched them. worth supermarket, shop restaurant chains ask mask still.

As lockdown, actually locked since March. majority rest restrictions lifted May, 'Freedom Day' opened nightclubs dropped mask mandate England. CDC stopped recording breakthrough cases? much tunnel vision comes delta. People fail see bigger picture. Much health care infrastructure dedicated treating COVID stressed. point pressure makes collapse. 

You choose live life insulate society consequences. 

We've fucked around plenty people think we've found enough. lessons even started yet.  knew going for. want pretend racist, accuse others racism, think you’re clever making voter ID racist. race bating assholes damn predictable. unlikely U.K. reached herd immunity 58 percent population fully vaccinated.

The US [49.7% fully today.

I think extra 8% vaccinated somehow going mean UK vastly different place US.

If fact big difference, probably due something else. quirk. Ok, good know, thx! Florida's given DeSantis.  researchers like Emory University’s Jennie Lavine turned models try project SARS-CoV-2 might transition pandemic pathogen endemic. paper published Science, Lavine co-authors predicted transition might take anywhere years decades, depending quickly pathogen spreads widely vaccines adopted.

I suggest reading article commenting. one saying lockdown decades. one saying stay home decades. None shit even happened once. people refuse get vaccinated, shit continue go on. Accept denial like article said. That's still pretty good. think elementary school aged children, they're often adults. they're vaccinated, little chance contracting spreading covid. 

It would nice FDA approved already. anyone really think FDA going all, ""We can't approve these, safe thought."" Would anyone ever trust FDA half country got vaccinated? would political nightmare. FDA remain apolitical, I'm sure they're well aware blowback would cause. also moot point. vaccines safe. approved. poltiics, science there. They’ve saying along. Also, hear lot of: “if it’s time meet Lord…” Thx, gotcha, check place out. Sure motor vehicle accidents leading cause death children, horrible, doesn’t mean don’t need pay attention causes death you’re vaccinated, care? You’re protected. everyone else could society got shot like did. can’t convince to. I’m gonna twiddle thumbs waiting forever change minds nothing convince them. 

Masks useless unless you’re wearing good mask. people wearing useless masks.  two us, yes.

But feel bad. may one thinks *Rust Peace* best album. Man, I'm hoping do. concert supposed go last summer rescheduled fall, want get postponed 😬 lifetime covid, inevitably endemic disease. another year two pandemic level spread though - we're far running people neither vaccinated previously infected. went festivals late 90s manually checked every single ticket lines really take long. want spend money it, done quite quick. Yes assuming unvaccinated currently infectious, inherently wrong Love it. Hope makes way south LA SD. Gonna make law hefty fine people gonna keep stupid shit wish Republicans would quit trying make us part Jonestown experience. agree completely, heard never wear mask Sturgis. really want people too. article accurate, restricrions, Delta prominent variant, cases dropping, hospitalisations lowest since start. now, lets hope stays way flu season 2 months time, thats question mark me. Nearly every pharmacy LA walk vaccinations. guy claiming requiring proof vaccination RaCiSt ridiculous. Shill. next election. can’t believe put damn concert believe they’re referring Lamda. (The variant Brazil.) Anyone know good website use refute antivaxxer talking points Covid vaccines? 800k includes first second doses. We'd probably need least two months rate, would 80% adults, total population. year half.

But article talking many years left, possibly decades. That's hyperbole, literally words expert. 

To absolutely honest, familiar restrictions US. However, Canadian province imposed extremely strict lockdown, along curfew, experience restrictions hard live with, i'm sure survive another winter curfew. 53-year-old pain therapist Marble Falls, town 6,000 people Burnet County, **he said wants see vaccines get full approval — rather current emergency authorization — Food Drug Administration gets one. even then, Offutt said chances slim** since “doesn’t feel threatened COVID personally.”




Typical, BS argument.


Full approval dosent matter antiVa, excuse need move goalposts. UK wide open since June. idiotic argument. Hospitals free overflowing overrun, duh. death. Good read. virus strain variant possesses unique stable phenotypic characteristics. 

Each VOC unique stable phenotypic characteristics ascertained results experiments done laboratory, cells culture animals, coupled observations made infected humans.

Most observed lab experiments (e.g. 

I confused author would consider different strains meet exact definition.  we’re talking virus permanently human population continue evolve methods around immune systems within population order continue spread. able decrease virulence (but infectivity) ever updated vaccines mirror dangerous mutations virus. feel like general public doesn’t know that’s state affairs. year’s vaccine isn’t last one you’ll get disease. MANY come…for foreseeable future. fail keep date shots exposed potentially *highly* virulent **super-charged** infectious virus. hate say this, many definitely double down. governors Florida Texas won’t face repurcussions flouting safety precautions. fact, might rewarded politically. feel like people read textbooks going like “wtf going on?!” Holy shit don’t care anymore, let people live lives wish could lose home go back work September. scary knowing kids exposed Sure seems like entering Canada fact Canadians Thinking children, hot right now. 

Jk, many people forget 50 million people still can’t get vaccine. 70% adults. Around 57% total population UK restrictions cases havent gone up, they've gone down. Take article pinch salt Hard make zombiefied already Discovered 8-9 months ago iirc one likes Cryptic Writings? ticket checking scanning wristband across kiosk lights green you’re good go in. 

Now, think done vaccine negative test proof upload app portal checked approved, probably didn’t want spend money couldn’t figure day quickly enough. 

And yes, you’re right could matched every persons ID test vax card, would made lines last hours day. guess shouldn’t say impossible, impossible way set also avoiding lines lasting 3+ hours. repost. Great news uses UK data runs May 16th PCR data. 

The UK vaccinate many people Pfizer second doses April, protection antibody ""peak"" occurs right vaccination. interesting see efficacy maintained active neutralizing antibodies fade. Quite. Really struggling see relevance OP. Don’t Fauci Florida. getting people's faces? Seems little weird. Stay away me.  Delta Florida instead! Nobody tell Tucker. imagine number parents protested would taken kids public schools, ultimately hurting district's funding.

Either way, I've saying schools closing weeks opening regardless mask mandates. Closures limited Florida. That's also bullshit.

The US hit 70% 1 shot 12 older. going massive community spread.

My community 84%+ even Delta here. 

Fuck unvaccinated. odds infinitesimal breakthrough case hospitalization, let alone death. even remotely said. epidemiologist said may take coronavirus decades shift endemic virus depending fast spreads many people get vaccinated. MAMMA? DAD. get reddit?  IIRC didn’t apply EUA encouraged go full FDA approval, hence lack info/use still wear masks businesses, small thing. I'm general though. Tired everything right shit hit wall anyways due anti-vax garbage. hesitant , post made take vaccine appointment lmao anomaly doesn’t suck 46% vote second term election. 

He’s symptom American problem far over. probably right EUA, lot companies going hesitant pull trigger counter lawsuits might produce ""it's fully FDA approved"" Yeah, stopped breathing 10 minutes, humanity would die worry anything anymore. absurd hypotheticals want pointlessly throw around?

The fact is, ship sailed deal we're facing now, waste effort re-litigating might been. know could get practically every pharmacy, grocery, big box store across country.



Is new law something? Well, that's thing - want keep wearing mask til day die. meantime, wear it, accept blip inconvenience, eventually wear it.

But response makes sense care. We'll probably end mask mandates til day die this.

You see want thing - want damn thing face. MS allowing employees permanently switch home office, completely nullifying observation. Vaccinated people spreading variants un-vaccinated. read article do. frustrating read comments people didn't. Death shitty metric kids specifically. 40.2% total pop first dose least 29.8% 2 doses bad Yes Vaccinated friends got really sick last week. 35% vaxxed ones ending hospital mainly. 8% hospitalized vaccinated   immune vaccinated? several studies show lasting immune responses prior infection … included many?  mental health clearly major issue. seems pretty obvious...   Good question--we know years vaccine development (more 100 years, actually!) see potential side effects occur soon vaccination. potential side effects result immune response happens soon vaccination, see new effects many years months later. vaccine ""active ingredient"" speak enters body, immune system recognizes learns (just happens throughout dailiy course life) active ingredient broken gone. wife saw Dave Chappelle Foxwoods CT last month. COVID testing masking required, made abundantly clear bought tickets. rapid testing set one parking garages. Sometime day show went there, got tested, picked Chappelle-branded face mask, test came back negative put wristband you. show let anybody without wristband &amp; face mask. 

So every venue ""don't give shit"" attitude. Granted, Foxwoods hold anywhere near 100K expected Lollapalooza... Meanwhile entering another wave thanks bullshit  data would like many people worldwide vaccinated, many serious effects death post vaccine, chances dying long term effects covid, many caught covid worldwide, i.e, chances catching covid. vaccinated frustrated aren't, since work covid patients hospital, I'd like stats make clear safe vaccine dangerous covid be. best could find possible 2 billion world wide vaccinated (since 4 billion vaccine doses delivered), largest number reactions I've found 45,000, that's reactions, including headaches feeling tired. saw stat said risk long term problems covid could high 18%. wish government agency tracking this, data could there. 0.0000225% chance vaccine reaction, 18% chance long term problems covid, getting vaccine would completely logical. see cold data like that, would helpful.   Naw double get even dumber. really like medics, done deserve it? think hilarious/sad 10% people unvaccinated, blame unvaccinated. 

These people realize vaccine stops covid still wont get it. people alone would help us get close 80% eligible vaccination rate Me? can’t ever tell lines reply go to. mean me, I’m sorry everything awful I’m glad aren’t alone. find types activities averted BLM protests potentially riskier disease spread outdoor civil rights protests: restaurant bar-going retail shopping. risk-avoiding responses protests, coupled mask-wearing protesters, explain BLM protests reignite community-level COVID-19 growth.

You left plenty context. health insurance add waiver: costs incurred covid without vaccination isn’t covered. Problem solved anyone seen study answering question whether ""asymptomatic vanilla-covid"" getting Delta?

Falsity: Freedom isn’t protected constitution. (That whole “life, liberty, pursuit happiness” line still hits like mf.)

1.) even old enough vote?

2.) Please don’t. relevant comes free vaccination?

Because impacts everyone equally. Every single person travel vaccination site. Every single person plan childcare transportation methods / cost. race-specific problem. vaccination sites country excuse ""there sites near me"" work. Chill, vegans eat outside. think part new CDC recommendations masks allowed people keep mouths shut ""vaccinated people resume normal activities"" period scolds again. they're back full force criticizing every activity large group people again, music festivals. point everyone appreciable risk already option vaccinating point people allowed make decisions risk tolerance. brainer. saw someone TikTok went Lolla Chicago river boat tour. also might helpful can't make vaccination mandatory period?

People always come ""slippery slope"" BS frankly tired lives, money time wasted away vaccination skeptics.

Like imagine human suffering moment past future months put one scale put mass vaccinations tell one heavier. Here's thing, need survive there's huge problem pandemic. long continue actively contribute exacerbate problem unvaccinated, think able get help.

I get point perfectly valid point. believe helping people actively hurting rest us. Whats funny unvaxxed group, saying care about, perfectly fine statement. vaccinated group, safe, freak out.

Vaccination works. idea long natural antibodies (from actually getting Covid) lasts. There's suspicion people natural antibodies re-infected Delta pretty easily. jury still out, possibility.

Something lot non-Americans realize domestically, US acts like EU unified country. federal government presents unified face externally, day-to-day governance (everything education law enforcement professional licensure) largely done state governments broad guidelines set federal government.

And problem 50 governments free movement different standards. states, like New York, digital certificate.

He’d go full West World. “It doesn’t look like anything me.” Shocking development. Thank God experts there. never would assumed this. I’d say amazed happening many died last year… I’m sadly not. Good thing got best experts it, observing it, making commentary like wildlife doc series. /j ""1800 kids died another disease, therefore take precautions one""

And think logic flawed one? [Climbing since beginning July easily tbh DeSantis among might throw hat arena shot president 2024. likely want death mismanagement record pretends real save face. knows low information fox fed population believe it. forget got elected first place much loves Trump Trump's message covid. That's fair assessment. seems Delta cause vaccinated people become equally infectious unvaccinated, shorter duration. So, overall less infectious, taking account factors, bode well herd immunity, experts putting upper bound 88% entire population. That's going tough climb. Unbelievable aye? smartest species planet sure fucking stupid sometimes. shit! Can’t work don’t vaccine. like choice that. Thanks. appreciate thoughtful reply. true however fallout taking toll hospitals workforces spreads it’s thing population unable unwilling get vaccinated. us vaccinated folk still role play safeguarding communities interests. tiring given shitheads refuse act responsibly dragging on, hope can. That’s gonna lot empty houses Blackrock buy soon. business booming. Well, science true true. method. things thought true valid scientists longer accepted valid. static body knowledge. sets apart religion evidence based. Yes! Yeah issue US many counties low vaccination rates, like around 20%, areas like mine high rate 85%, make national average misleadingly high. I’m sure UK areas low vaccination community spread hospitalizations approach days vaccines. fact state's numbers bad earlier year, chunk population vaccinated scary. Delta last variant going problematic. 

How long variant affected current vaccine?

I personally think need national system (or even larger), verifiable proof vaccination, needs used keep people restaurants, bars, stores, events.

If want get vaccinated, fine, get play society can't protect public health. title amazing. reaction. ""no shit."" US states release apps compatible EU system. visit travel related subreddit you‘ll see Americans/Canadians asking card accepted EU countries require vaccinated visit restaurants on. course, also eliminates need carry weird paper card authenticity easily verified scanning QR code. people forgetting covid policies. Yeah, venue may check anything show up, don’t know day off. lot people probably went got vaccinated got tested lollapalooza checked every single person (which would impossible). 

Some reports saying 90% people attended lolla vaccinated. zero idea info determined since didn’t show proof besides front gates, believe large amount people go get vaccinated could attend lollapalooza, it’s got help bit policy place. buddy went got back said ""it awesome, even see covid."" Yes, explain can't see buddy. 

Is old high school friend used take bets entailing many blows head could take one night throwing passing out?

I think need better friends, sir. Wowzers, massive gathering needed experts tell us covid cases might come it?

I also heard experts rain wet! TIL! 
/s Right you. 

Pick socio-political circumstances would eagerly gotten it. 
 
But got hit wave politically-encouraged selfishness, reactionary anger, magical thinking got hit COVID. 
 
Really torpedoed belief goodness people (with ""good"" low bar, here, even). COVID guarantee immunity absolutely still vector transmission.

 ""This fair me!"" childish. words Spock, ""the needs many outweigh needs few"" part breaks human rights laws exclusion society.


If scared vaccine stay home. Ah yes people tried fight back. Silly me. point identification ""free"" concerted effort make harder get poorer communities. people ""against"" voters IDs even ID part. They're deck stacking masquerading legitimate concerns.  thoughts keep 1? likely/possible temporary? seems like delta wave consequence full reopen we've shouldered things settle permenantly. Thoughts? then? Saw Green Day Florida yesterday packed stadium. Vaccinated, rest party, wore mask part. regrets.   Hypothetical question - Say parallel universe, there's chance transmit Covid even vaccinated. even know Covid even one. wearing mask lessens risk transmitting Covid people. Would wear mask? sure. mind, overlap mentioned would visible Monster Jam attendants asked show proof gate. I'm inclined agree. Overall country fairly hands off, mask requirements, curfews etc. We've done better expected. have, day one, thought along lines describe... virus simply going run course. slow down, stop it.

Our ancestors somehow survived Black Plague, put things perspective. Maybe bad yet... festival flu real thing pre pandemic lol I’m sorry hear that, hope makes alive get vaccine aren’t risking you’re life, you’re immunocompromised you’re risk getting disease. Might well end society u/CaptianDavie scared. Alpha 1000x viral load compared original delta 1000x viral load compared alpha.

This bit misleading. virus increases start rapid rate, rather actual amount viral load given out. IE might multiply 50,000 viral particles second instead 5,000 first day. full infection 2-3 days, likely big difference. 

When talk stuff like viral loads, often hear *absurdly* large numbers talking increase billions billions. figures somewhat misleading. Delta actually 1,000 viral load Alpha, would R0 high enough infect entire classroom single second. Obviously case. Look India UK, cases recovering Delta outbreaks. Yikes. I'm speechless. reminding last year governments shutting beaches requiring masks outside kinds random counter-measures probably little/no impact spread end, spread happening first place. real issue small private indoor gatherings, there's much (Western) government those. leaders stand seen nothing, tried whatever easily *could* do. 
 
Same thing here. fundamental issue lot people getting vaccinated. *real* solution get people vaccinated. that's complicated forcing scope government powers. they're going try random shit keep optics waiting Delta burn out. (not American) expected US come digital certificates QR codes, SSN stuff. system place country. Vaccines cards seems dumb idea country insane number anti-vaxxers.    soon realizes dead Floridians dependable voters? Yeah, I'm sorry :( Except caveat infection spreads likely variants mutated strains, pose greater threat unvaccinated or, god forbid, put us back square one. People seem use ""death"" metric think mistake. Adults long haul issues even never hospitalized. Kids harder infect, spread lot easier. 

""People dying"" shitty metric. think silly approach given putting responsibility dealing unruly customers hands minimum wage employees. deal crap. Mike Bloomberg full shit.... say I’m speaking world I’m speaking US. whether likely able carrier,

From showed amount virus infected people carried—or viral load—was similar vaccinated unvaccinated patients. CDC concluded latter vaccinated people become infected might spread Delta variant readily unvaccinated.  know solid evidence, manage natural, easy would variant another new one, released general public? 
Yeah know ""you read much scfi"" think far fetched, especially world trying put viral fires limited cooperation What's /sad pathetic is, knows wrong. honestly believe shit he's saying. media definitely creating hysteria judgmental enough unvaccinated. unvaccinated deserve judged, shamed, excluded broader society wherever possible right thing.

Being unvaccinated complaining ""judged"" like guest shits everyone's floor complaining invited dinner parties. That's policy, 0 covid failure, nothing in-between. England already path   saying herd immunity point 80% plus likely won’t reached Delta vaccines don’t think administered fast enough outpace variant going everyone. don’t know plan lockdown can’t happen again.

The whole thing confusing me, news seems always bad.  Oh nice, app jank hell nice have. NYC accept though?  photo shared Facebook

Of fucking course. agree hope true. Trumpism cult personality. jury whether anyone else ride coattails White House. That's reported. alternative get tested negative fest, test negative fest. Test within 3 days day entered. Really, unvaccinated getting sick reaping sow. 

Call heartless, vaccinated people mostly going get mild illness get sick. hospitalizations and/or deaths consequence unvaccinated. 

The requirement vaccinated negative covid test checked, sure, probably fakes. But… actions consequences. fully consenting adults signing understanding exposed and/or becoming ill covid… don’t know much limit people done supposed anymore. People getting fed up, including myself. discounts fact variants going keep coming can't seriously reduce infections. Give Covid enough time, even vaccinated protected.

The fact numbers high many people vaccinated really, really scary us all. Right, point should’ve said vaccine required. negative test three days ago doesn’t really much getting even seem helpful terms timelines, three days quite while… shit sherlock, dumbasses approving kind festivals pikachu surprise face people start dying voters care dying. 100,000 people might seem like lot consider Chicago probably 80-90% population 2.7 million people likely put risky situation (indoor socializing, subway, office etc risky outdoors) past week. Lollapalooza outdoors, 90%+ people attended vaccinated, 10% show negative test get in. 

It cause infections, doubt, we're talking incredibly small amount infections percentage total amount infections likely happening chicago metro area given day. applies large gatherings people like focus on. None major gatherings gonna come close amount infections happening day day life. 600,000 Dead

More die CV.

Others die getting hospital access due CV filling hospital capacity.

Others suffer lifelong issues CV infection without vaccination suffering.

Yes media hysteria seems issue. Good root cause analysis.

If someone asked Evil...real evil looked like world I'd point this.

Desantis enablers committed Crimes humanity. Yes, hospitals open business PACKED. everyone's opinion's NY's decision requiere proof vaccination

It (requiring proof vaccination indoor dining, gyms, performances) along employers (private government) requiring employees return work keep jobs path forward. insurers declaring lack vaccination pre-existing condition covering Covid-related costs get Covid. We've exhausted previous approaches - trying persuade people facts logic followed offering carrot like $50 gift certificates, free park passes, lotteries, we're entering stick territory stick get bigger time. Border controls same. actually care vaccine passports often even look them. Things stopped making sense long time ago. No. remember people wishing aloud it, obvious pretty quickly govt incompetent get anywhere near fine response. 
 
I mean, yeah, week hope, lol became depressingly appropriate depressingly fast. really think read statement here. difference:

COVID vaccines free. available every pharmacy, hospital, mass government run pop-up shops, grocery stores McDonald's, even going door. Moreover, many places paying miss work covering Uber ride. Much lower. like 26% country vaccinated. unwillingness. short supply terrible planning government. stopped getting symptoms right got covid anti-bodies since got covid Somehow better nightmares 99 Woodstock Also since US large vaccinated population spreading virus less unchecked, working own, first home grown vaccine resistant version Covid! 

Made USA! Whooo! Oh wall wall coverage! Yes, next Lambda. 2x infectious Delta vaccine resistance implied early, small-scale studies (not decisive). variant ripping South America right now. studies suggest vaccinated people spread disease asymptotically 

Sure. incredibly small numbers. Get vaccine live life. get vaccine live bubble entire life. don’t care get vaccine. want live life constant fear go ahead. I’m Oops, brainfarted; forgot specify Covid hit (I'll edit comment). talking demographics go shows. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Take state. That’s federal issue chief. Damm!! Seriously? Good said that?

Nigeria vaccinated 2025, thats one richest countries Africa. 

We LEAST decade. Turns big pharmaceutical companies answer. Right well worked it? requirement protects legal liability. got lazy security check guy guess, happens. 

Now truly widespread outbreak maybe would liable really doubt it. 

They set requirements adult needed comply risk getting in. 

The fact requirements meant least people going get vaccinated did. Maybe 1 maybe 100 knows. probably add Florida list. guess stands reason. Covid causes problem. Vaccine part covid too. actually makes sense mitigation perspective too. surprised learn majority ppl testing positive past weeks LA high-income urban professional enclaves many restaurants located. caught off-guard many college-educated ppl 6 figure incomes forgoing shots, particularly 40. 

You think friends &amp; colleagues covid mindset you, really aren't. really sad come this, refusing shot &amp; still socializing eating out, putting everyone else around risk. that's unfair who've done part get vaccinated.  Window dressing disclaim responsibility.  It’s possible - it’s likely. Vaccine mandates American apple pie. long history mandatory immunizations assume FDA grants full approval vaccines, we’ll see mandates pop place. There’s enough precedent vaccine mandates legal challenge arduous uphill battle. I'm visiting son's birthday early September. I'm going try convince her. son covid get vaccinated after. worried she'll horrible experience. worst it'll day two feeling crappy. gotta beat another 104 weeklong fever. know data highly contested amd inaccurate, 500,000 reports adverse events Covid19 vaccines VAERS. Including 40k covid vaccine related hospitalizations.  I’m it. would remarkable thing mutation happen event, infect person strongly enough transmitting virus, interact enough people also infected strain others. saying possible, would almost certainly circulating beforehand event super spread it.  state, companies cannot mandate business state. lose state contracts do. shocked find businesses never would thought business state do. 

My company even require masks sitting desk. we're back office four days week. Vote Desantis killed.off grandparents early sweet inheritance. owe him.your vote./s can't wait next couple weeks. Delta go vrooom. Lyft provides free rides get vaccinated $15 way. Hope everyone keeps energy Rolling loud Miami, people Covid restrictions all. Apparently there's two kinds people: fools niave fools mean saying lollapalooza potential super spreader?

Maybe stop listening bias sources So, spent last months focusing masks instead getting people vaccinated? can't win primary without them, though. crazies decide gets party's nomination. response gets it. 

100k+ people coming city country different vs 40k mostly locals (stadium capacity Wrigley Guaranteed Rate). wondering, front line staff (doctors nurses) tired now. aren't, kudos them. Hell, I've caught bottles would still let take in. live NC. went back school yesterday. Masks made optional. Already got first phone call today notifying us positive case school. It’s second day. kids masked, minority still risk exposure quarantine. 97% mexican covid hospitalizations unvaccinated individuals, vast majority eligible get shots months... people like this? California implemented digital vax cards stored phone. Mines Apple wallet. I’m sure there’s equivalent Android. Hopefully states well cause it’s way better carrying around card Even less work thought Okay let’s necessarily go road leads bud. sub nutshell? fucked around found A) Children major disease vectors, doesnt matter they're relatively unharmed it. still spread like crazy.

B) dont even know talking ""why children arent required"" statement... children arent *eligible* get vaccine hasnt fully FDA approved yet. Thats issue hand. Well didnt realize werent checking turn let through. also first show weekend werent even shows base of. knew that, phone least, Staples made seem like going super anal all. don’t think shutting society classifies “growing society”. odds dying either incredibly low. Lower getting car accident, yet drive every day. Risk inherent every part life, stop happy prevent death futile. People need able enjoy lives, it’s worth living first place. much problem vaccinated though. one ones risk, immuno-compromised, PPE wear extended close contact indoors potentially unvaccinated people virtually 100 effective. 

No need make absolutely everybody miserable. besides, aren’t even sure non-immuno-compromised vaccinated people spread significant extent. attend, people either provide Covid-19 vaccine card proof negative Covid-19 test previous 72 hours,

I'm really curious see well worked. thought combined amount people either couldn’t take vaccine wouldn’t would better 10-20 percent, maybe 30 we’d still close herd. Well, shit. Masking public least anyone heavy focus masking US position currently in. telling willing ever meet new people socialize public again? Hi, pretty old posted times. also allow edited titles. Someone (smart) could've figured pulled 20% ass said ""I can't imagine 20%"" offered source number. Maybe try keep next time waste mine. Intelligent people shown historically less kids.

Stupid people breed comprehend consequences. It’s (D)iffrent mean, mRNA vaccines still gold standard even Delta risk infection severity drastically reduced. every person family mRNA-vaccinated great shape. thankful deal deniers! doctor suggesting continue like last year decades isn’t likely happen. Endemic doesn’t mean “at deadly, society-shutting levels.” need help looking bad, almost every time fired Twitter. thing people tend listen beyond conspiracies risk losing money.

You faith society do. Oh look people fun living life  Damn, kinda care. now

The biggest issue that, unlike H1N1, COVID pandemic yet medical community warning risk unvaccinated young children due new variants (like Delta).

 Dr. Elumalai Appachi, pediatrician-in-chief Children’s Hospital San Antonio, said he’s seeing increase adolescents children eligible vaccine ending ER ICU, previous surges. “Now seeing healthy children coming serious COVID-19 illness vaccinated,” Appachi said.

The news full reports like week. 

Previous pandemics, 1918 influenza, famously multiple waves later waves hitting younger healthier people most. reality pandemic unvaccinated risk, especially new future variants. think policy place say hey don’t show without vaccine proof help lot though many people won’t risk chance super strict.

Right that's entire point. Impractical make 100% foolproof government mandates database something vaccine proof person prior attending. 

The requirement resulted 9/10 people right thing. Canada, like 3 different huge protests city throughout pandemic, every single time people freaked many cases would generate. Every time happen. 

The virus real hard time spreading outdoors. said fine. God... mean, influenza pretty fucked own. bad case leave lasting effects bad case covid.

There's real apples-to-apples comparison made many people *are* vaccinated influenza *nobody* vaccinated covid first year. Even total herd immunity form flu, partial immunity effective preventing full-scale breakout like saw last year. *ever* gotten flu shot, better unvaccinated person, even shot years ago (obviously recent flu shot better).

Since people *some kind of* flu immunity (whether vaccines previous illness), generally seasonal flu one handful strains cycle through, seen truly uncontrolled pandemic since Spanish Flu (we know certain, many epidemiologists believe novel/long-time dormant strain almost popular immunity). I'm grad school work education. 

People elementary school work master's program unvaccinated still.

We work poor communities Los Angeles, students come families may even suitable access healthcare, puts greater risk, pass anything on.

I'm super disappointed supposedly educated people give damn kids families. I’m Florida, perspective you’re already wrong. Hospitalizations state 2000 highest prior peak, still climbing end sight. Don’t need expert tell people this… someone went four days, security guards make sure wristband card ready next security gates. Anecdotal, friends’ vaccine cards taken hands someone verified day specific health check gate (not ID anything could theoretically copied someone else’s) wasn’t lax news clip portrayed as. Following Rick Scott's footsteps. CDC classify public, indoor location? recommend masking situations, officially recommend masking private gathering everyone vaccinated?

(I know answer question objectively yes, people actually want see person probably go whatever CDC says) companies testing current new vaccines versus Delta Plus, variant capable breakthrough infections right now. mass protests spread covid, fine Australia NZ lockdowns worked treat, least Delta. Western countries certainly lockdown fine. said weren’t properly checking. Seems weird expose five yes old know weren’t checking.  course!!! good day man saying believe innocent proven guilty yet believe sick proven healthy.  mean mayor's politicians enacting lockdowns? know many ones wearing masks? 

It's also incredibly unlikely vaccinated individual contract, pass disease. asking wear mask incredibly low number. 

To say - end? risk contracting disease low, risk spreading contracting even lower. thresholds making decisions? mean, numbers astronomically low. nobody gave shit first time, shut everything less severe disease (in children)?? drive unless.i to. I'm calling schools forced back virtual 9/13.

I hate say it, feel even optimistic take days. gut, hope wrong, says states districts looking pretend pandemic matter *how* bad things get.

Again, hope I'm wrong. Duh Totally irrational. know. think pharmacist checked insurance, got authorization, gave shot. 

I don’t think would happened digital record receiving vaccine.

FWIW, indicated received JnJ vaccine written form don’t think pharmacist checked form assumed first shot.  place went pre-screen electronically previous vaccine. wore masks rigouis testing system know much virus. Vaccinated also carry transmit virus assuming infectious? NYC commuting city lots. Rural PA NJ travel NYC work. Without border mandate stop spread NYC, wrongly assuming someone infectious proof. Sadly, true Probably biggest threat us given day, yet drive nary thought. going people next year year clamoring remain indoors saying NEXT variant going one breaks vaccine Exactly. Horrible situation shutting society permanently ridiculous pretty much ineffective considering disease endemic. scary thing Florida slightly national avg vaccinations preview what’s come states unless start vaccinating quicker. Even California may see repeat happened last winter don’t start vaccinating lot more. vaccinated people? matter. people refuse vaccinate them. Sometimes adverse effects observed next generation offspring. Even approved forms birth control cause birth defects mutations past. Current vaccines make ~25x less likely end hospital. means surge would need FAR larger winter surge hospital capacity risk. going happen. know ""downvote"" mean ""dislike"" want people see this, can't help anymore. see guy's face downvote button happens. girlfriend (27) managed get second dose today calling pharmacies week get slightly ahead 8 week mark. Meanwhile younger siblings back US doses months ago now. Could draw attention anywhere article mentions stay-at-home? read spot one anywhere. Mu...that's real scary shit. big difference may UK's vaccination rate *relatively* uniform, US varies highly vaccinated areas whole states little protection. absolutely dumb politically I’m expert, shit Source? I'm pretty sure everyone vaccination; one advocating it...am wrong? prioritized young first back spring care... Yep, I'm boat mentally. 

I 100% understand still get covid spread mutation virus function unvaccinated population protect them...but im done. 

I'm less likely die covid (as fully vaccinated person) thr flu. dont live ever see immuno suppressed people. kids old enough child risk covid extremely low (even delta).

I'm gonna live fear morons alter life protect them. anyone's employer required weekly testing unvaccinated people?

We're contemplating curious employers implementing this. 
Whether provide testing on-site. pay hourly workers time get tested. Also, allow antigen PCR tests. It’s cool. probably put /s there. Trust me, highest respect Dr Fauci; fact continued work common good despite huge amount irrational resistance received many Republicans impressive.  got mine mid-April too, still fighting get pass working. also worked health field. mean shit I'm doctor neither would said it. 

I know many kids, mine one wanted irresponsible? child comes contact immunocompromised kid gives asymptomatic covid kills them? put seatbelt put kid car seat possibility accident. go swimming thunderstorm possibility. 

How protecting child children hurt anyone? know children generally show symptoms great carrying it. know kids gross understand social distancing. great news needs shouted rooftops. It’s old assholes. 97% efficacy means every 100 unvaccinated people get covid 97 would prevented TIMESPAN would vaccinated. mean 97% people take vaccine immune virus. Expose people enough virus lot maybe even still going infected. I'll feel way kids able get vaccine Im NY teacher, building 100% vaccinated, really dont understand NYSUTs stance this. Im extremely confused. That’s Mr. Nano Body SHIT  Yes, vaccinated people usually mild symptoms, get that. 

The guy replied suggesting forgoing basic precautions masks trying 'level up' immune system repeated exposure, ticket perfect immunity.

The immune boost infection gives temporary.

Getting immune boost infection never going safer remaining uninfected.

A vaccine booster shot much smarter, safer way everyone get protection.

Breakthrough infections, *usually* milder, **do** still kill people.

A recent study showed roughly 20% breakthrough patients went suffer Long Covid symptoms. 

So, I'm gonna stick guns here, say smart idea forgo things like vaccines masks plan get stronger repeated exposure infection. Well COVID less deadly 6 year old H1N1 back ‘09 precautions taken whatsoever. 1,800 died H1N1 compared 350 COVID. Rest assured, odds astronomically referring risk disease, hospitalization death among unvaccinated vs. vaccinated people: National estimate

&amp;#x200B;

There difference incidence COVID disease, incidence SARSCoV2 infection. Nope, dumb person. believe science. everyone vaccinated surge would happen. “Both buckled unbuckled passengers die auto accidents, requiring seatbelts usage isn’t going fix anything.” many from, many not. capabilities decide. One head read individual reports, decide themselves. person asked data.  There's data, hodgepodge may be.  falsifying death records illegal? delta variant, mutated transmissible version virus, level virus infected vaccinated people “indistinguishable” level virus noses throats unvaccinated people, Walensky said. Funny people like talk vaccine anti-vaxxers do. Cover bullets bleach!! issue people sub like seeing people fun, *especially* public *especially* people. last year, socially awkward, basement-dwelling lifestyle accepted, *encouraged*. They're quite ready give up.

Is *everyone* sub? No, obviously, population *definitely* overrepresented here. This. sub filled Americans
But understandable time majority Redditors Americans equally contagious, asymptomatic vaccinated person dramatically likely go public, maskless close quarters others, symptomatic unvaccinated person. asymptomatic person likely cause transmission difference behavior.

Millions people impression getting vaccines meant able catch transmit virus - public health officials assured them. acted accordingly. "" happened Papa?""
 ""He died vapors. people actually faced tangible consequences receiving vaccine, might mess. That's vaccine mandates needed.

Meanwhile, thousands thousands doses getting thrown trash US ""no one wants them."" infuriating. Either proof vaccination required negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours. exceptions.  Question actually implemented? Supposedly enforced 6 weeks… might back then… Also what’s timeline supposed look like then? Sadly can’t feel optimistic think chances actually happening ratter low walk-in clinic today 10 minutes walk lives. doesn’t. covid? Get shot. vaccine reduces chance infection (per exposure). also significantly reduces severity symptoms, accordingly chance hospitalisation death.

It perfect blocker virus, vaccine is. black white situation attempting sell as.  tell CDC changed guidance masking, knowing full well vaccinated people could still spread COVID unvaccinated US nowhere near herd immunity?

Instead saying, ""Once country 70% fully vaccinated, stop masking!"", went ""Vaccinated people take masks whenever even vaccinations high community!"" even ""Vaccinated people unmask around vaccinated small private gatherings!"" 

Without way verify who's vaccinated isn't, CDC's then-new guidance opened worms willfully unvaccinated could take advantage. Masses maskless unvaccinated people clearly led surge we're seeing unvaccinated vaccinated, almost focus vaccinated people wearing masks therein lies issue. lie it. Say it. ;) wearing masks decades Japan it’s worth. interested know fastest possible infection time is, viruses. Like biological limit fast happen? delta variant really seconds that's really quick.  Hopefully they’ll died along virus. Israel screwed denominator data process correcting that. heard Doctor Radio hours ago. Apparently correct number much, much better. sure political calculus here, appears gamble. We'll see happens kids start ending hospital due delta. We'll see stiff spine remains. According study lists ""multiple events Barnstable County July 3-17"" cursory google search bring event list. unless hand, call bullshit. People say vaccinated people spread more, we're dealing really dumb people. bring could bring…. 

Glad see people priorities straight. Wished event sponsored Black Lives Matter way covid passed on. definitely possible scenario, I'm going wager Trump's health going decline actually run 2024. However, grift cult followers hundreds millions lead election cycle. when? You’re never going 100% vaccinations zero cases continue showing card door? kind stupid busted ass country people want live can’t go pizza place block without show card get in? got vaccine could go back life was, they’re saying still quarantine get contact tracing call show card door? Jesus whole frontpage basically US news. point /r/coronavirusUS guess? Fell fast India could not. wash hands. both, one big difference UK Israel that's obvious measurable. kids 5 can’t get vaccinated.

The vaccine need booster.


Then booster need new vaccine new variant.

It’s going take years stop virus rely vaccinations… Well, personally do. I’m social meatspace.

So, approximately 50 vaccinated people know work relatives, one got confirmed covid, moderate symptoms, two months fully vaccinated. works mall without mask mandate, he’s exposed lots unmasked (and also unvaxxed) people daily.

He worried he’d passed staff, one dose two point, fine. videos people holding piece paper people (west least) gate even looking. People sharing 'vaccine passport' images print home. piece paper doctor writing all. That’s spirit . masks unbearable virus viruses . I’m surprised y’all keep playing along game It’s honestly tremendously disappointing see many nasty little views held society 12 year old true. always expected people willing trample dead bodies continue routine... Delta, stronger variant comes breakthroughs, spreading.  people vaccinated months ago, spread would slower. Take minutes really try think one through. still dropping

Cases still *rising*, lower rate. UK 1,241,308 active cases (vs 1,236,234 yesterday), highest case count country world, apart US. 
Source: unvaccinated worth risk go? Would family go? (I'm similar position SIL husband see unless gets vaccinated.) That's excellent idea. something like planes airline banning barcode scanned twice (since obviously booting unfeasible...) Rough estimates CDC presentation standard masks used general public (from memory, don’t front me) 75-85% effective source control 20-30% effective personal protection. course, properly used masks increase proportion, properly fitted masks meant personal protection same. Even high vaccination area, masks still recommended universally transmission substantial high (which would suggest vaccination isn’t actually high…). area highly vaccinated transmission substantial high, CDC guidelines recommend universal masking vaccinated individuals.

I don’t understand question re: Dr. Gupta.

As last point: people lots thoughts feelings variety topics. That’s nicest thing say, someone going rabbit hole claiming conspiracy afoot to… take control… make people cover faces… they’re pocket Big Anti-Lipstick something, it’s hard reason that. That’s communication important — explain reasons recommendations acknowledge things changing. Cheney Bush Texas, Cheney pretended Wyoming 2000. 

I think there's actual law it, unwritten rule. Trump would care anything like that. true since CDC recommendation days ago vaccinated people get test unless symptomatic. asymptomatic cases among vaccinated counted all. There's also lot people bothered get vaccine two months ago case counts low, they're they're considering it.

I mean, kind selfish justification, least rational. Please go back read explanation data anomalies NYT data.

Then read again.

Then think minute.

There spike New York March.

Here's JHU New York dashboard: official state level New York data New York state (not including NYC), timeframe earlier comment: spike. seeing *appears* decline spike reporting issues. already clearly explained.  misleading CDC use 163 million vaccinated contracted virus. scanned sewbrilliant's reddit history, Doubtful medical industry, takes, much longer till rooted out.  


I feel protecting kids covid, seems long term knows something goes dormant comes back later. children Depression/anxiety it.  


Just asymptomatic mean virus anything, means body realize fight it.     Yeah, mean probably would've gone still lived Chicago, crowds completely different sporting events give week school starts multiple classrooms remote learning outbreak. again. Parents going get pissed seasawing. I've lost count many people know it, neighbours know, half everyone work with, roughly half friends.

Some family members none household.

Plenty people fairly open it, strange thing earliernitnwas gradual drip drip, since left lockdown time delta, seems like every day know another person.

I also work building sites, get tested twice week time they've said worse ever terms positive tests they're seeing induction days! difference new cases fatalities enormous. Dude.  AdCOVID appeared provide sterilizing immunity used conjunction vaccines. would great 1-2 approach would embraced, one company trying provide all-encompassing solution. UK went Delta scare May, Neil Ferguson predicting 100,000 cases day - cases exploded momentarily plummeted. India's cases, thing - plummeted.  We’ll fuck makes life difficult everyone.

the employees enforce it

the vaccinated paperwork them



the vaccinated paperwork, wait line ""papers please""

and unvaxxed refused service potentially become hostile towards emploeyees. could wrong, ever get point strictly enforcing people could visit one another's houses? thought didn't. 
 
Regardless, that's really point. point measures effective, measures easy, always align. there's plenty precedent American/European governments focusing latter rather former. AUS/NZ actually great examples something difficult yet effective shut outside world. direct metric that. closest metric (viral load) somewhere around 30% reduction, grade-school math highschool reading comprehension that's required know good indicator. That's nobody responsible medical mathematical professions saying anything it, idea. one hear CT value, also significant improvements, tiny piece currently practical application direct transmission risk. [A Coronavirus Epidemic Hit 20,000 Years Ago, New Study Finds - New York  make us worry,” said David Enard, evolutionary biologist University Arizona led study, published Thursday journal Current Biology. “What going right might going generations generations.” Yeah, Trump Trump.

Yeah, I’m sure you’re trying say Buy license key portal Uh, no. live utopia everyone vaxxed masks unnecessary. 

Out real world, vaxxed you’re carrying heavy viral load Delta - cause unvaxxed, since best solution (vax everyone) slow impossible, masks remain helpful. there's hell know individuals like Abbot Desantis living rest lives. amount lives they've cost poor decisions unreal. TN here. governor said want masks schools. GOP state leaders said school district tries mandate masks call special session governor outlaw something. Also, governor offering vouchers literally pay tourists come state. governor isn’t sadistic DeSantis, sure dumb. Look surprised face. honestly need research viral spread among vaccinated little bit more.  know obvious lot people lack common sense think H1N1 pretty big deal actually? Yeah average person isn’t gonna 35 person orgy top eachother. 

So many bodily fluids exchanged. 

Come bro, come on. fucking duh Yes fair. Except can’t. can’t explain can’t eat restaurant go exercise despite antibodies present vaccinated people can. It’s even unvaxx personally. I’m going back normalcy.   covid last November I’m fully vaccinated (JJ completed month ago) today chills aches. odds case break natural vaccine immunity? hear you, I'm assuming people doctorate degrees sufficient scientific literacy. problem abusing access information defying countering messages CDC.  ""We've done nothing, we're ideas"" variant. Fuck Ron Johnson Im finally able get first shot week, can't wait! hope I’m wrong! There's several studies showing Moderna bit better Pfizer *at sterilizing immunity*, already knew good bit better J&amp;J original. likely (based studies) J&amp;J followed shot moderna even better.

Oh irony. talking nonsense. question vaccine prevent getting delta think vaxxed people aren’t gonna spreading ""Deadly"" low bar. really thing, trust me. Add grad students, admin staff, etc plus frat parties living dorms together. currently modeling might indicate fairly steep dive cases short term? mean today like 60.6% fully vaccinated. Add roughly 20%+ (maybe conservative) already infected sort natural immunity play well. We've got slightly north 80% people country sort protection now. would think within matter weeks, cases potentially plummet. Simple math would indicate we're running naive hosts rapidly unless I'm missing something. Overshoot play here? Chime in. gotta close end point. Delta final true player horrible game? assume votes coming people reading accept fact universal healthcare nowhere near perfect. 

I lived 6 different countries role company work. (Ireland, Germany, US, Spain, Australia Taiwan), tend get sick often.

I'd say best public healthcare system far Taiwan Australia, problem European countries healthcare systems I've used part long queue schedule actual appointment, lack medical supplies. suffer this, Spain worst verge bankruptcy I've heard. one point decided go private healthcare system never go back. virus 100% politicized US, counties elected leaders really mismanaged crisis. Several leaders around world really f’ed up, opted downplay virus justify piss poor response. 

That said, almost every US doctor vaccinated. turn political news talk doctor, they’ll tell shot make sense. Tax them. Tax unvaccinated people imposing extra work health sector adding funds dealing upcoming variants. waivers incapable getting vaccines due legitimate health reasons. refused comply tax, jailed (not long, say, 7 days) vaccination mandatory.

Its ridiculous way thinking. drugs show adverse reaction right away years later. hundreds hundreds medication approved FDA health official bodies 5 10 years taken market due long term effects  
 caused cancer heart trouble things nature. Saying well see anything first two months means safe wishful thinking data. Plus pretending people experiencing side effects already also true. risks taking vaccine risks taking vaccines, individual decide government. 

I born authoritarian state moved North America escape control get choice goes body mind. perception reasonable government mandate different exact reason call free country. want trade false sense security exchange less choices go asking everyone else consider reasonable. 

I really get need force someone else think right you. know still get infected even fully vaccinated infected obviously spread it. Pointing vaccinated already infected wrong factual all. Bragging vaccinated therefore somehow able get sick spread disease also accurate deal need control everyone's decisions kind false sense security suppression personal anxiety. 

Unvaccinated person today dangerous vaccinated person today. Contact Infected person risky regardless vaccinated. Pretending otherwise dishonest. want encourage others take vaccine risk come might give protection severe sickness covid, great go right head, saying vaccinate somehow danger others true. I'm sorry data there. Humans dangers other, INFECTED virus present risk vulnerable. Everything else anecdotal hogwash politicized used manipulate. fearmongering, ""narrative"". 

So previously, data suggested vaccinated people could spread delta variant vaccine effective reducing viral load nose throat. However, new data delta suggests that, actually, given much viral load variant produces, sufficient load throat nose vaccinated people spread it.

However, change fact vaccine still effective preventing hospitalization death. effective stopping spread. difference ""narrative"" really ability spread, ability prevent severe symptoms/death.  gap got wider. Good job Biden. Vaccine mandates? really US? lol okay meant completely back normal without virus central lives way. it’s back normal everywhere mask mandates back many places restrictions soon brought back likely. don’t need reasons dislike man, hypotheticals opposite real world actions certainly necessary, helpful, endeavor.

Pick plenty real-world decisions made actions taken. plenty go on. Whoosh whoosh whoosh. 99.9% unvacvinated people died covid. Fact me, red meat tastes like candy can't wear certain perfumes anymore.  Every month two taste/smell changes up, one month everything tasted like popcorn. Yet I'm in. I'm glad I'm vaccinated.  libertarian ‘the 1968 flu vaccine made brother weirdo’ dad finally got J&amp;J vaccine last week. also Covid late December/early January.

And, yes, continuous staffing issues. plethora studies showing single vaccine dose infection extremely good, second one anything. Many countries recommend waiting 90 days - one study showed antibody variety maxed around 6 months, theory would ideal time get dose long-lasting immunity. Benazir hours Russian handlers give instructions it. surprised see 180 do. nobody knows kompromat him, must damning. think Figure 2 source bit meaningful headline statistic. seems around 1-5% covid cases breakthrough cases.

[Here's total vaccinations type July 11.5 million

Pfizer 7.3 million

Janssen 1.13 million

So 5.55 million figure probably fully vaccinated. Janssen least common vaccine given highest rate breakthrough. total breakthroughs could still lower AZ

[This says July 16, 11.6% 52 million fully vaccinated (which would 6 million guess total numbers fluid) 30% least 1st dose. 757 comments... uffda.

I sit father tomorrow morning, try convince get vaccine. Hes 60. trying find good article shows breakdown ages died due covid 19. Anyone know good link good data set? USA id like data USA. r/nottheonion truly blows mind we’re spot time convince, strong arm bribe people getting vaccine. fucking vaccine whole proven safe effective. Absolutely baffles me.  COVID started last year, since she’s front lines. also December. Everyone vaccinated except her. still antibodies, lot nurses said getting vaccinated. problem voters. True. always hear terrible stories it. taste buds still working too. Good old weekend reporting. gotten covid again?? Sounds like % people dieing covid he's gone would it?  within 2 3 weeks could 70% completely vaccinated 

Good job I’ve trying dig too, doesn’t appear it’s deadly definitely contagious. think it’s apparently since vaccinated verses another factor patients history prior vaccine, wasn’t factor still risk death. That’s I’ve reading swear seems change daily. Ok fucking stupid. logic makes sense, shut diners inside regain control shit!! makes sense wear mask inside restaurant knowing good well take eat goes restaurant . fucking illogical counter intuitive!! shit getting old along anti vaxx fuck heads want make life miserable everyone. feel like kinda stuff lauded talking heads news. antibodies year infection Sad multiple choice question. 99.999% sounds like impressive number, see fatality rate US 1.8% see age groups make That’s science!!! peer reviewed. 
""SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant exhibits higher infectivity immune resistance""
Hoping someone information. really need vaccine targets delta variant. know lot people seem content vaccine prevents severe illness don’t want sick covid period.  person pretending certain political belief system make side aisle look bad. Multiple people it. improv laugh pure joy. Gene Wilder real one. One J&amp;J plus natural immunity enough least take teeth future reinfection. also understand cult leaders said it’s bad, pretty simple think probably idiocy. That's terrible, know better. work covid patients all? think hit nail head 

We never tough conversation time accept we've lowered risk covid poses average person much we're going move treating way flu 

Now time conversation fast approaching nobody handling policy wants broach topic Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

What saying outbreaks campus able grow effectively *if everyone required vaccinated*.

Rt vaccinated-to-vaccinated transmission less one, vaccines effective preventing infection altogether. keep breakthrough cases really, really low. different scenario one ~70% campus vaccinated. case, disease spread effectively among unvaccinated, also creating many opportunities breakthrough infections.  headline says all. referring deadly cases among vaccinated people. I’ll take weeks dystopian full year+ covid free living. damn well know 15 months effective part mask wearing preventing spread infected person. swear I'm going scream one person tells kids wear masks. means permanent ban sub. Advocating celebrating someone's death illness results automatic permanent ban. opposite would ""Vaccines hot"" still sounds convincing lol kids started back school today, others tomorrow schools said mandate masks social distancing. They're pretending covid exist point. :\  Delay. Pregnancy = immune compromised. Full stop. 

If weren’t pregnant, relative risk wouldn’t bad, wear well fitted n95 plane airport mitigate it. pregnancy issue, 1 year old, lower risk severe disease overall, bit higher risk catching disease since neither vaccinated going mask travel. Yeah almost ended democracy candidate obviously lost lets force vaccinated see many people doctors nurses kill. thanks let crazies work companies want them.  LOL San Francisco mask mandate included San Francisco Health Officer strongly encourages individuals wear masks [...] taking part indoor gatherings private homes members households.

Yeah, fully expect people fully vaccinated wear masks hanging friends game night dinner also fully vaccinated. Lmao. Yea nobody wants guy sent vaccines away thought need them. Still wish trimmed inventory bit case. Moderna Pfizer. mRNAs consistently higher efficacy ratings. However feel this, one many reasons Singapore fare better countries. choose limiting thoughts something mundane logistics? certainly achievable. Friend teacher Texas. vaccinated, one breakthrough cases. said one school wearing masks. said use PTO time quarantine. know frustrated said tempted leave profession together.  It’s anger denial long war. I’m 33, kiss prospect sense normality goodbye rest 30s sure maybe rest life tbh. feel like pandemic restriction lifestyle literally going go decades - seems like end. depressed. Biden’s covid advisor said masks don’t work.

He particularly, quite clearly, talking **cloth** masks. Cloth masks indeed quite crap, one much better wearing surgical mask. n95 respirators do. 

No, say n95 respirators work. said better. time what? Shitty like, South America. Super shitty areas like Cambodia certain parts Middle East. really hope we’re going. least require vaccination passports herd immunity becomes possible. right now, husband I, along 3 oldest boys (19, 17 &amp; 14) vaccinated. Unfortunately, little guy 6, get ready send back school next week required protections all, really wish private industry would make life difficult unvaccinated. shopping. dining out. movie theaters. trips hair salon. Make unvaccinated’s lives extremely difficult frustrating point vax seems like viable solution end shit already! covid ends 1% death disability rate per year, runs population year, bypasses immunity time, worst case scenario could honestly end civilization. death thousand cuts. likely however, direction seems mutating, something rule out. too! good luck school :D vaccine accomplishes that, goal, one achieved it.

Due dynamic evolving nature viruses, providing total immunity realistic goal. Even accomplish it, inevitably end strain capable breakthrough cases. Viruses game much, much longer have.

That said, I'm sure can't bit both. Ending infections unachievable ideal, realistic goal. realistic goal reduce death illness. Even fully preventing entirely realistic, given statistics.

No vaccine entirely prevents infection transmission. People need stop forgetting this. Measles always great example. two doses, measles vaccine roughly 97% effective preventing infection, they've making vaccine since 60s. Sixty years later still fully effective. vaccine intended keep getting Covid. intended keep hospital. 99.999% hospitalized people UNVACCINATED. Also, hope recover expeditiously. meant positive cases still seem factor someone fully vaccinated, they're counted total cases. I'd imagine schools going want test students outbreak campus. They'll still test students regardless vaccination status.

Even someone vaccinated they're considered breakthrough case they're showing symptoms total number breakthrough cases likely higher 125,683, since nine states, including Pennsylvania Missouri, provide information, 11, like Covid hotspot Florida, provide death hospitalization totals. Four states gave death hospitalization numbers, full tally vaccinated adults breakthrough cases show symptoms could missing data altogether, say Independent serious is, ""at least one hour"" sound like many. Miss Lindsay article says SAGE consider possibility, happen sooner later. Many Conservatives pushing garbage stats audience eating up. White House encouraging communicators include related stats help contextualize garbage stats.

I think issue enough focus put stats actually mean - contributes folks comfortable ignoring stats together. bad reaction based know generally good thing. immune system working build disease fighting muscles! hate think he’s ACTUALLY stupid yet acts way purely political pandering  Pfizer Moderna better J&amp;J. Pfizer billions fines fraud, example. wore bullet proof vest someone waving around loaded gun next finger trigger..

You'd still duck. Noted. thought sarcasm implied. could without overburdening health care system I'm pretty much point agree. hate saying feel like dick it, enough enough. I've done needed get back normal reality we're back heading exactly pre-vaccine, less death. Hospitals still going filling unvaccinated still give shit, let die off. I'm fucking shit. give much credit. Remember also refused get tested debating Jaime Harrison use plastic barriers. study (small sample) showed 79% infected vaccinated symptomatic, 80% hospitalized infected vaccinated. point vaccines. vaccines prevent hospitalizations deaths first foremost, anything else bonus. *audible laugh* fuck? people ALREADY got severe mild cold COVID vaccine. fact, 99% 30 severe COVID symptoms sans vaccination. possible way tell vaccines “working” look results old people. Severe cases already incredibly rare young healthy people you’ll never able tell vaccine helped lower risk population. Fuck around find I'm done Indeed, aware evidence Australia, possibility fleeting transmission. understand it, data small enough meaningful assessing risk outside interactions, confounded significantly different social distancing constraints. California entirely different political environment, essentially possibly driving transmission levels seen Australia. Given this, expect officials believe that, balance, value outdoor masking (as currently understand it) worth cost. Like Republican stronghold Detroit Certainly lifted peer reviewed paper. vaccine never said effective infection, number symptomatic infection. (Also delta that's around 88%)

I remember seeing/there hard numbers fully stopping infections. Pulling numbers butt, I'd quess around 60% old variants around 35% delta. Yeah, can’t remember time I’ve gone store pharmacy didn’t signs offering flu shots, kind incentive.  think depends. states might issue, southern states absolute worst hospitalizations/deaths wise.  Don’t worry still go Arkansas State reduce lifetime earnings $20 million. would live fire citizens? plenty liberals mandatory vaccination.  imagine unvaccinated people likely know someone died hospitalized.

The pool likely get hospitalized getting smaller people get vaccinated. matter opinion

That's opinion. Never heard Jama, WSJ owned Rupert Murdoch it’s pretty much like Fox News.  seen *very limited*, **not yet peer-reviewed**, study [outdoor transmission wedding would try /r/COVID19, bit science-y Inb4 freaks saying covid already lab accident Same! neighbors daughter grade mine school. first excited girls neighbors friends, hung huge Q flag end drive. We’ve keeping distance since happened. patience crazy gone. 

I’m glad good day! I’m sure he’ll make friends class shortly. understand though. daughter’s best friends two grades ahead her. 

That encouraging masks! swear kids mature adults are. 

I hope family great week! pretty much entire state Florida. wonder Taco Bell closing dining room again. different R0 somewhat reduced antibody response constitute different behaviour therefore strains question. realise difficult one, thresholds strains viruses? I'm sure two markers alone make case, since expectation degree diversity within strain - i.e. range phenotypes account varying antibody resistance.

I understand P values quite well, meaningless without knowing test derived from. saying different P &lt; 1% really valid. Also we're pedantic would P &lt; 0.01, no? think pandemic, debate, destroy it. One lab accident takes unleash hell. literal rock bottom minimum. fair also true unvaccinated. Yes basing said criteria ""suspected"" ""confirmed"" given by

r/WhiteHairedFoxgirl

I going criteria. seem saying criteria actually ones use. guess probably read said responding me. 

So still unclear ""suspected"" ""confirmed"" determined, added ""asymptomatic"". saying four categories, reported together transfers categories?

I trying compare PRC US (I'm US anyways), trying understand determine cases PRC (so what's happening US UK relevant help understand that). still clear ""case"" PRC means. Gasoline smells great though…. pandemic unvaccinated

But, know isn't, CDC recommending masks vaccinated, well. Rather anxious something unconfirmed, go get tested. way, you’ll know whether need postpone trip there’s still chance getting money refunded.

There lot colds right now, odds getting one still higher getting Covid you’re fully vaxxed. get tested you’ll know whether actual breakthrough case.

I believe 10 days still recommended period, let check I’ll edit. longer hopeful anymore. still don’t think pandemic talks restrictions masks ever end goal posts seem forever change.

The rise vaccinations doesn’t seem significant seems slight. Don’t think ever get herd immunity alone. Hopefully twenty years things finally seem like they’re improving scientists tell us it’s safe live lives I’ll laugh myself! I’d add this: dont encourage new teachers. one enter teaching profession. It’s antiworker fucked. People complying mandates, what's purpose making people complying. 
People especially comply age groups vaccinated people vaccinated want punish unvaccinated anything protect them. I’m fully vaccinated come realize going last well 2022 2023. guess I’m vaccinated need live life best now? got 2 doses short little sting days next vaccinne annoying af, especially work days long we're discussing useless information disguised important facts, let's forget 100% King Penguins living Antarctica deadly Covid-19 breakthrough cases either!  last weekend, it’s already started crowded Can’t speak countries, Brazil could probably attributed longstanding vaccination drive public health care.

Vaccines long time free easy get due public health system government even went far create mascot vaccination named “Zé Gotinha” (something like John Droplet) 80s drive vaccination kids polio. he’s used ever since then. vaccination culture ended generational thing point we’re kinda used it. bosses work even follow rules they've put place, expect enforce rules anyone else. meant breakthrough cases Delta vs. Alpha OG SARS-CoV-2. numbers CDC keeps vaccinated people breakthrough cases went hospital died, that's numbers are. So, headline 1% fully vaccinated people experience *breakthrough case* misleading. coupled fact range data looking largely OG Alpha variant, means can't really take away much already shown countries who've dealt Delta ahead us: breakthrough cases involving hospitalization death far rare vaccinated individuals vaccinated. feel like time like this, vaccinated people need realize still catch spread virus dangerous people 12 immunocompromised folks. headline represents 1 100 chance contract virus symptoms whereas likely closer [4 Sunday/Monday cases trickle next days. Depending tracking toss data dump day, others assign properly day week. Yeah ""Allergies Covid"" shitty game. I've sinus issues past 7 days. pressure ears plugged. vaxed since April. Wife similar symptoms cleared couple days. Kids fine.... love song, music video great well. God damn. miss bird flu. simpler times  Lollapalooza happening right  Lol, Delta causes severe impacts kids? So, you’re literally making concerns point? Asking Delta causes kids grow 2 heads, causes rapture makes much sense asking harms kids. COVID impact kids meaningful way. year data fact. Unless get ACTUAL DATA indicating Delta somehow different, makes sense freak vaccinating children. fact, UK formally decided vaccinate children all, even vaccine approved. Despite knowing vaccine mostly safe, National Health Service believes risk negative outcome due COVID incredibly remote 12 age group makes sense give kids vaccine disease doesn’t effect them. confirm this. friend swore would never get vaxxed made appointment. delta scaring crap I’m glad stepped made right choice.  Facts McDonald's charge $5 fee anti maskers! think mandates passports inevitable point. easy say big intrusion (debatable), point people refusing vaccinate prohibiting us fully functional society. can't see many governments allowing go much longer. Aug 2 (Reuters) - Cases COVID-19, along hospitalizations deaths it, increased last week, U.S. officials said Monday, even vaccination rates grow amid concern highly contagious Delta variant.

People wear masks prevent spread coronavirus disease (COVID-19), highly transmissible Delta variant led surge infections, New York City, U.S., July 30, 2021. like feeling anonymous. Makes feel like people judging less nice cheap hangout place? That's last place I'd hang at. eat BigMac leave, look back next visit.  Wow could've seen coming? reasons sensible.

Similar timeline last year. releasing 1 patient every hour (they aren't), bad. sueing things true. They’ve studied found efficacy drops 6th month mark. view invalidated couple weeks.

...once get covid, get really sick almost die, lose family member, close friend, someone provides financial support...or die. think children vaccinated people care protect unvaccinated adults longer, nobody would care mask mandates. ""high"" ""substantial"" defined CDC average 50 cases per 100,000 per week.

Not ambiguous all. newspapers definitely covered change CDC guidance put front page hit threshold. I'd assume everywhere. Vaccinated people still get virus unvaccinated people everybody greenlit get vaccine. know hard imagine someone still caring someone else's safety give try. believe need compare contracted virus recovered contracted died sorting vaccinated not. Fair enough. counties imposed new mandates- I’d love nothing getting this. mask face, end day couldnt care less about, doesn’t feel safe anymore. Thats much better think, chance breakthrough infection already low, 50% drop long covid top super low chances. ""We can't rule humanity may die within next three days.""   even get physical card, digital copy. don’t think people follow next lockdown let alone 20 years haha. It’s Americans say it’s we’re borderline already. really sloppy article.

The headline says 99.999%, first paragraph says 99.99%. 10x difference.

I believe headline incorrect. Anyway, means:

* 0.01% fully vaccinated people breakthrough case
* 0.004% fully vaccinated people breakthrough case led hospitalization.

&amp;#x200B;

So according that, 40% COVID cases fully-vaccinated people lead hospitalization, ridiculous. believe 0.004% number, suspect percentage breakthrough cases **far far** higher 0.01%.

I trust numbers here. personally know 4 people breakthrough cases. think interesting little anti-vaxxers Spanish Portuguese speaking worlds. I've generally attributed high uptake high trust government works well Canada Northern Europe much higher US Eastern Europe. Latin America, Spain Portugal sort fit argument. Less 1% fully vaccinated people experience breakthrough Covid-19 infection, analysis finds----LOOK Wow. ones want vaccine US vaccinated least 1 shot? Putting goalposts previous high changes nothing exponential serious nature current predicament. Seems fair  Live life chose. same. People losing minds. absurd. It’s real wake call me. I’m convinced don’t even need states anymore. Abbott criminal felon. Assuring COVID sickness. different stabbing poisoning people. 

I may live TX, NEVER call Texan. state embarrassment. america 10x cases Olympics brings thousands together countries. allows virus novel opportunities jump shores.

the variants already also stories athletes, staff almost daily. imagine frustration event hosts.

and compare public minuscule? half country going keep providing access nice, full viral load. 

So I'm fully versed virology anything think true? Since virus haphazardly travels whole population think half country vaccinated means *whole* country experience less severe infections.   CDC memo gets leaked, revealing knew vaccinated could spread virus publicly admitted it

What actual transmission numbers vaccinated people? can't imagine high, even Delta. 

Virus needs establish foothold someone start replicating enough spread, point vaccine. They'll shut ice cream machine  Yep… still can’t smell Jack Daniels without wanting vomit, last time got sick 25 years ago. sucks. McDonalds nice cheap hangout place. good pandemic great normal times.  wish true am. work international healthcare organization. Masks required hospitals admin/business offices. masks required there. vaccine requirements anywhere. I’m Tx. Trying hard find another employer. Probably cheaper businesses enforce masking enforce social distancing. Social distancing usually means capacity limits therefore less revenue businesses.

Honestly, neither matter point. Delta super contagious unvaccinated breakthrough vaccinated people. regular cloth mask prevents 40-60% spread. Delta roughly twice transmissible original variant, masked person infected Delta likely spread COVID unmarked person Delta. (My reasoning may wrong here, feel free correct know otherwise). maybe double mask mandate (K)N95 mask mandate would slow spread, popular (even liberal pockets US).

The saving grace breakthrough infections still rare vaccinated people. still significant unvaccinated population, Delta destroying right now. want gold medal quitting first lap race.  freedom variant Gaetz /s   one people holding Novavax due fear adverse reaction higher efficacy NVax, can't wait anymore. Getting shot week.   homeschool again. worth mess. emailed superintendent asking plan covid crickets. byeeeee. Jbe spent last 17 months exhausted state. feel pain.

No one wears masks takes seriously. way. least get warrant judge police enter home.

It means nothing towards fairing better pandemic data analyst feels like misrepresentation data. 

That said get vaccinated people!  Oh, man. like this. Use money subsidize COVID care US, folks basically collectively insuring themselves. Fair enough. Reading vs interpreting intention nuance lost most. respect disregard opinion skim. Overall, seem like thoughtful person. I'd imagine experience Reddit quite different most, largely skim taking crap. 

Do thing. Cool. Wanna compare last summer? flu?

Stats mean nothing vacuum. many vaccinated people died covid? I'll wait funny Republican acting like total imbecile makes us sit ask why?

Wearing mask staying two meters away people relative normalcy. Also, what's end game? contain outbreak masks rest lives? think option unvaxed literally dying fairer everyone. made choice. Adults actually good number use. like eligible population both. 100% vaccinated Americans directly hit lighting dead. desperately needed school last year. 

Now, South facing wave cases like nothing US faced yet, South facing Delta strain might actually endanger children, South starts school week. It’s going shit show. Israel testing little differently United States comes healthcare workers. They’re screened often without symptoms. So, CDC memo gets leaked, revealing knew vaccinated could spread virus publicly admitted it, facing complete return 2020 unless take drastic mitigation efforts.

This isn’t really happened. best tell CDC someone alarmist make presentation worst possible spin everything…which good, public health agency remiss don’t someone that.

When various spokespeople pressed it, said wasn’t official position CDC. supposed say? hope workplace, isn’t constantly jumping *most* pessimistic option.

There concerning data, incident Massachusetts especially concerning, CDC asking additional caution everybody gave guidelines so. parents work basically requesting go back masks while, fine.

What else Fauci supposed say? masking whatnot well good, much less effective getting vaccinated, *far* potent weapon spread virus. get full vaccination it’s pretty much over.

Of course dark days ahead. There’s nothing now, since set based choices people made month ago. Go on... Look Jonas Salk  much wrong everything said. I'd interested denominator calculations. 20% people got breakthrough infections sufficient require testing long covid? Sure. that's breakthrough infections, exposed get infected all. never said vaccines make masks less effective.

My point still get vaccines *significantly* effective masks are. exact numbers, know, thought made clear.

So, mask? Good got vax. Vax? Great still great despite fear mon gering. Vax mask? mean sure probably little effective, buuuuut

Remember cases first went stratosphere? Like around November? People still wearing masks stores going home big unmasked gatherings, wondering got covid.

Regardless many people won’t get second shots. goal posts preventing hospitalizations severe illness entire spread COVID even vaccinated people, means go decades, right? pretty much endemic. 

Scientists saying vaccinated people even avoid vaccinated people though we’re back square one. time things seem better new variant emerge sending shockwaves foresee way life indefinite lifetimes. mean - nothing forever - forever living lives slight upticks vaccinations brushed weeks/months likely people celebrating now. irony misunderstanding exponential curve viral spread. Percentages mean significantly actual number infected case. Uh got vaccinated graduated college 20 years ago. I’m terrified school following suit this. want least partial college experience, damnit. Lauging doesnt work anymore He's wrong contrarian. find definition 'adults' here.  Anyone know n95 airline approved?  suppose clarified meant drivers season. Seb pretty mouthy Ferrari he's calmed lot since joining AM. Aside Kimi, Alonso, lewis, think anyone grid racing 2007. (Seb 2007.5 iirc) sure. cases vaccinated naturally infected getting covid again. Albeit instances think rare. rare previously thought. intents purposes got 80% immunity, covid would likely round clock coverage. Covid ever completely go away, vaccinated close guarantee hospitalized die one get. lambda cases total found U.S.  ""why can't agree want get virus"" continued.  benjamins Ron DeSantis go get apology???  barely even could called lockdowns last year. we're likely see year patchwork vaccine mask mandates, depending area, regardless bad gets. Corporate America probably answer here. goes Biden Admin actions well GOP. Lock downs restrictions disruptions good bottom line $$$  Well agree strain bypasses vaccine royally screwed point think either vaxxed unvaxxed people would ready accepting new reality. time virus disease never ending covid eventually burn out. vaxx hold happens. them? can’t right.

Republicans sociopaths. Dead people need reliable power, either, unvaxxed goobers rubes supporters governor's party. Oops. Sorry, got kids. I’m getting killed. Retired Kaiser doc here. nothing new, least Southern California worked. annual flu vaccine mandated Kaiser health care workers going back ten years so. *you're Ignorant people working critical occupations. Organizations hire retain subject malpractice suits.

The Bill Rights Constitution give personal freedom endanger others. giant babies. Truly embarrassing. ""Our bodies familiarity virus. mutated virus likely disastrous outcome.""

Don't even need read rest. right tells real understanding viruses work. Exactly. don’t want perceived regret it, there’s definitely people do. Probably without Vaccine would horrible time ahead, correct. times living gonna end getting Covid, Vaccine help ” devastating disease vaccinated folks.”

Thats good question, could Oh, no, speeding steps listen half-cobbled-together arguments generally boil ignorant statements. I've done dance many times last year's easy see choreography.

So, speeding further, take care hope actually educate eventually. COVID always mostly hurt old underlying conditions. 

Most us rejected argument belittle danger seriousness situation. us still consider old Americans underlying conditions people. Don’t give ideas Yes, know lot 70 years ago. 

We best vaccines ever made terms side effects (the mRNA vaccines). 
They developed rapidly vaccine. 
They deployed rapidly vaccine.

We eliminated smallpox past 70 years. 
We made polio issue Americans longer think about.

And yet, progress, people doubt group people made progress possible. know buy BTC. GRT. 'll tell cuz wont. 
 
The reson buy wont understand think invest money Kaiser insurance cost $700 today didnt test kids thus might infect relatives int eh coming weeks. really cant =event start broski. ever buy crypto. boot lick dollar buy corporate bonds. Enron looking good. I’m it. I’m vaccinated still wear mask.  messed up. Forget maskholes, people straight assholes. Yea wished didn’t drop mask mandate indoors. I’m fully vaccinated it’s pretty much unfair now. I’m mad though Makes wonder 30% upset sucks. stores might afraid piss customers, might go lax store response - shitty excuse - one reason government mask mandate help protect businesses imo. Takes competition guess work it, applies everyone. couple! gonna senior, took year work remotely travel abroad instead going back school quarantine. gonna let take year away us Currents without accounting booster shots something like

The best time plant tree ten years ago. second best time now.

I agree, good philosophy unvaxxed adopt point. Must nice governor places health well citizenry ahead politics. part get confused didn’t first variants killed 500k people US scare crap them? Explain care people? 12s immunocompromised sympathy, dumbass adults decided skip vaccine loss society. I'm aware. clubs bars requiring proof vaccination entry. could potentially skew sample much higher percentage vaccinated. original point (see comment 2 one replied to) -- possible outlier event representative general population. Honestly secrets aren’t possible. much jealousy people ever caught wind would rat out. It’s sick system. know lot people identify nurses really LPNs STNAs - hard work sure definitely education RN. 

Then again, hospital work released best estimated vaccination rates reported 71% physicians (and 52% staff overall) vaccinated. Shockingly low really disappointing. great news. Sure wish parents would get vaccinated. Wish employer would require vaccination. require masks also require vaccination…. work hospital… friend nurse antivax confuses frustrates much. lose sleep think talk issue them. curious ask sources, don’t want go path Everyone blaming CDC lifting mask mandates early. Matter fact, people like blame US ton procedure/guidelines country facing wrath delta variants. comments, including one originally replied to, biggest issue is, means replies pointless. feel bad. Using adult population sleezy way make data look better actually is. CDC tracking non-hospitalized breakthrough infections, states studies are. obviously still undercounting them, though, vaccinated people sniffles always going go get tested. Mutation happens random, far greater unvaccinated getting infected, therefore risk mutation far greater them, yes come anywhere Kaiser got shots Sharp 🤷🏼‍♀️ fully vaccinated mid April year appointments 30 minutes moment left car moment got back it, 15 post-shot wait time included. headline meaningless without taking community prevalence COVID-19 cases account.

“Unvaccinated ISS astronauts 0% hospitalization rate COVID-19!”

You fight misinformation giving people accurate information, contextualized extra details need understand it. Trust people smart enough handle full truth. Oversimplifications, exaggerations white lies never defensible. Try learn ""employment will"" works. quit fire reasons exceptions. need provide reason, perhaps stupidity ground. Ever job life? 

There already lawsuit Houston hospital workers, thrown court. can't wait sue... Employment right. nurses know pro vaccine know ton them. Covid tide. live age fucking internet. Folks Texas love God Country get vaccine shot.

I cancel conference week Dallas (AAHOA) cases spiking wedding Houston shit ton positive cases coming it. one become ""immune,"" covid (this logical train illogical thought)?

:/ Hoping things return 2019 next year honestly Really? state in? remember reading beginning pandemic don’t develop long term immunity human coronavirus, studies common cold human coronavirus showed 4-6 month resistance re-infection common.

Pfizer, company made popular vaccine, stated antibodies waning 6 months, people need third dose.

Why ignoring company MADE vaccine, known precedent human coronavirus study?

It’s time provide boosters everyone ASAP. logic literally different. ""Well, people violent outburst, might well whatever want us to, unless commit crimes again."" brother nurse (in handful hospitals works at, least) he’s opposite experience.

He says nurses pro-vaxxers, doctors ones living denial. marginal higher efficiency Novavax meaningless compared months months vaccine, efficiency 0%. Good move get shot week. [Counties voted trump far lower vaccinated rates Biden rates percent difference grew April  Texas peak? may end well. ....but could find any

The protesters shoved journalist bike kept kicking lay ground. taken hospital. reported new outlets Germany. Yet somehow say see it. Funny that. really

The US could easily 75% total population vaccinated witth vaccination capacity. 70% **of adult population** way country at. Truth. Go CVS. Ralph. Wallgreens. Wallmart. ETC. 

I tried get kids tested kaiser took 3 hours. closed get tested. seen store near you. Finally U.S little faster! guess matter days Brazil pass U.S first dose.

Brazil 67% adult population first dose. long? Hoping within year get back 2019 honestly. need research that. see around breakthrough cases appear way common ….  Yeah, issues Mar 2021 getting vaccinated KP. wasn’t ill-will malfeasance. KP rolled vaccination registration system pretty quickly really abysmal, least first. 

Your anecdotal, single data point proves nothing. know nothing Jon Snow… Jesus Christ I’m nurse, can’t answer that. I’m also baffled. say anecdotally, nurses know colleagues I’ve worked with, know two nurses adamantly vaccinating. One touts experience nurse spread disinformation isn’t actually working doesn’t plan to, one “quit” medical community corrupt pushing dangerous vaccines. Good riddance them.
The rest nurse friends vaccinated vocal advocates masking vaccination. soon nurses won’t choice. noted Alberta going well far beyond single region worldwide done (to best knowledge). We're talking opening economy, weeks ago already; they're completely shutting public testing tracing, ""recommending"" isolation symptoms.

At time, every health region positive case growth firmly fourth wave. 1.7m people province unvaccinated, many children yet eligible. 

This vile, cruel unconscionable human experiment leave many dead thousands crippled. Quick refresher:

Delta likely show symptoms date range exposure?

How quickly exposure considered ""contagious""?

I read multiple times weekend, can't seem find need need (family member exposed confirmed positive.)

I'm sorry ask. spend lot researching this...but honestly numbers run together trying piece together risk analysis. *catches COVID*
“It appears even natural selection kowtowing PC woke police.” relieved Democratic governor Covid. much higher survival rate? also taking account amount people caught it, symptoms, get checked? wonderful news.  Tf?  it? fight misinformation opinion? 

The stat wrong right? Political ideology much bigger issue, comment black people. Black people factually lower vaccination rates. talked friend finally getting vaccinated. insisted KP first, ended appointment Walgreen's. Talk good timing. People willing sacrifice rights temporary sense security, terrifying. know disconnect happening. client today tell wave town worse last one. Almost every patient admitted ending ventilator. tell anxiety bad youngest child one family vaccinated, says vaccinate him. Ma'am, I've already vaccinated kid we're fine. bother ask anything tell that's backed study convince to. NICU RN.  work's reinstated masks indoors antivaxxers/maskers going bonkers. get mutations come unvaccinated people? Maybe does, it’s also likely it’s coming vaccinated people create new variant susceptible to.... immunocompromised folks now, never got freedoms back, seeming like never will.  ridiculous. Everybody opportunity get vaccine. Unvaccinated people ones risk made decision get vaccinated, people get vaccinated still punished? Unfathomably stupid Nursing education practical/vocational nature. lot critical thinking skills taught. Even average college graduate fully understand statistics risk. educate infectious disease specialists reason, seems like look guidance arena. death rate COVID line Where's line exactly?

The covid vaccine. greater good without lying them, gives anti-vaxxers ammunition. nothing it, clearly  CDC fucked telling fully vaxed people could take mask off. honor system total failure another mandate introduced won’t near much buy in.

I get did, try push people get shot backfired. Wow, that's profoundly Anti American. Would also okay ICE enter home without warrant check illegal immigrants? Would okay local police pop check marijuana? Would okay DHS check ""terrorists""? Everyone natural selector natural selection walks room.  Republican, majority are. I'm you. vaccines great. anybody get vaccinated selfish moron. 

But need lie efficacy, either. greatness stands own, truthfully. lying give easy fodder stupid anti-vaxxers. CDC numbers fully vaccinated regardless age. Total population vaxxed. hit 70% today population least one shot.... Yeah I’m super generous. 3/4 unvaccinated ratio doesn’t look good don’t want keep beating “we told so.”We huge uptick vaccination weekend like 800k shots, maybe people starting pay attention. said true thing ignored point completely can't force vaccinate ... ask nicely provide proof. can't, fired. like plenty places drugs test policies. 

Sure ask medical history. ever job life. know form fill health insurance. ask plenty medical questions. smoker on. want bear increase cost insurance idiots. 

You never job life? I'm 24 never even speeding ticket. problem this. Piss protect many. That's cream soda me, exorcist barfed never touched ever noticed lot people seem think know jobs know absolutely nothing about?

People critical waiters, think construction workers lazy, think stock brokers crooks, think mechanics trying rip off. 

Nurses find doctors condescending they’re attracted notions doctors don’t know they’re talking about. Yep, intentional misinformation made conspiracy theorists skeptics even distrusting. really need transparent. understand direction changing novel virus, we’re constantly learning new things token they’ve withheld info.  trend far consistent coincidence. Democrat states high amount black people generally better Republicans states, including fewer black people. One shot J&amp;J probably worse 1 shot Moderna Pfizer tho Please tell felon 18? actually see anything wrong this? Pretty much thing FL. Total garbage leadership. DC, Guam, Puerto Rico, American Samoa Virgin Islands would like word behind gym. worst states list didn’t provide data. FL, AL, MO, GA, etc. No, no, definitely not. I'm sure must whatever delusional thing came started last week Donald's term, since sure would willing collude Biden make look like fuckup. smart say ""infected"" says ""deadly"".. know people gotten covid twice, vaccinated after. said second time got covid nearly bad first. fully vaxxed since may 3rd! heck yeah give booster shot! like last time McD's mask mandate comply local law, still enforce it. 100% expect McD's employees wear mask correctly. obsessed airinum.com bought everyone family first wave (complete success). Pricey, reusable. filter lasts 100 hours. give valve caps, places can’t vent. 

I use regular cloth masks casual outdoor stuff like walking dog.

Good luck! Hate you. 

How many semesters have? 

Hoping least sneak one normal one graduation It'll look like he's bandwagoning  American. I'm tired millions fellow countrymen breaking rules contributing pandemic. ""The ratio percentage whites vaccinated percentage Blacks favors Whites, however ratio become less skewed towards Whites Biden's presidency.""

See? words too. Possibly. zero reaction either dose. I’m guessing exposed point past asymptomatic.  Thank you, really appreciate responses taking time help educate me. We're 70% eligible (under 12 counted). loooong way go toward 70% total population. COVID never political begin with, fact we're giving pat back truthful vaccines really shown standards set. West coast? entire Southwest. Lake Mead Lake Powell low since started filling decades ago. What?! Why?  hard get vaccine exemption IU (if apply, almost guaranteed get one), 7 8 students suing school already received religious exemption. means whole lawsuit due fact 8 students feel like wearing mask getting tested weekly basis. can't think dumber selfish reason sue university. least set precedent mandates across county though. vaccination rates Southern Missouri absolutely abysmal though. counties still around 35% year olds fully vaccinated. Even Florida better shape surprisingly Well helped. Thanks time. one? I'm thinking we'd followed plan George W. Bush put place this. like vote guy, apparently downright prescient drive ensure national plan pandemic. 

www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/social-distancing-coronavirus.amp.html 

There articles this, too, Google ""pandemic plan george w bush lockdown"".

The key lockdown coordinated way, nation-wide, early two weeks. Realistically, once. something like per wave. 

And 100% lockdown, one leaves homes; thorough sense coordinated national borders, folks can't go eat restaurant one state resent losing ""their freedoms"". schools close once, restaurants, etc., everyone stays home - essential workers work. whole nation gets close two-week quarantine can, relax cases start escalate again. maybe use masks, limited social distancing slow lockdowns fewer them. see nothing wrong that? Please tell American. According super-recent english study: Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 93% effective alpha variant 88% effective Delta variant preventing symptomatic COVID infections. hospitalization, symptomatic infection period.

Seems pretty good me. Lol, you’re jackass doesn’t even speak comprehensible English. hope you’re right- I’m reading articles experts saying permanent. left study June. mess. called inform told site coordinator sighed agreed. Sounds like frustrating process partiicpants. need 85% delta that's counting kids.. factor antibodies already covid recently, maybe closer. Yeah infants definitely get antibodies etc mom pregnant. That’s pregnant people get TDap certain number weeks pregnant baby gets protection it. 
But also get good stuff breast milk long drink Lol, ok! Realistically, vaccine less effective preventing symptoms delta (80ish% iirc) we're going see outbreaks like happen (especially packed, indoor settings). mean vaccine protect serious illness. family unvaxxed immunocompromised id careful sake vaccines protect worst outcomes overwhelming majority cases Yeah that's figured, wanted check! Interesting though, I'd assume would somewhere would tracked. Yes, studies getting editors snd review process garbage. Cope hear time people, “oh friends nurse said get vaccine!” Vaccine gives 80% protection positivity (symptomatic asymptomatic) Delta variant, least several months since jab. 

While 80% 100%, number want throw away reason. Besides, mutual protection among vaccinated individuals higher. Let's assume friend surely exposed Covid, point he'd surely positive vaccinated. 20% chance positive (not 100%) I'm him, 80% less risk become positive he's positive. 

100% * .2 * .2 = 4%, risk positive due contact friend. 

Vaccines strongly diminish transmission, even Delta. Mutual contacts among vaccinated individuals safer. Besides, nobody forbids mask even vaccinated, thing I'm btw. can’t go back normal? Kids wear masks, shouldn’t change live choose get vaxxed stay healthy. Yes. think government agents able come home without warrant? Wait. prove planning meeting 18 months said elsewhere, number people didn’t get second shot likely statistically insignificant.  think that's coincidence, true. Yeah realized LOL bad. Thanks! Haha, oh man.. see, thing is, well, that... I'm gonna take shot. knowwww, knowww UGHHHHHH.. I'M SORRYYY. I'm ever, ever, ever gonna take shot. ;) really small big picture though, look international arrivals daily LAX quarantine requirements whatsoever. globally connected world, people going adapt living variants. Can't worry something control over. Exactly. read like 85 90% fully vaxxed required. even 70% (one shot) nearly close enough. factor 10 20% breakthrough cases plus waning antibodies early vaccines gotten months ago, probably functionally 40% + vaxxed. Hot butter Delta new variants oven already speak. need aggressive approach. 😣 need falsify anything test would delusional? US pumpt much politics virus yes, things like happen happend outside us.. Anyway, explain steep drop? vaccines, right? Oh god I'm stupid right, Google Mayo Clinic %'s based whole US population, adults. 


I'm dumb LMAO. suck trump, I'm seriously losers. Ah yes, Idaho Wyoming. Well known hubs black hispanic people. want government agents able come house without warrant? rate US low?

In province Canada we’re sitting 83% 12+ vaccinated least one dose. Wtf? think pretty much what's happening, unvax people new vulnerable. family got COVID due irresponsible family reunion us against. us got sick, even vulnerable, vax, didn't. mom instance got son chills, felt tired it. one jab I'm waiting get worse, I've mild far. think vax works, even one dose some, better get jabs. Thanks!  Assuming meant colleges/universities (since that's person talking about) really nowhere near that. states may represent numbers state population represent university population. Delta. I’m healthy fully vaxxed really don’t want quarantine want Novavax really effective workhorse world come september, developed countries chance vaccines. 

Mainly Novavax partly going made Canada, Canada needs win one talking going hiking fairly popular trail people walk past get tell that. also said want son die. risk management absolute shit. could kidnap force would. Nurses 4 year degree (LPN’s 2), aren’t really better educated average college grad. 

NP’s, PA’s, Snd others masters higher level education specific trading scientific process critical thinking skills. 

Some nursing schools aren’t rigorous, churn tech/assist-level workers. Hard pass 🤣 mean sense 666 ""sign devil"" thing. article content states 66.6%. headline rounds 67%, I'm fine rounding, care rounding. I'm saying 66.6666% means 2/3. happens someone survey small sample size, say nine counties six affected... report 66.6%. usually means sample size insufficient. safe what? know - varies pathogen pathogen, think safe number would 90-95 percent eligible population. Keep mind many eligible, right includes children 12. need adults step virus became political tool divided nation.

If 90% vaccinated, variants would struggle thrive population. 95% would almost impossible variant take hold. numbers hard hit either. enough resources...but sadly politicians sides ruined using political weapon

It sad... Pandemics killed many millions throughout history first time ever - massive campaign global cooperation, ability defeat it, can't many choose simply it. endless cycle something breaks it. chance unite one people planet, failed. question, too. know scientists get studies reviewed published live alone alone year covid. like prison sentence. soon vaccine available got it. wear mask needed. Get back business usual stop scared. threat inconvenience. doubt businesses avoid liability mandate vaccinations masks not, lots limitations much slower service unvaccinated. causing outbreak drag bottom line, H&amp;S gets busted playbook. 

Do want fight legion lawyers outspend 10x? also lot different types nurses. require much schooling others. long term trials done yet. Check Pfizer site exactly retail employees quitting droves. quickly edited clarify. Can't vaccinate youngest yet. Schools start week here. 

Very nervy stop fake virus already - tx officials hospital admin. interesting trend noticed lack smell/taste thing something vary age/health much typical “sickness” symptoms do. 

I couple friends *very* athletic. I’m talking D1 athletes and/or least star athletes sick. Although, felt sick like week, senses smell/taste severely compromised 4-6 months. 

On side note, it’s worth mentioning end tunnel, numerous factors determine severe COVID hits ranging viral load amounts type variant currently dominant. lost nearly 9 lbs us Americaners ill. skinny (and healthy!) frame going illness, that's shocking amount weight lose professional athlete like that. Children get flu vaccine buddy Seems similar France doing.  Get vaccine come public!

And actually china something similar since day 1 except vaccine part. 
They color coded system WeChat must scanned go 100% everywhere. yellow red, getting in. Yeah, people makes posts making fun fat women made account post (and probably person). making straw-man lefties that's argue against. 

People right incapable arguing good faith. Well done, guys, congrats !🤗  case like wondering like 30% 100 people.

""showed 1,883 hospitalized COVID patients, 432 Sunday’s total. That’s increase 29.8% one day.

The total highest since Feb. 1, downward trend winter surge virus, vaccines first distributed. pandemic record 3,084 inpatients set Jan. 11.

The new total 11.3 times low set June 20 166 hospitalized COVID patients 75% higher one week ago."" Thanks. appreciate you. anti league frustrating.

I already sure. older kids adults online school years turned fine. two youngest rather precocious, already long since college level everything started online like could turn illiterate. older siblings closer mainstream. online students prefer format (they're digital natives). socialize online night day, always have. They'll fine. Mind blowing people believe bullshit interesting case, J&amp;J apparently less effective Delta variants, prior infection boosted immune response vaccine massively.

If may ask, react J&amp;J vaccine? Fever shivering? Cold sweats perhaps? I’m guessing study shows booster needs least extra amount time (ten full weeks) generate enough antibodies pass onto baby? matter vaccine received, long 30 weeks? I’d interesting reading study referenced… 70% adults, total US population. Last summer dealing alpha variant, contagious one, since delta spreads much effectively, vaccination rate needs higher account increased speed spread. reason spread still bad even hit 50% mark full vaccinations, means another 165 million people still fully vaccinated. doesn't. selects ability get laid. That's Texas’ priorities complaining trans teens health care education. don’t know right subreddit need advice. I’m M17 fully vaccinated asthma. getting vaccine mom would allow go anywhere, literally locked house. 

When got vaccine let go gym able spend 1-4 hours vaccinated friends only. 

Now cases rising due new virus, letting go see vaccinated friends soon pull gym. worried? impact kids delta resulting increase hospitalization horrifying time schools going person new semester. even lot peer reviewed studies child cases long haul COVID. 3 studies could find small sample sizes, one said 6% chance, another said 42% another said 50%. Freal? 500 dead. 4200 MIS-C, 37 addition died. hey cares that, children literally die without classroom full diseased peers. card serial number batch vaccines written down, stickered in. Consider this: many states, including one teach in, it’s illegal strike teacher. It’s might lose job, it’s lose job license. Better late never  Exactly. case would extremely matter! Yeah actually believe reported data. Brilliant! China would never lie rest world political monetary gain. world talking about? Start C? Science care. varies state. describes risk reduction. vaccine 90% efficacy means vaccinated person 90% less chance severe illness, death, etc someone without vaccine. calculated placebo study comparing number infections study group number placebo group. remember right, Pfizer study saw 162 infections placebo group, 8 infections study group, total number infections groups 170. [1 - ( 8÷170)] x 100 = 95% efficacy. numbers might slightly since went memory, look exact data used. Honestly hell yes! good! 300 million doses mRNA vaccines given far vs, 20,000 Novavax clinical trial. unknown rare adverse reactions going happen, would Novavax mRNA vaccines. Damn thought lot, I’m probably somewhere 500-700 people - Chicken Pox

- Mumps

- Influenza

- HPV

- Hepatitis B

- Tetanus

- Polio

- Small Pox

- Literally every vaccine less 100% efficacy. I’m sure percentage missing herd immunity, one thing note 10 % Americans 33 mio people. level 100,000 cases day, would take 330 days burn that. Infections slow path herd immunity unless really let run wild like 400,000 cases day. Probably 🤣 remember correctly. Really sorry hear this. luckily get COVID (at least think) already vaccinated. But... panic disorder years. know was, got response doctors. really wonder something covid flips flight-or-flight response even gone. Like one long trigger.

Your symptoms sound lot body intense anxiety episodes. trying belittle all. interesting read lot testimonials long covid think ""that exactly went panic disorder"". Homophobia bad even directed people agree with. two optimum number you’re wearing crappy cloth masks I've saying schools go remote weeks opening. 

A large number kids already testing positive, hospitalized, even they're school. What's kids? That's main problem wanting shut unvaccinated life, vaccine kids yet.

Once immunocompromised, would enough respirators go around would assume Yeah that’s dystopian /s Colleges problem online classes, last day get refund passed.

Not colleges care enough cases, even vaccinated, raise concern somewhere.

If choose require vaccination (as should, care students), going massive outbreaks. 

People really underestimating much vaccines slow spread. (No, new CDC data *not* mean vaccinated unvaccinated people spread covid rate). fact chances getting shot high exactly comforting. believe vaccine. getting it. would happen? That’s fair point, [this suggests around 1% reported breakthrough cases fatal, which, accurate, would similar baseline fatality rate. think numbers still important, since odds vaccinated person dying covid depends actually getting breakthrough case, *then* one unlucky 1%.

It’s interesting though, early told vaccine drastically reduces severity get it. may still true, percentage breakthrough hospitalizations/deaths higher expected. delta variant might also something that. That's going fine medical debt many families. Sure hope avoiding free vaccine worth it. data pretty doubtful, implies 2000 breakthrough cases happened. 300 single county last week. WORLDSTAAAAAAAAAR!

I dunno, maybe.  Article posted yesterday said unvaccinated members ethnic minorities tended ""maybe might get one later"" camp, white rural unvaccinated tended ""never ever"" camp. wait, conservatives going use 'prove' vaccines work, assuming already. Holy shit get grip. You’re going die. kids aren’t going die. point honestly kids run higher risk dying school shooting. 

Believe vaccines believe science. Announce ""Friday"". support it, farther people apart announced, less chance fight it. one store actually anything enforce it. ""Lambda potential threat human society.""

What incredibly vague statement. damn Sasquatch everyone gets second chance get vaccine. fact, 4 million people didn’t. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""vaccines work safe"" pinned post read anything makes think Delta changes math point. matter new info comes there’s always subset wants downplay. It’s like reverse moving goalposts. clear, ""breakthrough survival rate"" implies someone tests positive vaccinated die.  99.999% number vaccinated people - vast majority tested positive COVID.  come COVID breakthrough case, chances dying much, much lower unvaccinated, much higher .001%. Per CDC, 6587 breakthrough deaths US. 99.999% survival rate, would need 657million breakthrough cases US. Some, all. I’ve heard wake outbreak every venue gets decide want check not, require masks not, etc Turn life threatening illness bad cold couple shots. Lady Moderna That’s specious reasoning, Dad. 1% huge difference terms population. Paul McCartney, cool. up-voted think adding conversation, also think adding ""I &lt;did good necessarily fear, setting good example. in, someone may want examine situation analytically / critically, want encourage others take actions current best practice. 

I know I've added things bottom posts, motivation fear censure fear bad influence - reasoning used excuse engage harmful behavior. remember reading ADA paper flu vaccines diabetes. gaming nurse friend, dunno accurate, explained character 30% weakness poison damage. Vaccine reduces poison damage 80%. Depending bad poison Damage-over-time affects character, affected character get damage time healthy person. 

I remember MMO games raid bosses DOT wrecks parties far one big hit. Well that's really nice, mandatory masking banned Florida, daily cases approaching record levels, pediatric hospitals beyond capacity school starts.

So maybe time grow balls federal level, use quarantine rights DHS start mandating actions make schools safe.

Until then, goddamn chance I'm sending kids guaranteed COVID infection spread family. dumbest thing ever too. 

Let's roll back time pandemic, like summer 2019 something. Take anti-maskers today ask ""Would wear face mask public places pandemic going on?"" Almost would said yes.

But actually happened, people *extremely strong opinions it*. like crisis happened said ""Well someone dumbass situation, guess that's me"" immediately adopted stupidest mindset even though something never really cared before. 

Blows mind  Mine every time woke up, bad morning later evening far symptomatic breakthrough cases.

Well would almost be.. getting tested. virus won’t killed off, killed mean eradicated. circulates animals impossible. reason, mask mandates mitigations seem ineffectual me. solution vaccination. still, even fully vaccinated 60%(or even less) Delta

From article, 3% people unvaccinated; made ~25% cases. corresponds vaccine efficacy infection 85%. 60%. CDC estimates efficacy infection 75-85%.

For efficacy infection, everyone vaccinated, would herd immunity threshold, don’t hear anyone else, right thing. I’m proud you. Blocked anti-vaxxer unvaccinated people ruining vaccinated people. US PPACA, charge smokers age. 2 things allowed. Best luck that. Mask mandates lockdowns athletes. asked put lives training hold indefinitely. wear mask grocery stores similar locations, I’m going go back taking another year training fully vaccinated individual. realize sports completely incompatible masks distancing like MMA, BJJ, etc. I’m ready capitulate entire sports disciplines get canceled time people deem COVID “over”. literally issue masks nobody seems realize, masks minor inconvenience means gym closes again. considering getting first shot today would go one done. almost time. agree. annoying way presented, like vaccinated get COVID, everything fine. really hope vaccine reduces serious illness delta reduces likelihood getting it, know yet.... much sucks, right thing do. Colleges problem online classes, last day get refund passed.

If enough cases, even vaccinated, raise concern somewhere. Hey good him! He’s said done lot shitbag things prominent Republican coming favor vaccinated good thing. get Superintendent listen posted masks "" optional"" many cases (and symptomatic ones) begin with.

Where live, vaccination campaign going somewhat well - mostly hampered lack vaccines rather people wanting - results already visible. New daily cases increasing since early July number hospitalizations deaths, despite increasing well (obviously), MUCH slower rate previous waves, never going high before. week, number new daily covid cases already shown signs decreasing, meaning wave peaked around last week, going initial predictions media claiming would peak near end August. Even I, consider somewhat optimistic pandemic management vaccines, bit surprised cases starting drop soon. false sense security people terrifying me. US, Europe hundreds thousands vaccines expiring every week. Mississippi 46.5 % positivity rate. Pretty wild. going world record something? Imagine slope cases curve properly forget people companies. Death threat? WTH? People seriously losing it.  600,000 people perished USA due COVID-19. That’s lot people, even survival rate high.  just... make corporations organizations dirty work. single federal mandate could end immediately. Instead, we're miserable race praying enough companies cover country.   Higher transmission Delta means % required herd immunity higher too. said, I'd expect US cases come pretty soon, based international trends cold. Delta different R(0) wildtype.

Delta different neutralizing antibody response wildtype.

P values tell probability certain observation would happen chance. first statement p&lt;10^-10 . scientifically accurate. Venues actually checking vax status? Never believe politician says something ""temporary"" That's virologists epidemiologists (or CDC, WHO, PHE, major public health body) define terms. going keep pretending Long Covid thing? we've still given almost information vaccinated dealing Long Covid. debunk all. people got covid vaccinated? Yes. enough us know coronavirus replicate vaccinated people. course, there's fewer people among vaccinated(or people covid) whose bodies would allow virus live long get chance mutation unvaccinated.

But still, even fully vaccinated 60%(or even less) Delta. even magically people Earth become vaccinated flash, virus still mutate point rendering vaccine efforts useless.

I'm saying point thing blame virus. vaccinate keep health check there's nothing else do. Even everyone around vaccinated. might well require social distancing limit indoor capacity they're it. Can't safe. know- feel like sinus infection! thing lean get super headache... thats symptom typically (is normal?) chances happening vaccinated exceedingly slim much point Why? Masks sacrifice work. looks pretty jacked photo 79 year old guy! Sir Paul!! CMU alum, assure hygiene dear alma mater also highly questionable. 😂 need talk better masking. need talk N-95 respirators

Well, time. Better year half late never guess. going mask, may well something works cheap single layer cloth favorite football team logo bought gas station. understand frustration behind sentiment even agreed worst times. 

The problem they've died, virus mutated fast vaccines would never even chance catch up. 

That's one issue. can't get vaccinated totally innocent? Children? people legitimate medical conditions keeping getting vaccinated?

Then there's logistics. many truck drivers, sanitation workers, farmers, doctors, plumbers, construction workers, mechanics, factory workers, bakers, etc. died? many innocent people die direct result deaths? 

I mean... Christ... get it. easier believe there's nothing going everything fine hoax way overblown... things much worse been, assholes playing people's lives can't get goddamn pride whatever. 

It sucks, basically. 12 can. Additionally, seen evidence children driving current spike cases. 

There valid excuse get vaccinated overwhelming majority people. culture war, people punishing thinking really sticking liberals. Sorry plans work out. hope worst inconvenienced ends. read article. It’s percentage based millions cases. much money lost major social distancing period last year going see anywhere shut again

Especially colleges lawsuits people wanted partially refunded losing in-person classes China gave world playbook consistently end pandemic month. Severe harsh lockdown test everybody, open up. Zero covid virus remains

If there’s flare up, lock region weeks severely, test everyone, reopen. Zero covid virus remains.

It’s brilliantly simple west could execute thing. need whatever 2019

So basically condemn everyone like social isolation indefinitely. one saying kids going home taught forever, FDA already working approval 12. people like me, end sight now.

And think 200 different forms primary immune deficiency diseases (PIDDs) affecting approximately 500,000 people United States.

You talking doubling death rate even people die reasons, insignificant amount people immune deficient.  four weeks? What's driving that? Nothing's changed. concerned, maintain 1-2m distance. chances transmission outdoors extremely low. Delta may may increased viral load (CDC operating assumption does), may increase risk low baseline still highly unlikely happen. countries world never outdoor masking. Large events. Lambda variant coronavirus, first identified Peru spreading South America, highly infectious resistant vaccines original version virus emerged Wuhan, China, Japanese researchers found. Although clear yet whether variant dangerous Delta threatening populations many countries, senior researcher Kei Sato University Tokyo believes ""Lambda potential threat human society."" People queue receive dose Pfizer BioNTech vaccine Central Middlesex Hospital London, Britain, August 1, 2021. seen studies indicating outdoor interactions significant source transmission delta. Undoubtedly occur occasion, expect rate enough warrant inconvenience political cost. I'm skipping kindergarten 5 year old keeping home. spent multiple times children's RSV there's way I'm messing around covid (or rsv going around now....). figure we'll spend year reading books likely better education anyways... Feels like mandate tide really turned, enough enough! Bummer him. American South worst current outbreak COVID entire world.

If lived South unvaccinated I'd shitting brick right now. Unfortunately, seem care mind boggling.  wonder point worth would early develop cold test. Obviously pcr similar techniques would taken similar time process time didn’t much testing Yeah got pretty accurately, unemployment rates incredibly high. comparison European countries Spain taxes people companies freaking much regulations paperwork start business complete pain ass, due companies actually leaving country, company work with. leads Spanish government less money fund healthcare social security.

Luckily worked Madrid local government little benevolent us. Quite shame ask considering Spanish folks met incredibly hardworking. 

Now I'm living Australia Idk impression even seems healthcare system get inefficient every year passes by. Baffles people still getting first shot.  rules excessive work. Lockdowns parts country successful. NSW hot mess due poor leadership governance liberal (right, conservative leaning) party.

The ADF used lockdowns Victoria last year, dramas. lockdown finished troops stood down. one school taking anything away you, people need mad get vaccine. 80-85% population vaccinated, would happening. Period. Instead, millions people country get vaccinated, science damned. changes, ones 'taking year away you', shower anger, fellow students, faculty staff. they're bought paid enemies state they're much damage possible.

... come better hypothesis! hospitalization rate 5 11 year olds 1 500,000? Yes, like president.

He'll running '24. Guaranteed. One problems teaching online inability accurately judge students perceiving material. Good teachers regularly assess pace material based many factors, among facial expressions students. Forcing students teachers wear masks removes enormous communication channel believe forms critical component effective education. real shame. 

Also, auto mod extremely aggressive. Hopefully deems post appropriate. Fox shifted tenor past couple weeks. Manslaughter homicide unintentional killing another person. 

Murder defined one person killing another person malice aforethought. 

The government knows exactly result be. one person actions another person ... would call murder. know places affected colonialism, vivid understanding cheating people do. Yeah, cause Oakland hotbed Trump voters. everyone worldwide requires booster every 6 months forever, would dream scenario Pfizer. I’m saying boosters aren’t beneficial, drug company happens data showing need buy use specific product, find bit hard believe motives solely altruistic. Lolla least required proof vaccination negative test enter. foolproof something.  break. human survive without sleep live stress long. affect ability provide competent care affect immune system general health susceptible infection.

If staff start getting sick well, then... Abbott still care. Florida Mississippi beg differ. Texas Tyrant again. Lm crㅇㅉㅁㅂ Agree heard lot people saying going burn quick.

I know since takes 6 weeks vaccine go full effect readily available. check KN95s NIOSH certified list get good one. want good seal let air out. able smell anything N95/KN95 on. Get one loops around head rather around ears get proper fit. tequila man could also Canada's choice wait 8 weeks shots. There's evidence may effective way. possible someone Covid immunity even without antibodies? small state too: little 3 million people. really missing lol using first generation vaccines. ""clinical trial"" large scale. rare person could die become permanently injured taking chance using medicines, even know work permanent basis, would make sense sit something else comes along.

I specific reaction certain drugs. reaction kill experiencing wish would. fucking way would use vaccine danger causing making sensitive it. Sorry general public. Thankfully issue otherwise typing right now. people legitimate medical concern specific available vaccines, based reality vaccine could affect them, understand someone opts out.  Well, [Uncle go feed worms. part equation. plenty aysmptomatic cases people don’t get tested do. 

I mean really think guy Arkansas said herd immunity fuck August last year went got test fever cough 2 days? 

Add together probably get 4x etc. actually tough Cooper NC balancing act Democratic governor red-leaning state. can't impose restrictions respected followed.  drove Maryland Texas back immediately CDCs announcement. part, McDonald's employees people saw wearing masks. fuck yes rule! Archive link: walk behind moron hit head frying pan! one things don’t want conform fact via getting vaccine. It’s like something fence about. don’t get whole fence. someone actually gets covid confirm it’s actually real serious. facts state virus real get vaccine. people get “facts” believe bs that’s spewed needing vitamin shit. Wtf wrong people. That’s insane 😕 yeah don’t get people problem others wearing it. seriously triggers people it’s dumb hell   Contrary popular belief, antivaxxers make US. France Japan significantly worse regard. forget antivaxx movement came first place... UK

What number antivaxxers countries whether majority U.S.? I'm confused. vaccines effective, 70% adults vaccinated, many problems covid spikes right now? math behind makes sense me. think plan make believe antibodies exist absolutely one able survive covid mild symptoms magical vaccine really work like vaccine instead functions like flu shot... Thanks link!

Interesting, I'd love see get this. Gonna look trial it.

I got Moderna shots Feb/Mar bet Pfizer shot would fine get since they're mRNA.

I heard anything concrete now, sounds like recent development ""for sure"" thing. apologies previous comment came hostile/accusatory, write way rereading giving vibe haha.  I've mindset zero sympathy could vaccinated, chose to. someone country vaccination going well could, feels like slap face. 

However, possibility variants might make best approach. I'm making life impossible antivaxers tho.

Fine them. Make unable enter travel anywhere. Deny services. cant care enough others get vaccinated, dont get live society like rest us Ha, exactly! imagine asking Douche Bro Brigade give lifted trucks? else would hide pot bellies, double chins, bad haircuts in?? I’ve read behavior, think it’s called STUPIDITY. /s

I friends thought process. matter say scientific papers stats (like 613,000 died USA year) shared, don’t believe don’t believe affect they’re fit healthy. They’re actually fit probably couldn’t run mile without lung exploding.

I don’t really understand goes head. won’t believe Covid get it. Even get Covid don’t get seriously sick, they’ll say “Covid nothing simple cold”. It’s fucking mind-boggling

I know people died Covid. know others long term Covid side effects rest lives. also know people get Covid didn’t get really sick. I’ve seen full spectrum people Covid. lucky gotten Covid. I’m trying protect family I’m responsible. fine dandy unless you’re area bad outbreak need receive medical attention hospital getting vaccine great people  governor outlawed mask mandates schools. Also wants anyone California know fully open tourism.  problem Texas Florida large population centers massive corporations stationed there. local McDonald's reopened dining months ago. week ago, COVID-19 numbers breaking previous records county, removed old, fading signs requiring masks. today--still indoor dining, mask sight.

I live small town Central Florida currently boasts test positivity rate almost 25%, vaccination rate less 45%. Sigh.... happened nicer guy. Pfizer got first time (in home state earlier year)

I moved clinic desperately trying give Pfizer. moment sort went like….why not? (They didn’t Moderna) Sad. Age? wonder end state zero covid approach. already vaccination rates similar US, encountering vaccine hesitancy.

Their lockdowns measures extremely disruptive society. get diminishing returns measures. long keep people break wonder? Covid doesn’t seem going away. I'm happy baby.  Stay safe. [‘Like we’re island’: Missouri’s inaction allowed delta variant took two weeks afterwards finally feel relieved. :) so? Clinics CVS, Walgreens, etc open bottle even there's one person scheduled vaccine day toss remaining doses. 

Also vaccine hesitancy resulted lot doses sitting around waiting expire. one going make rounds confiscating unused doses stuff back warehouse. Vaccines yet left warehouses could probably donated abroad enough coordination. I'm hopeful unvaccinated getting slapped natural antibodies soon, booster shot probably around corner, may last hooray. Awesome post! Thank  No, one aunt. 

But troubles gauging risk breakthrough infections likely contract infection someone else fully vaccinated. live, 62% vaccinated number great already. breakthrough infections become serious problem, IDK protect without going back social distancing. article link talks uncomfy number fully vaccinated people got infected. believe Spanish Flu killed younger people alarming rate, versus Covid average death age 70’s 80’s. Covid absolutely nothing common Spanish flu state medical care 2021 bears resemblance medical care 1918.

Most people died Spanish flu actually died secondary bacterial pneumonia would survived simoke course antibiotics. Thailand experiences bad bad delta wave right now.

One hospitals stopped providing care COVID patients 75 certain conditions.

Heartbreaking doctors patients alike. Appreciate it. didn’t ask them. Doctor gave two choices. said could keep oxygen, pretty certain I’d get progressively worse could monoclonal antibody infusion. guess that's one good thing come variant. Hopefully continue mask too. say I've seen mask wearing lately bs couple weeks ago Remember 95%, 88% whatever, *relative* number. means compared unvaccinated people 95 88% less likely get it. 
 
So got ridiculous exponential curve growth among unvaccinated right now, positivity rates higher they've ever been... 5 12% piece pie still pretty fucking steep curve. 
 
Cutting original strain Rt ~3-4 95% easily put Rt &lt;1. Rt ~8, reducing efficacy ~80% still well 
 
Vaccinated people still living growing pandemic. different slope unvaccinated. Kind like two separate disease. 
 
 
I'd think way: vaccinated friends may survived movie night theater spread bunch seats away other. 
But unvaccinated person, even way corner away friends, still would screwed. ""alongside"" 

Also, condescending. It’s killing hospitalizing old people now. feel like almost everyone knows someone right hospital isn’t 80. scares people. lawyer still walking around dressed like Death? Yeah 57% seems accurate.  Still good evidence virus getting stronger Israel indeed releasing data, far they've mostly shit quality. even know collect them. believe vaccine efficacy wane bit time Israeli data basically useless prove that. Spanish flu another level though. Average life expectancy temporarily dropped 12 hears outbreak. covid 1 year US, half Sweden. many friends family unvaccinated knuckleheads? Anyone stupid someone want hang around anyway. anti vax unvaccinated like vegans. Gotta tell everyone!!  That's illegal. can't subject non-emergency medical procedure without explicit consent. Even flu shot. Looking data, seems like Delta peaked states already. makes really happy. Im tired covid men, get people dont care anymore. I'd wondered 'superspreader' thing came from. antivaxer work talking it, trying get anyone would listen, get vaccinated. Good information here. I'm sorry hear this.  Best wishes her. Delta variant. friends/family made them. Pretty much everyone getting vaccine converted skeptic. 

There’s also still massive group people holding full FDA approval. another group somehow thinks whole ordeal immigrants coming across border. tell what's happening experience, commenter replied making dark joke. see people watch Fox News antivaxx both; told someone family friend several died covid first thing would say that's sad. second thing would come mouth old they? effort quick told moment (""see told old people dying!"") that's okay/polite/acceptable. daughter got twice issue transmission vaccinated individuals. know occur even 100% population vaccinated. soon vaccinated individuals stop ""reasonable social distancing"", infection transmission occur them, thus increase inevitable occurence vaccine-resisting strains.  


We still billions people vaccinated. People infected spreading virus. exact conditions gave us problematic variants. Yeah worry summer tourism really adding counties spread :( people everywhere feel like locking even though I’m vaxxed! Republicans hate citizens. think really simple. see us filthy, disgusting people deserve die.

I like cynical, explanation fits actions. Removed because....? Indeed. maybe would taken approach like “15 days slow spread” one quick lockdown would flatten whole curve. 

Sort like data vaccine reduces chance severe disease **once manage contract it** ~half. 
 
The reason vaccinated hospitalizations deaths relatively low 1) comparing *extremely* vulnerable group, unvaccinated virus estimated rate transmission ~8 2) rate spread among vaccinated people slow. seemingly positive. 
 
Considering vaccine takes 10% hospitalization rate makes 5%, that's still something want get. average seasonal cold. talk case load: 
 
If Rt even bit, means vaccinated people need stop pre-pandemic behavior understand risk they're actually at. 5% hospitalization rate something live with. needs public health control. 
 
And order make policy decision public health control, need actual data much spreading. Beyond hospitals. Glad pandemic finally over! Whew! can’t wait get flu bunch underage kids drop molly. Totally worth it. Don’t predict everyone vaccine. may surprised find. wedding month personally called everyone invited asked personally vaccination status. ones refused longer coming. still surprised would thought would it. Yup. seeing 2023-24 estimates *everyone* would fully vaccinated (or least opportunity). People fucking minds think world going continue living way another two three years.   Wow, compact crowd consisting thousands idiots could covid cases? Thanks warning, experts.  covid before? Experts, also casual observers basically anyone slightest foothold reality. think get bad last winter, many people vaccinated now. 

That said, think good, seem like wave peaked quite yet. 

I talking ass though. variant easier spread one knows. lot less likely outbreak spawned delta variant delta variant already existed helped exacerbate outbreak. difficult decision. want kid back school badly. sincere hope weeks in, masks become required go ahead re-enroll him. hope we're going see numbers slowly rise. one holdout co-worker said getting pressure sources (than me, lol). grandmother aunts vaccinated pressuring to. *says* going within next week. think people like scared reason, people know IRL get it, real adverse reaction it, inclined get it. 

Then we'll people losing loved ones realize really *need* get it. article day 39 year old father died it, *intending* get vaccinated, decided wait year make sure plenty time administered studied whatnot. Yikes. Worse airplane. take comfort data coming San Diego Virginia. Anecdotal data anecdotal, know whole family got sick late June, tested negative. friend mine owes $100. told could consider repaid went got covid vaccine. Waiting see take (although it’s ridiculous hasn’t happened yet). Fully vaxxed got it:

Fever 3 days medicine helping, cough, congestion, lost smell briefly like 2 days slowly started coming back. I'm still extremely exhausted reason, feeling times, though symptoms besides slight cough subsided. Last day isolation last Thursday I'm still freshly recovering.

I got JnJ wonder sick one mRNA ones knows human event doesn’t mutate virus. virus mutates strain/variant needs spread compete strains. virus would mutated delta variant first, people infected would go festival order spread never dialed up, never disagreed you. even said happen women. 

I think misreading intent. gets back, make take binaxnow home test. 15 minute result. mean else do? get people. Ok lunatic buy fake one, that's still better half people gym vaccinated. Lol, yes. saying, wait, mutation causes start over. It’s like bad movie I’ve seen already. hate gatekeeping, WFH wear sporadically wear office....don't tell ""it's bad."" feels like gaslighting point. also sucks anyone hearing loss. think asking people social distance late game unrealistic.

I got 2 jabs, wear mask, practice common sense.

Yes, did. fully support vaccine, standards plummeted due delta. went 95% preventing infection vaccine literally around unvaccinated people ""you expect prevent infection around unvaccinated"".

I fully support vaccines, say ""no one ever said that"" untrue. true, would least expected cross-check photo ID. understand cards easy forge, could least added degree difficulty one likes using labels seem pushing agenda assuming one looking people around me. free independently ignorant; somewhere else.

Virological serological kinetics SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant vaccine-breakthrough infections: multi-center cohort study. medRxiv, podcast *The Daily* NY Times. www.nytimes.com/thedaily cool would mean least 70% adults opposed getting vaccine. would willing bet &lt;30% vaccinated, anti-vax, vaccinated yet practical reasons. 

 Now, considering this, much vaccine propaganda pumped news? seems like issue shoved throats every day. attend year every year multiple check points several layers fencing. really looks like made entry still pass security get wrist band scanned bunch people spouting ""Only 0.03% vaccinated people"" statistic. Nuance part lot conversations, unfortunately. Yeah, lockdowns suck. mean, provide cover Desantis/Abbott, doesn’t entirely explain it, no?

There’s lots places fight masks/distancing (I’m ID right essentially nobody wearing masks life back normal). Hell, despite initial epicenter Delta, Missouri seen case growth largely stall out, despite large lack measures.

I think there’s still lot don’t understand disease, besides fact states lower vaccination rates tend much greater outbreaks (FL somewhat exception) claim exempt required test 2x week. think naive view. look SCOTUS holdings regarding illegal immigrants power state detain them, continuing saga Gitmo.

Where court sees existential threat country power state sees little limitation. difference COVID disease never seen way. fact one whole party attached notion ""it's sniffles"". Agreed. feel like side effect 24-hour news cycle. say whatever wild shit want, really matter, they're already next day's events anyone realizes wrong were.

Sure, *some* people notice, what's incentive stop it? got clicks and/or views. unvaccinated overwhelming want protection.

They aren’t worried virus living normal last year sacrificed.

I think right allow events proceed, hopefully rising cases encourage people get vaccinated. It’s probably thing will.  deer need masks. Nah. I'm healthy, young individual vaccinated me. risk issues, even delta variant, insignificant me. Yes hit like yesterday Basement dwellers love moral high ground best: nothing  It’s state state. NJ app too. Security guard isn’t paid enough actually care Yeah. interest reading that. based strains half contagious less Delta, fwiw. never said leave house. Americas approach much different Europe’s. can’t blame Bring idea Vegas hotels, casinos restaurants. need need bad. wife got covid May 2020 nobody anything related contact tracing even back then. DeSantis morning similar song dance claiming hospitals fine empty beds.

...

But nobody staff them. Guy literally advocating genocide, jesus. Ugh. can’t believe we’re going another winter nightmares. vaccines readily available. Mooove butt closest vaccine clinic kid's exactly age. I'm disappointed school's opening vaccine horizon. really want send her, already struggles social interaction, I'm really torn. go outside, go stores, go parks, safe manner. live life safe manner way good conscious look crowded lollapalooza was, close everyone was, screaming/singing/yelling/talking whole time... even outside setting incredibly short-sighted put concert way was. 

If made fully verified vaccinated people could get in, also limit amount people spread 1-3 feet per group would totally different.

I want get back real normal much everyone (I hate wearing mask, others protection), unless start events actual safe manner never come. people die and/or suffer covid variants time goes on. Elaborate please. think it’s indoor activities likely bars clubs wonder shorter interval doses may cause lower immunity used longer 8-12 week gap. Almost every day 30-40,000 fans Cubs White Sox game *with restrictions* never articles cases surging. Lolla happens one weekend required vaccination negative test cases going surge? really data yet. Remember Delta effects started taking hold July 1. hope get better estimate come late August. time reclassify breakthrough infections rare uncommon. Texas 4x amount cases New York double population. That’s huge success think is….. Realistically, take kids crowded public indoor settings vaccinated. Yes changes direction leaves many experts baffled. Lol show day Lollapalooza realize caches covered stages 😂 That's smart you, likely save lot stress. grandmother bother sharing details mother, general age. mother spent years worrying whether everything going right entered menopause gave explicit detail surprised stop.

You’re meant 5 daily cases 50,000 smfh  long term PTSD. aren’t schools funded district state tho? swing 30,000 votes across 3 states- AZ, GA, WI- would given trump 269 electoral votes, causing tie would throw election state house delegations, gop majority.

So wasnt close terms overall votes, due electoral college, small number votes could swung election way. Plus says “coronavirus”, “covid19”. Tried read article paywall…  always going happen, lot people finally decide get shots too. Obviously hope feel better example vaccination prioritized even covid. I'm going honest here. fair amount anger towards people refused getting vaccinated. also fair amount anger towards conservative media spouting nonstop anti-vax BS. Sorry ""mostly preventable"" mean never leave house, proposing.  Attending events outdoors, masks indoor, vaccinations. acceptable sacrifices. Never going outside house one entire world ever willing do, even though thinking solution this. virus us, likely rest lives. again, enough guilt trips. ...and Indian variant developed. agree. predict shortages almost everything foreseeable future unless China pivots zero covid approach. last guy racist that. don’t know data friend got January hospital. got late May. didn’t ""that badly"" said second time hard tell he’s still coughing first round. Unvaccinated because, ""had won’t get again…"". Except it’s, ""had twice…"". even high risk area! guess Delta variant virulent, takes little.

A bad omen.  missed said know can?! 
Bloody agreed stated body reacted previously WOULD HAVE. good many others.

Dial down; we're disagreement. swear reddit told yesterday 70% eligible people US received least one dose far. mean, linked news article, random redditor. so, that's encouraging. know lot people morons it, there's ton people get under-12 kids vaccinated soon they're cleared to. Yeah messaging. Plus, many people read would probably go CDC quote (the one make blanket statement) statement expert Hartford (who actually nuance).  media gets money people pay attention them. Best way exploiting human tendencies react first think second, using clickbait controversy, even none really exists. 

A lot people thought vaccine would prevent getting disease. people vaccine getting something big deal! them. us educate understand body knows deal something mean quickly easily, still possible infected, lesser symptoms. different incident 
The one talking about, guy went back outside got gun, came back shot cashier got back festival Saturday Sunday. understood vaccination/negative test requirement foolproof, however, purchased tickets months ago assumption US would reached much higher percentage vaccinated adults. Alas, weekend came went Delta variant almost guaranteed spreading event, even vaccinated people like myself. really much else say. Covid certainly anybody went unvaccinated serious risk. Link full article: delta variant joke twice weekly covid tests *at expense* Yea usually get sick cold get sore throat first symptoms appear. don’t think ever did? may okay *for you*, still needs told unacceptable. many reasons someone — even someone wants get vaccinated! — might need talk getting vaccinated. know left leaning, shithole Dallas Illinois fully vaccinated rate actually lower even Florida, slightly higher first dose. much better hot zone. paranoid. 9 days I've cold symtpoms, sore throat, cough today, slight fever beginning... rapid tested 3x within last 8 days negative wonder gotten pcr test. fully vaxxed Moderna, though worth. Maybe tomorrow I'll get pcr test... exactly supposed feel children growing without selfish, entitled scientifically illiterate role models?

You’re supposed feel bad them. Lies. 1/3 number covid patients hospitalized Arkansas compared back January

In January Arkansas 2900 peope hospitalized, compared 1000 now. number people Arkansas hospitalized coronavirus reached new high Friday second day row case count rose ADH report shows 18 hospitalizations last 24 hours, number 1,105 hospitalized patients think base core identity culture enables fosters it. 
I lucky immediate family friends (after slight paring down) fully sane camp. 
What stinks seems Herculean task overcome challenges face. 
Wish us luck, need! Well yes no. problem hands levers money city governments one looking local reporting largely takes backseat national international reporting. 

Which one reads anyway.

But without guy quietly sitting city council chambers midsized cities anymore, writing people say, saying shit would believe. Early on, got argued Redditor no, kids don’t serve vector fo passing disease around, way things like yearly cold. 

He cited statistic Denmark somewhere. 

I wa alike, sure, buddy—it’s true sometimes science contradicts common sense, world different children, biologically, would make disease work differently?”
  Faster immune system, sure. Smaller lungs nasal passages, maybe breathe smaller amounts virusbut would offset time spent together proximity., would higher school families, volume speech amount talked, would higher kids. gonna need like 90 percent herd immunity Delta around.

That ""herd immunity"" concept thrown around since early 2020 HUGE load bullshit time-wasting nonsense. vote this, data clear, delta way transmissible find vaccinated, risk way lower unvaccinated first wave likely outbreak caused Delta, rather way around. Interesting. wonder less staff. Unless state medical provider dint restriction via hippa Fundamentally media public health body whose main goal improve public health. nominal goal spread information really heaping dose ""in way keeps people interacting us making money"" top. Scary stories keep people watching, reporting breakthrough infections, particularly numerous anecdotes rather actual statistics scares people. Also keep mind HUUUGE number cases recent past came super spreader event cape Provincetown. Putting aside, things actually horrible here.

Source: live Boston Obviously, lack masking help, Texas Florida also 2nd 3rd populous states behind California. Right voters Desantis afford care about, skew (D) vote lower rates ones 55. also pushed like crazy Republican well enclaves vaccinated, soon areas reached 70% suddenly resources dried up. state (FL) doesn’t care getting vaccinated trying stop spread we’ve got governor everything spread virus. people don’t care believe whole thing hoax stupid cold. Since breakthrough cases happening it’s matter time get variant vaccine can’t stop we’ve gotta start square one again. state keep crap going long possible, It’s Florida. long DeSantis running shit show it’s going get better time soon. long take get negative test breakthrough infection? I’m vaccinated caught covid vacation stuck another country isolating myself. Hoping I’ll able get negative test 2 week isolation period come home. Idk people upset. never going vaccine cover variants. reason vaccine common cold. virus mutates much vaccine totally effective it. Every year want get flu vaccine whatever strain flu ""think"" prominent year. Usually wrong sometimes get right. Lots people get flue vaccines every year hope keep getting flu. covid vaccine end like flu shot get one every year. Ahh. Got it. know people straight street drugs vaccine hesitant. weird backwards thinking. super spreader event relying honor code middle ongoing pandemic could bring new COVID cases?! I. Am. Shocked. Also apparently lambda variant vaccine resistant according one study? hope it’s true pissed Sturgis last year, fucking Lollapalooza I’m indifferent. feel like shit never ending. get 3rd vaccine? unless lambda circulating kept quiet. He’s frustrating historically moments leads behaves like statesman, still eager boot lick traitors.

Indonesia's plan? exactly go well...  mention vaccinated person significantly likely bother getting tested vs somebody denies virus even exists. I'm pharmacy manager. see future interviews going like already.

""Are vaccinated?""

""That's private""

""Okay we'll let know shortly bring on!"" *throws application trash* vaccine like wearing fullbody armor compared getting slashed shirt on.

I hate simplistic metaphors dumb discourse

No, vaccine ""full body armor."" Umm think it’s pronounced whacko... I'm exact position. guess ladies like us never know. went concert. South Africa close civil war virus. feeling cases vastly underreported. Look Tunisia outbreak causing political turmoil. Question: media trying drive breakthrough cases thing? feel like would probably drive people get vaccine even approach. it’s like “oh look! got vaccine, it’s working still got I”  know. family 50-50 pfizer Moderna.My wife also Moderna, I'm sure one got sick sore throat day hit me. sore throat first noticeable symptom too. 2 teens Pfizer shot, one asthma sick, one slight cough appears healthy overall. suppose family would valuable data interested. think might peaking week?

We havent numbers since Friday time trend **up**.

The Delta spike going 3-4 weeks UK etc 6 week spike. vaccination rate way lower theirs. disgusting enlightened centrism shit. dude still slimy shitball vaccine advocacy nothing considering stood Trump stirred swamp created mess today. Lindsay Graham advocating vaccines nothing, all. Period. overcomplicating this.

The ""less 1%"" headline pulled straight KFF rate breakthrough cases reported among fully vaccinated well 1% reporting states.

The 0.01% number is, noted, talking something different. wrong. 70% population vaccinated current spike trend resembles last summer's spike 0% population vaccinated...what fuck going on???

1. Delta variant.
2. Vaccines losing effectiveness require didn’t really enforce it. Lots reports kids jumping fences. 1. completed vaccination young — ones likely spread disease?
2. immunity faded yet? clinical benefit boosting immunity now, opposed six months' time (which could tailored new variant, maybe provide bigger boost?) actual thing

Oh, ok. Thanks. Absolutely - it’s sad see. love visit America probably continue it’s shame guys dealing toxicity. way suggesting it’s unique country certainly seems prevalent there. change drastic. went ""I'm finally able live"" ""well course still catch virus vaccine perfect"" quickly.   

And get try reign society schools begin opening work places started returns. going mess. Texas Democrat here. despise him, he's reason we're headed back Covid mess. He's taken away measures us stop spread, political points. set since 12 hope it’d solid. 50% people U.S. fully vaccinated.  need  least  70% control virus spread.

&amp;#x200B;

After 70% we're still shit.

Sorry, delta variant, need 90%.

Also, vaccine losing effectiveness.

See Israel 39%. Umm, completely mangling saying? course others pull bootstraps. awkward, potentially painful, done. 

But saying goes, cannot, however, pull bootstraps. physically impossible. Saturday began symptoms. earlier week? Congressfolk constantly cross contact lot staffers. Show part wishing Chinese deaths excusing 600k dead USA. derail simple unloaded question. That's roughly 0.5% total population per day - highly decent.

It's young population, though, eligible population might low proportion total. Why? comments falling deaf ears. He’ll RINO sellout morons don’t want vaccinated. reason pat back small sliver decency. already children grandchildren, Darwinism.  None food mcdonalds kill you. Look ingredients (seriously.) basic stuff.

Mcdonald's becomes unhealthy people eat often. Otherwise, par lots home cooking. Bacon, eggs, burgers, fries; they're mcdonald's people eat home. eat burgers (bread, meat, cheese) home, going unhealthy ate mcdonald's. solutions state provides come state's budget things. So, want places provide solutions comes budget. Namely local budgets. Remember Biden Harris telling people take Trump vaccines? Remember Trump took vaccine told supporters take vaccine? do. 

The top anti-vaccine groups black Hispanic, exactly Trump base. hardcore Trump people (the Alex Jones/Ron Paul crowd) antivaccine well. recent history, anti-vaccers Democrats. People need stop overly politicizing this. safe go maskless prominent Democrats stating intent continue wear masks science want mistaken Republicans. Biden's lectures vaccines taking credit vaccines said coming days/weeks companies announced breakthroughs. politicization goes way back February 2020 Trump attacked China travel ban calling limited quarantine zones Westchester County, local leaders New York refused anything (except go Chinatown theater maskless tell others same). fat, middle aged white guys saw New York City mass transportation system flaunting mask mandate couple weeks ago. mostly black people! 

And Democrats internet accusing Republicans politicized this! OK, Trump hugely stupid things, like disinfectant comment setting bad example wearing masks White House, overall see others better Coronavirus. People need take partisan blinders try reasonable once. don’t fall trap thinking people represent majority country. 
Sure pretty large portion country batshit crazy, also lot us don’t fall camp. Hopefully Lollapalooza gets nice CDC study get data large scale events require vaccines/negative tests. confused. vaccines effective, 70% adults vaccinated, many problems covid spikes right now? 

The vaccine losing effectiveness everyone even vaccinated.

That cold truth nobody wants hear accept.

We already need booster. mean can't still happen. time need initiative fostered society individualism both?

Especially us kids &lt;12, idiotic fight masks without even considering them. Like wanna vector brings home cause tiny piece cloth deal breaker life. Polio 99-100% Smallpox 95% preventing infection entirely. Polio vaccine may well perfect smallpox vaccine way effective covid's disease harder spread. Coronaviruses also already endemic, one joins them. It’s legal. Apparently proven profitable location remain drive thru only. AZ. think MAYBE barely crossed 50%. delta wave squashed

After living last year-and-a-half bad news, think another variant pop immediately delta squashed (IF delta ever squashed). Yes UNITED STATES, government. allowed talk reality grievances without million Europeans flooding thread incredible country is. KNOW! happy price page. wish country founded literal genocide, capitalism, racism it’s hard move away that. 

It’s amazing much certain people like come shit people already struggling. Like saw post grieving mom sharing bill stillbirth top comments cost parking fee deliver baby _____. It’s like, lol know ____ free healthcare majority Americans want like said country founded literal capitalism avg citizens like don’t voice it’s billionaires. gotta say, last time listened twelve well listening realized kinda twelve identify music. parents send kids school end jail

Tell fo F#$% anyways. get worse. outbreak Massachusetts happen then? news happening assuming? mean Thailand managed get decent free healthcare system installed years. believe America! half vaccinated? Morally yes friend get 3 vaccines go back school? probably month that. imagine people limited travel wasn’t necessary point, especially coming hot spot like Florida? could probably avoid lot unnecessary infections 🤷🏼‍♀️  quite opposite. chooses live life fear, faith (in humanity). Homeschool time Many people sub did. may one them. got caught good numbers looked Mar May. Rides skateboard news hyping breakthrough infections imagine would harder convince people. IMO, infected contagious person produces infected droplets nose *and* mouth. crowded setting involves forceful expulsion air (cheering stadium crowds; choir; concerts; bars/restaurants patrons talking louder background noise...) bad, bad idea.

Properly worn masks barrier method keep germs yourself. country (ph) we're going back lockdown friday. essential going outside. like going grocery/bank/etc. that, allowed. never? vaccines offer sterilizing immunity. Many (including covid-19 vaccines) don't. Measles vaccine example vaccine makes unable get disease. CDC ""misleading"" people? proof pudding, large scale, hospitalization deaths exceedingly rare. point vaccine, CDC correct that. People understanding science front another matter. I'm really sorry hear this, sorry loss. uneasy well although I'm late 40s I'm really high risk due serious lung condition. Ready info boosters etc. makes happy :) Haahahahhaha mandate won’t matter. can’t/won’t enforce it. told internet children spread covid.

/s month later goal, least hit it! flu shots going mandatory too? get flu booster mean boss gonna call Friday morning send packing?

Is supposed joke? Flu vaccination mandatory hospital EMS workers years. Yes, get ""sent packing."" read comment god didnt want to.. covid even bible?! Why? masks delay inevitable fact us probably catch covid saw tweet day antivaxxer said “I find suspicious covid targeting unvaccinated.” 

.... uhhh 🤦‍♀️ Pikachu face next election cycle covid first time?  least Waco “Immune delta strain” vaccinated people catching delta en masse entire post makes zero sense. stumbled upon houston news channel youtube cant believe comments vax. almost anti vax comments.. i'm shocked! That's said. I'm saying CDC federal government continued mislead people common breakthrough cases were. Houston physically hell morally emotionally rewarding. Dallas physically fine destroys soul. Well guess cannot really blame countries hold mass religious festival pandemic go trouble actually click links, see don’t show claim show. Regarding first link, actually says children’s mental health emergency department visits DECREASED pandemic. “This report demonstrates that, whereas overall number children’s mental health–related ED visits decreased, proportion ED visits children’s mental health–related concerns increased.”

When kids virtual school, lot fewer emergency room visits physical injuries. also fewer visits mental problems, didn’t decrease much physical problems, ratio mental problems physical problems higher. You’re real mental contortions say get kids back previous situation, kids needed go emergency room mental physical problems often. shit Sherlock. It’s 5% breakthrough infections, California 1.5% Arizona highest 4.5%, sure why, it’s hot side maybe people clustered indoors….Encouraging microchips injected block 5G well! 3 50+ here, UK. That's pretty par course Abbott \*will bring

FTFY describes workplace. Ugh. Looks like Florida cases highest since beginning, hospitalizations high highest appear still increased deaths high previous waves though deaths lagging indicator. 

California cases hospitalizations much lower previous waves. However, increasing trend. 

I think bad right highly dependant are. was/am clinical trial Novavax. agree premise here, correct numbers bit 30,000 people US trial, 15,000 UK, South Africa. least US, crossover trial, ~30k (minus dropped early) eventually got vaccine. ACA allow it, could amended without repealed. Hopefully, spent time Trump recently. ""There rejected repeatedly admission,"" said interview. ""In midst excitement Olympics, situation medical personnel severe""

I doubt much done Olympics.


I province Canada 83% 1 dose 66% 2 doses

Get level US ! another problem 1/3rd vaccines expired care, vaccinated. probably natural immunity now. 

1. would want force someone bearing health?
2. would set precident forced shots refuse. Good thing they’re applying Covid restrictions event… Yeah, think I'll discount gossip. see evidence Abe Suga administrations cared making Japanese vaccine, say June 14th, 2020 curiosity, weren’t able get sooner? agree, wonder access blood samples ""influenza"" patients around 2018. Auburn grad reporting - Got fuck Alabama soon possible. wife (she also alum) glad Milwaukee vaccination rates much higher.

We vaccinated months now! Fair points. I'd like add, though, significant portion undeveloped world even know covid is. internet, access built areas, come contact anyone people tribe/village, never exposed it. 

In developed world, travel much more. Taking flight across US seasonal festival common, traveling another country EU work/play is.

Places like India, China, Pakistan, Brazil, Indonesia huge populations - relatively - rich US/EU, engaging mass vaccinations: India (470M), China (1.7B), Pakistan (30M), Brazil (143M), Indonesia (69M).  European championship caused absolutely MASSIVE spike reproduction rate Italy. went 0.65 1.75 3 weeks. Great. Let's lockdown bc selfish 30% Uh okay...?

There comment saying **""He’s never anti-vaccines""**

I provided evidence where, even mins, ""anti-vax"".

Seperately wasnt ""a bit skeptical"". literally shared Bill Gates conspiracy theory vaccines..... Thank FantasticMasturbator  Florida already number daily cases hitting last summer hospitalizations nearing last summer’s numbers. Texas like day away passing spike last summer cases hospitalizations line going steeply up. last summer one vaccinated. 

The unvaccinated really bad time thing follows patterns last year. nurse. LPN saying they're nurse social media false. RN also different levels education, associates level RN still title masters level RN. Delta dominant variant Netherlands time now. 

Breakthrough infections fully vaccinated adults leading hospitalizations observed immunocompromised people far. many hospitalized covid before.
Nobody publishes data.
It's weird, would convinced many people. pretty easy gather information. base one killed greater numbers. one's prosecuted registering 35 years, let alone actually convicted imprisoned. Even something incredibly rare multiply entire population it’s really big number. also saying Delta Variant way like it’s new disease. Definitely - know many people said “by September 2021 pandemic pretty much over”? Avoid reposting information, please. one covid-19 ancestors. need testing different species time range.

Snippet USDA study.

Antibodies also detected three samples 2020 one sample 2019. detections observed samples 2011-2018 Put refuse vaccinate solitary confinement. point though people get vaxxed get Covid. masks delay. last guy's travel ban china late completely missed actually ended seeding first waves COVID America - Europe (Italy particular). many counties near festival hit Biden's ""70% adults vaccinated"" target month ago 

India? much That’s true, it’s 2 weeks take J&amp;J CDC Mask ""Mandate""?

Cool. wouldn’t officials saying should. Keep doses people haven’t vaccinated all. think people declaring end American freedom know it! also apply tourists? I’m planning visit, one travel companions afraid vaccine. (I can’t access article) anti vaxxers covid deniers masquerading something else. Thanks part.  We're 90% 12+ year olds Seattle suburbs. Things mostly normal masks still common sight. Less 50% state vaccinated least 1 dose. 58% states 1 dose.

Maybe let’s shit folks say they’re getting shot? get pissed, don’t clap back. plenty places reddit vent late-comers isn’t directly face they’ve even got shot. Thanks! Damn, that's good.

Where go? fucking thing would actually ended 2019 made dick fall off. mean events Electric Zoo? Labor day weekend, hopefully included ‘venues’ ‘entertainment’ Also clarify: first shot seem give benefit first week well. definitely sooner better. points mo correlation yours, numbering points. pretty crazy reason assume someone ignorant, numbered points? Wow.

Edit- points correlation *order* points  Trump even talked vaccine office. know anyone want it. data says contagious without symptoms? Sure, I'm saying kids go school, that's discussion here. fact vaccines (and masks) means kids vaccinated wearing masks go back school. parent that's allowing kids go school unmasked unvaccinated negligent, kids other's kids well. Also, different disease back then. variant changed things pretty dramatically. feels like fair. vax avail free. results vax clear. kids age 12? Unfortunately people assume vaccines prevent covid sure shit are! fatigue exhaustion experienced hospital overwhelming. We’re understaffed load high. people vaccinated resume life like normal. What's point vaccinations we're gonna keep locking down.  bar set low americans dont uderstand even vaccinated western approved vaccines still get still spread it. Might die it, might even hospitalized catch it. They're less

The difference dosage amount gets transported

Decent article this: Unfortunately death work with. many triple amputee cases 4,196? agree. doesn’t seem “extremely” rare point. Even LA’s numbers 20% breakthroughs cases. I’ve 2 two colds summer. That’s I’ve ever one summer. got tested first one negative. be. nothing paper only. NY requirement quarantine 14 days entered another state, almost everyone ignored it. bigfarma makes effort get 3rd world vaccinated point valid. now. pay get vaccinated many afford. corona around. makes money. bars clubs? Five weeks, no? Pfizer 3 week wait period. think two groups: ""crazies"" ""lazies"".

The crazies never going get vaccine because... reasons. know one right Delta+ currently taking monoclonal antibodies. guess ""new"" antibodies okay, ""new"" vaccine not? Anyway...

The ""lazies"" group folks trying get free lunch. Infection rates dropping sharply around time became eligible shot, probably figured could skip it. couple weeks ago, looked like possibility. flu rate hospitalization far lower Covid death rate far lower. Children recieve flu vaccine. 
Atleast saying ""it's common cold"", guess.  fully vaccinated still carry spread COVID19

You fully vaccinated *with breakthrough infection*, still carry spread COVID19. probability getting infected dramatically reduced vaccine.

The vaccinated ""owe"" unvaccinated anything. long hospital capacity, vaccinated people able things want.

If going start restricting vaccinated people do, first mandate everyone eligible get vaccinated. get us back normal. Yeah, understand - really seemed like pandemic fading rearview little there. I'm definitely way replace lost card. I'd hate carry everywhere since important travel now. Limp Bizkit fucking rules! point, compelling arguments I've read that:

1) included tally vaccinated people, skewing percentage vaccinated people higher 
2) official claims boosters needed noted yet although actions governments around world state otherwise (buying half billion dollars worth doses advance, etc.) Biden *43,000* votes electoral college. Yes, race close; fact *that* close EC past four years really says lot Democratic party. Black market fake CDC card explode. seeing getting enforced outside tourist area. end well wife reported changes researcher. details moment. least admitted he’s lazy. means there’s chance he’ll actually get it. Better trying justify wouldn’t get it. love this, hope LA next - children medically exempt? allowed dine in? Yeah, here’s hoping vaccine rate good Provincetown. basically study vaccine preventing bad outcomes delta even breakthroughs happen. member immunity contributes herd immunity, vaccines caught virus. That's anti-vax people refusing measles vaccines problem. herd immunity measles decades pretty good job protecting *can't* vaccinated, dropping numbers low enough we're losing protection.

You're one clue talking about. can’t muster empathy anymore. tried always resolves anger absolutely stupid refuse vaccine would end pandemic.

The headlines see, angrier get them. enough people WORLD vaccinated agaisnt actual variant spreading... fucking rocket science.

Im fully vaccinated pfizer understand delta still fuck still spread it, cant you? clarity: you’re actually considered “fully vaccinated” 2 weeks 2nd shot, minimum 6 weeks shot #1. Proof? people would thrown jail fast. average North America 51, right age start menopause. mothers experience matches expectations. Stopped months, random heavy period, pause, spotting months. end bigger bigger pauses spotting eventually stopped. whole process lasted years, happen once. anywhere actually tracks important stats positivity rate Vaccinated vs Unvaccinated? I’m tired seeing 99.99% vaccinated people haven’t gotten covid. know least Florida. friend’s unvaccinated employee gave others also vaccinated office. Apparently feeling ill middle pandemic doesn’t make think twice coming work. 

My friend took J&amp;J. still smell taste. month ago. Can’t speak employees condition. know none ended hospital that’s good thing. blown away Limp Bizkit set. Expected trash..... exact opposite. lol pretty much already I’m sure you’re talking about. Current cards easy forge. Apps mentioned available got shot NY. need national registry cards/apps actually validated states agency easy forge.

Soon, allowed travel outside country, countries around world require proof vaccine DOUBT flimsy card accepted. video’s bothered gate breach. 5 people second walking past security guard holding piece paper cell phone up. highly infectious disease area unreasonable suspect individuals area may exposed.

Saying ""let us swab nose, presumed positive ordered remain home two weeks"" seem particularly troublesome legal standpoint. Keep mind country arrested people Japanese descent WWII particular suspicion SCOTUS upheld act.

What missing US political industrial capacity it. brought up. know looked math, would need close 90% eligible population vaccinated order get 75% total population. large country close that. use state vaccine (pretty common we’re close NJ)  least they’re outside Yep. Life completely normal live. county 61% vaccinated rising. People living normal lives.

The nightmare point one media tells scares into. excellent. hope see many cities this.

It's win-win.

It make safer everyone dining out/working encourage people go get vaccinated. Fun trick - live near park festival be, go like week two bury shit. Dig hole, wrap rum whatever else bag something bury it. 

Make party hole day festival. Disinformation campaigns target specific demographics (ie, country, language) spread less main stream media US immigrants first Gen may already mistrust. 

If minorities likely poor, may less access transportation PTO get vax. Furthermore, many people may already coronavirus working outside home throughout pandemic. lockdown, minorities hardest hit coronavirus. There's probably less motivation get vaccine infected, would feel way it. wonder going enforce  this..as is, knida hard enforce mask mandate before  Well yes. They’ve always hypocritical like that. idea sweat like crazy masks talk. 

Talking expels lots vapor - vented/ported mask (with surgical mask catch exhaust vapor) helps - still sticky... No, followed science time. ""Most irresponsible""

The fact brought proof vaccinations negative test shows attendees one responsible, actually. Yeah, may fake, vast majority certainly not. think even ignorant assumed since literally shared none points original post.

Just say team medical professionals advising get vaccine noone would even thought trying convince get it.

But vague things state OG post used thousands healthy people simply egoistical get vaccine. ""assume"" things introduce discussion never properly explain. 

I wish best healthwise ofc think absolutely get vaccine. hope encounter people careful spreading germs say sometimes happens even precautions taken. Take care. vaccinated NJ live NYC good NYC app requires picture card mean. delta variant widespread right large outdoor concert never happened first place people responsible. fully vaccinated still carry spread COVID19 others vaccinated thus cycle continues repeat.

Until reach heard immunity, huge festivals like happening. Ah yes, explains it. I’m Germany originally live USA it’s different world comes religion. Tyler absolutely incredible lie. many videos people rushing festival without getting checked. Ah, gotcha. They’re moving fast R party.

“It’s personal choice.”

“We need wait full authorization.” (Honestly, something emergency authorization, probably way scrutiny going paid-in-full full authorization.)

“Maybe get it.”

“F—k you, get now.” Prions usually lot harder spread virus. Usually need ingested injected. mean, example kind like less intense version Provincetown, no? (Tightly packed, indoors, vaccination checks though high vaccination rates). - though roughly 900 cases related cluster - 7 hospitalizations, 0 deaths, test positivity decreasing lots. Vaccinated people 8x less likely get covid. enough rescue transmissibility fully vaccinated cohort. I’m cool large scale events right now. long they’re vaccinated people. Good luck made rules, delta issue question people answer for. plan return real life Yes. see Tyler set? Absolutely incredible. Cant wait Bonnaroo Sept. sounds like impossible calculation. condolences. care puts city danger. entire event mistake. getting shot kills others, selfish simpleton. 11,863 (an increase +1,181) currently hospitalized 2,400 (an increase +252) ICU August 3rd 2021 according going get 100 percent immunity. ppl medical condition cannot get vaccine. like ask people faith fear attitude locking congregation doors 2/3 years ago prevent mass shootings? international students talking about? 

Second, know vaccines work. International students arrive place study month can’t get vaccine country. Simple. Problem solved. 

Masks greatly reduce communication channel teachers students. quicker remove better. vaccines, time move on. Masks made lot sense got vaccines. it’s time abandon them. guess watching live event. guitarist, drummer DJ definitely solid. Fred hand? even know begin.

:( Im premenopausal. May stopped - never missing beat every 28 days. Granted 50 yrs old stops really unusual.
Just timing right second dose. researchers suggest increased infectivity wildfire smoke may due way exposure PM2.5 affects human body. Previous studies demonstrated exposure PM2.5 induce cellular changes, could negatively affect immune response make COVID-19 infection easier. particles may also potentially able carry SARS-CoV-2 virus, researchers researchers also suggest may non-biological factors. Poor air quality could encourage people gather indoors rather outdoors increase spread virus way. Yeah, usually say symptoms subside longer contagious. completely asymptomatic point looks like I’ll stuck full 2 weeks. Thanks! statistics clearly show minimal risk kids, couple dozen Houston exactly crisis. anecdotes, family us one blood type felt awful shot 2 (which included 2x pfizer, 1x moderna) another blood type felt fine minus sore arm (1x pfizer, 1x moderna). Make will, get dang shot y'all! Took long enough. job. expect be. It’s coping mechanism lot people use feel better parenting skills.  It’s combination fantasy crap.

I call fantacrap! You’re right. flu vaccine years ago (I think 2018) effectiveness less 30%. years it’s really bad we’ve even seen fall 20%. It’s hardly ever 50%  Thank reply. numbers point a) helped understand better. think missing piece logic Healthcare provider asymptomatic low symptomatic COVID, vaccinated provider less likely spread COVID patients. 

It's binary ""you COVID spread it"", ""you might might spread COVID it.

And thank point b). absolutely agree seen incredible number people thought vaccination = immediate return normal. almost quite.

If seen Laurie Garrett's 2007 TED talk pandemics, educational. estimated 18-24 months based lot factors relevant today's pandemic. titled ""Lessons 1918 Flu Pandemic"". not. There's data suggest that. employees care anymore. support them; job police adult kindergartners. Remember said BLM protests would superspreader event?

Remember said Super Bowl would superspreader event?

Remember said baseball games would superspreader event?

Remember said Euro 2020 would superspreader event?

Seriously....we vaccines now. work great. can't get back things used now, we? practice saying s/t/u/p/I/d things come naturally? parents, grandparents, everyone else live with? Nah like 10 infections since report totally believable... live midsize Florida town 100,000 people. fully vaccinated rate sitting 40%. pockets liberals here, overwhelmingly red. People know left, right, center starting get covid -- vaxxed not. 

Our mayor seems like nice, level-headed dude. Throughout pandemic, encouraged mask mandates, social distancing, insisted virus real (pathetic part said, Florida, all). Even that, mayor's hands tied.

After shitshow 2020, thought running city commissioner. research city's government set up. Basically, mayor power city commissioners. Based Zoom meetings watched regarding mask mandates, city commissioners DUMB AF. So, mayor politely outspoken reality covid, city commissioners said nahhhh, city residents said nahhhh. nothing could do. 

I'm sure got death threats, too. listened call-ins residents commission meetings that's realized live Pawnee, Indiana Florida. Last heard, mayor running re-election, can't blame him. 

Tl;dr : Mayors cities Florida hold little power based city government set up. majority city commissioners country bumpkins, majority wins. Part article might find interesting:

""I would hoped delta things we've hearing last weeks, would went masks instead back track,"" Stack said.
Stack also said thought safeguards would put place Union Academy school lost teacher COVID-19 last year.
""When school position in, lost staff member, cases rising, think know focus keeping everyone safe healthy,"" Stack said."" Mention doctor next visit. way keep eye information too.

Been primary long learned condition seen me. condition walked recently- confirmed another specialist explaining it; heard it. 

The old adage trained see horses zebras true. admit too! 

So definitely mention doc, could nothing; still notated. 
Good luck. public option virtual all. private schools even person exclusively moment. much I'd like capable home schooling, option. 

Strange times i’d rather take small life detour keep fellow humans alive/healthy rather stuck living hell drags several years  Bummer That’s great news - delta hit Scotland? wonder delta follows typical pattern peaks (seems like does?) Still positive pcr, tested day 2 day 13. told doctor contagious, though? know even festival Forced testing definitely could legal. Compare breathalyzer tests. done states refuse take breathalyzer suspend driver's license period time. Something similar could done COVID tests.

Now significantly though US even seen capacity testing scale. take 50% context. Children hospitalized far lower rates COVID-19 adults, even small increases absolute number going show much higher percentages. also plummeting UK nobody really predicted either. Especially considering actually lifted restrictions cases surged vaccination rates high. effective vaccines well.

Delta cases India plummeted well without significant vaccination levels. seems kind own.

But know efficacy Chinese vaccine lower, vaccine hesitancy levels China 10 percent lower US, vaccines 10 percent less effective. Yeah LA 55% fully vaccinated. 60+ one dose. based vaccine ineffective infection you’d expect half cases vaccinated folks. fact 1/5 cases vaccinated despite vaccinated majority population means vaccine working. unfortunately worked trump though. Coronavirus cases surging San Francisco infections among adults aged 25 39 main driver increase.

  
In May, 25- 39-year-olds accounted 35% monthly new cases, July, they’re 50%. surge part general spike number coronavirus cases San Francisco, outpaced statewide infection rate.

  
“It’s perfect storm,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, professor medicine specializing infectious diseases UCSF.
 
 
That storm, said, mix relatively lower rate vaccination among age groups general tendency social, combined proliferation extra-contagious delta variant.
 
 
The delta variant began spreading like wildfire state soon state reopened June 15, eliminating relaxing virus-related restrictions. U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention recommending people wear masks indoors.
  
 
With variant, old precautions don’t work well, Chin-Hong said. “This less forgiving virus.”
  

The current monthly totals coronavirus cases among 25 39 age groups exceeded July 2020 levels, 1,400 new cases Friday, compared 1,200 last year.
  

“The people age group, 25 29 30 39, they’re moving around social well potentially work reasons,” doctor said.
  

The San Francisco Department Public Health also pointed relatively low vaccination rates among adults age groups likely reason high infection rates. city’s vaccination data shows adults aged 25 34 lowest rate eligible age group 72% least one dose 66% fully vaccinated.
  

“We know delta variant much likely infect spread unvaccinated, hence would expect case rates increase age group well,” department said statement.
  

Chin-Hong UCSF said may 25- 39-year-olds feel healthy invincible, otherwise reluctant get vaccinated, lower vaccination rate among population also explained fact older vulnerable people prioritized governments’ vaccination efforts.
  

Public health authorities trying catch up, often offering incentives, including cash prizes, people get vaccinated, mixed results, said. delta variant strong infectious is, may drastic measures, employers, bars restaurants requiring proof vaccination negative test results, many are.
  

“It’s super inconvenient keep tests time,” Chin-Hong said. “Some people might want it, would surprised people would want continue that, particularly like go hang friends bar setting.” reached highest daily case load seen US since early November. current rate combined possibility first people received vaccines immune starting wane shown early studies complete lack almost type current restrictions place could well go back beat that. Well account quite line up. see anybody selling COVID passports, may looking. entire security checkpoint dedicated checking vaccination/negative test proof understand would ""leave."" 

All said, verification person vaccination card, could really use copy anybody's. SMFH. need TRAIN immune system getting freaking vaccine! immune system job without training?! Tbey peaceful protest instead covid spread like Minneapolis something. selfless! need heroes like care kids!
🤢🤮🤗 Doesn’t make sense. open boarder letting Covid flow US complaint his. answer. coming Super Delta Fighter Turbo? Umm, completely mangling saying? second sentence suggests ""pulling up"".

Of course others pull bootstraps. awkward, potentially painful, done. would akin safety net.

But saying goes, cannot pull bootstraps. physically impossible, visualization ridiculous. I'd love able link numbers, find them? means period infected individual shedding virus shorter vaccinated. vaccine force field. virus enter body, vaccine cannot prevent that. 

It might able defeat virus quickly never realize arrived. quickly doesn’t qualify medical status “infected” (the way 99.8 “fever” medically).

But doesn’t stop virus entering body. I'm Fl. got heads weeks back nurse Baptist Hospital putting separate Covid ward complete refrigerated morgue trucks. keep telling others wear mask safe. get naysayers believe. They're seeing many pregnant women happen last time say. newborns testing positive too. hospital staff truly overwhelmed. unfair put due ignorance &amp; politics.  happened one I’m thinking too, except Michigan Family Dollar store security guard, cashier. shameful there’s enough events it’s confusing. counties Texas exceptionally well. work place believe 100% know people work direct can't complain zero alliance china say this; many people dead china would illogical. virus circulating much freely much much longer ever wuhan. first iteration virus wasn’t worst. 

Do think china honest everything? obviously not. honestly think trying control clamp shit got countries didn’t blamed fuck up. think least knowledge beginning, was, care it, hospitals overrun thay area, sure think probably decent amount people passed away. doesn’t logically make sense china would people dead here. I'm vaccinated I'm left center. wearing mask slow down. articles might scare unvaccinated finally getting it, otherwise really let run course people. try flatten curve little bit, longer drag better hospitals try save idiots (and anyone who, whatever reason, get vaccine breakthrough case). Wearing mask going grocery store something much ask. Remember US supplying countries Nigeria. think sent 80 million doses South America last month.

That said hopefully numbers. long take test negative symptoms? Currently stuck another country breakthrough case hoping I’ll get negative test 2 week window come home. mean, I'm going argue receiving free money, think likely, considering vaccine free distribution. anti vax people responsible mandate? They’ve clouded. Scumbags illegal things risk others isn’t anything new sadly, sure you’re ever going prevent kind thing. Everyone wants vaccine passports sadly situations happen it’s good get ever want live normal life sometimes bullying works antivax people need it. ""you never get odds exactly spot nobody else exactly like you"" straight dumb.

Its strictly speaking true.

That deosn't mean can't say things also true helpful: chance you, particular, dying covid, given 30 lower probability you, particular, dying covid 90.

But going able pull *specific* number truly claim ""This **my** probability dying covid."" 

There's probability generic 30-year-old type-1 diabetes dying Covid (It's 1.5%) approximate it. probability *you* dying Covid, given 30-year-old type-1 diabetes generic probability.

If want get super technical, probability dying covid either 0% 100%, either die Covid.

At best say ""for know I'm like average 30-year-old type-1 diabetes, rational credence place dying covid, given evidence, 1.5%"". know strictly speaking true.

This stupid take. result interpretations probability: belief virus plot Angry Pumpkin. Online education make gap WORSE vs. nots terms outcomes.  snappy comeback? things bad! Give employees cattle prods. Huh mean, literally nothing value 99% time. They're important doctors nurses. True. Although don’t see point mandate used 90 percent time, 90 percent actually time spend activity actually spreads covid. put one departing using restroom, activities known spread virus. Exactly! want see many c19 w/ vax die. Guess whose paying medical costs? yet heard anyone know express *any* sympathy forbearance anti-vax idiots. know I've talked idiots feel absolutely pity karma catches short hairs.

“Behold field grow fucks. Lay thine eyes upon see barren.”  - Hank Green (appropriate quote) thanks. favourite lewis quote yesterday ""at speed dangerous man"". Oh turn tables. Trust don’t 😞 Solid reasoning… Meanwhile Lollapalooza... afaik. couple 3M N95 masks pandemic sanding finishing woodwork. really comfy though tend get hot there, material wick away sweat pretty good. find one, give try see like it. don't, well still useful work generates lot dust want breathe in. anyone found link referenced report Julie Swann? searched find it. counties overlap reservations. surprising given terrible state healthcare reservations, sadly. That’s interesting, I’d think vaccine mandates work would make anti-vaxxers freak even before. One dose Pfizer offers protection J&amp;J double standard ridiculous understand you’re dying, damage done. It’s late antibodies point. (even stubborn ones). already US US already back normal, we're already ""Plan B.""

Masks never came 2009 flu pandemic. big deal this, really? expect? guess high spread COVID-19 part life forever something I'm willing accept. mean flippantly, possible I'm denial possible actually would get spread low long term. still possibility could reduce prevalence point fluke thing flares certain areas every instead major health crisis, would willing keep wearing masks another year longer make happen. can't accept idea world now. horrific. 

To point wearing masks 1) stop virus mutating something vaccine resistant, 2) protect children others can't get vaccinated yet, 3) protect pregnant people (like me) , immunocompromised people others still risk pretty serious complications outcomes (like preterm birth) even mild case, 4) protect people (including vaccinated people) permanent organ damage long covid, 5) stop hospitals getting overrun, 6) increase chances beating thing long term even vaccine uptake never gets high want be.

After everything went past 1.5 years I'm willing give surrender yet. still chance could beat thing back substantial way really really want miss chance. expect us get zero cases, surely huge spectrum zero cases currently seeing. things ate/tried eat COVID? experience bad tastes anything try COVID? Holy shit. Seek professional help. look states behind instead cherry picking. Masks never meant stop spread. helpful slowing spread. like vaccinations 100% effective help control spread. things life, nothing static, everything dynamic evolving (sorry believe evolution either), approaches, guidelines, everything changes. card date, vaccine serial number, location filled me. aren’t familiar region got vaccine, acronym used location (TRMC) means absolutely nothing. mostly true. need still vaccinated. Also seems like Vaccinated spread Delta, unlike variants. mutations work. Generally speaking, people get vaccines people want help countries anything. point still good one. Can't speak states definitely database received shots California. can’t eliminate COVID, spreads far efficiently far widespread population. possible February March 2020. now. long people overwhelmingly protected serious outcomes, there’s need inhibit lives breakthrough infections. teacher say mandate it. don’t want to? Don’t around kids. you? first vaccination 'religious' objection would huge red flag. got flu vaccine last year, better conversion experience since then... Got link reading then? Imagine ever ration Food water R8, median value assumed Delta, we're looking 3 months burn whomever still susceptible severe infection. Mask policy might prolong temporarily protecting unvaccinated wearing them. Vaccinations may cut month. fascinating CDC apparently believed announcing removal mask mandates vaccinated

Lots people (upvoted people) said months back. goal eliminate covid, avoid death. Jesus, nation adopted child-like mentality bad thing happen death? vaccinated friends can't breath right breakthrough cases would love question 'over' is. Mandate it, period. think uncle Jim lands ICU, start reconsidering… point getting vaccine die reduce spread Holidays pretty consistently overblown regard covid spread. Every time holiday event (like superbowl) comes goes, set people sub whining going cause spike. They've wrong least often they've right, often. 

July 4 2020 really anything, way. Cases already sky high time July 4 rolled around, fact within two weeks (which standard amount lag time expect see events reflected metrics) wave peaked started fall. 4th July spike. high-level executives. still required employees actually work stores, mandate practically useless. largest decrease hesitancy January May education group high school education less. Hesitancy held constant educated group (those Ph.D.); May Ph.D.’s hesitant group. Lol shut Honestly, point, I've given vaccines (I'm vaccinated).

The latest CDC study demonstrating 70+% vaccinated still infected exposed virus, thereby also contagious, really concerns me.

The early lab results showing Lambda completely vaccine resistant even concerning.

Don't quote either please fix stats updated information based reading last night, I'm locking back down. people behave masks pandemic, zero hope we'll get grip climate change. would absolutely shocked Cobb even remotely mandated masks. school board insanely corrupt families half insane. One friends got beginning March 2020. still can't taste. eats food texture resistance deadly disease? feel like hear xyz region may achieved herd immunity least week.

I still remember Ran Paul said back October 2020 NYC achieved herd immunity. Sadly much vaccine mandate happen, already teaching shortage many school cant come close filling positions. Many teachers NY already uncertified. couldnt replace leave. sucks, NY making decision (this coming vaccinated teacher) Worst case scenario? vaccines rolled around already 4,000 deaths per day climbing topping 250-300k known cases day. Projecting. K pal. Israel offering 3rd doses 60+  God sure hope man. tired living fear. got cold day anxiety literally worst it. several negative COVID tests. Oh hey look, county. remember back recent MIT study great deal vaccine hesitant ""highly informed"" reading primary research form opinions. people might spreading hesitancy giving people misguided fear vaccines, bolstered veneer scientific legitimacy. 
Ironically, study (the MIT) one used ""scientifically literate"" justify vaccine hesitancy. weaponizing knowledge harmful purpose.

Maybe scientific publishers could better job curating available general public. everybody needs know everything. help vaccine advocacy, could information needs go poison cabinet worst behind us. thought. US isn’t example western democracy nobody claiming system (or anyone else’s perfect). tradeoffs authoritarianism democracy, personally tell lived systems authoritarianism worth - pandemic not. said it, didn't. get flu shot every year anyway. don’t loss taste smell number cases, believe percentages suffice. problem indeed partially vaccinated, believe many time. Although rare, still catch measles vaccination: I’m wondering majority unvaccinated one-shotters aren’t anti-Vax crazies, indifferent lazy individuals. I’ve spoken people won’t get vaccine to, becomes convenient to. American, neither I. mean, know why, understand condone callousness. BS xenophobia hatred. I'm sickened country. Local pharmacies payed €60 per shot govt anybody downvote beyond  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis resisted mandatory mask mandates vaccine requirements, along state Legislature, limited local officials’ ability impose restrictions meant stop spread COVID-19. lot doses needed quickly want stop virus mutating something evades vaccines altogether. Eventually they're going start quitting / calling sick

I mean happening entire pandemic already. going go another phase. may end happening hospitals means end poaching medical staff areas can't pay much. That’s really good information here, good news go it.

The bad news become apparent- antibodies wane, fully vaxxed people get infected time, 60 immune compromised likely need boosters. expected, though- antibodies almost always wane, memory cells, seems robust- relied heavy lifting. 

There’s really good news article, though. It’s becoming apparent vaccines indeed reduce Aires even someone infected:

""We saw 80 percent vaccinated individuals become confirmed cases zero contact confirmed cases, 10 percent one contact confirmed cases,"" said, adding ""their ability infect others 50 percent lower vaccinated.""

‘She noted spread among household contacts, risk confirmed cases vaccinated individuals infecting others 10 percent risk infecting one individual lower 10 percent.’

This it’s imperative hit high vaccination threshold, that, community level- take steam COVID. Even Mass. study cited CDC showed even perfect conditions virus thrive (poorly vented areas massive amount people crammed together drinking yelling; thousands upon thousands people, actually)- may cause outbreak, outbreak put control community due high vaxx levels community. important note- three conditions presented self difference every one unvaccinated, you’re likely seeing beginning surge community + way people infected severe symptoms. You’re responding different point. comment thread you’re regarding breakthrough case rarity breakthrough case severity. issue CDC made seem like breakthroughs categorically rare, increasing evidence showing isn’t rare initially said. Severity separate issue. Modena BioNTech rather similar, I’m sure mixing lead improved immunity. Genetic component?

Nope. 

I'm guessing mainly two things. One under-reporting cases due lack available testing. factor many countries Africa young populations (large % people age 40). Take, example, Nigeria (one populous countries Africa). population ages 0-14, age group seriously impacted Covid-19 (yet, anyway). lot people age 65, demographic overwhelmingly impacted Covid-19, going see large amounts (visible) Covid testing lot going see high case numbers (obviously) many Covid cases asymptomatic resemble common cold begin with. country always acting response virus. proactively. retrospect, think mistake didn’t make public service commercials showed real people stomachs, intubated, induced comas voiceovers family members talking scared were. 

""But person old/fat/black/had health problems/isn't immortal like am!"" Yes. vaccinated since January/March. I’m boat, supposed get J&amp;J back months ago adverse effects scared away. think it’s time send Shocking.  watch crowd champions employment laws turns 180 degrees laws used terminate employment. Wake *New Delta+ Knuckles* comes out. I’m position. don’t think COVID big deal vaccine isn’t necessary. governor encouraged this. job requiring unvaccinated employees get tested job site twice week. Indefinitely. vaccinated employees allowed unmask desk 6 feet away, unvaccinated keep on. symptom checker daily, even weekends. Well you’re vaccinated there’s much do. I’m sure crowd mostly vaccinated. change fact sat cafeteria less 10 people vaccinations small town Oregon talked nurses fact literally nobody getting vaccinated live. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ I'm young guy, part.  saw article, think yesterday, Lightfoot delaying restrictions concert. Possibly misinformation, would shocking learn… point kind fair complain masks vaccinated. courage.... :( disruptive. business China things moving moment. huge queues Chinese ports example. Port congestion 5 year high. That’s pretty disruptive considering last year. strikes odd although industry newsletters disruptions see them, mainstream media doesn’t talk them. hearsay would need basis reality first merit “disproven”. 

All wishing Chinese people would die feel less bad 600k dead Americans isn’t healthy all. It’s 100% politics frankly it’s sad. US divided right along political lines unfortunately mask-wearing vaccinations swept that. / husband vaccinated? could get 11 approved, total population vaccinated go even None! I’ve bloodwork done every six months generally Covid happened everything’s fine  NGL someone bit skeptical places could get vaccine area. soon saw Delta tearing shit knew needed immediately get doses. Here: list including grants Narodowy Instytut Wolności (i.e. Gliński himself/by cronies) ""Stowarzyszenie RKW Ruch Kontroli Wyborów - Ruch Kontroli Władzy"".

And pieces disgusting antivaxx nonsense published organisation:

* ""government supporting antivaxxers financially"" must living 2 different realities.  is. 

But kids already lost 1.5 years appropriate education. 1.5 years normal social interaction. Many lost best source nutrition. source exercise. 

I understand parents get emotional ignore actual data. Personally, know data would rather take chances COVID let kids go back normal school. nothing anecdote. *you* can't name anyone vaccinated mean exist. Perhaps claim 98% 200 people interact regularly *are* vaccinated. refute anecdote? No, another anecdote. Additionally, correct I'm wrong, self-reported numbers, choose lie vaccinated skew result. mean know vaccines healing effects describtions general result placebo effect. know stress cause temporary dementia (commonly seen PTSD victims), might that? major part. That's point.

And vaccination end goal. Virtually measures prevent spread attacked start mainly Republicans.

Like wanna vaccinated instead decide leave house always wear mask public definitely different squealing freedom getting vaccine dying covid internet means information, necessarily better information. Good call. Novovax, hasn’t debuted countries yet.. going come Australia second half year. going linchpin Australia’s vaccination strategy. Novovax told won’t delivering 2022.

I’m really confident Novovax delivering US time soon I'm tempted get 3rd shot according data Also Delta swinging people fence sitters high gear created status quo ""either get vaccinated ass kicked around Covid, choice""

Anecdotally, know people waiting year see (ya know, letting everyone else take risk thought vaccine hesitant get benefit from...). many gotten vaccinated going delta. Well couple articles read suggest loss smell doesn’t cause permanent damage, something worried about. Sounds like covid reinfection mild vaccine? immunize prevent getting spreading disease vaccinated also leads death long term complications non-insubstantial segment population pretty shitty vaccine. vaccinated yet, keep mind ""decide time"" whole process going take least month 2 shot regimen. Yeah, sterilizing immunity one golden bullet hoping vaccines might deliver. 
It stinks didn’t, still amazing. 
Maybe ignorant topic ever even hoped sterilizing immunity possibility though. find fascinating differently overall McDonalds run US UK, like think ever stopped masks even though legally to, literally closed Mcdonalds height pandemic guarantee worker safety retail workers seen pretty good employers pay reasonably well. terrifying. 2 years ago stories would stop people tracks; hospitals across entire regions declaring code black, morgue freezer trucks getting ready overflowing bodies, virus spreading like wildfire among populations seemingly care anymore...
 
The correct reaction calm, measured prevention. Work fellow humans stop thing hitting 10 million deaths best way possible. First Astrazeneca, Biontech. really bad me, although Astrazeneca bit worse (6 days feeling extremely sick instead 3). really depends vaccines get :D Oh 100% go forward State Fair. got enough shit last year even justified. dumb-ass coming 5th dose, willing lie get it, that's bud. 

Well, there's tendancy people hypochondriac tendancies think they're doctors. going big problem 10% country lies get third fourth booster skews numbers. Plus, J&amp;J people getting boosters.... actually kind support, J&amp;J held Delta, CDC still making call J&amp;J boosters that's causing even conflict. mean like NYC last year w/ OG hoping refrigerator trucks full dead bodies sitting parking lots break like India months ago Delta first emerged fishing hundreds dead bodies Ganges? Yes beat stock market even better. totally aware isn’t economy, say pretty good idea consequences covid reactions are.

And yes, taking consideration supply chain disruptions. kind asked rhetorical question: “why would happen?” disruptions. think caused virus itself? measures implemented intended attempt slow spread virus? really valid point anymore. mRNA vaccines certified fridge storage 30 days, even longer standard freezer temperatures. whole -80C requirement thrown window months ago. Ok what. Take new vaccine ?

Then masks right seem explain state declined I'm wondering expect state bring medical staff quick enough handle wave.  need number cases vaccinated/unvaccinated compare hospitalization rates. unvaccinated also likely wear mask go life normal, much higher chance getting Covid. think I’m gonna goPfizer

The warning thing CVS’ website fir appointment scary though. Myocarditis pericarditis possibilities, hope it’s rare. Florida’s peak going happen week. hospital work cancelled elective surgeries, we’ve opened available units covid filling fast. weeks peak. Lots otherwise well meaning otherwise ignorant / unintelligent people certainly did. 
I lot conversations family member “no” ok fraternize unvaccinated people fully vaccinated. 
Before Delta, sure multiple vaccinated people could get together relative safety. 
At point anyone think roll dice near antivaxxers though. There’s quite people don’t like/hate Abbott sides. Especially freeze happened. CDC seem politically influenced properly effective. mask thing issue US? wear that’s that. big problem Another reason get vaccinated try stay safe possible. studies type effects come out. new know long term implications could be.  100% Personally, covid unavoidable (which not, many vaccinated people get it), would greatly prefer delaying getting covid (or several) effective treatments, long-covid effects well understood preventable curable hospitals far overstressed overcapacity full burned medical staff.

Be nice get healthcare reform first, too, like mandated sick time sensible medical billing. that’s likely country.

Delaying good. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Considering US's healthcare system entirely for-profit, think people would willing get vaccine risk financial ruin. somehow, conspiracy theories carry weight. people replying Europe? I'm talking McDonald's America. Ireland, see lots families hangout McDonalds, felt strange, US, eat leave, may talk, never consider place hangout. think different associations Europeans. test tell. Lots illnesses there.

Any loss taste smell? Thats big covid flag May ask pre-conditions either affect immune system make vulnerable COVID? Well, depends. basically everyone gets school starts, won’t necessarily come back. deaths going up? Otherwise 70% population vaccinated. Cases matter. What's Africa, low case counts? India Nepal seems rip go dormant. Nothing like say Peru, Brazil America control last 18 months.

Genetic component? beyond idiotic massive oversight lol. know, there's hypochondriac gets new vaccine every two weeks. We'll probably see news story ""man dies vaccine overdose"" October lol. 2021 could've stupidly easy set shifty database providers report to. US 70% atleast one shot vaccinated. 90% vulnerable population vaccinated. Even witb cases going up, deaths point vaccine. sub Pfizer-heavy, bother arguing here. They'll figure short-lived immunity Pfizer soon, Israel, Massachusetts Iceland. second dose due August 28th! let's get herd immunity help neighbors! sound like COVID?

So family (12 people) recently (Mid July) family reunion Fortaleza, CE, Brazil (relatively low case rate-8/daily per 100k) , 4 us coming DC area, 4 coming São Paulo, 3 Florianopolis, 1 locally Fortaleza. adults group kids US(7 us) fully vaccinated, different vaccines (4 pfizer, 2 Astrazeneca, 1 Coronavac/Sinovac), 2 adults partially vaccinated (1 pfizer, 1 AstraZeneca), 3 others 13-15 yo range, young vaccinated Brazil.

During trip, mostly went beach, though 5 us go waterpark once, another 4 ate indoors one point.

Upon returning home, exact symptoms (light cough, runny nose, sore throat) intensity, medium-strength cold, part thought uncharacteristic COVID, huge variations vaccination status age found within group (ranged 12-74), would think intensity would vary more, no, 12 us got it, got same, also people family blood(in-laws), know diff would make. Perhaps something consumed, different bug, know.

Anyways, got PCR test yesterday results come tomorrow morning, since stay home anyways, wondering reddit's guess whether COVID not. let know pans results come out. going popular here, but...

**I'm going blame fully vaccinated people deciding attend Lollapalooza.**

We different spot last year.

270,000 Americans died covid 2021 1,300 vaccinated. fewer 6,300 vaccinated hospitalizations.

The risk vaccinated large.

For record, every eligible person vaccinated, disease would unable spread Rt would less 1. would lead cascade cases, vaccine effective slowing spread (even delta).

On one hand, it’s great thing, particularly given horrendous outbreaks processing plants past year half

[Bob - Head UCSF Department Medicine

[Ben - White House Covid Response Team

Finally, Leana Wen, great job describing [Washington Post fact vaccinated sometimes spread disease mostly relevant people live elderly, children, immunocompromised.  Evidence? ^(well suffer selfish took hospital beds.) makings amazing archeological discovery centuries now. 

""Many theories proposed, scientists still know 21st century man left caches recreational intoxicants along stretch aeroway believe bustling waterfront field cultivated grasses."" &lt;shows artist's rendition rivers parks used look Oh deer! That’s good…or bad? I’m sure. accept part lives delta variant got bad did. Soon enough multiple variants could potentially worse delta vaccine able help protect against. yeah go music festivals, concerts, theme parks, whatever. got accept potentially hundreds thousands/millions people gonna die every year something mostly preventable.  


Because every one trying safe tens hundreds people give flying fuck protections, masks, etc.  


Whole point vaccination safety others. Going crowded place negates that, especially evidence asymptomatic spread delta others whether vaccinated not. Currently everybody super lax carefree covid, unfortunately change soon, especially variant develops negates vaccine entirely. usually first shot second, both. 

It's usually neither.

But yeah, minority cases bad reaction occurs, usually one other. overwhelming majority currently hospitalized people region African-American despite around 15% population. %-wise, anti-vax sentiment actually higher among African-Americans among white conservatives. Risk cumulative. everyone vaccinated risk getting virus goes significantly.  Sure, unvaccinated knew risks, made choice. there's subtle reason able articulate--fear mortality. acknowledging life-threatening virus world, makes think finite lifespan, like that. Aren’t vaccinated negative test? masks though. One state dozen outlier. People want work want get sick get others sick. US 3 weeks-ish (based UK data) wave last least 8-9 weeks. (and that's better vaccinated UK time Delta wave). Florida example already record hospitalizations entire pandemic (daily total). Imagine go 5x? We'll see. Hope right, watching Delta explode restricted heavily vaccinated population shocking last two months.  also less likely get it. breakthrough cases like once-in-a-million rare thing, still rather uncommon. especially everyone vaccinated risk reduces dramatically. Risk cumulative. majority people taken it- read recently 70% least one shot I'm pro-vaccine policy would make sense public transportation forcing private businesses participate gross. we're never going go outside Covid exists now? stay mean stay inside entire lives delta infection always carry risk long-term side effects? get mild symptoms, still get organ damage loss grey matter, etc? significant effects accompany ICU-level infections? one links info reading this?

Could benefit getting delta antibodies preparation next variant pops up? people exposed CoVid multiple times ultimately fare better people wait get first exposure later, vaccine-resistant variant?

My kids looking going back precautions school. state governor unhelpful. I'm vaccinated. I'm guessing under-12 kids likely get delta go back in-person, even wearing masks.

Is better hunker kids get vaccine get delta since exposed sometime anyway, possibly worse variant, later on? stance need mandate vaccines anything public.

If want save lives, way it. unvaccinated overwhelmingly putting everyone risk. also easy way protect themselves. also protects people cannot get vaccine.

If going that, everything else pointless. lift restrictions, cases surge. matter low starting from, that's exponential growth works. try counter ""contact tracing"" anti-vax community make sure never happens either. exactly fantastic this, either. Plus, China's heavy-handed influence arguably one contributing factors got control way did. No. want protect kids every possible danger, better let anything sit rooms nothing rest lives. kid way likely die form whole bunch stuff. risk COVID kids minimal. Every time take kid school risking getting hit car dying. catching flu. falling swing set breaking neck. puncturing eye stray piece metal. whole host things. Sheltering kid disease dangerous hurts socially. friends hanging out, making memories, socializing, sports, OP's kid sitting home. Especially formative age, developing social skills massively important. OP kid disservice pulling disease 99.99% survival rate children. Especially COVID kid could die get hurt easily. OP falling scare mongering. Everything appointment around one scheduled earliest time available tomorrow. Sorry, seeing ""thousands?""  saw dozen breech inner gate still able get way in. office US reopened mid July closed back work remote Labor Day. Surely shit still going hitting fan months time, yeah?? 🤦‍♂️ lot international students visa/travel issues may even first week classes…a lot people arrive two weeks early make first day, due quarantine. can’t get first dose complete quarantine— it’s instant protection.

Again, VACCINES AVAILABLE EVERYONE YET. live one countries world free easy access. It’s like places. Even still seven week gaps doses, many younger people getting second doses. much better many many places.

We seeing delta outbreaks pockets under-vaccinated people, younger people (like university age students) lower vaccination rates. Combine fact many international students still struggling/waiting vaccines, it’s obvious 70%+ full vaccination rate first month. don’t vaccine requirement students won’t ever bother.

We absolutely “the oppressive measures” province. varies like varies state state. K-12 schools fully open year, indoor dining closed briefly found major source spread, masking past winter… we’ve less restrictive many US states, lol.  This.

The ""vaccines magic Covid personally"" people almost bad anti-vaxxers. can’t handle truth.  gives shit? 

If vaccine care? call reaction good thing. indicator vaccine working, absence reaction indicator working. wonder impact family centric events/establishments children cant get vaccinated. Nobody 12 join parents lunch, go indoor sporting event? would hope would allowed masked. People vaccinated still getting it, there's still evidence they're spreading levels get extremely low compared unvaccinated population.

When there's 130k+ cases day I'm sure we're going mitigate people getting vaccinated catching probably way point. protests didn’t won’t either. know today done WW2 racist. also know current SCOTUS would happen. Nah, watched live stream too. Lolla much drive us, dont really like city-festivals. We'll Bonnaroo Sept theres rumors LB replacing Deftones dropped couple months ago. fence Bizkit, I'm pretty sold idea. show looked like blast. someone grew New York City spent rest life Hawaii west coast university towns, sympathize. idea hell going country leave bubble.

It's definitely twilight zone territory. China always advantage kinds situations. authoritarian response works, people support Party measures needs take. 

Lives certainly ""disrupted"" likely killed defiance, lives saved result. Hard capitalist brains understand, rather popular among Chinese nationals. really close due electoral college works. 

Biden GA, AZ, WI less 1% margin. Trump states, EC would've tied 269 each. next closest state PA Biden 1.16% margin. Trump too, would've whole thing.  
So 1% less margin across 4 states difference. Trump 2016.

Out 158M votes cast, 42,918 votes difference outright Biden win EC tie. 

so yes, close. spread Covid even vaccinated completely asymptomatic. recent CDC recommendations changed universal masking - Vaccinations preventing infection, sickness. Vaccinated individuals still propagating virus. Chinese Government total absolute control population. Earlier pandemic welding people's door shut living neighborhood someone infected. Mandatory citywide tests nothing. normal Tuesday CCP.

And something celebrate. ""medicine,"" case complete totalitarianism, far, far worse disease. I’m San Diego it’s normal too. I’m looking big picture though. sisters wedding Chicago next month, international travel etc. stuff normally wouldn’t worry concerns. normal life. one required work city Denver see ""forced."" Ron Deshankis again.

Jealous Cuomo killing elderly last year. know many music festivals occurring weekly basis world? numbers regular Covid. Delta far contagious. governor banning mask-wearing requiring vaccination, surprise? course. standard flu changes period many women! known? Unvaccinated seniors Florida terrified point. Yeah, 20% baseline chances getting unvaccinated, still low-ish number. 
Also official trials pretty safe assume general population vaccinated yet. vaccine rolled many areas starting experience benefits community protection. Herd immunity magic condition flips like switch; slowly built to. Thanks, interesting. quite understand first report is: 

*In total, 2.6% healthcare workers breakthrough COVID-19 infections, 67% mild 33% asymptomatic.* later *Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 weeks.*

That can't group people, would anyone classify cases ""mild""? second group unvaccinated?

But anyways, Alpha, dealing Delta. That's great article. Thanks sharing. understood it'll denied ""let gawd figger ouwt!"" crowd gives peace mind. Username doesn’t check Inappropriatebot people idiots? Strange wait data support available since clinical trial. really worrying considering huge shortage chips electronics we're already facing. Disruptions last year caused ripple effects really felt badly months ago - companies unable expand data centers, new vehicle shortages, startups going can't source parts. there's another disruption now, start really hurt next year? thought would link useful information… school reached 60%. near 40% mask mandates lifted. many teachers NY oppose vaccines won't, stop fear mongering hysteria. Great job! Thank you!! Unreal. Thank everything doing. 6587 number deaths hospitalizations. number fully vaccinated died closer quarter that, 1600. I'll point recently several articles studies different sources mutually disagree other. could speculate is...but that's really useful.

Don't know people getting different results clear yet settled science. Please ask doctor want clarify something CDC site may want discuss considers history following contraindication vaccination COVID-19 vaccines:

  Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) previous dose component COVID-19 vaccine
  Immediate allergic reaction severity previous dose known (diagnosed) allergy component vaccine

PEG polysorbate structurally related, cross-reactive hypersensitivity compounds may occur. People contraindication one mRNA COVID-19 vaccines receive doses either mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna). However, people contraindication mRNA COVID-19 vaccines may able receive Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, vice versa, provided certain measures taken (see “precautions” below). Known polysorbate allergy longer contraindication mRNA vaccination; however, known polysorbate allergy contraindication Janssen COVID-19 vaccine thus, precaution mRNA COVID-19 vaccination.

What’s you’re described exactly imagine. problem cannot replace positions. school already 30 people understaffed. teacher shortage many areas really bad. Ideally right alternative classrooms 40+ kids ignoring IEPs. super super bad around seasonal factor play here. summer Florida, people hiding air-conditioning (and breathing common air). normal years, states north would outdoors, winter comfortable. I'm predicting anything, bears watching seasons change. don’t know issue is? pre-vaccine, certainly headlines. happens CA NY, headline news too. doubt fall/winter spikes places happened before... hopefully high vax rates limit hospitalizations deaths. provider could re-issue card, big deal.

I forgot card 2nd shot (because nobody told bring it) gave another card, copying information 1st card 2nd. No? calculate statistical probability happening you’d like, also uncommon anywhere near uncommon claiming symptomatic breakthroughs be.

It is, however, bedrock tenet legal system going far back English common law 1300s. need time machine. Near Philly. Thry went lomgwood gardens saw another garden near hershey redditors gotta feel superior somehow Also long Covid thing

Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 page 11 report. log odds confidence interval long Covid (after two shots) goes .4:1 nearly 1:1. Meaning risk long Covid hard pin fully vaccinated could help substantially slightly reduce risk reading mixing vaccines people thinks could good call. I'm curious see happens what's happening Delta Variant. 

I work hospital records visit ICU daily basis right worst since spike last summer. Monday told 68 patients Covid. 

That's worrying. much event, Delta starting get people. way. Make proof vaccination mandatory treated hospital COVID unless exempt legit reason (age, compromised immune system disease chemo). refuse vaccine decided burden healthcare system treating you. Long covid kids. 72 hour negative test pretty worthless. exposed Sunday, got tested Monday results Tuesday negative. developing symptoms Tuesday knew getting sick considering everything, certain Covid. Tested Wednesday results Thursday positive. human event doesn’t mutate virus

This implied. Human behavior leads increase transmission, increase transmission leads chance mutation. Children exempt requirement. younger age 12 excluded venues eligible vaccinated, said. details plans remain worked out. “We figure things safe manner,” mayor said. See flaws logic reasoning. way smarter people giving orders. proud mention flaws many. incredibly slippery slope 

not particularly. regulate private businesses time. enjoy rat feces food? Yea... “just two weeks flatten curve guys” Either impose identification requirements can’t. It’s situational. We’re talking requiring ID every 2 years voting every fucking day vax pass. Pull head chief, you’re suffocating. keep told worry, breakthroughs rare, get story like every day now, CDC recorded 'mild' cases. Nothing adding up, we're expected pretend everything fine even though there's also evidence vaccinated safe long covid. Thank info.


Last year, reports strange/aggressive rodents. supposedly food shortage due lock (and restaurant closing).


But deer, aggressive, acting recognize human. riding back mass transit enclosed spaces big issue. electoral base dying What’s end game? Like benefit risking lives voters? really don’t get it.  Wtf covid fatalist? Don’t Fauci Florida. remember baseball stadiums went back full capacity Reddit told would huge super spreader events, surges months Yeah. event currently happening, one going get tested immediately it. case many covid cases. usually follow 2 weeks actual event people get it.

We talk becomes less hypothetical, unvaccinated disproportionately young far less likely need hospitalization. nutjob made fringe issue

It's actually used political FUD device long, long time now. Longer us alive even, new topic least. going trace people contact halls 1700 student school?

Are students allowed cell phones days? I'm far old childless know cell phones possible this.

Vaccinated people *who infected* similar Ct values unvaccinated people. vaccine good preventing infections *and* vaccinated people infected clear virus rapidly likely infectious less time.

Finally, Leana Wen, great job describing [Washington Post fact vaccinated sometimes spread disease mostly relevant people live elderly, children, immunocompromised. ""Lollapalooza 2021: SuperSpreaders"" news, water: wet. whole point vaccine allow us resume normal life.

We get decide neither scientists made vaccine; *the virus* decides whether vaxxed people resume normal life. Given CDC's recommendation mask mandates vaxxed individuals, things anything back normal vaccinated. Based current data, vaccine protect disease necessarily stop transmitting virus others. 1. Vaccines still highly effective preventing severe cases death
2. vaccinated unvaccinated spread virus, vaccine passport isn’t going fix anything 
3. narrative needs switch blaming unvaccinated everything, I’m disgusted quick we’re able blame group people Delta surge — even family said questionable things (we’re vaccinated)  question what’s front you, sudden focus drawn line behind slowly getting agitated, look colleagues pushing one other, look standard glance “wtf keep line moving”. look back certificate front you, it’s clearly fake line stops see man 3 people back, he’s shouting something, can’t work he’s clearly worked up, looking confrontation, look back fake certificate, hear boss shout name, wave through. look watch, barely minute passed, look queue thousands sigh heavily. 70% eligible, really meaningless political way looking it. virus going entire population, fully vaccinated percentage population one matters around 50%. Cause money DUH GUBMENT COMIN US, HIDE CLETUS HIDE! I’d like go you, optimists right often last 18 months. Mobile app uses blockchain technology can’t faked get card reissued doctor/ whoever medical record lose it.

as faking however....I think there's good answer moment. card originally meant serve record treatment individual used identification. wish use identification think best course would actually issue cards meant used identification, would contain forge-proof elements. Fourth Amendment grounds won’t be—there’s violation there. seems lost concept North Texas 113% covid hospitalizations month ago.

Like yes, Vaccines appear less effective general infection Delta strain, time deaths hospitalizations considerably lower year ago despite us 21k cases.

Hospitalizations| 46,776 | 39,580 | -7,196

So 7 day average Cases 134%, despite Hospitalizations 16%, deaths 70%. things bad seem think are, like still 2020, we'd looking 62,740ish Hospitalizations 1,600ish deaths.

ftfy Sure do. reminder arrogant entitled citizens think set stop date virus attention span lapsed need new shiny makes us happy again. Florida population: 21.6 million per Google.

10.5 million fully vaxxed per covidactnow.org

So leaves 11.1 million people potentially vulnerable. Even subtract everyone caught last year (which can’t, lot folks catch Covid go vaccinated), huge number possible Delta cases wandering around without sort protection. 50% vaxxed nowhere near enough highly populated area.

As far weather goes, Delta doesn’t appear particularly seasonal. India’s Delta wave hit height summer driven predominantly outdoor festivals outdoor political rallies.

Quite opposite, typically safer outside vs. indoors. would imagine heavy smokers, vaccinated would hard time pneumonia due amount damage lungs. Draconian law. It’s truly sad day...But bet people excited “mUH hEaLtH sAfEtY.” vaccine works, leave others alone. Stop coercing businesses able serve others. number people hospitalized COVID-19 Florida rose all-time high 11,515 patients one day,


I wonder many school age True Florida 55 determine elections, vote Republican. He's betting net result status quo voter turn out, enough people survive getting covid next year people short memories. Also core support Republicans always vote (R) even R dangerous personally. Absolutely. We’ve vaxxed since February - March sold 12,000 person / day phish shows. place blame rising cases unvaxxed. Vaxxed libs part, get party now. literally don’t care get spread anymore, done caring since 30-35% America decided want it. Billions people also aren’t contacting covid positive patients regular basis like do. Well many liberals like say abortions stuff; body, choice. vaccinated, respect don’t wanna inject experimental vaccination hasn’t even approved yet. reason would let stop masking distancing virus 99.9% survival rate. Clearly lying said going back normal 4th July, they’re bringing back restrictions many places, regardless vaccination status. Therefore, what’s point getting vaccinated you’re still gonna make us play dress brain surgeons public? Good point. problem mayor kept beaches closed last summer, shut pedestrian/bike paths outdoor playgrounds chained shut like 4 months ago. 

Apparently outdoor transmission occurs places can’t financially politically benefit from. idea. saw mentioned NY digital passes paper cards happened wife. period 3 weeks straight first dose. called anxiety. wasn't. I'm pro-vaxx, look this. Rules enforced. mostly talk bite. guess guys already herd working immunity. MegaCon Orlando geek con 100,000 people showing inside. goes 8/12-8/15. temp checks say require masks talk happens take con. con always packed. likelihood getting sick con pre pandemic high. First all, attendees need vaxxed. Second, pretty much every epidemiologist planet said zero COVID impossible long time. COVID stay nothing young people getting outside attending music festival. Stop shaming people moving lives. That’s point… FL definitely little bit strange outlier.

Its even like blame highly unvaccinated areas either. 

Miami Dade County vaccination numbers match highest states, yet still sitting 82 cases per 100k. appear vaccines still holding tho, 96% hospitalizations completely unvaccinated (other 4% mix fully, partial unknown) I’m shocked stand honest guy like DeSantis would lie blatantly incompetently. 

Shocked. Indeed risk event itself, travels after...

Which enduring issue whole last year. Like people Outdoor weddings people fly stay hotels reception indoor setting. Yeah, said vows outside that's great nobody attended actually outdoors. Cool I'm going wear one Good quality journalists deserve paid. IDK, there's average 30K people packed baseball stadiums nightly, across country. We've heard nothing spikes games. Lollapalooza getting hate really think we're going see massive increase cases like media seems hoping for. completely skipped month second dose, I’m extremely regular. Reported gyno annual didn’t seem surprised. coworker wife also extremely delayed second shot. 20.5% vaccinated Americans hospitalized COVID symptoms died based CDC data. Probably skewed elderly deaths, 99.999% stat going change worse another gaffe. ask doctor J&amp;J given family history? population density significant factor total population? got vaccine. wear mask. I’m healthy. me. won’t commission weeks breakthrough lol Private sector chipping away, need get serious. mean? Lol. That's bad honestly better one two mistakes (underestinate vs overestimate vaccination rate). area, 80% Teachers we're vaccinated within 6 weeks initial eligibility them. since then, many others medical exemptions. That's despite living area low vaccine rate rates lot abtivax types. even area would expect resistance, Teachers overwhelmingly favor vaccines.

In words, think Union, like many state local governments, favoring loud majority, properly representing people serve way should. makes total sense. remaining unvaccinated people going motivated move position experience direct impact virus. value collective, value individualism. 

They morality activates care instinct care someone anti vax usually displaced sense liberty direct family friends threatened. Yesterday 10% increase previous Monday, hopefully trend Rt continues cases drop.

Will interesting see lower vaccination rate quickly wave comes down. heroes born way forged life experiences? 

Not heroes wear caps, may one back closet cosplay. That’s true, we’ve already required fill reports enter gym. Delta originate India? vaccinated people majority infected hospitalized patients now? would high vaccination rate vaccine prevent infection spread Delta variant stop this? get 3rd shot moral? literally throwing unused doses away, it’s available anyone wants it. ones danger refuse get vaccinated can’t irresponsible.

Again, Great news! Hope see jurisdictions follow DeBlasio’s lead.

We need push airlines enact mandate. question vaccinations skyrocket mandates ramp up. go Lollapalooza either show proof vaccination recent negative covid test, otherwise getting in.

Yes, people tired antiVa antiMa wanting part society wanting follow simple basic rules.


We wear masks, get vaccinated, need get society back running. antiMa antiVa crowd complains expected give shit society demand apart of.



If antiVa antiMa scared masks shots stay home. Well, that’s works here. Students arrive must immediately quarantine two weeks. Travel difficult right there’s still ban place countries, delaying students further. won’t able get first dose first week class, that’s late much good consider one dose little delta dose *any* vaccine needs two weeks much all. 

Masks might ideal assure “communication channel” online classes far worse, we’re already outbreaks parts province vaccination rate low. That’s Anne-vaxxers lazy people didn’t wanna get them, due supply.

It won’t surprising thing happens campus one really don’t want classes canceled thrown back online prof/too many students sick once. McDonalds: Please wear mask coming in. Also, feel free take mask anyways decide eat here.

I get half measures. pure lip service.  Dont need inject political influence . People everywhere seriously underestimating antivaxx pandemic operating . CDC mask mandate? Really? WSJ, fact ever matter you? Thank you! get hopes up. need measure anything short hospitalizations/deaths means prevalence especially breakthrough infections much protection gives long covid-19

I mean even vaccines, probability ""low"" severe outcome anyways (hospital death), great vaccines protect know there's also long term (or med term) significant effects covid19 send hospital . 

So much protection vaccines give much likely outcome (and prevalence) getting covid19 symptoms majority people (and vaccination status)? Lol break state im LOT less worried.

Yesterday Cuomo putting pressure private businesses require comprehensive breakdown I've read yet. Even could understand thank it! But, I'm still going demand employer continue allow me, 57 immunocompromised, work home. Unless chance getting virus 0, I'm going continue keep vaxxed ass home. Remember that's 160 million people span 6 months We’ve hearing tons events lately didn’t really see massive surges. didn’t go, personally, tickets went sale point looked really promising would safe point summer. 

I’m bit torn know *could* bad situation next couple weeks Illinois decent vaccination rate I’m hopeful numbers stay pretty stable. Time tell vaccinated individuals damn tired giving privileges sake irresponsible unvaccinated individuals.  got Pfizer thing happened gaining ability fight COVID. know people would disagree this. understand downvote . 330 million people HUGE swath land. basically bunch countries within country get many different people get it. challenges US challenges others facing. almost everyone struggling also work healthcare &amp; tested positive vaccination. wasn’t even bad cold. cold. sore throat day, mild cough lasted week, completely lost sense smell. longest lasting symptom far. took 3 weeks come back fully. bizarre. returning like acquiring ability smell different scents one time. One day would watermelon, next day tea, next B.O., next cucumbers. strange.  Clearly people refusing get vaccinated practice social distancing. Don’t insensitive 4. That’s got CVS Security Guard found kicked out. ""could"", think mean will.  true. Breakthrough infections fairly rare, cases outbreaks happen (that's called outbreaks...)

It's like saying people get car accidents, see news 100 car pileup blizzard. Remember 2021 supposed year come nightmare? story heartbreaking. I’m sorry loss. Overseas data reliable better contact tracing. know denominator, also know numerator. Chicago, we've full capacity Cubs White Sox baseball games since June (attended hundreds thousands) well numerous festivals, block parties, outdoor gatherings. Pointing young people blaming cases substantially rise seems pretty unfair, especially since required show proof vaccinations negative test. data suggests Rt delta fully vaccinated population would 1?  thought cause voting right, visiting restaurants / theaters / etc not. news: Water Makes Things Wet Experts warn. Michigan here, too. think delta variant expedite projection? Precisely. WrestleMania even become superspreader event! Cases Florida fell weeks that. - Captain obvious entered chat Nah, won't. People NYC vaccinated likely go full ""THIS LIRBEUL FREEDOM VIOLATION."" They'll annoyed. Unless they're Staten Island. that's different place NYC. wonderful! Thank much taking time offer thoughts this. 

What saying mirrors thoughts. Still, I'm sure last minute decision. kids go school still soft hunker going except literal outdoor excursions medically necessary appointments. agree civic duty sure. personally verified everyone school vaccinated? untrue here?  got vaccinated NYC still work many people, really matter personally affects them.

So lockdowns, masks, social distancing etc personally affect negatively covid hasn't. govt worse covid.

Now things getting worse delta, practically unvaccinated people, resisted vaccine likely known someone ill, hospitalized died virus. personally affected them, affects stats/news Yes! Ontario (Canada) released fantastic, depth report breaks numbers. Ontario 14 million people, Toronto 4th largest city North America. makes great comparison countries. began vaccinations quite late compared USA runs Dec 2020 July 2021. 

They broken numbers see: 1) ""unprotected"" = vaccinated within 0-13 days shot. 2)""Partially Vaccinated"" (14 days 2 weeks 2nd shot) 3) ""Breakout Cases"" 14+ days 2nd shot.

It specific people vaccinations look Appendix A1for hospitalizations, Appendix A2 ICU admissions, Appendix 1c fatalities. appendices include total numbers cases, admissions fatalities. 

The breakout (and partial) cases heavily weighted towards elderly 80+ (appendix 1c) shows 247 fatalities. comparison 2,261 unvaccinated fatalities. 

You find quite interesting look Fatalities among partially vaccinated breakthrough confirmed cases COVID-19 age range: 

Ages 12-49 “BREAKOUT” fatalities = 0 vs unvaccinated = suspect 99% numbers written grab attention vs absolutely accurate. though work actual percentage want. Yeah I'm following proper protocol (quarantine, mask, etc) chance spread thousands people. relaxing guidelines early seems like taking full course antibiotics making problem worst harder deal with. much 50% lives Texas Florida anyone know health ap NYC using gives option showing recent negative covid test entry can't get vaccinated? friends family vaccinated. We're ""out nightmare."" Sure, maybe I'll miss music festival whatever, hang friends family however want. think breakthroughs pretty rare variants vaccines made for. Delta made breakthrough much common. think CDC slow address also people trouble understanding since there’s much vaccine misinformation already. part can't cope authoritarian policies + rule-abiding population = extremely harsh lockdowns unseen anywhere else West consequently lot less deaths global pandemic, resort believing spreading fake bullshit like ""initial reports massive hidden deaths"".

PS: China's per capita death rate COVID-19 anything ordinary compared rest East Asia. Lol first thing came mind. Would mess required. 

On hand tho, space.  Ok, who’s gonna tell need second dose  ""adults"" 18+? Still bad. Covid Delta variant like ""Damn people dumb, let's fun"" Religious exemption allow someone potentially kill others. totally get medical reasons, separation church state means 90 cancer survivor year old risk getting COVID go post office pick flat rate boxes religious nutbag. That’s yoga studio enforcing it. Gets documented attribute account. partner put old plastic sleeve ID badge, type get go conference paper ID tag clip shirt.

We actually used yet (mostly still staying home), guess might using soon.

I think previously places Manhattan ok photo phone. sure boros. I'm sure Staten Island bar restaurant protest days...

As great vaccine roll (I got mine Javits, waited 25 minutes times including 15 minute wait), portable proof vaccination really fubared. Maybe Cuomo bad press today he'll announce major improvement verification system... seeing massive increase symptomatic disease vaccinated individuals. original reply someone saying people never thought around infected individuals vaccinated would lead infection. point months exactly message. I'm sure hermetically sealed house whole pandemic never risked life lives others process, case: good you! Brazil 48% vaccinated least one dose (including truly) nearly 20% fully vaccinated (in São Paulo, largest state, live, \~58% \~23%, respectively) Like kid Stand buried coin jar porch, forgot exactly hole was. difference usa decent vaccine coverage, probably see That's funny considering that's exact reaction people sub see actual data:

164.9 million hospitalizations, 1600 that's less 0.0037% vaccinated folks significant issues. I'm sure everyone downvote go back frightened hypocondriacs course. article says new pass called “Key NYC Pass”. mean heard anything spikes nationwide stadium outings? cases rising across country anymore misinformed? ""Forcing health codes private restaurants gross""

""Forcing private employees wash hands gross""

""Forcing companies pay sewage sanitation gross""

I'm trying jerk, gotten far restaurants bars ROUTINELY proven hot beds disease transmission. business model polluting community, held account. think confused. China’s intention pursue “zero infection” strategy. Since existing vaccines still allow infection, don’t think full vaccination actually benchmark country opened. Also vaccine nearly effective delta variant alpha. I've known many many people vaccinated got ripped town. fully vaccinated still got it. think agree showing ID travel airplane showing papers buy dozen eggs two slightly different thresholds responsibility. Dumb question that’s possibly answered article (paywall): would picture vaccination card phone sufficient? Another entry repeated stupid callousness humanity history. people without empathy charge things worse always happen, mind boggles keep letting happen again... ever escape nightmare, long world population unvaxxed many countries access record number COVID-19 patients hospitals across state dire warnings Florida Hospital Association, Gov. Ron DeSantis dismissed capacity concerns news media “hysteria” insisted “our hospitals open business.”  comments came Tuesday people hospitalized virus Florida rose all-time high 11,515, according data U.S. Department Health Human Services.  shutting down,’' DeSantis said event Miami. “We’re gonna schools open. We’re protecting every Floridian’s job state.”  reporter asked hospitals, said, “I think it’s important point obviously media hysteria, try fear monger, try stuff. they’ll talk hospitalizations, hospitals open business.”  Friday, AdventHealth shifted “code black” canceling non-emergency procedures seeing record 1,600 patients, epidemiologist Vincent Hsu said Central Florida division hasn’t yet reached peak terms patients.  Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa Tallahassee also reporting surge COVID-19 hospitalizations, DeSantis urged local leaders hospital officials more, including president Duval County Medical Society Foundation, called DeSantis issue state emergency.  that, DeSantis focused, done past, pandemic death rate.  think it’s important understand best defenses combination natural immunity that’s built up, seniors-first vaccination efforts,” DeSantis said. “I think that’s steep decline mortality year year. look, end day, would rather 5,000 cases amongst 20-year-olds 500 cases among seniors.”  cases make 90% Miami-Dade’s Jackson UHealth system, DeSantis pointed numbers COVID patients half last summer.  parts Florida, it’s exceeding last summer,” acknowledged.  know media fixates cases, best indicator emergency room visits COVID-like illness,” DeSantis said. “And see go up, know, you’re going see increase prevalence increase hospital admissions. levels goes down, indicators follow that.”  also said Biden administration legal option extending federal eviction moratorium, expired Sunday. DeSantis allowed state eviction moratorium expire earlier.  federal moratorium, said, “was imposed CDC. don’t think authority that. U.S. Supreme Court indicated much.”  Republican governor faced wide criticism handling pandemic.  Saturday, Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber, Democrat, called DeSantis “pied piper” COVID-19 “leading everybody cliff,” interview CNN. though kids rarely die Covid. thinking changed? Yeah think people overestimate many people primary care physicians. people don’t yearly check ups even insurance can’t always afford copay. don’t medical issues probably don’t doctor see regularly that, one thing one ever thinks about- is, admittedly, probably small fraction people- people DPOAs antivax. one resident nursing home unvaccinated, DPOA allow us to. resident already thinks vaccinated. Yeah, need careful people can't get vaccinated.

But testing kids &lt;12. Begone, troll! umbrella keep mostly dry rain jump ocean going effective. letting unvaccinated, infected person personal space long period time chances infected go up. Make proof vaccination status card fits wallet!

NY app verifies proof legit shown instead card. attended Pride Park Grant Park month ago. used 3rd party app called “Clear” submit vaccine card, photo ID, concert ticket one place. anything didn’t pass check, couldn’t get in. expecting something similar Lolla guess not! photo ID different mandating ID shows took new vaccine many previously weary of. said that, I’ve already gotten vaccine, wouldn’t want spread Covid people live with.  news: water wet, 5. places honestly Lol Sorry hear that. Hope gets better! Good Nah. know, billboards Texas blame illegals for....well, everything. think they'll blame illegals pandemic deaths. They'll say money gone help COVID victims going illegals democrats, boom, get re-elected easily. Thank quality post includes info links. CICP often pays $200k. saying that’s small amount forced take vaccine getting injured/death it, larger amount compensate. nerd app media give two shits well society. Good bad, main goal drive headline clicks.

Saying vaccine working exactly best headline saying “99% cases unvaccinated” “25 people fully vaccinated test positive” going bring attention. Good infectious variant leave less room mutation? Thought process: generation fewer inherited parents tree wide instead deep. Delta parent child fewer origins (nodes) vary, therefore genetic consistency.

* R2 - 2, 4, 6, 8, 16
* R4, 4, 16

Same number infections, number infections propagating unique ancestors lower.

I guess could bunk given quantity virus individual knowing uniformly distributed changes person are... I'd think variance would low evolutionary pressure single host likely similar viral population? Nice! Sent first chapter kindle check out. Thanks :) Even vax? 3 weeks-ish (based UK data) wave last least 8-9 weeks. (and that's better vaccinated UK time Delta wave). Florida example already record hospitalizations entire pandemic (daily total). Imagine go 5x? We'll see. Hope right, watching Delta explode restricted heavily vaccinated population shocking last two months.

The UK equivalently vaccinated time onset Delta wave, terms two shots (one shot seems litte Delta). said, vaccinations spread, irregular, elderly less vaccinated USA. think last factor telling. Deaths compared case counts still lower previous waves, ratio much worse US, 80% 65+ fully vaccinated, rather 95%+ uk. Indoor outdoor? two weeks flatten curve! point origin matter much fact event question helped propagate it.

You could catch covid tomorrow could mutate within produce new variant virus reason all, without regard whether go amongst public. hearing cases covid back November 2019 nothing done looked into. That's huge failure every government world. news reporting back imagine Intel leaders had. whole world dropped ball HARD. He's ignoring problem saying exist.
He really made spend week working Covid ward. 

If there's justice guy's next job ""beachcomber"". He's monster. mean, techinally right, deaths effect elgible population much since people turning 12 today tomorrow next day day after. Thank honesty Since person get multiple times, it’s nice delay infections. people able avoid altogether opportunity good masking distancing perhaps luck. everyone opportunity luck, masks reduce spread. Charge interest extra motivation Someone correct wrong, still get sick infect people like unvaccinated even vaccined Delta. vaccine resistant variant likely emerge US.  wonder many smokers completely ignore warnings labels. Vaccination status seem affect chain transmission. certainly reduces severity symptoms. unvaccinated really blame transmission, hospital resource use. think kind opposite. impossible know much exposure anyone virus impossible track. 
You *can* track overall rates infections/hospitalizations/deaths vaccinated unvaccinated people discuss point difference two groups. 
You're saying, ""Sure, what's chance getting sneezed infected person amount times?"" That's... question people asking? put mine passport ppl medical condition cannot get vaccine.

Those people even bigger trouble get actual virus. don’t think need expert warn happening. 74%!! person living Republican state US South, can't comprehend numbers big. Thanks answering. need wish y'all luck big-brain Canada. take care, same. enough population vaccinated make perfect test bed vaccine resistant variant emerge 🎉 can't imagine gatekeep wedding guests want come get shots. Sounds like lot fun.... It’s better collapse hospitals kill men, women,
And children, threaten political ambitions. outbreak gives virus opportunities mutate, which, occurs, exacerbate outbreak part of.

I mean guess could call two separate outbreaks. Yeah, right. Everyone backtracking masking mandates worthless anecdotes. stunning abuse power violation everyone's 4th amendment rights, something easily faked. Surely struck courts. go outside enjoy life. said didn't? Strawman arguments control here.

&amp;#x200B;

It posed little risk me. Yes. agree that. got Delta, would take precautions prevent potentially spreading people might low risk do. Even quarantine, mean everyone else quarantine well. damn near guarantee less 10% attendants followed safety protocols event well event. propagate spread delta variant well likelihood variants vaccine may protect against. 

&amp;#x200B;

There also difference going theme park whatever else acceptable distance crowded people lollapalooza ,screaming, singing yelling. Chances catching spreading delta event like way way likely 99.9% event. fucking shit  assuming republican? not. Donation purchase China, USA COVAX, plus making vaccine within country (CanSinoBio). small amount Sputnik vaccine privately imported well. racist  manager give shit. management likely pressured bring people back office. also don’t track everyone’s movements spyware phone 

  
It's hilarious would believe completely understand. plenty non-work related reasons get vaccine. Anyone holding getting shots keep working home probably wasn’t planning getting timely manner anyways. gonna lie first half.  motivation chip help people make informed decision.

Prior delta, vaccines allowed people relatively safe return normal. 

I &lt; 1 year old unable get vaccinated realistically can't wear mask. protect kid others may need bring send childcare.

My goal commenting remind people invincible vaccine still unknown risk spreading loved ones vaccinated not.  one dividing people contrarian instead taking damn medicine curves deadly virus killing thousands people day. Oh least best wearing mask. NJ usually follows- interesting I’d damn concerned. Twitter thread ran across pediatrician working Houston hospital. “oh kids aren’t susceptible serious disease” crowd: may true OG virus, may true Delta, putting kids hospitals frankly alarming rates, often Covid RSV together. MIS-C often occurs weeks mild Covid case. Kids vulnerable right now.

Addressing comment: well fitted kn95 better masks absolutely benefit wearer even one else masked. Protection cloth masks minimal, surgical masks bit better they’re reasonably snug face.  Yes, middle man put many farmers/ manufacturers business. don’t knock people distributing it, need transported. ne need get rid thing, people chose wrong pretty much feel.

Why people keep repeating demonstrably true? clinical trials vaccines last year protection **symptomatic disease** primary outcome measure. found effective regard. got EUAs. Yes amazingly effective preventing hospitalization death since amazingly effective preventing disease, outcome trial measuring primarily. Covid disease.

Then vaccines started widely used, several studies showed effective preventing asymptomatic infection. everyone based goal herd immunity vaccinated people longer required wear masks. **were** promised immunity infection, least effectiveness so.

This changed delta variant. everyone repeating public health officials statements goal vaccines along prevent hospitalization death. No, wasn't. Stop gaslighting us this. question bridge neccesary, rather stable bridge? Right, I'm saying is, based elderly 96+ vaccination rates, comprised range 90-virtually 100 percent regions age group.

In US, percentage unvaccinated group four times higher, areas, that. would result numbers three four times that, extrapolate population, reach numbers well thousand. Again, would far lower peaks past, many hundreds thousand totally unnecessary, wholly preventable. It’s nearly died COVID. don’t care happens them.

Triggered?  way age like milk?

1. Nothing I've said changed. vaccines work better Delta Beta (B.1.351). B.1.351 spread well, hence almost country predominant variant. Also, real data regarding Lambda. I'm really sure ""gotcha"" trying get here.... Delta changes everything. R-value around 9, versus original UK strains closer 2 3. Chicken Pox level contagious.

Prior Delta, transmission vaccinated extremely low. Delta, viral load vaccinated -vs- non-vaccinated same. 

Delta vaccine booster Pfizer Moderna available later fall (trials ongoing).

&amp;#x200B;

So, yeah. Fuck new variant ass. problem is, vaccinated still suffer it.

If unvaxxed occupy hospital beds, happens vaxxed people need surgery urgent conditions? sincerely, sincerely hope you’re right everyone freaking nothing. 

But even 1000 new infections come festival, that’s what, 15 18 new deaths? current 1.75% mortality rate. acceptable? I’m honestly asking. would ok number dead result festival?

Then trouble reconciling side, “well, fuck don’t want hurt anyone also want live every right too”

But then, preventable loss life….

If total harm avoidance impossible total ignorance risks morally criminal, draw line? Shouldn’t context discussions here? 

Sorry rant. dumping thoughts out.  could lol That’s ridiculous, LiveNation can’t make money vaccine checks, would this? call dept. immunization they'll help fix it. thing happened FL beat one day case number record, large majority unvaccinated. Given careless state been, plenty unvaccinated anti-masker fools go around. Hospitals already overburdened yes possible see things get worse previous hospitalizations FL. think take wrong dangerous misinformation, especially taking Delta variant consideration seems infect vaccinated people nearly rate unvaccinated people.

At point need stressing vaccine mainly protect *yourself* severe illness provides small reduction transmission COVID.

To prevent transmission need stressing masking, distancing ventilation - vaccination.

If get transmission control we're going get Delta variant whether we're vaccinated not. Unvaccinated people burden healthcare systems, vaccinated people develop ""mild"" COVID significant potential loss taste smell long-haul symptoms. Also, unchecked spread virus (in vaccinated unvaccinated) spawn new strains potential deadly, infectious, both. lol...oh buddy, imma stop now. Aren’t saying Delta peak decrease like UK? you’re vaccinated it’s dangerous struck lighting.   live near york rats bedroom whats vaccines believe Desantis's platform slogan **"" MAKE COVID GREAT AGAIN""** ? Yup. could. don’t care love music, went festival. cautious didn’t go. is. sound like Russian troll wanting divide world. too, child 18 vaccinated, business really impact me. However, feels like pretty big gap. get people think go indoors, mean cant even masked?  Maybe. 90 percent say meaningless catch phrases anyway.  Looks like Connecticut became 4th state hit 70% total population 1 dose. Tier 1: People understand things common good, safety others.

Tier 2: Selfish idiots. im bad math calculated? lets say go office everyday (and vaccines arent required masks are). 10% chance happen pretty soon long kills anti vaxxers makes rest scared enough get shot could good thing. Problem is...variants ""Transmission rate unchanged vaccine"" established fact, even seen likely. Stop spreading misinformation. would know kids dieing were. Delta new US UK already data since may. kids fine. Given kids younger 12 going get vaccinated all, think they’re justifiable. 

Mandating masks distancing unvaccinated kids could become problematic later on, though, kids would essentially outcasts school basis parent’s decisions. trouble test use populations. need cite sources tests tested independent confirm robust test result. usually approved disregarded authorities field. trouble is, tests thrown came peer review. Always go source - medical journals - cdc findings. BTW CDC formally admitted PCR tests work changing tests December distinguish covid  Betcha DeSantis got vaccine - ain't dumb! Someone thinks COVID bad advertised nothing we've chance stopping it.

From get belief place achieve Zero COVID lifted restrictions early possible ""saved"" bigger waves would come later, making people wear masks keeping indoor dining shut going prevent anyone getting hit time neighbors. Closing things making people wear masks good tools wave happens, problem proactively, prevent waves. Nothing that.  agree isolation. live alone really took toll can't degree pre-vaccination. 

The thing though vaccinated people spreading too. friend vaccinated got brother also vaccinated. sick 2 weeks still sick. I'm masking indoor spaces outside home. never really resumed socially indoors people since vaccinated corresponded warmer weather. yeah need relax numbers. wait till summer ends come Aww makes totally sense! Thanks breaking me. hate say it....but could lead idiot wipeout. idiots there, without vaccinated, wearing mask definitely see affects covid, sooner later. Let's hope innocent family members friends protected. forget, festival goers many different cities states. warned, alarmed. Protect folks. Books never read $1,000. sure. Back masks mandated Texas, nearly 100% compliance Houston even though enforcement non-existent (governor wrote executive order saying law enforcement cannot enforce mask mandate). without mask mandate, maybe 10-20% masks. 

Most people want make scene stand out. want get groceries get out. one prefers wearing mask, majority people store wearing masks, would comply mandate rather picking fight. 

There may 10% flaunts masklessness statement, that's going minority.A mask mandate drastically increase number mask wearers. let perfect enemy good. Well criteria linked could positive COVID (nucleic acid) test still considered ""suspected"" ""confirmed"" case. 

The criteria say need least two three clinical manifestations, two three require extra tests. third standard symptom like fever. 

Again I'm saying someone tests positive put quarantine, that's another matter. He's likely running President 2024. Rejecting covid restrictions popular segment Republican primary voters. Would care people longer stopped red lights seat belt? protects 100%. Yes, missed stop treating unvaccinated That’s Florida put heavier restrictions place last summer hospitals getting creamed. 400?!? 

400 kids dead alive right now. Only. actually idea Somalia like, feel way Dallas, implore you, please find mental health help need. Cool. Thanks. looking. info place. say KN95 protection others say not. grocery store security guards put charge enforcing mask mandates. things carried police health officials. unreasonable expect security guard properly without increase wage training go along additional responsibility. gamble chunk population never accept vaccines take covid seriously, successfully panders them, he’ll base. Due gerrymandering voting laws, math works potentially let win politically even majority population rejects he’s would never ever vote him.

He can’t win sensible people, cling anti-vax/consider people rest career. (He might also stubborn fragile able ever admit wrong.) Boy thats rough. made right choice sure. Wait! thought saying immigrants. vaccinated too? 

How people claim they're personal responsibility group constantly blame everybody else problems. Ohh lord hate him. lmao people want build strawmen easier engaging reality. precisely. vaccinated people getting sick dying Texas. dead always voted. Ask Pappy O'Daniel. Pillsbury Light-crust Doughboys. See attached link watch ""O Brother Art Thou?"" Charles Durning character based O'Daniel. one singin' &amp; lyin' mofo. I’m worried hospitals getting swamped making hard others get care heart attack issues big surge delta never ended hospitalisations due large numbers ppl vaccinated. quarantine sytem defunct now, made app pretty pointless many people getting pinged Gov dont see dangerous enough warrant many people isolate. Yes schools summer, working home place regulation anymore.

I see point southern US though didnt really think like that, maybe wont go well there? Cook, lake, dupage county also super super high vaccination rates. rate illinois whole misleading southern half state antivax land  like rest life, person responsible safety you. get wrong, managed prevent lot COVID deaths, think hard argue prevented ""all-cause"" suffering, speak. I'd love gritty reboot weekend Bernie's. Like user said, manually checking paper done massive events decades everything QR/RFID/Bluetooth/WiFi thing make quicker. reason that's perfectly possible want believe COVID checks checking former brings money, checking latter makes lose money. Yep, exactly. It’s almost impossible model. Lots people, including vaccinated going get infected. won’t die…. good proportion lingering health effects - that’s something completely skips over. It’s binary. It’s perfect recovery perfect death. 

Delta peak fade away, maybe replaced another variant, hopefully not. 

His idea individuals somehow magically know take safety precautions even would appetite common good (definitely low US) poor Gov Death Sentence appears like nickname. violin playing him.

/s since Reddit.  Yeah. Check other's follow messages delta far infectious.  whole “everybody needs masked now” crowd seems think so. Still better New Coke. right, I'm knowledgeable enough know virologists epidemiologists still call VOC 'strains', fact remains don't. Even muted -- he's still twat. Well vast majority vaccinated so, correct. That's democracy Lollapalooza rejected people without proper documentation see general point, specific scenario Microsoft already internal program set allow people transition full-time remote working, irrespective COVID status. Can’t even trust putting anywhere near beach, look he’s handling red tide year. Except time vaccines, so... No. didn’t personally downvote ya, yeah seems really observation doubt young people give shit Boomer muso thinks do)

I mean, people still like Paul. He’s good guy. Young people don’t view boomer lots downvotes daring suggest Stones better Beatles.

Depends definition better is. I’ll never knock anybody *preferring* one band another, *is* reason vast majority musicians critics consider Beatles “better” terms influence, innovation, musical complexity, etc. totally get preferring Stones’ sound. Amazing still planned. amount denial society apparently limitless.

Screening art-house films person essential activity? That's problem exists though order magnitude difference changes considerably vaccinated. Fauci feelings. say least New York, bother that's part went passports instead. Go subway least 20% passengers masks likely see police officer also wearing mask playing around phones anything. right empose thought onto others? Well… long doses? worries. deleted 'large events' reply idea going :) think Peace Sells better tbh, although Tornado Souls top 3 thrash song version epsilon showing sometime fall? Everyone keep mind schools reopen week…   travelled States last week visit folks. There's mention negative test CDC's website, else located. speaking border agent documentation ready go, asked purpose stay it. Stamped passport sent way.

Everyone line expecting thing, folders negative tests. Border agents give flying fuck.

Like slow moving stampede.  That’s dumb argument. It’s choice. cases hospitalizations happening mostly unvaccinated people. CDC basing recommendations primarily tell Provincetown many reasons stated seems outlier anything. agree caution taken lot people CDC really handled messaging well. case may assume extremely apologetic? Lol bet really care. believe we'll see hospitalization capacity exceed January peaks state-wide. possible we'll see regional peaks exceed January lower vaccination portions state. 

While Delta going burn communities, increasingly small body people without antibodies infect - creates ceiling many hospitalized. even low-vaccination regions, risk vaccinated - reducing risk hospitalization. 

It's still shameful completely preventable. think we'll see worse wave winter; mathematically enough people infect left. Even cases peak higher, shorter duration. means less time ""build up"" long term hospitalizations. Yes dying it, point vaccine. Dispite fearmongering heard zero evidence variant go vaccines used US. Cases dont matter point vaccine keep dying. unvaccinated them. looks like he's trying hold back bodies he's caused pile Florida Well, breakthrough infections never noticed vaccines effective preventing symptoms. actual breakthrough statistics like ""the amount people infection enough symptoms even bothered test forced test got airplane something"". Given effectiveness vaccines, likely higher share breakthroughs go unnoticed vs unvaxxed cases.

Do actually care true amount breakthroughs? sure don't, probably care asymptomatic breakthroughs forced test either. I'm personally convinced care, like all, non-severe case point. r/RaisedByNarcissists welcomes “No shit,” said everyone else. think burden proof man prove commit crime? reading COVIDpositive subreddit sure think so. 

By reading surges happening comparing vaccination rates, really Wouldnt cases rise whether vaxxed unvaxxed since unvaxxed still spread it? would blame unvaxxed? curious mean conservatives unvaccinated overwhelmingly conservatives -  get vaccine live bubble entire life

How asking months (until 12's get vaccinated) mitigation measures like masking ""living entire life bubble""? Vaccines work reason indoor mask mandates reappeared States. 

 Vaccinated people may able spread coronavirus resume wearing masks certain circumstances, nation’s top public health official said Tuesday gloomy acknowledgment mutated delta variant reversed promising trend lines spring.

That's - they're asking lock downs, people areas wear mask little longer rising case numbers. equating ""living *entire* life bubble"". make sense. 2-3 years still vaccinated?  You’re right track edit “[do anything all] sub unhappy.” around 60-70% Delta? 

[""With BNT162b2 vaccine, effectiveness two doses 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 95.3) among persons alpha variant 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 90.1) among delta still honestly great. 95, difference two (to me) virtually indistinguishable. 

Agree rest, unless brand new different mega virus emerges sort precautionary measures similar level last year entirely unwarranted. Well… looks somewhat like plan think whatever want want get bottom what's going on. tackle vaccine hesitancy among black Americans? laid out, distribution issue. Downvotes brought people denial long pandemic last.  No. make claim infectious prove it. made claim. cop arrests need provide evidence DA needs prove committed crime America innocent proven guilty... infavor guilty proven innocent.  Screw IMO. people actively selfishly affecting rest us need taught hard lesson. Science doesn’t care believe, virus. family members frontlines shit deal insane. majority people gladly taken it. numbers good be, vaccinated population definitely majority. OMG Lindsey Graham literally said “mild symptoms” glad vaccinated “without vaccination certain would feel well now.”

Please read him. Good job Lori Lightfoot !!!! Gotta get money suppose.. Hospitals packed now, train stations everything insane doesn’t? covered all? Absolutely not. hill people chose to, quite literally cases, die shit right thank you. can’t see happening California state level right Gavin Newsom’s recall situation, he’s unlikely anything rock boat politically. sucks I’m favor vaccine mandates, point it’s going local businesses local government make kinds calls. anyone actually think breakthrough cases cause? Isreal would disagree.  UK never surge delta overwhelming hospitals like South. southern US world epicenter. It’s easy come back level infection COVID animal reservoirs. Hard imagine ever going away. However, much easier imagine everyone vaccine matter little. 


I know mean. Nephews school parents praising fact reason switched schools didn’t require kids wear masks. Good job making child’s education political spreadnecks. Contagious-wise yes, certainly deadlier variant based statistics. Ah, realize that. probably right. I'd imagine schools start parents gotta find babysitters take work outbreaks happened, they're still unvaccinated maybe it'll pick more. going happen. guessing. positive. already happened states schools started in. realize held Euro match 60,000 attendees June F1 event? restrictions nightclubs open. think. Sweating, coughing, sneezing throwing around people willing swap body fluids. Even covid people getting massively sick events. Even prepared person covid still got sick. gonna death toll massive proportions. way around think states vaccinated going worse wave.

Here SW Missouri Delta never quits understand event allowed take place first place? Quit fearmongering, there’s need sensationalism. Maybe medical workers stop wearing masks. That’s true. “Freedom Day?” everything completely wide open, concern? I’m sure must be. I’m GA it’s hot it’s surprising see kids running around masks parents around enforcing it. It’s really necessary outside guess kids accustomed Yall going pretend rolling loud happen lmao words capture moment emotion perfectly. well written. agree there's thing called oath ethics. Going path would set horrible precedent medical ethics dont think that's something us want

""No treatment dont fit xyz requirement"" horribly slippery slope even fathom aren't. type conspiracy theory easily debunked take bit time read up.  father still scared get vaccine, says sort “horse medicine” that’s good now. really wish would get vaxxed it’s difficult talk him. happen mention spread reduced compared someone without vaccine? Wow.  people coming ""99% hospitalizations unvaccinated"" statistic current went back far, hope hits home. 

Vaccines WORK even Delta, regardless mild breakthrough cases. Perspective important. India indeed problem. Especially due population density, fact there's vaccine hesitancy problem too. top off, lineup year isn’t exactly going attract best brightest. course I’m vaccinated. I’m stupid. think point people aren’t vaccinated, get Covid it’s damn problem. Mine. 

It’s annoying wearing mask. like seeing people’s faces. It’s harms me. it’s fun. wouldn’t feel like vacation mask whole time. already mask 8 hours day office, even though I’ve vaccinated months. last thing want mask more. wrong. Well government would simply add EUA: 

“Anyone fully vaccinated 6+ months ago receive booster choose.” 

We wouldn’t problem people chasing illicit boosters. I’m glad see people starting get vaccine again, still dowsed going waste. 

Other countries already starting, shouldn’t lag behind. I'm saying vaccination passports impossible enforce without breaking changing human rights laws.

I'm also however changing breaking human rights laws totalarian beliefs.

The government authoritarian power people able change serious laws place protect people without democracy. There's good reason human rights laws multiple good reasons changed circumstances.

The good news vanishingly unlikely. vaccine binds specific protein. theoretically possible, sure, virus basically another virus point.

Unvaccinated people going die, damn fault. wife vaccinated, 10 month old daughter obviously not… naturally causes lot stress anxiety us. 

If I’m reading summary correctly, you’re saying data shows wife could potentially pass breakthrough case. would interesting see breakthrough cases compare non-vaccinated cases terms timing exposure. data incubation period breakthrough cases? incubation period whole relates delta?

I saw comment say couple days short fully vaccinated. really point, things considered, really much threat someone else who's vaccinated.

However, bigger picture need take action mitigate large numbers deaths pandemic caused. Ordering takeout sitting outdoor setup small sacrifice small number people caught may technicality like girlfriend compared overall number lives likely saved policy.

Also, outdoor setups places *a lot* nicer eating inside, hope retained pandemic. Many streets either closed off, parking removed really adds experience. Bump another 2-3 half population still fully vaccinated course countries like Brazil President still insists ""the flu."" providing actual research instead opinion piece race-baiting columnist?

The vaccines available nationwide. someone chooses get it, accept consequences choice. Yes no, lot dumb idiots think wave ""recent"" elections, happened 2 months ago, others blame kids went back class short month ago, though extremely limited, others traditional restaurants/bars/clubs enforcing restrictions.

So, lot different speculations definitely based scientific research. say 'more'. I'm fan later stuff (pretty much 1980s onwards) vastly prefer '60s &amp; '70s Stones anything Beatles ever did.

Quite fascinating dichotomy lot likes arguably personal attack 'fellow kids' dig (which really observation doubt young people give shit Boomer muso thinks do), lots downvotes daring suggest Stones better Beatles. think time start requiring Proof Vaccination coming another state. I'd love give similar ""F U"" refuse get vaccine. individuals putting *can't* get vaccine medical reasons far greater risk. need everything possible reach vaccine refusers ensure reach herd immunity sake vulnerable kids vicinity. Vaccine mandates legal, due process. People also leave jobs like rules job. plenty things job like. comply find new job.

There vaccines side effects present \~8 weeks vaccination. We're year usage. side effects known. contrast, viruses side effects present years decades later. terrified. I’m terrified point im basically speechless. going go real fast vaccines arrive.

I sure that. certainly hope right, time tell. Yeah, don’t know doesn’t make feel least bit relieved. Actually think Brazil gets enough supply they'll Gucci- nearly 50% population least one dose today.

Their president idiot vaccine hesitancy high understand. They've excellent vaccination past- like, exceeding high income countries uptake distribution.

Course foibles cholera that's complicated. Bolsonaro squarely blame problems right now. Huge overlap people blasting attendees people saying ""omg even covid would nightmare people enjoy that?"" And… one cares Overly contrarian?? talking about? show study Lambda immune escape Beta? Idk deal is. Hey bud, checking see authoritarian police state treating ya!!! Assuming safety data 3rd shot, let people get it.  initial reports massive hidden deaths wuhan ever disproven?

They're impossible disprove. always gonna long one. Head back pharmacy got vaccinated. records issue new card. administered state, reach state's health department, separate hotline covid vaccinations, they'll able answer question.  Scroll Vaccine Hotline. You’re right, must remember everything wrong than. remember highlight vaccines highly efficacious preventing symptomatic disease. wasn’t decrease hospitalization severe symptoms result this?

But I’m sure I’m wrong say vaccines never promised fully make one immune virus. means even vaccinated individuals possibly carry virus, thus spreading it. difference Delta much contagious, therefore even vaccinated individuals carry higher viral loads before.

However, despite case, vaccinated individuals still safe Delta. Recent data proven that, given majority hospitalizations unvaccinated individuals . point is, willingly deny protection, live choice made. Case counts high, large majority people vaccinated, wouldn’t worrying deaths hospitalization. Check r/COVID19positive question answered.  I'm expert, I'm certain will. Tell three-year old nephew liver transplant. Covid stay. Vaccinations readily available. going learn live it. family gathered tightly sealed room sing happy birthday. evening, could outside...I leave room go hunger down. 

I imagine full time workers health dealing this. I'm part time horrendous.

People care. I'm losing it. Still would rather mess long term effects. Even don’t die still impact. I’m also saying make rules children. I’m going careful.  Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection produces B-cell responses continue evolve least one year. time, memory B cells express increasingly broad potent antibodies resistant mutations found variants concern1. result, vaccination coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) convalescent individuals currently available mRNA vaccines produces high levels plasma neutralizing activity variants tested1, 2.

I'm curious works. Without anything immune system fight, triggers evolution immune system combat yet-discovered-strains? think lot people would say “god plan” vote Republican best interests Exactly, saying ""be fine"" really bit rose colored glasses statement. Kids resilient virus, means immune. also far insulated last School year, upcoming one. far read percentage deaths hospitalizations pediatric cases stayed even Delta, number total pediatric cases gone up, meaning cumulative number children hospitalized likely increase.

Don’t care anymore, want take risk unvaccinated that’s them, vote   really missing point article. antibodies, antibodies infection different less consistent vaccines. Getting vaccinated infection still recommended CDC generates highest levels immunity terms antibodies.

You talk doctor it, real doctor real medical degree, chiropractor natural healing doctor.

Antibody levels spike infection generally lower vaccination. 

Antibodies N, M, E proteins generated vaccination (Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J), made response infection. three antibody types non-neutralizing (they protect directly, i.e. neutralizing antibodies stop viral particles able enter cells), may provide additional immunity.

There guy months ago posting daily thread, wish saved could find you. basically said parents got Covid mom got vaccinated afterwards, dad didn't. got get antibody tests, test ""protected"" 4u/ml. dad 16u/ml, mom 2,400u/ml, possible? okay? different numbers?"" honor system approach masking spring/summer worst idea year. went phish show 10k ppl last Friday masks.

Ok buddy. evidence suggest delta variant behind surge Brazil? They’ve reported 140 cases (although obviously severe estimation). year half talking decades. Stop hyperbole. continue implement half assed measures (we never actual lockdown), longer take. Germany elections coming month, decisions made direction don’t care. Even causes small increase cases since vaccinated literally matter shame all! wife breast fed months receiving vaccine (April - June) 100% formula. Thank share! Uber literally giving free rides get vaccines even talking about. Given prevelance Delta Isreal seems pretty likely data based that.

Regardless part equation likely we're seeing studies show vaccinated individuals experience breakthrough infection clearing virus much quicker unvaccinated individuals. quicker clearance virus would pretty notable impact ability infect individuals vs unvaccinated individuals regardless variant involved. (which would impossible). 

It impossible, check tickets, would take bit longer, perfectly possible check tests vaccination cards. Sweet convenient person knows *multiple* people breakthrough infections caused severe problems. Sure Jan.

AGHHH Yes did. know lot bikers fully believe 26 people total got spread people attendees. thing Eiffel Tower + feel like things could easily faked Yeah I'm trying understand motivation here. think boils really caring people (masked ""it's choice""). 

I get inconvenience wearing mask part. person already wearing mask work 8hrs day. forgo Vegas trip indoor mask mandate, ""it takes fun away"" trip.

I guess loops back caring. bottomline person. right thing especially gyms. can't imagine dangerous people huffing puffing 2ft away sweating. Well air tanker cdl drivers get paid well usually. could will, fucks want keep opening everything. agree you. don’t think long report vaccinated folks getting Covid way 1% time. getting severely ill hospitalized, testing positive. 1% statistic seem match seeing real life. vaccinated really still much risk, overall, compared unvaccinated. Yes, breakthroughs seems occurring more, large vaccines still much job keeping cases fairly mild. no, vaccines absolute. absolute still need everyone take ever get this. cares baby do? wife vaccinated pregnant?

I'm similar position nervous 4 month old catching Covid, despite wife vaccinated vaccinated pregnant. Good paying jobs get work. /s Sadly think got horse medicine doctor, he’s also hearing family cousin vaccine weird bug bite like marks legs. I’m sure he’s willing take seriously all. Also directly words said “Lindsey Graham vaccinated still got COVID”  sure mean. saying unvaccinated group allowed eat? CDC Politicians would gladly lock country completely again. populace would never let them.

We one blame ourselves. Everyone wants blame someone else, me. you. everyone knows someone vaxxed yet guilt tripped getting it.

Just like world's problems, must accept individual responsibility. ""What could personally done different make outcome better?' Thank you! Came back days ago Vegas. masked indoors entire time I’m fully vaccinated. I’m work suddenly feeling sore throat. wear mask whole shift try get tested afterwards, hoping it’s cold knows🙃  Delta breaking more, vaccines still much work. need stop large gatherings like Delta through, however, becoming obvious groups like Delta spread among vaccinated people. Breakthrough cases always going happen, nothing hundred percent, hundreds millions doses, always going seem like lot cases. Delta making worse. media needs stop making story, increasing vaccine hesitancy resistance. breakthroughs, delta, it, primarily caused vaccine hesitancy getting shots. FDA needs approve damn thing already stop excuse make mandates legally stable. ""I know media fixates cases,...""

Whatever. reading lot Great! tell family fun filled trip Kazakhstan off? believe sub everyone knows someone vaccinated tested positive. Human beings pretty terrible judges risk, general.

I mean, look flood zones U.S., example. probably right..... Look case chart   ""surge"" 6 months long  /r/woosh NYC new app stores picture vaccine card. Works anyone.

Australia also started using Google Pay Apple Pay today, let's hope US joins in.   everyone contagious proof? Yet, IDEA caught it. think both. funny me, I'm middle set, Fred Durst actually asked crowd many vaccinated, big cheers.

He's pro-vax, yet people assume fronts Limp Bizkit, he's automatically idiot.  experience past weekend, no. 

Everyone unmasked drinking/chatting like times. understand that, people vaccinated know.

It worked many viruses maybe work again, know deal foil hatters. Well 0.5% total US population died.

It's big ass number, math wise barely moves needle. Abbott already basically made illegal Texas. never happen here. experts article disagree. people would get vaccinated FDA would approve fucking thing already. know that’s got it? Honestly? hit gas station hand? grocery store after? Realistically idea whether caught festival not. yeah mean live exist. coronavirus isnt going away. so, right now, vaccinated person, another tiny variable complicated equation chances you’ll die “before time”

Furthering anti-vax narrative vaccines work there's breakthrough cases. always going cases, there's due delta. vaccines still work, still keep infections large mild. issue huge, close gatherings delta swirling. issue still need people getting vaccinated.

So please, stop reporting breakthrough cases go back reporting IS, large, much pandemic unvaccinated breakthrough cases result, story. people really dumb staggering really. That's great hear, sure implies. vaccine easy demographic groups get, multiple demographic groups lagging behind, one demographic group primarily getting criticism vaccinated? Lol sub still scared go outside? Oh, membah.. hope right. sounds like way Staples did.  th

Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions.

Here’s excerpt many, many reports fever injection site reactions (to expected), also, shall say, head-scratching reports. woman reported large bald spot top head following vaccination. Someone simply wrote in, “Nosebleed.” saw report “anal leakage.” one person complained suddenly becoming impotent. Meanwhile, end spectrum, funniest report saw stated, “My penis swelled ten times size.”

You literally make submit anything VAERS. Link  privilege…

Back April staying til midnight mashing f5 CVS website. Got first appointment popped up. Didn’t care vaccine signed for. drive 30 min get it. 

You really lazy. That’s true least completely accurate. breakthrough infection yes transmit well unvaccinated currently breakthrough infections rare. 

Yes much much safer vaccinated main concern spread unvaccinated. media relying shock value eyeballs. realize average American educated 15 year olds. it’s like engage people intellectually here, don’t even try, would never work. fat, stupid superiority complex. lol expect? Sounds like covid-related stroke, maybe? fuck home. End story.

I'll take chances. Masks never enforced, would gone long way keeping things right now.

What happended wad completely predictable Technically contraindicated unless reaction particular vaccine components past. anaphylactic reaction Pfizer, can’t get second, I’m glad got first. 

Also family history Guillian-Barre even history contraindication. monitoring closely husband child. zero problems either dose Pfizer. 

FWIW, I’m eyeing Novavax potentially since can’t another mRNA dose gets EUA approval. I’m woman 50 genetic clotting disorders parents j&amp;j good option me. It'll work supporters morons. Meningitis vaccine called today's politics, assure people would trying cheat it. photo card, sides vertical collage, phone. also made simple Apple Wallet pass QR code. Scanning code leads copy card uploaded personal website. pass vax info CDC logos, looks somewhat legit.

There’s websites create pass seem sketchy upload personal data. might notice 100,000 people try one weird trick. Bump everyone N95 masks safety glasses slow spread, super important!

Ha ha ha, kidding, science boring- go party!/s see making point all.

New York spike 3/24. anomaly data used NYT. anomaly clearly indicated explained NYT March 24, 2021: multiday disruption reporting data, New York City health department reported several days’ worth data, leading spike reported cases deaths New York March 22, 2021: number cases deaths reported state artificially low New York City report new data. city health department said reason ongoing issues receiving processing data New York March 21, 2021: number cases deaths reported state artificially low New York City report new data. city also announced counts recent week artificially low. Exposure = time * distance. 

You far likely get sitting next someone hour passing someone hallway. Hopefully way verify accept documentation countries/states course there's nuance everything. Overwhelmingly though, shown CDC article parent, AA community least willing get vaxxed regardless accessibility. Way less Hispanic community par whites. huge problem. Electorial college =/= people. Trump got fired urban Americans landslide. number really matter, density proximity matters. That's makes particularly scary want get vaccinated generally lives near one another. dunno, 50 million doses 50 million days seems kinda slow  Also, add beyond stupid blame people. People act individual desires.

You want blame someone, blame politicians approved permits this, blame politicians refused enact policies allowing us eliminate covid, blame politicians made 2020 never fucking end.

There countries planet covid literally problem. Why? politicians actually fucking try. Unlike here, blame kids kids expecting kids stop kids. choose people represent us supposed adults room. I'm pre sure states /are/ getting over-run. Mostly un-vaccinated ones ""I got Big Florida"" Yea can't get it. FDA approves it. anyone found way chew food without getting stains mask? elementary kids 0% vaccinated. That's I'm predicting massive spread elementary schools.

I see FDA's logic requiring data approving vaccine kids. average, kids fine even get sick. disagree decision delay trials, ensures many kids get virus, may spread families communities. Yeah, feels like ""omg look beaches!"" posts last year. Yes, going use Quebec. Makes harder fake, scan scanner, making easy scanning tickets. could also scan email phone.

Can help find masks right $$$  don’t think keep long (if even end implementing it). sure prefer vaccination mask requirements places it’s lot effective doesn’t punish us part keep antivax safe. People state / country show vaccination cards upload app prior trip. People without smart phones also cary vaccine card (although that’s small portion NYC won’t even affect restaurants). Restaurants won’t “get tired” “fade away” unless profiting, it’s business won’t close “tired” still making money. comes whether think people stop frequenting indoors dining (I certainly won’t).  Latest data says 99.99% vaccinated people don’t get infected enough spread. However we’re large country lot people aren’t getting vaccinated 0.01% still represents threat.

The data change look virus mutates.

To scientist accept current accurate data. situation changes opinions.

The vaccines still vital. virus mutates enough we’ll need boosters. several months get DeSantis John Travolta ""where everyone?"" meme. CDC messaging atrociously bad throughout pandemic. embarrassing failure them. probably means, ""We still hospital capacity continue live like there's problem all. get sick die, tough luck"" 

Governor state. joke. probably trust guy walmart cashier, is, running state. Jackass **Florida man entered chat.* Illinois Lollapalooza week: “Hold beer!” CDC gave us way verify vaccinations. options everyone wears mask one wears mask. choice seems obvious healthcare workers getting fucked over. expected, lots cases there. People happen happen hospitalized. wish companies allowed require vaccination proof country. Nah. They're ""I got COVID I'm fine ^(my great aunt uncle died going die soon anyway) "" huff puff climb 3 steps porch. + pre-pandemic behavior sufficient stop growing slope cases

True. Many people returned normal like COVID gone. never stopped wearing mask, unvaccinated higher-risk 3-year-old home, pandemic household. Delta, I'm wearing N95. I’ve scanned mine sized keep wallet original one laminated home Yes, emailed bf basically told next contract choosing contractors vaccinated FIRST. spread covid minutes exposed it. takes takes infect, incubate create enough virus body spreadable. There's reason 72 hours magic number, cuz long takes start shutting virus infected Unvaccinated also geographically distributed evenly, areas low vaccination rates essentially petri dishes. even vaccinated people get transmit Covid. delta variant especially scary. immunocompromised warned get Covid, could die. decided life worth risk. someone position 15years excellent employee fired spot don’t want get vaccinated yet? matter vaccinated - Delta still infects vaccinated people. Every vaccinated person gets infected causes chances create completely vaccine-resistant strain. coming scientists. know, 'trust science?'

My attitude perfectly healthy. know why? still caught yet plan keep way. Stay fuck home. End story. Poggers we've seen time time again, trying question verify anything often turns fist fight. thousands attendance, likely quickly turns riot. US government media marketed vaccine like scam caller marketing 'tech support'. First, fear, get vaccine probably die, insulting, idiot take vaccine, threats, take vaccine might able make purchases engage public activities, coercion, take vaccine may lose livelihood.

While happening, doctors scientists misgivings regarding policies regarding COVID-19 effects vaccines immediately ruthlessly drummed mainstream, time people power fear questions something hide. Also, policy keeps changing again. First masks, masks all, two masks, one mask, mask vaccinated, probably mask even vaccinated.

That's really brief summary, minds lot people like ""Red Flag, Red Flag, Red Flag, Red Flag, Red Flag, Red Flag, RED FLAG"" create trust people, media, government.

So even vaccines miracle supposed be, even general masks work well COVID-19, media government done absolute best destroy goodwill large portion American people. NPIs schools, kids unvaccinated, places agree justified. would go health insurance hook plan says.

If lack health insurance, guess hospital dont pay declare bankruptcy number deaths us enough huge tragedy enough much effect population statistics. reference, we've lost 0.19% US population far.

USDA also helped rule chances cross-reactivity testing subset samples using second type antibody test even specific SARS-CoV-2. second test’s results mirrored earlier findings, suggesting tests truly picking SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, USDA told National Geographic statement.

In terms coronavirus origin tracing, great information US intelligence community. SARS-CoV-2 infect deer early pandemic? fully vaccinated coworker came nasty breakthrough infection spending week partially vaccinated relative. relative verge going hospital. coworker basically bad flu symptoms began two days ago. joke even among vaccinated.

Many people know think 70% kids vaccinated use reason think zero regulations good idea kids go back school weeks. Yep time move Crowded concert could cause cascade Covid cases? pass opportunity?  Yeah agree that. Virginia probably best data right track cases vaccine status, hospitalizations, yeah breakthrough cases still pretty rare. Since mid June, 97% Covid cases state unvaccinated, says lot looking since January. number held true last weeks well even Delta variant spreading. usually get clusters

Dumbasses travel herds. work bar. I’m pretty familiar that.

General understanding world works always never generally used. Plus excessive press efficacy ranges enough people understand impervious. US hoarded vaccines supplies months admonished. People died that.

But US vastly outdonating every nation isn’t close. *The reaction introduction drivers licenses, Anonymous. Circa 1903. New York City, New York.* people vaccinated not. PPE protects unvaccinated high risk pretty much 100 percent used correctly. Let wear want protect instead making everyone miserable. personally worried that.

That’s dress uniquely and/or distinguishing tattoos markings music festivals. everyone’s safety.

“Yeah I’m pretty sure got 300lb dude wearing red Speedo tribal body paint”  like idea, doubt execution.

God world economies saved, spread word completely get two years vacations would want go concert.....I went Mexico March ball. fully vaccinated loving life. Thing is, still masked whenever possible Delta variant major issue then. said, necessarily think deadlier point......I think early tell. But, highly contagious heard. way expert pretend be. happy able go three day concert (esp Fla none less!) one party got sick. That's wonderful! Personally would hate catch it, symptoms, pass infant grandchildren mother eligible due transplant issues. business requires proof vaccine, likely comfortable patronizing business, all.

I find pretty good though appears reputable source. constitutional right provides conducting business? government restrict business dealings whole slew reasons. Public safety sure one them. disagree that, principle. allowed to. fact getting downvoted terrifying.  read somewhere yesterday given Delta's large R0, vaccination would need 85% herd immunity. doubt ever get 70% shots.

And even worse variant emerges comes here, really throw wrench everything. cant buy panic right now. hospitals full unvaxxed. vaxxed. Ce la vie That's right. vaccinated population also representative actual population, geared towards risk.

If 55% double vaccination split evenly throughout population, number unvaccinated deaths would therefore much higher. Chicago it’s suburbs different rest state. accurate comparison. percentage people always going commit fraud, reason policies. 

Getting vaccine free easy, could go today get legit vax card nearly anywhere USA cost wait. get decent fake vax card probably cost little bit money effort, effort getting actual shot. remember years ago video bunch people climbing fence, too. happens every year.

What terrible statement. worked PF college. confirm would really concerned bothering people this. people would become irate even asking put jacket away stop dropping stuff loud lol really balance. think outdoor events go on. think people cautious exposure mixing especially vulnerable unvaccinated folks. 


I feel better cases graph stops exponential. There's enough data right know making things worse.  good news delta variant news/propaganda, gaining % points quickly vaccinated stats. price pay little stress controversy... think bad thing. could save lives. alternative go back capacity restrictions put business. Vaccine mandates highly vaxxed place like NYC won’t dent business.

It interesting see unvaxxed parts country since spent last six months turning weapons arsenal covid still there. Strictly masked? sure? Hard enforce masking 20k people kid room another kid since Feb 2020.

Your kid serious issues life keep way.

Kids barelly affected covid, affected social withdrawal. Right, 19% 125,000 24,000 long Covid cases. raw number breakthroughs almost certainly higher. total number breakthrough cases likely higher 125,683, since nine states, including Pennsylvania Missouri, provide information, 11, like Covid hotspot Florida, provide death hospitalization totals. mean empirically?  NPR great interview one CDC's doctors yesterday, put new delta numbers context. 

They pointed hundreds cases popped East Coast festivals vaccinated people, 4 ended hospital, none life threatening positions.

They also noted covid get vaccinated akin colds, rather organ threatening. also noted locations (nose mouth) spread, net effects are, again, akin colds.

They also noted three hundred cases 25K gathering, (in words) drop bucket. 

I think serious fear mongering going post-vaccination world trying suggest still position pre-vaccine.  There's also evidence third shot Pfizer provide additional protection top first two, that's person replying referring to. Lmao remember US cases single digits stores shutting decontaminate covid SUSPECTED person shopped there? like sorry people gotta die. That’s fucked DPOA would unvaccinated let adult get vaccinated. Especially someone high risk category. kids 7 5. want vaccinated bad almost want lie pretend 12 get shot. still get covid infect others vaccinated. Even you’re pretty safe severe illness, you’re risk permanently damaging olfactory system absolutely sucks. lose smell forever, others seem recover suddenly develop parosmia terrible, smells turn rancid/burnt/acrid months/years.

/r/parosmia what’s issue then? people campus vaccinated (immunocompromised learning remotely), odds severe illness minuscule vaxxed populations. Doesn’t matter get COVID, we’re vaxxed anyways. 

If lie vaccine card, you’ll probably get really sick. Sucks you, it’s university problem. We're already people attitude whole time 
thinking masks optional, thinking social distancing optional, help us trace contacts? ""Nah nat me!"" Vaccinated people still getting sick. People compromised immune systems first die ignorance. 


This whole situation would funny I'd absolutely remorse know people directly effect selfish individualism. strange thing is, one thing right promote say vaccines get us it. even one first people get vaccine. crazy constituents listen him?

I mean get wrong. screwed LOT things, wish followers would listen one thing got right. no, reason ONE THING agreed on, still failed.

I mean followed idiotic advise many things, good thing ONE thing don't. baffling. Netherlands checking in. Netherlands prematurely opened infection rate sky rocketed. reinstating restrictions infection rate went again. 

I Debbie Downer careful. Hopefully infection rate skyrocket Scotland. might want talk someone going appointment. think they're going recommend getting vaccine sick - even soon sick. one point, recommendation 90 days covid infection. yeah...except that's happening. People need vaccinated though knows next variant look like hope vaccine manufacturers governments tooling deliver ongoing boosters tackle new variants, world coming time soon. also need improve vaccine manufacturing delivery capacity around world rolled quickly. much world still waiting vaccines, meantime virus adapting existing ones. yet? Imagine would numbers vaccines date would expect see clusters coming KC Royals, TB Rays, Marlins games

We talking contact tracing countrywide, NYC. pointed Florida Missouri. Florida, quick google search, says contract tracing weak point working. I'm going say - bang job following up. Governor DeSantis also speaks it.

Missouri hard find articles on. say - information could find quick min Stop nonsense. Hardly anyone India vaccinated. many exceptions rule, like violence, taxes, Obama Care, medical conditions, behavior ruled personal choice. point, United States, otherwise healthy adult excuse act towards self preservation. choice. virus exists. Weighing options still making choices. store says wear mask shop someplace else. job says get vaccinated go find different job. airline says must mask fly. 

The Army saying, ""No excuses."" Thank you. needed stated. pandemic still large pandemic unvaccinated. could Spreadnecks refuse get vaccine wear simple mask. Since I'm fully vaccinated, covid dangerous common cold flu, mask distance see need distance anymore covid. Anyone sort significant risk covid opportunity get vaccinated months, anyone immunocompromised still risk covid similar higher risk number existing viruses there. Getting vaccine simple, forging card ongoing risk. people cheating trying make statement. never knew anyone tried cheat meningitis vaccine college. yes, 2.

Lol, courts, primarily driven conservative judges ruled two decades fourth amendment 2,977 people killed 9/11. conservatives expect reverse course disease killed 607,000 people? real exposure outdoor events would bathrooms, super-spreader events incidental since right place right time. nightclub bar much dangerous place large event.

I’m saying it’s bad decision, I’m saying told people 2018 you’d required show vaccination card order dine restaurant go gym 2021 people would call crazy, short time later it’s considered normal. crazy think much changed little time.

Got appointment tomorrow. side effects? last guy pulling shit *before* pandemic… understand point new app Excelsior Pass already works everywhere already implemented. cover anything done covered Excelsior Pass?

One thing know cant get state Excelsior Pass got vaccinated outside NYC, wondered targeted tourists way get ""Key NYC Pass"" even got vaccine elsewhere. makes sense since immunocompromised one vulnerable population. Barrier? Hmm..so blocked people getting vaccinations... criminal?  I'll consider it, though I'm trying spend less time twitter haha! Yes he's sick stupid individual, apart him, still par lot nations vaccination wise.. plus mandates lockdowns still enforced states municipalities. society say. vaccine available don’t take get banned places. Excluding people like immunocompromised. us vaccinated taken precautions sick accommodating unvaccinated way.  seriously want someone put numbers perspective.

 reference - Ontario, COVID hospitalizations peaked around 2k, ICU's slightly 1k. nearly paralyzed healthcare system due shortage ICU beds. Florida, right 11k hospitalizations (?), 2.4k people ICU (?).

 looks different Ontario's hospitalizations ICU ratio, means Florida ICU beds spare Ontario. may mean something completely different due different definitions.

 someone double check source data used, standard definitions? dude remember people literally arms idea they'd hunker month two?

Pepperidge Farms remembers. know douchebag race. 85% UK lives area smaller state Louisiana. would expect effects delta variant play lot slower US peak, think cases decline fast UK. don’t think states death numbers bad peak. Using cases disingenuous vaccines essentially broken link catching COVID death. may 50 percent 70 percent adults vaccinated. Wow really? could thought That's also tragic ashamed happened well. something happened past mean ok perpetuate. 

Growing society way improve. God, too. keep vaccine card convinced would pull polio. I’d assume R0 doesn’t take account who’s vaccinated who’s not, correct? that’s case, 10-12 R0 half population vaccinated pretty scary stat. Yeah , teacher 1/1000 chance kill like school. vaccine teacher I'd go Pfizer there's shorter waiting time shots, get full effects quicker. I've also heard Moderna slightly worse side effects. far anecdotal evidence goes, got Moderna bad, pretty sore arm times touch fatigue body aches second dose. got Pfizer barely sore arm. 

That said, Moderna ends choice area, bother holding Pfizer, Moderna still great worth getting. one guilty anything though. still understand premise question valid here. bullshit, posted Facebook removed saying spam. 

All crap allow take New England Journal Medicine. 

This they're complicit misinformation. think talking virologists, epidemiologists. Virologists apparently even convinced delta spreads faster classic strange. Remember worried catching cooties?

Also, deer produce new mutation (or detected).
Among 5 tigers Bronx zoo infected, 3 produced mutation.

Maybe animals mutations like passage 2 serial passage experiments. hope get see genome sequence wild deer, soon. Yes. many people reddit choosing focus vaccinated people masking enough instead people refusing vaccine. insane.

We anything vaccinated people doing. unvaccinated. Period. imagine half fools twitter couple weeks ago praising mask mandates avoiding large gatherings. indefinitely. time afraid living small chance dying vaccinated. exercise poor judgement...  original coronavirus strain R0 around 2.5. rough estimate herd immunity (1 - 1/R0), gives 60% 100%effective vaccine. Alpha variant R0 40% higher, around 3.5, herd immunity around 70%. Delta monster R0 likely greater 6, possibly 8. implies herd immunity level close 90%, we're taking lower end range. pissed long took get son test. hassle 3 days symptoms didnt want let in, yet Staples adamant wouldnt let without it. didnt even ask.  sorry. infuriating end many people put position choosing food/housing actual personal health safety. messed none way.

That's even better comparison.  forced get vaccine parents :D Chances infection way you’re vaxxed. people vaxxed, there’d less spread less cases. Pretty simple. unvaxxed would rather “own” Biden protect families, I’m sure shit gonna go way protect case count anymore.

Depends mean settle permanently. hospitals overwhelmed point? Unlikely. deaths reach Jan 2020 levels? Almost certainly not. cases rise point? Yes. world vaccinated transmissible variants pop up. case waves continue get shorter less deadly. wall coverage!

Just make sure walls 6 feet apart, duh. 1,800 kids died H1N1 2009. Stopping society 400 nobody gave shit 09 ridiculous.

It's apparent organizers give flying fuck, they're make sure event happens make bank. means pretend like *really* care actually preparing, they'll act like care, legal worries gone inevitability happens event actually happens.  Seems fine make lot assumptions HR department MUST operate.

Federal law says employers must make reasonable accommodations employee’s religious beliefs, long accommodation impose undue hardship employer. don’t think many employers, particularly healthcare providers, would find much stretch employees vaccinated virus causing raging pandemic undue hardship them.

Again, would come earnest Kaiser mandate. quite rigorous choose be, original post said sure hope rigorous possible. know Covid long term side effects. worried those? makes zero sense. talking crime though. talking invisible infection pandemic. logic totally flawed. Ha, never really *supposed* to. lie sold.  Right want choose vaccinate kids they’re eligible, that’s choice… saying “kids won’t able eat inside” asking it’s “sustainable long term” isn’t honest situation. Kids won’t able eat inside months kids able parents willing vaccinate actually be. issue don’t want vaccinate kids still want benefits vaccinated kids. Yeah gonna years line require vac card/proof?

Covidpalooza small amount population disagree. time show people continue selfish refuse vaccine, things available city. want get vaxxed? Fine. work home, go concerts/ shows, find job require (where probably test every week). Hell show multipass get tiny music club Seattle week two ago, city barely ""reopened"" too.

It's one thing seek booster first vaccine series successful want additional protection. another thing seek booster initial vaccine series provided protection. 

For immunocompromised people, there's many times listen everyone say ""Get vaccinated! Get vaccinated! Get vaccinated, gonna hospitalized/die!"" ready grab needle inject booster one else you. never say never,

Honest question: place America ""travel cost"" legitimate factor vaccination? AFAIK, vaccines readily available pharmacies. actually meant u/WagnerianMother appreciate kind words. Also hi fellow DC resident! they’re approved kids, sure. USA least, kids 12 yet approved kind COVID vaccine yet though, us parents stuck good options. 

Mine return in-person, even though schools aren’t allowed mandate masks (thanks Texas), they’ll get wearing one anyway. soon vaccine approved them, they’ll get soon possible. then, we’ll manage best can. I'm REALLY hoping gets cities (looking Chicago) same, well companies (looking place work..)

People looking weird wearing mask. photography work I'm kind middle every event happening often... Uggg. live Georgia concur. almost 2018 far schools concerned yesterday, CMS announced start gathering publicly reporting COVID vaccination rates healthcare personnel hospitals. suspect see many start issuing mandates now. It’s totally possible don’t know numbers say even wearing cloth mask provides protection. Kids neighborhood still running around outside playing masks. don’t seem bothered point. Governor told people go get vaxxed actually it. hospital numbers September. Narcissistic personality disorder! Oh god  can't directly gerrymander presidential vote either. means huge % vast majority could fall ill &amp; swamp hospitals, crowding care much needed treatments.

This already happening MO. hospital ICUs FULL non-ICU bed situation much better. Clay County, Missouri 60 adult ICU beds two hospitals. 7 available. 31.5% beds used COVID patients. need ICU bed Kansas City area, chances good going shuttled around end nowhere near home hospitals stretched thing right now.  article presenting pretty bleak picture. interviewed epidemiologist really thinks need stay current stay-home, always-masked mode *decades*? can't see society would accept that. agree also think it’s still fair say vaccines highly effective symptomatic infection. They’ve taken bit hit delta, yes, studies still showing effectiveness 80-90% range. Remember started protesting lockdowns?! still shocked happened! People demanding go get sick, look happy it! said new York, nyc. def spike cases March even increased hospitalizations that. Mar 20, 4k case, 7 day average 6k declining. 7 day average get low (6k) mid April (well one day spike affects 7 day average). Honestly don’t blame people point view last year ton huge BLM “protests” afterwards told tens thousands people close quarters marching chanting together contribute spread COVID. Also Mayors, governors even health officials pushing mandatory masks lockdowns couldn’t even attend funeral consistently violating guidelines pictured indoor dining, weddings, going vacation extended family members famously going salon banned anyone going salon barber. Basically Public officials don’t follow guidelines importantly groups Doctors make statements along lines “ It’s okay dangerous COVID wise go BLM protests, however types protests don’t condone” everything politicized people start care Call peaceful protest we’re good right? That's cool, that's choice make. Everyone's risk tolerance going different. Getting vaccinated always going end point restricting lives many millions people.   Trump anomaly due whatever weird charisma base. DeSantis strikes someone immediately alienate independents, moderates course everyone left that.

Sorry late reply, meant Australia. refused let citizens back country, delayed start thing 2020. think you’re missing several key Supreme Court legal precedents vaccine mandates early 1900s. Canada 90% city vaccine rate watched comfort couch. able watch Hulu. sure how, there.

I amazed time camera zoomed many people there.

Sure vaccines requirement hard really enforced?

All individual stuff like this, keep yourself, wear mask, get vaccinated, clean hands.

All wait out. time loosen giving covid breeding grounds mutate new strain. understand due process. Supreme Court ruled vaccine mandates legal, see Jacobson Vs. Massachusetts. various courts agreed. think due process is?  Facts agree this, theory, seeing uptick vaccinations US, especially areas hardest hit delta wave. Whether that’s spite bad media messaging though don’t know. Lol getting downvoted thinking attending event bad idea insane, own, guess. Even I'm vaccinated, want around 10k unvaccinated people close quarters. link please?  Youre wrong  Hang on. multiple studies show antibodies provide lasting immune effect. Similar vaccination effect. Also don’t know long vaccination immunity lasts - certainly bunch breakthrough cases moment Israel already 3rd jab. 

You can’t say conclusively immunity vaccinated isn’t robust mine natural  ok, let's see craft non-political reply since previous one got removed.

US would last country thing since good amount people opposed idea national ID system, presents good amount challenges places well employment verification (SSN immediately mean authorization work) Vax rate depressed 90% thought  People think know they're doing...but point unintended consequences really really hits personally don’t care someone seen outcast vaccinated. Unless they’re treated poorly person denied basic human rights, can’t empathize much. 

I’m talking real consequences. you’re hospitalized, knew data , took risk. I’m sorry, know signed for. 

The difference this. Despite viral loads similar amongst vaxxed unvaxxed, unvaxxed individuals still higher likelihood going hospital dying. affects individual, families, healthcare workers put needless stress, plunging us back restrictions. progress went them. That’s difference.  ""Could"" exactly word would use, wait next election.

His judgement day come. 3) masks mandates going effect Atlanta, blue metro areas GA? Cities barred basically anything stop spread FL due DeSantis. could upvote harder I'd broken mouse. 

I think people go easy way ""well can't talk sense anti-vaxxer maybe convince vaccinated person mask 0.01% impact"" 3) masks mandates going effect Atlanta, blue metro areas GA? Cities barred basically anything stop spread FL due DeSantis. Interesting someone old enough make vaccination decision filing taxes looking real estate opportunities LA far past. kleptocracy layers wait turn take advantage. 

Remember fast PPP money went out? even vet applications. Thankfully scumbags caught likely even close number scammers took tax money. 

Obfuscation tracing COVID data allowed areas like Florida cover severity infected population. We've open 2 weeks now. Pubs open ages since. need check box web form. else? Money. … now. Cases rise. Mid may really step 3. Downvoting sincerest form flattery reddit lot time. shows many people denial sometimes. thing though vaccinated people spreading too.

This case Delta still less likely happen vaccinated people.

I can't live like may go ahead end life point. Even 350 cases reference... kids covid necessarily died covid. 

For example least 1 kids Luukhemia died covid. Horrible parents course...but covid exactly leading cause resulted death own. pissed basically everyone, supporters not, absolute s**t show winter storms. knows losing. Us vaccinated people can't sit back nothing. virus continues spread amongst unvaccinated, matter time new variety bypasses vaccine emerges. live area younger bro (I assume he's adult), could basically try bribing taking get Johnson &amp; Johnson (one done shot) take nice meal something restrictions lifted 2 weeks ago cases still dropping. going go wrong would case would seeing signs saying otherwise. over, now. Autumn real test Mu? Uber Lyft offering free rides get free vaccine. dunno man.. seems like half Huzzah!  mean fast they’re dying, may anymore anti vax folks come 2024…… Stealing that. single person entire thread seems problem civil liberties grounds, find quite surprising equally disheartening. vaccines preventing transmission, vaccinated people still catching spreading virus others. Forcing people get vaccinated protecting society. Still are, work's busy. isn’t going massive community spread 

We 135,000 people test positive yesterday… Yup. comes lambda.  thing rails complete misrepresentation says. clearly addresses vaccine may still become endemic. downplay dismiss concerns fear mongering? risk children incredibly low. ‘09 1,800 children died H1N1 whereas 350 children died COVID total US. precautions taking place then, know anything either wealthy. *will arn't fools, people refused get vaccinated fools. even wilderness safe think every reasonable thinking person knew question pictures coming days ago. questions. Don’t universities require vaccines things like measles, etc. anyways? one work even requires flu shot students (except med exemptions). people medical exemptions campus, shouldn’t universities require regular testing everyone, vaccinated people included? That’s happening work don’t know reasoning behind testing everyone regularly universities. Besides saving money, course. we've never really made disease extinct.

The last known case smallpox 1970s. one's probably extinct due human intervention. still handful countries polio cases, that's another one expect see extincted next couple decades.

A truly ""Post-Covid"" world probably generations away due sheer size globla pandemic, ability destroy diseases. new territory us. I've learned anything year, even highly educated people terrible judges risk interpreters statistics. Again, that's true either. country law ticket checkers match ticket ID prevent resellers happening years without issue. Nowadays could simply require government issued application vaccine ID (like already happening Europe vaccine passport) checked (probably scanning QR code quick fuck) done it.

And again, reason make reject customers. that's limited rejecting someone bought ticket likely demand refund company may may pay, also rejecting customer would inside paying overpriced water, t-shirts whatnot inside. ""coming out"" nightmare. Blame ""Great Reset"" politicians getting paid contracts never made public. fear mongering since beginning. guidelines pandemic ignored. Masks introduced UK cases right middle Summer lull Winter Seasonal period. population got vaccinated? Oh no, work Delta variant.

There countries lockdown masks. lose half population? Nope, actually less deaths last 2 years everyone else.

This end population educates pandemic many Human rights taken away. death rate less 0.1% pandemic media stopped mentioning deaths focus cases. understand that's wrong, congrats, brain washed. Everyone Sturgis knew right thing fucking ignored it.  Unbelievable. Or, wish unbelievable. I'd argue security guards already underpaid, generally observe, report anything people better equipped trained deal potential violent dangerous incident.

Generally reason companies hire security guards observe document thefts trespassing. also element scaring criminals first place.

Which believe actually slight improvement terms % increase week week true. Age single biggest predictor hospitalization rate. 

The reason seeing young people hospitalized Delta spread aggressive young people less likely vaccinated. Younger people ending hospital stupidly believe need get vaccinated protect health. 

The ""good"" news hospitalization much common (relatively speaking) death 50s. 40-49 year old 2% death rate 85+, 25% hospitalization rate someone 85+. Delta around today without vaccines, would absolute bloodbath population. Many states would enter lockdown week ago.

Let’s say room 9 vaccinated people one unvaccinated person Covid. unvaccinated person coughs you. aha! vaccine! body already antibodies floating around! attack Covid virus moment enters body neutralizes it.

Now let’s say room 9 unvaccinated Covid carriers. One coughs you. immune system neutralizes it. Another one breaths you.

We’re open staying open. don’t get vaccine well tough tit  People lie vaccination status say private matter, option. huge family everyone know eachoter Never said conservatives weren’t issue Americans vaccine heistant also.
18-24 numbers terrible. accepted proof vaccination? I'm something like this, really primary concern can't imagine 20% people held onto card received. know case, ""proof vaccination"" literally white card someone writing dates pen. trivially easy fake, looks super unimportant... 

So solve issue? realized people like younger children restaurants, NYC place you! requirement indoor diners vaccinated, under-12 diners months. (Well, except rare part trials, guess.)

Lmao, actually right, fucked up, meant hospitalized die. 1 50,000 38,000 children world total (1.9 billion) could put ICU 3,000 die let run course world.

Mind you, real number probably little higher cause countries health capacities england ICU rates/need may similar death rates may way way higher worldwide total. also, corona, probably die reach hear immunity, maybe evens back down. Unless, course, worse variant comes 1.9 billion kids eligible vaccinated yet. right. there's even bigger canyon outdoor event attended vaccinated people, literally anything happened 2020. let nuance get way whatever fuck to. employees, vaccinated unvaccinated, required wear masks. Lol know live capitalist hellscape say HOSPITAL vulnerable people go get life saving care “open business” Someone probably think asking vaccinated people start wearing masks lower chances spreading it. 

Oh wait. got yelled ignoring science inconsistent. Masks benefit wearer much though, right? one else wearing masks, benefits negligible? question whether Delta different vanilla covid.  Right NSW, Australia, kids 25% cases... area quarantine.

Authoritarian responses decisive short term, become counterproductive longer term. want study topic generally, suggest comparative research done family planning different policy implementations India China, encouraging contraception versus restricting childbirth one-child policy. free personal choice people despise much. lots things choice about, like, death, taxes, acts violence us, otherwise healthy person, living US, acts towards self preservation choice. Covid killed worldwide 10x people flu usually higher lower vaccination rate US? doomed Society ducking stupid. Seriously damn right mind would think something scale good idea. Honestly cares? vaccinated there's nothing worry about. Let unvaccinated miserable time people coughing directly others eyes sharing hookahs? jesus. Yes sterilizing immunity stop virus entering body.

Nice.  reverse darwinism, modern medicine allowed people survive might otherwise nature forget ""Hard Summer"" rave California. Sure. There's word called ""underwriting"". basically assessment risk. example, smokers pay higher costs deductibles health plans, known smoking increases chances smoker get cancer. 

It's possible add ""COVID-19 vaccination received"" flag. vaccine could made pay more. completely legal private health insurance. discrimination - health assessment.  disinvite unvaccinated person, unless kid 12. cases vaccinated people getting Covid originate unvaccinated source. Maybe. UK vaccinated pretty even rate across country. lot pockets unvaccinated.

Here US, specially South, huge areas sub 40% vaccination rate still. live Louisiana, one lowest vaccination rates country. rate increased dramatically places like Baton Rouge New Orleans. parishes vaccination rate 15%.

How go blank yourself? Got it. Makes sense.  one forced. People get vaccine want to--it means they'll live lives without restaurants, bars, clubs, gyms, theatres, etc. Since 2020, fail see issue is. 

Look what's going hospitals South excellent illustration strongly encouraging people get vaxxed makes perfect sense. Virtually every single person hospital right Covid unvaxxed. True that’s terrifying Saturday, too. checked vaccine cards handed masks anyone wanted them. Nobody explicitly selling vaccine cards, like really looking them. 

I vaccinated, double masked, found nice spot friends able sit hill watch shows without getting close. time truly felt uncomfortable crowd Megan Thee Stallion showed everybody crammed (at point promptly left went smaller artist). 

Yeah people foolish crowding together front stage (especially big artists), overall festival crammed together pictures online make seem. Excelsior Pass work people live got vaccinated states like   ASSumptions are. Sorry sir/ma’am. im jealous people countries allowed festivals summer. agree. never stopped wearing mask indoors unless knew fact everyone vaccinated. people afford go eat restaurant enough bus ride, ask friends/family ride, work Lyft Uber giving free rides people get vaccine sites.  reddit optimists saying that, good understanding UK dropping. vax rates masking fact students school?

I'm sure January February could get vaccine.

Anyways, vaccinated still contract virus. seem pretty behind ""the science"". purely political comment caused reply removed?  time/distance. distance decreases, exposure goes up.   suggesting asymptomatic infections equally contagious?
 
That may may true, evidence one way other? never suggested differently True, can't say conclusively opposite true. said, jury still that, there's definitely suspicion new Delta variant may render earlier studies (which involved variants) moot.

Driving car dangerous COVID vaccinated. “grow society” banning driving despite fact necessary? live life fear never leave house, life isn’t worth living. add onto this, town recorded [114% vaccination SpaceX? Falcon 9 rocket loaded delta V.

(seriously hope put /s case) lot old people meet coffee muffins every single morning lol. pulling funding school districts mandate masks pandering far right forces people uneeded risk Uh oh *Could*, like sun *could* bring warmth cloudless summer afternoon I’m getting married October probably going well. require masking everyone kicking people don’t comply. I’m really fence even wedding live Texas crazies. police guests wedding insane hate it. Right, comment vaccinated people lead less death?

I’m sure person responded implied people able get vaccine don’t. 

You could always ask clarification. Well then, stand corrected. Florida's bioterrorist chief mention masks, stipulate concept source control.

1) mean specifically unvaccinated individuals? know updated recommendations wearing mask vaccinated area high vaccination kinda overkill?

2) saw Sanjay Gupta CNN saying something along lines masks would “put fire”, without specification. supposed believe talking shitty cloth masks despite contagious, disease airborne?

I feel like slippery slope vaccines don’t equal dwgree freedom, thing people always talk about, turn people away it. least that’s vibe I’m getting people I’ve heard talking it. Yeah sure, there's one way skin cat ambitious others. think fairly reasonable say CDC expected people going want make cat stew point, maybe gotten us cat instead hamster. hamster might work, really we're looking for. 
 
That analogy got grotesque intended risk situational contextual. vaccinated person still lower risk unvaccinated people second example, even though they're higher risk first scenario. deliberately obtuse legitimately dimwitted. Students County virtual one quarter last year, Teachers treated like disposable, ridiculed concerns, demanded, essentially bullied parents, local political leaders. ""They'll coughing lives Libertarian paradise."" -- Ronald ""Coolio"" DeSantis Great silver lining there. lot described applies homeless people, imagine fact tough time surviving. realized don’t smart rich. Can’t believe people believe misinformation facts. include bars nightclubs? vaxxed not

But mostly not. course not, understand vaccinated still vector transmission.

This true Delta, vaccinated people still far less likely infected, even Delta. Less infections = less transmission = less mutations

With high enough vaccination rates, COVID become endemic still far fewer chances mutation. Why‘d still go then? small chance thing happening event, event large number times, chances thing happening suddenly aint small anymore. yet media keeps treating though everyone getting breakthroughs equally contagious.

It's getting ridiculous. community leaders either busy sucking Orange, illiterate anything dealing bottom line. I'm sure fine realize tons people CANNOT take vaccine, right? feel like I’m shouting void think it’ll thing it. seems like one biggest hurdles nationalized healthcare infrastructure infrastructure built vaccine passports really makes excuses moot.

On flipside, think reason haven’t vaccine passport told use cards explicitly supposed proof proof vaccination government playing hot potato massive cost building nationalized health database insane overhaul Windows 98 ass systems individual state seems run databases DMV vaccination records What’s deal lambda stuff? I’ve seen it’s resistant also don’t know what’s real what’s fear mongering. want stop feeling afraid like there’s end. Ok, agree there. stress healthcare system overlooked. anything else?

I actually *want* convinced take it, huge doubter. factor apparent lack long-term data mRNA therapy affects body. point data would appreciate it. Covid never terrifying entire population completely immunologically naive it. variants going go small steps, yes they'll take enough small steps get sick one even vaccinated, never take gigantic leap ""circulate god knows long among animals, creating new variants bypass immunity again, finally colliding humans."" difference 10 feet time versus miles time. Covid-19 never leap miles circulates among us.

So yeah get sick covid variants rest life, like getting sick colds flu whole life. big deal. 70% America, actually called whatboutism.

This apparently decree DeBlahsio. disgusting abuse power mandate private businesses must refuse service, even business owners will. creates division, anger, ""us vs them"" mentality. pro vaccine vaccinated myself, would patronize business enforces vaccine passport. Ughh. Well guess better masked zoom fact chose book Disney world trip mandated masks last week articles like come things fraction fraction percent killing you?

Funny using exact arguments antivaxxers do. feel way. I'm VA, County starts School couple weeks. 2 12 year olds. matter time. ridiculous. never go away Feel free call email giant asshole let know feel :)  shortcuts? Duration immunity 

""To date, antibody persistence demonstrated 8 months COVID-19 infection 6 months 2nd mRNA vaccine dose""

 Slide 18 - still trying review data third shot seems potentially beneficial especially 65 yo based Pfizer's data. (11fold increase antibody titers - note numbers; scale).

Pfizer's slide deck (see page 27 Delta data): acquaintance tell covid positive relative knowingly got airplane go home. (not lolla) 

They're still shitty vaccinated people deserving blame.

But find hard blame lolla. happened, government prevented it.

The vaccinated could. see UK government Covid things opened July 19th. Plenty time effect fed cases now.  believe companies don’t even recommend 6 months second shot.. that’s something consider. Health care workers started getting vaccinated December also something consider :/ pretty detailed article recent. ran major manufacturing issues. point, seem clear planning asking FDA approval. still working though! 50% vaccianted created roadblocks virus, though?

So virus 50% chance meeting immune host every time jumps.

That cut transmission, right? deserve award that. Pity can't give one. Take upvote instead. antibodies/immunity factor passes, exactly? Many scientists consider probable many 1-in-3 Americans infected already. Natural immunity extremely well, re-infection hospitalization death. Refusing acknowledge cheering passport pretty absurd. Proof vaccination required tho isn’t it? problem unvaccinated, always been. cares. point stop caring given resources protect choose except literally never happened vaccines. longest took discover adverse effects past months, testing going vaccines nearly year (and almost 20 years MRNA vaccines general!)

is ZERO risk? no. couple people died dozen adverse reactions, that's millions millions doses. meanwhile, covid killed 600K USA alone, including like 100K people high risk groups.

i'll take chances ""newish"" vaccine miniscule side effects, astronomically small chance weird side effect popping 20 years vs something killing ton people sure.

aren't worried side effect covid long term disability death? certainly be, also worried much smaller chances side effects vaccine Dude, work place 3-6,000 visitors per day. (Over half unvaccinated young kids. Barely half adults city vaccinated.)

I enough people half hour shift.

If could spend hours entirely alone save occasional visits friends family I’d thrilled.

Masking public least anyone could do. 90% visitors **don’t it** work. local hospitals urgent cares full covid patients getting treated anything immediate life threatening injury almost impossible.

My staff vaccinated masked continue long CDC deem wise. Ope that’s embarrassing part, think you’re actually correct. Mixed another Israeli study suggested 50% efficacy 60 (on similarly awful analysis).

Texas Florida last week produced 1/3 COVID cases America. Also, state open Delta grabbed foothold US. Also, peak right higher last summer even though little Johnny spends every weekend Pop Pop Nana New Mexico State University requiring university system employees fully vaccinated end September take weekly COVID-19 tests. university says currently working plan implement new requirement. also working figure documentation accepted proof vaccination showing negative COVID result. Good searching information open mind! please let point *after* there's vaccine kids. much longer tried repeatedly come short. really want see myself. believe official number 200,000 people fully vaccinated caught Covid. 165,000,000 Americans fully vaccinated. appreciate clarity assistance. also apologize seems like I’m trying fight anyone.

Every hour lady lake hospital. article mentions 45 hospitals city. seems like lot. googled think lady lake 270 icu beds. would fill 10 days. sad.

Waiting two months second dose best. Funny. mom went McDonald's today one wore mask. manager must dismissed it. strictly speaking true

Only selectively quoted part. full biggest easily quantifiable factor because** ""you never get odds exactly spot nobody else exactly like you"" straight dumb.  one Scotland. know Israel reported I'm sure ever released study proper format.

I pointing idiocy gathered Lollapalooza without mask sight hospitalizations soar.
Whoosh understand mean, but, got vaccine told least (J&amp;J) 75% effective reality revealed 75% tested sample positive. That's concerning, it?

I think understanding. example assumes 90% effective vaccine, 65% people got COVID vaccinated. two different uncomparable numbers. 

The CDC stated 75% got COVID vaccinated, 75% tested sample. get antibodies havibg COVID-19 2020 Moderna 2021. So.... hopefully ""memory cells""....🤞 Can't happen without act Congress. ACA forbids discrimination except reasons specifically outlined bill. Yep scares heck me. deadly variant arises. Well vaccinating us stop course global world . unlikely guess still ...with speed current variants arose..it makes gloomy speculation think it.

At least covid prion disease! No, missing joke commenter making. KN95 works great. come cool colors prints.  Lmao entire thread bash Desantis. gonna remove too? take minute appreciate far we've come quickly? Things really bad globally Delta, pandemic started, optimistic reality-based projections us vaccine 18 months -- would around September October 2021. Instead many hundreds millions people around world fully vaccinated start August. immense inequalities terms access, imo always going struggle ensure vaccine equity. least main challenges face sociopolitical scientific. Clearly nonsense. last week county 74% infected fully vaccinated. UK reports half current hospitalizations vaccinated.

Even vaccine makers claimed 96% protection. wife got J&amp;J early March 5 months got Pfizer booster last Sunday. sure would fall study assuming AZ J&amp;J similar even though AZ seems effective. Either way celebrating fact took upon get booster especially Delta hitting hard. Maybe couple months get 2nd Pfizer shot. argue main point, 0.04% breakthrough infections per vaccinated person, per known exposure like chicken pox example.

If history indication, things get much worse get better (mainly anti-vaxxers). I'm biggest fan doctors, usually top undergrad class, medical training takes minimum 5 years (and 14 years more). Nurses (with respect) not.

You decide knows talking regards vaccines. Always have. Here's one thing seen broken down, ever, anyone: vaccination race age together. Examples would important:

80% people 65 fully vaccinated. 18% white people 65, 10% black people 65.

I can't find number precisely many people 30 vaccinated half ADULTS 30 fully vaccinated, obviously 12 eligible all. 38% white people 46% black people 30.

Race known 63% vaccination, per CDC, extrapolate get 53% white people fully vaccinated 40% black people fully vaccinated. *About half difference explained solely 8% white population 65 instead 30.* believe I've defined either way. I've mostly pointed rather simplistic way looked gap shown someone could tell opposite story using exact data.

You're much getting defensive trying scuttle conversation likely ever even considered looking way.

It's like playing basketball. go 20-5 first quarter. End 3rd quarter rolls around 60-43. Sure, deficit gotten bigger, think would agree we've played substantially better 2nd 3rd quarters. Either TX FL. God help you, either way. 99.999% ratio given 'breakthrough infections vaccinated people' 'sum total vaccinated people'. '99.999%' implies super safe vaccinated. want know 'ratio breakthrough infections vaccinated people' 'number vaccinated people exposed Delta'. There's Israeli study suggests figure like 66%, suggesting fully vaxed get legit exposure Delta 1-in-3 chance become infected... whereas '99.999%' figure suggests, pay attention, 1-in-10,000 chance infected. scary thing is: He's incompetent, **he knows exactly he's doing.** way mass shootings God emperor Obama trump isn’t responsible everything loser.

Again ask this, needed measure needs done everywhere. places others make enough difference. Disagree. Parents average even hesitant vaccinate children themselves. fact, many people know healthcare extremely worried exactly this. rate uptake likely going rise slightly age group becomes eligible. new data show?
The CDC cited new data outbreak month Barnstable County, Mass., 69% eligible residents vaccinated. 469 cases tied gatherings restaurants, bars vacation homes, 74% breakthrough infections people fully vaccinated. Among 133 viral samples genetically sequenced, 90% caused Delta variant offshoot strain.

The confidential CDC document also cites discouraging reports breakthrough cases India, Delta variant first detected. viral loads vaccinated people became infected Delta higher viral loads vaccinated people became infected coronavirus strains, reports found.

The growing evidence Delta’s propensity cause breakthrough infections sure complicate efforts persuade vaccination holdouts roll sleeves COVID-19 shots — challenge anticipated authors CDC document.

Going forward, health officials “improve [the] public’s understanding breakthrough infections” stop “describing breakthrough cases ‘rare’ ‘small percentage’ cases,” document says.

The right side gave like flat tire 😂🙊💀 thinking this, trying Dockett picture card phone can't imagine gathering like this; would anxious. I'm still cautious around family. 70% American adults taken one dose? Thought read somewhere recently . account minors though Digital Vaccine Passports way America. Queue Lolla variant   Tbf, sorts people think meat packing workers deserve hurting. get life threatening illness want get tanked public? Get fucked people think COVID scam sure easily scammed. I've cold 2 weeks. Tested negative. Anecdotal data? Yes. possible everyone have. ""These types menstrual disorders also normally common."" many people receive vaccine, many people also report menstrual disorders, might otherwise also had. 

Much ado nothing. That’s story. guess we’ll see well works Yea honestly everything completely normal PA. one seems care anymore. Vaccinated unvaccinated I’m saying wrong route go down, I’m amazed year half we’ve gone historically weary government happy government mandating us show papers allowed enter private businesses. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks! people dumb traveling there? cases control quite time. delta hit Again, anecdotal know many fully vaccinated people catching covid symptoms, friends know people, co workers.

I think 88% really solid preventing hospitalization/death, cannot believe 88% efficacy rate preventing catching covid period. That’s mere 7 percent difference Alpha covid **unbelievably** rare catch covid period Delta came around.

I appreciate explanation though, time tell. Let bears pay bear tax! Iirc news seeing less breakthroughs Moderna long covid too. 

I went er, hey doc i’ve covid 2 months.

Doctor: possible. losing patience unvaccinated _employer_.  found different job. gotten vaccinated Moderna back March, many people know getting breakthrough infections, I’m tempted walk pharmacy ask Pfizer shot say I’m unvaccinated get cross reactivity booster immunity. Gonna heading back college soon looking forward increasingly exposed. can't agree something make someone ""bad person"". fact seeing substantial disconnect cases hospitalizations odd, right chart. keep arguing go up. Well shit, course go up. UK Delta case wave equivalent 80% winter peak. Yet hospitalizations peaked somewhere around 20% winter peak. need upset, agree disagree. frown judgment anyone would go Olive Garden. Especially in, places, New York City. I’m curious well. Nobody really reported good stats recently previous infection previous infection + vaccine. think it’s fair say previous infection provides protection her. I’m sure previous infection + vaccine probably better vaccine infection, haven’t seen anything it. 

Also, makes feel better, remember people getting sick day compared population whole. she’s sick right now, odds catches next days still low. might better chance catching someone vaccinated, like .04% people United States (varies live) catching COVID day.  “They’re making decisions basis extremely weak unreliable data, time necessary work reduce uncertainty among population,” said Vinay Prasad, physician professor Department Epidemiology Biostatistics University California, San Francisco. “When isn’t lot study data, CDC conducting studies.”

I think problem. provide example happened within America hasn’t racially motivated. examples provided solid hold opinion. I’m American History forced white citizens something. i'm respiratory therapist aka person runs ventilators hospitals offering 15k bonus make switch. we've lost lot rts job hospital system either can't pay more.  Yeah. 1.5 years ago. Yeah virus never going away. yearly thing, new mutation, like influenza virus. We'll need get vaxed every year along side flu shot. could happen us heard COVID. vaccine almost guaranteed get life threatening case know kids getting covid school

I read last year, long kids following protocol (masked required seated 6 ft away) consider schools source contact trace anything. guess assume catching school impossible never look it, one ever catch school! best understanding, Delta variant infectious, necessarily severe/lethal. Mild symptoms typically come organ damage, understand correctly - typically reserved ICU cases. 

The antibodies vaccine still effective Delta variant. unknown effective they'll future variants, literally mutations. 

Multiple exposures/infections COVID, best knowledge, studied see one's body better able handle future infections, that's necessarily known. whole concept vaccines teaching body handle virus variants operate similarly, giving weakened/dead variants train against. 

Is better hunker get Delta now? Difficult choice needs personal family. general, kids hit hard COVID, unless existing respiratory issues like asthma. Even then, less bad adults. argument made kids fine send school. 

But hunkering exposing way helps prevent spread virus, gives fewer chances mutate new variant. argument could also made staying home civic duty times. 

Ultimately, choice yours. what's right family. literally mean anything. carrier undetectable amount virus you. Who's say vaccinated person contract covid way concert gas station. know vaccine stop getting covid, lessens effects disease. infection spread non-vaccinated concert goers. think missed point picked home tests reason. want a-hole thought allergies spread covid around. perfect, reasonable precaution take.

I agree though, government sending out, home tests bit pricey. Yeah, hoping Walter Mondale type stomping.  don’t think HIPAA anything religious exemptions, sure coming from. HR guidance document read says employer request additional information, basically burden proof (that employee’s faith held sincerely) lies employer. Ultimately comes employee requesting religious exemption, employer grant it. “rigorous vetting”. Public Health Mandates Union Demands Agreed. “Mild” isn’t sniffles - it’s clinical description - need hospitalization supplemental oxygen. Plus long Covid still thing

We might surprised find Israel finding significant long Covid ~20% breakthroughs.

Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 page 11 report. log odds confidence interval long Covid (after two shots) goes .4:1 nearly 1:1. Meaning risk long Covid hard pin fully vaccinated could help substantially slightly reduce risk 3.2 million people UK thought long Covid Good luck haven’t realized people sick antivaxers killing people keeping virus alive. us stopped super nice it. could've already come contact someone, recently enough show yet. going test route, best probably test days rapid test gate kids happy. read post children virtual learning within district self reported happy well. tracks back home life though many children provided. think easy postulate parents want believe children must classroom can't deal home either financially logistically. need classroom want lives bit easier? anyone know full list everything going received what? approach

you mean approach saved lives? People play fantasy football weeks, suddenly become “statisticians” mini-Nostradamus’s gyms restaurants bars clubs? cares? get cold literally matter happy large scale events so? Exactly. knew outcome without even read book. Extremely doubtful US comes anywhere close previous hospitalization totals, maybe individual states might, overall, chance. Yes are.

You don’t need test everybody understand much work IFR. Representative samples suffice.

And look cases compared deaths, see IFR whack. Yep, past year half made completely lose hope comes climate change. living deadly pandemic people dying real time yet nobody change behaviors stop it, idea people would proactive come together prevent something happen future seems impossible me. wish never kids. majority people *did* take it.  Let's face it, we've moved on. People want vaccine moved start us vaccinated well. going bend backwards anymore protect made choice. 

While feel bad children 12 choice get vaccine, is. Pretty sure I'm commenting handwaving statement ""kids resilient"" when, know, childhood trauma *is thing*.

And case going light pushing nebulous agenda, got vaccine months ago still wear mask stores, there's much push would still say prudent wear mask. mean, really expecting event Fred Durst performing filled medically conscious people? 80 percent still incredibly effective Yay science! Vaccination get pandemic 🙌 city irresponsible since june shouldnt blame irresponsible least vaccinated age group gathering thousands music festival thats lame since decade. Hah, get annoyed help wanted signs go full user name people jobs people don’t like. Kids fine, go home interact community. Really appreciate thank you! vaccinations forced. Oh deer... Statistics shown states cut extra unemployment benefits early see results getting people back work states didn't, that's bullshit excuse. Excelsior app much ugh. least somewhat outdoor aspect. But...ya Shakespeare definition tragedy, predictable outcome based character flaws. Great news!

I hope visiting UK end year (open borders vaxxed already!) feel much safer result this; wish government would courage thing! confused you’re implying. currently quarantining taking Covid test tomorrow. didn’t bring Delta variant festival won’t leave quarantine get negative test. Police force take breathalyzer test *because suspect committed crime*. Otherwise unreasonable search seizure, protected 4th amendment. comparing Covid test breathalyzer would imply definitely legal since Bill Rights kinda big deal. (IANAL maybe there's different legal argument.) go PF fitness almost daily. hoping expecting staff look proof keep wallet. hated spoke truth family sick seems like cold. husband getting tested today. We'll see. add husband vaccinated. Daughter due age. might surprised find Israel finding significant long Covid ~20% breakthroughs.

Meaning risk long Covid hard pin fully vaccinated could help substantially slightly reduce risk ridiculous. Live life

Seen people die Covid also seen breakthrough infection. fun. understand anyone would attitude. Maybe alone, one cares you, never learned care others, rest us responsible adults can't go ""live life"" expense everyone around me. catch Covid, vaccinated adult, going put commission couple weeks alone would huge dick move burden wife, kids, parents, business partners, clients, on. really need grow stop selfish. Get vaccine, wear mask, minimize spread. Tracking vaccination abysmal. Tons fully vaccinated people getting letters saying missed second dose need come back get it. Remember going ""contact tracing"" lol... Vaccinated people much less likely get infected, unless reproduction value goes zero say 75% full vaccination, people aren’t going wear masks more, public health restrictions literally stolen 18 months lives, dems can’t run continued health restrictions. injecting reality here. one positive thing take article like seems like nobody died. 6-8 months ago whenever saw story family get-together spawned Covid cases, someone almost always died result course back nobody fully vaccinated. Worth noting:

- schools already fully open months, people concerned kids getting part

- we've already delta wave 50% higher cases previous wave, deaths reached average 13 per day.

-The wave seemingly passed cases 28% peak.

-over 90% Scottish adults antibodies project 90% adults get fully vaccinated, must one highest world. someone explain 30% left we're still shitty situation? mean? virus affect host less time? variant break last long variant outbreaks? family gathering coming up, one cousin coming Arizona whose politics, though extreme, make somewhat worry attitude vaccinations. 
Everybody else, I’m sure vaccinated. 

I’m going ask brother inquire h vaccination status. Please list vaccines get milder form illness rather full immunity.

I mean, [the CDC directly says one benefits getting flu vaccine milder experience Maybe I'm much layman, seems like they're saying benefit milder experience illness even fall short providing full vaccination shown several studies reduce severity illness people get vaccinated still get 2017 study showed flu vaccination reduced deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, ICU length stay, overall duration hospitalization among hospitalized flu 2018 study icon showed among adults hospitalized flu, vaccinated patients 59 percent less likely admitted ICU vaccinated. Among adults ICU flu, vaccinated patients average spent 4 fewer days hospital vaccinated. Vaccination may ease symptoms long converted CAD USD Im postmenopausal symptoms vaccinations. first thoughts hearing study type stress responsible cycle changes. stress prior year super precautions somewhat feeling relief vaccinations? possible factor cases.   vaccinated people so…

they lower rate thus much safer environment.

How unfair rules put place try establish safety get pandemic versus unfair people fucking died covid. Hope great time sickness experienced 30-min Tweezer jam ;) Also, there's lot covid Louisiana, Mississippi Delta located. people left festival, would able effectively spread disease, point. they? Fully vaxxed people still spread New research showed vaccinated people infected the [Delta tremendous amounts virus nose throat, said email responding questions New York better now?  ""china app bad, google app good"" think people watch baseball without cheering jeering? lmao Thin herd baby! middle ground maskless around unvaccinated people, original guidance vaccinated people cases started going dramatically. Additionally, people need realize COVID going anywhere complete isolation healthy. like sorry people gotta die.

Not really. vaccine unbelievably effective death. 160M vaccinated Americans 1,300 died covid.

If unwilling mandate get vaccine (and, clear, think mandate get vaccine), many *are going to* die, *have to* die--they could get jab.

We shutting things protect people refuse protect themselves. B/c there's metric shit ton rednecks Florida, fucking love man. Like, want suck love. ""Sky blue,"" experts reveal. protests attended, everyone wore masks stayed separated. six feet, certainly crowded Lollapalooza, almost one wearing masks. they’re outside, help keep infections down. Well suppose tells businesses closed current orders find different line work think going find, concerned taking shortcuts established procedures. fair, first I've heard Chicago full capacity sports games time Lollapalooza. think reason people pointing Lollapalooza event pretty shocking. Baseball games might full capacity they're packed like sardines. national reproduction rate already heading down. cases lagging indicator. 

We broken back thing. Remember, every recovered case gives immunity (in otherwise healthy people) similar efficacy mRNA vaccines. 

There Delta boom deaths UK Israel. Cases go up. Maybe deaths touch. gotten rid dry timber already. I'm disagreeing you, symptomatic covid currently, fully vaccinated. got another fully vaccinated symptomatic person, father law (doctor think covid get tested went get tested). spouse got symptomatic covid spouse too.

Out 5 people 4 got symptomatic covid, fully vaccinated. Granted pretty moderate, I'm unlucky one. Luckily severe, damn still seems like spreading amongst us pretty damn easy vaccinated catch it, spread delta. vaccine still 80 plus percent effective. Hmmm.  link? I'm really researching anything. wondering PRC reports positive tests, since trying understand PRC numbers cases related numbers outside PRC. 

You said cited article, article nothing reporting positive tests. mean I’d argue it’s great take vaccine someone else could use you’re already pretty well-protected. It’s lot like toilet paper hoarding serious scale. Don’t take need. SHOW VAX PROOF MOM DAD! AHHHHHH ! DON’T BELIEVE YOU!!! Im trying help ease panic. logic he’d need fall cliff recognize bridge necessary. here. Even worse, made decision enrollment state run home school/virtual learning closed, enough money budget virtual learning local level anymore. small number loud antimask/antivax parents. mind proof vaccination wish provided better system awkwardly large piece paper easy forge.

…

Get vaccines people. :) vaccine helps body fight infection vaccinated person infected, doesn’t stop getting infected first place. Masks social distancing worn best way general population avoid getting infected first place. Chicagoland resident...have never gone never go Lollapalooza...haha. annoyed Lightfoot allowing Lolla, sees spike cases, shuts city again. read article? Fake vaccine papers. People using public transport without face masks mandated Chicago... right information came delta changed plans. seem feel personally attacked got vaccinated protect others can’t. always fragile? difficult understand since infected infect others... Yes viral load varies conditions situations conducive transmission... wide discrepancies. brief look comments reddit suggest far prevalent ""extremely rare"". bit like reports reinfection time last year data relating children catching covid last September. probably right, many businesses mandating employees customers.

There quite list bars/restaraunts req. proof vax. I’m hoping don’t see employees abused assaulted way mask requirements.

Employers might then… simply enforce mandates. Whoo!! right article. nurses scalping prices pandemic. different gas station charging 7 bucks gallon. nursing costs blow away budget set. though. Unvaccinated people huge problem driving force behind pandemic. vaccinated people immediately dropped masks tried go back 2019 also huge vector behind current surge. lots us posting since January, vaccines amazing sufficient deal COVID own. Vaccines plus measures like masks public settings distancing possible needed drive case numbers background levels. Another two weeks flatten curve. also people selling vaccine cards right outside gates. guess - wont be. Unless signs break (this goes Lollaplooza too, Im hoping CDC least tries given media around it).

No way P-Town large 4th July gathering/party country. got attention outbreak can’t yet vaccinate kids 12, even wanted to. testing completed, vaccine likely approved emergency use kids 12. 

But here’s idea… talk kids’ pediatrician vaccine follow advice. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article matter tho? Well, shit. many morons. fact allowed happen points terrible leadership country.  previous measures, also vaccine. expecting check people sneaking festival? Completely agree. would much rather living China US. US, essentially form mild lockdown since beginning, going us never safe going China lockdown. Maybe covidiots get vaccine follow masking guidelines children start dying significant numbers. 

Maybe.

But honestly doubt it. one contradicts that. knows sure got caught not, “kids sneaking music festivals” isn’t exactly uncommon normal years. really need ""officials"" anymore? people issued press release vaccine effectiveness, efficacy. 

[Vaccine efficacy vaccine effectiveness measure proportionate reduction cases among vaccinated persons. Vaccine efficacy used study carried ideal conditions, example, clinical trial. Vaccine effectiveness used study carried typical field (that is, less perfectly controlled) methods used earlier Lancet article. hysterectomy late 30's clues there. Less 10000 deaths 40. little 12, died influenza. Children fine. Unfortunately 6 year old can’t get vaccinated yet full ass adults running around unvaccinated fucking nightmare basically vaccine. overthink it. there's multiple strains influenza floating around scientists science thing determine prevalent season? I’m sales usually two 3 hour presentations per day, masked entire time except sip water. It’s initially little awkward uncomfortable, get used it. understand US least allow people want third doses get instead tossing them. Back getting vaccine hard people allowed get one yet due age/category able get end day left doses. wasting doses? l
My mental health plummeted point i’ve hospitalized moderate amount. I’m full time student (not online) part time course pay sufficiently. believe unemployment blessing disguise currently considered poverty line anymore. i’m graduated receiving full time job w/ 40-60 hours. remember thought vaccine majority people would gladly take it. naive fool. IMAX-level projection. People champion laws actually work meat packing. Children ICUs normally come brain damaged, no. study shows associated covid, ICU. know many people (no live there, I'm around it) faked vaccination cards. know around 8, I'm sure there's comp vaccinated teacher cost tests would want go carrot instead. Africa think disband CDC make part WHO, least seem willing speak sooner stronger ideas. everyone needs vaccinated get good herd immunity going. IIRC, 70-90% population.

There lot people can't get vaccine, nearly enough matter herd immunity. Children also harder time contracting virus, that's worth factoring portion population, acts almost like pseudo contribution herd immunity.

To add this, could conceivably get vaccine approved use adolescents. sure you’re downvoted truth? get one! tell anyone else know hasn’t vaccinated get one. need get past this, it’s numbers people vaccinated. Thanks Never left That's messaging clear: Since many members communities vaccinated continued threat freedoms, health, liberties, must wear masks resolved.""

&amp;#x200B;

Messaging point DIRECTLY non vaxxers cause. Good! hope Chicago follows suit, already bars restaurants requiring it, would nice blanket requirement. Man, remember Astros games starting up, crowds packed, lost track many people around saying “Darwin’s gonna give Texas rude awakening weeks!”

….And cases continued remain extremely low.

Good times

Of course, say Abbott good job (he’s not) Texas safe spot (due low vaccination rates, unvaccinated not), sub really best track record predicting Super-spreader events concern. reason still continuous bull shit paycheck. would leave healthcare heartbeat didn’t go school job have. Honestly don’t care understandable feeling have, making public benefits / things people need survive, contingent vaccination status (or anything else) dicey slope. believe give people things need survive unconditionally, even hate little bit. Even they’re legitimately assholes. read it’s NYC’s app, NYS’s excelsior, paper. booster hasn’t developed, produced delivered. Eh, according various websites, kids 10 make anywhere 12-20% Americans. cleared able it. There’s plenty viral videos Hb dress kids sneaking there.. parents died 20s. logic, must common phenomenon. surprise massive teacher shortage especially special education. especially true paraprofessionals make far less pay fields. Fact union realize vaccine mandate means decent amount school workers leave dont method replace them

The school work recently reached 60% vaccinated. last 40% confident least half would quit instead getting vaccine politics sadly. cannot replace high number think you’re vastly underestimating severity “cold”

Pretty commonly it’s 10 days wiped mostly bed. That's centralized system used track stuff. would beyond easy implement system QR code (and corresponding code put forms etc) would used look anyone's status. use pretty much anything. vax-hes anti-vax people see lives harder choices, vaccinated able much smoothly, greater incentive anything get shot. certainly seems stretch say coincidental! Colorado, stop BS. Thats fucking bare minimum ask festival hundreds thousands people happening second year global pandemic.

The bare minimum faked, bought impossible enforce. news broadcast dint link Supposed going Blue Ridge Rock Fest September. I'm bit nervous delta variant, even fully vaccinated. I've talked going couple times. right now, still plan going. miss live music, miss energy concert small club craziness festivals. read pamphlet came medication take taken years 2 pages (front back) possible side effects.

I still take medication experienced two pages side effects. actually asked Doctor said similar said patient reports side effect verified added list, mean people experience side effect. Well fucking duh like pirate bury booty. Tots pears. 🙏🏼 Ahhh. Good point. Massachusetts like 60% infections vaccinated people. getting hospitalized dying.

if thats ptown numbers dont think thats normal setting... theres much social distancing bear week ptown, least depending go...its normal conditions sure Yeah I've almost lost mine already. Going eat restaurant worth hassle trying bring card place. I'm fine cooking working home, getting food weights to-go. they? need figure way accept/understand states' apps, no? done so, get tested right away. Sadly this. link?

IIRC, Pfizer much widely administered Moderna, US around world. would stand reason would breakthrough cases. partner misses periods anytime gets sick. don’t happen every woman, body stress delaying periods well documented medical literature. guess aside cases happening US. We're kinda tracing, technically correct say traced back spikes games, sure sus we're spikes people gathering stadiums. How's religious exemption work preventing exemptee getting covid? 

I admit I'd nervous told ""yes, good hands, 100% staff hospital vaccinated covid."" ""Except religious exemptions"".


Ok great, umm last part again.



What seems problem officer? religious exemption red lights speed limits right here. That's thought sounds like person fully vaccinated. point, return normal life. way get vaccinated (and mask get past this). person fully vaccinated think deserve ire going outdoor music festival. whole point nearly effective people thing, originally report 95-98% effectiveness.

I know think opinion important actual medical professionals saying breakthrough infections rare. I’ve learned anything past 2 years there’s massive number people seem enjoy getting sick want make sure many people around suffer too. 1) COVID flu 2) flu fucking sucks. that’s become apparent spread deliberate actions inconsiderate, selfish people frustrates hell me. Also none bans work. Go look MASSIVE number people anti-lockdown / anti-fax subs bragging faking tests fax cards. lose - lose. It’s really sad freedom care freedom cough waitress. fuck, kid want performer spit mouth?!?! Fucking gross hell 🤦‍♂️. making things upset now. vaccinations US free sent 100 million 3rd world countries since many idiots refuse take shot would gone bad didn’t give away. Vaccine mandate easier enforce mask mandate. constantly people keep masks wear get checked door take inside. like vaccinated door checked sneakily become unvaccinated inside.  Certain places can't/won't fear people quitting creating even bigger worker shortage before. kids 12? underrated comment Two issue mandate . 1) card easy fake. probably 30 minutes. 2) seeing many smaller business enforcing it. staff cost business. actually set — wonder would even accept masked up. vaccinated. socially distanced. everything suppose to. I’m going enjoy days subreddit is. control. frame strange ways, always means, ""lets open back without vaccinations"". Statistics science though, rare we’ve told extremely statistically unlikely know two breakthrough cases symptoms, yet do. Makes easier blame September's lockdown crap coming regardless there? OK wait 90 days got sick get better? NJ Docket app. Get it. So. want make sure stance clear - even though delta variant spreading alarming rate US large gatherings outdoor concert tens thousands people breeding ground variant spread cause people get sick die - completely okay this?

I'm suggesting going back 2020's level closures outdoor concert tens thousands people gather probably cancelled. Biden PA, MI WI almost 300,000 votes.

Then AZ GA good measure.

Oh dems flipped 4 (!) Senate seats across AZ GA.

It close Right on. feel sad vaccinated people get virus due idiots, unvaccinated people die? ""I told ya so!"" me. sympathy. Yep, predict genetic drift prevalent upcoming season There's also small point that, (unless I'm mistaken) boosters formally studied. 

The original protocol two shots delivered 3 4 weeks apart. know data dosage schedule vaccine safe. might very, confident third shot safe, strictly speaking, experiment test that. Yup agree. lean republican side. right. It'll probably fine. fine. national mandate. dangerous employees. right put them. didn’t realize sub in. started read headline figured Singapore Olympic team disqualified doping. don’t think enough data yet determine breakthrough infections generally asymptomatic. also don’t think necessarily good data presymptomatic versus symptomatic spread I’m sure good job categorizing people have, instance, light headaches mild fatigue, mildly sore/scratchy/tickly throats, slight nausea loose stools, minimally tender/sore glands, etc., symptomatic, rather presymptomatic. kinds things symptoms, don’t think consistently get recognized such, especially people baseline poor health poor lifestyle habits. Boom. saying since first time heard parents complaints schools closed.

The majority people complaining schools closed families adults wfh. People vaccinated still getting spreading it. Honestly, vaccinated people responsible people, control go everything way unvaccinated do? Like going help mitigate than?  media gets ratings clicks scaring people, yet people fall again. especially laughable considering *very* effective vaccines.

The super spreading happening preparing get fucked manipulative media. Lollapalooza finished… festival season here. Lots “hugging” going maybe they’re cousins unsettling considering much serious COVID potential long-term side effects. realize 70% pretty fucking pitiful right? Who, point, looking Texas going “Yea, that’s way go”?

Lol NY accept state digital passes? least tristate pass! know wasn’t safe medical professionals visit completely uneducated parts Africa Ebola outbreak, locals would kill doctors due misguided beliefs ab Ebola comes from?

Anyway, random anecdote. Nothing anything here. nearly 60000 18% ages 0-5 Agreed. set little field/overflow hospitals stick Covid patients those. sense clogging medical system. isolate folks hopefully pull through. Also people die denominator goes down, though currently organization reporting like that. county Alabama highest they’re since March 2020. 32% test positive. still know people refusing vaccinated. curiosity… why?

When CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said last week people wear masks indoors areas “substantial” levels Covid-19 transmission, instance, said evidence shows Delta variant might spread easily vaccinated people become infected unvaccinated. CDC pointed Provincetown, Mass., said large gatherings July bars, nightclubs house parties led hundreds Covid-19 infections. studies released weekend backed CDC’s conclusion, Dr. Walensky said. 
 
The Provincetown data contained two startling details: nearly three-quarters infected people fully vaccinated, CDC said, samples showed amount virus infected people carried—or viral load—was similar vaccinated unvaccinated patients. CDC concluded latter vaccinated people become infected might spread Delta variant readily unvaccinated. 
 
The meaning viral load data disputed. Inside CDC, officials disagree agency’s conclusion vaccinated people become infected may spread virus readily unvaccinated, argue testing needs done, including tests measure infectious virus particles are, according person familiar matter.

“There’s one-to-one relationship high viral load infectivity, we’re always making decisions based imperfect data,” said Tom Frieden, headed CDC 2009 2017. 
 
Some scientists say Provincetown study isn’t reliable enough primary driver public health policy change. data recent independently reviewed outside experts, small sample circumstances outbreak unique applied parts country. 
 
The connection Provincetown data CDC’s new mask guidelines struck scientists obscure. guidance applied areas high transmission virus, tend parts U.S. lower vaccination rates. Vaccination rates Provincetown high, around 69% eligible Massachusetts residents.

“They’re making decisions basis extremely weak unreliable data, time necessary work reduce uncertainty among population,” said Vinay Prasad, physician professor Department Epidemiology Biostatistics University California, San Francisco. “When isn’t lot study data, CDC conducting studies.” 
 
CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund didn’t return messages seeking comment alleged weaknesses data. 
 
The CDC’s challenge extends beyond Covid-19 crisis. agency often relies samples determine extent disease outbreaks vaccination levels, public-health experts say ability collect comprehensive data real-time lacking.

Another point consternation scientists tracking so-called breakthrough Covid-19 infections among people vaccinated. 
 
The CDC said infections common Delta previous variants, agency stopped tracking mild moderate breakthrough infections didn’t lead hospitalization death April, Delta emerged driver pandemic U.S. 
 
Without additional breakthrough data, scientists struggled understand Delta behaves compared earlier iterations virus, said Daniel Kuritzkes, chief division infectious diseases Brigham Women’s Hospital Boston. 
 
“It leaves unmeasured extent infection extent transmission among vaccinated people,” said. 
 
The Kaiser Family Foundation last week estimated 74,713 breakthrough cases since January 25 states still track cases report publicly them. internal CDC slide presentation last week estimated 35,000 symptomatic breakthrough infections could happening week. 
 
The CDC stopped tracking mild breakthrough cases labor intensive data states counties wasn’t reliable, said federal official briefed matter. Local officials since increased efforts collect data, official said. 
 
The official said CDC reviewing data recent outbreaks. studies together informed conclusion 35,000 symptomatic breakthrough infections could happening week, person said. 
 
Some public-health experts said confusing ambiguous statements officials including Dr. Walensky compounded challenge posed CDC’s incomplete data. 
 
Dr. Walensky said congressional hearing May vaccinated people 5% chance contracting symptomatic Covid-19 exposed positive case. Vaccine experts said shots reduce chance symptomatic disease Covid-19 infection exposure positive case much lower 5%.

Last week, Dr. Walensky said television interview 20 vaccinated people aren’t wearing masks interact someone infectious, “one two them” could get symptomatic breakthrough infection transmit family members. 
 
The CDC slide presentation last week described incidence rate symptomatic breakthrough infections 21.4 cases per 100,000 vaccinated people, 0.02%, similar implied Kaiser Family Foundation study. 
 
“Not providing data transparently honestly eroding public trust,” said Tracy Høeg, physician epidemiologist teaches University California, Davis. 
 
The CDC didn’t respond requests comment criticism. 
 
The CDC also published puzzling data. According agency’s website, 197,845 children 12 received least one shot. Vaccines aren’t authorized U.S. children young. Vaccine makers evaluating whether shots safe children clinical trials. 
 
A CDC spokeswoman said tally could include children participating clinical trials. CDC also said birthdays could entered databases incorrectly. Moderna Inc. Pfizer Inc. partner BioNTech SE conducting clinical trials aiming enroll 11,000 total children U.S. 
 
Pfizer isn’t aware vaccinations outside trial children 12, spokeswoman said. 
 
Cody Meissner, chief pediatric infectious diseases division Tufts University School Medicine Boston, said seemed unlikely large number record-keeping glitch. “I don’t think say 200,000 birthdays entered incorrectly,” said. yeah minority gerrymandering vaccine pool variant mutations keep 'murica great. Kinda like riots protests last summer huh? said mask mandate school may stop vaccination rate sufficiently high states PREVENTING mask mandate states lowest vaccination rates. :(  **Again... That's false narrative last guy** repeats lies people believe them.

Digital: Passport app phones shows QR code scanned app bouncer's phone shows thumbs thumbs down.  70% total population fully vaccinated OG SARS-COV-2 goal. anywhere near that, like 50% total population fully vaccinated.

I guess still useful metric use predict cases. Ny still peak late March seen countrywide. one day, weeks. one makes big deal March spike. Spikes covered lot 'bad' states, that's point.

Once Delta gets grip, rapidly accelerate even lot first doses done. Nice pic No, I’m willing wear mask public long needed get vaccinated covid along yearly flu, boosters MMR, Tdap, tetanus things . also avoid close packed crowds, anyway.

I lots things daily habits protecting health fit social guidelines. I’ve spend decades wearing shoes bra variety mildly uncomfortable clothing public - adding mask hardship. good thing herd stupidity leads thinning herd, newly thinned herd automatically much closer herd immunity!

The really enforceable things like bans large gatherings seating limitations restaurants lot heavy lifting last year, mention people wearing masks due social pressure aren’t now.

I think Fauci warning “Two Americas” couple months back. would say wrong split *caused* vaccination rate, say vaccination rate latest reflection divide already exists.

What I’m curious “post-fact” America realizes pretending live reality bad thing, double down. it’s latter, I’m sure country makes decade. far…So good…So what. (Second album).

Peace Sells game you? One important thing article mentions, 14 cases caused 150 students staff qaurintine. include people home qaurintine too.

In state, student Teacher tests positive, wearing mask, people exposed qaurintine wearing mask. exception would unmasked, fully vaccinated people exposed would qaurintine symptoms.

I'm questions!  Yeah, least Greece people wear masks. Even outside Athens 50/50. Also, knowing enough app, trust fully yet, data security wise.

+1. Excelsior Pass uses State's vaccination data, data state already has. likely minimal added risk personal data, besides risk comes state data (which regardless use Excelsior App not).

If understand correctly, giving app access data NYC gov already have, added data security risk.

I probably missing something, literally taking photo vaccine card proof vaccine photo phone work well gaining entry places, see good reason use app all, even people vaccinated state. adding data security risk seemingly zero benefit user. consequential medical decision

I'm sure understand vaccination is. Forcing others makes sense, unless vaccines dont really work advertised.

When vaccine reduces infections e.g. 90%, tenth infections would without vaccine still happen. Simple math. delta variant, numbers bit worse.

*Killing Business … Business Good* Well that’s cool 60000 expect November. Good.  went RL Miami last week normal “festival sickness” days after. Fully vaxxed fecal matter seeped brain. 
She Covid (yet) immunity.
1/ bearing health get Covid her.
2/ won’t get vaccinated required wear mask work. I’m forcing get vaccinated. Duuuuh think much disagreement seeing. drug companies saying exactly Israel saying. UK coming less waning also start giving second doses population long Israel did. dont want NYC. agree more.  I'm anti vax. I'm taking vaccine researched long term effects I'm group great risk dying. vaccinated still spread covid thing vaccine greatly reduce chance dying covid. point invalid. current vaccine good reducing spread. stay home. Wear masks public avoid crowds get tested whole fucking lot. think I'm part. literally get vaxxed free subway, zero ID money needed, return get piece paper.

If made voter ID easy, wouldnt problem Great thing long able easily enforced &amp; proof flimsy white card. explains we're seeing minor breakthrough cases Delta variant, hopefully higher vaccination rates (like we're seeing Scotland) balance issue out. time singing produces lot pathogen spread passively watching sporting event. Though agree full capacity anything time soon stupid. Source work state university Florida. R1 that...that even Covid research always news trying get public listen. Yet, got email last week saying ""everything back normal. 2019 operating procedures"". shit show. frustrating. Yea, [spin wheel young sacrificed given disease hardly touches - least compared old. I'm sick hearing puritanical handwringing fact life returning normal. think lot people instinctively disapproved festivals clubs this, never means sublimated disapproval. Dang, starting excited too. Well still good news though. Hopefully Pfizer Moderna gets full approval soon.  There’s app specifically NY. It’s since beginning year believe. provide QR app business scan check ID. Test results provided app well. Hopefully national app comes out. curiosity Mexican media speculate way gatherings country? Yes oldest Millennials 40, youngest 20 enjoy modern society essentially say goodbye liberty, privacy accept rule government betrayed people many times virus likely manufactured lab? logic disgusts me. Lol especially come comments don’t even see event fun talking wouldn’t even go COVID. Like alright cool different interests Well, excuse: incompetence. 

They weren’t expecting red tape logistical inconsistencies many nations have. thought nations would bypass everything get vaccines, especially poor ones choice. wrong. Dunno help, written democrats scary think   vaccinated people so… Sorry, missed that! Toronto Canada?

Is Montreal Canada?  amount people medical conditions excludes covid-19 vaccines EXTREMELY small. still havent got smell back covid December, didnt even bad case it. went one yesterday Bay Area- I’ll honest, you’re really Covid conscious it’s great environment. I’d say 25% masks entire time, 50% extended period eat drink- despite mask mandate. risk equal club bear week Provincetown? No, all, I’d say it’s risky grocery store.  far saw, NYC requiring proof gyms indoor dining. activities requirements people, can't see infringes anyone's choice. still choose get vaccine. cannot choose activities high risk infecting people. Choices consequences. quit making feel like equal contributor. last couple days almost media creating ""your vaccine may dogsh*t"" narrative unhelpful larger scheme. Mask mandates coming back they're scaring us thinking vaccine enough because, OMG vaccinated people get Delta/Lambda, etc. Maybe, damn, make catchy dangerous year ago vaccinated folks. It’s impossible ballpark idea general risk - know you’re inside unmasked restaurants not, whether go office, etc. isn’t “what got sneezed on” much “whatever you’re doing, assume whatever current risk reduced proportion”.  I’m saying general answering “what chances getting it” vaccine otherwise hard specifics it’s dependent actions, rates you, probably body etc. fault, still catch spread Covid. thanks. also, basically restrictions. think many people thought people would trusted relationship doctor see somewhat regular basis. people know see doctor regularly chronic conditions babies children working vaccine schedule. young middle aged people know even primary care doctor.  Hubris point Denmark they’re sensible, think little quicker enact measures, slower virus arrive. wasn’t hotspot. like media focuses singular large event like this, completely miss similar gatherings similar magnitude happen Vegas almost everyday. 

At point, Covid infecting animals possibly mutating shit, never going see MASSIVE sweep deaths. point though, it’ll late. say Toronto metro areas Canada? Toronto Canada? 2 weeks ago Montreal telling people avoid 2 hospitals capacity due Covid cases. think person replied agrees. COVID isn’t going go away, best moving forward. Getting vaccinated best way prevent spread COVID, you’re worried large events leading spreading, get vaccinated. Simple that. much delta. unfortunately, original virus really exist more. overwhelmingly delta across world. It’s worked I’m surprised much BIden administration wasn’t prepared bribes red tape encounter. 

But it’s better inept administration wants right thing rather evil administration. Let’s see works restaurant empty tables night unvaccinated group walks in.. didn’t know *exclusive* indoor dining fitness. thought included things grocery stores well. 

There need hostile someone admits wrong. bad man.  Freedom isn’t protected constitution.

Voting [constitutional activity basis democracy all. 

Drivers license [costs vary course, non-driver IDs, sometimes less expensive, also [there time cost ID.  don’t right particular job. Want talk election fraud? It’s large 74.2 million number is. 44 million americans poverty would disagree  know much time/ effort many us put addressing, say, climate change.  invested lot energy climate change organization specifically focused reaching political conservatives. 

We made progress people gutting democracy, blocking action climate change, hard-core vaccine holdouts. look article. breaks type data looked various conclusions made. 
I think looking vaccinated people group seeing rate contracted virus valid, even going back January. group started small grew, comparing non-vaccinated people. want compare rate unvaccinated people that's hard people chance get whole pandemic, based published efficacy vaccinated rate 5%-20% unvaccinated. 1% vaccinated infected expect maybe 5% unvaccinated (pretty close guess). 
I think unfair look total vaccinated cases/hospitalizations/deaths compared unvaccinated *for whole year* reasons said. start year vaccine slowly getting rolled *of course* given case unvaccinated person. 
It's June/July good sorts comparisons, they're still pretty stark. easiest stats make sense fraction *currently* hospitalized people without vaccine, hugely slanted towards non-vaccinated. Illinois residents allowed go Lollapalooza? 100 million people US haven’t gotten vaccinated yet.


The pervasive availability vaccine fact it’s available form since Feb-March, generally available pretty much everywhere US since late May - extent we’re shipping “extra” doses abroad large volume means 100M either lazy get it, actively opposed getting it.

This pandemic deeply intensified misanthropic tendencies.  vaccine completely free Government spending billions outreach.

They could theoretically voting maintain ID requirement trying erase well studied inequality impact ID requirements. seems like colossal waste money since also well documented voter fraud exceedingly rare.

If anti-vaxxers rare voter fraud, would licked virus butt now. problem. see Ben Waianae tweet, news stories around misleading.

This partly follow quite public health experts Twitter recommend others same! Us: “I rats,, need call exterminator.”
Them: “But also cockroaches—why bothering rats?”

Also: 
Us: “I cockroaches, need call exterminator.”
Them: “You’ll never eliminate all! bothering calling exterminator?” show ID time pick tickets call, use county facilities (need verify residency), banks, getting sudafed, etc. Private business goverment time. That's awesome. I'm TN I'd sooner expect legislators assist forging documents provide proof legitimacy hope become widespread. went grocery store yesterday *maybe* three people wearing masks.

“Dear Members Yale Community,
Over past week received many questions regarding COVID-19 vaccination documentation—why, whether, students, trainees, faculty, staff submit information university. week’s message, attempt answer questions clarify vaccination submission/confirmation process.
Why submit confirm vaccination documentation?
Having accurate information level vaccination campus community allows university plan summer fall activities. sooner get information status vaccinations campus, sooner may able continue relax restrictions, pertain physical distancing, gatherings, campus visitors.
Additionally, students, trainees, faculty, staff required vaccinated approved exemption August 1, or, case students, start fall semester. completed vaccination (received second dose two-dose series one dose single-dose vaccine), submitting documentation Yale Vaccine Portal (the portal) confirm compliance requirement. 
I believe university already vaccination documentation—why confirm?
The simple answer even see vaccination information MyChart and/or received vaccination Yale location, assume vaccination information available university. Rather, go portal confirm (see instructions). 
Why that?
The university collecting COVID-19 vaccination information administrative purposes secure COVID-19 Health Safety Database (the database). order protect health information, university access medical record purpose unless grant explicit permission. Information individuals provide permission scheduling Yale COVID-19 Vaccine Program sent database. However, cases, way university collect information submitted portal. every case, best confirm.” makers superbowl surge Texas reopening-too-early surge, have... Lollapalooza surge!!! lmao media man know used state visitors? Worried won’t able prove vaccine status since got doses Canada Ontario health receipt! Definitely, without doubt. likely suburban people coming in. complicated. Delta variant poses additional challenges. vaccines showed slight efficacy drop Beta variant trials. Gamma slightly challenging, vaccines still provide great protection. Beta grand concern, spread significantly outside South Africa. vaccines trials tested severe symptoms/hospitalizations. released real world data showed stopped transmission. However, pre-Delta; transmission seems possible, low rate. Delta complicates containment strategies, seeing hospital provide confidence vaccine protect worst-case scenario. slow spreading variant precautions may fine. variant like delta precautions even 70%-80% enough populated areas. Maybe could vaccinated people truly randomly distributed usually get clusters virus gets unvaccinated cluster suddenly get spike hospitalizations time.

In Seattle area ICU beds full non covid emergencies due summer activities. added covid cases adds top pressure. actual numbers? percentages. course people covid vaccinated Restaurants bars state law. Glad help! look at, ""Figure 4. Symptomatic asymptomatic partially vaccinated breakthrough confirmed cases COVID-19 mutation interest (MOI) variant concern (VOC) symptom onset date*: Ontario, December 14, 2020 July 10, 2021""  Also we’re glossing 74.2 million votes like that’s small amount. ready 4th,5th,10th wave Nobody age 12 get vaccine gotten in. consider requiring masks, ventilation distancing schools restrictions? see lifted yet. 60-70 percent always hear herd immunity anyone know study takes account bear week?????? People exchanging fluids such… Indeed. tired catering crowd want recognize negative externalities choices pandemic. wanting vaccine passports long while.  seems like weird planned bad press Lollapalooza, there's load festivals tours going right now, likely less stringent Lollapalooza was. mention nightclubs bars many places back open. shows insulated people allowing news tells them: Look, Lollapalooza!!! mention, lean talk kid; teachers. downvoted soon able work full time support myself? right mind went begin with??  Better late never agree going don’t really basing science, anecdotes. loud group people meltdown ""muh freedoms muh rights"" even suggest sort proof vaccination.

Nevermind carry proof identity, license operate vehicle, cell phone mobile tracking device. rise variants random process. people around increase decrease chance _outside increasing number chances virus mutate transmission_ think Chicagoans hate Lollapalooza almost much St. Patrick's Day. Oh okay, well that’s bit different then, didn’t know that. Sturgis again. agree forgeries, states need vaccine passport app like NYC does. checking app _everywhere_. thought people would actually smart. think we're yet object policy prioritize vaccinated COVID patients trauma cases ahead unvaccinated COVID patients. There's reason someone heart attack die unvaccinated COVID patients taking beds. Fuck that. Let get fresh air. people attended Lolla fully vaccinated, choosing shame young people enjoying life year half robbed them, go find different outrage porn. 

And you’re still afraid COVID, GO GET FUCKING VACCINATED!!!!!! Oh look it’s younger people shocker forgot 2/3rds Indian adults vaccinated point, oh wait Could bring eh? inevitably bring? Two months ago completely different story. 50 million Brazil recieving first doses many days phenomenal. 

Not everyone speed latest data around world, see OP made mistake. Personally, think bit defensive - understand why. die it, might even hospitalized catch it.

This understatement less 0.004% fully vaccinated people breakthrough case led hospitalization less 0.001% fully vaccinated people died breakthrough Covid-19 case.

This ""dumb Americans get it"" story. masked year. joined clinical trial. I'm still getting tested events like travel concerts. I'm still working home. 

I comfortable 1 25,000 chance breakthrough hospitalization myself, provided keep getting tested I'm increasing risk infecting others. There's balance found. Good sauce lol

But makes sense. look death rate vaccinated group, course, older people. Old people mount robust immune response younger people, often underlying conditions aggravate disease.

Although assume mix groups might deaths unvaccinated group. false. requirement grocery stores essential services.  


Things like gyms, indoor dining, entertainment required life. 1984 action here^ One moments go... Fucking duh?

Who's surprised? one 16 months shit people still can't seem understand basics 

We really living simulation dumbest 30% population kill small intelligent % population. No, think it’s prudent minimize spread way possible know unvaccinated crowd aren’t going voluntarily wear one minimize spread. ~16,000 July 3rd 50,000+ one month later. 

The latest thinking Pfizer people got January February waning effects. 

We 130,000 confirmed cases testing 1/3rd rate back last peak. 

We lot basic information saying American's 4th wave may well surpass 3rd. 

Why country people acting like it? Forget Vax/Unvaxed one comment chain could and--

Why America acting like what's happening happening? business overwhelm hospitals affects everyone. Stop pretending 0 consequences. Completely understand excellent point kids. care people, don’t see point forcing masking majority people, minority people really need masked. No, invite willingly unvaccinated people gatherings. high school graduation party June 27 nearly 70 people. 12 vaccinated nobody got sick. kids 12 vaccinated parents generally interact unvaccinated adults. Thank you, others would responsible like I'm gathering article vaccinated people likely spread vaccinated people well would seem like every day publix outings, like shopping grocery store, instance, prolonged close contact indoors enough cause infection spread. guess means maybe hold large gatherings indoors general time being? Get Johnson Johnson vaccine different protests last year? 🤔 24,000 sounds like lot, add denominator. fun, let's assume 10 times long covid breakthroughs. 240,000 150 million vaccinated. would 0.16%. know determined put forth narrative vaccines amazingly effective, kind talk discourage vaccinations cost lives.  denied access healthcare infrastructure That’s call idiot. denied entry medical condition prohibits getting covd vax, suspect hard time finding lawyer take case...  Hashtag first world problems  fitness center I’d assume they’d keep record show first time shouldn’t bad restaurants could see stressing heck workers people neglecting show proof constantly ask it. top ten blackest states lower vaccine rates except dc, Maryland, Virginia Chicago shit vaccination rate comparison peer cities. Except weren’t vaccinated… aren’t people NYC refuse get vaccine. AOC’s district worse parts conservative Long Island. think varying data confuses people there’s already mistrust media. odd though red leaders stating publicly vaccinated. I'd interested see changes numbers coming weeks first shot recipients. True. we’ve unusually mild summer Texas. wonder else accounting difference.  100%. ICUs always lose money insanely expensive. 🙌🙌🙌 Fair efficacy point really is, stop going FESTIVALS. Stick bars parks friends. Lets get outside minimize risk 2020 even question. Health departments required vaccination sorts things nobody objected it. exactly. actually good thing means working lmao majority us *have* already come nightmare. Remember *literally anything* last year, 100,000-person live music fest year? 

Or honestly see difference?  outside. think we've seen sorts events super spreader disasters first envisioned would be. course people get sick concert I'd much concerned movie theater bar. force attendees mask   04/18/21: Delta started spreading here. Thanks solid advice :) Yeah, little guys pretty vulnerable now. Glad caught :) funny thing Covid hospitalizations aren’t really profitable. Elective surgeries bread butter lot hospitals stop they’re close capacity Sounds good. unvaccinated second class citizens get enjoy modern public space stop paying taxes. Cant taxed things allowed use anymore. DeSantis back bullshit today. Shocking.  letter may covid. Nah, Windows always virus-friendly. Many states already banned Covid passports.
Alabama ,Alaska , Arizona , Arkansas , Florida ,Idaho , Indiana ,Kansas ,Minnesota,Missouri, Montana , North Dakota, Oklahoma , South Carolina, South Dakota , Texas ,Utah , Wyoming many others also opposite it. 

NYC enforcing except paper. Chinese Government total absolute control population. Earlier pandemic welding people's door shut living neighborhood someone infected. [People starved death citywide tests nothing kidnap man's entire family making joke local party leader's receding hairline.

This normal Tuesday CCP. something celebrate. ""medicine,"" case complete totalitarianism, far, far worse disease.

_______________

My original comment removed sources added. Reposting here. true, majority people attending Lollapalooza. whatever reason younger people aren’t getting vaccinated much, group going extremely risk. 5% people went Utrecht music festival Netherlands got covid. talking festival magnitudes smaller Lolla, much less densely packed. 5% Lolla goers get covid, that’s 5000 cases covid directly lolla, thousands get initial goers. Doi transmit vaccinated people well also causing mutations.

I unable get vaccine natural immunity thru antibodies infected earlier year. fair me! ""could""   Jesus. events many people fucks sakes. Humans deserve this. It’s insane proposition. rapid antigen test stripes 10-20 viruses. Yesterday, PCR done close exposure symptoms. rhinovirus infection, raises interferon levels prevents coronavirus replication. see reason lateral flow assays couldn’t converted multi-antigen test. hope 2031 soon enough tbh Cool 10k people here

There many attendees still 2 THOUSAND people getting spreading it.

This efficacy works. base infection rate close 100%, even everyone admit don’t want part.

My part staying home protect others *who could protect themselves*, getting vaccinated.

My part also continuously advocating vaccine passports vaccine mandates, would actually solve problem.

Be mad people willingly unvaccinated. think owe anything, agree. I’m amazed people okay fact someone tell do. Might well set jump base Manhattan bridge. Get vaccine here. It’s 135 feet water. live live, not. Well thanks getting vaccine us. Let line 🐑🐑 crazy. Las Vegas, mask required indoors. However go pool club outdoor concert mask. hosted Gold Cup Final. 61,000 people attended city currently looking volunteers Life Beautiful concert. That's right they're looking employees they're looking volunteers. expecting 170,000 people three day concert. Pretty much am. I'll AC Phish, I'm concerned getting sick. far spreading it, live alone avoid family know vulnerable. 0 concern spreading willing anti-vaxer. people bring take even slightest precautions vaccines, deserve nothing us right thing. I'm really concerned testing positive mild case still needing sit 10 days missing tour. 

The ""StAy HomE yEr ScArEd!"" crowd made pretty clear give two shits covid. care them. always tell Milford man Except that’s literally never happened covid need military enforcement. 

Well starters even mandate vaccine military yet reunion took place June, expert opinion time vaccines PREVENT infection high degree. Well know Delta protection much less. cases elderly, still hospitalized. family's reunion serve warning who're contemplating group gatherings seniors (showers, anniversaries, bar mitzvah's, weddings, naming ceremonies etc). raise good point. effective mask mandate going rely law enforcement actually enforce it. Villages sure got access vaccine quickly. 100% legal, morally wrong protect yourself? Definitely not. nah id rather rest go die instead. dont worry stepping dog shit walking work Interesting California repealed law made felony KNOWINGLY spread HIV person without knowledge. Funny California deemed crime anymore idea get someone sick flu symptoms means violating constitutional rights? Yeah ok. Getting sick part life. mention good luck ever proving exactly picked sickness world. Thats part life. get sick heal. hypochondriacs seriously lost plot. Quit watching rage bait MSM bad symptoms? would rather get mild case Covid vaccinated shut again. talk India billion mostly unvaccinated people. already happening Rolling Loud crowd.  Exactly third world crank variants next decade. Can’t wait debate go outside due Gama Epsilon variant 2.2 2027. It’s nightmare go outside also cherry picked like 8 states USA used examples needing vaccinate overtaxed health care systems. people, including myself, point. I'm fully vaccinated sacrificed good amount life following restrictions lockdown procedures. mental health can't take stuck inside anymore implore anyone vaccine continue living lives. I'll continue following mandates, I'm going go bars, parties, many social gatherings since know I'm protected. people want choose unprotected risk going hospital that's them.  miserable lost staff member still care enough bothered. Haha. 

Seems like it’s unpopular opinion though. See actual study CDC references reference #159 (middle page ""Breakthrough infections"").

in referenced article:

""Results:  outbreak  total  23 residents  four health care workers  tested positive  SARS-CoV-2. Four residents  unvaccinated, including one  severe course disease later deceased. Despite old age, vaccinated residents showed mild disease. Comparison humoral immune response revealed significantly higher antibody levels  fully vaccinated infected individuals compared  fully vaccinated uninfected individuals (p&lt;0.001). Notably, although minority vaccinated uninfected group showed neutralisation capacity  SARS-CoV-2,  vaccinated infected individuals showed high-titer neutralisation  SARS-CoV-2 including  alpha beta variant.

Discussion: Large SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks  occur  fully vaccinated populations, seem associate mild disease. SARS-CoV-2 infection fully vaccinated individuals strong booster humoral immune response providing enhanced neutralisation capacity immune evasion variants.""  crowd suddenly caring Fred Durst sign upcoming slaughter. you’re Allowed public gatherings airplanes etc Vaccine mandates happen lol. 

Never forget Boston mandated smallpox vaccine 270 PEOPLE DIED. also good note Republican party alienated everyone hardcore followers. 2 party system they're labeled Democrats, regardless agree DNC's platform not. give little insight statistics. say Age mean much Delta hospitalization tell don’t insurance 80% actually super easy, barely inconvenience.

For purposes math people catch disease count vaccinated catch it. someone works cruise ship right 100% vaccinated crew 92% vaccinated guests (lots kids onboard ineligible vaccines) ship 4+ cases amongst population 2,500 onboard makes national news, quite irritating airlines don’t get coverage part spread since passengers gone could even test positive.

How many commercial airlines test flight 5-10 CDC officials onboard verify proper procedures place enforced allowing paying customers on? Testing flights tracking cases arise result every single flight?

See also: live entertainment protocols UK. Large football stadium filled 50,000? Absolutely! Theatre West End? 1/2 1/4 capacity masks/distancing required. Especially since beginning Pandemic got vaccinated probably right thing entire time.

Then vaccine came way get things back normal bunch fucks decided to.

It's literally like getting recess taken away one kid never shuts fuck Well, it’s unvaccinated people assholes period.

I agreed CDC masks. Why? unvaccinated friends saying “why get vaccinated I’ll still wear mask?” CDC catered them, usual, saying “ok, get vaccinated won’t wear mask.”

Yea, doesn’t sound like smartest policy, it’s CDC’s fault people make new excuse time attempt made baby getting vaccinated. I’m forceful mandatory vaccination point. anti-American? Maybe. don’t see much America supposed anything unvaccinated done since start pandemic. iphone, notes app ""scanning"" feature access holding finger app icon second two. vaccine card ""scanned"" phone easily accessible anyone needs see way. AZ also that?

Vectored vaccines really good. infecting muscle cells spike-making genetic code, immune system gets see covid-infected cell really looks like. cellular (protective) immunity generated strong. They've got republican legislative majority, bet they'll shut anyways. Ya, it’s tough text …
Thanks response kind open question still.

Vaccines cure disease, they're like ""practice run"" train immune system, next time body sees disease, fight sooner/faster. seems logical, *probably* true means vaccinated people less likely covid vectors vaccinated people, much less likely? That's actively studied.

What completely established, like said, vaccinated individuals contract covid vastly reduced symptoms. People might died instead get nasty cold. People would hospitalized get moderate cold. People would gotten nasty cold get couple days sniffles. way way actually affects public health. I'm waiting videos come showing cell phone data tracing Lollapalooza participants spread throughout country. like Spring breakers last year Palm Beach Welcome Communism. weird Reuters would actually post it. without peer review best just...ignore Darwinism? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Bought tickets another rave lying bed Delta. I'm curious see disease truly like cold catch multiple times per year.

Whatever though. put mask suggested, followed rules, got vaxxed first chance. I'm done lol laugh 

You won’t one laughing you. think we've vaccinated people, based I've heard vaccination levels Southern US.

Because way we've rolled vaccines means vulnerable groups extremely high uptake, 90-95%. vast majority unvaccinated, responsible cases, teens 20s unlikely hospitalized. CDC reported 6,587 Covid-19 breakthrough cases July 26, including 6,239 hospitalizations 1,263 deaths. time, 163 million people United States fully vaccinated Covid-19.

There 1263 fully vaxxed deaths US 163 million. get 1/1000th chance kill would imply .07% vaccinated people exposed COVID. seems highly unlikely. 15 days flatten curve Friend tested positive festival vaccinated Good Absolutely. concerned getting hit car.

Had big party friend two weeks ago celebrating partners birthday weekend sit Reddit whine downvotes lol know life empty one tell feel better 🥺 people smart. hired smart. 

From beginning, everyone (smart) talking keeping track proof vaccination. 

Not sure pulled 20% from, suspect it’s ass, maybe fire anyone dumb enough lost something obviously important anyone foresight. Yup, home Stetson, home rich private university students whose parents believe masks, vaccines, even existence COVID-19. 

I've lived 49 years (save two year break Georgia), going downhill last 25. statistical analysis people went reported got covid. Compare data control groups check third variables. 

If people covid statistically significantly likely gone event people event statistically significantly likely hospitalized covid know.

I know method used common easy method use. many methods use let us know people likely infected. can’t carry something aren’t infected first place. Yes, two factors consider: 

1) Likely due seasonal factors (limited ""winter"", especially South Florida), much less peaky winter Georgia states. per capita basis, Florida peaked 35 active hospitalizations per 100K residents. comparison, Georgia peaked 55 active hospitalizations per 100K residents. Despite record highs, Florida still 40 active hospitalizations per 100K residents likely late-stage Delta growth curve. 

2) Florida higher vaccination rate, also much aged population. median age Florida 6 years older Georgia. impacts net total potential death hospitalization rate. *pats wall corpses*

this levee keep rising seas back YEARS! I’m going blame they’re literally blame. won’t hurt try again. But, originally tried signing it, tried actual appointment date (they also wrote wrong date card) tried personal zip code along Walgreens’ zip code. tried every combination, never got working. article preprint certified peer review That’s interesting point. look what’s happening New Zealand, you’ll find unintended consequence masking/isolating due COVID-19. restrictions ending, babies getting sick RSV infections, hospitals getting overwhelmed. Normally, sick babies don’t virus time. 

I get importance building immune system getting breakthrough Delta infections, wouldn’t want infect vulnerable people process. Vaccinated people spread virus, too, unfortunately. high percentage population vaccinated, might change equation me. wouldn’t want pass illness someone cancer, sick, kid, elderly person. booster shot Delta would also build immunity, I’ll wait since developed. Look ig mean virus pandemic end don’t think vaccinate kids Yeah, one benefits living driving distance los angeles. starting sound like app start grift lol. call I've said ridiculous personally haven;t heard it, I'm abrasive? ok cupcake. prob 2 months till full strength. (from first shot) got first setup second exactly month later easy remember. (and I'm sure easier organize them) 

You still need time second shot think studies show wait longer first second shot get stronger immunity.

So start today think 2 months now, full strength point.

Whis is, uh, lot like US fair all. like fair wear mask even vaccinated unvaccinated jackasses spiking case numbers. new information indicating possibility high mortality young? stops massive community spread? vaccinations! ""Associations specialty physicians serve immunocompromised patients also working guidance, patients may good candidates boosters future.""

This sounds casual, they're considering new recommendations fish oil supplements something. I'm glad they're working it, hope come answer someday. speed virus moves community speed great many organizations moving issue really different. many people guys know? hardly know anyone tested positive, let alone needing treatment worse.   Doesn’t change fact vaccinated spread virus.  Well, certainly spike elementary middle schools start semester. probably whole house burning down, fight toilet paper fashion masks clothes. shortages over, everyone tested contact. Saying vaccinated high risk little hyperbolic. Protection severe illness remains intact. facts feelings sorry cnbc says wrong

74% new cases Mass fully vaccinated, look up.

the vaccine nothing. last months focused getting people vaccinated lmao... last DAYS masks idiots still refusing vaccine are. Israel offering third Pfizer shots - essentially boosters— people 60 got shots five months ago. friend mine Chicago went Walgreens told needed second shot. wouldn’t give without prior vaccine card. went CVS asked first shot got it. And, actually third shot. may wait till meet five month mark thing. anecdotal evidence best. numbers back claim whatsoever. many kids? 1? 100? 30,000? Also “who eligible vaccine” part shows 12s can’t get vaccinated still low risk. issue enough people vaccinated, that's media pushing. CDC knew months ago reached herd immunity vaccinations yet, everyone's minds? Masks! Masks great way people talk them, think kind magic forcefield, much worse discourse around vaccines far. Yeah know. facetious... probably written that. really unhelpful response imo. Genuine curiosity totally understandable. definitely 90% anymore. supermarkets shops probably 60/40 masking / masking up. you’re willing give blowjob one people who’s damage American democracy, I’m fairly certain you’re shitty person regardless job title. remember people saying thing back ""15 days slow spread."" told insane daring suggest something crazy vaccine passports would become reality allowed harshest restrictions go unchallenged. everyone sub called crazy cheering making vague, unconscionable comparisons forced domestic commerce vaccine pass keeping children buying handles Tequila liquor store. vaccine mandates - also kept Japanese people internment camps separated people color water fountain. ""We before, fine"" strong argument. believe vaccine Trump family got shots secret, showing public all. appeared TV getting shots, saw family well, vaccine hesitancy would much, MUCH lower.

A people encountered actually believe needed got shot all, he, less, Chuck Norris'd covid-19 forever immune. vox? would rather read used toilet paper stupid race. county people go disguise vaccinated? That’s one way get numbers down. know what? family member still dead. based convention literally butt-fucking whole time. Yep LA 2000 breakthroughs week til last week, doubled 4000…. infinitesimal death rates 12 current moment? see point know people color disproportionately affected issues, think leaves county state mandate employers give people couple days per vaccine. 

Currently, far transportation, LA County come door vaccinate. Breakthrough case here. Received second phizer dose early June. Started showing symptoms past Thursday. Lost taste smell Sunday. Headache dry cough today. What’s comment supposed mean? Yes, vaccinated people lead less death. He’s worst governor state lifetime. understanding he’s doing. fucking air conditioner salesman. large portion American public ignores sources convey nuance. information people can’t read past headline. NC. district made masks optional. kids masked policy exposed unmasked positive case, they’ll quarantine anyway. It’s 2nd day school. already positive case. husband work. can’t afford quarantines. I’m mad district. Quality info super reported. someone smart ignore say - actually saying? There's idiocy lost translation, pretty sure I've got clear now. Nice see getting attention. saw footage gate, security waving anyone card, enforcement. 

Rolling Loud last weekend barely got attention 70K attending every day. Florida less.

Meanwhile Sturgis held mid-August news weeks cases actually [declined Duh got J&amp;J one. Going get Moderna booster next week. 

The J&amp;J one still *significantly* better nothing. It’s Pfizer Moderna significantly better J&amp;J. say - end? risk contracting disease low, risk spreading contracting even lower. thresholds making decisions?

When vaccines available all. 50+ million Americans (under 12's) still unable get vaccine. thought efficacy rate isn’t likelihood getting per exposure, it’s likelihood getting all. point still stands, though, exposure isn’t guarantee getting you’re one 5% potential breakthrough folks chances go you’re exposed. it’s much less severe, even though people still get it, rate death transmission much lower people get vaccinated - ideal solution? People wearing masks distancing Sturgis, bad. 

People wearing masks distancing music festivals. Bad. 

People wearing masks, avoid facial recognition, distancing protests. Good way covid spread I'm wondering too. Got 2 moderna want safe whatever fall spike happen. There's tons anti vaxxers California. want die br it, I'll take extra they're having. I'm thinking going JJ may give extra boost get another mrna vaccine actual number? believe around 90%. pretty sure illegal ::Spelling Bee::

Moderator: “That correct.” Florida within 10% NY California fully vaccinated. 

FL: 49%
CA: 53%
NY: 57%

Look what’s happening Florida. 2000 people hospital COVID prior peak, it’s still climbing. think it’s foolish believe situation isolated. Wonder many Floridians hospital due judgemental stuff. Right, someone's ""happiness"" kill child asthma someone's grandmother that's need rise together better selfish.

And even last year society shut down. People still functioned lesser level. *flatten curve* meaning stop hospitals overflowing, “two weeks over.” person suggested then-president. CDC states vaccinated still spread it.

Study link article want raw data. Shunning work. consider intelligent well informed, shunning ignorance showing.

Anti-vaxxing almost old vaccines themselves. likely concept remain end humanity, stupidity infinite resource possess. insensitive Exactly heathy, vaccinated people need wear fucking masks. don’t become public official?"
