0,2020-10-28,"  tier system advisors said TV enough get things control.

These tier 2 &amp; 3 towns/cities even close lockdowns, tier 3 pretty much everything still open still go pubs restaurants. They're über-wealthy elitists jobs lobbying defense contractors foreign governments lined leave office. every possible privilege denied American people totally insulated consequences legislative action. give shit us. barely locked first place. People NE cause to, afterwards much movement interaction.

It probably case case basis like El Paso. saying small country, size wise, easy lock down. 

US counties big therefore easy close, according logic. drive 4 Europeans countries minute. Congrats hell year, it. Yeah, good journalists use Facebook verifiable source accurate news. generic multivitamin, containing appropriate amounts vitamin magnesium, work well two different supplements? often see vitamin marketed independently said generic multivitamin. reason this? Recent studies revealed possible binding sites present SARS-CoV-2 studied interactions tea polyphenols. EGCG theaflavins, especially theaflavin-3,3′-digallate (TF3) shown significant interaction receptors consideration review. docking studies emphasize activity polyphenols COVID-19. Thanks everyone Victoria efforts!!!! We’re proud you! Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia cities similar stories. Unfortunately almost always fallen apart. 


This highly contagious virus, still general population, restrictions, right conditions hit, spread like wildfire even small number infections. businesses actively involved mitigation activities (i.e. manufacturing vaccines, supplying food, etc.) must cease desist operations notice risk permanent forced closure.

Well problem would first round lockdowns something like 80% businesses still deemed ""essential"", bolted everything ER rooms shut eventually would need package delivered logistics companies would open again, equipment tech needs copper wire electricity home depot/lowes opens again, cleaning crew need windex walmart open goes chain. It’s hard concept understand... mask save life! another point reference, 4 days would exceed Australia's case count too. long hand shake mine lot people I'm would rather get sick stop going restaurants, etc No, saying easier close national borders. US whole that; nothing individual US counties. drive 3 counties within 20 minutes. Trump sniffles. Everyone leaves home already couple dozen medical professionals (doctors nurses) airlifted actual hospital doctors nurses long weekend sniffles U.S. Right?


Hoaxvirus! Plandemic!


/$ Nailed it! None explains ""Latino"" needs headline. fact he's Latino makes difference story. pure ethnic pandering.  ...go hang Hawaii, Alaska come too. would look like Apparently guard tried grab one girls’ phone. Still doesn’t excuse assault, let alone stabbing poor guy repeatedly. wonder punishment attempted murder there? don't. get tested enter country posutives get isolated.

Iceland same, funny use test jam stick people's noses. airport option stick really. fact people stab others surprise. shock millions people think justified. 

We bad state, things wrong spiraling control. 

The poor guard trying protect others, that's all. Dai su 20 persone senza mascherina una stanza per 5 ore al giorno sono un rischio enorme. contagiati scuola sono sottostimati visto che funziona così: un paio di studenti hanno sintomi covid, li mandano casa e se sono positivi mettono quarantena la classe. Se ci sono 10 asintomatici non li contano nemmeno. E se infettano qualcuno casa anche quel caso quanto contatti non li controlla nessuno. Ciononostante la popolazione scolastica è infettata il doppio rispetto alla popolazione italiana. People also die starvation homeless freezing streets chicago...some potential problems unemployed. care small percentage old people could die covid, isn’t right? one else seems matter work pharmacy, see script time. Usually people picking *very* dark-skinned, always - sometimes moderately dark-skinned. Can't recall ever seeing someone white picking I'm sure exist so? hiring. Also would business one whose owner anti mask stuff. I'm sure is. mentioning *also* referenced Replacements

And case know, Replacements spoof footbal movie. *ALL WELL!!! EVERYBODY STAY CALM! TRUCK LOADS BODIES AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS! FIIINE!! PEOPLE GETTING UPSET??*  Imagine thinking need shoot someone soil attack another nation 2020. Steady now. Seems bit harsh Wtf wrong people says right stuff average state metrics one worst 2nd waves right now. Add teetering bankruptcy bad spot Well lucky us America. rounding corner. Nothing worry about! Every time fuck choose either overwhelmed hospitals ton people die lockdown.

It's weirs many countries keep putting themselved situation. Dude... 175 concurrent cases school get shut down. We’re far 14:100000 Maybe. However, seen around world. 

You clearly used public health care system Poland that's think. Here's random source: followed rules 7 months. family completely rejects quarantine now. Way fucking go gov Jeez, B!den terrible job! love this! three cases school last 24 hours. Half students home full time quarantine. lessons livestreamed can’t leave desk help students one-on-one. actually preferred full digital approach “kids need school”. CLUE goes certification education process teachers. mother taught 25+ years. 
I bit biased, damn good teacher.  Spent money pocket classroom. balance time child “children”.  ignorant unwilling listen resin twits like undermine every turn. 

School board members either well informed people ever meet. like guy, thinks teachers shoulder blame parents nit responsible anything. 

Was well connected rich chance?? Philippine government refused listen warnings scientists implement mass testing contact tracing. also made easier virus spread refusing punish government allies broke quarantine protocol well poorly thought counter-measures. /u/Gold_Morning entirely fair. [seems contradict dehumanization dissent continues Impossible, reddit phds told herd immunity right around corner!!! TEMPORARILY, course

forever also cool Moderna, Abbott, Pfizer want put vaccine that’s harmful work. Right. Facepalm Yes, utterly refused actually *enforce* afterward. Nobody's gonna lock again. tough prepper p@triots even hunker bunker weeks crying hair cuts Applebees! Americ@ns joke. say, people went super irresponsible well.

It's like stupid children think funny game covid restrictions, understand serious. said real Christians behave like that, goes tje grain Christianity lol. think so, State institutions rank file CDC go along. used run lab quality control drug manufacture, developed executed validation packages manufacture new drugs. threatened firing returning conclusions bosses wanted, staying data said sound analysis always pulled through. think many people working field experience resist pressure. *quebec entered chat*

Seriously, don’t understand. rules strict still insane amount cases. work hospital, it’s bad again. like first time, bad enough. 

I exhausted. work green zone, getting backlog patients didn’t go hospital last spring got much much sicker. less less health care workers patients. system acting war zone. said take responsibility 60 minutes  [Yes, measures mostly we're hellhole nanny state like suggested. expensive cigarettes alcohol, still financially accessible most. Otherwise taxes pretty normal western country good social services. Dude's talking like live North Korea. apartment building lockdown rightly controversial, over-the-top, least residents compensated financially. Obama’s Hispanic vote director 2008 campaign, political activist Miami, focused relations Cuba related Miami’s current mayor. big deal south Florida. Cause one election reality country.

Yawn. idiots hypocrites persuasions. nothing Christians personally. Priority 1 ""make easier vote""...

How scenery Itaewon, Seoul year's Halloween Day? quarantine authorities tense.

This coronavirus spread across country visitors Itaewon clubs holiday season early May.

On October 31st, every year Halloween Day, 100,000 people flock Itaewon.

**catchphraises:**

You may become real ghost trying enjoy Halloween Day.

This year may really scary festival wrong.

Come on... first time Corona Halloween?

I know October 31st.

**bottom left:**

To prevent spread COVID-19,

enjoy year's Halloween Day quietly even letting ghosts know!

The moment party starts, real horror may begin!

Only essential outings Halloween Day!

&amp;#x200B;

**bottom right:**

Instead noisy offline meetings parties,

go online non-face-to-face! premeditated? 
 
Are suggesting bringing knife store stabbing someone 27 times friend restrains something *just happens*? 
 
It’s clear day premeditated attack went specifically plan stab someone confronted wearing masks. Exactly. It’s easy applaud moves like don’t affect you, it’s extremely tone deaf. Meanwhile waiters waitresses worrying whether able feed kids pay rent. Sure won’t die Corona point you’re worried starvation...and yet still government aid seen county announced today get 100 cases day moving schools remote learning. 72 cases today. mean blm protesters? 

I guess dozens deaths, thousands injuries, billions dollars damage already told us though huh. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* look Massachusetts requires visitors.

It's fact declare one. North Korea let citizens leave country. That's international travel. Seems pretty authoritarian me.   text/message...? It'll set precedent rest Europe real. Service workers deal amount crazy everyone, crazy not, go store eventually. never know psycho gonna come walking door. China category. least spring also got feel cozy bake stuff well deal shit think I've explained properly. actually think SPH orders necessary West right order stave current set outbreaks. severe first time last longer 5-7 weeks however long takes get suppression system put place, longer 8-10 weeks most. Obviously, countries need offer financial support time--people rebelling Italy right government refuses offer financial support efficient lockdown can't work otherwise. 

After period, governments need everything possible avoid another lockdown means suppression system like ones SEA countries place. Asian countries successful governments pulling weight Western governments nothing blame citizens bureaucratic failures.

I'm lockdowns times crises like right now, I'm lockdowns glorified. People West see way get back ""normal"" thanks glorification NZ Australia, understand lockdowns successful. People governments need adjust expectations, otherwise continue disappointed. Man, seems like March April yesterday. People pissing daily stuff. 

“Doctors nurses deserve respect applause”

“Agreed. Wear mask help out.

“NO! not. know better do!” Water wet Yes, winter holidays. Stay home people live with. See grandma next year. I’m two minds this. 

Half looks everything say says “yep”. wrong all. 

The half wonders forceful early would accomplish. Would brought Scott Atlas closer Trump? countries start tightening border controls? easy drive Madrid Warsaw right now, going change soon? job doesn't. stay away even week might lose it. agenda, reason lie.

Why bothers people see life going sweden videos denmark?. everybody see farce going country rest world forced wear face masks?. mean knew asymptomatic/presymptomatic transmission? use routine classroom, basically. Multiple students tested positive haven’t yet. Oh wait I’m thinking vampires nvm um actually signed it... correct. 

It never allowed get bad long-term lockdowns option.  

So sense, barking wrong tree.  akin lecturing drunks died car accidents sober take bus. masks. Kind middle-ish I'd say - we're 86th world cases per capita, 38th deaths per capita. lot deaths early Quebec, unfortunately; almost half total deaths happened province June. 

Compared specific areas mentioned, I'm sure. always hard know metrics even mean testing reporting variable. 

Mexico slightly cases twice deaths, US three times per capita cases three times death rate. European countries, many got absolutely hammered early relative smaller populations almost need two sets per capita figures; one early epidemic one now. 

Personally speaking, I'm Atlantic region, far survived pretty well, friends family Ontario extremely different experience I've had. spikes showing everywhere else showing Canada well. hope - everyone else - weather well. thought virus came night? entitlement- I’m referring friendly hello smile. I’m referring random people tell hateful politics grocery line. creepy guy safeway following around entire store distance asking personal questions. people tell smile like mood something right to.

Im meaning sound dramatic. But, unfortunately, unsolicited interactions strangers really pleasant. often times uncomfortable violating. 

It probably sounds topic, thought might like hear different perspective. original statement several comments back sounded definitive- it’s hinderance. 

But get experience different feel extraverts there. Thanks wearing mask anyways. lot people don’t. F either die virus recover 100% damage health. literally two outcomes. That's one original thoughts thread. discuss it? That's link article talks announcement, actual announcement white house. link? Oh look, map remind off? Look familiar anyone?

Would rather get specific less post gets deleted bot. George W corrupt incompetent. would ""best President"" anything. 9/11, anthrax, Katrina, Global Financial Crisis. Worst President ever - Trump. first thought. Especially since Sweden Denmark likely similar neighbours. Lol... oh optimist you! Good. sounds much fair, person people voted would win. Core proposed strategy closures re-introducing mandatory contact prohobitions spring enforce again, done spring. good thing much beds enough workers take care hard cases ICUs. virus attack brain organs. even mild case die couple weeks later organic failure... father friend bad case. learn speak walk again. lost lot memories. die. like said catch really bad long-termn damage without hospital First ironic reply idea, Sweden “best world counting”.

Secondly, Denmark less excess mortality accounted Sweden.

Denmark started counting every death Covid 60 days back, changed 30 days criteria widely used EU. think changed beginning May.

I found 12 deaths removed 30 days criteria could more.

Lag reporting never really issue Denmark like Sweden. think two reasons: reports Covid found post mortem, also Denmark started days without reported deaths already middle May.

I'm expert, understand that, Sweden's regional health authorities less integrated national authorities Denmark regards reporting deaths current number patients hospitalised. Probably since trump thinks get would Germany. Fuck Steve matter, least number 1!!!!!!!!! Sounds like potion fantasy game stops death. Fill holy water sur-vial. lo-fi Smash Mouth played mono speaker background. ICU beds magic pills though. I'm you. really wish way say ""you're still trials, give anyway."" I'd willing take risk. think number cases relevant. Surely number deaths arising important number - although even suspect. jurisdiction, tested positive Covid 19 die car crash, counted Covid death.

100% cases amongst family friends non-fatal, everyone affected (including me) back full health. Task Manager stopped responding less SAP disappointing performance tanked 20% , impacted DAX whole lockdown announcement Japan Korea still seeing hundreds cases every day, compared Asian countries I’d hardly say it’s “fine”. like carefully include Denmark first graphs. going put reminder far world read months ago, air zones planes zones filtered recirculated.

MmpI disagree politics see side enemy. US right wing literally accept foreign nations' support subjugating fellow Americans. Oh right, forgive thinking vaccines made different companies, targeted different ailments complex interactions. Obviously tell get flu vaccine (which hit miss years anyway) ... must HATE VACCINES.

What's logical reason getting flu vaccine year everyone social distancing flu cases low CDC even bothering collect data it?

Sorry triggers much promoted healthy living way combat sniffles. years controversy world, guess everyone uses one operating system, speaks one language cooks meat degree wellness.... like there's room one system medicine / health sheep? anything gotten yet? weather gets colder, really needs happen national scale. Outdoor seating option freezing, restaurants revert back indooor seating. That's recipe disaster. Meanwhile Malaysia...  prepared might prevent infection rather reduce symptoms, and, even then, might work everyone long

Source: article see, much monitor restrictions. now, able ensure basics summer time.

The thing achieve cutting possible infections environments like bars / restaurants rest fluff. maybe cut 1/4, go current (page 12 graphic). yellow brackets ""cut down"", ones remain. blue brackets (living places) can't avoid infection always comes first outside living place person / yourself. think point diet rich simple carbohydrates likely make overeat.

In foods evolved eat, sugars usually combined slowly digested even indigestible (fiber) carbohydrates. Except occasional raid beehive, ancestors access concentrated sugar.

Fat even energy dense sugar also makes feel full. Unless combine carbohydrates certain ratio (e.g. potato chips). Another thing keeps hungry alcohol.

Instead emphasis placed counter treatments means preventing worst Covid symptoms taking place. retrospective study came saying 80% people hospital Covid deficient Vitamin message needs get mainstream public. Instead trying hide, go take ton Vitamin Zinc. give people chance something positive change reducing likelihood ever go hospital catch Covid. Since summer, workers given financial incentives eat restaurants government *wants*.

So nuts, least level general public. government behaving way another matter. suspect whole reason people forced physically go office prop restaurants. That's false equivalency ever saw one.

I'm proud! heard well nurse, number positive cases also affects hospital operates losing money overall. make huge chunk money elective surgeries since negotiate insurance company government.

It's simple report cases, get money. Additionally, report many cases would assume would need paperwork tests back up. could faked, administrative person checking box. sure stopped testing. must know pandemic soon hit 0 daily tests. sad thing is, virus scary enough people. make puke blood something, symptoms similar respiratory track diseases, maybe people took seriously. 'it's flu"". also weeks covid deaths summer without lockdown. no, good example. really appreciate here. never cross word! 💐 Much love, country owes guys Dan Andrews major debt. Localized easier subdue, then. Like New Zealand , among others, managed do. Thank Honestly, even makes explosions cases scary, since eventually guidelines social distancing fall ""well, tried social distancing, move bodies streets back months. Give up, everyone lick doorknobs, let's make everyone get it, get sick, done it- three months time antibodies end, shit again."" believe actually time. deadline something like October 12th 17th?

I'd still encourage everyone try! wants achieve herd immunity. 

Whether that’s possible? don’t know easily virus mutate, don’t know that, either. 

In meantime, what’s couple million dead Americans, couples 40% survivors dealing one manifestations long hauler syndrome, right? topic thread considered medical advice? can't help contradict ~~logic~~ flawed. fake released China? Like say kind contradictory shit time. MAskS wOrK virus fake. idiots?

(Not raging anyone general denier morons) simple, similar things. recommending gargling general oral health, like many employ daily hygiene routine. recommend specific ones studied specifically respiratory infections, act gargling beneficial throat that's basically they're saying here. Hero. Role model. Good Teammate. Responsible adult. None above. Alas, 99.9% Americans experiencing something completely different, even far combination integrity awareness concede deeply dystopian reality.

Ah, admit don’t votes democratically elect boy no, shouldn’t unnecessary traveling time like this. Dear Leader cured defeated virus! I'm imagining New York states huge New Year's attractions probably ""socially distanced"" ball drops. Whatever means, lol. reason invoke (less density populated areas wouldn’t say) sound current system isn’t better. Today states decide election entire country. better? country consistently voter turnout 50%, undeniably issue.

You could still system based electoral college would representative population giving power smaller states. remove actual electors keep weight based system time proportional system, everybody would incentive vote smaller states wouldn’t crushed bigger one.

Plus big state like California, end 51/49 result, wouldn’t get 55 electors way representative people think state. Apparently cannot tell facts current state welfare US considered political. tldr: maybe short term. fair ask that. government refuses make easier folks do. See recessed senate instead forcing economic relief bill pandemic surges. take abject failure government proof government effective.

Also, everyone wants watch parents die horrible drowning death week ventilator, matter old are. No, government help times like keep you, family everyone else safe. may interested [this adapted from[JAMA May 

Depending class antibody (IgG lasts longer, IgM shorter) decreasing slope. Yeah guys great! 70-80,000 new cases day less 250,000 dead far! much better 35,000 deaths France! Flatten curve take several years lockdown, governments switched containment restrictions. people switched back flatten curve lockdowns come ""few restrictions"" unconstitutional ""freedom"". Yep, need another lockdo- oh wait we're ran idiots. That’s absurd. Old obese lock choose. way I’m locking weeks grandma can’t bring isolate bit We've issue fractal frog... delete bunch posts someone reported them. read them. did, earth would delete discussion merits taking flu jab season.

- contradictory science whether helps not
- yet proven link flu vaccine severity covid infection
- there's wider discussion efficacy seasonal flu vaccine

please, dear overlord tell low information discussing something relevant vaccine people deliberating getting? posted links studies not? *did* choice tho. It’s choice involved hundreds thousands deaths.  Fair, I’ll follow days see looks. new study. would probably considered offering medical advice, violates one rules subreddit. People interested talking supplements ameliorating covid-19 symptoms might better served supplements subreddit. friend said wear Trump 2020 masks virus would go away fast would make heads spin. cannot believe people dumb. people still believing hoax called Covid? live Ohio cut hair living. blows mind. fight people everyday wearing mask. Crazy standing one foot them. Also feel like open. shitty position in. Cant afford work...also feel like contributing problem. get tons elderly people in. dont know shut us large part thinks would right thing do. Surprised? Nope 
Hotel? Trivago Sweden eighth German population, quarter infections half casualties. reason Sweden quite well beginning lot things without anyone telling forcing them, changed lockdown real possibilty too. Sweden also much lower population density three direct neighbors instead nine.

The initial lockdown Germany largely lifted couple weeks. large gatherings still banned. people live returned relative normal, Home Office, masks needed, events large audiences.

Considering many Americans view harmless piece cloth personal attack freedom, US advanced social system provide people amd small businesses lockdown, neither German Swedish model never option US. many countries, sun light powerful enough produce vitamin half year stock lot summer wondering trick treating. Ia something movies still done? We're rounding curve, Anything negative China gets downvoted oblivion sure q is. mention couple specific ones suggesting gargling like would perform oral health general, whatever regularly use provide benefit referred (ie water w salt, Listerine, etc...) Personal opinion aside, minor make health decisions themselves? Well, right one thing. doubled, fact tripled since posted lol It’s pandemic everyone gets it, right? yet Florida governor hasn’t took back threat schools reopen stay open. Pretty sure liberal media Mmm no. That’s neighbors. Anyways sounds like missing point. order magnitude almost Europe. Tegnell expected lower. Even basically taunted them. wrong lower starting later. reason is, basically isolated summer isolating even going small country houses. roughly 12 days behind Austria numbers gives time react. look miracle none. Yeah, think 2 weeks initial infections, infected person probably infects least 2 others. add another 2 weeks least double original infection count. 

That's real issue. idiots get infected go home infect others may idiots. people could asymptomatic spreading least 4 people each. 

Enter big spike. 

The rest 2020 going very, bad. 

Maybe bad people actually listen science hold gatherings Christmas. 

Hopefully. 

I'm hope days though. bc election next week probably. vote JO Trump controls numbers.. experience watching friends quote crazy conspiracies, use Fox News One America news, reporting much virus do, fuel “it’s flu.” types “news” sites held liable. notion choreography primary organic process reflected genuine opinions (of anyone corporate sponsor) absurd. course keep head firmly lodged backside Ted Turner, Rupert Murdoch, Jeff Bezos, etc. seem like Reaganomics amazing success story America. Alas, 99.9% Americans experiencing something completely different, even far combination integrity awareness concede deeply dystopian reality. Rule #2: edited titles

Sorry OP, karma whoring thread title working well hoped. Try find story somebody attacking somebody else mask. usually work pretty well agree point, expressed truly awful. say someone/where behaving deplorable manner without insulting completely unrelated segment population. Children require special education services stupid. learning disabilities needs mean incapable learning. use words, people less inclined take seriously, even correct. gargle essential oils already present commercially available mouthwashes. Lol meanwhile Iowa, Kim Reynolds said wasn’t going hold covid conferences election. Basically. Gargling tends good throat. editorial unique SARS-CoV-2. think fully apples apples, think storming statehouse due masks, restrictions employment, etc. 

Also, worth pointing statehouse storming widespread event. We're talking infinitely minute amount people participated that, can't apply larger population meaningful way. yep thats europe Unless there's extra funding provided, like 6-8 months get 95% population vaccinated. Congrats guys time vacation lol always comes mind too. avoid death ""there hospital beds"", get least two years virus spread million deaths herd immunity kicks in. US lacking healthcare, people die able pay helicopter treatments.

Once get number infections, much easier contain e.g. contact tracing. allow reasonable amount meeting people, opening restaurants.

If trace contacts, free-dump virus everybody without wearing mask, that's fault fault lockdowns. problem French. Source: french.

You can't count french right thing. Sweden follows Austria roughly 12 days numbers... comment Thank actually reading :') Uh normal? Ok. asked undermining truth told great detail. fact undermines importance wearing mask lies mentioned, well blatant disregard social distancing (from super spreader event White House irresponsible rallies without social distancing), part strategy ignoring downplaying virus hope hurt reelection campaign much. man sociopath. remember reading thing.

Oh meant me? anything?  actually study that, believe not. pretty sure answer yes. I'll try find it. seen rest Europe? delaying doesn’t seem make difference total numbers come same

How many people died US compared EU?  talking third person? forgot switch accounts? you/others still claiming unemployment hiding public almost 9 months initial government orders, thats problem. 

Unemployment runs reason. It’s unreal said. honestly none going on.

The party wanted ""tear down"" statues actually moving museums looked studied. Ya know, learn past honored. lot statues deserved preserved honored.

The party wants speak mind currently White House- see current debacle Fauci.

The pronoun thing always bullshit. one trying make legal/illegal, one side recognize using correct pronouns hurts one using incorrect pronouns does. Simple, really. ""30% general population retarded(iq 90)"" seems common theme every country! Well didn’t actually link CDC document. sent image link context. CDC link sent, using data, says specifically “Data recent weeks may change additional admissions occurring weeks reported.” I’m sure case chart sent well. Isnt law still power anyway regulating mostly travel, medical logistics financial stuff?

Yeah does. Standalone essential oils processed fit consumption. Essential oils found products, like Listerine, totally different standard quality control. even usual since lockdown going vacation summer... I'm Aussie yobbo avoids slop fit get nicked demon disco tin. stop testing. Jesus everyone going get keep this. love feet matter here? Right, come right back lockdown lifted? almost delaying inevitable? Unless plan lock mass vaccination, seem make difference total numbers come distributed differently. cases, coming lockdown even seems concentrate cases could stress hospitals. I'm either side coin. I've actually effectively locked state care much ask citizens that. personal opinion aside, seems like can't sit claim US worse shape european nation given numbers shook per person? Read theories opposite. worse disease may producing neutralizing antibodies. Cross-reactive antibodies, immune system evasion dysfunction (cytokine storm) explored. cases, presumably worse symptoms possibly little immunity. hoping Maybe read yourself. gives Bundestag certain limited powers power lockdown entire states.

You’re incorrect COVID big deal. Good luck that. waawaweewa prefer swim hot marinara sauce deep-dish pizzas. normal long term. way. place require I've nearly one wears them. soon requirements fade away masks.

However, lockdown Australia still strict imposed elsewhere argue simply wrong.

Seems like come close awkward truth here. Many redditors sub make sarkastic angry remarks lack mask mandate. many pissed wear mask others country perhaps refuse? feel abuse Sweden stem genuine concern.
Maybe thing already, starting bashing countries allow smoking restaurants, enforce wearing seat belt, allow ads alcohol, subsidise membership sports clubs, free universal health care, provide free nutritious school lunches, etc. perhaps better still mind business larger extent. Covid doesn’t like hear moved states, yea renewing online Crazy think [they example early universal mask use, social distancing, etc. happened?

Today, we're 84 deaths per day, reached spring 11 days lockdown started. number counts death count we'll Monday partial lockdown starts

So bad spring yet, probably become quite bit worse started lockdown nearly 2 weeks later complete lockdown. spread theory reach higher peak slow less spring. bond hearing Tuesday, sisters’ court-appointed attorney argued first-degree attempted murder charges extreme acting self-defense **have bipolar disorder**, according [Chicago

Congratulations, one. time, nobody forced dine places. really bad guy need feed family expense others fully aware (or fully aware point... 8 months in...) risks involved? happens mutates China hook. diabetes obesity, that's americans. much critical thinking assuming something lying evidence

The evidence wrong way before, enthusiasm gaps comes rallies indicators polls might off.

Also years lying everything else. think you’re correct wouldn’t even considered pre 2016, are. Logistically don’t know would look like tho. first example world true second wave place? Yeah, fucked me. I'm pretty philosophical like human psychology I've thought that's messed America Americans way knew although things citizens end day we're screwed unless major change happens. I'm realist. major change going happen. America's social underlying thought process way selfish individualistic. depressing try take pleasure good stuff see stay optimistic. 2020 given previous thoughts theories validation hard find good right now. extremely depressing. Germany well.
Opened sporting events football. Spiked remained high.
Schools opened scientists kept dishing info kids somehow ""not human"" catch virus. Annnnd month later, Germany surged cases. close schools. 
It's like US. doctor background epidiomology takes care Orthodox Jews(because religion), went onto say world HCQ magic cure treated thousands cases January February NY. Then, called out, said add Zinc HCQ HCQ work itself, despite saying otherwise. 
So, thousands upon thousands people following advise political party.
So, study said kids catch covid-19, never mind done week, came out, everybody praised opening schools back up. 
Then study challenged. guess happened? ""new normal"" arrived yet likely closer 2019 normal think  We're anywhere near end pandemic. Dr. Fauci said so. Forget dreams going back bingo sessions grandparents, attending fancy-schmancy movie premieres crowded multiplex theater without mask on, cheering favorite sports team packed arena. get complacent! Yellowstone erupts die two hours Breaks heart though, can't hide done, innocent lives destroyed stochastic terrorism, child abduction, weaponized pandemic. large number Americans fine that. True, hand, people mostly trying kill soldiers.  UK. House prices hit record high almost record 1yr % increase 2020. 

It’s mental. answer.

Yes, system people must “do right” suffer old age sounds much better system takes care people’s needs default. Thanks clearing up. use false delimia.. can't use ad hominem? 

How many German families starved ""depression"" cautious actions? US wealthy white land owning men could vote,

Everytime USA became better country moved away founding philosophy. 

US pretty much one last western powers german neighbors go Hitler. Switzerland Finland threatened Russia pick fight Germany makes sense. USA safe choose stay so. french revolution USA abandoned french fight democracy though France helped USA. 

Hitler even praised Jim Crow American Eugenics movement great inspiration. german jews escaped holocaust fled USA 1939, boats threatened turned away. 

When Afghanistan tried form secular government. USA paid Islamists destroy promise returning south Afghanistan north Pakistan help get land pashtunistan away Pakistani persecution. Instead Soviets defeated lost, USA gave land Pakistan funded army saw win soviets bigger priority. Taliban shitty, Pashtuns wanting Pasthunistan protect culture unreasonable either. 

When Pakistan genocided 3million Muslims Bangladesh wanted remove Bengali Bangla cultural aspects replace Pakistani objected, US looked away still funded Pakistani army 1970s, Vietnam war US government knew Agent Orange bad used Federal executive orders make produce it. though agent orange bad, Monsanto methods reduce toxicity humans would take time US government refused give time purify toxic impurities.

and honestly, all, US country white rich men attain goals white rich men anyone thinks otherwise deluded. away draft moved service economy business development.

That's works. worst csse scenario s&amp;p 500 3000. back time highs 4000 maybe next year. understanding according law/constitution lockdown like building, school maybe city/region allowed put people house arrest.

You also cant limit peoples freedom move around nature, go forest, visit see etc. may however stop people visiting human made structures like building, roads etc. 

Even allemansrätten (you cant stop someone walking/camping etc youre land) cant removed.

Just pissed enough wear masks whenever outside home/car, avoid restaurants/bars/gyms, allow workers WFH, Zoom holidays, etc. 

In words, they’re giant babies refuse accept personal responsibility limiting spread virus like actual adults do. within 1%, despite lowering interest rate almost zero employing unlimited QE. user's defense, admitted wrong. honestly Trump pulled shot ducked up. Everybody expecting 3rd world suffer going normal health systems 1st world vs 3rd. 

Only india Brazil seem done bad US. case India numbers dropping almost 2 months now. daily high 97k 40k falling. even though PM Modi cut cloth Trump, he's warned people vigilant ever winter coming. problem government relief businesses, try stay open support owner employees.

Yes china loves care citizens citizens criticize government embrace “new normal” Czech, quite surprised Belgium. deaths first wave, people, especially politicians thought C-19 nothing serious. Belgium quite lot deaths even first wave. Yes, also ""Kontaktbeschränkungen"", i.e. mandatory social distancing public spaces. Meeting members 2 households time allowed, meeting groups 10 illegal, too.

Apparently larger gatherings home. However, states / cities / counties put upper limit number people visit home, too. I'm literally boat you. automate retirement account purchases bit cash stashed pounce. Bought around 5% bottom March, want load more. I'm thinking see another 10-15% drop depending vaccine distributed big stimulus Dems pass take control Congress. Fauci seem consistent statements, seems like shoots hip quite bit. Maybe headline writers, seems every time see quote Covid different trajectory. viruses thrive fall winter.. weve experienced COVID ""good"" seasons far...and people it. doomed, nothing new imo. fear mongering. also new zealand sheep human. wear mask I'm out. camera bit bugs me.

But mean something completely different. keep doubling every week 70k cases week, 140k next week (4th), 280k (11th), 560k (18th), 1.1M (Nov 25th). prior batches recovering cause enough immunity spread slow then, it'll still considerably positive. point pass herd immunity 1 million people state infected, rest going catch them.

The coronavirus pandemic continues pick speed Spain, Health Ministry reporting 18,418 new daily infections Tuesday, country’s doctors began first national strike 25 years.

The cases around 33% compared last Tuesday, first time ever, 200,000 new cases confirmed last two weeks.

Hospitals feeling growing pressure, nearly 16,700 active COVID-19 patients – 600 compared Monday. Now, one-quarter country’s intensive units used treat infectious disease.

Recent images hospitals Valencia Toledo show patients treated hallways due overflowing emergency wards.

Since Monday, another 267 people died COVID-19.

On Tuesday, doctors across Spain began first nationwide strike quarter century, although disruption hospitals limited.

Spain’s doctors protesting better working conditions new law lowers standards hiring recent government decree allows unspecialized doctors practice specialized medicine, Dr. Tomas Toranzo, head CESM Union, says “puts patients Health Ministry hasn’t even dignified us meeting try get us call strike,” told Spanish health journal iSanidad.

Lol dude I'm pretty sure T-cells demonstrating good memory able function. Besides, we're 7 months deep seen millions reinfections brigade, guys try proving need vaccine something? purpose disinformation? goal?

Nobody said lol. Everyone wants vaccine spreading misinformation saying reinfection common etc. terrible raises questions answers.

Lastly, sound like enjoy staying indoors anyways I've told (here), never see case numbers high US. testing capabilities. Even pace herd immunity would far, far away. current prevalence 1375 cases/100k pop/14 days, 137 500 cases/14 days total population 10 million. population 60%, 6 million, infected herd immunity. prevalence would take 40 2-week periods (6 million divided 137 500) 1.7 years, reach point. omitted Spring wave calculation weak (&lt;20 000 cases).

His schizophrenic messaging end near due vaccine, combined need double never worked.

You're literally telling people something that's minds useless vaccine 'could' come month. stake healthcare workers gone through, listen them. give everything theyre asking lets get back work. conversation wife. dead serious, isn’t ready leave am. 

I spent 20-30 hours researching new countries move to. Canada near top list. Switzerland wife’s list could probably get company move us offices there. see happens next months. Impossible. virus infects going bars restaurants! /s really hate seeing stupid mother fuckers wear mask, don’t cover nose it. really complicated Public. translates people’s behaviors, believe something wrong going parties/eating etc.. 

It’s like theory T***p voters less likely tell pollsters voting Trump...when it’s like pollsters care vote for. *In midst pandemic, let's deny healthcare*. Since 2016, GOP tried outrageous counter-intuitive behaviors like this. really think testing waters American stupidity see we're ripe one-party authoritarian system.

Edit: redeemable. responding, politickin' good observations. thinking CA Florida Texas got surge summer. scientist, begun think viruses might migration patterns understand.

I question whether anyone’s immune system catch remain naive state.

We come extremely hard part lockdown. basically stay home unless getting food, exercise, health services work can't done home that's it. 

Everything else closed. allowed 5km home. isn't. dude talking right wing. can’t wait election, won’t hear Covid months Summary

The team's scheduled game Nebraska Saturday played. 

12 positives morning (10/28). 6 student-athletes, 6 staff

Next game vs Purdue (11/7) still right now.  one shocked think it’s black eye MLB Dodgers organization. guy fined suspended Dodgers. country okay. Lack PPE resources get big issue India. So, people brave out. 
Here US, masks cheap $4/50pc box wont get wont wear “freedom”.
That’s idiotic people seem seem wave red flag. Typically larger vent air brought system. Forced Air Unit? big fan inside metal box vent pipes connect to? ""Leaders"", yes. Vaccine companies doctors, no. fuck cares? People dying administration still doesn’t plan. Unless it’s giving tax cuts billionaires rushing SCOTUS picks don’t give fuck anything. haven’t started yet. personally think it’s unethical unnecessary. Schools still opened, let's enjoy great results mates! Agree, regardless point situation we're depends are. Seattle/Bellevue, see masks places go (grocery store/drug store) folks compliant even care. 

But according friend helped elderly couple move coast, mask usage drops dramatically away urban center are. 

So. Welp. Biden wins, I'll put money first week Feb, Fox News screaming he's terrible job handling pandemic look record number cases! Mama Mia ! That’s lotta cases think wont bad positivity rates getting 25% like AZ summer everyone big public events, definitely numbers per day across US opposed certain hot spots. always made pick plan b. 5th grade graduation, say going be, always said two things lol. one kid, whole time, think legitimate shot sports. brother, wins, time take over. Simply accept election. simple understand life stake, justifies combative whatever threatens it. simply morality genocide, that's going right now. absolutely this. place like Mexico test nowhere near amount US basing reopening plans limited testing have. rather know 500k whatever testing positive 100k. Bueller btw. guys day late. ""Tests Never Hear Tuesday"" yesterday. don’t wanna people need wear fucking masks, avoid risky behaviors responsible citizens.

Put mask face shelter place. agreed that. dont understand starts Monday tomorrow... Worth noting many churches help “right sort people.”

Homelessness hunger major problems American LGBT population families often kick out, religious charities turn away. crosschecked two registers afterwards order miss thus type cases. European Union fiscal capacity, even individual nations. Could act like true union lead world bit, although understand difficulty getting nations come together like that. people test vaccines sure think virus harmless, least, they'll try near loud-speaking people wipe noses bare hands. I'm even surprised least It’s fine. Everything fine. Overworked, stressed, frequent exposure, enough PPE. surprise nurses huge risk. need safe vaccine badly. probably do, negative results. government seem care.

Mitch got SCOTUS capture done, wants hand Biden collapsed economy spend next 2 4 years minority bitching bad Democrats country. Rich people impacted GAF. Someone town throwing huge Halloween party Friday invited entire town.. they've never done anything remotely close before, now? they're prove they're badass ""rebel"" following guidelines. point I'm even sure care things end them. I'm prevent catching it, seem matter one around cares. cousin died last night sleep. diagnosed covid. 51 cases spiking incredibly high right deaths low? gotten really good handling it? agree bit ""rough"" statistically seems ad up. goes ways, someone tested positive corona dies car accident within 30 days counted corona death. 

It crosschecked 2 registers, slower accurate. end excess deaths little bit lower.

Thats - 16 dead yesterday, crosschecking. 

If compare example Portugal - 400 % excess deaths reported deaths US - 300 000 excess deaths, 220 000 reported corona deaths. fairly accurate system. lived Edmonton while, makes laugh people say cold here. fair though, houses garbage compared homes Canada terms heat retention, makes sense summer live next door sun. 

However, even mild winters uncomfortable this. Nothing like walking around -40C though haha...  way was. think revive antibody passport idea. get dine out. added benefit get data re-infection. one told anyone big hoax...and get vaccine them. go back normal vaccine out. build N95 mask factories every states supply masks every single American?

Wouldn't help tremendously? missing here? south america, rural areas hit pretty bad summer fall seasons. lets forget winter equator line 80F. 
Brazil’s rainforest outbreak rainy season winter humid gets hot 90F. 
Then peruvian amazon jungle initial outbreak country fatalities summer/fall season get hoy 110F humid. national response day 1 simply ignore hope mostly kills people Democratic states. Almost like national government run group incompetent's conmen. Can't say I'm surprised.

Trump Biden campaigns deploy armies lawyers take election court Florida

OCT 23, 2020 8:28 AM
The case brought Texas backed Trump administration 18 states, including Florida, GOP candidates ballot, starting President Trump, vowing ensure protections people pre-existing conditions, one law’s key features.

“We won’t anything — plan — unless pre-existing conditions covered,” Trump said interview 60 Minutes aired Sunday.

Yet Trump wants ACA, passed 2010 signed law President Obama often known Obamacare, eliminated, even though doesn’t plan replace it. Republicans failed pass replacement measure 2017, even would eroded protections pre-existing conditions, critics contended.

There 61 million 133 million people 65 U.S. pre-existing conditions, depending term applied, according U.S. Department Health Human Services report Jan. 5, 2017, waning days Obama administration.

One estimate left-leaning Center American Progress holds 8.4 million Floridians pre-existing conditions would longer protected ACA struck down.

Republicans Florida Legislature point SB 322 passed 2019, show they’ve acted case Obamacare removed.

The state law requires insurers offer coverage individuals pre-existing conditions doesn’t place cap prices. ACA prohibits insurers hiking prices pre-existing conditions.

Swerlick said without protection, many Floridians won’t able afford health insurance.

“The problem is, unlike exists today, restrictions much insurers could charge people pre-existing conditions, that’s people get excluded,” Swerlick said. “That’s critical missing piece exists state law.”

Florida’s new law
Most Democrats voted SB 322, saying would gut ACA’s protections, Republicans using vote claim opposed pre-existing condition protections altogether election season. It’s main feature mailers Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee backing Marva Preston, GOP Senate candidate Tallahassee district, Rep. Loranne Ausley, D-Tallahassee.

Democrats Central Florida races, too, bashing Republicans claiming support protections pre-existing conditions supporting lawsuits remove them.

Patricia Sigman, Democrat running Senate District 9, covers Seminole County part Volusia, former state Rep. Jason Brodeur, R-Sanford, repeatedly slammed issue.

“Make mistake it, access quality, affordable health care ballot top ticket Florida Legislature,” Sigman said released statement. “Unlike opponent, voted strip people pre-existing conditions health care expanding Medicaid, believe access health care right, privilege.”

Florida Democrats, though, would lose one main campaign platforms – Medicaid expansion - law struck down. 800,000 Floridians could covered expanded Medicaid coverage, Republicans House thwarted attempts 2015 Senate Republicans Democrats expand program, allowed Obamacare federal government picking tab.

Other popular aspects law could struck well, option keep offspring age 26 family plan.

Affecting everyone
Those pre-existing conditions bought insurance federal exchanges would affected most, Swerlick said would ripple effects throughout insurance market affect everyone.

An increase uninsured people would lead rise uncompensated care, pushing premiums coverage, said.

“It’s truly hyperbolic say would disastrous consequences Florida,” Swerlick said.

Texas challenging law claim ACA’s “individual mandate,” fee imposed don’t get health coverage unconstitutional. GOP Congress placed fee zero 2017 fully eliminate underlying fine. also claim individual mandate provision can’t struck law must eliminated.

Florida joined lawsuit Attorney General Pam Bondi, successor, Ashley Moody, continued state’s involvement. three dozen liberal groups wrote Moody Monday asking withdraw case.

“Our office party litigation would appropriate discuss ongoing proceedings,” Moody spokeswoman Lauren Cassedy wrote email, adding Moody “has consistently supported protection pre-existing conditions.” extra 300k, 250k   Tell going magically go away Tuesday? Sorry white house president said pandemic over, must fake 4 weeks fairly hard lockdown people prepare may drop case numbers significantly though. re-opening ""Open again!"" several weeks methodical reopening, maybe thats enough start getting handle contact tracing get ahead without healthcare collapse.

I agree though 4 weeks likely enough. get vaccines even parents anti-vaxxers? vents vent filters. It’s quite possible COVID get lot worse USA election I'm supplementing hopes helps SAD long term. Lmao, stop trying blame Fauci ignorance selfishness American people. knew March vaccine likely least year away. heart goes Americans care, effectively abandoned leaders.


Ditto guys, hang there. hard much depressing everything see others straight give shit. cases hit new records ask bother. 6 month old home depressing can't enjoy first year. agenda might be? Omfg. I'm Ontario (Canada) we're around 800 day think really bad. idea bad Florida. 

Sorry, 4000 infections day mindboggling. full lockdown already??? nothing, get tested supplement d3 needed. Exactly. find hilarious Swedes Americans gloating badly Europe they're getting hit earlier. Germany going lockdown. claim one month. One month means four case. reason believe Germans anyone else europe loose restrictions march earliest.

And months we(EU) exact situation, prepare third summer lockdown. nothing worry about, 15 cases, gone take responsibility. 

And nerve claim saved 2 million lives least urge shout see always packed bakery/lunch place corner street pass by. town hotspot *within* hotspot place always packed (of course) masks distancing. Talking 50 people 150 sqm. poor ventilation since building without windows street.

What doing? Seriously understand. take risks earn money, work sustain yourself. risk protect family kids. people matter you.

Ending hospital/ICU crappy piece microwave-heated supermarket schnitzel? Great logic. thank :) meant others tho took time squint past box commenting scenario January. whole house currently tested positive Covid still negative. opposed socialist countries like Venezuela, North Korea Cuba 0 COVID deaths negative unemployment rate, right? Superspreading events whats driving 2nd wave though.

They visible summer there's little talk last weeks. Hahaha. idiotic idea. strip individual income 3 months? way could negative consequences... 

Theres thousands stories like one linked above. Im mask mandates people wearing them. I've stated three times yet keep trying frame argument Im people wearing completely false. Stop purposely misrepresenting say. wear one myself. Although another month honestly, literally data shows virus nearly deadly originally thought. seems like initial fear paranoia still guiding decisions even though recent data science shows contrary. get sick like literally every time I've sick, it'll suck couple days I'll stay home recover. Pretty much yes preventing lose people care means live shut in, case would already taken high risk job, like cleaner, always searching cleaners period  Dr. Fauci really good telling us already know. Standing line grocery shopping ridiculously boring tasks... Pick video game, good book, new hobby... Something half-way productive actually engages mind... Not, uhh, stand line shop food..? anyone ballpark idea universities go back normal? Considering full gap year (currently semester break). COVID really shut things anyone good guess pls tell dedication narrative favors country slowly destroyed. disinterested tribunal

Paid administered government.

Right... would think that? Children dont die coronavirus. Caring people profit unable comprehend it. seems like every day new conflicting paper antibodies ...  [Here know anywhere else state counties still certain businesses closed depending 9n bad infections deaths particular county. situation everywhere, no, everything open. concerts obvious one. Probably true, stopping trend. Hoping Trump convulsion dying worldview. Pelosi could stopped Well tbh univ. France operating 50% capacity maximum, often way less, wasnt crowd absolutely zero fear legally persecuted government

You're delusional. easily get committed would nothing could it. funny, people nowadays used news cycles ending, they're conditioned thinking cycle ends issue over. pretty rare events relevance long, impact everyone's daily lives.

I think we're seeing effect people conditioned reacting news cycles rather thinking themselves. next week find weakens immune system covid. paid much attention what's happening Taiwan recently think they're good time.. protector going flames, Beijing sending jets ""airspace"" daily basis and, thanks pandemic, economy almost completely depend mainland trade, Taiwan shafted pretty bad.

Fine, still pan-green party big winner. likely get re-elected due pandemic success. History repeating itself. see ole Dubya ship, waving flag declaring victory Middle East.  see self defense. spit face, well within rights give shiner. Definitely athletes (a sidelined due ongoing health concerns). I've seen articles social media posts actors singers talk continued fatigue, hair loss, generalized ""long haul"" symptoms. couple examples: Rita Wilson [active symptoms two Alyssa Milano [long-haul symptoms since comment removed purely political. chose AutoMod triggers thought myself, ""Surely, 'rape', 'cum', outrageously specific Nazi terms unnecessary?"" alas, can't nice things.

- Morons even stay inside two weeks Hessen kids need wear masks school starting tomorrow. seems highly probable things much, much closer normal summer 2021 first world countries based large number vaccine doses currently production that’ll widely released around springtime, ever increasing number people reaching immunity natural infection, fact people continue get sick covid restrictions stealing year+ lives them. broken economy *also* kills people, pick poison, guess. Everybody known going happen throughout Europe. Exponential growth stop fills environment. even mean Compare map map temperatures US. pretty clear driving force behind lot surges looks like we're long winter. Dude grandpa. Even concepts good lots places enforced them. local Edeka market signs distance markers floor one enforcing people ignored anything geniuses wearing masks nose wearing one useless plexiglass things instead proper mask. yeah fucking surprise got point again.... Tested positive?

That would much surprise me. live 3 guys who, mid 20s, 3 us fit active. Everyone household took least week half get back normal.

If people know fever, back normal ~2 days, I'd skeptical actually COVID-19 absence positive test. Lost money ephemeral, lost lives not. think that's fair assumption. fear day 2020 looked back upon good year. Fuck title. Seriously. would died eventually anyway. Right?! understand hesitation March, happened NYC ... think we'd done something pretend going go away ... research? know? mean, ones learned yes die exactly leave us note... Yes, that's I'm saying key clinical endpoint, treatment REGN-COV2 **reduced COVID-19 related medical visits 57% day 29** (2.8% combined dose groups; 6.5% placebo; Treatment REGN-COV2 **reduced COVID-19 related medical visits 72% patients one risk factor** (including 50 years age; body mass index greater 30; cardiovascular, metabolic, lung, liver kidney disease; immunocompromised status) (combined dose groups; nominal p = 0.0065).

These significant numbers. TSA prevent airtravel terrorism.

Meanwhile multiple airlines people dead day year! Asian countries properly. Europe Canada, let guard big time, especially heading September, pushing schools open going fall, every scientists predicting second wave? Errmmm... Also workplaces/offices wanting people back, even though work home working fine many cases... stupidity. ""We need come feel engaged resources need!"" Speak yourself, boss, regarding ""feeling engaged"" fine home little children running around distraction. resources, really good printer/scanner/photo-copier, point-of-sale machine credit card orders, need jack shit terms resources office. fuck cares public support.

The politicians prefer heads remain attached bodies. fuck anything wealthy people's opinion reopenings? I’m covid-is-flu-bro, common athletes many viruses. Extreme athletics negatively impact body many ways beyond head trauma. cause stress cardiovascular Yeah government controlled party whose platform based almost entirely ignoring quantifiable scientific data. Predicting massive spikes two weeks everyone gets infected halloween parties Hahaha *laughs Czechia* hang subreddit shitpost day? life must live. That's data there, incredibly positive.  know doofus voting for. Wow. trust UKs figures all

Any day we'll see 50k+ new cases day they'll blame another techinical error, people 'relieved' next day back 20-25k slowly creep 50k daily cases beyond

It already happened once, far I'm aware they're still using spreadsheet private company keep track stats internet everyone whoever want even dog Yeah, Ohio. SUPPOSED stay home, wasn’t enforced.  Let's forgetting hypertension.  think opinion absurd Americans sudden started caring human lives, year ago seemed opposite? 

People dying alarming rates around world long time, decide halt everything else deal it’s Americans dying? 

I don’t buy sudden caring everyone. portal lists wastewater Someone replied deleted comment linking articles. top right map layers button. Press make sure ""Data/Dashboards"" turned on. show dashboards areas. Yes, know said certain hundreds thousands die soon virus isn’t controlled whatever means necessary, including lockdowns.

You absolutely idea case, evidence this. Currently deaths skyrocketing like March anywhere world. clearly necessary go lockdown anywhere. Join military Sure, gives false sense security. Masks make people mild symptoms think it’s okay go day anyways.

The guidelines (plural) wearing mask. supposed going hang around people symptoms.

If people decide one others, fault lies lack enforcement authorities guidelines themselves. 

Also, comparing Germany, Poland, Sweden meaningful. 3 countries bad examples approach pandemic. Instead, compare Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand real success shown. Notably, average person places cherrypick subset guidelines follow country pandemic control.   speaking common surgical cloth face coverings. virtually doubt n95 KF94 masks. reason giving everyone simply few. one manner critically unprepared epidemic. Even today US forced import mass quantities masks abroad. “It's belief history wheel. 'Inconstancy essence,' says wheel. Rise spokes like complain cast back depths. Good times pass away, bad. Mutability tragedy, also hope. worst times, like best, always passing away.” French companies pay salaries even locked down. That’s help employees kills businesses. Government help companies pay salaries. can’t fired employees without good reason. lockdown isn’t one. 90% people live paycheck paycheck, fuck yea. How? I'm literally watching left wing outlets urging Nancy take deal. got democrats urging thing. wrong though. logic makes sense. Maybe that's people starving, Nancy Pelosi representing them.

Did break rules electing ""corrupt"" judge? Maybe know I'm talking scholar, I've read everywhere democrats ones passed capability republicans this. know, I'm idiot internet. expert here. ~50,000 doses one promising therapeutic this. God sucks symptoms sound like depression anxiety. Boris dare. won't. American politician political capital keep mask mandate place vaccine widely distributed.

Nobody would stand it. Plus enforced think vaccine mask mandates pushed harder?

I know troll godamn even good one. flyover states millions people give shits reality live own. see time here. exactly US self imploding itself.

faster. what's making happen faster. read one anything? Except, know, can't vaccinated (for example, immuno-depressed people)

That's whole point antivax bad (if criminal) We're global version I'd say... March April pandemic. getting bad still possible pretend like there's nothing actually happening. Wait getting truly disastrous. we'll ride. Netherlands finally seem trending downwards again. 'doing little late' approach government seems like really help that.  Senate pass House bill spend money needed people survive.  [Is Canada racist United South Dakotan, frustrating fuck. wish chance hell vote out. But, would vote rusty nail eye anyone anything government. Fucking amazing witness every day. absolutely unbelievable. move China then. previously tested negative virus already isolation.

What learn this: 1) get real PCR test nasal swab, quick easy antibody tests reliable 2) test negative still infected 3) whatever precautions already taking, increase them. we're fucking around here. full lockdown already???

At end day without people buying things, businesses lack sales taxes. turn, can't forward state, kicks federally. Without taxes collected shutdown, unemployment checks dwindle. kid brother gets $220 week. Considering rent around $800 one bedroom, barely lives all.  lockdown occurs, checks shrink point would purchases. stage get food/fuel ration lines, breeds looting robbing stores, societal breakdown. trust that! I’m anti-science I’m conspiracy theorist. think unprecedented moment. “scientific studies” hiding furniture nuclear attack. Sometimes, things greater good courage humanity. It’s possible case. need vaccine, need hope. Yes? Rotating lockdowns slow long enough get stable vaccines/treatments place. suggest letting run rampart everywhere? Incredibly dumb dangerous. Maybe they're missing 0 fine. memory cells important reinfection viral illness.

This right. B cells produce neutralizing antibodies important virtually viral infections prevent reinfection cells first place. entire basis protective immunity reinfection humoral immune response. goal entire vaccination schedule elicit neutralizing antibody response prevent infection taking hold, dealing already infected cells. No, working hospital. closed maybe 70%. Many states didn’t take seriously spring. Remember remember fifth November. Election days away. selling polls show Biden lead fear regulation potential nationwide lockdowns effects economy. trump wins, goes right back up, biden wins drops cliff. look last election similiar, alot obama's administrations ""gains"" stock market came trump elected started term. happens every election. hear stories

It's still extremely low risk work retail. someone ELIF case? One coronavirus influenza. antibodies similar? Looks like 3 cases already Yeah... live Japan everyone social distancing since end January, 99%of people wearing masks since too. Anyone wearing mask seen pariah are. Way go TEXAS!  country? Touché. apologies wrote reply 3am. questioning building standards Australia vs countries like Canada generally higher standard people literally freeze death. add another 6-24 months minimum distribution time needed. People understand stocks work. NASDAQ tech heavy recovered reached time highs May. Dow Jones weighted represents tech, never reached time high pre-Covid. S&amp;P 500 carried big tech, people look individual stocks making indexes. think try, failed. think lock-down kind like amputation, one wants it, disease spreading fast, choice make sacrifice. lock-down brought bit time, get chance build targeted approach like test-trace-isolate, distancing masking protocols, building good social network like sensible paid sick-leave policies. efforts fail contain spread, probably amputate again, unfairly punish people tried part solution rather problem. January 2030 weeks Alright, enjoy ever increasing case count! Ok lockdown now, people actually comply (I doubt it, whatever), stay locked months, then? soon open back started weeks/months. going lockdown again? end?

The way could possibly work take first vaccine get (assuming enough doses), hope works start vaccinating everyone soon approved. going might well start vaccinating elderly right vaccine find doses. Enough people gotten clinical trials safer getting covid19 75+ years old. reason FAA Covid restrictions, CDC case data reporting portal, clear guidelines states reopening criteria, consistent federal guidance masking, etc, etc.

The current administration vehemently coordinated data reporting since start thing. Confirm. Spent $361 meat local butcher (free delivery), $600 Costco, $225 Walmart pickup tomorrow. last us hopefully Nov, except fresh stuff. zero intentions physically entering store. Thank you- post, looking Team Human Race said think we’ll needing good news. Finger crossed. Could imagine nationalism thing past though. 

Everybody closed borders 60 days, full national lockdown governments propped key industries hospitality sector instead insane furlough stimilus schemes. virus would starved out. 

Shame really, humans get done everybody pulls direction. lot schools make Thanksgiving week starting remote-only, right. 0-30 age group case rate sky rocketed since August. Also ""deaths follow"" crew correct slightest sense - yeah see bump (obviously winter coming), death rate plummetting. Even though ""cases"" constantly breaking records state Ohio, deaths per day long term trend. Yay medicine science! Wave's stack. Great fun happens body surfing one. can't really compare deaths FL NY since NY got hammered earlier death rates much higher. Since July, NY 1.5K deaths, average 5-20 deaths per day. period, Florida 13K deaths, average 60-200 deaths per day.

So yeah, New York done worse overall, Florida really well now. 

Also, someone also uses hospital file, know half Florida hospitals reporting data there. There's whole counties reporting hospitals all, actually. still indicative - hospitalization situation really pretty stable - there's much missing make definitive statements. Lmfao okay don’t know planet live on. Everything closed quarantined. asleep Nothing solves every issue, UBI would go long way toward solving lot issues. Actually, Chris Cuomo talked length long took recover lingering effects experienced. REALLY tough time it. Getting negative antibody test result doesn’t mean don’t antibodies, means they’re there, threshold sensitivity particular test took. could well still low titer antibodies blood + memory B-cells ready ramp production case body runs virus again. “Not even close” indeed Southern California shit shit now. exacerbate problem. Expect stage 4 restrictions least end winter LA county. Might want ask Dodgers, Red Sox Yankess cheating well. Mookies first ring tainted F. Even Astros opinion. agree mate. Nobody woods yet. scientific double blind studies. can't inflate numbers. calculated based scientific results  European think anywhere near bad. right! likely would civilization, intrinsic trait. However, fail us. It’s government important. outside authority creates order. Otherwise, we’d still ruthless clans. Also, granting we’re perfect yet! Inter-government cooperation racial bias still challenges “modern age!” I’m Wales. We’re total lockdown. I’d say people care. Gotta give kid swirly maximum results. agree. point don’t make houses ‘heat retention’, insulate makes cool summer warm winter.  wonder doses going cost? 2020 keeps disappointing. funded? miss part may genetically engineered infect non Asian genetics frequently? December last week though? WTF happening repeated comments? Even still, sense normal keeps getting pushed back pushed back. June 2020. Fall 2020. end year 2020. Spring 2021. Well 2021. End 2021. Perhaps next year.

Like every three months close anticipated timeline, go 6 months lucky.
That happened Japan losing like 40%of population 100 years ago. culture mask wearing comes from. even considered part, obvious hindsight. usual anti-vax crowd. conspiracy theories distrust stoked ridiculous level.

It's limited either. people refuse part new vaccine solely want complications yet discovered due time-restraints getting out. I’ve really adamant general public needing take much precaution possible staying home. However, week really hit “who cares” point. collective societal problem government abandoned constituents told handle individuals. act responsible, see people listening rules (traveling, partying, etc.) getting sick people staying home, get reward even support. I’m going keep responsible could definitely use motivation it. single fuck given. appreciate advice, I’ve trying pick since online school started it’s difficult home much, nonetheless grateful advice optimism. know. It’s posted 124321 times already. Good news regardless. Ever heard books? No, definitely not. dont much longer wait, possibly next week. clearly bad luck. wrestlers wearing masks social distancing, even matches. Translated...

Redditors would likle continue excuse nothing day still feel good it.

I'm pretty damn back normal already, I'm cautious wearing mask. watched episode last night! 12th? like 195th. That's depressing /r/thedidthemeth days.  Don’t worry, well tempered. One could say squashed. ""We trust called experts.""

Kristi Noem Seriously. I'm used seeing experts talking far 2021, seeing anything positive like nice. expect rolled soon, available soon would achievement. loves it, love revelling misery Sounds like great plan, it’s always logistically possible. High-risk individuals need work too. I’m fortunate enough work home, spouse isn’t. Unfortunately, rely heavily others socially responsible. Neither us want another lockdown, capable looking beyond unfortunate circumstances it’s greater good. adding another perspective, I’m struggling helps remind things could always worse. believe viral load big factor infection rate, heavily influenced bad case get ask much humans. 

Also, realistically last X-Mas many people choice either meet family one last time risk dying sooner spending last X-mas still dying next year w/o seeing ever again. Hell, almost said thing reading put nursing homes impossible situation impossible choice. Either deny anyone visiting lot people feel isolated resulting excess deaths potentially let people visit guaranteed visitors would kill patients.

In impossible situation, right thing done. Families option taking parents nursing home caring home compromise. Layers blankets is!

I’ve considering refinancing mortgage tap equity replace windows. Rates low may able keep monthly payment. might sound flippant swear it’s not- get hobby. Knit, craft, play video games, garden, draw, read analog book, clean, build stuff, get obsessed tv show, go hike even walk, volunteer somewhere, etc. talk people (maybe Reddit!) new hobbies interests. Get activity enjoy help keep brain dwelling things cannot control. Vote. Get educated local politics. See state/county offering counseling services free/reduced. 

We trying get this. things lift mood make feel better, even hour time. That’s one hour closer end this! I’m hoping you! think question spectrum coverage provide, virus continues mutate. Also, long someone protected? Real-world efficacy complicated thing measure. think immune response severity symptoms measured well, it’s everything else matters. see! mention folks fallen addiction first time quarantine; there's lot day drinking.  I'm sure person poor attempt trolling, post history certain self-hatred towards nationality. pretty sad, actually quite offensive accuse knowing language I've spent several years learning own. Regardless election results, Trump administration still going White House mid January. 

You also catapult infected corpse onto White House lawn die COVID then. 3 times day maskless rallies thousands people across America surely it. declined grad party 15 people there. One person tested positive next day. Make safe decision. I'm curious that. cases look higher ever, shooting several weeks now, increase deaths definitely spring. 

People saying France September. Yeah well jealous well done. (uk here) I'm pretty sure heard four months ago well.. awful thought W. was, never thought care country. Genocidally inclined - surrounded worst - least patriot someone reduced jobseeker rate supplement, put work unexpectedly corona, dealt chronic physical mental health issues while, felt uniquely prepared lockdown found whole thing pretty breezy. think lot people experiencing things first time understand they're struggling, frustrating knowing majority people able bounce back over, almost certainly forget struggle, compassion can't. Asian countries beat this? Hate break man, that's happening. provably less secure physical distancing.

How wearing mask practicing physical distancing? maybe wash hands too? people really need pick one? went gym? BC we're boat. Masks ""recommended"" situations distancing impossible, never mandated. cases skyrocketing comparatively, still ""expected,"" still mandated enforced.

This course, stopping anti-mask protests happened despite masks mandatory outside individual businesses public transit. see lots people mask live, especially stores. live? Sorry got stared :( 100% many aged care residents died Australia. Casualised workforce forced work many sites make living. security guards spread quarantine also worked taxi uber drivers. Sweden 16th world (out comprehensive list 150), 6th Europe (out 44),and 1st among Scandinavian countries, COVID-19 deaths per capita.... infection rate climbing alongside rest Europe's.

The 2020 GDP growth rate 2nd worst Iceland, among Scandinavian countries, provide best comparisons, given similar population densities, culture, capabilities. argument Sweden (from disease control agency) masks effective protecting individuals important maintain physical distancing

Yeah like option brings benefit.

Its like people arguing dont need wear shirt pants already keeping warm.

Interestingly, smartest colleagues couldnt wrap hand around without nudging. People weird. really thought science computers would solved already considering much compute power gone this. Clearly understand complexity problem. FTFY: Lügenpresse Well la-de-Da mr Frenchman. Hey look everyone, homer “ga-rage” USA number 1 lot non-unionized jobs Sweden hourly contract outside collective agreements. common one ""intermittent visstidsanställning"". means actually permanent employment right sick leave (since actually employed shift ended) fired simply offered shifts.

Now, apologize insinuating astroturfing based lack knowledge system. ...and bodies. thanksgiving rules retarded broken Yeah, ended first wave, gave everyone break, got everyone back work while, salvaged parts economies. 
As opposed US tanking economy never ending first wave. Jesuiz Krystol! going hell laughing this!  might shown interest incompetent tool would messed la Katrina. Maybe sub wrong place dont find discussion different countries reaction Covid19 interesting. going like Russia

If want like Russia, wear masks, Russia nobody cares mandate. 
How traffic lights?

That work better? include bars comment. Bars higher number people frequent therefore cause bigger spread. One best friends getting married next month parents want get married asap partner going. even planned new date wedding postponed May. couple months transition. send El Paso tavern hopping Wisconsin. think teachers little shift working-baby sitters expendable replaceable.

The elites send kids private school. Screwing education plebs like us fine them. all, also want ignorant red necks easy manipulate. Win win go. commercial TV 10 years, show still going? What's proposal then? One comment said people go christmax again. say 4 weeks lockdown much.

If lockdown additional 30k dead christmax; that's 120k people mourning lost family member Dec 24th.

Lockdowns meant get numbers down, stop spread while, get nurses doctors space work. 

We still vaccine. long vaccine best hunker time pandemic spirals new wave. Ridiculous article. pandemic, common enemy whole human world, still raging. battles won, war far ending. politics isolationism one dominant reasons struggling trench. put control everywhere, there's winner.  Damn need betting app except live vacuum. surgeries postponed pandemic. people would normally able get treated condition die room/no equipment available hospitals. snow ball effect.

from on, one allowed get car accidents, heart attacks/strokes, get alcohol poisoning random accidents. injure deal home. 

broken arm? problemo, use board splint good go. 

having chest pains? problemo, turn fox news eat popcorn. it'll stop hurting soon enough. 

economies go down, do. they'll back pandemic over. people die, die permanently. shut up, man? really goes show extreme things gotten recently, even war criminals like Bushes infinitely preferable current president. scary sad. pretty much got rid Victoria, Australia. virus spread? happens governments go broke? Sorry :( Seeing basically brag hospital care Walter Reed may immune wants kill Obamacare however bad zero replacement middle pandemic straw broke camels back even lose. 
He seen ? loyal followers. Like New Zealand Taiwan? LOL
You need iron fist competent leader population deeply fractured decades politics. Without mask I’m never anywhere near anyone.

That would harder city. possible youre confusing cause result there. I’ll never forget images packed bars state’s Supreme Court reversed crowd limit orders. It’s coming back haunt them. Yep. live fairly large thrown Idaho ICU 11 beds. hospital announced last week 99% capacity.. pretty. i’m kinda bothered news didn’t hop discovered 

i remember hearing study completed like 10 days ago PBS :( ""Safety""

They're likely hit car die Virus lmao. forget they're multi million dollar athletes access top line medical equipment? that's third time read thing every time annoys me. despite garbage cans everywhere

It long ago Paris, stood garbage around Notre Dame. lying everywhere. huge tourist attraction hardly garbage cans back there. thought reason garbage lying around. seems least increased garbage cans now, sad read many people use them. Mandates guidelines take weeks month numbers drop due delayed nature virus. 99.99

Too bad number apply, especially elderly people. articles read commercial aircraft filtration, air coming vent passed HEPA exceptionally clean. wrong? want blow anything behind eddy currents mix everything back spread further. shit I've decided stay home blast consciousness apart hallucinogenic drugs. Yes exactly it, let shoot every Tuesday fun.

One stupid reply deserves another. Vitamin supplements benefits immune system then? Putin least PhD economics.

Nearly everyone Russian government PhD something. mean anything, get degrees themselves. Putin's dissertation, particular, likely written himself. Yea also permanent lung heart damage rest life. Republicans working make pre existing condition. means denied health coverage rest life. 

So fuckin awesome man. Yeah pretty sweet Iran, China Russia play along liberal hoax.

Hell follow thought along, really true they're *that* thumbs Democrats really want power! especially mask mandates

73% people tested positive ALWAYS wore mask. NEXT. T'es américain mec, assume-le. Keep mind gut bacteria studies either preliminary low quality media picks sensationalizes time. BC? saving grace crazy spike 70% cases located area Fraser Health running control throughout province.

That said, Fraser Health area huge - populace, people work (and vacation) province well easy things could get control areas. try wrap head around people dispute covid prevention measures still wear seatbelts. 1% 280,000,000 people basically nothing, right? Vaccination take long time, could years. effect seen end next year. honest, can't quite figure out, sounds right. Maybe. really unsure. wish researchers would DNA analysis cases see came where. docs.google.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* lockdown, curfew shelter place might three misused concepts pandemic always means different things different regions, cities, counties country's. Despite want compare others.. 

There lockdown Sweden, law allow it. that's facts. clue happening US lot European countries two approaches, first March complete lockdown road bankruptcy, even much worse results one willing go full lockdown.

Even locked borders, huge investments, push wearing masks (in France people locked homes mask wearing obligatory still fall now) work home, disinfecting wherever possible... results far impressive Spain death rate US, Belgium 50% higher per million said, clue guys US, Europe lot stuff either lock destroy business keep schools open risk cases. split lot small countries. sure could get much better results us matter did. trick achieving high test numbers worry turnaround time all! mean germany 80+ million doses flu shot available? 

In Italy obviously free, there's enough 60 million people, start people risk Japan. Testing widespread, anyone mild case gonna go right working travelling (and spreading it); miss work sick here. Ever. would love know got bubble. wait two weeks Christmas time start. doubt French much Christmas. bright side 7M confirmed per week! Murica First Yeah, like skinny dipping. get in, fine. need break North Safety half-face soon get stares, too.  Seeing 1 100 mask plenty. Maybe Swedish standard look countries. Well that's shit. 1% folks die (which I’m seeing average overall)...that’s 5,000 people, folks. That’s parents siblings neighbor next door. 

Please, whatever do, don’t let election one vote in. Let’s prevent next pandemic. cover exhaust valve. panic. 1489 covid patients ICU, 7.6k ICU beds free (low,high,ecmo), 12.7k beds emergency reserve (beds activated max 7days). control group age? Task Failed Successfully Funny Repubs want govt stay things comes telling people lives. Extrapolating current COVID mortality rate, 13,000 people likely survive. Wow. I’m surprised numbers keep growing. would known. 
/s happens put responsibilty ov public health average idiot? get pandemic that's what. fate sealed soon virus left China. alreddy late. lost soon began. We'll see things change another 2 years 1000 deaths day. Wow, covid actually kill people, underlying conditions, old age poor lifestyle choices thinking. That's hot take. Beats unpopular loser, think know I'm talking about, lol clear yet I'd bet ass anything closes gonna two weeks, assess situation reopen two weeks. planned think ive asked past, still don’t understand:

How unemployment run out?!

Surely keeps going, employed again? “It doesn’t mean people longer antibodies, doesn’t mean don’t protection.”

If test detect defective, them.

Antibodies crucial measure immunity. memory cells produce undetectable levels antibodies, still give strong immunity case infection?  Probably not, pronounce surname? Missing key point sports holiday.

Norway, Denmark, Malmö Gothenburg week 7-8. Stockholm area week 9. holiday traditional many Swedes go skiing abroad (think I've read close 1 million Swedes abroad week 9).

Hardest hit area Stockholm area.

Malmö restrictions Stockholm, days holiday Denmark, travels Kastrup (Denmark), handled pandemic better Denmark, atleast summer last checked.

Gothenburg I'm entirely sure about, took long time get sort spread, similar developments Oslo. think bad wait deal cascade automation spurred disease. 

With $5 trillion spent far, could funded 2 years worth $1,200/UBI Americans. (We could implemented VAT tax something sort circularly fund large portion progressively) 

Essential workers would seen incomes rise measure, risk workers could chosen prolong isolation, could gotten control virus sooner mitigated economic damage more. good thing Senate confirmed new SC justice adjourned weeks instead working kind stimulus bill. hospitals overflowing yet? Lol, another 1200 absolutely fuck people. sometimes say great wearing mask b/c authorities know am. give gangsta look back away too. Besides age groups, cases far numbers spring, even though look specifically graph cases, seems be. spring, number cases far levels importantly: done hospital/senior care staff, critically ill risk groups. lot get tested considerable risk. Everyone else symptoms told self-isolate looking numbers sick leave, vab movement, illogical assume number cases *much much* higher. see graph difference cases number tests positivity. people want see world burn. coming along saying sensible things counteracts hopes.  Oh ffs. think wear masks, wash hands, stand close people, still go work. work die. Considering China every country's travel list US not, half dozen country, including Canada, saying cases came US, looks like China that's diplomatic problems.

You paid much attention what's happening Taiwan recently think they're good time.. protector going flames, Beijing sending jets ""airspace"" daily basis and, thanks pandemic, economy almost completely depend mainland trade, Taiwan shafted pretty bad. deciding election affects every person equally, regardless location, location affect much vote worth? Still strange taking long. Oxford trial already COVID death, supposedly happened control group. would expect much infections considering recent spike cases. free. flew first class try maintain distance people. wear N95 regular surgical mask. Exactly. number undercounted 25%.

The real number close 300 000 now. possible end year Americans died COVID (directly indirectly) Americans died WWII. even viruses ignore curfews.  Vitamin super important. Expose daily 15min least face arms (the better :) ) means mouthwash manufacturers missing financial bonanza virus brought decided publish paper suggesting mouthwash helps reducing virus. would hate well. Life would literally become metro-boulot-dodo. Dumb fuck? 
You're right. slave nation like Hunger Games would much awesome place live. would super rad every election decided densely populated cities. I'm pretty sure meant contact tracing, tracking virus outside world shoes. understanding anyway. crappy situation round I'm sorry got virus, hope badly affected it. holy shit shut fuck Make sure vote early people, risk gets worse every day... good regional overview go [click look curves 21 regions.  
Uppsala plateaued Jämtland clearly way (which great, Jämtland limited hospital infrastructure due mostly mountains) great I've since March well reason dropped many users rarely tell what's happening!

They need dedicated team pushing what's happening advancements fields constantly would huge number users diseases. chance really advancing knowledge sorts like Cancer Parkinsons really short space time. Instead tell virtually nothing people lose interest. shame need second stimulus package, one actually focuses people businesses. know three best places America zombie apocalypse. Melbourne great job!

The one Victoria, Australia is.

The one Florida, USA much. see coming isnt US mate. Norway opens borders Sweden, everyone rushes cheap shopping like used pandemic, bunch people gather one place can, spread goes sides border, Norway closes borders, cases go down, rinse repeat. sometimes able feed kids worse.

I agree, sympathy folks. let's act like opening everything solution here. [This growing body research concluded steep drop economic activity last spring primarily result individual decisions consumers businesses rather legal mandates. People stopped going restaurants even governors ordered shut down. Airports emptied even though never significant restrictions domestic air States like Iowa reopened quickly initial pop employment sales. cautious states least partly closed gap, seen faster economic rebounds recent months many measures.

In order economy come back, need get virus control, least better control. need real relief package focuses people businesses. Exactly! job decades. accepts responsibility one main job mandates: pandemic preparedness. get behind fda approval Remdesivir, drug failed designed (hepatitis) failed ebola studies, sitting Gilead shelves? one lucky drug isn’t even effective saving lives Sars-COV-2 patients. Yet Fauci fan, even though aware other, promising antivirals pipeline. Gilead must $o grateful him. ""The Virus hoax"" must sustained November 3rd, regardless true loss life. promised going away. yeah let talk happen? nothing like last time? bad right now. see what's going france italy. couple weeks us politics still waiting till here... dumb *none extent 1984

Exactly places haven’t confirmed case yet hard say. share traits: sparsely populated, fairly remote.” low percent positive ton cases bad thing. Say 120k cases 1% positive? That’s good. Swedens health department fucking dumb. they’re still collecting unemployment minimum $400-$600 week, great higher minimum wage people work making before

These findings provide evidence variable waning antibody positivity time that, start second wave infection England, 4.4% adults detectable IgG antibodies using LFIA. Antibody positivity greater reported positive PCR lower older people asymptomatic infection. data suggest possibility decreasing population immunity increasing risk reinfection detectable antibodies decline population. assuming large sum people smart things planning strategy, maybe dumb.

Skåne = 212 death per million

The entirety Denmark = 122 death per million Idk sounds like pretty decent life lol Wtf, can’t Canada Oh it’s 27 stab wounds , straight Detroit become human 
Connor !!! Hi comrade, sure anti-vax backwards vibes. Since behaving pro-social, community minded way considered superiority complex? sounds like automatically assume everyone else selfish motives simply can’t fathom displaying altruism towards anyone.

Wearing masks actually make difference, psychopath. “those people” wearing masks also selfish, immature &amp; uneducated. Let's move positives leper colony. call Covider Colony. 3 weeks hospitalization exceeds previous waves? I'm sure Cockwomble is, assume dick injection could lead one. Uh what? Ease landlord nothing said.  
My argument home prices outpacing inflation easy asset use cash market soured. market. bought apple early 00s suffered covid crash, government buy losses? No. Real estate limited resource like anything else.  
And even point, market outpaces inflation is, definition barring entry people. also means entry point easier past would later on. your, ""if easy buy one yourself"" argument holds water either. Yes, especially since left wing guy Thuringa, Bodo Ramelow, already annouced upfront go lockdown. Federalism combined arrogance really bad mixture. 27 stab wounds !!! Sadly, people probably whole bunch torture lives already. reference 500k riyals equals 135k dollars rural America, stupid ""MUH FREEDOM""-loving alt-reichers colliding civilization, reason, logic decency. 

There nothing like pandemic really pull curtain nasty sewage-drinking **sub**culture Chi town predictable could avoided. true! “Sister Suffergate”should name mom code group people refuse comply mitigation measures making hard to. Society: ""See ya never"" 

People like deserve locked safety public. wrong world. Seriously.  South Korea Vietnam may well be. Yes, technically North Korea borders South Korea way cross border. Vietnam surrounded mountains. Yes, Minnisota. Hahaha! That’s awesome. Yes last term thats 3 included treatment protocols (early stage) Here's charts curves look good. say white person following black /s Uhhh, still  Nobody helped lad sounds it. Stupid bitches. Wtf? Youre badly misinterpreting results. Frequenting bars restaurants significantly increases likelihood contracting Covid multiple times likely report dining restaurant (aOR = 2.8, 95% CI = 1.9–4.3) going bar/coffee shop (aOR = 3.9, 95% CI = 1.5–10.1) control-participants. could be? appear account major aggregate percentage spread they've closed many places people avoiding en masse. say stats OP noted evidence effectiveness people going bars restaurants. problem skeptic arguments anti-public health disinformation general. identify area that's successfully mitigated say, ""Look, rules never needed!"" reason appear unneeded successful first place. ""It's mandated get tested, that's thing,"" said. ""And need remember choice need make decisions based feel.""

How reporter resist saying ""Fuck feelings!""? exactly I'm talking about.

History look (and quite possibly written by) large areas East Asia, rich poor, absolutely uncompromising approach dealing pandemic. Though situations, terms wealth, locality, society size differ greatly, one thing common. fought virus, - won.

The greatest tragedy (and think alluding to) befallen places poor weakly governed fight, even lockdowns, even measures. West could shown example, could crushed virus spread there, could ready give every support, secured situation. not. thought we'd done Covid, went holiday. Yeah, luckily people ignorant knives good humanity. 

Edit: Cane across insensitive critique knife skills. support stabbing people, I’m annoyingly pedantic. Hoping security guard heals quickly. people have, easier literally one lives NZ works anywhere else. 

Think EU borders. know 30 people live France work Switzerland. US states...

EDIT: Read comment below. clear cut thought. I'd say, people look way pandemic held bak April government doing. Even though told stay home saw cases like Premiere Morawiecki going thr cinema without mask, PiS leader - Kaczyński - going cemetery 10th anniversary Smolensk catastrophy, alone, group 10-15 people, told gatherings 5 people forbidden.

Then elections, Morawiecki saying virus scary anymore encouraging vote (especially seniors!!!), situation restaurants, family could eat seating table. Morawiecki spotted colleagues gov place, regulations dining changed. Poland didnt many cases back then, people tendency thinking ""I know anyone it, you?"". Restrictions lifted order save economy, okay. since then, government done pretty much anything prepare country second wave. 

So multiple important politicians stupid shit like wrote above, time ordering people that, wear mask, even don't, keep distance don't, we've ministry health lider saying doesnt wear mask doesnt show symptoms, says must follow rules, go vacation trips etc spotted abroad, enjoying time. 

People got angry, upset, sad could treat way do. Also hard acknowledge fact losing control lives, see worldwide conspiracy thing push blame on. Also current situation country terrible, lots protests, surely lead infections, I'm scared think happen next. fucking hate this. Trump's wrong Covid-19.


No wonder FAUX News opinion spewers sheeple think experts wrong.


T-Rump person listen to. defense lawyer's job come *something*. duty bound try best defend represent. went ""Welp, clearly murderers, lock em life"" would result mistrial.

And prosecutor's job justify whatever charges press, can't withstand defense claiming charges wrong bad charges.  really got stop testing want go away :) ""Did feel anger? Hate?"" people need stay fuck home mind business elephant room ignored. Haha, surprises. well, well, well. time, another family group dinner restaurant. 4 tested positive. health authority investigating relation two Karens....

ETA. Apparently 2. predicting inflation now? often fed reached inflation target since 2000?

This unprecedented. years 2008 same. Bonds safe even low interest rates. ah nice.. sounds like lot better US respect (and everything else) Alberta beautiful. nice time visiting 15 years ago.

Most Alberta government news sources concerning mask mandates dated around 29th-31st July 2020 that's assuming mask mandate introduced. page gives graph Covid cases clearly see steep increase cases end July immediately introduction mask mandate. Immediately following mask mandate Covid cases fairly falt two months. So, no, cases climb like crazy immediately mask mandate introduced.

There huge increase start October though - two months mask mandate. change policy around time? instance, Alberta reopen schools September/October? take don’t want US help take 100,000 iu vit.d month last 3. prescribed 12months worth.

I havent got ""plan"" per se, foreshadow potentially going 1000iu tablet day 6months ""over every winter"". 9 months (despite 12m prescription). think, assuming ""the rules"" A-OK, that's feature society since forever. announced they’d given up? point, cross crime humanity? People really trashing curfew good idea. Cut cost much cut : Social party. cut education work, important economy.

Now fails, multiple reason greatest ""It enough gov help, enforce work home"" also people dodging curfew. 9PM really late, people go friend's house spend night here, put social event earlier.

In short, *it worth shot*, bad done poorly. lockdown seem rather dull, since obviously stop virus, slow since herd immunity can't achieve, ? Lockdown every 3 months ? I'd love it, that's society works. Lockdown meant earn time solution found. almost year.

But guess better nothing like countries do. really enjoyed Ravenna Italy, Krakow Budapest. hoping travel Spain Croatia year, covid happened. realize unfair compare places vacation vs live. Paris high points, also lot low points often hard look past daily basis.  states don’t know stop New York

lolololol maybe lacks magnesium?  We're stage moment.  wife ex talk wants every weekend resume think safe all. open communication might different, talking putting people risk court ordered document.  frustrating. wish super clear write interviews. fact aren’t worries they’ll try keep restrictions place longer ... lack magnesium? Come on. know answer. Doom gloom wins. Coming today 7-day running average 122, 50% increase ~three days ago represents. recent average growth: 7-day running average doubling every week.

The question stop rising pace. herd immunity reached speed could end coasting past point high prevalence. FWIW here's latest charts Texas, running 7-day data available, Texas 62.99 deaths per 100k ~600 cases island now, I'm really interested seeing changes coming weeks idea, travelled 10 years. moved show vaccinations since birth go consulate get vaccinations entering (I know every VISA applicant I've never travelled China anything resident). 

They also let dad checked ""yes"" every ""are terrorist"", ""have commited crimes humanity"" questions error, though... Fun fact.

They're usually kidding shit, would guess negative test quarantine. tell sure. Yeah, understand people deserve legal representation speedy trial, WTAF ? lawyer doesn’t need douche say overcharged? must know many times stab someone it’s seen crime ? Like shit toilet bowl. hey, get say something?

Are black people good white people? smart? good? terms violent? get treatment cops?

Because looking comment history, know would say that. ~600 cases island now, I'm really interested seeing changes coming weeks Well, least living horrific burden cloth touching face. same. things heating March April, gun flashed go store work scrubs. People freaking nuts. Jokes them, lot places COVID testing test adults requires stock multiple (e.g. child infant) sizes nasal swabs. Yet another sign America still bad testing. sorry Colorado. Right I'm miserable FL, got 7% today action gov. even ""Oh."" havent seen discovered covid lowers vit C levels +1 shirt text

I get I'm old must’ve Trump’s fault. Trump said masks helpful didn’t say loud enough people confused do. confusion, stabbing natural. think vaccine start rolling general public? antisocial psychopaths, according science. specific rural areas, according US seven day average higher ever been. line graph heading steeply up. can't compare situation today beginning. Experts know much gave educated guesses. Masks also available back then, even medical personnel they're still part solution. 

Now large chunk scientific community occupied research Covid19. groundbreaking changes anymore. Australia even made mandatory ""anyone work home so"" lot bosses said impossible, eventually given choice WFH shutting entirely suddenly possible. Prosecutor offer plea deal aggravated assault, life possibility parole. 5 new confirmed cases Hong Kong.

All 22 domestic cases conversions asymptomatic carriers Kashgar. That's actually good sign, means outbreak caught early stages, pattern Dalian Qingdao like Urumqi.

Ratio Dalian 14 asymptomatic carriers, eventually 11 started show symptoms became confirmed cases.

In Dalian, first generation infected two dock workers infected handling frozen fish. promptly discovered periodic PCR test (every two weeks people working high risk professions) hospitalised.

At chest hospital, two infected 12 people due improper procedure leading share CT room non-COVID-19 patients. One 12 discovered PCR testing returned hospital another round treatment tuberculosis, rule China get PCR tested COVID-19 need hospitalised reason. lead city wide testing discovered 11 infected second generation. 12 2nd generation close links chest hospital one else city tested positive gave high confidence spread event hospital community spread yet occurred.

In case Kashgar, full scale testing nearly done every case discovered asymptomatic stage. suggests nearly either 2nd 3rd generation cases, 22 confirmed cases yesterday likely 2nd generation. may 180 far actually 2nd generation cases single superspreading event, otherwise there's 4 generations slow spread would expect testing discovered confirmed cases already instead exclusively asymptomatic carriers.

The Kashgar index case (the 17 year old girl clothing factory) also discovered routine periodical PCR testing, highlighting important regular testing population finding outbreak early stages.

The earlier asymptomatic carrier Guangdong (the guy worked quarantine hotel) also discovered via routine periodical PCR testing considered engaging high risk profession. sacrificing teachers lives. bigger, right?  please send word Donny? heroes wear capes wear masks share stuff like this. Thank you. judge ask specific number stabs charges right.

This lawyer disbarred stupid claim. people talk say fish oil. thoughts? boo boo. ""Didn't want give chance, huh?"" people America trying to, rest aren’t! Hmm, sounds like someone deserves fair bit torture return. Eye eye all. 🖤

Lol downvote want, defend scumbag line too. guys want take away Christmas! People dumb lol God works mysterious ways.  Bad leadership top, many states.

About 30% population trained distrust science. taking kids public school children might get exposed evidence biological evolution climate science. Others can't distinguish evidence anti-vax charlatans.

Business interests understand long term interests would best served serious travel restrictions (eg, mandatory 14 day quarantines arrivals). understand *effective* lockdown fastest path economic recovery. Maybe airlines use old 1970s floor bolt patterns bring seating comfortable safer distance? Right? Looks like Thailand. acting animalistic instinct rather able think situation. hate say believe gotten bad. He’s still running subway trains, right? going require test? Roasted!!!! Bit hard you’re legal gray areas like that, comes business you’ve going limits enforced generally followed. lot people don’t really anything throw drain first place can't control actions crazy violent person. thing prepare worst. always ways become prepared. done Israel.

Note closed schools. Sounds like employers providing this... along hazard pay. 1. China aggressive contact tracing, either cellphone based locating publicly announcing names, addresses movements new domestic cases close contacts identified, tested isolated. Western privacy laws prevent that.
2. China mass testing using batch technology, pool samples lot people run test together, re-test batch positive. efficient test millions mere days, China tested 5 6 cities far way, problem technology works case numbers really really low. need hard lockdown aggressive contact tracing program get there. I'm sorry speak Italian start living virus responsibly ,we can't stay closed forever, thats economically mentally viable. governments across world keen idea second lockdowns levels first ones. covid stats flat important things open bit. Although agree certain things completely opened, like sports games large gathering events,they shouldnt opened 100% capacity. even though disagree mask mandate, dont think wise decision remove right now. even point contact tracing community transmission rampant. certainly threshold solution community wide quarantines, ie lockdown. 

Not lockdowns solution. even contact tracing possible porous borders EU (unless restrict Schengen). version Mag recommend? Well, acknowledge explanation blatantly inappropriate survey question (in reasonably connected stated objective) logically unsound conclusion: they’re genuinely stupid. Better treatments. Better protections vulnerable people. social distancing mask use reduces viral load people get infected. 

If exposed virus particles greater chance infection gets lungs starts havoc. exposed fewer particles, infection contained upper respiratory tract. 

This many people today get Covid don’t need hospitalization, restrictions meant exposed fewer particles. 

Put way: Without social distancing restrictions masks, percentage serious outcomes would closer saw March April. imagine bad would hospitals. bit lucky early virus hadn’t spread far wide yet. 

Covid hasn’t changed. want crowded indoor space hours without mask poor ventilation. earth talking about? Yeah overflowing hospitals definitely look completely different November. There'll Christmas trees reception!

I think dude (and others) picture patients lying dead floor, doctors nurses, heads hands, crying screaming hallways, body bags bursting overflowing morgue drawers, bloody hands pressed chained shut main entrance doors. reality rows beds fully occupied catatonic people, tired harassed doctors saying ""we're beds staff can't treat anyone else, people dying home"". words looks much like photo hospital. great visual impact he's yearning for.

I mean refrigerated trucks scare shit you, will? packed waiting room couple hundred people max, statistically translate 2 3 dead even COVID.

Better question is, dont get see whats like hospitals places hundred die day. remember first week March someone shared article saying scientists already working vaccine bunch people immediately declared nothing worry definitely shutdown vaccine almost here. Thanks much insight! 

Seems like gov (and companies) got things right. 

Thanks enjoy lasts! things avoid hurt victim-blaming. good practice. graveyard filled people right way. People wear masks private gatherings anti-maskers.

This mask mandates work. need country that's willing voluntarily wear masks times (aside direct family live with). See: Japan.  world admittedly come long way mental health awarness. shit, people fucking clue Bipolar disorder actually is.

Its unfortunate. want see world China described Western media dominant superpower. Fortunately version exist.  Fair enough, makes sense. 367 people died within 24 hours other, within 24 hours infection. seems pretty obvious. I'd send regrets.

&amp; Masks. think implying it, invest several hundred dollars keep safe. anyone ""Store guards wearing full plate armor deal crazy nomasker"" November ? need Federal Aid.  www.natethesnake.com u That's accurate, cases grew one state Australia particular one city, major cities Australia kept virus well suppressed right winter light restrictions. I've cut one blue paper masks give away big box stores put piece vent respirator rubber band. covers vent without blocking making exhale difficult. get respirator filters unmasked mouthbreather's mouth mist also spraying collection lung fauna anyone else. 

Win:Win guys know travelled Australia either stayed Australia since March quit job mean time. guys working Africa Indonesia etc subject 2 weeks quarantine every time arrive back country. double shifts whatever country get double time off. companies work pay still 2 weeks locked hotel. think mad! money makes work guess.  mind vaccines proven track record ton use, family get flu shots every year, kids given vaccines age first available. believe vaccines required public schooling.

However, vaccine type virus [we've never made [record [tons get [tons stake, sound like combination safety efficacy.

Note: care released Trump ever. still applies. show examples care manufacturer drug lying about, simply knowing, negative effects drug.

Depending vaccine itself, trials through, amount time bodies, efficacy; might squeamish. right though, family good, I'll let others part wider ""test"" group released. We'll stay home, order-in, get groceries pickup, invite people over, home school work, social distance, wear masks wise out.  attends parties? recommend reading part ""mathematical model"" presented govt start first wave - simple Excel table could made high schooler - persuaded govt lockdown needed. criticizing lockdown I'd expect govt would experts sophisticated models. shows clearly incompetent govt is. People catch love 🤣 could watch video, maybe shows that. kind thing refuse watch. base entire argument around wording evidence supporting you. know point **you** must know isn't. What's point conversation? I'll say again, **any** law protects people anti-mask based hiring discrimination. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner. Bye troll. can't give stats, call bullshit. 

(And yes, dispensary, hence say full shit.) 

Don't bother replying unless got stats. Otherwise, harassment.  going very, interesting Dec-Feb time frame see reinfections start happen China. Honestly - I’m total asshole wear mask - mostly polite.  “The White House’s science policy office today ranked “ending Covid-19 pandemic” atop list Donald Trump’s top first-term accomplishments, even country registers record amounts infections hospitals fill again” get Well airlines giving flight credits flights book least beginning next year. appalling someone fraudulently take advantage PPP federal stimulus/relief, don’t let discourage us providing much-needed pandemic relief suffering families small businesses. need make sure better oversight. mask right now, spare car. oh. teachers. staff, secretaries, custodial staff, bus drivers, administrators, parents, extended families...kids covid 19 fucking issue. spokesman Ian Fury noted governor oppose mask-wearing, **trying promote “nuanced” approach masks**. said appropriate wear masks around people symptoms COVID-19 hospitals. encouraged people wear face coverings public, recommended CDC.

Username checks out. media narrative Sweden's approach worked? Everything I've seen said opposite.

When saw headline really expected article tried argue favor Sweden's approach. Denmark yesterday 1000 cases half swedens population? **Don't exaggerate buddy. consequences playing Batman real life.** average 5 days. Surely better uses testing capacity. Yeah here, among social sphere people least dramatic whole thing doctor nurse friends. Sure Jan Oh got wrong, Day 1, cutting travel China xenophobic, Democratic hoax indeed. oNe sToP WeArInG mAsKs, FrEeDoM cHoOsE wEaR MaSk supposed use fabric comes masks?

Regardless would done way better job. Daily tested peaks - July/October 875,000/1,275,000

Hospital workers bother get flu vaccine every year sloppy therefor less likely wear proper PPE. seen TON idiot hospital employees think immune system tough nails wear PPE.

Them getting covid mean flu vaccine protecting damn thing besides flu. also force masks people unlikely conscientous using correctly. 

And probably lead littering, might add. ONS figures take longer compile (they're usually published two weeks date) since takes death certificates registered processed properly. Since people always want ""instant"" figure, media organisations report daily DHSC one. worst worlds Unemployment ran *months* ago people. Going go hell this, but... they’ve got point. take even care passing someone mask now, since official recommendation either think worried, symtoms might risk group. look avoid (which everyone), mean judge give thought that. everyone one I'm sure would behave - basically argument. behavior, masks stops droplets.

Also **feeling** alienated strange since know something different therefore self conscious it, probably even true Sweden want's fit in. walked around ketchup white shirt, would think everyone looked you.

That said, think mask mandate least public transport, since basic need big cities function often impossible avoid crowds rush hours. Norway Finland high population density areas comparable Stockholm (or Copenhagen). Lots Aussies roots UK, I'm one I'm worried things there.
It's looking might past point return, really hope I'm mistaken. Still less countries Europe per capita. Fricking Bloomberg. tell first-hand, lot Melbournians hurting, easy many, last thing people feeling right 'bleak'. economy would hunky-dory we'd let virus run rampant. It’s always white collar. server bartender, furloughed entire time. think anything prevent spreading virus good thing, means less lives lost. I’d rather shitty beans rice seasoned Taco Bell packets life take part anything could contribute someone’s death. think that's national debts work, generally agree rest position. Penis dunno maybe, food, doctor visits, people lack empathy can't follow even simple instructions mitigate spread? Yeah Sweden lots medical equipment stuck France.

And keep talking ass, talk like know 100% fact don’t even k ow half it. 

Tegnell isn’t dictator, he’s one communicating press mostly. going scientific approach, evil lmao, really got laughing there.

Sweden much bigger part population Iran, Italy Astoria pandemic broke out. look southern Sweden spring break 1-2 weeks earlier, dodged outbreak therefore cases low now. 

You really can’t tell strategies Norway working differences strategies. can’t even tell differences lol. Meanwhile people echo chamber called reddit upvotes comment. Jesus Christ, really makes question waste time site much dumbed discussed morons ""Rounding Curve"" Victoria lockdown enforced egregious human rights violations:

Let everyone see want.** username fron radiohead song? see saying. masks rather long term strategy - measures vs fatigue. cases start growing rapidly (sadly, likely happen soon) able mandate masks people happy use couple months ( toll vacations available mid 2021) without complaining. actually started making sense me. Number one? guess raw numbers absolutely meaningless.

Per capita even top 10.

We equivalent 500k cases day Czech Republic. (15k cases day population 10 mil) Lol, understand they’re saying? really use little deductive reasoning figure 280,000,000 1% world’s population?  Elementary Schools mostly masks hallway / courtyard class rooms. older children class, too. concept is: ventilating everything handled class-level (no children contacts outside class). feel like even though taken every precaution well isolated since February going heavy isolation depression even introvert I'm still going end catching one else gives fuck. opposite happened Seoul. Everyone subway defended guy confronted anti-masker. stopped train. got thrown train arrested police. Dude. Find someone hug. clearly need it. roof closed. Nope, rolled headline likely LOT that. Clearly understand math large numbers. Please better. seem heard Koreans talk other. Interesting! know Dr Fauci supplements Vit C D. wonder prophylactically? general immune support? 11 beds, 90.9% capacity 10 people occupying beds, 100% capacity 11 people occupying beds. putting multiple people beds get 99% number??

""Please sir rest leg here, rest floor fit person's arm last bed."" Also, think pretty short-sighted rely number empty ICU beds. People forget patients need critical care reasons Covid-19, too. 100% willing bet shit florida. lying. practice round inject stuff appear something 😷 Well jumped plane survived hit ground once. guys even top 10 go per capita statistics (the ones actually mean something).

We equivalent 500k cases **per day** Czech Republic Yes Sadiq Khan, keep preaching Londoners ""doing right thing"", tell lot clearly not! Yep flawed systems round Sturgis, Whitehouse, nursing homes.... Countries catching Swedens deaths per million. Look like France take tired winning yet? tried Sapporo? super nice Let's forget running water shitting 3GD. Yeah CZ well first round. course. meant say we'd locked everything (outside perhaps food emergency services) boat like month, govt subsidy rent-freeze, probably could nailed thing pretty well (some countries manage that, least time). now, know anymore. probably requires country-wide effort, coordinated worldwide effort, everything I've seen come people this, think humans damn selfish scared ever pull anything like off. Sweden's communities lot smaller isolated, fortify vitamin food begin with, society thinks collectively gives shit other. lockdown. new *recommendations*. actually enforced. Easy dismiss everything agree opinion bot.

The US exact thing. Americans like accuse Russia meddling elections US like half countries world destabilizing whole Middle-East countries South-America, let's forget that

As example, American ambassador Netherlands (where I'm from) even publicly supporting far-right party (while ambassadors supposed meddle politics), spreading fake news cars burned (which happen) no-go zones Dutch cities (which exist). wants bunch people stay locked home two weeks go thanksgiving gathering? much reason declare BANKRUPTCY! UK Orwellian Partial lockdowns worked anywhere UK. Months on, Leicester still lockdown. Manchester. next months, we'll see Liverpool, Warrington, Nottingham etc. 

Partial lockdowns clearly work. Lockdown hard early limited time. impression got likely legitimate deal kept table avoid upsetting Americans. saying then? zap brannigan approach it? Excellent. Naw, I'm tainted lot. Thanks making America ""Great again"" again. look Wisconsin makes sense. Tavern League (among groups) forefront battle virus. 

Sued open wisconsin back up, sued mask mandate, sued remove limitations public gatherings larger 25%of capacity. 

Once get Milwaukee Madison, find mask usage Even places hospitals near capacity. ridiculous I'm glad need leave apt every 2 weeks go shopping. Wait till winter gets here. 1M week easily. Hell, 1.5M might reachable. sub goldmine submissions Daily Dumbest Comment! responsibility talking about?. get bus nobody wears face go life carries normal!.

Why treating responsible rest real world behave exactly like rest us?. Ok... eradicated course going spike cases whenever open up. one said would vanish can't enforce drug laws yet drugs remain illegal despite legalization offering many immediate benefits. Please, please, mistake whole world back february/march: ""Oh Italy, dumb, would NEVER EVER happen organized smart country"". happen way, sooner rather later. there's way try shut total lockdown.  Cope Melbourne would like word m8, hell according google Australia's lockdowns allowed us go last 8 days without single death. 

As ""wa wa easier island"", true. letting nearly 1000 people die day without serious effort stop disgusting. Interestingly restrictions harsher Norway since opened up. Though surging numbers new restrictions that's longer case think.

you saw crisis actor, dude read study. conclusion Well that’s good we'll see elsewhere, full lockdown tackle surge. Thank you.  can't say enough bad shot response better start spreading disinformation. causing massive crowding trains home work. remain empty many cases. roughly half million homeless people US 17 million vacant homes. contact works DOH there. She’s included lot email chains regarding covid data despite anything herself. Earlier week told Florida delaying data 2 deaths 30. I’m guessing also something it. Look, get seeing family. we've seen time that:

1.	Nobody lives bubble. ""informed"" decisions affect them, unless strictly adhering quarantining isolation.
2.	A significant proportion population adhering guidelines.
3.	People spread without knowing. they're ignoring fact, still making ""informed"" decision?
4.	People suck math. Case point utterly meaningless 99.99% survival rate assertion above. places case fatality rate seems around 1%, idea mixed basic stat. way 15%. reference, polio, pretty well known, serious symptom rate 0.5%, 15-30% adults 2-5% kids die. Less fatal COVID, yet something taken extremely seriously something remember decades after.
5.	People suck risk management. would drive car 1% chance dying per trip. long dead, cars would abandoned society.

So, yeah, trust ""adults"". know they're talking about.  Sure quite stable like 1 month. SAUERKRAUT! embarrassed slightest failing poke holes retarded logic don’t understand I’m talking shout

Fixed ya, friend! sure glad able assist much journey learning today. required nonessential businesses close indoor operations beginning 8 p.m. Tuesday. Salons may open appointment only. Hmm, say would eradicated? vanish?

No.

You did. Cult individuality. Again, I’m sharing opinion. conclusion study. soldiers, still deserting time combat normally frowned upon, even though usually free leave professional military point then. sure Turkish education system works, live use tax money pay training doctors, pay millions train one, expect work needed most. realize hard reconcile ""they slaves"", need use tools disposal. Thats true.

If people follow guidelines, ie continue eating restaurants, continue working office, continue going classrooms even multiple students class virus, disease keeps spreading problem guidelines.

Polls showed people France willing lockdown time now. cant lockdown go work, etc. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article 10 years. math off.

100k x 365 = 36.5M. US population 330M. superiority complex undermined ones unable look eye. say hate Trump gtfo. They’ll take open arms. Enjoy! missed zeros. We’ll take hands don’t want him. Australia could definitely benefit presence government.  truly believes that, that's fantastic argument socializing/nationalizing healthcare removing profit equation.

Turning vertical line Couldnt happen worse country embarrassed slightest poking holes retarded logic. wasnt looking comparison across two countries. asking happens governments go broke.

I work United States smaller governments (cities, counties, etc).

They freaking right cash flow issues solvency due COVID Coming next monday Germany 4 week lockdown gastronomy (except delivery takeaway), everything sports related (so gyms etc), entertainment industry (cinemas etc), tattoostudios like getting closed. retail open, 1 person per 25 square meters allowed inside ah yes lockdwn still pint long comes meal. effective I'm Belgian, lockdown stop virus make slower spread... problem also kills small businesses. bankrupcies numerous point small business unions suing government stay open. politicians want ones taking decision lock us would get re-elected ever again. 
They half-ass measures like curfews, like sport people 12 years old on. anyone curious graphs would look included Denmark too:

I’m thinking south park episode keep saying shit see site. Must removed. mean... evidence suggest even lockdown somehow virus could eradicated US. always essential workers etc. holdouts infections. think little silly say everyone locked virus would vanish, like miracle. Sweden 1870 cases day like week ago. Well, first off, that's terrible terrible mean question asked, know, see, called, ""we're different countries"" alright? That's is, he's made decision due situation country need here, we're great. gonna great, watch. Right...so people getting better, media whack loads misinformation spinning never ending doubt fear stream info says nothing.

After endured thing, recovered, noting scarring left behind impact had, hear ""Oh...you catch again"" pure bullshit.

Makes wonder 'contract' second time actually recover first time? matter said individuals underlying condition, see driving mortality rates...because I'll admit weaker I'd quite dead now.

Where, might ask, would one restrict information purely credible source? Non-american please...with deep psychosis full swing study taken boulders salt. Yes, see point. Obama choosing qualified people positions military service good credential another long list reasons good president. Hah... theory that's Arizona bad June/July cases spiking much rest nation now. hot anything outdoors everyone gathering indoors. nice gatherings outdoors again. daily cases zero, everyone it. Thats assumption. Another possibility that, current political climate, asking certain types people wear mask similar asking football hooligan wear teams shirt. 27 precise didn’t see coming fall moving winter. Problem is, weren’t able separate causation correlation. So, deficient getting Covid Covid cause become deficient? aren’t likely know time soon. Everyone would need recent blood test showing Vit levels infection hospital admission. like Charlie Sheen levels winning - remembering HIV “winning” hard wearing protection. flu shots mandatory least Bush's flight deck photo op could least argue whole point combat operations mission accomplished (while ignoring occupation completely bungled). Trump flat bizarro world ignoring everything, simply hoping gaslight voters support him. wife joked back said actually concerned could get garden sprayer bleach mixture spray stuff garage actually considered it.

Now we're attending family gatherings apparently kids spitting birthday cake blowing candles wearing mask past forever scientifically proven 100% spread anything ever.

Fuck shit. Everyone needs get heads asses. Thanks sorry working getting rid giant orange buttfuck... I've locked since March well. Fuck selfish assholes. 😥 doesn’t.

But would love hear r/enlightenedcentrism usually tell “then that’s another major flaw capitalism” bring reason sub. work way, exactly I'm pointing out. know something (X) something (Y) something (Z), isolated even visualized X begin with?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Ah, British exceptionalism; exceptional assholery. Porch? country area talking here? curious never seen porch standard feature apartment live. Typically that's something home owners around here, even usually like nice homes Looking worldometers.info seems like Sweden bad spring still many times worse overall Denmark, reading right?

Per week? Shit that's ridiculously low country size. going number active cases listed worldometers Far strictest, since DK increased restrictions. Another possible similarity CFS/ME really get exposed needles get flu need hospitalization....... America never meant last long, especially thrives exploitation countries.  bad want contain virus surge? Wtf matter you? dont mean agree, makes absolutely sense completely irresponsible. boyfriends coworkers case didn’t want miss work guess though exposed didn’t think actually wanted confirm that. Still stupid, everyone pissed. shut entire place cleaning paid everyone else worked guy get tested, one else tested positive thankfully. It's

1) Corona

2) ???

3) Damages multiple organs

&amp;#x200B;

Currently researching ""???"", e.g. smelling, found nerve cells helper cells produce nutrients, helper cells damaged. nerve cells pure nutrients, virus nothing.

I read creating mini-lungs human tissue observing single virus infects destroys cell (other kinds virus need several virus bodies take control), damage mini-lungs die differently lungs human do.  Self imposed..... established half country undereducated people selfish boot. people reason still fighting level are, reason many people lost jobs, reason half deaths occurred. point zero faith occur. I'd better luck walking around lamp looking honest man. Well undefined country could saved us committed ultimate act sacrifice guess humans equal selfish pieces shit matter Lot people area opposite what's recommended. eat every day, many gatherings.  crazy People aren’t getting financial support. people haven’t worked 7 months. going WHATEVER TAKES make money survive. see news articles stating cases rise whatever vaccine deemed appropriate. articles designed incite fear and
maintain control. people understanding that, regardless party politics, government cannot solve problem people need make decisions based calculated risk. 

Keep sacrificing 15 million service/ production employees small businesses hope vaccine. quality life US economy. voluntarily sacrificing invisible enemy, covid, largely without question.

Trading liberties “perceived safety” doesn’t seem like fair deal. always said, second wave would worse, always wondered why? know, people DGAF. Oh man, even ""bad"" pandemic, compare something like spanish flu, still managed F\* up. wonder learn this, boy, much learn that, don´t mean medical stuff. Social behavior, Fake News, Economics.. enough material lot PHDs many different fields. Thank part So, china. They're like 1-2 cases daily, they've back basically normal life many months now.

Their lockdown probably strict country. Say freedoms, they're country handle thing logically reaping benefits. 

As rest world, china probably beyond reach, variety reasons. many states countries maintained covid low levels long time anyway, lockdowns good social behavior.

If could keep levels low enough vaccine, could save hundreds thousands lives. numbers trending, we'll lose another 100k+ us January. half would totally preventable american lives priority government. pretended war started living normal lives large amounts virus still circulating, big mistake Hey least admit it. Yes, don't. 100% could, don't, that's key distinction. 1984 literally everyone 100% time. much, difference. immune system like, “Up yours, dickwad, I’m cleaning messes. put mask, nooooo...” Yeah, *that's* about. person bitter invited Halloween party.

Jesus fucking Christ... disagreeing ""slip slop slap"" happen effect melanoma rates impact Australian's feel public health advice? I'd he's stuff her...like butt stuff. 
China hadnt played. knew. govts knew. societied chose care arrogance. ample tome prepare Dec 31st on. many people living stay home day temperatures drop freezing. people actually sick “pandemic” We’re six months in. Plus unlike anti maskers, much likely infected that's wear store. I'd still keep back anyway. mask far preferable cheap disposable worn incorrectly. Normally travel internationally see elderly mother. 6 months ago started saying might able get (to mentally prepare see me). 

About 4 months ago said definitely Christmas. 

Anticipation &amp; building hope, dashing last moment makes worse think. 5 years after? Doubt much. Yeah sucks. know what's worse fatigued quarantine though? Permanently losing lung function potentially dying (after possibly infecting loved ones) preventable disease. Still, fucked either way vaccine without one seems I'm ct see lots masks usually. NH masks never did! this, prepared Freedom Tantrums Rugged Individualism reply. :,) actually know something who's ballot. 150k tests per week, positivity around 3-4 % ρ(t) = ρ_0 * e^(αt) filter put inside masks Nah, logical conclusion Asia right something, right decades something better US. That’s impossible, therefore connection masks controlling infection. Midwest overran Trump supporting covid deniers, Oklahoma I’ve heard “covid myth” times care admit. Deaths lagginf indicator www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/health/coronavirus-reinfection.amp.html

I take chances this. social distanced 8 months tired. caught I’m ready get again. COVID, they're lying imagine shuts people they're asked put mask. Well yeah best chusetts Ed's everyone see always wearing mask. sure say New Hampshire though, second lowest amount cases nation least district one member like that. Mine entirely comprised members opinion.

Get involved local politics. Vote school board, vote city council. throwing 1870 room much much worse Denmark. 

No not. started number brute number, add comments.

You contradicting statements never put forward, weird. meant ""We've all"", finland too. swear people root pandemic get worse purely political stance. Wow, might work! ten friends, could get magical unicorn. also tests done ever before? MAP RED mean, happened caravan illegal immigrants marching border. /s name offensive worries utter failure tackling COVID it’s pretty firm indication society failing test we’ll ever capable tackling bigger issues like global warming.

It's one things make quite cynical short-sightedness democracy, rather democracy information age. Democracy healthy educated population, social media lies misinformation spread faster truth, see functioning well long anywhere.

Ironically, democracy relies open information available, somehow scale properly technology. way hole aim control information, words censorship - opposite democracy stands for. know... fucking hate it.

And Nov 4th comes around, people moved new talking point completely forgotten claiming months (and likely voted accordingly) hoax going go away election. base sense responsibility claim on? live see it. Polio vaccine limited infection guy could still get virus, measels smallpox give lifelong immunity natural infections. I’m sorry mother idiot. Sounds like aren’t though that’s good Viruses ""merge"" Pa. (AP) — growing majority people contracting coronavirus Pennsylvania answering basic questions would help case investigators trace source infections, Pennsylvania health officials said Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said news conference **71% people interviewed week Oct. 11-17 completely answer [contact tracing] questions** whether frequented business attended mass gathering 14 days symptoms showed up. Foul cheese capes! suppress numbers til election throwing 1870 room much much worse Denmark. look graph see similar 7-day per capita incidence. TWIV name podcast. Yes abbreviation Week Virology, abbreviation name. dumb fuck electorate bigger problem college. Shape matters lol

And testing. Last checked Sweden tested less lowest us state. improved? less control late spring US absolutely NOTHING contain virus. hope contain people instead, far longer. can't imagine we'll weather thing without leadership. Uber eats? Dude use something safer. Salt, alcohol can. Wear mask. Stay away people. Disinfect hands (a lot). eat out. go pubs. Quit partying ass weekends.

Send message 10 friends tell receive magical internet unicorn points send message 10 friends. 

Repeat, needed. People die needlessly communist regimes 🙄 Well, agree they’re worth fighting for, I’d prefer people fight peaceful, less damaging way. point find laughable think one hand extremely precise reporting system traces back covid death communicated 5 months ago removes technically death happened 30 days swab.
On hand get 4 days total silence (fri sat sun mon) every week numbers ""do justify that"".

This addition reports performed way country does, precision day test vs reporting apparently important (because day positive test equal day infection, neither delay infection test measurable expecially asymptomatic) turns whole ""daily"" curve complete, useless nonsense.

They playing way numbers since beginning claiming accuracy. confusion, accuracy. reason none else pretty obvious. former. steroid use started damage already occurred. 21-year-old person might heal matter weeks months. 73, damage may take lot longer repair. Ok, even true (i, ts not) , youre first post still wrong. like ""works"" works could still get infected taking it. one mentions first gen vaccines almost worthless restrictions continue God knows long even approved Thank answering. English...you expressed clearly, that's matters.  atleast America, people refuse wear masks take precautions thinking themselves. Congrats, (500k/330 millions) 660 weeks like one go achieved herd immunity! Um no. Trump probably hoping doesn’t win doesn’t deal Covid Covid Covid. He’ll leave mess Joe clean part Stockholm in? also Stockholm gone handful times to, barely see anyone wearing mask here. Republicans fascism thousands people would undergo years medical training, like work cash register something 20-30 years waiting next pandemic hit? quarantine March 321638496030th Next read Brave New World. Except know, actually existing shown news media intelligence agencies around world. Lmao gotteem looks like we've wait till numbers rise even higher till get it. sad politics act Idk, thought /s made sarcasm pretty clear, guess not. highest daily reported case Sweden far.

However, would like remind everyone (and I'm sure applies several countries. It'd interesting know countries still test report level people spring) one important factor interpreting data:

(Copying another comment made):

The cases far number representation spring, even though look specifically graph cases, seems way spring, number cases far levels importantly: done hospital/senior care staff, critically ill risk groups. lot get tested (ie positive cases) considerable risk. test capacity could scaled adequately levels (assumingly resources. Remember, people need test; logistics, lab staff, contact trace, materials etc. countries could scale instantly). 

Everyone else symptoms told self-isolate looking numbers sick leave, vab movement, *it's illogical assume number cases much much higher.*

You see graph difference cases number tests positivity. tests represents *everyone* slightest symptoms, young old, critical ill ""just sneezing bit lately"". tests spring represents senior care/hospital staff, risk groups critically ill.

The rising cases definitely warning signs need taken seriously reach levels spring time, important look data critically. Even enact mask mandates, ton people rural Midwest follow rules one enforce them. 

I working southern KS last month nearest large town got groceries literally handing masks front Wal-Mart walk I'd say half people store wearing them. lady high school board pushing get rid mask mandates school hometown part conspiracy something. Although like think helped us keep mask mandates arguing Facebook started spewing crazy conspiracies think people noticed thought maybe best person listen to.

The complete stupidity lack empathy many people astounds me. Wear mask live life believe *every* hospitalized COVID patient received oxygen cpap/ventilator? know that's true. kissing butt? Road Cormac McCarthy. ive pretty much accepted wife ever tests positive proxy me

now turner moeny pay servants shit, id still avoid initially get tested im care her, itd pretty unlikely get enough especially go full lockdown enough last half week called it. like dude, there's extra 250k dead people america year seriously think hospitals doctors want money? Like seriously? one industry others never run customers. course started rambling various talking points heard news. shortly fired. Oh well. feel better subjected particular stupidity anymore. never heard famous ""Bannon's Banners"" ? Looking forward seeing awards, bashing citizens discussion botched job Germany, Italy, France, et al. 

Oh wait Looking forward reading threads awards, bashing selfish people, discussing government failed threads France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands et al. Hehe exactly. foot fetishist opinion disregarded regardless U-S-A! U-S-A! boss door. thinks Party leftists. 

It’s hard laugh boss’s face, guys.  Jesus Christ, hell wrong people. 

Yeah, one likes wearing mask constantly get fuck it. 

Stabbing someone dumb shit got morons attempted murder charges. take lot people following guidelines, either arrogance ignorance, ruin everyone. places probably able get back pre-pandemic normal vaccine widely available, everyone followed guidelines could least sort semi-normal we're still able things masks distancing. exactly right! incredibly crazy. live small town Arkansas, even _workers_ many stores wear masks, let alone customers. 

All trump flags must coincidence Never. person braindead, bother trying give credence. friend mine went Bermuda recently. thought little silly travel time almost comical much better Bermuda handled do. get negative test boarding plane, get tested got isolate 24 hours room, tested day 4, tested day 7 8, tested leaving.  read thinking satire site, looked url. Jesus fucking Christ. Because, unlike media Dr. Fauci would like believe, there's really direct effect 99% population Remdesivir nothing, yet health authorities push right palms greased $3,000 per treatment. Vitamin mountain observational data correlates milder disease course prophylaxis, getting large dose hospitalized drastically reduces severity disease mortality. yet, public health officials silent campaigning people supplement vitamin would cheap effective.

Why?

1) people actually supplemented vitamin D, number seriously ill people would significantly decrease. sounds like good thing, pushing expensive novel drugs, that's bad thing. sick people sick customers.

2) want continue sell Remdesivir novel patented expensive treatments. care nothing. Whether die bearing. still get paid.

3) pandemic got significantly better manageable, would blow opportunity crisis order continue chip away rights. ""Never let good crisis go waste"" means, solve crisis easy solution take route causes people forfeit rights freedoms gives control seeking it.

Nobody cares health except you. look data Vitamin D, Zinc, Ivermectin, etc determine best course yourself. health priority. want statistic, take personal responsibility educating determining best course available based continually evolving body evidence. Looks like there’s population density idiotic decision making politicians regard stringently control measures applied exacerbates problem. I’m viral immunologist. 

No, media blowing proportion. every aspect immune system equally effective preventing getting reinfected. Circulating neutralizing antibodies important preventing reinfection fact disappointing news seems like aren’t going particularly long lasting. 

Memory cells helpful clearing virus faster second time around, won’t keep getting infected entirely. play politics handling life death situations. People become distrustful authorities. impossible people gain trust government officials, matter good intentions trying do.

Good luck America, gone, world follow. living end times truly. Lame! Well, still important part process. there's chance got vax noticeable. say *willing* accept. I'd say us willing understand choice. studied engineering, law, might misunderstand text: missed part powers states transferred federal government. Isnt law still power anyway regulating mostly travel, medical logistics financial stuff? say? Challenge accepted! Haven’t 44 cases contracted planes? Maybe misheard statistic. True. storm Statehouses guns?  Also, USA healthcare capacity lot better. possibility collapse within system. really absurd. Sweden highest taxes world high incomes, fact alone make scream horror. Thank you. I'm American cares, days, feel like I'm one within social circle. come Reddit remind I'm alone. hope things get better you, friend. Hospital ethics boards determine this, likely Covid patients 60 get ICU beds stop scenario happening, first.  Hand sanitizer temperature checks effective. Trunp: ""The Virus going away .. Ah, way up!"" user blamed democrats it.

Listen, they're little lazy today. Please stop complaining.

If could found way blame Muslims Latinos it, they'd done it. That's sacrifice society asking make.

As American Millennial, country's people become weak. WW2 society willing sacrifice anything everything achieve goals. Today, willing wear masks stay home play video games without whining freedoms.

Do part. Wear mask stay home much possible. Accept means Grandma might dead see again, make sacrifice help country. Yes, people want take vaccine people 40 years more, problem vaccines obrigatory. Mission failed... we’ll get em next time ""my summer holiday!"" Halloween, Christmas New Year front us. 

That's gonna tough one. mentally moreso physically. Also whole Stop Snitching, potentially dragging others it. great? Yes everyone stop living lives hide closets next 10 years. English better lot native speakers. apologize it. thought couldn’t get retarded put foot parents last week seeing sister Christmas. dead set driving across country bringing 83-year-old grandmother already breathing problems oxygen 24 hours day! mother tried convince could safely drive instead fly, they'd get tested leaving etc. simply way make trip even close safe staying home. kept saying ""But seen since last Christmas! children, can't go year without seeing you!"" Yeah, children neither us yet 30 want bury parents last living grandparent go without family Christmas. Stop forcing us grown-ups situation! We're responsible safest everyone! Hospitalizations, deaths, healthcare capacity metrics imo. entirely wrong part behavior. Americans plan future all. Something like 80% people live paycheck paycheck 80% population living near poverty. culture emphasizes consumption much. People buried debt best times. interruption financial world falls apart covid major interruption.  It’s people. example, Ohio mask mandate people wear masks? ....No. 

B cells ones make antibodies. CD8 cells kill infected cells CD4 cells help activate B cells CD8 cells first time you’re infected something (but aren’t needed second time). Good grief. faith humanity already rock bottom apparently still optimistic. look back laugh believed would 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 10 weeks etc lol. Yeah would riots street. “Hey, you’re fucked next 6 months. Enjoy!” changed argument. First talked masks, started talking completely different thing, yea I’d say you’re unfair. *Mission Accomplished sign intensifies* I'm sorry. feel anger. let's germany france doing. (And spain)  People usually get infected attending private gatherings, public

Where could person spreading picked up? appear private places? Oh dear, forgot IFR 6 million% able close border one thing, European leaders complained Trump closing borders ""as dirty germ spreaders"" two days cancelling flights Africa (where refugees might come from). cause kind news quickly buried. TIL two options governance. dystopian YA dictatorship, non-representative republic formed 18th CE. Literally options. choices. CHOICE.

America today. America tomorrow. America forever. true. electoral college issues, gerry-mandering issues, voter suppression issues, etc end day there's still 40% voters fully duped GOP. huge fucking problem. hell protect elderly parents, refuse vaccine me, know need go work everyday? says vaccine obrigatory

That's fucked getting started well. Sit down, buckle up, keep hands inside ride times folks. Rough road ahead bit. Republicans blatant disregard things truthful Yes! coupons too! many want. me, seemed like offering vaccinations get spread lot people (which everyone blames young healthy people doing) would best way reduce R0 protect people. spike? Nice. True, can't exactly announce three month lockdown without significant backlash. Assuming mortality rate around 3% means US death toll soon 15k week Covid.

Which 60k month likely going continue balloon.

I'm honestly expecting death toll hit 7 figures first 6 months 2021.

I'm sorry happened country. Well Aldi/Lidl/Penny/Netto/Norma bunch big names instead. length lockdown tied number cases, arbitrary time frame. Telling people 4 weeks giving people false hope. happens France cannot get covid control 4 weeks. what? kidding. Americans brainwashed thinking theres bandaid everything. really weird. Touching doesn’t spread it. doesn’t get secreted pores. adviced leave apartments things. enforcement. That's awful. terrible time. hope lose friends. people vulnerable able get vaccinated beforehand, doesnt seem like healthy young people vaccinated 2022 awful problem?? Thats good analogy, also explains doesnt work, like masks  It’s crazy displaying sort sympathy towards people losing jobs result increasing restrictions gets labeled lockdown skeptic sub. “believing exclusively science” rhetoric mean can’t care anyone covid patients? somehow exporting cases countries local confirmed 

that's bollocks Watching broadcast wondering everyone suddenly masks end haha Taiwan Hongkong listed second third worst region behind Wuhan, got far infected others' total. better whole China. always sure region China got less infected whole China. former coworker also believed seat belts kill injure people save. college graduate married, too. ""Roughly December 1st. ""

You can't say expect people take word for, especially clearly know talking about. Evidence needed.

""They inform January 3rd""

You're right, then. Dr Li arrested. can't keep saying it, true. intimate knowledge, please stop bullshit.

""Read articles linked you.""

Seriously becoming ridiculous now, look up. December 1st case added retrospectively. really difficult find understand information.

Unfortunately English first language, hence able call bullshit. Try reading past headlines use critical thinking occasionally. U mad?LOL nothing wrong looking back situation happened, learning differently line avoid getting hurt yourself.  would dumb learn someone else’s horrible experience. 

It’s “blaming victim”. 

If woman assaulted walking dark alley alone, I’m *blaming* assaulted, I’m also going walk dark alley alone. going everyone. 99% survivability. mentality right denial reality. elderly otherwise health impaired odds excellent. Tons areas require negative test fly within last 72 hours, (including hawaii) Thought russia approved vaccine putin's daughter took... Ah, good thing traveled MA.. lol Yeah, great. Right little person pulls ring river.  way cruel population overwhelmingly supported it? agency? failure government enforcement mask mandates falls upon people making minimum wage. saw one local papers running list restaurants heated patios, like... that's gonna last long It’s hard make assumptions constantly reports like saying measures need continue there’s never mention they’ll stop take measures end. article perfect example.

They list vaccine 100% effective people still possibly infectious vaccinated (same thing happens flu vaccine) reasons we’ll continue public health measures. Two things eradicate virus improve current situation it’s still good enough.

You want compliance? Stop pushing back goalpost every months realize people struggling right now. KIDS ARENT EVEN SCHOOL! People lives shambles it’s they’ve contracted COVID.

edit: typos  also trickle eventually. People work home thier income gradually affected. I'm waiting everyone accept happening can't close everything. mean pete's sake even cancelled chemo lot people. [White House lists ending Covid-19 pandemic accomplishment despite cases spiking record guys, pandemic take back snark. suppose undercounting several fold, despite testing boatload. 

And whether sufficient, stark relief bad testing nations, eg mexico. bode well global perspective. MASKNE UGH disagree, considering wear mask hate people, people worst public oh hate public. Video italy first wave impact lot people. needs shown.  Antartica! 2025 fast no? think will, 2025?

But corona happens knows. weird outright denial mostly dangerous elderly. media good job scaring people. Mars laughing us, huge meteor like, well fuck that. 

Man,now find video. 

But I’m le’TIRED! asthma, don’t think cut oxygen, think/know increase risk upper respiratory infections. ( I’ve couple lasted week wearing mask normally get one year), also masks given really bad face infections. think feel safer wearing mask should, although shouldn’t dehumanize shame people don’t. I’m sure that’s things work. Thanks!  hitting fan while, we'll see far shit flung anyone willing unplug it.  say required domestic travel? Good. Spread word teachers across country mean... even doesn’t help covid stops needing potentially go hospital doctors office flu. keeps health system lighter would otherwise be, let’s doctors nurses focus real work needs done.

Get flu shot. takes 10 seconds could save life. willing share literally nothing personal liberty. That's excuse use justify wearing masks. reality think hoax and/or think affects liberals big cities, ""who cares""? Viruses evolve less deadly. Parasites want kill hosts. Dead people spread virus, strains kill likely spread throughout population. could treat like every disease When

Roughly December 1st. still question countries identify clearly country.

Asked answered. could cover-up informing WHO.

They inform January 3rd, even reason arrest one doctors intimate knowledge disease allegedly informing over. month? still shown anything prove new month earlier, can't

Read articles linked you. know English might first language, China actually really good ESL education that's excuse. Hah, it'll sooner Florida. governor allowed children visit nursing homes here. Sad Brooklyn bragging hitting ball thing stick thing. utterly horrible. Nothing done federal side control spread, basically person protecting themselves. don’t normally delete comments getting downvotes, made comment clarify point, mods deleted one. Since that’s fair even little bit, took original comment down. 

I’m unsubbing now. Looking comments they’ve allowed stay up, also cached comments deleted, sub definitely censoring comments don’t agree narrative. *""In second inning tonight, lab COVID tests informed MLB Justin Turner’s test yesterday came back inconclusive. samples today arrived run. showed positive. league immediately called Dodgers said pull Turner.""*  would great could thing. worried covid, wear mask, stop badgering everyone else wear one. could get along way.

But stores compelled law require patrons wear masks get shut down. store owner, it’s optional. request people wear mask ask leave. end conflicts people trying follow “the law” crazies. Wow, I’m shocked sub would thing cant post political references word way lol. tested game, played game, pulled batted 7th ( assume) got results Well color surprised... I'm buying masks urethra website great come holidays especially following cheaper give vitamin people rather retarded lockdowns point one group always blamed inciting violence really seem case... Hmm, criminal investigation, one would asking *Cui bono?*. fatalism kind response difficulty understanding. Who’s saying measures never end? Who’s planning 0% eradication? It’s begging question (or least presuming lot) assume extreme statements goal. assumption allows people feel okay ditching recommended safety measures never possibly reach impossible ideals. 

This end sometime, doubt. one plans masking forever. it’s unreasonable say everything goes back normal right vaccination we’re tired it. may take months get back normal. People higher risk dying COVID going care interacting properly supermarket. Properly keeps alive.

I saying it’s fair follow guidance science—CDC, local dept public health, etc.—when deciding stop masking distancing shared public places old sick people go. include bars, restaurants, even concerts, friend’s house, etc. prove?

That Israel working America buy vaccines. see Mossad either 'stealing' samples Moderna vaccine, Israeli government asking US government provide samples open channel, why?

Because America Israel allies. even suspect

It's always fascinated tiny country live rent free 24/7 minds conspiracy theorists. r/nonewnormal

I wonder flu recorded CDC year? call. MLB controls that. pulled mid game. definitely happened site odd, including phone number disconnected Covid? thanks. Lol Trump's world adjust minimum wage inflation let pandemic kill employment. Pretty sure Dr. Fauci also said need surgical grade masks recently purchased 100 3-ply masks $8.99+tax free shipping Amazon. ""Yes certain country lied came from. ""

When. still question countries identify clearly country.

""This call cover up.""

Yes people look facts call cover-up. could cover-up informing WHO.

""It take month China inform WHO""

What month? still shown anything prove new month earlier, can't

""had reason arrest one front-line doctors talking it. anything input would essential WHO. ""

He arrested. eye doctor, valuable input think someone misinterpreted internal memo might had.

Seriously, actually look facts details. mean think makes someone idiot, kinda explains lot. I’ll sell zip decent weed $200  older people do.

Correlation != causation ah yes virus 99.5% survival rate kill everyone point there’s economy Atlanta It’s going Saturday. Yeah. Especially around metro stations  think murders would decrease murderers guns instead machetes? Yeah, it’s great place probably hit already March/April. Guessing we’ll higher 250k one day peak Sadly seems take get mandate. interesting. makes sense. feel like home always boring person living it. part expat aspirations. get bored cities seem interesting times. def try explore areas world chance! Covid WS! guarantee team knew likely it, willing let lime play chance winning WS girls “Karens”? yet see anyone WEARS masks get violent anti maskers.

Well yeah. Generally people wear masks reluctant touch people, especially people don’t wear one. Fall basically started. foreplay. We're definitely fucked come winter. rest Union 'highly discourages' New Yorkers visiting anywhere except Staten Island. 

Get fucked, Cuomo. going cliff. Honestly. cannot fathom I, C19 testing worker follow rules, yet average Florida Man Woman cannot. matter money. care others - have. Me, me, me. ""I"" inconvenienced. ""I"" wanna wear mask. ""I"" gottah see friends party. 

When country falls apart hungry street, begging non-existent food...Maybe even understand *they themselves.* Day one back work ""I know fire sprinkler system went off. Oh well, working home is""  Yikes! heard last this, especially tested positive game. drove brink despair. nothing else, they're nailing that! That's good strategy, keep case growth exponential, deaths catch weeks month seem trivial comparison.

You probably pay strategy ways passed election day everything collapses. even open article? notice side effects? worried might've gotten placebo? limited data this, anyone sticking fingers ears you!!!! 

Make sure set reminder thread too, scientists start change conclusions, clearer picture going due DATA!!!

WTF anti-vax too? agree studies limited set data make science denier lol. swear people sub need get heads asses. 

This virus NOVEL virus learning new things transmits effects human body every day. fluid situation data constantly changing. rational, logical person little paranoia belief conspiracies, I’m starting feel like large minority people quite literally crazy, brainwashed, dumbed-down, irrational full rage. 

I don’t follow much media watch/read lot news outside science/medicine/general world events, times feels like things really tipped extreme end pendulum. news, reddit still thinks tautologies news. Shady fuck. shows freaking bad even political loyalist loyal sat silent somebody suggested disinfectant light bulbs r finally speaking out, refusing toe party line

This makes worried bad going be

Even scientific miracle vaccine soon time distribute, unknow effectiveness length effect, plus weaponsed ant vaccination people riled certain people power - even avccibe good go tomorrow going take long time get enough treated make difference means lots suffer, many deaths time tell many survivors medium long term effects Try turning heat 5 minutes like there's enough air circulating turn fuckers back on. quickly number double know, know two people bipolar disorder could see stabbing someone fit rage days took medication. excuse course, seem consistent disease. B.S. think lot Trudeau's 'speeches' whatnot pandemic ment way communicate, rally, people feel like left dark forgotten. Usual political bullshit aside, PM leader, good leader absolutely tell people 'should' done, even don't/can't enforce law.


In BC actually gotten kinda funny observe. one side mad province make masks required, anti-maskers yelling rights even though been, isn't, likely mask 'law'.   course silent majority sitting watching confused. Masshole - combination students partying, folks getting pandemic fatigue.

Where am, *think* might start moving right direction couple weeks. parties neighborhood really died down, means students either taking seriously, really struggling hybrid schooling; folks already started showing store without mask back wearing them. I've seen lot less dick-noses past week so, too, good. general, folks seem starting take things seriously again.

The flip side is, still fair number people tired putting restrictions gatherings love going bars parties stuff like that; getting colder out, making porches patios less hospitable places gather. Overall, we're fairly precarious position right now, suspect winter going pretty hard everyone here.  ICU happen.

False: one study, kids admitted also goes away own.

Also false: abate treated early, otherwise develop long-term illness. That’s Russian disinformation you. starts darkest cracks internet echos regular places. no. Yes simplified. states kept numbers low mostly contact tracing. Vic got control needed much stricter lock down. R/agedlikemilk oh cool retreating lies said earlier lol  Yeah famous Chinese propoganda machine Deutsche Welle. There’s LOT don’t know yet. failed German test can't help :( Germany, please take me! computer science major cook yummy food! also like clean! It’s almost begging invited in. couldn’t imagine basically mocking parents putting granddaughter front couldn’t stay. That’s cruel. Last optimists right here. Facebook become plague itself. Growing parents would tell believe everything internet. believe everything facebook. That's pathetic it’s called observation, stats mask usage businesses cities compare let’s see them.

Or made assertion can’t defend you’re latching onto anecdotal observation deflect?  Thanks. 

It completely backwards.  course week, maybe week half old. (The infection)

I blood, wife son almost 2. was/is mild, wife son. 

My son worst 102 degree temp 91 blood O2. told us gets worse take hospital. 

I'm proponent masks sure... definitely silver bullet. (I'm blown away still provided everyone N95... definitely capable it) 500k know of. many still missing? photo he's super cute! I'll see Facebook picture it. weather actually leading unsafe gatherings full winter? cold enough drive people inside, cold enough make people STAY inside. 

i've lived Minnesota, people really like get much break 15 degrees two weeks row. Australia Vietnam. China obviously pulled fast one us. I’ve felt way. It’s almost like I’m... oddly disappointed it’s apocalyptic worst case scenario scared of? dunno, disappointed isn’t right word don’t want apocalypse. word “this situation cleared lowest bar worst fears, I’m ready celebrate yet.” fucking ghetto wtf know community people backing system “racist” Thankfully I've taking magnesium help lessen migranes 🙌 even get paid, weird nationalism thing. facebook friends I'd considering picking holiday gig Target something little extra pocket money I've apparently forgotten fucking awful retail is. man, can't even imagine much worse right extra burden tell people put masks on. Hey hate people much next people hater still wear mask don’t want actuall kill anyone Go physio instead. promise two definitely Trump voters. guarantee actually People wear sunglasses much likely sunburnt.

It’s necessary causative effect. Maybe pandemic originated Wuhan, China beginning. convenient treat cases China asian countries separately. categorization still useful cases China seldom imported. test positive Canada call ask several questions make sure you, FYI. took get joke. upvote. I'm still waiting proof. not? sneaking suspicion don't. can't even believe US high sustained infection rate, still part one big wave that's exponentially getting worse :/ provided everyone hand sanitizer placed big hand sanitizer stations near entrance building. also require everyone wear masks you’re hallway common space office (if one, lots folks cubes). know won’t though. delay counting. fight it. throw hissy fits January. I’m legit scared. want hug boyfriend tell love Hospitalization surge bad. stuff didn’t happen March April quickly locked could happen now. Imagine bucket paint falls shelf splits head open, rushes ER, turn away. “Sorry cannot accept additional patients hospital.” next closest ER 30 minutes away.

This could actually happen certain cities. absolutely horrible allowed reach point anywhere, ever. 37% people countries thought China handled pandemic well…Unbelievable. Stupid Labor Day! “Disregard entire thread bullshit provide stat!” need good magnesium intake trending higher? 

Oh mention death toll headline. virus rare cases, give something like kawaski syndrome. 

You'll ICU happen. 

Kawaski also goes away own. case get it, *1984* instruction manual unrelated correlation. 

Lots people wear seatbelts involved car crashes. ""being hospitalized covid"" severe ""not hospitalized""? Sadly, think anyone choice. get catastrophe already catastrophic. lunatics think politics protect pandemic, we're learning like trying argue gravity. every 1% rise unemployment, 37000 people die. problem people taking seriously. question is: point get people start taking seriously? country gets allocated *multiple* BNO updates per day, that’s know you’re entering dire territory.

Another redditor referred BNO Newsroom Index (BNI).  think easy forget little information COVID March terms worked disease *and* NYC got *crushed*. city size many patients meant lot people get timely care.

I suspect we've gotten better treating COVID, honestly much affect thr death rate compared March may depend lot overrun hospitals get. 

Also. think July numbers came lot states *know* using um... creative... ways count deaths keep numbers low. 

So think mix those. 500,000 people actually sick winning. Uh....do know autoimmune diseases caused?

If COVID always leaves system intact, explain Kawasaki Syndrome. I'll wait. trenches mass graves Hart Island NYC refrigerator morgue trucks open peoples eyes morbid possibilities, think much will. can't anything Oh don't, get paid 24/7 spread across timezones. Citrate available store. made poop looooot sometimes. Glycinate got online fine.

Basically anything oxide. don’t really know specific brand, figure check online reviews. Kind crapshoot though.

But supplement worth it. I’m “magically better” anxiety depression kept trying new things kind roundabout realized really good week I’d started taking magnesium citrate whim. on/off weeks journaling mood research actual science journals sure enough found worked WELL (and others). take trying find improve brain pretty seriously try document systematically try things. took mg initially heard needed take vitamin supplements. Yeah correlation causation.

Many people wear sunglasses get sunburnt, don’t think sunglasses cause sunburn.

This worth investigating further, doesn’t prove anything yet. Still stats, eh? I'm still waiting justify bullshit 90%-of-Denver-and-vicinity statement. I'm *sick* winning. headlines posted words like rewriting story WWE fight. Journalists always seem think public officials middle big smackdown brawl. HI sent QR code no? feel like saying dont panic virus... instead everyone heard "" virus real cant hurt you"" Time Halloween parties. Got it! Pretty sure there’s ACE2 receptors mouth throat. would never eat food coronavirus it. Auto immune diseases use immune system you. dont go away.

COVID leaves system, either causing disease immune system fought off, that's fact. read ""reefer trailers"" completely confused minutes. Prayers Canada. stiil holloween parties? Lmao “disregard straw man bullshit prove anecdotal observation Denver business patrons follow mask rules!” 

So you’re going address total failure demonstrate Polis like republicans who’ve done nothing? gotta try harder that, kid  think lot people underestimate much effort stabbing takes. Stabbing someone 27 times takes ton stamina pull shows real malice. leaked surprise. happening. father drinker fiend. hit every day. said wear mask. said no. like that. one bit. grabs knife says wear mask! sticks blade mouth says. Wear mask! wear mask. posted multiple times today. 27.

That's...  can't even. commuted work trains, someone would asking money running operation every day Well-said. sincerely hope teachers across country quit. Normally, I'm pro-public education, American parents administrators need taught brutal lesson value educators. traveling holidays. Latino part identity Obama job, literally. means contact tracing shit That's pretty cool. know that. I'll def look up. Pretty neat info. Thanks sharing this. Also, r/CovidEconomy. cool. grandmother begged see people months passed. imagine listening that? to. Yeah true, Moroccan Gvt copy France's decisions lot since pandemic started. (I'm Moroccan btw) also bunch boycotts, rip France 🌚  point get bad people start caring? 1 million cases day? Seriously it’s getting point.  really hope make people return home office possible. insane propel still working offices clogging public transport necessary many jobs think viruses die off? even worth debating you. disagree, short term market goes up, bitcoin goes up, market goes down, bitcoin goes down... prove otherwise sweet summer child. let’s honest, think short term. Gotta gotta do. 

Spend months thinking covid gone everyone's partying like covid thing past (to EU's credit... mostly get control while). 

Well... gone. goes exponential, there's stopping it...   hard keep going like obvious, still people tell masks work mask mandates work, evidence prove completely common sense issue, better.

Right /u/thepatientislight ? Ugh happening Kansas City. mask mandate KCMO area, people surrounding areas don’t believe Covid real filling hospitals fast. Last week, think hospitals briefly diverting patients many bad Covid cases come in. That's called revenge Serious questions , exactly start get ready ? att already social distancing, working home, washing hands, buying groceries online utterly bored, Thankyouverymuch. 

What mind? not? sub isn’t coronavirus Europe. Trump tweeted exact thing. tell preparations make I'm convinced lockdown achieve anything anymore aside maybe flattening curve. USA next lol need buy-in public work though. hard enforce home gatherings example. 

A lot people virus care get infected anymore. Yeah back July even brought national guard test island employees bc outbreak. Everyone lives works part right things.. people visiting not. Nobody covid everyone covid. Right? Right.....  isn’t logic per se, I’m stating conditions Europe tackle crisis. strategy like non-feasible, logistically, also human rights perspective. 

I guess Iceland could it. Maybe even UK/Ireland could done it. mainland Europe, eradication policy like Australias’ possible. winning right? [Oh no!!! old weak people!! Noooo!!!! That’s problem. needs country wide else flare areas never get back normal. Gotta watch mods! recover 100% damage health.

did come future studies show scar tissue lungs covid fine? help yellow vests protests last year. Police can't work enough people oppose rules. Lockdowns right Christmas New Year.... iirc that's Bastille fell. prevent experts saying, complete honesty, ""there peer reviewed studies demonstrating testicular damage impaired spermatogenesis Covid-19 patients, yet unpublished larger studies indicating 50% decrease sperm volume, concentration motility. suggest Covid-19 infection may effect male fertility, even symptoms resolved.""

Li et al, 2020. [Impaired spermatogenesis COVID-19 *EClinicalMedicine*, p.100604. 

Jerusalem Post. [COVID-19 could cause male infertility - new Israeli mention inflation all? literally comment. Trump*** can’t really tell, since Test lot Come US better need #1 spot back. Burn masks. winning promised?  US problem. still listening vaccine Dec 2021 ""normalcy"" next year bullshit. whole 2 weeks shutdown stuff Feb? Anybody real world experience crossed state borders knows stopping people moving across country state lines without draconian measures asinine. Literally things Federal government, news sites administrators globally mostly crock shit. change plan every two weeks adjust outrage. rinse repeat. null someone wherewithal wear mask prevent external entry foreign virus. no, ""plan"" political, vary state state, arbitrary bullshit measures imposed. people things months ago rabid teeth wanting people get vaccine mask work prison camps people hearing ""two weeks"" saying things like ""no way man, can't see people anymore going crazy, Ill wear mask fuck you"". beyond comical going back profiles seeing said March/May. Ew Newark... almost inevitable - election next week R0 1 nearly every state. see scenario worse 7 days. respond US comment UK France? Oi can't smell Rock cooking. It’s funny man, worse ever has; aren’t lockdowns stay home schools started August. Also takes 2 weeks past infection naming outliers. average period develop symptoms within 5 days infection. 97% show symptoms within first 11.5 days infection. Since average incubation period 5 days anyone getting sick September first symptoms say September 8 least, get tested chill say September 21 test negative again. Yeah don’t think schools issues argue since millions students stuck home going seems way. reference, Poland 3x populous Belgium number daily tests. biggest issue people work companies offices abroad, offices abroad go hurdles moving american employees dont know brave word. worry kids don’t think probably know they’re risking. nothing best? Wow America. many countries managed get reasonable levels.  see stocks years end? Yes, major cable news organizations one job - keep one glued TV - revenues. Sean Hannity - 20 million dollars year - that's deliver news, that's re-enforce confirmation bias, hold viewership (and CNN probably guilty, Fox absurd). Stool banks keep frozen stool fecal transplantation, maybe there. Dunno long keep samples. Welcome dark side. I've long time. country sucks. sucked anyone blames Trump delusional. made suck more. Ain't truth know Jeff Winger says Community running class president. Hidalgo county native. hit hard. also taking better precautions places now. That's main reason second wave. schools open like tarrant dallas we'd pretty bad right now. fraction population got it, we're immune yet Wisconsin State Supreme Court ruled back May governor legal authority order lockdown recommendation option Evers he's stripped power issue mandate. least use right word, shutdown lockdown. germany never lockdown. dracarys! flu shot 12% effective?

Edit: CDC says 19% lmao fuck vote Better start packing! Also, make sure separate clinicians public health officials. Many clinicians mediocre cogs machine without nefarious motives. Public health officials actually involved perverse incentives questionable ethical decisions. That's *I* said ""public health officials"" reason conflated clinicians. I'm glad gave opportunity talk shatter ""omniscient"" physician trope makes people trust mediocre professionals far should. Second opinions must. Wishing us world well being- many nations struggling best citizenry still contingency plan stopping administration. Oh wait, say we've stopped it. lot brainwashed/uninformed people believe it. good bitcoin Belgium political situation really hard grasp, even belgians.
But short answer is: form federal government, must majority different parties regions (Flanders Wallonia).
The problem political opinions diverge sharply two regions therefore difficult find common ground form government.

It took 16 months election May 2019 formation government October 1, 2020.
During time, ""interim government"" minority government coronavirus crisis respond it. quoting Ayn Rand. can't serious. desired pandemic response would counted megadeaths. People come lockdowns right time holidays. suggesting done before, even challenged still happen.

Parts already ruled otu courts scientific data support restrictions. Different, service rolled free, on-demand honestly quite extensive. article change title ""**Dow drops 900 points mounting concerns coronavirus global economic recovery""**  **""Dow drops 800 points mounting concerns coronavirus global economic recovery""** unless support tyrannical unchecked totalitarian government rule you, way achieve ""total lockdown"" western countries. can't go welding people's doors shut like china did.

And honestly, pandemic end. point. Maybe 1 year, maybe 10, would prefer suffer pandemic personal liberties rights taken away us eternity.

All western governments urge people behave responsibly. must hold fellow citizens accountable use social means enforce ideas. Government led abuses power nothing help anyone, end taking freedoms away, long past pandemic.

Think second ""mandate"" folks. know didn't.... mean this. 

We need thinking like war economy. war Covid like went WW2, whole economy needed shift support war effort. 

We labor, raw materials, manufacturing space. we're lacking leadership implement plan. 

I'm optimistic vaccine route going slam dunk think might... course hope think need thinking alternatives means controlling pandemic. like car safety, seat belts, air bags, enforce drunk driving, one things perfect, implement mitigation see vehicle fatalities decrease. need treatments, need vaccines, need avoid indoor areas, need social distancing, need better ventilation filtration indoor areas, need cheep quick testing, need robust contact tracing every person needs N95's given free. dramatics France? dont think I've ever seen someone (in 8 years here) pushing 150kg range isnt athlete. They're normal weight range sure. mutations causing antigenic drift seen flu viruses.

Coronaviruses known extremely conserved antigens along one's highly unstable. hemagglutinin targeted flu vaccines extremely unstable, targeted best target neutralizing antibodies. developing vaccine coronavirus much challenge find conserved antigens target.  Periodic restrictions travel predictable work much better free all, economy that's care don’t think know hot take don’t think it’s ever going finished unless cure vaccine comes vaccine actually works thought case numbers doubling month bad. Tripling month like Belgium though... that's good trendline. would love answer moderator keeps deleting political. guess answer political.  Cases ideal metric comparison due major testing deficiencies, especially early wave. Deaths accurate. Thank youu! seem really sweet  Obviously doesn't. He's place. First says masks work, do. Lockdowns work, don't. also seem understand stay. understand shutting things ""for two weeks flatten curve"" turns summer, turned whole year, even says well next yr yr after, really hurts working americans way virus ever would. understands one thing one thing only. viruses work. leave decision making elected make decisions. Death extremely improbable outcome contracting covid-19 America really needs invest mental health education. That’s issue 40% feel Trump good job handling virus. wasn’t thinking fogged door office breath, it’s door inside, outside.

Should Lysol door okay leave? police do. Many deserve it. Many not.  That's article II says. disastrous uptick EU last weeks really challenged view different societies handling virus well versus poorly.

It really hasn't. EU leaders believe attempting solve it, USA believes letting runs course. minneapolis 9.5 miles st. pauls 5. connect market bounce like recovery history, whipsaw reaction flood liquidity.

Now whipsaws down, unless new flood liquidity catches market 3rd time Powell, see real downturn ie. decade peak like previous downturns. Maybe worse things terrible. 17,000 think. ICU 1/3 peaked at, doubt lag hospitalisation ICU increases think admit we're getting sick shit ignore Redditors think locking quarantine six years epic gamer moment

i also think controversial admit small aspects life gonna pretty different awhile. we're gonna catharsis getting lives back fun events, exact replica 2019 world. generate new money. failured organs death it’s less easy. one said anything rest anyone’s life. one even said schools shut another year. Schools relatively easy thing fix, majority states currently testing hybrid programs. said, pandemic gets worse, better schools stays shut awhile, going do... kidnap teachers drag school teach you? lol. Gatherings sizes aren’t banned anymore, prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed. one likes sometimes things don’t like greater good. guess response child though maybe genuinely don’t understand covid-19 become weaker? infection rate stronger, fatality lower spring. Fuck. public campaign get people correct levels D. this, would significantly change severity pandemic similar widespread mask usage. I've 2 telehealth visits, nobody says crap Vitamin D. Hospitals putting forth drives test people promote supplementation. People stare blankly bring Vitamin average people fucking clue there's effort make aware. 

I never said Vitamin secret treatment. data studies get posted time. public health officials nothing it. aint exactly black plague? wow Islands compared. getting Europe North America car? immense majority people comply, like first time. police gendarmerie enforcing lockdowns. control vehicles people walking outside see went (we carry affidavit every time go out) good reason out. tickets get expensive quickly every time get caught flaunting rules. I'm sure defiance, overall people stay home. Someone tell POTUS stock markets =/= economy.... 

we terrible winter know go anywhere. Holy shit! 4000+ new infections day, people wearing masks? Wow, that's insane! blows mind. Well, also behaviours slow spread might endure forever, like work-from-home, tolerate ease long time, like hand sanitizer. Others, like cheap air travel might go away airlines fold demand drops, get back matter what. Men country used shake others hands day women kissed cheeks...that might gone good. tiny incremental reduction risk adds up. We'll probably find new equilibrium hazard needs, knows is? Where’s chill? god, isn’t any. 

Anyway, bye. seems bit excessive. think pandemic control, countries would willing open borders back American tourists. Yes honestly, anyone saying issue important plain ignorant. Yes want save many lives can, fucks sake, literally everyone dying either old obese, would pretty fucking significant determine ready society actually open back up, lockdowns also coat lives, mostly younger ones problem enough people leave, what's stopping fucking moronic psychos left nuking rest world. even understand concept MAD. Hmmmm, think baseless speculation. I'm sure rare extreme introverts love lockdowns, however I'm convinced tiny sliver people. know exactly zero people want stay home long term anymore.

I agree assessment people earning living, think find many disagree you. ebay seller performotor dptmotorsport. go low 3.99 days. bought box try $5 compared BYD masks got Officedepot BYD's surgical masks level 2 sold Amazon costco. Quality comparable earloops great. 
Can't beat price try out. order since many.
BTW, looking certified KN95 masks FDA approved, look Powecom masks. earloop design fit pretty good. Sellers OfficeDepot bonafidemask.
3M masks, guess could buy magidglove(dotcom) valve design. 
I bought sellers personal stash go stock things get bad state(NY) know virus could run office, fascinating. dreaming think anyone else oval would've different outcome chief. we're seeing first wave vaccines, going provide full fledged protections we're accustomed seeing vaccines. going help, sure, seem targeting creating less severe cases creating full fledged immunity. Efficacy still seems 50% range is, again, helpful great others 90+% efficacy. 

I'm assuming kind stuff still worked likely close ready. watching interesting doc someone recommended bubonic plague London, idea spread murdered street dogs cats low-class areas thought dirty causing plague. Little know exasperated spread nothing keep rats bay... whoopsies. know guys got countries have? 

*Space*.

- Czechia, 135 people / km2
- Belgium, 375 p/km2
- Israel, 420 p/km2
- US, 34 p/km2

Comparing performance based infections per head fine, understanding context behind numbers important too. next worst country list 4 times population density next-next worse 11 times much, number loses meaning they're playing game ultra hard guys story mode. see balance 3 weeks now. Typically hospitalizations increase 2 increase cases deaths 3 weeks advent cases good hope nations follow suit. world locked 4 weeks could end virus.  Yes, surely brought IFR somewhat - there's actual evidence have. affect rate deaths rise, however. r/im14andthisisdeep yeah compared 2, stocks pretty good shape think would passed stimulus bill right election get reelected. Instead angered poor people also rich people too. did. cited noted epidemiologist Ivanka Trump (I really wish joking) Conjunctivitis symptom. thought that, too. close eye shows bleeding inside eyeball. 

Which leads question got that, right? weight yet boomers hold something like 80% stocks registered accounts, versus like 20% everyone else.

Boomers largely fixed income, fixed income stinks. Basically market environment pushed people equities, I'd assume since crash.

Edit: yes long term bonds rallied there, we've basically zirp decade. That's true either, Dallas experiencing second wave. wonder constant hand sanitizing about. 

 
Although sons sick least every two months since pandemic started due daycare whole time. state months gatherings banned size, mask mask. accept wearing mask gather awhile I’m going school zoom rest life. Even negative ones get positive counts ? Chances case you’re business curbside delivery, delivery, takeout understand public health guidelines. drove drunk still survived, good right?

I think question less whether _can_ it, whether should.

For comparison, 30 people die day accidents involving intoxicated driver(probably couple happened without alcohol). wish covid dangerous.

Edit - swypo

Edit 2 - clear, I'm accusing OP driving drunk went bar, comparing risk. 400 million debt ""small amount debt,"" coming from, ""the man people.""

Most people know working blue collar jobs would get significant amounts stress get surprise bill $300, even make day. days :) 

I upvoted you. bought? Yeah, think point. vaccine change things lot matter wave is, like three waves happen prolonged. Google quote wow can't believe actually said that. might true, pretend conservative evangelical christianity anything occuring nation (and decades past) know couple nice religious folks disingenuous. 


generally, one spouts religion, worse human. get politicians megapreachers going muslims abortions like, purely toxic political theater point think understands things. He’s trying contain virus protect economy healthcare. Lockdowns aren’t necessary spread uncontrollable. He’s opposed national lockdowns measures. Well it’s good everyday life like grocery stores go mask free lot sooner year now. won’t able tolerate another full year masks, regardless makes “selfish” “someone doesn’t care people” according people forum.  Shit thirty minutes speech, smells bad. eagerly await presentation statistics deaths attributable face coverings physical distancing. like people need stimulus meaning imply that. said viruses can't spread die off, talking individuals. 

When comes species virus itself, billions billions individual viruses die species fine, that's viruses work. produce many viruses likely least small number find another host. 

I said lockdowns ""obviously work"" 2 humans physically separated never come contact, virus 0 chance spreading. saying lockdowns seen covid effective means, that's clearly case. Obviously humans never going lockdown total success resistance. gives virus chance continue spreading least small degree, species continue exist. humans lockdown, less potential hosts infect. Oh wow, horrible! required work nursing home places positive symptomatic sounds like catastrophe waiting happen. can't even imagine forced situation. example lack unions means zero outlets vent kinds violations. go press, automatic pink slip matter severe infraction whistleblow...and potentially report licensing board well. Yeah, I'm usually lot activities n stuff friends, change much either, basically last months me. Good acted shit hits fan even more, hope people comply measures effective... believe White House said we're already better. [This] “He didn’t anything basement!” 

Do anything what?

“The hoax plandemic!” 


That they’ll firmly commit Democrats spread plague purpose. they’ll believe without hint irony. parties focused strategy winning (or weird cultish ideology) care actually passing stimulus. 

Bullshit.

Only Republicans blocking it. shit?  similar story firefighters entering burning buildings likely get burned. go again, front TV wait Macron announcements happening three minutes. Realistically probably whats going happen remember, way. factored in.

even vaccine releases December, takes time distribute vaccinate everyone, assuming there's form tier system priority.

with infection rate 10-15%, reaching approximately 30% may, added vaccination, see reduction spread due beginning herd immunity.

but reality, takes lot time happen, especially broad scale. absolutely right, friend. lot people knew right start. working paper pencil bring military use fax machines call people days later. call repeatingly others never. monday close everything illusion ""normal"" christmas. sometimes think movie titanic. ship sinking band still playing ;-)  Italy  word vaccine coming play? Fauci said end 2021 semblance normalcy.

That’s one year, “Years”. misleading title. Gotta cardio work lung volume... Still, Australia bounded. Europe not. spin-off SETI@Home, no, scam :P  went unprecedented lockdown 23 January - time virus killed 17 people affected 400.

It week China confirmed human-to-human transmission virus taken place, something previously proven.

Wuhan left eerily silent went lockdown

The city 11 million people entirely cut rest China, thousands people next months tested placed quarantine. large public gatherings cancelled people told avoid gathering.

By March, lockdown slowly started ease. ""

when china cares citizens USA lol goal comes back, vaccines hopefully option. last lockdown gave France 5 months deaths, low circulation virus saved tens thousands lives. Germany really well first wave. Part reason guess lesson sink in. Second wave definitely going bigger. hope get levels see Czech Republic, France GB. mean it’s magical fairy dusty make things normal immediately? refuse listen!!! -99% sub. airports/planes, congregate care facilities, doctor offices would probably big 3. maybe grocery stores, probably not. things probably go mask-free.

as second part, expect current BLM protests stop pandemic goes away nothing pandemic. 

and, mean, climate action take hundred different forms, hope 2020 made least people realize fragility ""normal"" enjoy. climate collapse going lead lot zoonotic disease outbreaks probably future pandemics. nobody wants go shit again. think he's correct regards virus get bigger picture constitutionality, law, economics come play. good portion people restrictions negative impact Covid Dakota v Dole

err exact opposite say above?

wiki: Supreme Court held 7–2 statute represented valid use Congressional authority Spending Clause statute infringe upon rights states. Court established five-point rule considering constitutionality expenditure cuts type:

1. spending must promote ""the general welfare.""
2. condition must unambiguous.
3. condition relate ""to federal interest particular national projects programs.""
4. condition imposed states must not, itself, unconstitutional.
5. condition must coercive. mitigate

it feels like people skip part. like ""take action eradicate deal move on"". like masks. masks never 100% safeguard; help mitigate reduce risk. people decided extra precautions necessary affects personally realize careful.

it's beyond frustrating. ...and effective is. many people take it. humans forgot virus. looks like virus didn’t forget them. Next Season 08 2020.

We therefore, dialogue County Medical Offices, decide situations recommendations wear face mask could valuable national regional level. Examples situations could visit optician cannot avoid using public transport even though crowded.

Face masks must always seen complementary recommendations: stay home symptoms, wash hands regularly keep distance others."" We’re found idiots, too? worked really well France, look graphs.

It bunch important stuff well. 

People taking vitamin regardless covid. 

""Vitamin multiple roles body. assists in:

It's best take vitamin vitamin K either eat something fatty take fish oil vitamin fat soluble. Big misconception! masks barely keep Covid out, massively keep spittle in—which Covid spreads. everyone wears them, protect other. Get sure. indication states worst time right might see turn better, areas, like Northeast start spiking severely. could see conspiracy sites use prove covid ""just flu"" 🙄 would great actually, since based reports, countries active outbreaks took proactive disease measures like mandatory mask mandates, limiting/cancelling social events, strong contact tracing backing, good hygiene, testing etc like Singapore, South Korea etc manage keep numbers low manage carry economic life close normal much possible past peak phase.

The issue comes places little restrictions place, even restrictions place enforcement. 

Due nature particular virus spreads, know 2 months longer lockdown completely rid virus, given Wuhan strict lockdown 70 days + still mange find cases infection. helped hit nail coffin last remaining infection strong disease control mass testing. 

Lockdowns help communities buy time mitigation, prevent healthcare systems overwhelmed overwhelmed. pointless authorities wanted operate life per normal. speaking ass here. Almost. Still smells less intense before. perfectly understandable people push back criticism him. lot people either spreading misinformation, trying mislead people. least voice reason us criticizing taken serious difficult. respect find position depressing, still hold accountable lies told save skin. Sequelae: abnormal condition resulting previous disease. way said felt like implying deserved get stabbed

That’s ridiculous. psychopath would think anyone deserves get stabbed 27 times trying grab phone. doesn’t even make sense anyone would think trying say. 

It’s depressing reddit try hardest read *worst possible* message comment, even it’s completely unlikely it’s saying. 

I can’t even explain keep removing follow-up comments “political”, even though assure you, aren’t. super rare case actually deleted comment mine getting downvoted. one probably disappear too, I’m sure bothered. rapid test requires higher viral load detect positive, always trigger positive enough virus detected?

So happens infected infectious, small viral load rapid test pick up?

Then get long flight become infectious symptoms increase time.

I mean, sure, ideally everyone 100% masked properly wearing whole time, know planes super-spreader potential due air filtration, travel logistical conundrum without COVID deal with, adding rapid testing prior boarding would muck whole system even already is. Trump said we'd stop hearing Nov 4th...:p world followed lead everything would open right now, including travel people would safe. No, isn't. sister told virus done election /s mainly issue winter months high latitudes. think drop vitamin fortified milk consumption contributed. wonder redditors scared covid!! Ooh. Two one deal.

Reinfection? Reasonable human beings like avoid infecting others deadly disease. reasonable human being? Wtf.

Not cool. Also, Rips Tears think that? study Spain. source found said 33% Spaniards deficiency, however 60% elderly people France, Belgium, Italy deficiency. Furthermore, COVID transmissible indoors, deficient people likely spend time indoors.


I fear may correlation, causation. wearing least? mine 3 weeks ago. germany free everyone, everyone getting one either ignorant it, arrogant, lazy full anti vax.

You dont want come flu corona promise that. expression picked horse racing use wealthy supporters; nascar poor supporters. Yea, virus infects bodily organs. Sure people ""recover"" fully. cost taking care previously infected going add lot coming years. feel like likely die murder Covid murdered Covid retail. happened AstraZeneca hold? That's um concerning. want NZ bad rn People really hate hearing facts  

If made decisions based data, would quarrantine everyone 70 let rest population get quickly possible.  would FAR effective vaccine (because real thing), done back June knew age range safe, would completely mess now. Wait Americans start seeing chronic illnesses mount up. Year year toll healthcare cost country. start taking megadoses vitamin D, screw body's calcium levels. We've already day, know it. ""In Utah hospitals could days away using patient's age, health ""other factors"" determine remain ICU."" imagine ""other factors"" are. mean, president literally says ended pandemic day numbers record highs, higher ever rising exponentially, says test less looks better refuses promote masks, sane people lot say despotic dictator lies 24/7 people voted keep voting him. better example would provinces China. 

There national border, provinces (or cities, rare cases, villages) set border measures restrict travelling regions. crucial workers (e.g. truck drivers) must follow strict protocol.

But strict border control enough. Enforced quarantine contact tracing also played important part. Vietnam well, countries failed (Singapore, initially, quickly learned).

If provinces, closer Wuhan natural border, control spread acting swiftly, every country can. spent day loved it, definitely need time fully appreciate city. Mission accomplished! Wait I've seen banner before. really great comfort know loved ones I've lost year died something big deal town, really puts perspective me. Thankfully.  need unplug already clogged. midwest probably least amount hospitals per capita, certainly ventilators needed spike. death wave come make New York's look like best case scenario. FUCKED True. already want add testing airports could best way. Pretty sure it’s fast. California better Florida recent weeks adjust population. good California new case rate third less Florida’s. can't find mention Foxnews. sure buy it. Surviving spreading auntie, uncle, grandma grandpa, end ventilators dead. Aren’t mild cases great? They’re like going around town AK-47, especially mask mandates. Next. Even kill remaining populations, still leaves side effects, researches still done side effects are. 

But agree you, ppl pile supplies. reduce going out. maybe understand stabbed guard once, 27 times indicates something crazy. Haloween becomes popular among children young people Asia days? that’s dumb. actually seems like spread gaining steam mask orders enacted. 

Swedens health department says masks people get false sense security them. Without masks, people inclined stay fuck away others.  might right. Probably 2 weeks Halloween really. 

You *know* parties. Asshole personality disorder. I’m sorry grandpa. 

Agreed, cool. appreciate it. Take care. took ten minutes cruise CDC page Covid, mean get special flair like you? Scariest Halloween ever Things edge 6 weeks. Imagine DJ work since april. cant wait 6 weeks. Starting distribution something swap better one later. think also case virus spreading it, levels low test pick (which also dig deep nose swab, want pick virus lives). agree. Bipolar excuse stab someone 27 times. 1 time? Maybe, 27 times, 100% no. Right! Then, I'd prefer study refer anti-maskers psychopaths opposed antisocial. Thanks book recommendation.👌 Thanks geography lesson. forgot world consisted US PRC. Utah moms agree. love game. Murder moms. We're talking Jelly Belly Pritzker here. He's right side history left side history. Ohhhhh  two highest days Sweden 8th 15th April 115 deaths 2 days. 11th 16th recorded deaths 100 days 80s-90s mostly, average worst week around 120 maybe around 100-ish so.  grandfather died flu couple years ago vaccines hand washing weren’t enough. flu may “less deadly” it’s still deadly thousands still die year. death still death matter died from. shouldn’t virus less deadlier another (for small minority population anyway) it’s important. guess death doesn’t matter didn’t die COVID older people COVID dystopian era we’re living deserve cared coddled.

Anyways agree everything else said. Appreciate productive conversation. Thread: Russia

Comment section: Trump trump trump  Agreed. know, need multiple negatives within two weeks arriving leave quarantine, first test arrive bring government provided transport quarantine center. feel like mandatory comment post:

""This business get control. get control we'll lucky live it.""

A fictional line that's maybe little real days. Given fact symptomatic people motivated go get test, think it’s reasonable assume another 40 60% carrying/spreading without getting tested. Right. October 27th virus raging country: won’t hear week? Wiped news? That’s full crazy demented notion. doesn’t even make sense. Within week reading people dying Covid. :(. It’s going bigger news election. I’m saying wasn’t bad, different definitions epicenter. Hidalgo El Paso similar populations, Hidalgo ~3x number deaths. Right, deadly certain people, argument population deadly average person stocking supplies like end world like original comment suggested ive heard exact thing family members infuriating know couple people healthcare workers believe things. incomprehensible. go Texas work next month.

&amp;#x200B;

I bought pack 3M N95 go Texas well face shield. California feel safe enough wearing regular slip mask. Masks help stop spread alone. Canadian study looked mask mandates measures concluded mask mandates could reduce cases third.

You friends suffering human inability intuitively grasp probability. Here's nice [Scientific article it. case, think maskd working must equal full protection - them, conclusion work, you, there's anomaly explains it. Neither right - reduce probability infection, brains refuse accept extrapolate either 100% 0%. ? be...

Condolenulations? Actually would also would help french budget. always reason doubt, absence thorough supporting evidence. Another name ""scientific method"". rate feel like running people get new cases Yeah. 😔

Time start stocking up. 500K weak, we're Americans expect less 1M week later winter! understanding RNA tells body make virus, sort ""make it"" immune system says ""we're attack ahhh"" begins immune response, correct?

My concern RNA interacts bodies guess, understanding I'm watching videos scientist work field get grasp I'm unsure vaccine comes out. Tbf either way. gonna long winter. mind politics. ton overweight liberals well. Check thread. fellow China simps already mass downvoted it. people act like night much busier daytime social establishments like bars clubs? Looks. Like peaked 3.48%. days peak 2%. Time state like larger NSW peaked 30 cases day. Vic 3 days 0 cases row ""I'll prove cause research things clearly enough"" person want clarify ""proof"" posting unsure facts like survival rate Twitter. makes say it’s incomplete data? Genuinely curious, want make sure I’m reading correctly. 

And yes course active hospitalizations important, declining ongoing hospitalizations important well. Task failed successfully 🎃 Upvoted Nearly stuff public knowledge China end January; shutdown, masking, disinfection, physical distance, contact tracing, aggressive testing, thorough isolation, thorough quarantining arrivals close contacts, potential aerosol transmission, etc. China is...not information blackhole. sounds bit insulting actually surprised February average SCMP reader informed key govt officials developed countries combat virus. God hope Ah yes, Swedish approach. Head first volcano. we’re page here, everyone aware thing matters percent positive right? Cases per day indisputably irrelevant. Percent positive indication  generic multivitamin, containing appropriate amounts vitamin magnesium, work well two different supplements?

it depends mean appropriate suppose. multivits contain enough vitamin D, usually somewhere 1000iu, deficieint normally enough get need go. take multivit + like 2k-3kiu vitamin extra top good go. need get blood checked doctor, need experiment bit much take get levels 30-70ish. 

As magnesium, depend 1) amount vitamin 2) form. (1) look daily advised amount get range much take, usually somewhere around 600mg good think please double check. (2), form takes affect bioavailability magnesium (fancy way saying whether vitamin form easily used accessed body). 

If magnesium form magnesium citrate magnesium glycinate, good go. forms like chelated form ""oxide,"" shown inferior terms bioavailability would recommend getting source form body better use. Otherwise sort throwing empty vitamins body body shrug try best able use much it. mRNA vaccines make actual virus. explicitly encoding slightly modified version spike protein, protein relevant immune responses built against. bears mutations compared wild virus impact surfaces shows immune system, cripple can't function, lock 'pre-fusion' configuration configuration immune reaction actually helps. official statement. know dead received vaccine not. rumors. wooshed homie, point making? vaccine widely used Russia? number cases growing despite first country approved vaccine available. greater Vitamin leads greater immune function (up point), something like linear relationship two variables. Low Vitamin mean low immunity lower Vitamin means lower immunity (up point). According people I've talked essentially cause swedes wear mask, would wear one infected outside. see thing avoid, since likely infected (in eyes). Nope it'll 0 November 4th. Wake sheeple.

*Unfortunately mandatory /s here* Yes, seriously. someone wanted argue should’ve pulled second inning MLB made aware yesterday’s test inconclusive, see that. Maybe inconclusive tests common think bubble like month positives. see sides there.

Celebrating teammates posing team picture utterly stupid. positivity rates tested around 1-2% know numbers Vic Australia matters too. Also calculate tell infection rate r0 publicly right 1.20 target go lower 1. really well controlled here. look like? Cornpop Jackson??? ain't black Jack! I'll punch daughter straight mouth. would love go Singapore ( already Hong Kong loved it) Seems like good investment, I’ll pay 32k it.

Source: president Venezuela impression late November date comes timeframe enough safety data apply EUA, efficacy data coming potentially early late October definitely safety data. True...

Edit: know getting topic swear God many us Hongkongers want China anything us Let lesson southern neighbours, two months' time. 

We're already fighting zombie horde here. Somewhat unsuccessfully. must nice. I’m NYC. Eight close friends disease March early April (all survived, sick while), 1 300 people died covid. needless say almost everyone city takes precautions seriously. source two months comment? ass count.

It's even longer Mike Pompeo's claim there's truth Pompeo would jumping now.  Australia Chinese government getting along moment sure Hong Kong included Australian bubble It’s side denying first make political. it’s fucking stupid see 99.9% quoted again.

Where figure come from?

Also, watch mortality rate America rise health care resources found overwhelmed. good case point would watch El Paso Texas next weeks. Also assuming administration obstruct retaliation getting voted out. True enough.

We needed rapid testing, screening, contact tracing back *MARCH*. Trying implement measures now, even regards one aspect economy, air travel, asking much government seem give fuck. Preemptive self-defense. any. ummmm interest medical debt absolute value 29k. ""Seems be"". literally challenge recovered SARS patients second time virus longer exists humans. effectiveness response can't even measured. measure indicators unknown usefulness.

You virally triggered auto-immune response ""robust lasting"" instance, that's good thing. 

Tell brigade, guys try proving need vaccine something? purpose disinformation? goal? really wonder goes people's heads this. fucking minor inconvenience people treat like kind human rights violation. We're different Denmark given mandatory busses restaurants took short time getting used seeing using masks places. tomorrow masks mandatory public places I'm sure fine. big deal ☺️ Everyone seemed given taking precautions.


Insanity. Haha first sentence. Education always shit Germany. little money yeah give like week taking see feeling, can't hurt.

Also may want look different types fiber, obviously eat lot insoluble fiber, may want incorporate soluble fiber too? there's plenty info around internet stuff. much insoluble fiber def cause constipation may much recent times, never know. also stress water intake well. Should. change immune system works, shown antigens. Yea never said told us last week it'd ready. would lie? Good question. Washing ones hands obviously preventive need mentioned. Melania Trump says: 'Fuck Christmas!' take guns bullets fund.

On federal scale leave Singapore Hong list common restrictions here, “lockdown” Blood blood god Check drive thru voting. I'm Houston area able drive car vote Makes much sense.  wonderful time year...for COVID-19. 

Seriously, plan go Thanksgiving Christmas outside household everyone favor test/isolate after. lockdown... minor restrictions. People continue drink outside home groups. Adults continue spread disease work buildings several offices canteens... Pupils continue spread schools. Kids drive everything kitas kindergartens. medical professors... physicians believe mask wearing strictly political hospitals using pandemic opportunity make money. admit would likely die covid become infected advanced age. easily beyond early 70's.

I see masks politicized they're still method reduce risks. Imagine convincing whole family seatbelts hoax

I hate comparison seatbelts.

If someone want wear seatbelts, part problem. someone wear masks spreads disease everyone else's problem. extremists receiving money NED, sure.

Just like extremists middle east celebrating death counts western powers. Yeah bad everything else terrible.

Stop lionizing Bush. Gore would MUCH better president thats low bar.

Kyoto.
Protocols.  vaccine election sadly two different things be. America... didn’t know cricket popular US antigenic drift issue unrelated influenza virus has. far virus changed antigenically.

It flu virus. family viruses. People need realize this. always tell get lazy skip days pain starts creeping back in.

This literally impossible. takes much, MUCH, *MUCH* longer go non-deficient deficient vitamin (and even longer start seeing symptoms.) Vit fat soluble, even take 7-14 days worth time rather every day, difference.

Not saying deficiency vitamin also bone health, careful correlations like (probably placebo effect, can't also cause physical symptoms). read comment?

Vitamin surely beneficial effect immunity. low Vitamin mean low immunity. Vitamin like add-on, something extra immune system. level body indicator immune level. function body lies elsewhere people? It’s like 40%, that’s enough fuck thing everyone Sure entire northern half NJ part New York metro area imaginary lines map still real political borders CoMrAdE

Doubling pretending I’m bot doesn’t change fact people NEVER go negative tests every infectious disease every time travel. It’s absolutely ludicrous  sell essential oils something? forced wear pants refuse wear little peace cloth mouth nose. What's wrong people? hate people including family? basically 40,000 people trial haven’t 32 cases yet? bad ‘Rona doesn’t kill ignorant. Putin average intelligence best. Considering described mechanisms virus erodes immune response thus far require live replicating virus reason doubt vaccine create stronger longer lasting immune response natural infection. multibillion dollar question, Rupert Murdoch family pandemic. Whatever they're really think going opposed media assets saying. also concluded water wet. really hope one, Sweden included catches them. I'm kind new subreddit. reason everything BNO Desk's Twitter? decided trustworthy news source pandemic something? back manufacturing middle class needs happen.

How would this? Please remember automation eliminated many rote manufacturing jobs. Luckily Supreme Court would never overturn Obamacare. Oh wait... started tests generally healthy adults. sure works for, doesn’t wreck, everyone else. Since want smartass already shown ability mutate effective spreading. also RNA virus prone mutations likely need yearly vaccine opposed DNA viruses like ones mentioned. may mutate slower flu still will. Mutations unpredictable. Order magnitude. Sweden’s death rate per capita order magnitude Greater neighbors. Sweden’s current infection rate order magnitude neighbors. No, levels ""active"" antibodies slowly approach zero without infection. That's would huge waste resources body keep making antibodies every single pathogen exposed lifetime. undermine masks social distancing. Every time he’s asked it, says favor. Saying Trump anti masker anything effect distortion lie. give masks free Trump rallies. 

He’s right says America turning tide, since American drug companies release vaccine drugs. Death rates 85% America Americans self regulating complying. 
Trump looking full half glass. Biden tries scare you’ll vote him.  possible, likely present ramping deaths 60's seems disprove understand it?

The main takeaway spring peak actual cases 10-15 times confirmed numbers. Meaning 10000 cases per day worst it. think claim court ""no reasonable person would think facts"" something like that.

In words, shovel whatever shit like, entertainment? Right? seems tests running too. felt sick yesterday literally find place tests available place insanely long wait. Obama already said...its cliff. Well, much freedom dead disabled. Better people. quick enough guess. doubt we’re going catch Czech Republic speed. would fascinating disproved common belief. probably pretty obvious people... especially testing remaining limited (ppe known presumed positive covid cases higher others, don’t know... goes risk). Science isn’t political opinion. highly misleading. We’re simply tests counting one person multiple cases. work healthcare get tested three times week. co-worker tests positive, every test test positive counts another case. 

Please note discounting fact people America still refuse wear masks even acknowledge Covid-19 exists. That’s like saying random water bottling company agrees send 100 bottles water Flint Michigan three dollars each. Oh yay MLB players rep dumbest lot. Thankfully worry that. Sure are. relaxed lot shows.

This truly awful another lockdown put place soon. Hopefully people disciplined slow January February. Yes I’ve read thought memory cells inevitably produce least low level antibodies present, antibodies crucial element immunity, especially fast replicating agents, although diseases exist antibodies play less important role.

But expert, so... guys ask America send extra doses. half Americans refuse get thinks it’s full mercury, dead baby fetuses, rfid tracking chips cancer. many Russians kill US recently vs many Americans killed Americans US.

LOL hilarious. many Russians US killed versus many Russians killed Russians Russia? many Americans killed UK citizens UK versus many UK Citizens kill UK citizens UK? 

See dumb point is?

What you? 14 spewing daddy's talking points? let adults talk go back asking dad great great motherland Russia Big Bad UN came decimated failing Union. MLB worst admin sports. couldn’t even punish cheaters world series. You’re saying we’re first? witnessing maybe studied years incredible example natural selection stupidity gullibility. It’s enough one every six federal workers. Much less civilians represent serve. Hardly drop bucket family history schizophrenia. one current condition. Pretty much lockdown since June, 4 weeks enough. 

The government using 14 day average cases determine lift certain restrictions take account lag time life cycle virus. France get control 2 live cycles virus. That’s get information from! They’re great podcast anyone sees really consider listening. Don’t let long run times intimidate you, put listen long like. I'm millionaire. mean, work paycheck-to-paycheck, I'm working it. great accomplishment become millionaire. speaking thoughts big reason think lot country going shift closer back normal March-spring range COVIDs secondary problems/effects kind starting overtake virus itself, like really find balance manageable able things like kids school etc. thoughts obviously. seem losing sleep thread lmao. pathetic realistic solution people would tolerate comfortable level government overreach. pandemic serious threat public health, yes, prudent response. Seasonal flu? No. indeed dangerous thing vulnerable, significant enough danger general public warrant intrusive measure. party advocated measures seasonal flu would unelectable. That's reality. I'd far happier something workable getting rid mask stigma point many people sick decide wear them....that significant victory aiming. TL;DR. Yes, lockdown perfectly. lower number new cases per day therefor lower burden hospitals therefor keep going broad-use vaccine avail.. Waves/lockdowns work like light switch, work like dimmer.

WallOT:

Yes, young folks gathering homes, old people (high risk group) stupid things escape house arrest (walking stuffed toy dog comes mind, Italy spring).

There asymptomatic carriers outside. majority follow rules therefor number infections per day get contaminate surroundings time nobody around pick virus there. get sick one virus particle, ""the dose makes poison"", make sure get exposed time.

Warning! amateur oppinion!!: studies hint large droplets (which see) contain 500 particles, animal studies needed 7k-200k particles different animals show symptoms. manage pick couple large droplets stay home days exposure, congrats, might safe.

How else would able keep millions people save 'til summer ?

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ guys country numbers extremely low basically zero cases Victoria June. escaped returned travelers hotel quarantine program put together quickly enough focus effective disease control.

That triggered second wave state. No, common sense. SINGLE one strains mutation affects area immune system attacks virus. Hence, vaccine also targets stable spike protein work across those.

The flu unique genetic drift, basically thing need yearly vaccines against. need yearly vaccines chickenpox, measles, mumps, pertusis, etc. Flu unique regard due large amount genetic variation. COVID shown flu-like variation yet, known mutations would protected current vaccines. Like, humans lot genetic variation them, bullet brain pretty much always works...we'd evolve pretty thick skulls stop working one yet, still pretty effective. blue eyes versus green enough...aka genetic variation equal.

&amp;#x200B;

So stop acting like expert calling things common sense clearly clue ""common sense"" field looks like. think know. 

So yes: Belgium densely populated (it's basically big city green patches), lot visitors. European metropolitan areas. 

It's also true political institute complex, I'd wary point reason. lot action done managed federal government. actually last week different measures created different regions, looks like differences going smoothed less.

Our schools opened September, might something look into. We'll see upcoming holiday slows things enough. Also contact tracing still major issue: people know infected contacted days afterwards, sometimes (apart SMS message). 

Personally believe virus spread never low enough begin with. hope time measures stay strict there's internal transmission left all. we're 0 transmissions, tests used strategically slightest sign virus may appear. Yep catching Quickly seems mean look comments around sub.

“How hard deal, vaccine almost there.”

“Just wear mask distance till vaccine comes out.”

Even place known support restrictive measures, it’s still reliance vaccine.

For society large, we’ve built whole plan basically near miracle cure (so fingers crossed, twice). Side impacts restrictions, major focus vaccine. parts health, address vaccine.

Oh sure, push keep plexiglass hand washing (please people, mean come on) haven’t build culture permanent new normal, aren’t much anything improve people’s health mitigate covid risk long haul, aren’t even talking anything else survive it’s here. 

The narrative suck then. people going accept even then, it’s still different.  happen. Also, political opinion allowed sub. shows need expand access higher education, human capital lose virus invaluable cannot replaced rate need, current debt-fueled system. Incoming herd immunity Belgium? don’t time super deep dive right now. [here’s one showing CFR (case fatality rate) slipped half point since August, 3% 2.5%. go walk downtown place mask mandate, shocking many people still mask. guess one ever anything enforce it, many people bother complying. Likewise, lots people wearing incorrectly, nose poking out, pulled around chin neck ""wearing mask"" completely ineffectively. People dolts. *Europeans sitting home eating popcorn watching US probably elect idiot again* &amp;#x200B;

I able get 9 year old rapid test Monday urgent care clinic metro Texas area. taxpayers paying drug ""free charge"" Americans. vaccine shown effective several articles past months shown even effective, antibodies last.

So call publicity stunt? FYI Flu shot offered free 3(?) provinces Contrary shaming hear reddit, heavy compliance places. Europe mask mandates last several months cases ever. mask mandate, hard lockdowns spring, case numbers became minimal late May/June.

I'm denying masks anything, mostly forced distancing working. conversation coworker yesterday. Nearly verbatim. *Pikachu Face*




/S Wsco, pretty much means closing entire state haha many hospitals close shutting money issues spreading information like criminal?

The First Amendment Constitution United States. Italy Spain Germany France suffered February-May. came US. Eastern europe fully open quarentine. like spreading faster now. less people stipped soing before. 

Also, weather nothing population density holidays do. ""we can't let virus control lives"" EASTER OCTOBER. RISEN!

PEACE YOU, PLEBEIANS. There’s pay wall paragraph half. guy tested positive, mere hours later series, came celebrate maskless team??? guys got once-off $1,200 cheque, meanwhile Australia unemployed got they're unemployment rates nearly doubled campaign called Jobseeker.

For underemployed (company made x% less month month last year), companies received fortnightly stipend $1, 200 per employee called Jobkeeper.

Because Australia's payroll systems electronic automated, near impossible employers pass money employees directly. 

I literally cannot imagine anyone thought single $1,200 cheque would achieve anything meaningful. Hospitalizations deaths down. I'm concerned lack data seasonal flu diseases. going compare numbers previous years, I'm getting bit suspicious. got last blood draw yesterday. follow six months. Placebo id like think helped Sounds like Nov 4th things can, needed, go back fighting infection spread. like older arcade game. runs places score reset 0? guy presentation said might unblind study. one asked might think makes sense emergency use authorization.

I minor fatigue times barely fatigued. wondered vaccine lazy. arm sore times. Feasibility study determine banner size font: $10,000,000 It’s reporting newly published CDC study. likely lung scarring heart consistency microwaved yogurt point. He’s borrowed time saying they're actually incapable learning things like normal people, hence belong special education.

People mentally disabled, ""in special education"" put it, incapable learning. learn differently peers. consistent kind teaching reminding wear masks, distance others, wash hands properly, vast majority mentally disabled best follow guidelines. *best* people know ""in special education."" lovely, complex people inner lives, aspirations, fears, cares. Please reference pejorative. people refuse take virus seriously selfish mendacious; mentally disabled. almost everything right? Except Wuhan coverup eh? lockdown might actually fail. enough people flout rules enough people go protesting it, fail change anything. lot people super pissed lockdowns want another one matter what. Hi everyone! Hope everyone's healthy staying safe! currently grandparents self-isolating basement returned abroad. wondering safe turn heating system recent days quite chilly. since returned fear could unknowingly spread coronavirus around house. help would appreciated! got tested CT last month picking nose q tip seconds envy hilarious, sorry successful man. I'm sure worked hard got super unlucky right? 10 week lockdown it? doubt 4 weeks France. Yeah no. goalpost shifting isn’t going work society. Let’s try make goal vaccinate risk people healthcare workers. commissioner delivered speech podium completely maskless. Turner's test inconclusive night game results last night's tests come back middle game. MLB two breakouts occur Marlins Cardinals locker rooms. league also promoted postseason environment ""bubble"" despite nothing sort compared bubble NBA had.

I need go on. MLB reaping sow. Fitting league punish players involved 2017 Astros cheating scandal, one biggest scandals history game, refused revoke title trophy ""just piece metal"".

The state today's MLB Commissioner's Office breeds negligence. hope least increases mask usage flu season times like Asian countries people sick public wear mask.

I think even that's enough. hear Asian country flu season example often, Asia, masks *optional*, even though lots people make choice wearing accord.

Here America, we're resistant change, going take lot mere *recommendations* encouraging widespread adoption mask usage. about, say, *requiring* masks every flu season? way, we'd stricter Asian countries, order account reduced tolerance accepting mass reform. ""And we're even close finished yet.""

Problem finished it, virus isn’t finished us. probably covid aircraft carrier extra unaware irony charge reckless endangerment attempted murder would better. It’s hilarious shut government 35 days costing millions go without pay checks wall never finished &amp; cost US tax payers billions 

But can’t national mask mandate try lockdown country, working governors.. need president who’s America. states vote him. He’s unworthy office. Darwin's law. works. Elections useless politicians sides aisle actual problem. pandemic rages next four years hope people begin understand parties criminally negligent actually dealing (like using relief citizens emergency political cudgel instead actually protecting people). Assuming country four years. really need written? think 2 year old would already know this. know you, I've never ever heard pro athlete introduced scholastic merit first. ""Hailing tiny town Nowhere, W. Va, Davy Doogood comes us 4.0 gpa and--my personal favorite stat--3240 days school without absence. spare time, Davy fires particle collider built searches new elements place wall science greats. there's more!

Like said, pro athletes known intellectual skills. first able explain ""dialectical materialism"" is. *""He's hurting right people!""*  best government Yeah think need away rule particular situation. believe people fixate 6% number good faith actors. support schools open 

I don’t support narrative schools don’t spread Covid. They’re largely untested asymptomatic population think second wave kind inevitable, given past pandemics shown, also taking account human nature. People got relaxed forgot pandemic, took summer holidays, forgetting winter coming... I'm even sure sort media diet could lead person conclusion like would someone pay money get med card don’t to? get point. point people Newark go southern jersey demographics. Type -A group people enjoy food A. type B group people enjoy food B dislike going Type neighborhoods dont like people live there. 
That New Jersey nutshell. 
This isnt like NY people city go Long Island dine people city go upstate dine in.
Northern Southern Jersey like following: people Scarsdale(majority jewish population) trying go Astoria(almost latino population) dine driving 30 mins so. wont happen quote I’ll remember long know critical dilemma need keep mind safety quality healthcare systems point there's nothing bad solutions that's point reaching apt die factor 31? sure? Pilot studies precede funding larger ones. Peer review usually 4-8 month process.

In public health crises, always time wait conclusive evidence. means provisional approval remdesvir large randomized controls come back showing ineffective, that's bad thing. best evidence hand.

If one make case public, one would use experts like Mt. Sinai's Center Post-COVID Care, Penn Medicine's Post-COVID Assessment Recovery Clinic. important thing make clear Covid-19 resolve full-recovery, death, there's significant chance serious long term health cognitive problems road. matter letting elderly near death pass away. story barely received mainstream coverage.

If takes persuade public public health mitigation measures necessary, benefit well, willing explain evidence hand (including limitations). can’t see article since I’m europe, someone give tl;dr? Yes Yup, already told wife get intent seeing family holidays cases going go fucking roof starting Halloween. looked facts Chinese ""cover up"", reduce possible timeframe could happened (from whole January according Western media, days late December) realized active cover make sense all.

I'm sure come conclusion take time seriously look it.

As starting point, here's [a reputable New England Journal Medicine. Look [Figure shows Chinese response cases weird pneumonia started increase. note first death confirmed directly linked coronavirus happened [on January 41 confirmed weird pneumonia cases notifying late December.

*Anybody* bit research beyond spurted Western mass media propaganda come (un)easy conclusion: blaming China attempt distract governments failed response crisis. insulin still $1,400 month? Oh, Trump made cheap water. Gamergirl bathwater cheap, melted iceberg water cheap though. No. officially wrong. could taken correction said thanks moved on. displaying behavior condemning. judging entire state ""less yourself"" exaggerate point. That's ignorant laughable. LIES! Can't sniff crime nose covered. saying admittedly problematic b/c case lineage, course case yelling fire theater even though quote comes it... rather espionage act case.

But false statement fact exception first amendment many cases, hence sorts examples find quite pickle lying particularly govt officials. Deliberate lies imperil others lead prosecutions, example take swatting. keep hearing understand thinking. 7. things weird. Well gargle straight oil.... I'm one thoose people.

I seem remember pointing among 20% people infected Sweden ment 2 000 000 infected.

Spreading thoose evenly march april ment something like 30 000 cases day. Obviously since spread work like true number suffice proove point.

(I'm saying 20% Swedes infected. absolutely obvious everyone 700 cases per day April.) UK people getting infected purpose test vaccine? that's called GO DOCTOR specialized dispensary. dispensaries Colorado largely recreational. try pull whataboutisms even apply. getting large dose hospitalized drastically reduces severity disease mortality. yet, public health officials silent campaigning people supplement vitamin would cheap effective.

Source?

I know clinicians would really happy could find something worked severely decreased disease severity patients land hospitals. I'm sure they'd love know this, many doctors actually enjoy watching hundreds people passing care die.

But nah, apparently they're evil actively want patients die. 

What fucking moronic conspiracy theory, ashamed yourself. Oh absolutely agree, many people would actually adhere new lockdown, believe true, Boris went lockdown threat France get shit together, France say thing again, Boris might choice.

And everyone voted really see clusterfuck brought power, already realised error judgement made. Excellent post.

Similar studies show helpful masks are, data important. Wow, we're already setting record new daily cases even full-on flu season yet. Wait people get together Thanksgiving Christmas, restaurant patios close (or cover tents). crappy $1,200 check million years ago impact anymore.


The check even main issue. additional unemployment money eviction protection important. Especially winter. old fuckers DC going literally leave people freezing cold worried might give needy much money. TBH maybe shouldnt talking soon vaccine be?

I mean see internet people latch onto every word, people convinced vaccine month, people using reason nothing.

Fauci's sunny vaccine proclamations making pandemic worse. first time got memory.

Buehler? Buehler? Maybe telling people pin hopes vaccine. Public health untrustworthy right now. Fauci made worse imo, trying land plane... mr funny! Get funny reward funny fuckingnotfunnyanymore.com school gives us option quarantine home live far :( course can. Many decide eat large amounts candy holiday festivities, example. certainly health-related decision. doesn't. Maybe took basic advanced (and learned already basic) immunology lessons university even news question? media pretending news? 

We've clearly seen little people get reinfected. feel ok mild cough headache. I’m pretty certain got friend whose house went watch football past weekend. point, agree.  Damn, remember hearing we'd hit herd immunity initial lockdowns cases really low? wrong people were.

Wrong, wrong, wrong. Tens hundreds thousands people die Europe winter 'herd immunity' morons bleating since summer pretend never said anything all.  earth “ending pandemic” midst pandemic even mean? It’s longer national emergency? Despite millions ACTIVE cases? significant percentage population wanting alter daily lives resistant government attempts mandate control measures difficult enforce wide scale country actually low number law enforcement personnel relative population. US around half many police per capita Europe. aren’t. You’re supposed die quietly. 

America many people number decent jobs have. Rather retrain people push good jobs, we’ve chosen let people die. 

Right now, whole lot people preferred capitalist political policies (not allowed mention political parties here) realizing don’t matter either. 

It makes perfect sense, long look lens unrestrained capitalism. That’s logic, logic lens, makes perfect sense. happens abandon millions people sink swim, ignores mostly sink. way decades. We'll get em next time. talking yourself. get away keyboard bit man. remember live France, dont leave house Ish.

We need directed access higher education.

No point making women’s studies majors taxpayer dime short nurses doctors.

ASVAB college people getting matched list majors meet talents counties needs.

Private school, want, you’re govt foot bill, fill need.

And thanks BLS know needs. Pretty cheap area Midwest. Pretty impressive group practically immune hoax. forget churches. Pray Covid away. disturbing sad. nope. experience people ultra sensitive vitamin deficiency go through. dr confirmed uncommon, thing. similar issue. We’re coming #1 spot. America outdone Make sure also getting zinc B12. Higher flu least 🤷🏻 Yeah I'm specifically talking gargling essential oil. Seems unpleasant. assuming grandparents live parent provide childcare.

So, one household high risk one wants live without precautions? 

You advocating high risk household either see child resign getting civic. going soon enough Well, clearly people Sweden ignoring measures too... seeing Sweden suffering second wave Tegnell said happen.  amount stay 100k day. get 100k day amount continue rise. infected faster number rise. Unless something done it. present continuous tense. ""ing"" classic example ...

Present Continuous. ""I playing tennis."" makes sense. extreme right wing put lot time effort brainwashing large number Americans, become delusional paranoid. GOP right Serious question, joking. come people focused 6% number covid deaths without comorbidities? looked side way, percentage experiencing stress solely covid restrictions? Yep big parts Europe 20+ % positivity rate Sweden steady increase 1 4 % last weeks. cannot compare numbers all. Many countries Europe reached limit testing capactity. looks like 2021 mask free anytime soon. Differentiation patients definite diagnosis (25 65) COVID-19 non-COVID-19 possible 80% 81.5% accuracy Edinburgh Dortmund respectively (sensitivity/specificity 82.4%/75%; area-under-the-receiver- operator-characteristic [AUROC] 0.87 95% CI 0.67 1) Dortmund (sensitivity / specificity 90%/80%; AUROC 0.91 95% CI 0.87 1)

It would interesting see comparison available testing methods comparing sensitivity, specificity, invasive-ness result time. work appreciated. happen, depending Nov 3rd goes could late February. many folk way late. done priority election Republicans took wait see method Trump went full extortion mode. Getting control :( time, everyone know recovered relatively quickly. Maybe took better care themselves. think that's exactly it. exhaustion careful. 

While understand it, definitely solution make things worse. lot people die people *need* go eat. 

I know someone parents traveling multiple states holidays. They're unhealthy af too. need keep asses home want last holidays family. 

People can't make sacrifices. short term thinking. Infused CBD extra Vit D. Ok that’s folks, hope enjoyed pandemic tegrity special 🤮 Thanks advance bravery. Sad. recommend clicking it. might enjoy life little more. reminds exchange recently 3 year old nephew...


Me: potty?

*3yo: (awkwardly squatting) No.*

Me: .....Ya sure bud? 

*3yo: (not-so discreet grunts, still squatting) Look airplane!*

Me: That’s submarine. C’mon let’s go big boy potty come right back pla-

*3yo: (looking like I’m idiot, still squatting) Noooo, flies it’s airplane!*


*(Later takes post pant-shitting bath)*

Me: thought said airplane! What’s water?

*3yo: (rolling eyes, again, like I’m idiot) Aunty, it’s submarine.*



So, yeah, shit pants submarines planes will.. don’t think similar exchange Trump would go much different. read interview little further, would provide assistance universities, dire shape right now, we’re making sure we’re destroying one important sectors economy post-pandemic world. One things find absolutely shocking there’s discussion what’s happening universities, even though know leading sectors US economy tech sectors, research sectors, bio sectors, high-tech sectors. discussion pandemic recovery, talk old economy, sectors going enable us competitive future. excess death fits covid deaths? would point? Socialstyrelsen counts people died cause ""Covid"" anyway statistics. already told parents that. help bit festival respect respect dead ancestors. bad environment waste resources. I'm religious superstitious. go cemetery pay respect burning paper goods food offerings. (Literally sacrificing living's future pay ""respect"" dead. pointless. course say bluntly. want start war) seem understand. hate mask mostly political. :/ plus Asian countries people wear masks lot times especially sick. Religion excuse. political. Yes... funnily enough exact time period Tegnell supporters denied seriously reporting number cases.

Funny story changed... Damn dude, post redpilled subreddit. thinking freely place. mods get ya that!

On real though I'm pretty pissed remdesivir EUA too. MAYBE lower average hospitalization stay days, meanwhile less expensive drugs vitamin supplementation get sick may effective even better. ridiculous. people care making buck people getting sick expensive ass medicine nothing no, pandemic ends 3rd, remember? unlike US, they're actively seeking find solutions spikes surges.

So US wait 250k cases per day something? they'd applauded that? Cuz.. that's France doing. Nobody going live life without comforts pleasurable spending soften pitfalls daily monotony. I’d rather live paycheck paycheck squirrel every cent away miserable day day out. 

Money doesn’t buy happiness, living like you’re going Great Depression isn’t exactly perfect model happiness either. 

I’d argue bigger problem country overall set top down, absolutely absurd cost medical treatment. many near bankruptcy due unplanned illness without good (or any) insurance? 

People developed countries live better lower level income. know I’ve experienced firsthand. see this, going outright say read article, but, surprise. Rural areas get hit hard (or all) pandemic first started. people started traveling, road tripping RVs might've passed rural areas, possibly carrying Covid...and rural communities wearing masks extra cautious, current outbreaks make sense. What?

Distribution vaccine planned. CDC offering assistance contact tracing.

They still people specialities things. blame Democrats caving Republican demands less help. easy. Okay. 

This job. I’ve doctor twenty years. There’s way proving that, obviously, maybe five percent hospitalised patients COVID-19 strokes, strokes believed come blood changing clots easily due inflammation, measure markers like CRP ferritin - higher numbers mean inflammation mean clotting mean strokes. Ask doctors true. 

Anyway. work smallish regional hospital south west Western Australia, done almost ten years, views quite possibly representative colleagues. 

But believe job skill set. There’s intrinsic ethical component. Every job ethical component, particularly every job deals vulnerable (teaching, police, etc.) job ethical component means emergency people need you, story becomes simple. job. ethical component optional add-on like roo bar, it’s core. 

(I saying solely medical thing, medicine job know I’m talking that). 

As element compulsion - none us free, song says. lot people can’t take holidays exactly want. Several professions times would put others great risk cause great harm quit - airline pilots example springs mind. 

“Essential service” means without service people die. government’s first duty protect citizens always come first. temporarily suspending doctors leave retirement part that, life goes on. 

Obviously there’s hideous family thing able take brief period off, you’re retiring you’ve got serious illness something that’s different, Jesus Christ - want leave hospital middle pandemic glide ski fields Switzerland something, no. can’t it. Go back work. freaking job. 

Anyway - opinion only. can’t think single thing Turkish government done agree, whatever. understand they’re they’re here. 

Rant over. see Excess Deaths Covid Deaths close time Mar Oct, apparently works relatively well. Socialstyrelsen counts people ""cause death: Covid"", number bit smaller FHMs number. Well said Nice, that's international pandering political comment looking for. Exactly, that’s leader (Melbourne, Victoria) resisted consistent calls us open earlier health officials suggested. virus contained people safely spend again. Youre assuming EVERYONE gets virus. work way.

We little scenario every single year flu. less bullets. doubt panicked then. Luckily USA paid wall two countries. Also 230,000+ people closing eyes forever *because* exists  Science sorting evidence. agree, there’s different ways interpreting outcomes. raising visibility counter theory this. making determinations, sharing perspectives. I’m arguing real inequality problems country, don’t think big problem average layperson everyone reddit seems think. 

My main point comment USA shithole country now. That’s simply true. Don’t really care enough convince that, gtfo think it’s shithole. I'm Swedish med student confirm it. ICU highest level care reseved critically ill. extremely high doctor nurse patient ratio there, uncommonly one doctor two nurses per patient(obviously Covid worst). terms Covid means sick patients, need mechanical ventilation, get placed there.

Patients require oxygen mask nasal cannula placed ward necessary. People require non-invasive ventilation placed placed intermediary wards(IMA) sometimes emergency medicine wards(AVA).

But also want make clear patients Covid patients ICU may ventilator. could vasopressor treatment septic shock, carefully monitored cardiac arrest, severe burns lots unhealed skin, receiving ventricle drain due bacterial meningitis on... I'm concerned dying. chronic issues long time Lyme's disease (and may still residual problems). I'm still mentally dealing fallout.

I think people brush ""it kill you"" understand fucking devastating prolonged/permanent health issues are. still idea long term problems one, ""tail"" know has, affects young old, good indicator... get impression one reasons Victoria, Australia eager get lockdown right: Christmas rolls around bets off. virus control, bad, lost community support lockdown everyone want spend time extended families. Lots people Juarez employed El Paso. live El Paso hundreds coworkers Juarez, shutting border basically force job. That's absolutely talking about. employ trace tracking citizens. fly EU example. Election uncertainty? changed since yesterday? First generation vaccines likely grant sterilizing immunity. Hence solve problem. 
If smart resources like Chinese. Test randomly find new outbreaks grow big. Lock locally test everybody lockdown. keep impact measures local rest country open. even read listed? Way completely ignore science data. Agreed. Anyone chosen take covid seriously change views (only possible exception catch it). We're gonna dealing waves shit like till there's vaccine french, locking USA might become complicated! wait idiots society form crowd try run marathon anyway. business shouldn’t stupid enacted distancing mask wearing it’s employees.

Holy shit, though. mean like reduced capacity, social distancing, limited time spent indoors around others, things said destroying economy? ways suddenly? Well, personally March antibodies tested June... 3 months mean rapidly, know does. Also, I'm healthy pre-existing conditions, exercise 3-4 days week BMI 95th % age. China fine took seriously, continue to. Couple weeks ago tested entire city 10 million dozen cases found.

In France govt basically nothing, waits last possible minute ICUs saturate, acts suprised virus grows rapidly, hits panic button again. even half-asses leave schools open.

Can't blame poor quality information coming China time. test &amp; trace system actually works

test &amp; trace system become useless many cases, like Europe moment. liked understand logic thought much Korean need know though? It’s necessary thousands people sick. long term health impacts. essential workers get sick die unnecessarily.

Death isn’t negative here. us even care elderly people don’t want die unnecessarily simply old. aren’t selfish want send old people die like Sweden.

I’ve active sub months. posts asking national mask mandates every day. Even were, wearing mask like wearing shirts shoes eat out. It’s health concern.

Refusing wear mask selfish. stay home won’t wear mask. - masks schools
- masks sports facilities (keEp 2M DistAncE)

no shit sherlock gets us second wave

The Gesundheitsämter so-called Hygienekonzepte approve fucking disgrace. one stopping locking down! ask, you’re streets behind Taxes. contempt older people West vs. respect Asia may explain lot. Europoors lot free time us US. would take 3 days she'd need least 2 hotel stops, plus food gas restroom breaks entire way. still think driving safer things slap face everyone else taking seriously - mention essential workers risking lives people lost loved ones already.

You tell twice, i'm agreement. love sister incredibly selfish every aspect life done nothing guilt us entire year. point view, nobody taking seriously. friends going home, coworkers going home, cousins going home. close friend's mom cancer still going home without quarantine sister feels like we're asking much Yea!!! poverty everyone! really wish joke well. cannot believe real life. favorite summer concert?

The ones I've playing goblet drums. must understand normal Korea western world. 

Incorrect. US many ""western"" countries established precedent measures Spanish Flu back early 1900s. legal precedent legal right so.

Your people dumbasses. lower eyes feel appropriate amount shame instead arguing people actual functioning countries. They'd right hate us, could done five months ago stuck guns.  Buy toilet paper.  chance control back April.

How anyone thinks Trump Administration good job damn mind. kill last remaining restaurents. Press f doubt  old sick vaccinated, donezo. I'm really, really worried widespread opposition taking vaccine. America already huge issue anti-vax movement, compounded politicized COVID become. intellectually dishonest counterargument hinging creation grossly hyperbolic strawman order frame statements way that's difficult disagree with.

If think people encouraging United States ""weld people homes,"" ""take away freedoms eternity,"" serious issue comprehension interpreting current situation, due respect. went football game halftime someone walked M16 fired 150 shots crowd. Would anything protect yourself? Would bring family game? Would say, hey, maybe try stop guy? would say, ""what's worry, 150 bullets shot crowd"". 

And really worse that. like 1000 bullets 150 kill, still tons people left various injury's needs treatment potential life long impacts. kind person says “if people dying thousands, it?” contain virus protect economy well essential workers.

Who wants give easily? can’t roll die months. Link doc? Nationwide crap even less please don’t downplay local variations, far closing indoor dining. Certainly level enforcing hour outdoor time hardly insignificant.

Mobility data California shows dramatic change months -40-55%, New York &amp; Mass even -50-65%. get money from? friends beer work, 

In Denver, can, wearing mask 6 foot distancing. 

I'd rather not. live area employment already scarce, among population financially geographically stranded - value human health/life much consideration employers. future startling divide life expectancy rural urban/suburban people United States next decade tell tale - anyone bothers, cares look. meanwhile germany starting next week restaurants/bars closed, take away allowed Nah, never said that. gotten worse expected since 2016 though, real concern. Culturally, too. much divide complete lack civil discourse (both parties guilty). Look snarky reply example lol. Chances I'll stay states, always good jump ship option, that's sure. people cherrypick data say virus nothing, people thing saying literal end world.  wrong, feel like true sustainable outlook exist vacuum like 90% life.

 us (literally, most. think like 70-80% people live urban urbanized areas based last census) live areas really easy go walk, drive, whatever see tons issues America grown last decades know look. want community minded perform civic duties citizens nation, think taking hard look ways consistently shortchange citizens neighbors. Whether wealth inequality, blatant casual racism, destruction environment, unsustainable increases rent home values, homelessness, education, number issues, hard look around sometimes say yourself, ""For talk America great, sure seems like could lot better."" Sure, we're, average, better countries people world grateful privileges exist, also looking improve everyday. 

I dont necessarily agree we've reached point nation there's turning back dont think fault people exhausted daily effort remain optimistic struggle better nation. Lots places world better suit individuals' needs US people leave take care psyche, really loss nation seem often take note of. enough people hide among ... now, you’re sheep, way better chance hiding. Also save everyone says ""there's 99.8% survival rate"" whatever number is. 

Surviving =/= coming full health. covid could cripple rest life technically survive. sure trying show me. 

Swedes walking around fairly normal happy life right restrictions. Compare situation places dive harsh winter lockdowns.

And GDP loss, course *everybody* took hit. course export market going get hit trade partners commit lockdown harakiri.

But look Canadian province Quebec, similar Sweden paper vital statistics (population , geography, urbanisation, social medicine, ""caring population"", etc etc).

Big difference Quebec locked *hard* Sweden stayed open.

The result? number fatalities (about 6000), Quebec almost 15% GDP loss 2020Q2/Q3 could point many factors make things worse America, like overweight first 6 weeks strict enough winter. Vic going elimination open states. restaurants saw didn’t give damn. laudable exceptions their. lot servers mask covering nose, faceshilds on. Also blatantly letting patrons without masks...

So no, totally see need close again. Middle high schools need go virtual, like come people. stricter enforcement. Partial lockdown. Maybe reupload box cover graph going haha  course masks work day day, wear mask. one brain arguing masks. 

I actually way, already do. soon turn phone computer off, problems literally disappear me. Couldn’t care less who’s president. 

You frame like it’s bad thing, yeah, ignorance amazing. Watching youtube videos bad trump racist America doesn’t help all, fuck problems see impacting people around day day life. I’m politician fix stupid ass problems. Click 7 day moving average. went level 3 lockdown weeks back cases dropping past 7 days so. Cases began rise opened back up, everywhere.

And schools still open. deflation, folks. soon pre-election stimulus table, predictable outcome. C'est parti! best, next announcement Haha. aw man, europe well guys gotta steal show again. 

hold oxygen tanks, easily hit 10x ur numbers. least testing lot. that's entire reason. Thanks. stockpiling though, surely. must cheaper (and permanent) vaccinate people lockdown lasts longer.

Maybe really doses, convinced safety yet.  Agree. there's something going wrong American evangelicals, mean applies religion globally. 

In Canada, parties ends political spectrum approximately equal support churchgoers, even Liberals (centre left) requiring charities sign pro-choice statements wanted unrelated student wage subsidies.

And Christians churches played major, major role overturning right-wing Apartheid rulers, rebuilding fairer new South Africa. Big 10 picked helluva time start back. SEC ACC others started C19 low ebb. Plus Wisconsin fire  Perhaps I'm crazy though.

You're not. sub loves hyperbole.  problem ~40% people country zero interest types amendments would needed enable federal government impose lockdown, making impossible get congress almost 4yr old lot changes. Like incredibly short temper, clingy, etc used independent laid back. He's school Paris starting better, I'm glad see staying open. school small seems good handle disinfecting, kids apart activities, outside time, teachers wearing masks, etc I'm hopeful things alright.

Earlier year moved Paris week first lockdown movers move personal belongings lockdown even get internet cable set-up. hell earth wish upon anyone 3yr old toys, familiar things, real entertainment aside boxes food play grocery, lol. countries world ""privacy right"" wear mask outside home. lie laws. That's precisely what's happening. Well business shouldn’t stupid enacted distancing mask wearing it’s employees

Oops. One guy went Washington D.C. attend anti-mask rally refused wear mask properly. refused even tested covid. everyone else was. identifiable trend across country, sure I’d acknowledge potential problem risk.

...73k cases later. that's *with* ""shutdown"". see it? literally logical conclusion highly contagious virus makes people sick work, even die.  Good one. Right...

Let’s talk China.

How treat ethnic Muslims borders?

Exactly.

Fuck troll. continue

useless knockdown Shocker group affected health wise least social/economic aspect would less inclined take measures. care homes UK (as I'm sure elsewhere) got absolutely ravaged virus. One major high-death areas. think they're still closed outside visitors here, even now. Pretty insane France nationwide lockdown leave open IMO. living Illinois looking neighboring states (esp. Iowa Wisconsin) finger tugging shirt collar. say *all* politicians bad unable compromise bill. CARES act, inability exposes selfishness sides. That's good news, offer observations : friends Canada work home currenlty, none family France dispite approriate jobs this. also reflected higher education : university Canada already announced distance-learning april 2021, well farther governement measure require, universities France operating announcement tonights measures. expect throwaway account? opening. Regeneron inc found regeneron© works Regeneron inc funded study  believe numbers, among worst though (infection rates per-capita deaths). pretty disappointing. infection rate Vietnam something like 2500 times less infection rate, incredible.

Bar hopping winter best. need jacket 1 5 degree breeze refreshing.  126th Marathon? Sadly even Biden office tomorrow, damage done. Masks political even national mandate, 40% population *still* mask up. Talking media internet convinced average person major problems need pay attention deal right now, that’s case. Nah, anti expansion oppressive regime. universities

This might smart. Teenagers spread better children study home. No, many people treated way. NY lockdown strict Europe paper practice many people treated same. learned tough lessons. last 24 hours Iowa, reported 1891 new cases 5321 tests conducted. anybody backdating stat manipulating state doing, that's 35.54% positivity rate. also let work home possible watching kids makes hard hell popularity anything? People elect Senators also elect Presidents. Presidents nominate SC Justices Senate confirms them. SC Justices chosen people. 

Also, ask struggling American would rather sh\*\*\* deal gives 1200 USD today better deal gives 2000 USD February think would prefer?

Pragmatism thrown window parties ""own"" opposition. negative impact shutting business already harm virus many people. Continue shutting business homeless huge issue. That’s Florida went reducing restrictions early on. Fixing annoy bots...

This. parallels handoff 2008 perfect means, ""it'll hurt certain states"" versus ""the economy crash take over"" among things telling. bill benefits populace indiscriminately benefit Republicans, incumbent. Democrats choose that, rather target large part HEROES act specifically Democrat leaning groups. Whether choice deliberate can't say, result bill unpalatable Republican majority Senate.

As said, Democrats could gone repeat CARES bill, choose to. see particularly caring general citizenry, want benefits voting base. oh god can't serious ahahaahahahahaha actually sad pathetic someone far left thinks China seriously good country r/sino fuck trying paint china positive light.

thank making cry laughing hard trying make delusional post (for months) goal keep manageable vaccine, arrive soon; likely last lockdown

oh sweet summer child rise amount higher within days. Either option requires restrictions freedoms one group want. 

If solution virus requires authoritarianism real acceptable solution. use website (Google.com) look statistics matter yourself. bait. laughing fact you’re another idiot American thinks know better doctors. Well, winter coming Still half way herd immunity, we're generous. ... Allowing people hang outside completely defeat lockdown's purpose Yup, indoor spaces need restrictions / closures. Outside good, fresh air sunlight important. Viral transmission risks very, low. Sure gather massive crowds hug/kiss people speak closely them, walking past sidewalk saying hello going cause healthcare systems fail. stubborn people must congregate bars restaurants homes causing this, well schools DAMN sure that, probably certain workplaces. completely wrong one. need study biology. whole narrative lockdowns they'd snuff virus

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Michigan Nothing changed then. bad. actually right. got confused referred mekanisk ventilation ventilatorbehandling. device called respirator. Apologies. Myocarditis big word people like know long crossing take know San Diego- Tijuana border take hours.  though, especially America safety net. country like Norway Germany know everything falls apart still money food housing delivered dignity. America programs far punitive. feel deep sympathy anyone torn risk health health around stay afloat. That's shitty then. solution this. still 80% market look at. sure going this. It’s relative. He's troll comes threads doom gloom. speculation, yet data phase 3 trials vaccine efficacies whether provide sterilizing immunity. Code “ending COVID-19 lockdowns”.   Yes, almost so-called ""Superspreading"" events private gatherings straight illegal partys, I'm mistaken. cost money pales comparison cost covid.

Does it? even talking about???????????????? season Republicans trash America's economy again! expense lives lost fuckin mook. Mass-partying socializing far important. Reinfection already demonstrated occur, still trying figure prevalence. worry immunity. would assume none scientists say otherwise. Yes. nothing equally damaging lockdown.

They running ideas stop people stupid. Lmfao can't real comment. I'll physical therapist deliver massage doordash. Easy peasy. Well comment section article France, enacting stay-at-home order except school work.

So schools close, kids can’t get in-person peer-to-peer interaction anywhere. talking Republicans wanting end social programs desperately need it, stimulus passed even wrong. piece shit Republican senators returned got crooked judge supreme court gave giant FUCK every single American. They've got fuck everybody else. Non essential business closed. I’m athletic. walk hike that’s normal HR me, I’m usually 60’s. exactly. stocks pushing market affected pandemic. Right Google apple Microsoft Facebook make nearly 20% entire market. really feel like March comments like this. Like 99.95% teens then. lockdown part list solutions simply that. dont apply items list wont work well. UK perfect example this. local police announced twitter 7 months ago bother calling 911 unless life danger understaffed. man took child hostage knife recently took cops 3 hours get there. time there's peaceful protest, never seems shortage cops gas punch people OT pay...

Edit: point can't bother show hostage situation, 0% chance they'll enforce masks. You’re nurse you’re using “95th percentile” mean you’re healthy?

Are sure you’re nurse that’s 95 percentile means Well, yes citizens follow mandates afterwards

Every day continues compliance drops work france bosses’ opinion toward remote working drastically shifted since February Lol bad bot.   Yet, empirical evidence suggests restrictions, hospitals get overwhelmed. think happened New York Italy?

What think finally bring cases back level virus could managed? That's layoffs happened, way.

Sorry, regardless think, small % people get hospitalized much bigger number seems, despite (relatively) low fatality rate, multiple times worse flu already heavy burden hospitals normality.

I see restrictions lockdowns, argument masks hold much water. excess deaths? I've seen things nearly big disparity official deaths relative likes Mexico, Peru Ecuador (where 2.4 times higher cases, Mexico lowest disparity three) can't seem find national numbers. agree. that's think really important people willing able volunteer trials available. vaccine really one major thing people looking order 'solve' this. I've signed [1Day case anyone else interested type participation. 7 day average today 9x opened schools. yeah you’re pretty obviously wrong. Anti semitism yes. concept racial purity common everywhere, Eugenics bit that, setting specific demographic population breed called bad races also bad traits. OP neither number truly accurate, no? around 1-2 deaths per day then? scenario life Europe Summer 2021 closer normal now? brain says pretty much rock bottom things improve point.... taking bait, thanks playing. LMAO don’t know that, it’s guess. said certain hundreds thousands die soon virus isn’t controlled whatever means necessary, including lockdowns.  I'll take boring long factual. amazing watching 30 minutes CNN followed 30 minutes Fox; two different universes. past weeks many administrative courts like suspended late-night curfew administrative court found many arguments curfew decision. judges found necessary significant reduction incidence infection. referred Robert Koch Institute. According judges, number cases increased celebrations family friends, institutions old people's nursing homes, hospitals connection religious events travel. 

Another point accommodation ban many states introduced Germany got overturns one one [higher state favor full lockdown end partial lockdown make much sense. government wants much stricter rules households shutdown hotels/bars still keep schools open factorys data behind problematic. look yesterday report Private households bit factor **Only quarter total number reported COVID-19 cases attributed specific outbreak. ** beginning pandemic Germany, weeks 13-18, many COVID-19 cases assigned nursing homes well hospitals refugee homes, weeks 23-32, workplace often given probable infection environment. Since summer (from week 33 on), number outbreaks private households represented largest share outbreak situations besides workplace leisure activities. Recently, number cases old people's homes nursing homes also increased again.--

Again RKI clear guidelines schools different minsters educations states [refuse follow (this link German)

So problem big problem new restrictions per se wish-washy Government gives shit science evidence like it. also matters maliciously preventing getting aid holding work november 9th. whos laughing camera someone demands pass bill help Americans. don’t, really think excess deaths spiking like crazy unrelated covid well? affects deathrates, infection rates last time checked, it? I’d agree, virus dangerous lol  said wasn’t relevant nothing it. alcohol monopoly could absolutely used example argue around states right control purchasing alcohol, little powers terms reigning pandemic. 

I mean let’s take dance permits example - restaurant dance hall applies via police government body, municipality also involved granting permit. municipality responsible inspecting space, police example consider whether required bouncers/guards business.
Do see point decentralized powers? wanted “nanny state” powers would centralize much possible - give one governmental body right grant, inspect, revoke punish things would happen faster. 

This one silly example, see tons legal areas Sweden. Often times it’s split executive government bodies, local/municipal bodies specialist representatives. makes harder power take strong-handed, quick decisions. Yea, dynamics trust interesting. goes beyond situation -- humans trust familiar with, regardless circumstance, even though familiarity absolutely nothing actual trustwortiness.

I've immune it, always perplexed me... Familiarity is, far, #1 way people end victims various things. Forreal. Dude needs put foot down. families health. Imagine guilt he'll feel something happened stones stand ground. It’s good news people actually it. That'd require reading article though long things stay way? It’d ridiculous lock reopen middle winter... Whatever day fully approved vaccine gets announced huge surge stock market. think happen November/December, higher, lower. stock market investor confidence, reality. Sounds like great time stock shares.  Oh fuck off. exactly guy supposed fix nationwide shitshow Covid? said, even case, still parents help kids setting things up. still family several computers several kids follow lessons. Sometimes even need several different rooms.

2/3/4/5 kids different ages go school they'll room, teacher, table. household, even access Internet, easy.

Lockdown absolutely amplifies inequalities toward education access. documented, discussed proven first lockdown. think good healthwise schools open. think good lots students access school lockdown.

I'm advocating open schools, explaining part someone working education field France. Um, I’d disagree sick last 16 days it. today stopped feeling like complete garbage. It’s terrible flu strain year. really don’t want it. probably higher. secondary deaths also going higher, undocumented.

People can't get hospital due overloading COVID patients, people refuse go fear getting COVID. People get depressed all, losing job business. People starve collapsing economy effects. Etc etc.

These people die COVID, may die, due COVID.

Not mention still sure long term health effects. almost like pandemic going on. That’s self defense situation given. It’s self defense throw first punch. Obviously one knows efficacy yet, even researchers unblinded study yet.

I hope like effective, mean based even hitting number people required unblind study, may good news vaccine super effective. betting life assertions armchair epidemiologist hope nobody else does. definitely do. financial uncertainty, holding now. originally to-do list summer. Right, I'm saying *are* people know they're 21 29 31. 15. 3. highly doubt Pfizer CEO, Bourla, knows, people there's got rumors flying around. right rumors going Bourla wrong ones going Fauci? vice versa? We'll find out, suppose. Right. 🙄 must say I’m grateful living Australia. Melbourne went lot get cases didn’t would cut rest country cases negligible zero. Living Queensland haven’t community transmission case month last couple cases I’m fairly confident next cases dealt well. Life similar 2019 it’s nice able go without Covid around. people wear masks risk low community transmission comes back change. 

It’s true many countries wouldn’t able done. difference Australia closed borders early kept closed acted early getting cases nationwide. countries go tens thousands daily cases single digits would difficult would take mass compliance. 

I worry US Europe right given winter coming there. Please stay safe. I’m trying push COVID benign virus, believe serious bad consequences things need done it, (1). Lockdown great negatives -for lot people- worse virus itself, (2). Lockdowns aren’t way dealing COVID, haven’t really proven effective dealing it, plus terrible side effects lockdown god knows long take us recover from, don’t try something else? one remembers bringing 1.8 trillion dollars? Nancy declining it? get people unemployed money? know like think either Republicans democrats table nothing. Shameful best, parties. There’s weird psychological thing going on. I’ve heard many friends say, “but I’m seeing family” “close friends.” familiarity comfort granted therein, anything likelihood spread. It’s fascinating see, sarcasm. really bad assessing risk, trust familiar us. There’s whole case study that. Two groups remote workers emerge post-pandemic, predicts Michel Serafinelli, economics lecturer University Essex: commute office twice week, one week month intensive brainstorming conference-style meet-ups.

The later sounds pretty amazing... Especially employer pays travel. One week work-cation, 3 weeks slack off.. lol. definitely positive aspects physical distancing, especially retail workers get shit. said, many people hard hearing. need right face hear aids, course, 6 feet plus masks, muffle people bit, made nightmare trying hear people public. Didn’t Trump say mission accomplished virus? Yep think underestimate good leadership capable doing. members parties talking washing hands, social distancing, masks etc relentlessly would make huge difference. whole thing marketed like war effort encouraging everyone help. GOP turning story citizens rights vs patriotic duty sad killed lot people. I’ll never forgive sacrificing lives political points. Could downturn Tech Senate hearings today? Perhaps Trump wants publicly censor services that’ll inevitably stall growth Sounds like need new windows 45,000 Americans hospital president saying they've beaten it. Yikes. Actually, that’s necessarily true. times life wanted something, understood wasn’t necessarily rational. wanted. 

That may, fact, difference rational irrational people. understand irrational. don’t. think time time, think friends lost parents grandparents, people whose grandkids never get know them. late.

As Australian, baffling embarrassing watch majority planet bungle pandemic. ""We listen!"" What's everyone's countries Halloween?

Just cancelled, change 2 things hear I'm Melbourne, Australia, implemented 6 week lockdown like workplaces still open. continued spread closed workplaces. another 12 weeks harsher lockdown workplaces schools closed except groceries, pharmacies, essential things like that.The harsher lockdown worked bringing us back average less 3 daily cases now, wish they'd started first half arsed version enough. happened March based upon reports China experience....eg would locked house 14 days *minimum*.

Justin Turner got removed world series game positive test, proceeded party teammates won.

the presidents travels well documented.

i get people would stock (no warning someone know coming it) hell actually enforcing this? 

i dunno. im going stockpile anymore. 1% population dies traffic accidents? definition people bad citizens, ask country really needs them. Alors used time bought first lockdown implement stringent border, testing, contact tracing isolation procedures really saved ass season two. 
While Macron government seem sitting hands summer inciting everyone travel around enjoy vacation. organization produced founded former members Cato Institute. makes battle among kissing cousins. Start saying no. did. Michael\_Jackson\_popcorn.jpg spikes crested yet. believe fecal testing Baltimore second spike dwarf first. grandpa Anzac. he's proud handling Australia. Never leave fellow Aussie behind always said.

We value working together greater good. didnt think something rare cultures. Well, past summer much, much better current situation. Americans making curve go Making sure take care family case disruptions/emergencies hardly selfish. would argue that, fact, selfish ones ones means prepare refuse to, thereby guaranteeing TSHTF either going look government take care resort begging (or stealing) responsible. pointing Australia eradicated COVID-19 like NZ Vietnam. don’t know reach friends see real life point. wanna wish thing eventually “over” date keeps getting pushed pushed don’t see light end tunnel anymore. think see data! think take grain salt. don’t think they’re going blatantly lie, incentives meet least 50% mark. think everyone wants vaccine, know that. I’m saying conspiracy theory, I’m saying numbers might inflated. move may hurt economy destroy livelihoods, countless lives saved. major Texas summer outbreak cities interesting watch winter. First major cold front came Texas week, sending people indoors. Curious fast rise cases light fairly significant acquired immunity, well reports reinfections. goes Florida California, well. cut dry like suggest. arial sure, mathematically quite small risk. They're making decision losing everything slight possibility might get disease kills low percentage people. Haha, yep, require everyone vaccine. problem closing doesn’t mean losing money...it means losing everything. Almost business earth close chill 12-18 months (or however long). science say that? I've ever heard opposite.  Really sorry hear mate. UK's situation hurts personally dad's Londoner, im dual citizen half family lives there. usually visit yearly, pandemic, I'd planning pursuing post-grad UK, obviously thats hold now.

I truly hope guys get top it, best crazy time. Stay safe! matter people respond, indoor dining, live events, meeting friends inside never safe. responsible people are, less people get sick less people die. saying shorten timeline back normal social lives isn’t true. GOD EMPEROR TRUMP DEFEATED CHINA VIRUS work, people deny even real. masks.

 ""I dont know one who's died""

Meanwhile live county unpopulated. That's like saying people die **OF cancer**, die secondary problems **HAD cancer,** refusing acknowledge cancer cause secondary failures. 

***Doesn't sound fucking stupid?***  Without vaccine open next winter. highly recommend get reddit find ways build mental resilience. Reach friends connect whatever way can. Cook good meal. awful isn’t forever come stronger ever ready take whatever challenges choose. Yep.

Anti mask mandate. Fighting requiring businesses provide worker protection.

Writing wall big fucking red letters. exact behavior seen Spanish flu. It’s time social media starts getting regulated. It’s fairly new industry grown exponentially last 2 decades. said, news isn’t regulated well be. one step time. Yeah, totally unlike millions deaths... error statement ""doesn't endanger family teachers"". can't see John Cena like people *surely* comply second round lockdowns? Right. focus recovery rate many hospitalizations -- weeks months forgetting about? That's walk park mortgage serious commitments. takes care professor's kids spouse hospitalized month? might young every 10 years go age increase lethality factor 10 so. Yeah get districts lucky US national mandate. I'd expect Biden imposed national mandate, federal $ assistance would included make sure kids internet capabilities. r/COVID19_support Link work context I'm guessing that's statement UK vaccine task force head? ut would point likely best person job wife MP ruling party. also claimed would need vaccinate vulnerable people end pandemic

In case, pure speculation vaccines 50% effective point. ""from we're seeing"" support assertion. closest point phase 2 results prove efficacy resulted close 100% people showing strong immune response.

And ""targeting"" creating less severe cases sterilising immunity. vaccine developers trying create effective vaccines yet know whether case yet vaccines.

Honestly, relentless pessimism people put nearly bad likes Trump pretending whole thing over. Uh sir, reddit. Morons abound here. comments good laughs best. tried growing pair realising labelled inconsiderate asshole way better letting daughter die? right. cousin morbidly obese. died last night sleep diagnosed covid day before. Infrastructure far perfect enough situation way mentioned it. certain sympathy older teachers familiar PCs printed manuals install use software. Sure, may easy first technical problems rocket science. People professions also get done homeoffice see teachers excluded this.

The Kultusministerium smart planning kinds programs use etc. summer time late. Would've helpful general lockdown also schools/classes temporarily quarantine. Yeah that's pretty much. closed general travel completely still knowledge, Australians return home, whereupon shuttled plane PPE onto bus landingstrip, sent hotel quarantine two weeks/get tested several times.

To knowledge method also extends important business travel, special circumstances like sick family member, etc.

We can't leave country either, unless apply special circumstances: career, sick family member related etc. much issue, imagine people start getting sick soon. Though talk opening travel bubble New Zealand also essentially eradicated virus, kind travel least. sister countries, like maybe UK/Scotland example, usually freely travel/live/work/study other. nice sibling back! know take piss lot Kiwis, miss you! tell part think incorrect?

Edit: think something im saying incorrect, tell instead deleting it? would helpful everyone reading it. Yeah, ways go mental health &amp; resilience. lot store us thanks climate change everyone better start practicing mindfulness improving community connections ASAP. Agreed, sides equally stupid. I’m getting sick winning. It’s funny word travelers complaining people taking seriously. Like, dude traveled across country hike here. Hiking like almost bottom list transmitting Covid... you’re travel across country coming contact countless people it. Everyone prepped times.

No American household less one months food pantry. Yes does. explained it. saying ""that count"". That's argument. shows state trust Swedes. Gambling also state monopoly. dangerous unless government gets cut. social democrats get cut. passed law saying run lotteries. A-lotterierna.

No not. possible. mention dance permits. Swedish ""constitution"" extremely weak. nothing like US constitution. See grundlagsreformen 2010. ""Last Christmas, gave COVID, next day, took away...."" single greatest line show, feels like magnitudes whole character building line. going interesting arrive place time finally good look coped crisis there's changes needs done future. 

My guess ability government put country lockdown would one considerations. hopefully changes made would lot less reactionary popular ideas subreddit seems demand. Yeah. \^ . ""Hey whipped vaccine months"" seems like quick way get health issues. Hell even FDA approved drugs cause issues side affects. even including money politics tied this. time cycle alone enough give pause.  think we'll close around spring/late spring keep hope you’re aware, hell put damned smiley face end comment?! Don’t obnoxious, man, he’s trying help No, saying exponential growth rate suprise would said months ago, changed months. anything got slower. Looking daily case rates 26th month, 7-day avg:

July 26th: 900

August 26th: 4000 (4.5x)

Sept 26th: 12000 (~3x)

Oct 26th: 38000 (~3x)

People suprised last month absolute numbers, see e.g. [How France's Covid-19 second wave exploded one growth long time, less rapid first wave. Maybe I'm smart enough read this, key takeaway ""72% reduction medical visits patients one risk factors (50+,BMI +30, etc)"" target group emergency use authorization point? That's replied person made statement. Untrustworthy statistics Please, go tell parents lost child sick hearing it.

You removed *this* incivility? Really...? course have. Reddit, people lie it. millions people got direct federal state payments. cant close lol, dont send kids teen school year straight suck everything fucked entirely, already closed march september cant, also kids home mean parents working school need opened otherwise cant work, thats all

&amp;#x200B;

no perfect solution im pretty ok witht considering solution, also play video game home ""oh no, anyway"" use civil language. user 'abusing' people, they're presenting statistics accurate. disagree, think showing compassion keep language civil that. Feeling pretty hopeless. I’m stay home mom pandemic amplified it. feel like people think we’re nuts still taking seriously. honestly, I’m feeling fatigue hardcore. don’t know much longer this. I’m desperate normalcy return.  Ok understand this. Stop trying make everyone join depression party. Well seems...bad... Like ACTUALLY FUCKING LOST WAR FUCK. Different age ranges.

Who one can’t analyze data? really depends bad infection rate deaths are, counties things closed others. least California. viruses working together you’re correct it’s much detailed discussion go coronavirus reddit stream. I’m simply trying point revisionist history US getting annihilated. didn’t lose war soil, lost public backing, ton $, soft power. also cost US ton point citizens mostly believed whatever US Government told them. PBS Ken Burns documentary good look all. I’m sure respond trolls it’s aggravating let others read disinformation. I’m United States. it’s always money mental health well being. USA. USA. USA. !mkhm,,,, issue convincing people virus isn’t hoax. It’s also possible get reinfected measles twice, chance less 1%. making fiscally conservative socially liberal independent cry :( Scotland, Ireland Wales proactive England area.

In saying that, long borders open (which basically Europe works, isolated island like Australia NZ) never achieve Australia achieved (not quite elimination whole country averaging less 5 locally transmitted cases per day, pretty close).

The best case scenario suppress numbers. suppose suppression strategy could work done properly UK Europe made mistake opening far quickly July. need make sure another huge spike can't keep shutting economy restarting shutting forth.  wonder many small businesses (knowing know now) would shut February permanently. I’d surprised number less 90% understand people's jokes IRL time I'm spectrum I'm depressed hoping new partial lockdown's results start taking effect week? according they'd either reschedule national speech (Pers-conferentie idk english word sure...) later week next week's tuesday, announce either rules, inform everyone stuff's going better? think change hospitals reach capacity, hospitals need choose gets ventilators doesn't, people start dying hospital hallways. fully convinced going start happening several parts country soon, possibly starting Wisconsin. 

I truly think winter going much worse initial peaks Spring Summer. think agreement actually. NZ control, also pretty good prerequisites. still real achievement government it’s people. don’t think would possible say Belgium though, due different conditions. 

Lockdowns temporary emergency situation. hard, don’t leave house type. Everything else restrictions, bans recommendations. precautions want. surely used slow spread, hospitals cope whilst waiting vaccine. Kids make best decisions  properly valued causes great stress even pro-restriction people shows government broken since ability alleviate decent amount chose fight battles. 

Why leave part out? Someone cares dividends? lot companies even pay one. people saying businesses need bailed ones saying individuals insurance savings get unforeseen emergencies

Firstly, that’s true. two notions diametrically opposed, ample savings would need bailed out? Secondly, little issue outlook savings, long businesses aren’t forced close doors. That’s emergency. It’s manufactured destruction.

Damn, continue dishing insults can’t take little return? pride, though. 🤣

You’ve still clue you’re talking about, thinking one micro-economic concept panacea global problem. 🤦‍♀️ Sure. grand scheme things, means nothing say ""social distancing prevent 3rd wave."" People told million times ""socially distance"" worked Europe nebulous concept turned catchphrase. Yes. Sad getting downvoted; masses see yet. media knows divisiveness drives clicks traffic site. honestly even think intended divide nation; side effect sells. think lot Americans experience though makes much difficult. 

Years think pandemic studied particularly (even young/healthy) got bad cases others essentially mild symptoms worse cold. February? bet that’s want. stay home forever. Never leave huh? kids find funniest Fauci Trump seem wrong. Trump wrong, Fauci still seems overly optimistic. Unstable. Right.

How many coronavirus vaccines inoculated with? Next week: ""Covid-19 Vaccine Available February, Fauci Says"" thought Pfizer going submit FDA mid-November. something changed? cases dead country face earth know. We're quite good protesting rioting, national sport. yellow vest movement something two years ago. strangely seem much reason rioting, think people would say overall decision correct one.

Or perhaps I'm wrong. We'll see. france declared ""out work"", say still working cant go compagny got something like 98% salary pretty good people calling Czech Republic Czechia? Maybe high assets might change stock weight home ownership business assets small business owners. Oh no, sorry hear that. mom also lives long term care makes nervous. Thanks, well. big brain strats. gg. realize article Canada, right? Well reference human coronavirus vaccines ....

I'm waiting. Stay fuck home, every disease ever eradicated. Yes, said virus. Scary. Jesus joke. trying show see happy world try things get better.

And say also haha got big raise that's I'm happy. 

Jokes hard understand internet though depressed fuck. Fuck Abbott. got us mess. refused mandate masks, blamed Jenkins locking people jail wearing masks (never happened), mandate masks, polling locations (because apparently number people can't get mask would outweigh people would risk stay home instead vote?), would nice could mail ballots, fought hard limited ballots single location.

Abbott done nothing help virus spreading done everything personally benefit position instead. wasnt enforced technically lockdown. describing human behavior.  city today man, saw stores deserted damn angry upset. 

The business owners staring door, waiting someone come. 

The employees stores standing waiting sell product quite literally, nobody. standard data sub comes claims magnitude.

Let's say, face value, athletes COVID. make super-spreader event. tests things, super-spreading statistical term begin end ""a group people"".

Also one sent ModMail responded exactly brought I'm confused idea I'm abusing mod privileges. replying message sent. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* saying government botch this, Regeneron working April, even starting manufacture antibodies large scale clinical trials even. really moved faster this. unfortunate antibody therapies easily scaled mass production. first country Europe start posting bad numbers Spain, hotspots popping way back July, Madrid looking quite bad right schools opened. Since schools opened, things really gotten worse Madrid, they've stabilizing.

It's possible schools lot second wave, also possible timing coincidence. LOL. bit ironic, given border wall BS administration ... lol Many Americans move tired hearing covid Member 100,000 death predictions supposed shocking Trump first mentioned Covid hit? member. Huh? Sweden nanny state. can't buy alcohol 3 pm Saturday. State runs eastern bloc relic type monopoly. ruling party proposing mandatory preschool two year olds. Homeschooling banned. go on.

Swedish state trust Swedes one bit. That's explanation. How? everyone either A) already laid B) ""essential"" worker idea, I’m saying apparently possible happen. Good luck getting 50% Americans take vaccine Pretty much. Username relevant, lol. 

That’s crazy, since 121 already died months February July.

But that’s exactly said, though I’m surprised misconstrued comment, given ability analyze data. children experienced encephalitis? teens organ transplants? kids wound ventilators fighting life, despite surviving virus? Hundreds thousands children tested positive, position must simply hold breath hope don’t come mysterious Kawasaki-like Syndrome appearing amongst demographic. Don’t twist words minimize impact virus upon minors.

And again- point remains, stated article. believed children didn’t die virus. 121 died February 12 July 31. many, many hospitalized severe complications Covid. point. 73,200 new cases Tuesday

This sounds low big country. According 411,082 tests per 1 million population. Germany 242,996 tests per 1 million.

Germany lost control expecting hit 30,000 next week perhaps 60,000 two three weeks.

New restrictions (=soft lockdown) starting next Monday. ended dealing it, worrying it.      

As ever did. long think 18 year olds handle going school without permanently damaging them?

""permanently damage"" seems little overdramatic. Learning home ideal bad either. Especially nowadays possibilities given internet. South Korea Vietnam comparing Islands pointless. It’s though..? Yap people think it’s lol True. 

All future discussion speculation. Same. mainly shit outside different...maybe main difference can't get food alcohol 11 kind annoying oh well. think that's lockdowns fail arrest virus totally.

It's cannot feasibly demand people work two weeks, go shops whatever government decides causes cases (in Wales, buying books: Scotland, drinking alcohol indoors).

After three months restrictions even diligent sick them. economy shitter (disproportionately affecting poor, much regular recession) non-Covid deaths treatable causes rising. hard ask people.

Lockdown fatigue palpable UK. really stringent first follow rules half-heartedly best. people know London outright breaking rules way, however regretfully feel it.

It seems lockdowns work fixed period. Anything compliance evaporates. better one! So, none places us. Oh god, another loony

What happened sub Even case (which isn’t), there’s still legitimate reason wear mask. negative wearing one, adds positive aspects. Easy: curbside service only. customers building. seating areas, inside out. top ten population density, although quite dense.

Belgium 22nd world, exclude countries population million, 15th. Funny news supposed fact check reality report findings. fed certain version reality forced check ourselves. would better without vast majority ""news"" sold population. So.. 3-5 days America :( Fuck politics! shitlords don’t care us right, even though almighty hive mind wanna admit yet.

There's massive sunk cost fallacy going on... lockdowns went BEYOND original ""two weeks flatten curve"" fucked absolutely **everything**, must've worth it, ...right?!

Sure would funny totally fucking ruined global economy, human rights, mental health people's trust politicians/mainstream media/health organisations/science end, virus gonna virus anyway. palm growing face! Haha that's amazing. Trump immune problem solved point view. care anyone else. Sweden deaths first wave completely breaks theory. We've situation literally *because* asshats wanting haircuts, beach parties, bar openings, etc. could locked fuck right away could dealt dragged made infinitely worse everyone. pretended give fuck actual economy railing inconvenience like selfish children. live Japan. big city go trash about. reddit Japan perfect utopia nobody farts litters seem link, around 50% people Vit sufficient, even less north go 80% admitted Vit deficiency. feels like entire year point. Oh god lol colorful description

Seriously orwellian ""fake news"" shouting. election week come faster shit change already like guys think anyone middle east here. perhaps American self-centered arrogance believe well liked everyone. need second stimulus check. Unfortunately never going happen :( Schools closed since mid october 2nd november ""Toussaints"". kind holiday. yeah schools open reality closed 2 weeks. I'm reading that. Reinfection looks like rare phenomenon moment. That's really that. disinformation. read it. could post link, open reading it. I’m already terrified happening right now. point wish bunker hide in. Helps it’s state lock though. sure talking Germany here? government covered payrolls first lockdown. People already parties. Facebook feed full Halloween Party pics past weekend. live UK visited Sweden (where family is) twice since started. Coming back Sweden like coming back life. 

Here UK people _existing_, really living. quite appreciate depressing go somewhere else. mental health effects UK going catastrophic many years come. lol fuck Thank frightening correction USA needs first something. Nothing says world no1 like never ending wave 1sts! Fission mailed! How? acknowledged caveat ECDC point still net positive. Yes I’m sure. I’m also sure could find couple isolated cases people thinking like vast majority wanna see family think benefit family time outweighs risk death. Statistically people see 99.99 chance survival okay see elderly family members even personally don’t wanna take chance. feels like winning hard didn’t even know it?

Arrête avec ces bêtises. Il se trouve que j'habite en France, mais ça n'a pas d'importance. Comme le montrent tes commentaires, tu sembles posséder une haine particulière envers les autres américains et les considères tous comme des crétins sans éducation. Mais ce n'est pas parce que t'es de cet avis que c'est vrai, et d'ailleurs je te conseille d'apprendre ce que le mot ""analphabète"" signifie réellement. De plus, est sur Reddit, donc je vais te tutoyer comme je veux, comme le font déjà les français ici, et comme tu l'as fait toi-même avec moi.

Putain, tu veux *vraiment* mourir sur cette colline ? Un point-virgule et le terme ""covid"" que même les publications françaises utilisent parfois ? Comment tu survis chaque jour en voyant de telles atrocités linguistiques autour de toi ? Tu dû avoir une crise cardiaque lorsqu'ils débattaient entre ""le"" ou ""la"" covid. J'espère que tu vas mieux maintenant. live Asia norm feeling sick actually sick , wear mask. It’s normal live wear mask you’re sick. 

But you’re healthy , course don’t wear mask. People perception asian countries always wear masks fair, one long ass month since March. Australian here.

The rich famous allowed “self quarantine” mansions oversight arriving...everyone else gets shafted hotels pay for.  That's completely incorrect lol.

He needs resign.

That sentence contains subject ""he"" verb ""resign"".

Same wth second sentence.


You know talking getting high horse.

What total dogshit comment you. better. bars restaurants (indoors?) close, literally worst lockdown history lockdowns. Also worse GDR Third Reich combined people finally overthrow government this! Vae Victis! Fingers crossed, get vaccine December vulnerable Bahrain current decline carries least end year good note ... hopefully. rest us support Vic economy.

The federal government much. Covid-19 crisis even less affordable I'm actually debating that. trying say people fields behavioral sciences also needs chime subject. Pandemic fatigue, human judgment rationality time imminent threat, emotions political division, importance body language human interaction... important factors well. Today conference chancellor prime ministers states proceed. check news. girlfriend live Chicago planning visiting group 8 friends northern Minnesota skiing New Years. Recently spikes across Midwest especially MN, decided pull out, I'm torn it. one hand, Chicago MN travel quarantine, feel generally inadvisable unnecessary trips right things get worse. hand, going see group 8 20-something year olds, it'll us unless outside hills, possible drive there.

What think right call here? mean sound awful honestly. Assuming trust everyone quarantine get tested last week, guys outside separated, sounds like nice gathering. people attached family gatherings such, fault them. I'm one them, understand missing people seems like they're trying something safe Popeye punching octopus. don’t understand logic, Christmas time starts everyone go groups numbers rise anyway irrelevant though White House said pandemic right? ^/s im tracer US. Today spoke ER nurse one nurses receiving covid patients. bucket brains thought would good idea attend massive indoor funeral. bunch dead people outbreak didnt need happen.

Sometimes wonder even try

I also spoke parents 11 y/o special needs child passed away. got covid school reason. even special needs kids attending person classes? way able maintain mask distancing protocols kinds children. sad. it’s not, people strong make though much you’re giving credit for. There’s people think damn death better managing confusing ""official advice wear masks"" ""no official advice wear masks"". Plenty people wear masks even mandates settings (e.g. flying). fair based heard tests done vaccine, quite safe. Right? sure that? money make people act strange. added stress debt creates. longer wait longer take get shit control. destroy country longer lockdown weeks time certainly will. Yes they’re still collecting unemployment minimum $400-$600 week, great higher minimum wage people work making ""one day"" increase bunch states adding supposed ""backlog"" ""probable"" cases COVID stretching back June. literally make numbers want point, framing ""one-day"" increase misleading way cause panic.

Also, 6% actual reported COVID deaths COVID. rest people died already sick threatened something lying opinion? Trump? governors? CDC?

The CDC already said 6% COVID-related deaths COVID, rest people died COVID. That's big difference. vast majority people get making numbers?

There lots false positives dubious numbers line. Trump's cabinet even admitted count COVID deaths anyone COVID died practically reason. Easy way pump numbers make scarier is. Imagine Halloween Election Day.  government help businesses out. Places proven outbreaks? It’s seems outbreaks across country. don’t understand mean. one saying hey come visit mom dad kill corona get life insurance!! Alaska same. Makes sense snd I’d rather fly people took test. that. people contact tracing. means calling people they've positive test, turn means calling people determined may infected. supposed work way.

The result state tracing infection, behind means data gathering.

Im contact tracer texas. weve operated since day one. pathetic. see there. nice.  also, there’s big wide world outside US. think like what’s happening backyard come conspiracy theories. doesn’t change fact rest world suffering - places healthcare isn’t inly rich. [Yep, definitely realised Kim Jong-un lot companies already broke due first lockdown, close 4 weeks again? Also places it’s even proven outbreaks close again. title also bit misleading, everything close, bars restaurants. lmao im tracer texas thats accomplished since started spring. We've never ahead point theyve given trying. entirely due project management failures. Straight veins. mexico 160k excess deaths since covid hit, hit twice bad(in deaths) US report 4times less cases, US report 1/4 actual cases, mexico would 1/32 meaning 20% mexicans could get it

they testing around 24x less mexico US virus can't teleport. around people, going get infected. 

Proof would efficient hard lockdown compared current mask mandates. R 0.5 much Europe lockdown, Wuhan 0.3. despite mask mandates Europe hovering around 1.5.

Masks might help bit sure (just like e.g. hand washing), quite conclusively proven silver bullet like physical distancing be.  spreading disinformation? What’s agenda? wife works small shop first thing owner install electronic lock could control could enter store remotely inside. never deal crazies beyond telling phone go away they’re calling police. Sure, school closed work home possible numbers game care going bar children’s education? republican presidents boners declaring 'mission accomplished!' prematurely? enough capacity Czech Republic (the First Lady sewing masks)!and largest surge per 100,000 Europe. Thoughts virus doesn’t want stopped? Australia NZ done great things they’re basically island control access. Ironic. Well done China. Basically took seriously, acted fast decisively top situation ever since. broad support Chinese people.

Now many months on, China thriving (and growing). resilient system place seem capable mitigating future outbreaks.

Meanwhile developed free countries still busy arguing herd immunity strategies whether masks work.

The world turned upside down. good guys actually bad guys bad guys good. Places love human rights busy killing elderly places human rights trying pretty hard protect populations. Fuck sake. Think I’ve got it. Since last night I’ve gone cold sweats hot FLASHES, sore throat cough. Goddamn people gym refuse wear mask. first responder fucking suck worst parts are... suppose get knee surgery return work gf left without even trying help terminate lease leaving 6k bill. 

Fuck Christina. Fuck entitled ass Americans. Fuck COVID. social distancing impossible city? feel like matter time spreads every single person city. cases highest they've ever UK. People keep saying conservative government's fault know city folk absolutley SHIT respecting personal space. way virus spreads contact, government does. National elections held last week.. get put initials top get high score? Ok, yeah, sure might hard understand. way summarize data regions submit deaths occurs within 30 days positiv covid-19 death. combined control deaths registry miss anyone dies within 30 days positive test. case one region noticed messed criterias entering deaths data. corrected it. Given US mortality rate currently sits 4% (wordometer statistic), assuming somehow cut half even, indicate 10,000 people likely die infections last week alone? Yes. either raclette talking about. Restrictions needed populace follow health advice voluntarily. locale voluntarily wears masks. restrictions required.

But places people follow health advice voluntarily. restrictions placed get responsible thing. restrictions mean people following precautions. Well yeah, may dawned you, he's American. Lol diabolical wickedly smart literally influenced America destroy inside. exploited weaknesses. knows art war. people know assholes hole ground. bit late, case numbers exploding ICUs filling alarming rate.

Also good luck reopening bars one month. think going happen. coworker, isn’t trump fan, stays saying shit. 

NO, it’s gonna disappear!! It’s pandemic!! It’s doesn’t exist political stunt. It’s *REAL* it’s killing people. 

But can’t go it, she’s manager 😂  Merkel ruining country that, everything supermarkets close, however schools kindergartens remain open. fuck? Yeah optimistically see CFR 1%, 1k positive tests per day expect least 10 dead.

I think combination demographics (e.g. universities open now) lag. Thats gotta be. ** took shortened season bright enough include address! ask thing lmao Miljöförvaltningen controlled lot weekend said thtat unusual calm payday weekend, another user wrote, people busses Uppsala - city busses never great - emptier busses around Uppsala. think see another week weekend get result. According SVT recommendations likely prolonged,because havent ""suppressed"" spread yet. 
Unfortunately appears like infection spread care homes again, 6 deaths last month.  /r/lostredditors won’t. could possibly come conclusion? imagine risking death think much butter food. Yeah numbers ""backlogs"" ""probable"" cases stretching back months. make sounds like 80k+ people contracted one day. clue many cases true false positives. point incredibly easy make numbers and/or frame ways make seem really scary. bunch dubious nonsense. LA going hit 5000+ day couple weeks German here, clear Laenderchefs agree that, discuss today Chancellor Merkel. Yes, Mexico among worst-hit places world. almost 200k excess deaths year. It’s horrifying catastrophe. assume kind antiseptic mouthwash. exactly “a safe amount time”? huge desert middle makes Australia urbanised - almost population concentrated urbanised areas around edges. you’re vaccines you’re antivax; that’s slur. People throughout giving perfectly logical reasons getting flu vaccine year. It’s really much read through. 

It must make feel special smarter medical experts. ""he genocidal among worst people, patriot""


I'm sorry, what's benefit patriotism still genocidal?  sucks recent increases makes 217 cases seem ""better.""

I miss July. country employs

I'm pretty sure countries inherited methodology USSR whatever.

Once again, COVID-specific, way cause death attributed death certificates Russia - always exactly caused body stop functioning. instance, person pneumonia (the regular one, cause by, say, pneumococcus) died weak heart able take 40C fever, cause death ""heart failure"" pneumonia listed significant concomitant deaths

I've already said Rosstat publishes data COVID-related deaths (the data gathered preliminary death certificates), numbers April - August even first category (laboratory-confirmed COVID main cause death) alone 21k (September data published early November, October - early December on), current official death count 27k noticeably lower end August.

I'm claiming deaths concealed, I'm arguing notion kind centralized conspiracy. I? dont want responses dont post public forum. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Yeah, I'm Australia read news report Los Angeles celebrating... wonder many celebrate positive covid test coming weeks. America gone mad (madder?). guys need worry China taking over, there'll nothing left America way things going! listed accomplishment current man charge leave come January something look back ""hard"" work year. Jeremy Bearamy Where? dragging New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Australia etc. course ongoing restrictions extent, obviously going case moment got China. something really thought implemented it. second nature cringe people take shoes home other's There's travel restrictions different health zones (I even think thing legal) could definitely affect areas. Today better though, 217 hell? hell you?.... Look, make simple. think CDC wrong

**SHOW paper confirmed 2019-nCoV virus met Koch's postulates: isolation, purification, visualization demonstration way virus infects body develops disease, I'll change mind.** Oh no! Anyways... Hear out, less testing = less cases. Boom pandemic Hungary. course started let people come back too, can't stay lockdown years.

And lockdowns casulties, dad died June go anywhere 3 months March, meet friends, stayed home, like government told to, developed thrombosis leg, died puminary embolism.

Please hurt me, said you. Obviously way common countries. I'd say 1 100, point Swedes wear masks, plenty *enough* Swedes (or least Stockholmers) weird.  many hospitals I’ve worked still hilariously underprepared covid patients. Since US cycle weeks behind Europe whole pandemic time US react warning signs flies past Europe numbers.

Realistically expect US pass Europes numbers end next month. Excuse ignorance, gargling? That's good habit imo. could never understand people wore shoes house, walk ground them, soles filthy! covid positive sub. uncommon, confirmed sequencing. since retain samples old infections sequencing next time get virus.

""When Last President Ignored Intelligence Briefing…""

**August 6, 2001 vacationing ranch, Crawford, Texas, Bush given Presidential Daily Briefing memorandum whose headline warns al-Qaeda terrorist leader, Osama bin Laden, “determined strike U.S.” briefed document C.I.A. analyst, Bush responds, “All right, you’ve covered ass now.”** Yeah it’s risk absolutely man need way blow steam. Chicago absolutely wild shit see added personal life shambles. need destress somehow. It’s risk sure couldn’t empty ass apartment day. think wearing mask making good thing remind people pandemic still there. see someone wearing mask always think belong riskgroup keep distance even more. shortages, case Germany. Calling festival German-speaking Europe ""Oktoberfest"" like saying, ""last weekend went Disneyland Ohio."" long glory holes were. country closed every single bar, hairdressers, almost every office worker sent home office, set foot office 3 months. 3k positive 10M people per day. lock again, useless. That's bad thing, too. things bad. think saddening even someone wants stay inside can't still need work put food table. programs help feed endure pandemic? make america great 523 dead Hope easy recovery Ha ha ha 

That’s funny. 2.8m dead big deal then? warped view life. feels like late. late? ""in power"". politician kind authority. even head FHM. scientific advisor. everyone’s safety, I’m hoping false positive. However, play game every player hasn’t received results yet? Can’t assume negative test every time. 
In regards game... realistically hope wasn’t close contact anyone new wasn’t already close last days didnt spread further. However, hard is, showed teammate felt deserved pass world series. one encourage someone break quarantine. makes feel like they’re ok get pass many couldn’t celebrate birthday/anniversary/promotion/birth child etc tested positive? 

According CDC guideline, every person within 6 ft 15+ min last 24 hours quarantine 14 days even negative result? Hopefully give pass time hit pandemic early hard. Europe US hit little late. want herd immunity, eradicate nation.  Without herd immunity, vulnerable still risk, ones likely allergic immunisation carrier materials genuinely unable vaccinate.  

Something like measles need 95% vaccination rate herd immunity.  know herd immunity requirement covid19 yet. many times explained? clearly issue science works. could also key well. wondering people tracking virus via shoes. know East Asian countries take shoes entering homes. husband now. used walk around house shoes. (I know gross. lot people knew growing this. live states.) sick since started years ago. Used get sick time. We've taking shoes immediately clothes come washed. Hands get washed get dressed comfortable clothing. Yes, needs emphasized frequently. many people equals vaccine perfect immunity. still need masks distancing. enough Personal beds, unfortunately. much there's way maintain masking distancing protocols, there's also way teach students outside setting.  Nah. Soft power overrated. I'm sure China's leaders making plans buy whole world fail states went bankrupt. tell still play music even they're packed bodies America F*ck yeah! Coming number one again! Whoo!
USA, USA, USA.

Don't worry guys, probably around country much longer 
We're ripping apart day day I've gargling every time come back outside, since pandemic started. Whether truly helps not, seems like smart thing do. Lol would letting anyone play tests came back? charge extra free? Seriously, tell flight conditions? ever want see interesting numbers. Go look coronavirus case statistics Texas. 
The day White House took statistics reporting CDC July 15th starting July 16th saw 50% reduction case numbers reported previous trends. suddenly September 21nd 22 thousand cases suddenly appear nowhere. 
Not I'm saying someone fucking numbers clear something wrong here. Nah, real numbers similar spring european countries get numbers small fraction (less 5% peak) without full lockdown. We'll next virus point. Probably emerge spontaneously viral soup White House. Funny months ago, peak pandemic, Mr. Fauci spoke completely wearing masks public... come guy quit fired yet?....

Here Mr. Fauci saying said: Actually Taiwan's population deeply fractured decades politics, health citizens considered political matter what-so-ever. political posturing submitted article. get again, good measure! seems besides point. long exhaust valves covered another mask, there's problem. close border international flight much much sooner too. Hindsight, guess. 'MERICA!!!

\*stuffs another cheese dog mouth\* democracy Shoot Dead misrepresenting point. take evidence intentionally lying drawing conclusion people masks wear them. argue may may reasonable conclusion conclusion lying sufficiently supported arguably greater degree. I’d say they’re good job. perfect certainly trying others I’ve read about.

My experience couple flights:

Things looked far cleaner pre-covid spraying left one flight, though turn around times, doubt comprehensive scrubbing every flight.

Empty middle seats felt good even someone right ahead / behind potentially.

No bandanas, masks valves them, doesn’t seem like exceptions beyond age.

Lots announcements keep masks obviously couldn’t see everyone time, people seemed (they made clear would reminding us not) though clearly time eating drinking allowed (briefly said).

Felt better indoor dining said though certainly without risk. 500 elderly deaths? mean garbage stuff, literally shit lmao We're clean, bodies soft say anything people wearing masks

and still wave 1. mask mandates needed like spanish flu people fucking stupid fuck easy solution fly anywhere. I'm good that. guarantee vaccine prevent long term lung, heart, brain damage. really hope does. disturbing number population said would refuse take vaccine simply vaccine. vaccine certainly help way nothing else could, it’s silver bullet. It’s like soon get vaccine rip mask go back way Times.  People actually interested truth defending innocent. Idk getting downvoted. true. starting Chicago too. Hospitals seeing rapid increases. continues going serious problems couple weeks. Big request shitty mayor. Better restaurants die people. rebuild restaurant, person. also suspect, widespread vaccinations people start going again, banks lenient lending start-up money former restaurant owners. Lol people still believe What's lives teachers compared statistics? /s No. It’s way many lawyers instead clients truth.

And usually get legal representation afford. can’t remember last time public defender got someone off. 

Affluenza teen lawyer example. thinks remotely fair? ugh. folding since March! know would trump 2020 flags flying mask burning protest? 🤦‍♂️

9-11 every couple days give shit! together. dip chunks bread mixture melted cheese white wine. obviously typically drink wine accompany it.

Its especially Parisian though. Christie one icu right? guy got stabbed going jail? Okay, cheers. It’s fact lied that’s issue. know reasoning make sure HC workers enough masks (allegedly). issue lie about. people supposed trust flat lied whole population? I’m assuming don’t like think Trump lying you, you?

Now, said, vaccine might effective 50% population gets it. Vaccines usually confer partial immunity work say, 90% population gets vaccinated. That’s measles outbreaks now- it’s dropped certain threshold. that’s shouldn’t fear monger based politics. You’re despicable really need areas across US. Take only! one ever says close way. 

Makes mad government can’t/refuses pay people (TEMPORARILY, course) stay home safe amount time let numbers die return person work SAFE. US can’t like every country closures aren’t going put people out! Kudos man! Except me. don’t wear mask Covid 5 weeks ago I’m going take advantage naturally acquired antibodies. feel like state-issued badge says “don’t look wonky, survived Covid.” I'll accept one. Maybe that's afford walk away. Correct. 

I suspect virus fatigue “fuck it” mentality anything else. going lock prevent spread point, going need exit plan. approval vaccine plan, lock lot economy still make progress toward immunity. 

Europe needs vaccine approved sell lockdown people.  dropped this:

/s Also DFW sunday told guy put mask target. followed came choked me. I'd say hostile. punched jaw big fat ass hit floor. Oh I’m GOP. Haven’t 18 years. originally registered Republican first eligible. didn’t last long. officially registered I. 

It’s hard. listen people talk, love ideas, it’s like “and people beaten streets”. Whelp. Never mind now. 

Sick it. sick it.  Yo! curfew 20k cases 66m ppl county? Poland 16k today, around 12k two weeks now, 38m ppl, came back reopened schools workplaces. trying lock again, shit hit fan bc stupid decision touch abortion laws clearly time that.

I'm even scared anymore, know change shit. care nobody is, shit show. lost control, country going autopilot. trump pompeo 6 months ago claiming enormous evidence came lab. evidence they'd used it. Clearly lie care, job supposed do. love use reach draw conclusion based evidence reaching draw conclusion. 

It’s reach all. 

Tell me, want find people X (fill literally anything want) ... question ask find actually it? Granted making reddit comment publishing irony hilarious.

That’s literally point. 

If random internet people spot massive flaw less 2 minutes, plausible professional researchers didn’t spot it? peer reviewers didn’t spot it? 

They’re either genuinely stupid, intentionally. It’s exactly unprecedented surveys designed purpose “supporting” particular conclusion. Well one's begging test subject Et tu PedrooBz? Fair point. couldnt find link mentions type mask, would mind pointing out? think important distinction I'm sure one scientific study would leave out. wonder number would lower lied masks dangerous month. second time hit ""population"" immunity! /s Oof. Insane unprepared this. everyone interests? things maybe year. Movies home lots cheaper. Reading book group. Walking / hikes. Cooking. Helping daughter school work. hanging friends. Church. don’t need large spectacles social.  I'm still curious fomites. public surfaces get touched time magically stuff lands mask face. invisible ink everywhere. “The vaccine hoax, want implant chip everyone monitor us”

- Sent iPhone 12 Bell 5G network Ok, Trump choice wear it.  you’re part trials? people take vaccine think? Cultural change hard everywhere. like idea punching spontaneously. funny image. clearly justified reason would absolutely open legal action used official reason.

For fuck's sake, seem view OP's statement somehow whole hiring scenario illegal action arbitrary discrimination. fucking wrong.  Let go. 

If said, ""hey saw posts FB wearing masks denying efficacy slowing spread pandemic I'm hiring appear poor judgement and, moreover, would health risk company mandated mask policy."" 

Tell us opens legal action? 
or, conversely, giving different reason subject legal action? 

You really idea talking about.  

Describe lawsuit would work: 

""Judge client hired defendant claimed lacked requisite skills but, reality, client denied fair consideration discriminatory practices part defendant."" 

- way client discriminated against? 

""Defendant denied client employment due client's anti-mask views posted Facebook page."" 

- So, client's religion, sexual orientation, race protected class definitions? 

""No honor. defendant told client hired due reasons, clearly hiring due stupid anti-masker ILLEGAL; otherwise would told reason. "" 

ok. plus chicks dig scars almost makes feel safe enough go Hawaii.... People like allowed live society, period people deserve rot jail, overall, species, we're improving.

You can't ways. slimy cunts can't thrown jail left rot, want everyone improve. need jailtime, counseling, community service, maybe more, that's best left experts decide would could ultimately bring back society functioning members.

Not mention many people either don’t insurance underinsured you’re pretty much get sick enough hospitalized. That’s scares personally Yes allowed ""figure reason hire absolutely allowed hire someone whatever reason want

Like different skin color, religion sexual preference? times process deciding want hire someone could called ""figuring reason"". even give reason.

That make legal officially gave reason. 

Indeed need give reason someone would masks find another reason exactly thinking job political alignment. could ""figure reason"" reason name Jeff suddenly decide hate name Jeff

Yes can't put official rejecting writing good reason. someone said ""If find someone black figure reason hire them"" argument might leg stand on. 

Big difference implicit explicit official reasons, especially writing. 

I texted thread buddy employment attorney reply 

""these people reason job"" hiring someone moron whether state completely legal good.

Then cite actual reason bunch mental gymnastics alternative reasons. Excellentay us democrats, democrat governor advising caution. us followed orders.

It probably means flee. Maybe kept body door. Maybe caught stabbing hitting realize police arrived. I'm throwing ideas think ""hold store"" likely euphemistic literal. I'm getting stabbed mask. many security guard. report nursing home deaths twice week, number artificially high honestly dense? understand unreasonable tell entire country need put lives hold indefinitely save lives literally undetectable compared normalized death rate?

Your threshold ""We everything can"" 1% deaths. fucking clue many people die cancer, car accidents, drug overdoses, transmittable illnesses COVID, smoking, heart disease given year? think everything possible save people too?

I'm saying people dying COVID sad. think 1% overall death rate justifies nationwide shutdown might dumbest thing I've heard life.

2) encouraged (once ""figured out"" ""you could know it"") FORCED... though form source control, rather PPE. sense agency self-protection ignored focus became ""THEY wearing mask, they're selfish!""

3) Ensure even distrust health agencies American people, time can't trust government either.

I’m sympathetic realistically new stimulus deal get passed before/in January election things settle in. still impression they're trying? proof? find bit intriguing that, although able make virus meet Koch's postulates yet, confirm ""attacks"" central nervous system. One postulates demonstration virus infects body, able prove laboratory yet. Fairly certain instance social distancing works better masks individual completely isolated everyone else.

If going shopping supermarket, mask going offer far better protection distancing.

Again, idea behind masks mandate personal protection. folks unknowingly asymptomatic exhaling virus place. There's time limit unemployment program designed help people temporarily jobs looking (think weeks even months), cover huge swaths country going work indefinitely mishandled plague killed economy.

The program working designed — designed conditions we're currently facing. government *could* come provide additional relief, instead ones currently control prefer give bunch money rich people, cram hasty judicial nominee, go vacation. COVID vaccine though? half subreddit said getting use excuses like ""I'm anti-vax, I'm anti vaccine."" Nope, anti-vax book. care excuse is.  Masks silver bullet. need wear right kind mask, need fitted properly, need wear eye protection NOBODY ideally gloves, another thing NOBODY does. keep preaching mask mandate like solve everything, even though 73% testing positive ALWAYS wear mask. forget Dubya left New Orleans die. Responding political pressure became unbearable. amazes although USA leader (in covid infection deaths) many people still ""it's happening there, worry here?"" Attitude.
Almost like broke Wuhan. 
Yes former hotspots like NYC california lower numbers, but, things opening up, removal face mask required signage (or wearing) IMHO, matter time faith humanity far little believe sadly. wish faith. care. doesn’t matter, I’m US citizen hospital employee. honestly believe USA may manage turn pandemic epidemic. Correct I'm wrong, Sweden basically soft lockdown anyways, secondary schools closed, half workforce going work home, banning large gatherings, emphasis social distancing? IIRC, health ministry said ""marathon, sprint."" restrictions harsh countries, they've remained mostly since March/April, compliance better. things related going far cant come back return. Multiple bankruptcy, growing rate unavailability hobs, overpopulation, Unemployment top three rich people owning half total money america examples.  saying someone lives Japan, even smaller apartment, so. Yeah. push ups. Walk around. great? No, to. 

You go way, I'll go mine. winning towards negative. Charities. bootstraps.  

The important thing still plenty funding military.  cares unemployment, homelessness healthcare? Helping people long-term cOmMuNIsM.

I’d say /s really seem way things work.  Western, Central Eastern Europe dark red, expect border closures? meaningful countries high case incidence people actually travelling, meaningless border closures within Germany. Nah it’s like 26 weeks Discussed second half article. pill. taken home, IV hospital visit. therapeutic easy give promising. Come back 3 months give gold told so. need vaccine end pandemic. Get hopes up, things going get better better. Japan needs mass immigration, culture dire need enrichment Yes Trump stupider shit sidewalk, make Bush Jr better. asshole. shit president right. 

At time, Bush Jr low point. Folks hated proper reasons.

Just cuz trump worse doesnt mean bush jr ok. Get grip y'all Bars, restaurants masks go long way cutting things down. I’m sure many people try work home possible cut interactions. 3-4 weeks infections start go done. kids schools wearing masks distancing somewhat? long incubation period? Sister flying home holidays want quarantine case exposed flight we're sure long apt enough test valid. Good you. 
You might saved lives, they're gonna miss party probably good memorable anyway. I'm positive, catching people staring directly looking back like expecting say something nothing.. Never without mask Yeah. Thats problem. I’m glad made New Zealand time (arrived yesterday). 2 weeks hotel quarantine enjoy Christmas, Easter, birthdays, next Christmas; get point. quite bit targeted. think see anything like full park closures again. Trump knew back March. difference time actually tried warn us instead Many people drop rungs. foreclosed may still sufficient income rent shitty apartments. Excuse Eviction flings full swing, there’s currently moratorium people getting evicted nonpayment. So, court proceedings go through, eviction currently banned. However, runs December 31st. (Source: CDC) want handouts protections instead realizing world changes it’s make wrong sub say 🤭 Yes sir bihar 1.5 lakh tests day. Would like another spray paint whiff? lol virus doesn't' care vote I'm smaller city North university. Yeah care, I'll keep wearing mask even get stared come place right things, paid everyone best could frankly excellent standard. drying money could tap. Everything. 


Even best case conditions becoming lot harder longer goes. Also important remember Europe's cases really bad right can't really compare March figures since testing increased dramatically alot European countries

A lot people say this, number people intensive care also all-time-high, definitely caused increase testing. Prognosis Pretty sure physical distancing works outdoors. 

If anything, Starbucks incident Seoul proof masks work. ...to hospital 
Tra la-la la la 
Cough cough cough cough I'm smaller city university North. see many masks Stockholm either, still felt alienated getting hit car also damages health. apt comparison. Fair enough. Basically anyone's feelings towards gets sick directly affect outcome, malicious thoughts (actually hoping people get sick) something would consider sadistic fantasy. Looks like things moving towards full lockdown, morgenpost draft proposal looks like lockdown hard, lockdown light parents live us. gone months kids remote learning. job taking care dad. mom normally locks room answer people thought that's happening. Hubby working home thought affect us. whole household tested positive. Apparently mom sneaking shop Home goods Macy's. dad keeping ruse. kids feeling better stomach issues. dad severe symptoms. told go hospital difficulty breathing. mom tried deflect blame onto son. needed rant get another episode nausea, chills, body aches, vomiting 104 fever. Well could French numbers infections. spread disinformation. Actually ""can"" double LONG time, sure slow ~50% US citizens (or been) infected, put another way, ~4% population dead (about 12.000.000 people). 

Thats course assuming immunity stays time. RemindMe! 2 weeks. may much harder win hot wing contests future European Union: [hold '1 month' yeah right, nobody believes that. close that's year Haha! Mostly correct. Secondary schools universities closed spring, secondary schools back universities mix distance on-site teaching (although many restrictions social distancing campus). fap. Moron. western democracy produce many trash? Perhaps morality respect science needs taught schools homes. Slowly Daily number deaths increasing. still surprisingly low. Well, think long country pursues plan, different policies measures country country, way learn works close borders. Certainly places like Vietnam New Zealand, closed restricted entry, least quarantine arrivals, key success.  Jesus... Christmas immediate family lives roof. Like Thanksgiving we'll probably use opportunity experiment alternative food choices. steak thanksgiving I'd never made steak without bbq before. thought Germany. Unfortunately system work way.  bigger issue cases places fewer hospital beds, etc there's risk death rates grow know this, duty feed family, even kills you. cut hair living, I’d protesting shop open too. Thankfully livelihood hasn’t really effected this, can’t imagine folks going through. Look term understand exactly meaning want repeat exact statement realising implications it. Imagine truly believing ruled minority lol don’t understand need explained you, explains video *you* linked to? one hurt read. gonna go like 100000 day? Lol, what? people still unemployment? went back work June. seat belt analogy good: accident, friends going ""see, seat belts work, man dead"", going ""did wear seat belt? seat belt malfunction?"", ignoring fact driving 100mph mountain road switchbacks. Sure, gives false sense security. Masks make people mild symptoms think it’s okay go day anyways.

I’ve Germany Poland summer people supposed wear face masks indoors. heard people coughing everywhere people keep distance, basically never hear people cough Sweden people keep distance really well comparison. number Monday. 28 hours due issues, number yesterday 745 (only 20 hours). Based testing date new daily cases stable around 850 last week. I'm starting think says ""it"" going magically disappear, means American population, disease. Remindme! 7 days one guy

Guess who's teaching kindergarten next year. country? vote out... Plan A. Re-infect him... Plan B? Mine bad needles biggest phobia well **The consequences playing Batman real life.** Sure, probably 100k cases day NY alone peak. weekly infections growing. Secondary schools higher mostly remote spring, class since summer. done Nationwide shutdown, like China did, back started. doesn’t show that, pandemic Trump getting votes “fixing” economy forcing people work businesses stay open, don’t know will. 

It’s become clear American government care health citizens. 

You can’t make people work go home. there’s work school, people gather weekends source relaxation leisure. It’s inevitable. isn’t perfect world never be. soon anyone mentions herd immunity strategy instantly lose credit immediately looked never strategy, media trying get clicks people like swollowing up. Um... president tells best testing world. Nobody tests like test. They’re like writing resume would put upper bound US deaths 9,840 people entire population 328 million infected. Expand military enough everyone employed it. also try avoid getting hit cars. people DYING winning. 


WTG! Look latest figures September on. Per capita death cases. dying level 10 stupid comment It’s case Fox News viewers go site, uninformed might actually think pandemic promised dear leader. like that, poof! gone no, world's always right side up, hanging upside down. little dizzy. that's OK. sit down, calm down, orient yourself. Bush senior responsible lot situations Latin America too, ultimately leading migrant caravans, etc. may want pick magnesium citrate (this one best bio-available forms magnesium)

magnesium glycinate little expensive, better absorbed, give diarrhea, tastes worse (like dried fish). prefer guts seem irritated citrate. Thanks Sturgiss trump's SuperSpreader rallies. 


Are infecting best brightest? much. Solid answer. Thanks. That's sad read. Perhaps epidemic really get manageable levels fast tests &amp; vaccines, need anymore. hope take something else, come peace yourself. Hell Mineral Point students held protest weeks ago district smart cancelled sports time being. People dumb Brexit Lmao true complain downvotes 300k comment karma. tool Reddit.  Don’t worry, it’s going away day election. read long time ago human skin pigmentation/colour climate Vitamin D.

Essentially, much also bad you, skins colour lightens move north suns rays weaker collect it, darker move equator take less it.

Note: Apologies I'm 100% accurate, since read it. depends really. good mask compliance schools. much adults stay home. think it’s possible. Closing schools last resort view. Genocidally inclined - surrounded worst - least patriot

dear fucking lord say shit straight face. That's pity. 
I try take takeout tip 20-30% amount, that's way stimulating whatever . Top reddit mind celebrating hugging teammates kinda stupid enough, begin with, teammates wearing masks guess risk transmission low. kissed wife like wtf. hope people get infected longer feel sorry do. point people 7 months figure get infected. ""people"" acts working devil number constitutes deficiency? second check gone end day pay back debt many people in. qualified get it, claim taxes next year. says IRS website people die virus, yet massive amount people virus extremely contagious. equals massive amount deaths.

Either political leaning(this fucking weird...) extremely self centered resulted trying minimize pandemic killed million people(over million measures(often extreme) place limit effect...)


You either piece shit idiot(albeit useful one). kids school think anyway get R 1 deaths lag 4 6 weeks. interesting see death % go thanks new practices. 99.997 percent recovery rate, better regular flu. less testing keep number down! 
 
If can't see it, there! Exactly. nephew tested positive, whole family got sick, already know got test... That's 1 reported positive five actual positives. 500k per day soon. Eventually 92% population get begin burn out. Biden looking million dead watch though could reasonably blame him. folding month straight once, long time ago, power bill tripled lol point? 

Day fucking 1 ""Covid democratic hoax"" 

Hows hypocrisy tatse? Choke it. Imagine stupid don’t understand what’s going business data fit ""media narrative"" health vs. economy well.

It's economy &amp; health.

Unfortunately, many unbelievably dumb people learning take years instead seconds. take 8000iu daily? cant pay rent come December. idea I'm going do. took 10 years get street dont want go back Try hold accountable. Confront can, contact couple local stations, papers see could story it. know feels hopeless, can't keep letting people get away kind thing. chose collect it, feet held fire it. cant extrapolate saying stay conversation.  only. live country?

Saying they're real Christians well good, stop said ""not real"" Christians using religion justification trying (and often succeeding) force unpopular harmful policies country whole, whether that's pandemic, health education marry. correct. like volontary soft lockdown. schools open though. applied every job could ended getting one. Article says expect mass produce later on. people like life saver. Another Aryan hero, see. Hindsight always 20/20.

Sure, China could done better. maybe not, considering facing unknown situation, needed assess situation correctly, sequence genome first place, develop test kits scratch urgency, surely prior warning get time advantage, unlike West.

As far I'm concerned, Chinese CDC new world's benchmark. Sweden Rorschach test politicized COVID. thought I’d dislike Marseilles also adored . It’s wild city really let freak flag fly. kind hard get good read percentage positive hear.

Guess advice coming late anyway 1. seriously trust Chinese numbers they've done January?

2. New Zealand know... island middle nowhere. get left world maps time. can't compare US Europe. Already have. Best decision life. Appropriate username specifically guess Catering Banner Installation Crew: $64,000 like defund contact tracing team years leading covid.  scary think would happen something worse came along. People like banned NHS forced go private life. Well article number teachers counties question totals less five hundred. That's 180,000 teachers Florida: lot becomes like crippling education system anything. fucking arrogance Americans think rest world somehow overhyping pandemic mess election Yes Merkels fault... disagree want what's hyperbole? Trump surviving worst thing happen far. Oh! clue four haha - thank much! Well, read article. title well made informative. another example important freedoms are. one single claim tours true. went Walgreens night get son medicine. another woman people wearing masks. NC mask mandate guess late night people felt like exempt. least didn’t deny pandemic let Australians know serious beginning. It’s low bar set that’s US so..... mean he’s around wife, likely it, too. live someone, sleep bed someone, touch objects someone... bitching kissing wife little much, unless first time he’s seen while. get tested every game it’s fear (and lack tolerance fear) makes people clutch outlandish disinformation act . always faith orangutan would end thr pandemic /s *could* title. that's equal *won't happen*
move It’ll worse winter it’ll covid plus influenza plus respiratory infections become prevalent time year. There’s many older people respiratory conditions like copd depend heavily healthcare periods put strain healthcare normal times. Mission failed successfully Whether win lost, China always unpopular somewhere. cares. helloooo, live planet tearing down. going years, time enemy that's imminent Sorry man mostly whole world thinks America haha area, spots filled people fleeing New York Philadelphia. housing rental market absolutely ridiculous right now.

As far people go... I'm sure. good. Depends narrative trying push. Sometimes compare countries worse sometimes countries better.

Whats interesting always wrong measures Sweden took. always portraid Sweden didnt anything. course wrong. design. Republicans hate America. Damn man, I'm sorry hear that.
This whole thing many levels handled like cluster fuck party surprised people adopted different strategy. 

It this....

Im high risk dyingnif catch flu, Im going careful afraid go live life.

Okay, damn, caught flu...its going five days feeling like crap, isolating (hopefully) Im it.

You guys diabetes, fighting cancer, grandma, grandpa, high risk, stay home.

Now, cases spiking death rate days?

Not saying right way handle thing think people making choice.

I know 7 people got covid back April...

Everybody back feet 4-5 days stayed home another week went back work. No, antibodies present aftermath infection. linger around forever immune system keeps ""memory"" virus antibodies needed detected again. political narrative; anti-lockdown politicians America flawed. look Russia China treat people imagine would without America police world.

You hate America, things would far worse xi Putin callling shots. Lmfao, maybe clarified that. Yes, group testing works taking individual swabs people, combining test kit super high sensitivity specifically designed purpose. sure technical details, it'll show one 20 people it. Consider lucky ... Bootstraps? thought would simply go away.. Like magic so.. /s even surviving? paid since March? visited Oslo Helsinki tourist. similar demographics compared Stockholm respective metropolitan areas? entire year like living dystopian novel. love reading genre, never wanted actually try IRL. Absolutely agree, forms exercise (even buy weights) involve closed room people breathing hard. Unfortunately Republicans - Kennedy launched Bay Pigs example, Kennedy LBJ escalated Vietnam bombed Laos, Clinton greatly increased incarceration rate, Obama bombed Libya trained extremists Syria, etc.

I'd recommend reading People's History United States. Honestly, think every country needs democracy focus peace, education, healthcare improvement lives. see Sweden Switzerland voting bomb countries, etc. Oh shit that’s awesome. Thanks man! Guess people die then... Canada agreement still largely closed boarders Atlantic Canada. arrive outside bubble must quarantine 14 days. currently 4 known cases province 1M people. That's forever many businesses. going cover overhead especially everything else year. campaign-of-disinformation thing. not? could imagine identify type could able tell whether permanent not. Like various kinds tissues. r/coronavirus shambles saber rattle plenty, keep getting taken Communist China.

Seems like want Communist rule though much said that. always leave country unhappy. mom says me, “the cases going up. We’ll end getting one way another. keep living lives.” “living lives” meant going eat, going see old groups friends lunch, going weddings parties... try explain won’t able “live lives” due everyone still “living lives”. many people given trying protect others they’re tired it. wait, they'll tell us Christmas they're cancelling tax returns next year, let us know need thank them, despite never paying $750 taxes life always getting paid back.  Hospitals got funding COVID cases. Many hospitals get funding. saying pandemic lie, there’s truth nuke Virus ,obviously banned using non-emergency NHS services abusing NHS staff going job, although would cover case.  kills others well you. Or, younger, likely instead you.

Everything us society, often species, fundamentally incompatible pandemic. makes think mass surveillance extent 1984?

I'd argue much, much worse. fact rarely used non-criminals mean information exist.

They track everything everywhere go, extremely easily. countries get social Benit/dole. US, get desperation. punished poor America, sickening fact lot people waking to. chance guys need there? ;) No.

I’m sure sorts countries working US, that’s given.

But case specifically talking Russia bots. hitting multiple states staff replacements happen. hey many doctors press conference Trump Walter Reed? White House says contain guess even flatten curve hospitals overflow. great hospitals take get anything. Yes, locked tight, let planes whole world. seems, although surely not, premeditated. certain done bad faith. un-british honestly. Surely fake troll account really stupid? Number 1! responsible countries expect 14 days worries utter failure tackling COVID it’s pretty firm indication society failing test we’ll ever capable tackling bigger issues like global warming. person gets seriously ill flu susceptible ailments COVID 19. Getting flu shot reduces chances getting flu therefore reduces chances getting secondary infections including covid Wow. straight propaganda. justice world, make set people proven pro-mask willing follow rules get priority triage people known anti-mask social distance. 

But not- I'd willing bet triage choose people ones following rules, months antibodies wear get again, they'll choose ANOTHER person followed rules, on. damn.. going way wasting time hurt/scare people community without benefit themselves. bunch amoral scum people fair state always bar set pretty fucking low since forever. roads made croissants... 
I'm Belgian, also curfews here. 
curfews stop people drinking Bars going nightclubs. 
We 2 weeks highly inefective large majority population sleeps night. 
More people gathered schools (that still open) work. 
Our government ball call lockdown want ones blamed bankrucpy small businesses. Lockdowns help slow spread kill economy think letting virus spread better... Sorry, don’t fall propaganda. get sick I’ll stay home and/or wear mask. Asymptomatic spread thing, CDC said that. click bait headline. white house report says nothing ending pandemic, read article end says sent journalist list things end pandemic. outset COVID-19 pandemic, Administration taken decisive actions engage scientists health professionals academia, industry, government understand, treat, defeat disease.""

I find ridiculous science based subreddit takes click bait headlines face value without even bothering crack open article apply reasoning whatsoever. 

:( A) mouthwash helpful coronavirus harbors throat B) eating take food risky coronavirus mouth ends dissolved stomach acids enter lung? Czechia :D Brainless. leave? state like Texas Ohio crazy shit.

Americans put things hold properly little get back normal quicker. difficult understand. New Zealand, Australia parts Asia get it.

I blame Trump. Many people come grave failures. family doctor Canada sure wishes fake virus. age putting huge strain mental health. feel sorry guy see well mentally. stressed forgetful.

He family doctor decades even neighbor childhood. remember brother dislocated shoulder walked across street doctor fixed it. Wisconsin mask mandate place.

I'm sure coincidence record 5200+ positive cases yesterday. shutdowns always overwhelming healthcare system hospitals. Cases mean shit. Normaly take 4000ui/day baseline dose. levels checks 42 ng/ml, decent room more.. want level take 8000iu one week. works ways, ya know. Yeah. Ideally, make new lockdown little ""self-imposed"", think happening he's slightly afraid legal ramifications (his original lockdown orders *unfairly* ruled unconstitutional ago). They’re slaves. you’re going want working least try pay more, eh? know virus infects multiplies body. studies it. Swedes sense responsibility: act appropriately right thing trust others same. UK everyone seems government tells to.

Obviously also helps Swedes largely live intermediate family social contacts reasonably low begin with. I’ve seen picture Biogen conference. many people schmoozing get loud, heard everyone’s talking. 

I’m sure you’re right: perfect storm risk factors superspreader.

The Rose Garden event similar: afterwards lots schmoozing crowded together indoors, everyone talking once.  literally happening right now.

It’s basic Cold War tactic undermine opponent small ways.

No things would never go full outright war, little cuts entire focus destabilizing countries oppose. Might well add ""ESTABLISHED WORLD PEACE"" ""RELEASED HALF-LIFE 3"" list ""accomplishments"" too... mom hasn’t seen daughter since could crawl, she’s walking talking. sit house day her, taking outside walks doctor appointments. watch neighbors throw big birthday parties friends family. It’s infuriating. defense. document clarifying tasks worked vs tasks actually completed. like halfway project still list year end accomplishments. we, also NJ. Nothing like opening time kids social distance homecoming all-sports pep rally inexplicably last weekend, halloween, trips people inevitably take teachers' convention, Thanksgiving. I'm aife classroom staying virtual serve parents chose keep kids home, I'm allowed work home, found yesterday JANITOR they're dividing room shower curtains shoving another teacher there. go back, instructional aides given bus duty, even though contract bussing never ride bus before.  talking part imposed cordon sanitaire Wuhan, part set mask mandates across country, part went overboard ""all together"" propaganda ""disease invisible enemy""?

Please tell part.

Cause I've mask 4 times *month*. Twice go museum. go hospital yesterday get updated Covid test (I've traveling since August useful). today pick results use clean certificate health go buy cold medicine (sweet sweet Sudafed). I'll wear mask tomorrow left fucking test results pharmacy need go back hospital get another copy. Meanwhile southern Austria: impossible get hold flu vaccine. I'm currently two different waitlists. Possibly *might* get shot December. Yeah, Costco/Walmart/etc. come better I'll bet, independent businesses unable recover, yet inevitable stimulus/bailout still go big companies. call era? Dumb Dumb Age? Lol lot seem relate pandemic. forced kids back school, cut funding online, refused actually hold zoom lessons want go back full capacity..... funny areas want prevent spreed others GOP areas..... thread UK definitely got first wave second. envy place people taking seriously. Unlike almost half US. Sigh! I'd leave, I'm poor world banned Americans due poorly handling Pandemic. crazy. year went biggest raise I've life able fully support nice apartment trustworthy vehicle able scrape by. Every month gets closer single dollar name even cutting spending bare minimum smart food money. really strange watch, yet people acting like nothing happening all. people crap, unbelievable. Rounding corner. Cries 10300 Dutch cases per day USA! USA! really look forward death days normal. Sometimes feel jynx countries praise them... week ago talking good things going Denmark. terrifying fast things get messy virus. maybe UK spend much time pandering people supposedly cant wear mask (and coincidentally also can't wear face shield download free exemption certificate). 

Take announcements publish transport example, spend much time talking people cannot wear face covering socially distance disabilities invisible respectful can't follow guidelines asking people mind following laws mask wearing socially distancing. 

I've harassed train *was* wearing mask minding business. Apparently thought perfect princess two drunken louts felt sitting seat wearing mask aggressive one girlfriends ""what fuck problem"". 

In UK emboldened anti maskers actually made things less safe want comply regulations. 

I work pub people giving fake names numbers track trace time. People getting aggressive ask step back bar ask sit table serve them. sort pub people tear holes masks joke sip pint wearing one original definitely done million times. 

It sucks hate right now. People stupid, possible both? takes little effort even helps little, makes difference. Good thing normal presidents purposely hurt people mean vote them. Bummer minority elect opposite, apparently hurting majority great goal have.

Quote sums up: ""you're hurting *the wrong people*!"" Texas, regularly quarantine kids time. Probably anywhere 15-30 kids week plus staff members. test report TEA regarding positive cases. quite funny honestly (in dark sad way).

I'm guessing live payday payday small towns far cities housing generally cheaper respective income less. happen can't pay? going people travelling living cars? homeless people group start moving hoards. 

It's interesting think about. sad, interesting. sorry questions I'm super curious since know things really US. Good day went gym pandemic. That's you. Unless work there, highly irresponsible. hero awesome. Landlords scourge must abolished. Fuck them! yet, I've Tokyo Kyoto. He’s wrong. There’s ton legit n95s eBay. You’re gonna pay 40-50 pack ten 80-90 pack 20. What’s job longer available? locked area? Agreed. weather gets colder, kick again. except regular flu doesnt perma fuck lungs heart among things? lol 3rd world country yours, great job 'murica. Gold star example freedom freedom makes country great. going shopping supermarket, mask going offer far better protection distancing.

There ways improve distancing odds: Go early, go late. Go different supermarket. Go alone. Don’t rush. regardless, people shopping quietly picking want really closely interacting anyone. would mask better situation? surprisingly. Testing ramped massively, death count seems lower compared number infections. safe assume number infections first wave fivefold tenfold higher detected testing, due lack tests back Trump wins, upside winter. lose wait one day blame Biden bump cases. don’t know you’re talking about. surprising us States anti-social personality disordered President (and/or narcissistic traits overlap.) best case study this. 

And aren’t wearing masks base. Meaning respect behavior him- (Ie- either traits wish did.) Midwest spike. never before. way folks know Midwest behave, almost deserve this. masks. Saying fake. Etc. hope northeast remembers need keep wearing masks. think larger lag reporting people died outside hospitals - die elderly home example, first reported municipality forwarded region FHM. Hospitals already automated reporting system (SIR however called) kind cases goes directly region/FHM. 

I also heard Sweden ""best counting"", seems better lot countries excess deaths much higher official reported COVID-19 deaths. really, video-game, reach point can't count anymore, let's say would want test 10 people met one new cases, would 2 million people per day, who's going that? progressively need higher higher testing capacity data analysis, reality stray farther farther real number. Astonishing Presidential election close is.  Trump 3% less incompetent would bag. still may win (or steal it)

&amp;#x200B;

What utterly. utterly broken country America way better Japan (and rest East Asia matter) America France. major city US before? throw away Congratulations button ago. used much. shut many business curve flattening rate slower Florida huge red flag restrictions working, exhaust funding many people homeless due crazy lockdowns. expectations cases 0 kind justify economic losses all, foreced reopen. didn’t use Saturday instead Monday? 64.2% self designed metric. Also use June 7th instead 8th 40%. Back March instances course even higher 64%

If look neighbors Denmark, handled better, recent full day increase 80% Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! economy demands sacrifice! really need start backup medical people like army reserves. Why? tell no. already ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ correct. someone gets hit car 2 weeks getting positive test also included. statistics simply many died within 30 days positive test. 

To able see good measurement not, always compare statistics Socialstyrelsen (based death cause death certificate) excess mortality. course compare whatever country choose based trying get across. another discussion :) point simply would statistical misconduct remove statistics case. like would misconduct add cases retrospectively new data becomes available. Brownie, heck job. striking right balance treating extraordinary victims virus ordinary victims key. Sweden failed at.


Just something 100% success rate mean failure, consider such, matter provide evidence claim Sweden among least course exports also get affected economy whole takes hit, every industry (almost) every country crisis preventing deaths. Sweden failed at.


You disagreeing actual scientists sources. opinion, recognise trying cherrypick least terrible measures make Sweden look better. 


You trying cherrypick worst possible comparisons make Sweden look worse, blame agreeing point I’m fucking tired making shit accusing same.


Well interesting.

Say, main point anyway? feel way, maybe even arguing using Norway example literally comparable country world Sweden.


And compatible still *most* compatible. Either way, again, Norway better make country makes Sweden lot worse, since experts agree Sweden done Norway did, thousands deaths could avoided, cost economy. 


Even constitutionally possible so, pure speculation, best educated guess. experts agree that, not. really want find go look Tegnell coworkers reasoning.

You somewhat seem misunderstand science, one even hundred scientists think something make true, may many side. debate could probably continue hundred years.


Either way, prove Sweden objectively failed, want continue can, go around circles anyway. county small overall case count, &lt;500 total cases. We're reporting new case two every day.

We small spike past weekend. I'm college town. College kids still going gatherings, partying without masks. 

Some businesses apparently underreporting cases avoid shutting down.

Kinda hate recklessness honestly. worry, great leaders decided stop testing asymptomatic people. Like Trump said : ""Less tests = less positive results !"" keep mind official numbers...with 30% possitive rate actually atleast 3 times cases 2 weeks ago... seat belt warning beeps car makes, shut off? Everyone is. wonder stop hearing beating around bush vit ""studies"". promising, large radomized double blind call day. Don’t forget year ran CIA. maybe people wore them.... Also, since COVID flu related, also possible worst-case scenario ""if get flu COVID time, there's chance could mix match eventually cause even brutal strain already got"" (which happens; reason flu vaccines fear flus spread poorly lethal, less lethal spread easily- people worried chance two merging find flu spreads easily lethal.) Goodluck bro really hope dont go back Also teaching Jersey. I've got weird feeling families kids tested continue in-person learning. want precious angels miss sports parties refuse participate contact tracing receive phonecall. dismissing students day grandma yelled granddaughter ""take SHIT face"". Yea, guessed it. referring child's mask.

Scary, scary times. Feels like waiting game, winter coming. Sorry, I’m sarcastic. America go way wear masks take virus spread seriously. leaders Mock mask wearing host large events precautions taken. article sad example Americans wear masks. may combination various factors.

I'm doubting can't recall significant differences first weeks July first lockdown.
What say could well true, many people saying we've strict lockdown x number months case opinion.
The first lockdown Melbourne strict global standards, certainly strict NZ Europe. 20% difference mortality rates America Sweden. Americans subreddit openly acknowledge covid handled terribly. Swedes hand adamantly deny country's failings. Nature way thinning herd. leave Melbourne fly UK,I need negative test board plane ( got ) loss, guess.  found Google AMP links comment. normal links:

I'm shocked! Shocked! difficult everyone. hope loved ones remain good health. stigmatize someone stabbing security guard 27 times? Seriously? Maybe using excuse. live Flatbush either lol. band name. I've lived city whole life heard anything like this. district this??? recorded? rookie numbers. gotta pump numbers up.

[pounds chest rhythmically, coughs] means US finally mask mandate. Australia nanny state. It’s far hellhole though certainly didn’t liken NK. There’s much love country, submissiveness populous government control simply shocks me. Aussies straight refuse see qualities. One minute want Scott Morrison’s head pike complete ineptitude handling fires, next he’s forgotten praised handles covid. Absolutely insane. agree, health wealth haha. Thank much! wish best family well! Please stay safe!! :) Thank service economy completely dead

I'm sorry hear that. Must frustrating sacrifice much still come short economically. hope family stay safe. We're *almost* there. months vaccine...  Today debating starting try drink green tea again. may deciding factor. could help.. worth shot. every state, every county every person shut everything months government sending stimulus checks, fall winter could manageable. 100 cases day relatively safe case count slowly open up.

IF every abide SOP is. Lock-down kind like amputation, one wants it, disease spreading fast, choice make sacrifice. lock-down brought bit time, get chance build targeted approach like test-trace-isolate, making distancing masking protocols, building good social network like sensible paid sick-leave policies. fail, need second lockdown probably going painful first one. Well course Flatbush. born Brooklyn, Clinton Hill, Clinton Avenue. mom lives Atlantic Ave RR. told story. Recently. think it’s slam time writers secretly want bring Pogs^TM back. I'm boat! feeds anti-lockdowners international media *shit*.

You idea...

Sweden soft lockdown approach, meaning enforced lockdown, effects still noticeable. International media sees writes article article absolutely lockdown Sweden everything keeps going pandemic. lie, course.

The result psycho anti-lockdown people thinking Sweden taking action virus, everyone else thinks Sweden evil killing elders locking down... Huh? illiterate Americans goose-stepping sub dedicated Europeans? doubt even know Emmanuel Macron is. Especially Essex County area. cover least 4 cities/towns like 20 minutes mean, factually he’s wrong. friend Belgium working doctor. told half staff caught virus despite wearing masks hospital. Masks? Im skeptical. believe social distancing works well. Masks without social distancing? much Pathetic mask-debaters convinced masks work. logic pass middle school science fair. argue masks can't stop Covid-19, argue gases made atomic particles 100 times smaller can't get out. Yeah, look stylish. Also this: seems pretty hard deny least partial goal point. Tegnell literally talking expecting herd immunity May interview. lowest virus levels world. quarantine. slash wound likely survivable especially deep, since often deep. watch choreographed fight scenes, notice pretty much using superficial slashes barely contact all. Huh? Again, sounds like Russian bullshit me. switch Russian prefer. 2200+ cases per day rising death toll considered ""pretty good job"" reasonable definition. Wait China New Zealand different governing styles?

I think requiring negative test travel airplane global pandemic killed lot people already authoritarian. TSA, however, is. Ok Sounds like do.  🚽💦 there's study needed waste time resources right now. Water wet. No, think Trump handled pandemic well, ever say did. Trump become convenient scapegoat COVID-related fuck ups US. easy. Hell, received message DNC stating less agreed Trump's policy (or non-policy) pandemic. Democrats much blame Republicans; politician wants what's necessary, i.e., enforce masks quarantine fines jail time. Back March remember watching GMA Amy Robach said Dr. Jen Ashton, “Can’t take Vit supplement?” Dr Jen like , “no doesn’t work way”. Shortly another Dr went tv said masks don’t help don’t buy them.

I lost faith started upping vitamin religiously wearing mask “normal” wear one whatever reason pretty common vitamin deficiency correlative causative increased severity diseases. fuckin' real! God people! South Korea’s public messaging campaign on-point year!

Here great example also posted OP consider schools open, bars open, universities open, restaurants open surprising point manageable. 1.2% growth week. TMC Houston. way, world view shattered. PEOPLE CANT POSSIBLY WORST THINGS EVER EXIST, DARE YOU. 





/s July 7th still stricter first lockdown definitely real lockdown. got stricter, mean already lockdown. see lot people downplaying Victoria's second lockdown counting Stage 4 part ""real lockdown"" accurate. Vic achieved excellent numbers, yes, wish people would acknowledge took lot get act like Stage 4 difficult strict part. business mostly returning citizens. 

It biggest reason disaster rest world Misleading headline. ""Please wear mask"" STABSTABSTAB. Thye got argument ended fight....still crime quite presented. much study cost? Simple-minded stooge. one would ever accuse exceptionalism. Given Utah, test probably something like ""God would infect anyone deem worthy living. fear virus sinner.""

You know, stable science. Yes, sadly do. 

The silver lining we’re generally quick bring banhammer idiots, loud enough discourage idiocy. Water wet Sounds lot like live. Fortunately we're close enough suburbs able curbside pickup, husband works home company city weekdays temp job mostly working alone weekends, around people much. 2025? 2050 convenience stores go lots people masks employees wear HEB restaurants strict it. could worse. bartender though seen blatant disregard mask distancing protocols Spiraling toilet bowl. Hmm. ran ambulances storing bodies next ice cream? them, EU anti-mask protests everywhere Remember chicago... police even enforce public transportation.  

CALL POLICE!!! STOP TRYING HERO!

Don't sell them, call police let officers enforce it. That's comparing outcome number cases.

The US also leading quite bit [GHS ranked #1 country that's prepared pandemic. situation bad lies inability act fed govt.

I would say, want compare bad/well doing, would rather look preventable is, rather purely outcome. regard, yes, would also agree OP's statement.

Fun fact btw, EU's death percentage number pop much much lower US'. EU's total pop \~741m VS US' 328m, yet almost number cases, almost number deaths. still think US screw especially bad, compared EU, hey guess. Agreed. say thing majority countries world. all, greatest country history world, United States America, done exact thing, would anyone expect poor country like Philippine better? Macron idiot, French people Elysée. first time, took arrests major fines force les Français observe stay-at-home order. politician wants it, even Witch. Amaribad status=OWNED empathy compassion

This truly pro-European moment *sips wine* really mad state Utah state Utah! Fuck people. They're homicidal point. dad nutshell Spanish flu go away end? see point. suppose cultural ideologies. US dumb countries gotten together better. want see people denial, go rural Wisconsin. Also, courts shut sort limitations imposed Governor curb spread conservative law firms suing measures including limited indoor dining, mask mandates, etc. besides kiwis business think majority know saying instead point is, given government decided ""deal"" virus, basic efforts would us sitting much better place currently are. Still New Zealand levels, better.  yeah much uncertainty it’ll good apps approved. awesome able help pay bills convince continue uber. health family important. wish nothing best father health, safety, financial security, loving relationship. ♥️ dont. would imply creative talent skills, see it. never said authoritarian countries international travel restrictions. course do. countries do. We're talking international travel restrictions. point logical bearing association *domestic* travel restrictions authoritarianism.

Although may asking people quarantine, carry systematic enforcement forcibly detain interstate travelers. state US. There's reason case. US, constitutional democracy protects individual liberties. One liberties protected US constitution right travel freely states.

So, point trying make US constitution system government puts real roadblocks implementing kinds controls China peoples' movement. come surprise China, authoritarian state little concern liberties citizens, would quick implement harsh restrictions domestic travel.

I'll allow initial comment glib, fundamental differences two countries, systems government, values important consider comparing approach travel restrictions. I'm 10 million points counting. Keep going! taking literally. Everywhere EU government mandated sick leave pay. something unique Sweden means catch someone unknowingly. family would like see part 0.4% survive it? family would ""acceptable loss"" pursuit current government's asinine goal ""herd immunity""/""herd mentality""/""survival fittest""?

Didn't even attempt answer question...

I see mistake here. friends family care about, empathy anyone outside circle. Life overrated fuck. worth nothing without freedom. Ah bon, tu passes cette connerie de langue par Google Translate? MDR, mec, tu n'es capable de parler ni anglais, ni français. En plus, je ne suis pas ta soeur, donc il vaut mieux tutoyer ta pute. 

Concernant son anglais, il ne connaît pas l'expression ""COVID-19"". ""Covid"" n'est ni nom, ni adjectif. HORROR! easy answers. admit bias. Three close family members educators locally. fear everyday. Springs hates Polis hard. Constant dethrone Polis, Polis dictator, dare Polis tell us wear masks, Polis trying stop wildfires, on. People Springs really care cops enforce masks unless store calls trespassing generally don't. prove? China also deal already signed AstraZeneca produce Oxford vaccine domestically case success. pragmatic country deals brainer.

But see Mossad either 'stealing' samples Moderna vaccine, Israeli government asking US government provide samples open channel, why?

Also might come surprise you, Israel fact maintains close relationship China. example, time ago ready sell M-2075 Phalcon AWACS China 4 billion USD deal US found forced stop. Prior many arms deals two. even suspect Israel sold China ended helping [J-10 Inothers words water wet Ah you’re position either. Don’t come bullshit then. Can’t economy everyone sick dead genius never heard anyone getting violent someone wouldn’t put mask.

I mean, generally people worried others wearing masks, also make point touch people. salty even lockdown still fun things outside things city, restaurants, bars, movie theaters, shopping, closed. I'm sorry got stared at. drawing conclusion everyone ignorant, consider one wears back make stand lot. hard react start wondering different etc. take bit far saying crazy. saw lady mask thought: maybe either really scared infected thinks likely spread C19. shopping food even though symptoms? think means personally aunt uncle’s local restaurant pretty much won’t survive. watched dedicate whole lives it. fire waiters waitresses, people knew personally know they’re going tough winter unable find job, especially experience outside restaurant industry. one sub cares anyone covid patients. comment included Denver. know math strong suit, majority cases Denver County. So....where proof? Even Douglas County, he'd consider ""hick area,"" shows 90% OBSERVED mask-wearing, i.e., moment time. So....where's Denver County? think deeply? 

If going troll me, least make interesting. far, boring.   South Korea, Japan, China know basically back normal caveat masks. basically everything open including nightclubs things seem fine there. three guys think likely remain open without implementing restrictions? way rna tech works, think would show positive antibodies got real deal? must definition Karen haven’t seen before. girls Karens? many elderly Americans desperate see grandchildren Christmas die offspring's hugs? Thats FDA certified way overpriced. Spam post friction. Yes, I've learned reading anything beyond ""Trump says"" (or ""POSOTUS says"", either way) teaches nothing I, you, millions others, already know; he's ignorant lying pos.

Waste time. fear. county doubling every 9 days. Medical workers need more. 

Don't hoarder. It’s stupid. I’m walking around Manhattan, always wear mask psychologically feel comfortable crowded sidewalks getting close people. 
When I’m home suburbs, generally leave mask walking around it’s easy stay apart others. Without mask I’m never anywhere near anyone. mean, actively stabbing someone cops pulled up, probably been. sounds like they’d already finished trying best murder him. Yes border controls need implemented. Could help alot spread people realize serious situation getting accross Europe. okay. think rude, someone expressing odd pet peeve, lol. liberals finally got wish cancelled Christmas! War Christmas over.



/S Many places US ""cold enough make people stay inside"" weather time year. Tell he's hero us. Japanese people used spotless cities 

I'm guessing Japan [That's 5.88% total cases...... need statistician understand bad news. love Paris. add Amsterdam list, it’s great. gather people know locally. yes. IFR 0.7% means 120k cases ~3-4 weeks ago. Confirmed positive 40k.

Mexico likely far deaths officially recorded, probably 10-20x under-counting cases. Right France December, yet failed identify it.

Yes certain country lied came from. Dr Li warned spreading rumours seeing warning went hospitals Wuhan advising staff lookout new respiratory disease. 

This call cover up. time China informing WHO.

It take month China inform WHO, reason arrest one front-line doctors talking it. anything input would essential WHO. Yeah get social credit points I'm Chinese, think, unlike you, important facts straight.

Ah useful idiot then. Woot! sub enrolled? Ps, rna vaccine - it’s body produce antibody? Studies shown whether choose go lockdown/ circuit breaker vs places didn't, economy still took huge hit.

I think better takeaway article places recover lockdown planning to, must enforced social distancing, virus reduction measures etc infection spike forcing another lockdown.

Or warning places active outbreak everything disease control prevent infection forcing consider measure first place.

Both instance requires active participation government public. whole situation awful- workers. live County 3 weekends ago Red Lobster town PACKED Saturday night 7pm. Like pre-covid levels packed. don’t understand anyone felt comfortable sharing air shitty seafood bunch strangers. must nice  Well, no. know 3,000 Americans die pissed ""Islamic"" terrorists, that's tragedy. 230,000 Americans die virus spread Americans, that's statistic. 'Cause 'Merica. im saving planet. production socks produces carbon might think Ohio mask mandate mandates, they're hardly enforced. lose job result this? Europeans think kids first get sacrificed.

A majority Americans seems think important keep indoor dining, gyms bars open, schools secondary concern. much world thinks differently. right. see people going Publix Circle K without time. Can't stop them...might get shot. fines, they? monetary consequences, one follows rules. definitely paying people.

It seems easy. w-word like ""cunt"" can't say TV. reminds dark haired version sweetums lady parks rec  thought get bailed out? Southwest United AA did?  I’ve many unkind thoughts him, never thought Putin stupid ignorant.  Yes.  I’m sure wearing masks social distancing businesses acceptable temporarily. Even that’s normal allow people properly interact.

But regarding people seeing family friends, going school, going concerts, fun things life, people done public health measures that’s harsh reality. Selfish not.

People waiting for, planning get, vaccine safely go back normal. There’s point vaccine continue things getting vaccine. another form pushing back goalposts achieve false hope eradication zero deaths it’s never going happen. Especially one cares zero deaths vaccines work old people things flu, thousands people die year. know Australian government looking total elimination. countries control successful tracing control method set up. long countries link cases manage isolation going considered   Except areas full hospitals triage people give start anything.  feel disenfranchised. sense national identity, click anyone. world capital things ""tolerable"" level. country so... mundane. like starting levels RPG everything's bland ever mildly interesting, takes ages get out, finally able get find rest world _better_ Israel ask US vaccine candidate?

I’m sure taking .5% risk dying (for oldest workforce, ages 50-69) exactly “facing death”. that’s reasonable risk take given competing economic social risks crushing own. 

For age 20-49 demographic (the majority workforce), risks like .02% fatality rate. extent shift focus protecting skew risk highest (age, Poland reports record 18,820 new coronavirus cases, daily death toll tops 200 first time

 - New cases: 18,820

and

 “data compiled Facebook indicates state lowest mask-wearing rate United States”

Hmmmm.... maybe two things related Forget government institutions plague-like (but literally plague, since cure now) pandemic occurs. simply we're / happens, it'll every man / family themselves.

I bought firearm 1000 rds ammunition year ago, already suspecting social stability may break next recession/depression (that pre-covid!) may need fend one day. Covid, depression far, far worse imagined. I'm trying learn skills quickly possible, little faith governments point, they're way zero faith fellow man. Remember Australia used mandated clothing public health.

While still massive issue, long ago skin cancer horrifically common Australia. massive campaign ""Slip Slop Slap"" put shirt, slop sun cream slap hat made massive difference skin cancer incidence. meant Australians used idea wearing something health reasons think contributed acceptance masks. 5th, Trump complaining happened Biden. Deal way want, stop trying cause problems lives. want, isolate months afraid virus reserves, care. not, shut up, wear mask public, go work sick, stop trying ruin people's livelihoods suggesting close businesses verge bankruptcy already. significance this? don’t really know BNO it’s scarier news. to-do list, list accomplishments. wait Black Friday. I’ve experienced least decade awful last 10 months. Oh shit... already accepting happen? 
Even staunch pessimist wanted hold hope weeks. think clear Trump made bad situation worse, course handling lot Europe coming winter also disaster failure European countries leadership. 1/4 positive 13.5k cases mean theu 54k tests total math off? sounds bit low. miss Dr Acton. wait Black Friday. many cases fatal? Shoot, bar even exist anymore? administration invoke special authority cases like get things done refused to, actually actively come encouraged unsafe behavior. He's done quite well handling pandemic, soon forget fires. Agreed.

I'd love someone try explain mechanics me. ...but course cannot. also 516 days ago. Sweden Denmark pretty much exactly spot per capita right now. Ya straight men supposed gargle? What's next, ""synchronised blinking"" mandates? lol argument federal government providing necessary tools states withstand lockdowns. includes stimulus, enhanced unemployment benefits, state budget relief, etc. federal government needed enact policy reflected guidance tourism, indoor dining, economic activity groups congregate bad idea vaccine widely distributed. would empower states limit activities without crucial loss tax revenue unemployment situation causes mass personal fiscal distress.

Lockdowns areas repeated refuse wear masks social distance enough rush open businesses viable likely vaccine comes out. also get unlucky big outbreak specific area lockdowns makes sense. wide area less effective harsher public convincing wear masks social distancce.

Coronaviruses recombine another coronavirus, however they're related flu. like saying saying cat dog could fuck make catdog. certain parts Texas. El Paso ICU capacity overflow going San Antonio now. wishing painful lingering death people horrendous crime of... going restaurant?

Yes, absolutely pandemic - people following guidelines, implicit message safe (not risk-free, unacceptably dangerous) so. safe so, advocate that, blame people data making wrong decision, etc., means — public large supposed know know better government?

If people breaching guidelines without second thought means castigate that; people want live normal lives and, frankly, wired so. government says ""this much"" normality, going take opportunity. might placing much faith America enough Russia. Russia went recent memory. practice. Americans brand new them. got remember simple farmers. people land. common clay new west. know...morons. Wait what? There’s lot criticisms US capacity testing one right now. There’s shortage testing available. Supposedly, perhaps minds Boris Johnson Dominic Cummings. Nothing planned properly UK. following scientific advice. We're making go. Result = utter chaos. suspected can't take flak resorted report post need special kind mouthwash old regular one work? White House hears recommendations promptly forgets yes, that's point.  almost zero community transmissions COVID SG nowadays.  Yesterday 1 locally transmitted case 6 imported. Today zero local transmissions 7 imported. going cover overhead especially everything else year.

It's currently reported German media government planning cover 75% lost income due shutdown. I'm Germany atm I'm also starting think lockdowns (in the, let's shut almost everything) ineffective. makes sense shut certain things (ie: bars) get example, museums shut down. guards museums, controls many people enter, people wearing masks. would think better place friends get together someone's apartment wearing mask many hours.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, leaving schools open? surprise numbers started getting higher schools opened schools first things Asian countries shut there's spike...Germany decided last thing shut down. fucking stupid. say kids wear masks doors since leave windows open good ventilation. -\_- mean, know kids basically germ factories. Thank you! thought looked funny reread coronavirus disappear 9PM. Wet season apon us... moisture breeding ground Dude same. recognize anxiety feeding feel helpless. wild year looks way long time. Blaze it. Grossly irresponsible governments encourage reopen. Given enormous sums money spent, financially supported owners keeping businesses shut. great success Silk Road, seems like everything harder days bother. isn't. survive without hitting gym year. Also, healthy mean using gym machines. want healthy home outside gyms safer visit. Trump got absolutely blasted asking flu shot could help Masks required public transport Germany. everyone complies rule, fines handed out. didn’t scale infection rate, scaled new cases - given per 100,00 - it’s given absolute number. Good. Europe showing *right* way handle flare-ups cases. 

America ought take note. bad unlikely states (with possible exceptions like California New York) reverse reopening far pandemic; selfish people stand it, politically desirable. cases rise across board reopening early, *should* reverse reopening! think lockdown imminent Poland, got choice. Depends look: October already worse looking anywhere Eastern Europe. That's true. people already forgotten? Economy longer quarterly earnings market. Think long-term European countries (running pace 200-390k per day scaled population), might see that.

Absolutely! U.S.'s cases 31st highest world per capita past week Czech Republic, example, 5X cases per capita. That's like U.S. almost 3 million cases past week. bad many places. worse places reported (including U.S.) due limited testing. you? defense reply squad? Im sick “needless deaths” defense. People die needlessly matter anybody does, even mean? Suicides needless, falling roofs needless. Ugh Fortunately there's need keep school kids away one another. shit. meant forever, one said you. delay problem people adhere them, run they're disregard social distancing protective measures. Lockdowns effective several places already. go off, guess. reality, cardio weight lifting important parts staying healthy. work healthcare, nobody suggesting people avoid weight lifting order catch covid long you’re young healthy,

What? statement implies people work gym long healthy.

There's tons body workouts people home involve weights cardio build muscle. Weights machines easy way hitting specific targets. poster child right wing media experiencing enormous surge. Wonder spun?!?! less SAP disappointing performance tanked 20%

They're also trying push Dems right. removed top posts time sub don’t think testing capacity get there. I’ll take bet. could maybe see 90k. I’m Duterte supported means look entire video said that.

I’m sure happening large scale. either i. google 'tiktok nurses' It’s soldiers. Imagine September 11 August explosion Beirut - even something smaller scale like missing kid bush overnight people need go look them. 

There times can’t want do. $1200 meant cover 2 weeks average expenses. unfortunately testing Sweden even worse 

Weird, Germany presenting exactly metrics (tests per capita positivity similar), one says ...

So good number? DK tests 3 times many per capita still gets 1.6 % positivity (compared Swedens 3.8 % last week). quantitative numbers say nothing, also important right people tested. Ok lets suppose somehow manage inoculate entire world it. gives shit still get theres symptoms. getting hospital admissions deaths imfections odds happening extremely slim. 3-4 weeks lockdown means 'closed til spring'. wonder they've smoking ? Anything get dumb people vote Jealous. incredibly strong odds say election day also record breaking day cases. Welll last week said hopefully cases/day would peak week around 18,000 per day already slightly worse worst case scenario. Hopefully peak anti-virus laws start show effect That's silly. Lockdowns delay problem, eradicate virus.

I'd respect McDonald's worker someone posts anti trump propaganda free dedication paid staffer. Autumn. desperately need automated cameras using countries approach entrance, camera side glass door (to prevent crazies like vandalizing it) thermal scan ""facial recognition"" check mask on, automated door slide open.

In countries work fine, US probably better upgrade doors thick plexiglass seriously insane anti-maskers can't shoot camera.

Put mask freeze outside sidewalk without twinkies antisocial Neanderthal plague rats. Uh blatant propaganda? That’s true, they’re told prepare vaccine there’s still long way go. UK use Pfizer’s vaccine well give initial vaccination time : Theaters, operas concert halls closed. Amusement arcades, cinemas amusement parks well. Fitness studios, sports facilities, swimming pools **brothels closed** entertainment events prohibited.



No wonder T-Rump hates lockdowns, refuses close White House. haven’t even hit full winter yet...

I’m especially concerned [the upper mountain states. stubborn holdouts, please sake constituents lives, enact mask mandates already! Round turn cliff.

The thing possibly questionable reasoning whether mask mandate makes people care less physical distancing. Yup. I'm California probably days Halloween partying gets us spiking well. :( rational ""Asia outside China"" ""China"" separately? Seems kinda odd way dividing things. Yeah, Hawaii told go like it, called Utah asked go get into... Hawaii? Sounds like fault. Reason: “I can’t hire you, you’re idiot. Goodbye” like drugs aren’t 100% effective.

You’re fair him. world leader gets much criticism handling situation Trump. Everyone else trying tell truth get money.. idiots. ive seen daily threads become hivemind like places do

this one (un)fortunately (depending stance take) become one still concerned numbers wondering another quarantine help get downvoted

its exactly antiscience moreso people side center get upvoted echo chambered nowadays...they completely disregard numbers claiming doomsayers hiding behind economy cant handle another lockdown

while true, attitude way things said describe majority people threads...hence condescension San Diego's schools reopening yet? Ventura County cases pretty good well, K-6 schools reopening week. :( Again, PROVE IT. Well explains office less forcing us back office zero safety precautions zero mask wearing!

DW.com needs stop type spins.  Eh, something like that... one thing stated lie. I’m sorry offended free tell whatever like. europe extreme masked mandates seeing huge increases. Asian countries cases culture. First major wintery cold front coming Texas yesterday today.

[Wrong again, El Paso epicenter summer meltdown issued another curfew I'm curious that. cases look higher ever, shooting several weeks now, increase deaths definitely spring. like Singapore, almost cases among young healthy people so, paired adequate medical care, death rate remained quite low? 

High deaths spring combination things, including age health status infected, I'd expect see least small increase death graph go along huge increase cases graph. located? schools open? Thanks, appreciate it! good luck wife amd family. Frontline get enough credit! Calling first 100k day next 7 days. Texas large place -- larger many countries, terms land area population.

Yeah mostly places ""essential"" anywhere without drive thru done small businesses sell something food. pretty bad hope recover theres mask mandate looking good. months business death sentence lot little stores. :/ Thanks! needed uplifting comment today. Yes, Mossad steal American vaccine? think intelligence agencies around world keep tab vaccine trial program progress? Lmao worlds largest country people packed together like sardines cases.

Imagine actually thinking this.  Europe America human trials too. That's everyone using vaccine. 

Europe America also actual safety standards, unlike China, use lead paint children's toys. 

America also least 100 million vaccines already produced waiting FDA testing approval. Maybe trying go vacation blame people accepting it? Hopefully noticed word credible post. 

That December 1st case retrospectively added, know way many countries like UK, France US done. zero evidence knew end December, notified WHO.

That AP news article full contradictions, 1 person saying forced drink traditional Chinese medicine, everybody else talked said supplied drink it.

There public places people go, like grocery shopping, public transport, pay utilities, etc. segregating places non-essential businesses difficult close together. good reason stop masking social distancing places understand vaccine working protecting vulnerable. 

If vaccinated people insist ignoring recommended safety measures getting vaccinated, least stick bars, movies, restaurants, private parties places going choice one really *needs* be. I’ve read forum people saying, “Once I’m vaccinated, I’m done, people afraid getting sick continue isolating.” NO. someone’s responsibility remain homebound risk serious infection need pay bill buy food. responsibility too, whether want not. experts say it’s okay stop, stop. I’m sorry dealing covid. It’s hard reality face know you’re alone!

Depends originally. I'm Irish, born raised Dublin, hate country can't wait get good look back. somewhere else moving retire/settle down, nice. Wow, like 'scientific' studies guys keep publishing confirmation bias BS.

Someone afraid comply something can't sure trust makes uncomfortable, must fucking dick! like wearing mask physically causes wearer panic attacks overheat, kitten murderer! China coverup: experimentation: case numbers: Functional brain. They'll March. Extend lockdown over. would love hear explain works. seems take 2 weeks see spikes. Sturgis August recently saw linked cases exploding upper midwest. I'm nervous around Christmas we'll see evidence Halloween spike going nothing compared Thanksgiving cases notice Christmas. Maybe perfect, still better countries' half ass measures far. Nope, WAYYY late NZ's strategy Holy shit. That's like whole South Africa's real number infections per day. whole country.

(The official numbers 1000 2000 cases per day) never drive? Plus, people tired told mask, stay home, go parties. People tired seeing families. 

I don’t know call kind fatigue, think it’s real it’s going make things much, much worse. Cool. Melbourne, Australia got back single digit cases large spike daily cases high 100's peak strict lockdown months enforced disaster laws.

One cities world achieve this, whether maintain coming lockdown slowly another question Thank god destroying businesses wore masks! death rates all? I'm extremely red rural area. We've slammed lately doubling calling bullshit. 

I see far less masks couple months ago stores like Walmart stopped even offering masks door couple weeks back. 

Nearly every day argue people insisting need PPE even going building currently battling COVID. day fight two guys literally picking body COVID death. better PPE van do, saw reason wear it. 

Nothing happens matters comes admitting wrong. keep doubling down. Melbourne's strategy great one. fact, [they managed exit lockdown goes show hard work always pays off... long citizens compliant medical professionals ask do.

Yes, know, idiots complaining ""Melbourne still locked down"", stuff like that. see way all! lived Melbourne, I'd *happy* I'd able attend wedding funeral. I'd *grateful* someone house watch rugby weekends.

They're completely back normal there, honestly speaking they'll probably never be. least they're one step *closer*, grateful that. try going close normal, fast, we'll end allowing virus surge necessitate tightening restrictions (as happened many European countries, Ireland). like tale fisherman magic fish; content have, ask much, otherwise lose all.

Yeah wondered seems obvious. top people dgaf many experienced healthcare workers pass away gaining many new inexperienced healthcare workers, people still dealing residual illness catching first wave, many people lost job significant income. thought year bad, think next year bad worst nothing significant changes. facts. bet hang aound conspiracy.sites lot. might get downvoted this, you’re upset wrong thing. Keeping things open deadly disease surging won’t save businesses. Service industries fucked, lockdown lockdown. need federal aid, people moving around maskless indoors.

Get pissed Senators refuse consider passing sort relief. Don’t rail people say “locking pandemic surge good decision.” Like miracle went away /s going Monday. 2nd November.
According Welt. multiple vaccines stage 3 trials now. going available. Make personal. Create PSAs people telling stories losing family members COVID. said claims Sweden less spike countries less immunity. capacity could reached end year

Well sounds like still get good Thanksgiving Christmas parties then. anyone try outlaw certain pronouns? Downvote stupid. hard understand? virus care lock not, daily number cases actually many European countries experienced lull seen US Mainly US least countries like France Germany national lockdown. see US again. right worse last time time US, spreading parts country, eastern states. schools opened, holidays coming up, election day, courts allowing governors impose State Emergency.. stay home, need inside. sister getting tested today extremely squeamish beyond nervous nasal swab go nose. question is, drive there, would allow nasal swab her? know won’t correctly test determines weather she’ll live grandparents temporarily (our parents currently positive). getting tested tomorrow, I’ve already wiped car Clorox wipes, well masks, sanitizer cup holder. 

I taking precautions need want know guys think CVS okay that. Thanks never available? *worldwide. Many didn’t made law haha. Yes less death, agree. flu, heart disease, car accidents avoided stopping certain actions. live abroad, so, get shit all
I guess think that's point, also think that's, part, initial outbreaks deadly. Lots people, packed inside February going days evenings people could exposed dozens nonsystematic spreaders, late infection, one night. Hi everyone! Hope you’re healthy safe today. Wanted ask anyone knows US isn’t going back lock finding cases March? Goinh war? Talking tough millitary. even accept army? ongoing challenge stay healthy Free dumb! Get outta baseless garbage. I'll stick people actually know research instead reposting tweets cherry picked ""data"" points. Try one actual researchers: first problem passing mandate. second, challenging, enforcing mandate. Bitter stupid people becoming super spreaders stupid party, prolonging pandemic restrictive measures come it? would anyone bitter that?  Oh irony, better report thought police. Can’t anyone go agenda. far know, reinfections also limited individuals initially mild cases, would probably fail stimulate immune system sufficiently. OK that's fine....but still decided go public place like gym. upset people wearing mask gym enforcing strict mask policy comes back fact - upon free - elected put high risk situation.


I understand mad least go nature take psychedelics man banner would better hair President Cotton Candy Combover. please source comment? heard say Sweden starting lower level time compared countries Europe, think ever claimed lower (than what?) general, hoped previously infected people parts country keep transmissions lower (than would without them) there. No. 

We see Germany far handled every aspect covid better ideas, used many US. 

I see evidence supports ideas. 

Some scary ""a depression may around corner"" numbers point ideas far dangerous, seems laughable. getting 1200 / week. multiple vaccines available time technology turns anything usable. hey, maybe something like available it'll dent ""a vaccine end pandemic"" thing people trying push. antibodies necessary prevent additional infections seem break quickly. Meaning, can't treat like chicken pox let people get sick they're immune. anything, belief leads infections think ""I got sick month ago I'm safe see grandma."" People catching provides exactly zero benefits  I've noticed thing. unexpected export oriented countries like Sweden Germany - many more. hand lot Landkreise/Städte fear local economy. GDP whole country directly correlated well-being small companies service industry (haircutters, independent shops, restaurants etc) local places. Volkswagen etc exporting time spring (to China etc) therefore catching GDP loss doesnt mean local economy well. zombie movies right. could contagious MERS people would still refuse wear masks want catch prove tough are. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* definitely highly intelligent. make coronavirus great doesn’t work you? certainly sounds different now. Much hoarse speaks, almost like lifetime smoker. havent seen many people calling attention it, really stood me. I'm pessimistic, stories people still denial wake ICU bout COVID. suppose might outliers vast majority people moved take seriously. hand, there's enough gas lighting Administration people may still say good job, China's fault, etc. That's true heavyweight company like SAP goes shatters investor confidence start collapse dominos. [Here full Coronavirus begins page 16 think?

Maybe I'm skimming see anything claiming ended pandemic, they've done combat (which 500k new cases seems fuck all), still. 

They take credit plenty silly shit though, like first image black hole. Obviously there’s evidence wouldn’t it. 

The virus transmits contacting droplets air inside closed space infected person. people stay home immediate social circle, virus can’t transmit. 

Isn’t basically common sense? course lockdown terrible side effects, ultimately measure last resort. coronavirus never eradicated? replaces flu deadlier disease? Lower what? Yes, please.  think masks stay, much like widespread use masks Asia pandemic Four weeks enough, took Victoria Australia almost four months lockdown six million people peaked 1000 cases day. Link? Alot times, skeptics post graphs recent data incomplete claim decline. Hospitalizations U.S. increasing Remember one party tearing statues trying write figures history? Remener one party wanted make illegal speak mind didn’t fit agenda?

The ignorance astounding. Mate literally idea talking about. also managed address nothing said repeated yourself. another untrained ignorant probably fat fool. Enjoy lockdown Trump lmao, deserve him. also technically survive car accident, mean im going go around trying get one. Isn’t real reason China surrounding countries able control virus?

People countries willing accept ankle bracelets, mandatory quarantine government facilities, harsh restrictions personal movement went beyond business closures stay-at-home “orders” really like suggestions.

Westerners culturally don’t accept placed house arrest without due process. instinctively try find loopholes rules, means pretending they’re going grocery shopping really sneaking parents’ house see grandkids. better system prepare this. even necessarily need hardcore doctors staff basic shit. would way cheaper shutting everything long term. BW Herbstferien - started 26.10 ends 30.10. good ended pandemic yesterday. utter shock. talks ""lockdown light""?! 

ok lockdown now, what? Reopen December, peak winter? virus resurge instantly hit peak holidays. then, another confinement come January lead second Bastille. pregnancy put healthcare workers everyone around risk dying getting sick? touch face get pregnant? wondering. School re-opened, workplaces restarted, public transportation satured. sacrificed months lives quarantine so, cases dropped, wanted everything back. gamble... lost. ? Firstly, article actually state 100% officially confirmed, correct?

Secondly, 4 weeks enough time. slows rate active infections. Let know fuck think keep samples unless I'm totally missing something Cool. care either :) Thanks info. smart system Already Covid. Like vast majority people get it, nothing. I'm one rare reinfections care. people know someone resistance we'll restrictions. Nearly everybody know Covid reason they're hurting lockdown. anything protects everyone's right healthy (Recht auf körperliche Unversehrtheit). suggesting done before, even challenged still happen. Don’t know you’re downvoted. unbiased, reasonable sentence whole thread. still holidays coming. We're bumpy ride edge retirement bulk 401k still stocks wrong. Socialism answer. I’m honestly surprised haven’t gotten it. roommates love people over. Granted it’s lot invite sus people sometime counted initially numbers get adjusted maybe week cause death determined. uncommon get news notifications saying something like ""The number deaths Thursday corrected 31 26."" paying people stay home instead

Can read this? Working Sweden never informed benefit relation covid. No, it’s not. matter wanna spin lol. would actually even argue it’s back burner despite large surges. cite peer-reviewed article backup lunacy? don’t assume things little information. cases reinfection. One documented. 2017 Utah, 334 flu deaths. That's whole year. far year, top deaths, Utah seen additional 578 Coronavirus-related deaths.

2018 saw estimated 35k flu deaths nationwide. far Corona killed 200k+ Americans.

Please wear mask, wash hands, remember us give shit. knew going get it. stayed bedroom two weeks rest house would wear mask anytime took food anything. second negative test week later, able go back work

Edit: add that. I’m denier all. wear mask everything part. Didn’t want come across wrong way. Yeah, no. absolutely automated system texts someone saying results available, call back # visit website see results (after entering personal info verify identity). That's local testing site it. Based widespread mask skepticism/conspiracies, doubt vaccine end US. 



Herd immunity comes +/-2 million deaths infections iirc. Never acceptable.  think cases going go winter arrives people going start getting flu. S&amp;P NASDAQ still positive compared January 1. What's infuriating much avoidable. spread happening less dense parts country. Arguably even accidental transmission intentional transmission sake making weird political point.

Mathematically even make much sense spread less dense areas anywhere near reasonable mask usage. Less populated areas huge advantage virus.

This virus dumb: needs fresh hosts. new hosts available burns out. Less virus reduces risk. Masks reduce risk. Hand washing reduces risk. Avoiding density reduces risk.

Add majority US square mile practically immune virus taking really basic steps.

We really country idiots. weep. Although small pilot study, randomized double blind. patients given loarge bolus Calcifidiol (vitamin analogue) went require ICU care rate 2% deaths, given Calcifidiol 50% going ICU care 2 dying. high confidence. mention look observational data, mounting up. Israeli observational study. 52,000 large enough cohort you?

I'm married physician. Let shatter lofty view medical professionals: much like profession, staffed lot mediocre clock punchers. medical profession immune cross section abilities motivations like work places. What's more, due liability issues, want step outside hospital protocol defined lawyers administrators, give best patient care, provide legal protection hospital staff. something change pandemic, NOBODY going go use unless public health officials give ok first provides legal shielding. financial disclosures NIH Covid treatment panel. Currently see 7 50 members disclose ties Gilead Pharmaceuticals, maker Remdesivir. time Remdesivir initially approved use, 9 members disclosed ties. Sorry, Pollyanna, world works people trust financial interests pursue courses contrary best you. Best learn misplace trust again. Want explain CDC told us masks help? Guess, what? interests *your* interests. Think, McFly. think research grants moneys grow trees? make play ball get grants.

These political bodies dictate hospitals physicians pursue far treatment protocols go shields legal liability. NIH recommend broad Vitamin supplementation, many it. trying kill people, many mediocre jobs researching constantly new novel treatment methods, even small percentage actually would this, disincentivized go far outside standard care fear legal liability. 

You ought ashamed thinking simply using brain. Maybe. people healthy, dont know else could done take better care themselves. took sick leave soon didnt feel right helped spreading workplaces. article mention US, mentions Swiss cases. Even give shit. bet pro-lifers already sacrificed Mom/Dad/Grandpa/Grandma reserve god given rights wear mask. probably based models statistical analysis using historical underpinnings. Vaccines may matter much antibodies disappear 4-5 months now. that's assuming 100% effective. Herd immunity requires 95% people immune. media people journalism degrees. would complete understanding epidemiological data changing real-time background matter? Preparations begun one wants major collapse.

Honestly, think people do, way act here. really going for. We've many predictions collapse, even extreme hot spots previous months. But, exceptions, never happened. got dicey New York start Houston little while, that's it. half year hearing hospitals fail people left dying parking lots, I'm going believe see it. 


It supposed happen opened things back up. supposed happen 4th. supposed happen Labor day. supposed happen schools opened up.

It still happened. bad situation, public good eclipses person's personal freedom times like this. infected senior one would suffer caught virus, point would stand. However, untold number infections downstream first infected. almost gotten handle situation sooner, let get bad. go crazy cases US. Insane numbers. 
I looking cases Hungary, 14885 cases reported 7 days, scale size US I'd get almost 505k.

On October 25 3149 new cases, 0.03% overall population, comparison 0.03% US population ~100k.
Sure, population density higher(35 US, 105 us) ~17% us live Budapest. Businesses get 75 % last novembers earnings government assistance. even worrisome edge retirement relying 401k

I say f 401k, bring socialism. time stop feeding war machine take care people. !remindme one week  
“The smallest minority earth individual. deny individual rights cannot claim defenders minorities.” yeah know anyone circles covid

I'm still taking seriously Less 10% population it. overwhelm hospitals millions die unnecessarily can’t get treatment you’re suggesting happens. There’s also guarantee immunity, likely we’ll need yearly shots like flu shot actually control this. everyone get isn’t viable plan way Morocco well  Wow deadly virus isnt going even reach numbers obesity kills year? deadly numbing. 2.8 million year obesity. better stop eating. people 🤦 Lolllllll Thank much jesus christ grim read Wisconsin sucking Trump. Biden double digit lead there. 17 points. Yeah I’ve saying pandemic hasn’t even started yet. Everything far practice run. Get ready winter. us! 👆 one cares People made money could stock market based reality. Many (not all) countries similar experiences. Looks like many parts EU received praise June set worse fall parts US. Keep seeing articles restrictions tho. ""Let's pile Applebee's!!!"" guess Dr. Fauci said still first wave pandemic going get worse gets better suggestion. Lol candy medication worlds apart bruh test, show cases. /s counted 32 people gas stations weekend without masks driving center town. Majority senior citizens. It’s like freaking serious. Florida happening? all? lol can’t find single source that’s case. Anywhere. hospitals experiencing surges aside maybe three hospitals (where restrictions btw) I’m hard time finding evidence this. order magnitude factor ten. definitely correct term taken literally. places also starting ration care based age &amp; preexisting conditions whether think virus hoax you’ve never wear mask socially distanced. That’s reality living now.

If don’t believe virus deadly life important someone who’s cautious be, yet got anyway. Age health zero semblance national contract tracing system place would easy tell idiots denial are.

These anti-maskers denied care; sorry sorry. don’t believe science use medicine. Hospital say “thought prayers” turn away. there's testing??🤔 reality then, too. Still different testing environment. Right, there’s way knowing process here. Wrong. SARS-CoV-1 study talking measured t-cells could recognize virus casing. showed people got SARS 2003 would t-cell reaction COVID-19 virus enters system.

It’s outside scope study determine reaction enough fight infection. 

Again study SAR 2003 COVID 19. didn’t even study helped resist reinfection. I’m PhD scientist I’m ballparking here, I’d say entirely comparable Spanish Flu. Medical advancements technological innovations mean deal much better 1918. I’m sure war also contributed high death toll well. one thing I’ll say it’s somewhat interesting best preventive spreading virus cloth mask actually existed 1918. thought.... love comment.

Not content. incredibly idiotic.

But way pretend care elderly people spouting unverifiable hyperbole pushing misguided personal agenda time masterful.

I see learned lot massive amount time spent conspiracy sub.  become homeless. already happened twice year. Yeah, he’s BIG PHONEY, CHINESE BIG PHONEY. Reddit actually pays yuan. It’s true. can't wrap head around fact Restaurants forced close new security measures children still go school. Buses packed every morning. 

I mean, least send kids 9th grade home splitting remaining students up. way, parents keep working (mostly home) contacts reduced dramatically. Fuck shit! fucking RIGHTS learn mistakes. FUCK LEARNING. Fuck hoax learning shit. /s neighbors open connection (without password) connect also, anything range. might stop it. depends neighborhood. People taken tvs apart remove components related void warranty. pretty hard live unwatched/off grid, especially city. cant even put solar without connecting main grid track much energy youre using (looking growing etc). pretty crazy go rabbit hole believe beginning ... prepare ye buttholes I'm 100% sure remember correctly, Merkel said, support businesses giving 50-75% losses due lockdown. ppl stopped caring

yup everyone numb numbers, theyre big point, every man US 27,335 per million cases Worldometer, Czech Republic 27,276--Czechia reporting much higher per capita numbers US weeks now--Israel number one, Belgium number 2 per capita cases, Czechia third day now, US drops 4th place  Yeahhhh dont know one. say kids can’t free thinkers many children research? seriously doubt went farther parents told them. 

I think terrible idea. UK, desperately wanting visit friends US (I won’t go there’s cure) they’re Republicans keep telling fine election! anecdotes numerous, know takes convince research organization collect firm data quantity jt. frustrating. Yeah, thing people said comparing past 2000's pandemics first wave covid-19, weeks later deaths everywhere Same! flaunt Facebook huge groups non masked get togethers inside huddled up. Ugh huh!

i hear study china said chances getting living inside someone like 16% surprising hey are! takes 2 weeks past infection, 5 days infection get bad enough people seek treatment. lines perfectly schools opening Sept. part plan, hyper capitalists made billions reason leave countries move abroad edited comment include link Great job testing! Keep coming! There's ban tourists since European countries decided open borders back June-July think, Belgium odd one here. situation European countries mask flip flop quite damaging. wasn’t Fauci, generally told stupid panicked wearing masks, 1 month later told stupid selfish wearing one. Regardless correct recommending universal mask usage, damaging reverse direction strongly suddenly. we’re supposed believe science, scientists reverse direction dramatically, undermines rationale trust. arguing gun less effective killing? Scaled US, would like 474000 cases 3357 deaths day. I’d call HR ass. That’s hostile work environment sure. 😕 sad witness. ""United stand"", ""one nation"", thrown shredder.

That's happens begin label disagree politically ""Evil,"" longer room compromise. Hopefully learn stop seeing politicians end-all-be-all remember people power, bunch senile elders willing risk lives keep job.  cases confirmed reinfection sequencing severe illness twice.

Everyone showing immune response, problem immune response entirely response cells dying *appropriate* immune response. There's good chance experiencing least immune dysfunction strongest response, means innate immune system detect virus gets point mass cell die-off. also likely lasting effective response.

This would likely look like typical cold/flu symptoms early on. symptoms, like fever, caused immune response itself. lack symptoms seen people long become contagious pretty solid evidence big part problem virus setting immune systems early alarms viral infection. 

It's also notable since beginning known CT scans many asymptomatic patients never develop obvious symptoms show severe inflammation lungs similar symptomatic patients.

It's simply stimulating immune system, stimulating immune system effective response. Trumps insulin water Good. rate shit burn time [Let Storybots help break  good news....it’s much likely Trump take masks seriously now. Thank much. I'll try that. Well luckily, already pretty full underqualified teachers cant get much worse first aid course instructor told us prevalent waste 80 percent waste workers got covid. Treatment improving. know lot covid now.

We know lot covid now, evidence actually treatment getting worse last month. surveillance testing results UK, instance.

IFR point, however. Deaths direct relation infections based IFR. IFR affect fast deaths rise. thing affecting fast deaths rise fast infections rose ~3 weeks earlier. doctor actually *prescribed* Vitamin D; thinks *that* important. doctors ""idiots"", right? /s saying this. remember meme circulating end 2019, beginning 2020 listed holidays great days fell on. Things like Cinco de mayo taco Tuesday. 4th July Halloween Saturday. others. 

Then covid said ""oh well."" unfortunate, entirely predictable. It’s akin nothing house catches fire surprised burned ground.  Lmao wear mask go life lol

Comment history hell thing. could possibly say someone callous disregard human life? made references drug vaccine, sorry confusion. bad there, first wave now? Maybe constitution needs modernizing. constitution number 5 France need number 6 simply physically happen. misinformed. lockdown divide daily infections factor 10 20 even 50.

What bring us backwards lower point exponential.

Say 2000 cases day snowballs 100K cases 3 months later, hard lockdown 6 weeks get back 2000. reopen 2 months later another lockdown 15K/day 1 month lockdown get 500/day. reopen 2 months later 5000/day. Lockdown 100 3 4 months reprieve.

That's seesaw better fast burning. I'm real Catch-22.

I want move America partly response Covid-19 can't move America response Covid-19. 🥳🥳 seems like biggest fail humanity ever, given knowledge capabilities year 2020.....  Amen. Sorry you’re enduring similar. Definitely 100%. Super important definitely possible shopping transmit disease, known major route. long mall crowded, wear mask keep distance groups likely fine. May opening schools bad idea, huh? would logical. work lab, us ""Winter testing season"" begins beginning October. us means 2 things - Norovirus Influenza.

This year obviously different, people turning A&amp;E (UK equivalent ER) respiratory symptoms, first worry Covid. Even current spike, 2 weeks October already significantly busier normal - going critical within another 2 weeks. didn’t like last lockdown since shut college honest don’t want another lockdown. really want see mask mandate gets enforced, bs it’s states. 

My states governor spineless piece trash left city government mandate masks zip codes. yeah want mask mandate something complete shutdown, maybe restricting indoor dining bars big issue state.  Spanish flu lasted years, 8 month mark. 
 
We also benefit looking past data worry countries manipulating data. 
 
Personally dont think death count accurate all. Orange One

Mandarin confirmed /s Two doses often needed Yeah, powerlifting mask struggle however subsided weeks working out. take things slow! Yes.

The laws vary province ...

In Ontario, '[Healthcare Consent minimum age giving healthcare consent. Age really considered denying healthcare (age 16).

Also keep mind Canada socialized healthcare, really easy get vaccination, direct cost. never choice economy lives, rich

Uh no. actually sounds like something rich person would say. actually lower half income concerned economy. hope valuable trade skill, difficult immigrate US Conservatives sure love magical thinking. don’t talk virus even exist? think happy positive thoughts “give fear” magically go away. Yikes edited titles. “Equal 327,000 US cases” mean? know necessary, lot people give fuck, people whose livelihood threatened example. feel sympathy them? successful want successful. Yes, fire thousands federal workers, *will* enough. despite brilliant plan, called Trump ""crazy"".Oh, yeah-- crazy like fox. /s Nah tho  maskholes give kinds rationalization based ""research,"" basically want something help protect someone else. me. Thankfully get medically, that’d fun able grow don’t lick doorknobs inhale someone’s sneeze. Glad see take procautionary measures. Tell ""for greater good"" like Canada did. Yes know husband started drinking again, last night beat two children, can't afford groceries anymore, greater good! \\s feels bit think virus ""eating"" people. Actually eat all. goes cells replicate explode them

So like insemination rather eating you. Maybe bit like alien chestbuster Half co-workers strongly believe Covid go away election 

That's skewing people think. think ""the useless security theater measures disappear election day"" disease precautions going away. 4,000 cases 21,000,000 people.

Of 49,000 people Florida currently hospitalized something, 2,300 hospitalizations due COVID (that's less 5%.) would take daily cases increasing around 25,000/day translate enough hospitalizations put healthcare system capacity. worst, FL reached \~10k positives/day couple weeks July

The reason full lockdown strategy ""flatten curve"" overwhelm health system still trying operate normally. people call greed profits FL huge service economy people eat. Given 5% health system dedicated towards treating COVID factor beds, ICU beds ventilators, FL good bad number.  logic sound diabetic person saying, ""They coming cure diabetes next month eat sugar want right take anymore medicine."" Bringing back manufacturing still good idea, even half population unemployed. ok, Spanish flu, even SARS. 30 years old dying streets, people would social distance.

COVID-19 dangerous virus also largely harmful majority population, people really fear themselves. world gone long without World War, people bored want start shit reason feel superior other. need something fight for, even stupid belief Covid-19 hoax wearing mask end life. it'll disappear! make infection far worse. Treatment improving. know lot covid now. Steroids advised first wave...now, doctors wait put people vent last ditch attempt save them. getting better treating curing it. borders aren’t Europe Australia. 355000 people commute everyday France Belgium, tens thousands Belgium NL, NL Germany, Germany Denmark, Denmark Sweden etc etc. Basically way Portugal west Russia east, millions people would unable go work hard borders implemented. 

On top that, many people healthcare workers, without many hospitals receiving countries wouldn’t able operate. ""good news""? Yes, cases, deaths. Fauci says mom packs best lunches school!!! die Covid later 30 days? die Covid without positively tested? mean like phone camera microphone gps tracking? alexa/google home system, blink/ring security cameras, ever growing number integrated cloud aware sensor networks exist vehicles, stations, roadside stands, stoplights, airports, towers, more? Americans fucking stupid. Economies recover, dead don't.  Thank posting that.
Fearmongering media cool :( &amp; many people 300lbs +? Would nice know many are, guess ""future work"". You’re suppose try get infected, screen folks try include greater risk infected. Curb enthusiasm: 
""However, know ever vaccine all. important guard complacency over-optimism. first generation vaccines likely imperfect, prepared might prevent infection rather reduce symptoms, and, even then, might work everyone long."" Omg. province 200 yesterday share border muricans. wonder start believing it’s real now. Canadian - legalization come better time. first crop well, second one (this year) gave us quite bit. Wut? around like 120k? Averaging 1k deaths day 65ish days left deaths would really increase. wait 2 weeks week 15 positive rate 18.81% 19,880 tests performed ""hospital/senior care staff, critically ill risk groups "".  category people could tested greatly expanded.  week 42 positive rate 3.79% 136,598 tests performed ""everyone slightest symptoms, young old, critical ill 'just sneezing bit lately'"".  week 42 6.87 times tests performed, positive rate 5 times lower.  seems me, greater numbers purely result testing categories people, positive rate decreased greater rate number tests increased.

Why would think so, though? would decrease positivity rate proportional increase tests? can't know without analyzing lot data. 

It seems plausible circumstances, increase tests greater decrease positivity rate.

If Sweden tested twice week 15, would positivity fallen 9,9%? regression seems fast me. Ad hominem right, last time looked Socialstyrelsens number slightly smaller, came corrections. different criteria. statistics raison d'être. would socialism. can't global pandemic, siree bob want none socialism, people need pull bootstraps... somehow.

That's literally right wing mentality. face pandemic that's far deadly flu people supposed put risk ensure top 1% ""undue"" burdens put upon rest us.

Fuck GOP fuck everyone votes assholes. people getting virus left gasping air streets. argument there. hide long, like country. wanted clarify thinks China hiding deaths time. I'd argue opposite. experience, **regular people** (as opposed mathematicians epidemiologists) work actual numbers much readily rates.

If ask someone ""how bad 350,000 people getting diagnosed COVID every day"" likely get entirely different answer ask ""how bad 107 people per 100,000 getting diagnosed COVID every day""? 

The latter makes sound like *not problem all*. Whereas former sounds like much bigger problem. Yeah, learnt live many viruses, dont see ever going away, looks it, vaccine keep going needed year year, lets try manage road-map normality **However, feasible**

Did read whole comment? If, theoretically, something like this, would recommend also obtaining [testing verifying drugs get internet. reddit, country US = good, US = bad country failed people underlying oath. Spain Italy also problems. people still believing hoax called death?  rOunDing cUrVe probably true affordable though. regardless vaccines afterwards?  Wow, live literally ten minutes road place. surreal happens close. I've noticed anything Sweden, there's group people rush defend Sweden's policies much like Trumpsters defend policies. think it’s latter Yes know. 

Why telling that, nowhere? course.

Right America longer protecting freedoms.

Being critical fine, can’t go thinking China Russia would better guiding powers, it’s going happen.

America flaws. it’s far best three. [Daily new confirmed cases per million serious? think smart phones are?

sorry english Halloween Saturday, I’ll say following Wednesday rise cases. retrospective study came saying 80% people hospital Covid deficient Vitamin D!!

That true.

The problem is, people stupid understand basic stuff, also stupid understand Vitamin stuff - also think Bill Gates invented vitamin brain poison. Germany &lt;20% US deaths per capita. saw didn’t see blaming democrats. disbelief saying side would never that’s bad side bad stuff. definitely leopards ate face moment. anyone find WH claimed this? read referenced presser can't find anything. stem cells could literally grow brand new pair lungs applied. Since that’s embryo cells womb— grow body parts form human. They’re found embryos, can’t them. (But Trump can).

**Massive** oversimplification stem cells. 

Also incorrect many points. It’s season, -10° C (or F) temperature. I’m extremely disappointed local police decided won’t enforce mask bylaw. Makes entirely toothless, makes people resent law enforcement more. job. mean Stalinist Russia, fucking goon? 😂😂😂 Oh man one cracked up. share mods including verified specialist could laugh. Thanks making morning hahaha. believes is, matters.

Nobody cares buddy anyone dumb enough need it.

Unfortunately us needed many literally conservative ideology USA. I'm Berlin makes people blow overwhelming majority get + clear without symptoms. 

Well know since January. That's works. 

Then explained 10.000 times people big problem anyway. OVERWHELMS HOSPITALS. KNOW BAD, SOMEBODY EXPLAIN HOSPITAL IS.

Getting spend every day made happier I've life TWIV... use abbreviations assume everyone knows referring to? Yes, weekly average 60.000 tests.

However, testing strategy changed last week. Before, everyone came contact tested positive tested too. backlog outgrow laboratories processing capacity, changed testing people show symptoms.

Recall precision different was. 25% positive tests disregards asymptomatic carriers. So, number could straight extrapolate entire general population anymore. talking about? “cloth fabric”? 68 year old diabetic mom (who also COPD lupus) still invites people apartment. ridiculous tears apart. annoyed leave suite, since class 3:40 probably safer use daily providone-iodine solution. much iodine wreck thyroid. rich kid dilema always gonna unfair good point opinion.

Hugging doesn’t spread it, stop fear mongering. says working ending pandemic. click bait article title. like saying lost weight diet.  lived Nice. cities south sea really nice, think. Much better Paris. “This” actually cost shutdowns everyone talking about. What? read? kind performance art piece? see rejection evidence happening real time. Fascinating. Right, umm, might coherent enough type election night, voted month ago via mail I'm waiting everyone else point. Why? number reinfections low. quarantine 14 days I’ll free go travel stuff again. 23, 1870 cases. Go bitcoin ATM. thing pretty much happened me. got tested results came back ""indeterminate."" Freaked sure, got retested next day came back negative. Fuck off. 

RIP remaining French economy. Hope liked saving granny This. There's people northeast saving 5, 10 years whose jobs affected pandemic. everything's least 25%-50% higher pre-pandemic outside NYC proper. Doubly true West Coast Cali.

I imagine people getting antsy waiting foreclosures stop held up. believe read somewhere Wisconsin country would highest infection rate world.  Winning  Florida trying contaminate one at-risk populations *other* highly at-risk population.

I guess Florida's gonna Florida day long. America #1 wrong reasons. Yes do, far know respond anyone want? pressed well mandatory lock 2-3 weeks even grocery stores

ration supplies food water last month despite 2 week lockdown ( people stop first week month anyway)

give people needed meds keep lines open incase medical problems etc

assuming take 1 week prepare middle december free again

honestly tho might late plan tossing away food spoiled food stockpiles shorten might enough lock large population 2weeks

we might missed chance (my store shelves missing sooooooo much usually stuff) money Friday Likely due low population density, California strictest restrictions daily cases higher Florida recent weeks, higher deaths well. Florida close restriction, better economy recovery, residents happier well make choice live life, masks delays inevitable populated areas fall ...like west saved Hong kong? replying yo-yo. know reddit works? google government Amazonas confirmed occupancy beds Hospital Delphina Aziz, reference state care patients Covid-19, reached 94% last weekend. confirmation made press conference Tuesday morning (27/10), measures announced try solve problem. interview, alarming fact: 60% patients currently hospital's ICU patients sequelae assistant executive secretary Urgency Emergency Care, Moab Amorim, Manaus, 3% 4% infected new coronavirus type sequel. “The main sequelae today kidney failure, acute chronic, permanent lung injuries, levels and, cases, patients begin develop chronic hypertension”, warns.

The long-term morbidity survivors suffer concerning. Amazonas already manifesting critical public health burden. US states...

Why would matter land air borders largely closed? cohesive *nationwide* plan US lacked. think Hong Kong added Australia China relations gone well lately. know Vietnam talked sure maths work. Fatality rate US due covid 2.6% now, tat's definitely far higher thn proclaimed '0.01% risk'. exponential rise cases, healthcare facilities overwhelmed see rise fatality rate. Keeping calm good, oblivious doesnt. Oh come now. sports, mean can't call proper name. mean, seriously. Coming goofy expressions everyone's favorite national pastime, Cricket, juvenile. That's rough. wonder mostly older teachers left. could big brain drain, experienced teachers serve invaluable mentors. heard guys already ended pandemic. unwell. Seek help. lots documented evidence goes stories press protestors push. matter. Facts racist nowadays. I’m going CDC data personally wouldn’t problem comes question, clear? know that’s couple years line. People won’t comply long vaccinated. I’m realistic.

And talk sacrifices needing made save vulnerable. concern vulnerable people diseases viruses before? didn’t harsh measures save them? People want act like death isn’t part life going save every single person won’t. Even vaccine, masks, social distancing, people still die virus. add Singapore, Vietnam Hong Kong list too. zero - single digit community cases. 99% mask compliance springs experience, 99.9% Denver metro mean, aren’t prioritizing health. You’re prioritizing health too, especially older. weird. test pointless results can't known game Colorado waits 24 hours report number, yesterday big winter storm closed lot test centers, tests cases down, positivity rate same.  need see # deaths caused flu days precious years. Near zero. Man, that's lot crisis actors. /s ""Okay, Mr. Cricket,"" said Ant. true all. Hospitalizations US again. can’t even believe people manage think otherwise. Please explain chart suggests going down?  Put glorious leader may immune. else matters. plan go herd immunity. /s That’s fair consideration too, it’s difference say another 6 weeks would make sense! no, much like knife, stabbed 27 times apparently need single stitch ""Ignorance strength.""
-George Orwell
1984

This strongest sub reddit. Perhaps Republicans refused allow oversight hear 10 new stories day Same. Methotrexate sucks, anything else costs thousands dollars per dose. really understand Canada double death rate per case US. Probably second wave now? sure need go herd immunity conservative court kill Obamacare quickly possible . Priorities. Pandemic less insurance herd immunity. /s Ahh got ya.

Edit pissy defensive comment NYC vs Chi town za. I’m illusions man. Instead wanted supporters shoot dead government officials trying enforce lockdowns jackshit vaccine. I’m still leaning towards Duterte moment. Update: Turner came back onto field game take pictures celebrate teammates. proposed solution what, let police shoot shrug it? Hospitalizations well. Normally I'd agree you, social fabric society literally crumbling. Lockdowns reimposed stimulus coming. I'd rather vaccine riots streets. Ratio hospitalized patients deaths much higher IFR.

And saw plenty videos Italy Spain peaks containment, going defeat it. Trump plan defeat. That's absolutely ridiculous statement work healthcare know better.

We know lot virus since beginning year, info

For 99.99% population minimal risk. deadly thought. Stop unnecessary fear mongering   vastly underestimating many people still wear seatbelts  take several months... pity wife can't, throw hypomania 😭 1000 pretty high Denmark size population. Vic Australia similar size population peaked around 700 day going harsh 100 day lockdown get back control. could leave house essential work, food, medical 1hr outdoor exercise within 5km residential die catch cold flu. already good treatment flu called Tamiflu.  I’m getting r/conspiracy discussion 9-day old account. Nope. Nah that's many people deal with. It’s going rate that’s enabling active hospitalizations decrease problem. Good wearing mask. Many human rights individual rights. Restricting majority decisions still problematic.

And lockdowns, someone picks winners losers. At-risk folks, like elderly sick, win. Kids can't go school play friends, lose. Imagine getting call dad telling masks scientifically proven work. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Good news, people demographic posting Reddit would last people even access vaccine anyway. Every 9 months? confused correlation wearing mask co-op providing supplies. Yeah agree mean first read 50% effectiveness let phase 3 trials read out, otherwise we’ll stuck transmission overall likelihood think got real deal. I'm 11 days shot one, pretty tired 12 hours followed massive amount sinus blockage kicked days 5-7 vanished quickly came. might get antigen test day 28, impossible specify whether getting one tests N protein parts, probably wait things get unblinded. Donald orange fucking Trump said Corona's over, done wins says, good fucking Lord we're screwed!!!! Unfortunately nature science, especially confronting new entity like COVID. Goalposts change, it’s arbitrary. Frustration led Trump disregard safety measures spread COVID across country. upset Fauci CDC first said masks weren’t needed, changed course said were. could conceive rules could change considers “fake.” lacks understanding scientific process. saying that’s it’s not, it’s extreme example frustration comes inconsistent messaging. don’t think there’s way avoid circumstance.

It huge sacrifice doubt, especially least likely suffer worst outcomes COVID expected follow rules. saving lives. noble, sucks. That’s advocate opening fun non-essential stuff ASAP vaccine young people (and elderly/sick choose) start live again. boring places everyone go need remain safe get clear IMO. It’s okay endanger vulnerable people places need be.  No, referring joke made Jon Stewart feels New York pizza better Chicago pizza said Chicagoans swim pizza avoid winter. think part apocalyptic people argue it. 

Imagine major city wiped map bet ppl would wear masks then. True. time half million new cases week. bit like arguing brand fire extinguisher want use house fire. can't let perfect enemy good. They're not. see tons kids sent home school symptoms possible exposure every day. Hush, say things like here! TBF matter crisis would drag on. Even countries strict restrictions going second wave. better country likelihood. district offered 3 options, 3rd party virtual, 6 hr zoom class virtual full time person. 80% parents chose full time person. 80%. We're hot zone we're small state 2,000 hospital beds entire state. class sizes literally larger March (18-23 per class) since many parents chose option teachers coming back. 3 ft distancing acceptable infected teacher showing symptoms quarantine. Cleaning discussed, teachers freaking crying board meetings...it's awful. [El Paso County bringing mobile morgues virus death toll I’m sorry hear that. tea? seems need read that.

I would say deaths 'very low' compared March. See 'Daily New Deaths United States' 'near-zero-flu-death' valley means literally near zero death. Awful decision. don’t get it. Covid honestly dangerous scale viral threats. know that’s like blasphemy it’s true amount mental gymnastics change data. american city? lol I've drinking green tea along. Iwork C19 testing facility. small interactions possible positive patients day long. far good. Also taking vitamin D, C, etc. yeah ""any"" got covid project machines Part believes sarcastic response anti-maskers. 
And part wonders someone neat writing can't take extra effort spell correctly. 
Very confusing levels. read ""UNO harbenger doom."" 232,084 now...  follow mean enforce anything? probably get sick wear mask, social distance, live building 10,000 people trapped inside me. Duterte guy wanted “shoot dead” people violated lockdown Starting? shit hit fan long time ago Harder Hulk punch something oblivion! Offer monthly stimulus free supply masks

Sounds like decent policy. could also throw decent policy ideas own. 

Doesn't matter, nothing going happen national level January, Biden wins democrats take Senate.

We're going see infection rate skyrocket holidays, absolutely guarantee republicans going jack shit lame duck session except try distance Trump start bitching national debt again. can’t catch either yeah US way, money printer goes brrr. cant go wrong right open business vote Republican? Socialstyrelsen counts 1% deaths FHM. Surely much difference, completely different methods counting used? America big, many cultural disparities. could quote every grest empire history fell due overexpansion, think terms name USA: *United States America*. Every state seperate entity, libked together (this I'm struggling grasp, idk means American anymore, idea centralised American culture fading passing day) Foolishness tied heart boy (youth). lack experience life prone make rash decisions result. polls, Fat boy struggling get lead Texas fucking places. may still get narrow victory, still, Texas confirmed victory telling chances next week. 


Have guys considered polls media wrong lying? 

Of course not, thatd require critical thinking.  need another full lockdown want see cases go down. everyone sub fatigued covid already? seems like everyone comments downvoting anything less pollyanna perspective Within week Belgium might highest deaths per capita. agree mostly everything said deaths anywhere near population california. That's 40 million. deaths definitely hit low millions 40? chance. Highly doubt even counting properly. Lmaooo He'll both, whine election fraud making country suffer  Badgers :( kind weird response that? think care accuracy truth, whether scares people makes feel good? fair, think ever actually finished building wall. made-up thing. true, everyone done point scary words effective anymore Half country already acting like covid gone people still need wear fucking mask. every fucking country hold covid mask mandates contact tracing. one acting like child, whining people bending knee want needing basic human interaction. 21st century entertainment technology substitute social interaction shouldn’t treated such.  North Dakota 4th lowest population density state. quite achievement bad covid response. starting look pretty bad, think Sweden hit peak 50-60 deaths per day winter. Lol, increasing spread virus knocks people feet weeks puts hospital community great way drum business. friend got rona didn’t go single restaurant *and* lost three weeks pay! Republican economics action. \*6. can't spread fear life never go back normal long term immunity Wow, often see level tolerance rational discussion occur online. tip hat good sir / madam. gold! I'm saying wrong here, say ""no idea"" wants happen ridiculous. least *understand* disagreeing. love get high media outrage cycle. turn shit pretty normal there. 


This ain't exactly black plague. Netherlands kind issue, healthcare workers getting infected, allowed stay home show symptoms even positive (as far know hospital work), course measurements taken you’re positive. instance one nurse positively tested still come work, however put separate office administrative tasks minimize contact Jan. 21 12:01pm becomes President Biden's fault. Lol like 8 degrees Celsius nights here, 46 Fahrenheit. 

It’s cold us okay haha Remindme! 1 January husband want leave state, let alone country. trying make best can.


 hard. Yeah, realize likely happen. also much complex simply crossing border. reasonably well educated. bachelor's business administration. suppose probably talking master's higher.

I suppose wishful thinking. Escapism see storm coming want nothing with. prize examples the... people say, ""Just leave country!"" easy. were, would left long ago. calculations, 10% closer 14% 20-25% you’re guessing, yet said unlikely. Hmm, smells like bs me. yet lockdown many isn’t even bad days. technology home delivery’s it’s bad. Obviously worse like back day. People really selfish pandemic shown us much. market fluctuates down.

When look investments: ""fluct again."" offered free weekly testing state health department company said want deal open shifts nurses quarantining vaccine coming play affect May trajectory? always like sadly... People think smallest scale without ever looking web logistics surrounding one node reality resources reallocated get infected hopefully (because love humans) recover. take days exposure testing positive. Looking White House Rose Garden party, people test positive 5 days Trump did. Offer monthly stimulus free supply masks exchange mask distancing pledge, stop monthly payments they're reported vagrant masklessness intentionally breaking pledge.

It's sad, either bribe scare signidicant part population convince care others themselves..and even justify previous stance selfishness, likely blaming someone.

Who knew 1/3+ us cartoon villains? People actively choosing causing/experiencing possible death suffering possibly laughed ridiculed actual idiots. things never considered equally. fuck can't take tiniest bit stupid ridicule possible cost hurting someone, anyone? ultimate selfishness. far know yes. focused leisure activitys. mostly said things closed. soft approach. Restaurants bars (when understand) main concern wear mask eat. Many, many things would also make sense approach get back control. Let wait see happen. think still get worse hey maybe gets less worse. see happens. Wth talking about? protests lack funds businesses would shut proposed lockdown. apply foreign dynamics another country. Exactly. deciding better keep spreading disease follow basic health guidelines. elders paying price. implement strong mandates

In July Wisconsin sheriffs say enforce mask orders. think would enforced now?  desensitized everything? difficult early running around ramped one knew was. 

what say outdoor trucks bodies them? Maybe. know one idiot thinks whole thing fake. 

I think want everything make happen quickly possible. 

And isolated &amp; pretty spread Andorra #1 world, west. know people checked parents taken home covid, open whole nother worms. anyone thinks covid improve right election won't. Almost inevitable it'll get worse. We've entered winter, R number 1 thr US already seeing rise cases inevitably deaths soon rise account lag cases deaths Sadly.  Canadians stop using USA measuring stick dealing COVID. clearly mismanaged/fumbled handling saying “well better them” ridiculous. 

Our numbers worst yet entire pandemic hospitals starting get maxed out. (really every country) fighting example lead come this, comparing countries failing. 

Also get it, people tired covid doesn’t mean going go away. Everyone got get mindset long fight, hopefully vaccine treatment available summer 2021. fear time next year going spot won’t summer/fall 2022 things get back “normal” logic seems would go ways. people expect Americans fall line new President? guess that’s risk take open business elect Republicans. past decade, number tents near closest freeway on-ramp gone one dozen. seems pretty consistent whole urban corridor. sound like ""pretty fine"" correct way forward depends myriad factors really (And comes crazy family’s prepper upbringing take controversial takes pinch salt) go ahead give basics. 

-Food Water: you’re number one priority times, especially crisis. Canned food, non-perishable goods, vacuum sealed foods, etc absolutely perfect weathering difficult times would suggest amass surplus items, truth told you’re probably gonna want least weeks worth food per person household. doesn’t mean completely skip perishable items tho. You’re gonna want keep pretty balanced diet long help keep body best shape can. Generic multivitamins also help starve nutrient deficiencies means sure guarantee. It’s also good idea stock bottled water. go three days without clean drinking water that’s game over. Worse comes worse you’ll thankful it.

-Shelter: best advice always shelter place/nearby long remains safe. regards Covid would highly suggest limiting exposure Indoor public places much possible Christ sake wear mask go out. 

-Supplies protection: vary heavily depending I’d say bear essentials you’ll always need ( least somewhere house) follows

Flashlight (rechargeable someway bonus Required, battery powered fine make sure pack more)

A portable radio (see flashlight. information anything) 

A good multipurpose knife ( even it’s pocket knife you’ll thankful it)

At least two changes clothes

A sturdy backpack

Matches fire starting device

A portable medical kit ( even it’s store bought) 

And worst case scenario something defend yourself. ( truth told don’t think current circumstances going lead outcome, however better safe sorry. don’t gun, neighbor? family feed? think could take landlord fight? questions you’re going ask things really go rails. experience it’s better feel paranoid play versus blindsided worst possible time) 

This glazing quite 
Factors vary person person (medications, governmental restrictions, location specific laws, financial situations, etc) Overall you’ve least covered contemplated bases personally guarantee you’re better probably 40% people. printing it, borrowing it. presumably burning 220 billion € year. gdp 3.9 trillion debt 1.9 trillion spend around another 1.8 trillion. great, could worse. flairs though? Nope. assholes know exactly doing, refuse. familiar type.

They care. Can't scapegoat politicians. We're still figuring exact numbers, source estimates 10%: claims 40% people experienced previous SARs outbreaks experience long term chronic fatigue. Vaccine may come year, unified platform get everyone vaccinated, 6000 insurance companies USA, coordinating them, person gets vaccine bill insurance company, bill government take time. many vaccines cross linking issues people might need disclose preexisting conditions, might increase rates change coverage criteria, kicking changing plans might delay. US health care past years policies decisions, made explicitly goal government able create centralized health care platform, basically coralling, 6000 companies devise logistic system vaccinate everyone time without vaccinating anyone twice. insurance state wide, like insurance covers Louisiana, new york may able get vaccine true millions students workers. in......Tell us something know.

There's large segment population, lead President, pretending *not* know. love another issue whine Republicans lmao. Well 40% Americans don’t know think Nah he'll claim election fraud condolences.  destination abundant sorrow pain. No, I'm saying worried lot fatality rate covid. Scar tissue lungs one many things.  also pink eye vp debates. symptom iirc it. sister Destin last weekend. said one wearing mask there. think people better southern Fl.  Yeah, think US basically finished. wish cld discuss separating country instead future civil war It’s alright. assume lot people don’t really general idea stressful first responder fire department major city like. Especially pandemic, high unemployment rates high murder rates one year. followed guidelines T. Social distance, mask extra filters, hand sanitizing regular mention knee deep thus even knew going on. 

Therapy take far seeing gym friends I’ve known since 16 welcome sight. checking knew bad west side south side gotten. I’m looking sympathy goddamn it’s hard ass month. Austin, facebook feed full people asking plans... nonetheless people posting selfies bars enclosed space/doing activity according *science* covid safe. literally whatever get away regardless actual science is. gonna pandemic *doesn’t* actually end November 4 it’s hoax? Less 10% population it.

That's unlikely. multiplier CDC using summer 10x, meaning 10 times many infections detected. Even halve that, would put US 45M infections, 14%. likely closer 20-25%. Pump bleed baby. certainly want give anything bordering medical advice tell this. people sensitive stomachs vitamins general cause upset, little poking around curiosity apparently cases excess vitamin intake way vitamin interacts calcium levels cause stomach pain. 

Given idea much vitamin getting sunlight fortified foods, there's really way give good advice one way except suggest going supplement vitamin probably get blood serum test check levels talk doctor it. went bar watched game last week. house arrest? Alright, thanks help! hardest hit countries right resorted strategy, testing sick people; see Czechia, Poland Belgium example hanging 30 %. Apparently Reddit community people suffering like this:

r/covidlonghaulers masks might required lot places end 2021

Like what? Hospitals airports? grocery probably see lot (much-needed) collective actions combat climate change social injustice

Like what? reason would go away get worse unless people disciplined mask wearing contact. virus get ""tired shit"" like people do. short attention spans going cost thousands thousands lives. Realistically close Vaccine? understand distribution administering vaccine entire population takes time hearing vaccine year ends. , boils soon administer vaccine. ""Don't pay attention""

Sounds right ND/SD intelligence levels know, like early 1930s Germany, they're alright today.

You consider whole, ""murder factory"" deal. totally concentration camps refugee seekers already, history tells us happens camps fill up. 90 years ago, history written victor, would burn piece literature didnt agree version truth. Today, republican figurehead trying convince us news wrong science isnt real, dumb realize internet loves, also allows history saved something isnt tangible.

Tldr: hitler could gotten away succeeded, burning newspapers books. Trump cant burn internet. -- US companies manufacture N95 allowed continue taking foreign orders. countries completely ""knocked park"" terms amazing COVID response: Taiwan, South Korea, countries banned mask export ramped high quality mask production. Here, still enough N95 even hospitals, tell regular people go around basically wearing bandanas (maybe 25-50% effective, vs 70%+ effective surgical mask, 99%+ effective N95 KN95, 98-99% effective KF-94). rebuild broken economy, can't bring back dead.... yet, 2020 yet. really, wouldve game tomorrow Dodger lost tests today would useful screen game. Likewise tests yesterday used today's game. could easily say positive test came ""early"" opposed ""late"". take lot tests report results soon available. Pffft, trillion $ so. problem! live here. live *this*. brain dead. less hopeful I. don’t think take years exactly reasons articulated. People won’t tolerate it, policymakers scientists know that. know fatigue devastation wrought.

COVID exceptionally bad discussed endlessly media, far deadlier flu. effects aren’t well known. causing neuro rheumatological conditions patients. It’s nuts. least flu vaccine, care washing hands getting vaccine. it’s deadly. COVID like someday, probably endemic much lower body count

Maybe special store/facility hours people need distance mask, like businesses designated hours senior citizens right now? might work. won’t perfect however goes. agree, need regain degree normalcy ASAP. must way protect old/sick, least awhile see things pan give virus chance attenuate. get back that, im guessing mainstream media hype nothing usual.

But also know Trump sanctioned German companies building gas pipelines Russia Germany? kind putin agent this? think little ridiculous shit Saudi arabia gets little attention stuff Russia questionable. But... but... I'm MORALLY SUPERIOR people...""tHe ScIeNcE"" said so... 😭 always trust holy priests ""sCiEnCe""! ...I mean, long confirm beliefs clickbait title feels good, course. scientific method, what's that? That's true, know someone saw positive results web first get call. Honestly, call anyway - I've tested four times now, every negative test eventually followed cheerful person reminding still want going anywhere. 

But cases am, presume time that. assume time literally call army make phone calls, website still somewhere list options. ask me. care. US citizen. tons analysis coronavirus deaths, mortality rates, excessive deaths due covid-19. digestive system diseases celiac, Chrone’s, etc. also susceptible low levels. Well season get better, lucky  China never claimed ""winner"". People usually get infected attending private gatherings, public biggest problem hospitals regions absolutely prepared deal like ones populated areas. ""Getting hit hard"" rural areas going look lot different. keep reading abnormal levels ferritin research involvement transferrin COVID-19. wonder caused mechanism hair loss experienced iron deficiency. moderator actually ""verified specialist"" whereas aren't. get it, think know everything cruise Wikipedia, stop pretending expert obviously aren't. like guy took Psych 101 class thinks they're qualified shrink. abbreviations four common cold coronaviruses. shown bar chart. line flu. I'd happy return favor. Girls... Ready? would dope, there's like 5,000 airports U.S. already nightmare screen people TSA, imagine trying add COVID-sniffing dogs mix?

All significant portion population idiots think whole thing hoax. crickets sound lovely evening. Respect Almost reminds Salem, halloween. Crowded streets sidewalks packed month. cases rising sharply MA, hope things go better Itaewon Salem starting show. dangerous average, *on individual level*. Regardless, capability quickly overwhelm hospitals, danger that, that's increasing restrictions justified.

Not saying that's necessarily what's happening Chicago, time place everything. hospitalizations surging across US, see restrictions implemented. Whether justified moment time debatable.  Left ""stupid"" list  cannot double forever test capacity limited. Like air curtains doors! Someone thinking outside box! CFR. argument kills mostly elderly anything virus dangerous not, still kills. well, kills idiots im it. Yup, long DeSantis follows Trump around. in, water wet. chart shows hospitalizations week 42 (most recent quick search ""Trump signs refuses enforce sanctions Russia"" find tons articles subject mainstream news sources. DiBlasio idiot. fix New York, that's job. 

He's stupid anything shoot mouth. New York survive him. Money election hardly major factor situation since there's expensive effective resources nobody ever voted based scientific literacy candidates. Like west made sure SAR saved Taiwan.

Great China cracking citizens somehow America’s fault. That's pretty much it, think. deaths good part cases earlier part pandemic, 75% deaths 50% cases June, death rate per case looks like see New York Italy nobody knew anything could help back then. US 20% cases time frame, they've accumulated lot cases time treatment survival rates thankfully improving.

Plus, course, situation mentioned Quebec - got directly nursing homes early on, terrible consequences. That's Quebec per case death rate 6%, almost twice rest Canada, upwards 80% deaths came first months pandemic. sucked everyone. even though may seem like dumb talking point now, US really large volume testing now. really plausible Canada IFR 5%, even initial outbreak care homes. Community transmission widespread product skewing high mortality LTC facilities - majority cases diagnosed, *certainly* caught start this. anyone eli5 situation France got way?

Basically, idiot friends aren’t full anti-maskers say it’s settled masks help. They’re saying “look France, guess masks don’t work.” Based quick internet sleuthing appears control virus summer started unravel august. Mask mandates started late august, far tell Paris. sure hard hit regions mitigation steps they’ve taken second wave heats up. I’m guessing answer didn’t mandate masks fast enough, mask fatigue, we’re seeing impact 6-8 weeks later. insights would helpful. doubt god anything it. Bring cot gov California refused allow complete reopening without lowering cases. gyms closed child distance learning since March. aren’t bordered states probably inundated soon island..
but Newsom strict. Disneyland pissed! lot people. aren’t surging yet. People seem think children dont commonly die covid safe. Meanwhile theres hoard 'safe' little monsters running around infecting communities.

(Not necessarily kids fault) weekly monthly statistics. even think need post them?

All know Influenza Coronavirus two completely different types virus. people busses hear, also curious effects areas. Americans already asking Canadian neighbors invade. recession 2 consecutive quarters negative growth? Q1 Q2 negative? Ummm......hey guys, notice naysayers here. research I've found multiple abuses forums. Abuses reported.  Yes. talking setting stage entire anti mask shit standing even encouraging idea people didn’t need mask. job isn’t political (he obv isn’t trying still felt need satiate trump). job honest. 

He wasn’t bad surgeon general, tell people didn’t need mask fact did. honest said panic buy masks since shortage, admin immediately seized secured enough ppe healthcare system. admin failed doesn’t mean feel like giving pass fauci regardless much respect him.

Dr. Birx even worse. feel like held accountable passiveness.

I aware early statements trying warn people coming since mid Jan. incredibly frustrated facui contradicting advice giving friends family, using face coverings avoiding crowds travel. got mom cancel trip Hawaii feb Covid task force still telling people travel normal buy masks. made hard justify mom safer staying home. Fauci, senior person task force, answer lies told public.

To clear everyone reading this; conspiracy guy shit like that. check post history I’ve active Covid discussions since early Jan, currently working field. found frustrated public official worried job telling us actual opinions. It’s fear mongering - think it’s inability many journalists fully understand vaccines work. I’m scientist initial understanding also vaccine would consist antibodies. guess level knowledge something acquire high school - you’re lucky. 
It would great read articles explain Covid vaccines really work instead leading people believe won’t effective antibodies disappear. Guys, relax. virus disappearing. beautiful. We're rounding corner basically gone. /s 2.6% CFR IFR?

Either way skewed one side. break age 
0.003% 0–19 years,
0.02% 20–49 years,
0.5% 50–69 years
5.4% 70+ years. 

Per CDC distance learning far. Wow! WAY boring thinking. Ha. Thanks kind redditor! Hopefully US see kind devastation NY saw. 30k dead almost instantly. Apocaletdown wife passed 7 month COVID ‘anniversary.’ still haven’t recovered smell taste, I’ve diagnosed ulcerative colitis.

My wife inflammation issues legs, wear heart monitor next 2 weeks palpitations having.

Both us 40, we’re healthy pre-COVID. Time buy RV culture, policy too. Europeans following mandates 1) there's little consequences 2) general populace self concerned realize everyone worked together, problem would over. kinda like game theory problem group prisoners collude, get jail time. However, someone snitches, they'll free assuming one else does. People always put best interest first, forget true best interested stay fuck home lol. Imagine risking death red fucking lobster Yeah guess got hourly wage fixed schedule can't really claim sick leave? big problem. people moving around worse going work elderly symptoms must huge risk factor. hope manage stay healthy! No, thankfully work rad store we're Black Friday year. love sane bosses.   least acknowledging real thing. least he's delusion beat it. people say believe conspiracy theories can't keep secret many people.

Pretty standard. They're convinced fall one conspiracy another slowly sucks in. cases HK imported, still local cases every day.

Taiwan succeeded acting really fast (with preemptive measures like blocking travel even H2H transmission confirmed). exported cases later turned false positives, countries ever bother publish another official announcement change former data.

What countries learn lies parts China: provinces managed prevent epidemic neighboring province ""on fire"". Tell I'm wrong. Oh look, stupid troll.

What surprise. die covid please catapult infected corpse white house lawn please Agreed. worst part I've heard like least five people voting Biden really think going magically disappear~ day. vector yes, can. That's different vaccines often required 6 month gap. body gains immunity vector fight another vaccine vector.

Most main players using different vectors though. Yea way said felt like implying deserved get stabbed tried grab phone. That's u got downvotes. southern Ohio, October nicest weather ever get - tons people outside right now. January February brutal indoor gatherings. That's always everyone know gets sick. come school starts late guys? distance learning far?  SEE YOU. cut Medicare Social Security benefits beneficiaries dead &lt;points many people, usually 40 years old, get mild symptoms (low fever, cough etc) thought it, - whats point testing. Plus testing means contact tracing may reveal something doing, elect tested alert friends themselves. need hospitalized theyll deal then. Otherwise recover never gets reported.

Im sure common would Asian country need beyond many aspects.  Interesting. says plasma treatment got ICU. study said hardly anything? prediction would, would not. Like throw trash bins enough assholes around see trash ground. effects moral perceived unity keeping covid19 bay? is. drunk people hug kiss WAY more, also inhibited mental restraints forget pandemic going on.

source: used security guard nightclubs younger lad. money's November 4th 1st 100k day. Oh irony. know - could really help Japans low birth rate. 

Now keep here... dunk container load pregnancy tests wastewater stream every often, *voila!* Problem solved 9 months. stop politicizing 

We still first wave according Fauci means virgin territory hit. Deaths low.

If 70 years old 99% chance surviving. won't. Putin also nudge changing stance. goal sow chaos distrust US government thus diminishing US influence. Trump GOP made masks identity politics. hill literally willing die (and people die) on. absurd fear mongering Classic Karen behavior seen people gas stations? grab food shove face germs. thing know certain exponential growth, using gloves sanitizer basic normal flu season things like carts gas pump handles....all shown stuff avg 🚽 Good luck you! Things bad side Atlantic too, least adults charge. grand picture many weeks lives, yes few. Better dead. zero cases, worth while. never claimed proof opposite.

What I've seeing people declaring means people immune, I'm asking evidence supporting declarative statements. Problem finished it, virus isn’t finished us.

This probably accurate way putting response virus. Yeah waiting stimulus, bought needed Christmas, I'm spending dollar beyond survive now. unpopular opinion many want hear. agree it’s human nature you’re right, Asian societies done great job, I’d say it’s different values Western countries. good society whole placed individual. Virtues like harmony important ‘freedom’.

Their responses public health crisis disasters (Fukushima example) means they’re willing accommodate protect vulnerable come together united response.

Obviously it’s utopian- “society individual” also reinforced idea people expected play certain roles. Sexism racism prominent countries like Japan, indigenous peoples ethnic minorities often face regular discrimination even genocide case Uighurs China. know America unlikely withstand businesses closing due virus. Either people risk getting sick 1% dying, lose fucking jobs businesses. Americans choose work food table giving shit Fauci says. Keep mind im way discounting seriousness virus unbiased affect economy population. Americans simply enough risk fucking feed families. think experts aware society different wavelengths comes comfortable things Fauci said expect Covid us till late would much, much better shape decisive federal leadership virus became widespread. 

Sorry link, mobile moment. Public health officials actually involved perverse incentives questionable ethical decisions.

Delusional point questionable paranoid disorder. Lockdown eradicate giant gamble though. vaccine released soon, worth it. stay shut another year lose decade growth, damage likely outweigh benefit. bad luck? think dumb move lol still see possibility. would likely see internal coup sorts (25th amendment sort thing). People realize far far checks balances government public sees (Nixon drunk lot implode). There's reason we've lasted 244 years whereas France went 4-5 republics timespan. system needs tweaking chop arm papercut. BAH GAWD thats COVID 19 music!? Dude way based subreddit. Calling based department speak Oh yay! Didnt change much practice tho lol. Still ended consecutive lockdown 3 months. 36 minutes find deal is. think I'm guna pop bottle champagne this...

Edit: reflect government explained lockdown/s March never said anything 4 week law. always vague (in order cause panic).  Thank  Newt Gingrich's whole adult life. Scam scam scam scam scam! Meh vent getting old.  think intentions good. think humans general want others happy safe healthy. could dangerous all. Nobody who’s retire risk exposed portfolios. socialism, retirement ages tend correlate SS Medicare, that’s already play watch TV unless want watch something. Otherwise listen audiobooks/read. 

My point worried device listening, cut power. even tho live Virginia Beach, still surreal! forget religion. church needs added list well. flippant attitude measure necessary sufficient control spread. callous. one saying denial. Project harder could show PowerPoints. Instead blaming increased testing trump thrown desantis whatever fuck they’re bus. leaving schools open? 

Because can't close them. kindergartens supermarkets, required keep country mean, know kids basically germ factories.

But according data have, super spreaders SARS-CoV-2. kins lockdown even close enough. long aa schools remain open people keep going work, continue spread, like country (czechia). know really alternative. *Jon Snow accent*

Winter coming. Lmfao. Man people extra That's uh, that's joke. Reasonable people worried:

* vulnerable loved ones
* getting disease long term unknown health effects
* vector spread responsible someone else's death suffering
* drain healthcare system causing healthcare-rationing situation

There plenty reasons concerned beyond death rate ""non-vulnerable"" person worry about. millions idiots think thing happen April buy dip every time goes throwing savings it.

It bounce back time, like before. get two record recoveries. Profiting business cost people's health lives. blame them. Sorry, business/livelihood greater someone's health life.

Maybe meant Easter 2022.  vaccine. vitamin shot placate masses/ignorant fools. vaccine widely distributed, pandemic over. They're going wait certain number people vaccinated lift restrictions. out, every man themselves. agreeing putting risk refusing vaccine.

Normal life return time next year timeline widely distributed vaccine April correct. Fauci clearly spent way much time browsing sub see, misunderstood. Like said, muted can't kill conspiracy rants without snide, cruel extremely annoyed. I've given them. said response news someone dying, also didnt want add tasteless dumpster fire tin hat rant.   would think identifying current hotspots trying tame spread pressing importance identifying began. help us fight current fight. put mask go something non-crowded setting? listed them, we'd rest year. NEIN! seems irrelevant said.

Regardless, checked stats months (been busy).But I'm looking 227k deaths today (October 28th) 8.85 million cases. CFR 2.6%?Isn't point IFR? underestimate CFR trying account untested cases may negative therefore linear CFR (asymptomatic cases, etc.)?

I'm definitely expert I'm glad corrected. I'm confused upper bound CFR lower simple calculation would imply.

Edit: Simply easy source - even wikipedia article easy read table COVID: CFR 0.82-9.64% IFR overall 0.27% September 9th. seems line US numbers. Wow actually balanced, non-extreme take lockdowns here. Color impressed! hope yet. Sewage leading indicator have, least far know. mean, admitted everything saying merely experts saying. Prior denied existence proof refused read LOL 120K? actually 227k right Trump loved MoaB (mother bombs) MoaO actually kinda brand Guess better renew gym membership since literally nothing closing I've also distinct luxury meeting one types mouth breathers. Actually French law allow force lockdown 4 weeks once. That's extended lot spring Remindme! 1 January But, but, but. white house said pandemic over. Unless new thing, fuckedemic. many maimings??? Allegedly required they're performing. see cameramen wearing example. clue well enforced backstage though. I'm guessing very. yeah people think lockdown last month deluding lol. probably lockdown vaccine think always knew existed, never realized MUCH existed, know? catch shit, get anyone else sick

Today: help im fire Pelosi say republicans yield 1.8 trillion stimulus? know. I'm Canadian reading American news. CNN grills Pelosi saying take deal, Pelosi fought back saying represents starving people. Maybe reason people starving Pelosi represents them. win republicans, could spun said forced go 1.8 trillion wants $500billion. fact want Trump wins election. That's fucking evil. think that's good strategy, fucking evil too. Give people money shut economy. pay people force stay home. mean *this* election. mean system political action consequences elections. R always refuse measure short term impact increases costs want win elections. Yeah that's true. someone died virus 80s, carry much weight lot people healthy person 20s know headline writers fun one least.  Also covid viewed affecting primarily older people, West sees elders generally disposable. Polio affected people visceral level - kids. want upvote 100 times. Everything internet part stupid American culture war incredibly tiresome.  One issue mask mandates work nobody knows working.

Another issue lack STEM education generally America people understand statistics work preferable become one. wish people would post somewhere Washington Post Bezos paywall seem think mask mandates created equally.

There lots variables affect result, including compliance, level enforcement, penalties noncompliance, etc.

You can't say one mask mandate failed somewhere earth work must necessarily fail.

You prove can't work, South Korea shows us, among examples, can. ""Why homeschooling 3 elementary kids fall? school person classes.""

""Golly, dunno."" I’m hoping Tuesday start Probably nowhere near high. think we’ll hit ceiling around half number, maybe even closer 500k-750k dead. IFRs currently estimated around 0.3-0.5%, herd immunity level probably much lower 80% whatever number use trot out.

Still, we’re halfway best-case scenario, that’s pretty brutal. ...I wasn’t picking argument anyone, read conversation nothing less completely civil. Germany France also closing. Czechia similar issues. 

Just take care best can. It’s harrowing go this. We’re dealing “lack information “ though. We’re dealing lack information supports hypothesis virus acts differently every virus world. 

Usually means disregard hypothesis, wait around claiming somehow it’ll proven true future. 

We tremendous amounts information would point hypothesis true. doesn’t exist. ok buy hold long-term mostly funds (not individual stocks), markets recover done more-or-less fine.

The tricky part figuring buy bunch lower prices, aside regular monthly buy. one thing trump show us underbelly. exit strategy things get ugly. pandemic pass, normalcy resume, point next year two.

There'll cultural adjustments. Perhaps it'll killed movie theaters, made people WFH - everyone, people wear masks sick/on subways winter.

But permanently changed, fundamentally. we. Ah yeah, long keep printing money pay tremendous debt? Let shed light North Dakota resident biggest city:

North Dakota SD conservative states union. people anti mask. mentality mask wearing conservative vs liberal issue. statement defiant.

Also, lot science deniers, lot bullshit death rate low. I've given hard time many occasions going bars house parties. Everyone given quit caring. We've turned corner. arrogant twat. That's what's wrong. - everyone gets flu going paranoid wondering Covid. It’s worth increased possibility peace mind. Ah well let know kills everyone party difference world economy crashes oil prices drop lot, America recover. Russia collapse. Nope immune response seems robust lasting Thanks doctor.

Both moods make violent bipolar disorder simply cut-out case different person person. Trump right said rounding corner... wrong one. Strict **global** lockdown 3 months. way without vaccine.  mention Ford encouraging people see families ""safely"" long ago. Grow balls tell people stay home.

He can't himself, can't tell people it.

I know people keep saying Ford good job. could worse job, mean good job. RIP Herman Cain, gave took one team. Love name. Definitely me. Can't find job chemical engineer Colorado. Taking toll self esteem. think possible nobody told Turner anything 7th inning, positive result came back.

All players getting tests every day. Apparently 2nd inning MLB people charge testing learned Turner's test yesterday come back inconclusive — fast-tracked test today, came back positive 7th inning pulled.

Still, weird players' test results back game time. Turner certainly gone back field win, least gotten close teammates. dont think people think things through.

They hear something could make sense think theyre smarter everyone else figuring out.

Correlation imply causation, people. yet post here, makes bigger joke. many mg vitamin take? get stomach aches afterwards? kids fan at-home learning, thankfully they're ridiculously understanding given situation. understand going school means could get sick, want sick get anyone else sick.

They miss friends normal classroom though. oldest child mentioned many times ""won't take class granted ever again.""

The sheriff county blanket refusal enforce covid related restrictions. rapid test requires higher viral load detect positive, always trigger positive enough virus detected?

""Always"" strong statement. think possibility human error (contaminated sample swabbing properly) quite measurable. seems hard reconcile science (that says false positives never happen) seems like always happens infected infectious, small viral load rapid test pick up?

In theory threshhold positive test orders magnitude lower ideally 

Ideally want catch every infection. need to. need R&lt;1. baseline R 4 need prevent 75% transmissions. Keep mind China still genociding Uyghurs today GOP syncophants would rather kill people contradict Trump's lies masks. Pathetic multivitamins contain pitifully small dose Vitamin - like 4-700 IUs likely need 2000+ supplementing. helping ladies moms friend group kill mic one mentioned hospital bumping covid lie. benefit hospital number decides shutdown measures????? fun killing people greed. good thing must administering PCR tests, highly sensitive. Meaning since they're tested daily World Series bubble likely caught early could contagious spread staff/teammates opposing players. science already there. publishing pieces like these, means consensus clearly favoring them. Even work 100%, using mask reduces initial viral inoculum thus probably also symptom severity.

But people engage activities masks can't used get infected (bars, restaurants, private parties gatherings), proof masks work. sure don't. want inheritance money. Oh half state fire emergency services bit maxed right now. Singapore, S. Korea/Vietnam reporting issues stopping giving flu vaccines due uptick deaths.

I'll give bit advice free. exercise, make sure sleep enough, eat little meat, eat lot veggies, watch fried stuff sugar. Make sure get plenty water. Keep calm. relaxation / meditation take vitamins, herbs supplements like Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Magnesium, Potassium Turmeric based body reacts well to.

Most us bother flu vaccine (I one decades ever) healthy immune system keeps check. That's something public health official wants tell people prefer vaccines, drugs dangerous side effects like Remdesevir full repertoire western medicine.

Which shame majority healthy people covid + flu nothing minor issue. 

Keep healthy folks, panic try let body best ;) George W would best President Pandemic. first week took office met Fauci wanted informed biological terrorist threats America. Fauci told Bush pandemics likely. Bush told Fauci he'd get whatever resources needed prepared. Highest priority.

Before Trump American Presidents understood importance fighting infectious diseases. Fauci talked H.W. started first worldwide fight AIDS George W ran fight multiple infectious diseases way enforce that.

They way enforcing law every single person goes visits family, way heavily fining people catch visiting family.

The question becomes: worth risk hefty fines and/or jail time? think idea deter behaviour, knowing full-well can't completely control stop it. falungong video funded CIA


funny backfired don’t wait long. New consoles come 10 12 November. crowd camp overnight outside store even though told preorders. expect dozens people camping day consoles come unless cops actually enforce laws. polling this. 35%+ going get ASAP people dropping dead 2 weeks, another 20%+ follow suit. massive amount exhausted people anything point end this. Pretend biological weapon... Maybe help

Edit: comment offensive please lemme know why, I'll delete don’t know permanent lung damage 7 months pandemic. Yes allow technicality - long pandemic thing, non-profit. dispute that?

“Subjective” - opinion. USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! USA! really matter unless intend stay closed forever seems like 90% comments sub lately people brigading us anti-science subs. ""alarmist"" trying tell telling people immune first infection likely get people killed think longer need cautious. I’m getting tired seeing posts I’m US resident, posts give impression someone expecting magically come US gov something make happen... idea caught it? live apartment? I'd say populations traditionally centered around idea community, individuality.

That literally root. Congrats twins! Hopefully get make amazing memories better days. Spooky downplaying it, tough going, take issue people say we've harsh lockdown 6 months similar statements, think often put forward people critical lockdowns generally try make sound bad possibly can.
You still wrong way, clauses permit visitors first wave permitted exercise outdoors members household, permitted hook friends park even sit bench park.
I know affected personally. 
When stage 3 restrictions reintroduced July golf fishing permitted, neither allowed April, disallowed August 2nd went stage 4.
But onwards upwards, let's hope lockdowns thing past Melbourne. Hungary closed borders Sept 1. work.. think see extremely effective vaccine maybe even vaccine prevents transmission least third generation vaccines.

Making ideal vaccine corona virus going tricky people realize completely possible.

Uptake point whole different story. business closed policy (i.e. governor said can't open, like bar gym) people shopping like used whatever reason (fear, less money).

It sounds like talking businesses closed consumer behavior, talking about. Yes, doubt lots businesses suffering. think lot demand governor shut specific businesses would thriving forced shut down. Therefore can't really call closing businesses victims shut down. Victims covid, sure, specifically shut down. kind point article.

Yes, early restrictions, fairly quick pretty lax. grew middle nowhere Illinois. Early pandemic, friends bitching left right restrictions Chicago's fault.

And Covid used live... use banner? Yea, proof handle episodes like better. hope become weapon. bit isn’t true? unblinding “imminent” according Adrian Hill, man running trials. Given Pfizer haven’t unblinded yet either don’t see can’t close?

Also, Oxford massive head start paused week.  increase cases caused testing (test more, numbers go up) also increase real spread virus.

In words obvious correlation testing case numbers correlation perfect.

Hospitalizations deaths also increased, still peak levels. Cases slightly higher peak deaths way peak. could locked fuck right away could dealt dragged made infinitely worse everyone. 

Just like EVERY modern country did! Imagine?! 

But guess hoaxing keep trump office. love lockdown 9 months except groceries running Canada - ensure democrats US take call pandemic January! think Merkel heads German Länder know this? correct happened March April, infections low citizens willing necessary greater good.

Your article posted indicated people sick lockdowns massive fatigue. attempt revert strategies implemented March April met massive resistance. Look Italians right protests. People enough!!

I think try something different instead regs sub say, “Fuck you!! You’re scientist!! won’t work!! Lockdowns solution!!” Although lockdowns help stop spread virus, doesn’t work don’t buy-in general public.

I think taking Vitamin effective non-pharmaceutical intervention need informed public tools available disposal help fight disease. saves least one life, it’s worth talking about. think information suppression lockdowns option go ahead downvote me! bad trump Chinese everywhere. Especially since virus already world wide point. 

Funny little fucking isnt it? that’s measure man surely believe Sweden spread spring. Week 15 3739 cases 664 deaths. Week 41 4278 cases 21 deaths. People apt die spring? Make new plans. talking compliance, pretty much near 100% people wearing masks here. become symbol side politics on, like US, deeply regrets.

Yeah people wearing masks intentionally city millions widely accepted short period time government implemented mandate. also heavy fines non compliance police actively enforce.

It also definitely contributed getting numbers back low, along measures. Ummm. Yeah, that. sound like ex friends didn’t believe coming started sharing leaked info group. really enjoy comments pandemic fatigue, obvious signs mental capacity issues, likely don’t cover nose wear mask. 

Enjoy winter. Come back post January let us know things going you! :) tried sublingual delivery? [Drops instant dissolve stuff like supplement zinc kills stomach unless take meal. tried taking full stomach? need bite...so eat couple eggs morning order take supplements else get seriously nauseous. eat, issues.

Everyone taking K2 magnesium Vitamin well help absorption well mitigating calcification soft tissue. No? magic system based capitalism mind? Apparently communism. Anarchy? Monarchy? Feudalism maybe?

Oh wait know, must *socialism*. Post-event full-body massage banner job well done: $???,???,??? I'm sure must strict gun laws. World series champion pretty good one. I'm squeamish also, quickly unbearable. let swab her, seriously doubt it, would probably ok hold hand focus holding tight blink. surreal see pandemic completely flipped script decades Cold War propaganda. 

Now we're applauding China (rightly believe) clearly effective action issue. Yes, inaction beginning largely condemned us strife, failures truly 8+ months. nation size population China handle virus, reason USA can't leaderpship. needed tested yet, I'm hoping hold tests like available. nasal trouble kid makes passages bend odd angles, really want swab stuck brain. Sweden also getting crushed right compared rest Europe. rolling 7 day average deaths 1-3 3 months now. philosophy avoidable release lockdown, disease spread, happening. took lump early, we'll see winter treats them, looking right. You’ll see lot election. Democrat governors scared shut anything right now. See America, classrooms haven’t even windows ones keep closed due shooters/intruders 😕 fall rain/winter weather approaching, it’s necessary keep closed. yet European countries already expanded rules lower spread; curfews, closing certain types retail establishments, etc. let citizens know upfront measure protect deadly disease egg flow u til yet means what’s known contain it, don’t like measures, see rates rising know measures coming. 

My daughter family live Italy. first additional measure wear makes time outside house. adding go along.

Here, demagogue complaining, President Obama noted, COVID’s ratings higher his. lies nothing deal it; would admitting wrong minimize first place. Please please please, release statistics mean median age group druing covid, matter Especially since we've told last decade ""protect privacy!"" Sadly? required carry me. Thought Screens stayed home too, left home 1984 worry people. get modern world infringe upon people's privacy, redditors get excited whenever see comparisons 1984. People like believe they'd never capable things like that, even heat moment. truth we're capable beautiful terrible things.  ""good"" person mean we're incapable evil, means choose good.

Stabbing someone large number times screams anger lack reason anything else me. Stabbing someone kill calculated murder. u test u get cases, hello!?!? Sure, flu, bro

 /s Ed replied like 7 times. Yet won’t conversation creep? confusing. Courious much longer keep trying degrade someone? You’re like trained dog. post trigger words flustered talking talking creepy people. Q is, try get last word still? Waiting. 12 year olds certainly capacity consent.

In Canada, health-related decision, healthcare professional assess patient's capacity demonstrated sufficiently consent without approval anyone else (parent, caretaker, etc.). 

Whether think vaccine trial different standards another discussion, belief people age 18 cannot make decisions regarding health antiquated honest though.... 95% efficacy would save lot lives. 


Your thought scenario seems letting perfection enemy good. current status quo literally ignoring problem clearly contributed immensely spread. time [realizes Oh irony....If wouldn´t sad...  asymptomatic spreading it? Many us earlier dip well. Huge shorts all-in TSLA. (Discussed often China fly sub Jan &amp; Fev.) obvious before. Heck, even Gov officials timed well, too. time much tricky possibility may see dip - lag. Pulled market completely yesterday. know something coming - don’t grip timing. going short time around, try time buying close bottom dip happens. It’s confusing hell time around markets may may things become control cases US Dec, Jan, etc. 3 times day maskless rallies thousands ~~people~~ boneheads across America surely it. know work phylogenetic tree best website see. color coded show allelic differences origin based mutations.

And citation pretty much common sense far needing flu shot every year. Flu shots good life thing. I’ve never used anything like that. Unless you’re high risk situation needs something better would probably well using disposable surgical mask. protested measures get measures first place lol ironic
Thanks ruining Christmas, deniers... US market tanking due lack stimulus majority country’s unemployment insurance ends December. get cold, rest world gets fever. 

Now stimulus due McConnell even entertaining idea closing session, expect big market crash. They’ve propping thought Congress would come (especially since Fed can’t cut interest rates lower! nothing left leverage announced week.) Unfortunately Mnuchin Pelosi come agreement, McConnell doesn’t think it’s necessary. wants bet Trump mandates masks immediately wins election? essential you’re using medical purposes. dads fighting cancer it. wouldn’t eat without it, thing help chemo side effects. experience dispensaries vigilant masks sanitation. 

Liquor stores also essential addiction literally die drinking. Mexico closed liquor stores ugly. Economies scale useful sometimes, think hit nail head America's overall deficiencies compared parts north Europe. 

Smaller administrative units much easier administer effectively. lack infrastructure, something external bad planning? Republicans want kill medicare they'll start killing recipients first. Vaccine eradication borders closed would bring forward, tbf.

We've music festivals pretty much weekly last month Perth. Last case community April, eradicated lockdown, borders kept since.

Europe Europe, know, look. France lockdown. Germany Italy too. Spain, knows many more.

Why lockdown eradication goal, borders closed countries taking ""let rip"" path? astounding amount distance ""capable violence"" ""I stabbed someone 27 times sister held down.""

That's point here. They're same, people understand that.  prefer think ""only someone insane would that"" even ""I could see becoming angry extreme case hit someone, would never, ever that"".

The truth we're closer able awful things realize. That's human. grew campaign schools adult instinctively grab hat I'm going outside 10-15 minutes. Seriously. takes hour run PCR test (from I've read). That's plenty time administer test arrive ballpark get results first pitch... even rerun sample two. everyone it, one get it. Right? reasonable assume actuality worse past simply testing enough?

No, already widespread testing done before... trump interview white dude , insisting cases per testing testing folks “ever before”.  listen people tell want hear please ask get involved CCP propaganda. I'm broke college student need money. Shame trying undercount. They're still slightly excess deaths, degree others. First think need look meaning order magnitude. I’m sure know really means. Second didn’t saw Europe. Never Tegnell. Third Tegnell didn’t put time frame it. Maybe read article see said. What’s happening today isn’t line said. Maybe disagree believe would odd man out. Well, severall million people disagree that. EU competitive! want US winners forever. 

Seriously idea wtf going there. truly shame. really burns is, penalty. specific towns fine masked, catch act. honest questions saying yes indoor dining cafe, assuming cafe following rules too, like going trouble something. going let cafe employees know.

I read ppl actually respond, something like 55 % done indoor dining. That's chose example. Maybe actually bad indoor dine follow Covid rules, we'll never know sure people answer basic questions! awesome, assume unlike hundred similar studies, one become available.... creeps  Better late never phrase see matters lot. 


Far many people letting perfection enemy mediocre. somewhat proud France Germany actually courage say 'mia culpa' act severe rather ignore problem, like Brazil USA.  Dodgers half-as$ed dodging Covid. seen several strains already going immune one different previous one.

[Citation needed] eyes read all. forward looking.

Every paragraph past tense literally says 2017-2020 talks first term accomplishments.

You gaslighted yourself. would make sense. Would great demographic data verify. Giants fan, yet another reason say: FUCK DODGERS Vitamin kills stomach though. suggestions? found 50% reduction spread COVID-19
in counties mask mandate compared to
those Masks eliminate COVID, significantly
slow spread disease.

 would interesting could included random sampling compliance order.  county Texas, slow daily count new cases generally good mask compliance shops/stores. However, also see people eating restaurants capacities would scare anybody reddit. I’m waiting Trump play “Up Around Bend” one rallies CCR next Kong list artists attempt sue him. Jimmy Carter US Navy officer. John Kerry (who lost Dubya 2004) infantryman Vietnam, complete two purple hearts. work hair salon Ohio. fight people every single day mask service without one. stand foot faces still find necessary. Part feels would better shut down. Sweden, including Tegnell, seemed listen back then. Judging people complaining packed restaurants, keeping things open may save businesses. Mushrooms legal Denver. 

Additionally Oregon psilocybin therapy ballot, looks like going pass, could come get dose doctor help alleviate anxiety/depression. Might years though Yes no. ""memory"" virus good reason get flu shot every season. know years Covid looks like. seen several strains already going immune one different previous one. 

So yes right little overblown way think get good forever. Happy Halloween! weekends gonna bloodbath Call old-fashioned, trust kids :') 


Packing 500+ kids small areas like sardines. Putting onus wear masks day (even meals?), shenanigans, touching pushing other. Really think handle this? can't even handle normal cold flu seasons. makes think handle new disease?

Shenanigans kids do. they're going misbehave occasion, better small family pods groups 500+ You’re seriously holding another country that’s terribly saying “Well least aren’t terrible” that’s achievement? Quick what’s 5x35,000? 230,000? multiplication still taught school? actually don’t think state local leaders ever ruled lockdowns, think they’re waiting point declaring lockdown won’t hugely damaging politically headline read, Parents volunteer children lab rats. don’t think people care aren’t seeing effects happens hospitals viscerally say polio saw pics kids iron lungs saw neighborhood kid crutches wheelchair. Social distancing types closures uncommon height polio spread either. developed effective vaccine deployment people don’t think twice it. Moreso, apparent ever, Australians bit view ""for greater good"", even means personal sacrifice.

We see high fines driving whilst playing phone, random breath tests, gun control, socialised healthcare. get wrong idea this, saying we're ""trading liberty illusion security"", Australian going go like ""drunk drivers killing X/yr, we're going reduce it"", we'll consider minute go ""fair enough"".

It's like lot things, reasoned trade-offs vs knee-jerk ""but I'm good drunk driver, test people can't tell drunk outside car"" etc. acceptance mild inconvenience, greater good. really Sandford, UK.  going get worse halloween parties weekend. Isn’t kind misleading headline? I’m nutty Trump-anti-mask side this, peak pandemic states testing wasn’t even close readily available, knows infection rates actually point... doesn’t change cases spiking, situation alarming is, don’t feel like amplifying productive. Brittons findings quite speculative pandemic. Early predicted herd immunity threshold (60% infected) would reached already May Stockholm. 

I would take calculations large grain salt. [Trump’s promised Covid magically disappear ~40 times last 6 didn’t believe first 39 times, I’m positive it’ll gone next week. feel like that's close enlightenment achieve. conversation then? Rounding corner? pandemic over, work still telling work home 2021 kid's daycare still closed. Also, I'm still wearing masks go outside yet pandemic over. Hell, people still testing positive White House. per 100k) death rate three times higher Sweden’s (0,2) right now.

... past two weeks. takes Sweden 2-3 weeks register deaths Denmark lag. two weeks Sweden 0,4. Since we’ve seen exponential increase parameters.

So compare Swedens death rate last two weeks Denmark country meaningful. 

&amp;#x200B;

Sweden compared Denmark right now:

1/3 deaths per day

Same new cases per day

2x hospitalised

2x ICU

1/3 amount tests

3x share positive tests Today’s yesterday’s

[link CDC study referenced Oh. I'm pretty positive numbers useless US track recoveries. logic says pandemic everyone it, pre-existing condition popular. sure, fits national image mateship.

My friend also enlightened another : Australia, Europeans really can't live without aid, dependent govt long time. Rural still are. built infrastructure, yknow profitable otherwise, etc.

Americans though, overthrow govt. hindrance.

Those different pasts define large cultural difference modern day. still turn govt, turn often turns advisors (not climate change, exceeds this), crisis. Additionally, threat royal commission go recommendation cause mass suffering *still* keeps little honest.

I know true historical comment was, rang true enough figure picking cultural elements there. Stuck me. Yeah TK got flu shot Germany last year; pay officially give reason. doctor said reason acceptable, though (i.e. ""I travel lot"" ""I elderly grandparents""). year got flu shot US a) free, b) got $5 gift card, c) feeling gonna issue since particulary easy get flu shot without pandamic.

Well I’d hope considering tax payers ones paid doses first place person got paid money write this. 

Looking forward next article: Soldiers frontlines likely get shot enemy combatants. good vaccine efficacy signal could well boost hygiene morale, saving many lives.

If efficacy so-so, however, dare winter, weak stop caring infect others en masse. Good. Europe showing right way handle flare-ups cases.

So best way respond failure one harshest lockdowns Europe... another harsh lockdown? offical /r/coronavirus mask stance:

- cases go up, people wearing masks

- cases go down, masks

- Cases cannot go without masks can't go masks e saying since April. wreck end? It’s absolutely exhausting enraging. Yes! 100%! *This* way messaged things beginning. Everybody started learn COVID immediately impression ""two-week"" thing. immediately gave rise whole ""14-day quarantine symptoms"" thing, even though know virus infectious symptoms show up, remain sick much longer 14 days. Heck, people contracted virus March still testing positive today!

Yes, understand, know everything time; even novel virus beginning now. However, *that given bureaucratic health authorities right make haphazard statements disease's incubation period*. honest said ""we know"", instead making amounts blind guess. thought even came supporting lockdowns now.

No. People hometown snort opioids work. wait work add beers. Also huge east asian population (all handled pandemic well) . history SARS containment , wearing uniforms , decent effective government socialized medical systems . finally nearing summer nearing winter rest north.

No way suggesting is/could pure interest. Effectively longer efficacy signal takes reach given increasing prevalence virus population higher probability vaccine effective. 1000% meant one one season next. (That comparison flu shot. Seasonal) Perhaps could worded better end.

Yes, could worded better. specifically talking present tense, people took talking present...and defended while, I'm sure moving goalposts ""I talking future"" stuff. 

Also, that's still bull crap. 

We know seasonal variation going enough require new vaccine not, yet!

For flu vaccine, usually target top couple strains expect circulate combine one vaccine. There's dozens circulating strains vaccine work against. get second strain floating around next year, unlikely possible, produce shot vaccinates both, 3 whatever, like flu... like politicians, like Bidens face said.

Remind Me! 2 weeks Localized outbreaks might occur, certainly safe effective vaccine distributed, maybe even well (on smaller level). hopefully, winter, days many different states Covid outbreaks simultaneously over.

Also Colorado fairly big spike Covid cases. Anyone remotely paying attention time knew 2 weeks wasnt going enough. Like others said, come say 3 months right away, they'll less support. Printing money hand solution. End lockdowns, let people go back work.

We've zero cases half year. Nobody wears masks anymore, COVID never happened.

Back March, wore masks. brought small bottle hand sanitizer us. used contact tracing app whenever entered premise. Schools shut down. Lines drawn everywhere social distance. Everyone willingly. Everybody box masks home . mass testing.

Due job duties, keep working Boston. rest us can't go wait potential shut down. apartment area incredibly high population density it'll much risky. numbers much lower NYS home populations spread out. 

""Highly discourages"" total stoppage travel - yet. blue wave rises higher US, it'll happen. 

The uncertainty unsettling. get focused. 8 months instead decade whole lot focus. would one shortcuts needed “focused” situation like this. 

The FDA also cited possibility less conventional approaches. One approach would allow “accelerated approval” vaccine based antibody levels another biochemical marker rather actual clinical outcomes. could occur “additional understanding SARS-CoV-2 immunology, specifically vaccine immune responses might reasonably likely predict protection COVID-19, acquired.”2(p18 Yea last time remember took bankruptcies mass layoffs markets things really bottomed out. ever retail investors playing market computer systems real trading playing news surface. seems like news gets real computers trigger massive sell off. wildcard money already pumped propping prices people say rich people better put money, even next interest bond better losing market. dosage take? here. ridiculous many people see wearing masks. course, varies depending are. Cabela's watched mask-less customer 10-minute conversation employee, pulling mask talk entire time. boat sailed long time ago. government financial tools keep economy afloat long Europe intertwined close borders like New Zealand Australia. I...feel clever. Thanks. busy public spaces mask wearing compulsory everywhere. Brussels Capital Region compulsory entire territory. people seem actually wearing them, even though sometimes see people still wearing wrong. 

There also strict, although hard enforce, regulations many people meet. example we're supposed 1 ""cuddle friend"" (that is, person around need wear mask) apart household. Cultural centers sports facilities closed Friday (maybe sooner, there's backlash regulations kicking late). Bars restaurants already closed since last week so. situation overall looks control. Lol look much failure is. Fortunately deaths breached previous records! 330 million 33... would take two years rate 100% infection, would result millions deaths probably destroy healthcare system. I’m triggered way health care worker wearing mask! DUDE! Pull pinch shut! wrong you??? 

I would love cheap, effective tests available soon could start people again. apt die spring?

Well, yes... proven fact fatality rate COVID19 dropped significantly last several months.

Every nation seeing much lower percentage deaths second wave first. major reason advancements made doctors regarding treatment COVID patients. saving lives know much disease treat it.

In fact, one major reasons experts criticising Swedish strategy - every outbreak novel viral disease, greater percentage people die initial phases nothing known disease, later stages doctors found treatments work.

That many dead Sweden die. infected rather April, would much greater chance surviving. feeling? know got it? people, actual scientists discussing issue. turns fucked using Flintstones chewable vitamins placebo Wow, something. discovered stupid comments Reddit?  Churchill joins conversation. Yee Hi, please don't! Please consider checking r/covid19_support That’s smart. don’t understand 17,500 people placebo don’t 32 infections. know virus highly infectious.

Edit: sorry it’s 18,000. Maybe finished giving second doses? repercussions everything do, sadly seems US hyper-focused one side conversation. feel terrible people dealing things business owners hope. People laid struggling bills kids sent back-n-forth school every week. It’s awful around things deserve attention. know kind studies? obstructionist say ""We know certain problem"" try fix problem

This shows nurses need better PPE. listened nursing posting social media? talk reuse masks, eat drink can't replace mask take off, etc. say administration says fine, need PPE better PPE.


In capitalist society focused short term profit, indeed need verify water wet, someone try make profit expense someone else's safety say isn't, idea. one side babbling incoherent swamp creature almost 50 years shown breathtakingly corrupt, man presided one strongest economies time, rapidly expanding middle east peace deal, unprecedented reduction worthless regulation widespread tax cut. That's MO power hot minute. Split us along surface level policy debates rob us blind. They've pretty successful. means people asymptomatic Kevin Cash really saved MLB’s ass pulling Snell probably figured already exposed rest teammates anyway, everyone around would get tested isolate, quarantine, etc. anyway. said, even figured already exposed everyone, still stay fuck away case missed exposing someone/so give exposure everyone. Social circles neat, closed circles. Everybody slightly different circle overlap. plus get groceries essential workers still working means lock help bring spread, can't fully stop spread. RECKLESS man I’m afraid still beginning middle won’t come closer end January cure going much worse disease. intakes, vents filters? Really, thank you, no, no, thank Well surprise. cops thumbnail even wearing masks right. No, no, thank Ugh Schools super spreader locations. Alwaye been. That’s works.

Vaccines help prevent disease percentage, top percentage, likely reduce severity disease even more. vaccinated, it’s novel virus anymore, likely memory cells antibodies.

If 40% protected, spread significantly reduced well. higher percentage gets less sick without vaccine, death rate, already low, go yet further.

Here, getting close risk opening fully well within society’s risk tolerance.

Once happens, society opens, go back normal take mask and... healthy... stop logging onto r/coronavirus. 

I suspect point, becomes sort like Swine Flu like. People talked news story nobody changed behavior life went on. parents administrators need taught brutal lesson value educators.

Not American ones. Sars probably closest example virus like went away wish could beat things simply giving shit. shutdowns gonna work dude need build hospitals hire nurses mass produce tests, look china korea. implementing shutdowns everytime get x cases/infection rates reopen back ignoring much essential workers are, arent essential, gonna starve? Fed infinite ability inject money market too. ridiculous, they'll prop right back wish What? war? expand though, places counting effectively almost exclusively much less severe outbreaks Belgium had. ask things worse Belgium Germany, answer Germany stopped spread. compare Netherlands, UK, Spain, US, I'm pretty sure countries undercounting. Schools businesses remain open. Well thankfully that's works US balanced comment, fear mongering way gross hyperbole. 

Enacting measured lockdown curb pandemic scale severity SARS-COV-2 symptom ""tyrannical unchecked totalitarian government rule.""

I find intellectually dishonest people opposed pandemic lockdown create strawmen grossly exaggerate issue order argue easy counterpoint. Nobody suggesting United States weld people homes ""have personal liberties rights taken away us eternity.""

That's ridiculous exaggeration, believe that's ""balanced, non-extreme take,"" would sincerely suggest try gain perspective. far worried rather fast rate businesses opening. California going slower. counties area soon allow indoor restaurants open 50% capacity far dangerous. Thanks defending them, I’ve seen way many people try argue places ought shut asap, ideally yeah sure it’s like anyone stepped provide income meantime. work home EXTREME privilege. feel like lot people don’t know privileged able work home whole time, sitting couch shitting businesses trying stay afloat. minimizing outbreaks states worse? Boulder institute lockdown/curfew students.

I wonder people Boulder would feel same? I've back working outside home since mid-May. incredibly draining, hyper-vigilant also take stress/worries employees try keep morale.

Yup. important us takes reducing transmission seriously. end decisions us make daily basis determine fast far thing goes.  got owned much. Ass beat. still misunderstanding...

(To clear, no, scenario OK) I'm well aware (mostly) healthy young guy, chances dying low. 1. could still seriously injured virus, possibly months even permanently 2. could spread virus someone vulnerable, parents live with, chances getting unscathed much worse mine  You’re correct. time; wonder much American population would obeying rules administration taken seriously beginning. 

When half American political system takes stance virus isn’t big deal it’s hard expect general population take seriously. fare better every asset class much, forward yield loses inflation.

What? People also working 1st lockdown without masks. Little kids big spreaders students high school remote.

Not forget France 1.9 million tests/week moment vs 150 000 tests/week back April. Big difference find clusters. damn depressing thing allowed go work go school.

Lol yes exactly point Yeah, 24% higher hospitalization rate. could death rate overrun hospitals actually higher amount people need hospitalization first place?

Yes, rate would shoot quite bit, 24% seems utterly ridiculous.

Compare:

""This vaccine improve situation bit, measures go years, better vaccine found.""

""This vaccine prevent severe disease drastically reduce transmission. Around spring, measures reduced. let guards summer."" People already gave up. tacitly accepted covid new reality live with. every death collective punishment.

It doesnt hurt tell like is, give people misguided optimism. That's said banning stuff like indoor dining. meant stuff context businesses deemed non essential like barbers, clothing stores, gyms. definitely alot businesses close shop dont get wrong several states time based whether large amounts infections still lockdown like European countries done.

Please re-read block quote article above.

They said give intensive care people statistically greater risk. take account individual circumstances, give up.

Also, transfer people somewhere could get oxygen basic level care. euthanasia pills shrug. Find case child without severe health issues COVID killed.

That undermine individual tragedy deaths, course. mean take “It kill children!!!” hysteria argument. Kids disease vectors at-risk populations—that’s public health issue them. Losing entire livelihood versus dying. counts delay month, that's long takes average people die get infected. first wave deaths peaked mid April, month lockdown began.

I'm aware delay although think changes anything. lockdown March still started 11 days death count hit numbers today. we're effectively starting lockdown two weeks later March. 

The case count spring lot lower test much now. go case counts one month first 80 deaths per day spring, case numbers around 16 cases per day, obviously far actual case numbers time. know, could've 2500 cases detected barely anyone got tested February. sure point is.

I really care extent US blame, give country 100% blame far I'm concerned, mainly surprised parent said four failed coup attempts US year 2020, heard beyond Venezuela, keeping relatively top news year (albeit focus pandemic news). want comment debate hand ask, really think 9,000,000 people United States contracted this? difficult. Cuomo new york lock downs zip code reach 3% positivity rate. That's proper way avoid outbreaks. Mm yeah makes feel better low empathy.

That’s 0.018%, true mortality rate likely much lower unreported cases. vast, vast majority children get don’t experience anything mild sickness. 

You talk anecdotally kids unfortunately died covid that’s really anecdote. News sources post stories like “little kid died covid” gets views clicks scared people - “kid gets covid recovers without problems” doesn’t exactly get much attention headline. 

I’m sick shit people acting like virus certain death, especially people like apply children. makes think people brainwashed sub lost perspective. government job support public crisis none concerns valid.

Hundreds thousands people die next decades fact government cannot spend much money public health repaying debt support. I'm talking US, I'm talking medium sized European country.

Government's cannot ""support"" people mass lockdown again. Lol good luck. going able leave country many many, many years. fucked like rest us. wearing mask vaccine deployed. can. won't. Lockdowns fail small-brained amongst citizenry skirt outright ignore them. that's unfortunately large demographic *every* country. guess thinking mass immigration waves occurred centuries - went smoothly. grandmother landed Ellis Island (along 15 million immigrants early 20th century) - poor, speak word english, worked hard, built life, am. also Democrats

On national level, Democrats bashing heads wall trying can, unfortunately wall made Republicans power. 

http://www.bidencovidplan.com Actually it’s necessary people properly wearing masks. Going dr weed CO equivalent going doc aspirin. Like slew people use medically. I’m gonna convince it’s essential, don’t understand system works. Well, spikes aren’t higher plateau, don’t really win anything, you? check out, pretty much European countries completely overwhelmed cases right now. sad covid spread , like working home socialize much anymore. conspiracy. Fact. Simple googling around topic reveals already running playbook. shitting? France? Switzerland? Italy? Czech? Spain? Belgium? 3-6 times worse per capita.

Wow, downvoted facts. Classic reddit. run Governor! couple weeks ago, one family I've heard first friend-of-a-friend story son went party wound killing father. anonymous story, neighbor knows family personally.

The hits slowly getting closer. don't. Schools workplaces major drivers spread. huge problem close send kids/teens home. take measures hope enough keep R-value 1. Germany. hope works.  Children extremely unlikely die severe complications COVID. unless child immunocompromised, almost nothing worry about. real public health issue spread virus others, especially older adults households.

So real question this: think social, emotional, academic delays children worth losing ~1% population, vast majority elderly? it’s fine don’t think that’s worthy trade-off, it’s like vast majority kids risk death severe complications. Hey man, Im back check ya. doin now? becomes clear work perfectly, immunity fades, second infections worse, massive govt. debt dragging everything down, airlines closing permanently... crash comes. Hodl on. course people antisocial pattern high compliance people empathy pattern low compliance. Research like deals group averages. thought Santa coming Christmas..

New Zealand that’s geographically isolated, low population low population density? works simply won’t work larger countries.  accept deaths there’s nothing do.  accept people won’t follow mandates guidelines. don’t even blame governors lifting everything. mean hell supposed do? Wait kidnapped murdered patriots know masks lizard people win? people willfully spitefully ignorant measure affective. truly idea going end without either vaccine. /rant apples Noem?

Well, see, is. young people, wearing mask probably protecting people germs. I'm shopping, dicks see mask, mask nose, 40. Lots grey hairs.

Edit: put ""wearing mask probably protecting people germs"". know. love bringing wikipedia article. 99.9% survival rate would mean 1/1000 people would die it. Right U.S. roughly 230,000/9,000,000 died it. roughly 26/1000 people. Looks like never good math. anything probably Swiss really cold Ok, let's say there's fat cut, bill 100% miraculously making literally every single person cum rainbows. Well solution debating bill, passing back forth trough house Senate. 

Mitch debate it. never hit floor. 

Democrats released second, slimmer package. Voted House, passed Senate. 

Mitch debate it. never hit floor. 

Both sides? everyone responded me: thanks offering different viewpoint, like form adapt views based factors. agree authority major influence responsibility set good example, leaders - even authority figure acting one way ability choose otherwise! sides argument pretty silly one side magnitudes worse. problem is, end needed help get them. That's matters, no? conclusion makes sense. attribute every bubble ever rich people according reason nothing else money? hell dividends it, investor expects share price follow high dividend yields. would mean never buy Google example pay dividends.

Who upvotes bullshit? species chugged along fine, individuals died. Sturgis really helped. GOP would've impeached Hillary first 1000 deaths opportunity, look much make 4 people dying Benghazi equitable 9/11 long dont coordinate response give weight opinions chittering idiots US going continue fail response. Exactly. Even whole economy shitter, rich people still going want invest money, stock market rise.

Unless 1% country sell stocks hoard bitcoin... stock market stay up. problem closing locally possible people locked area travel non-lockedown areas spread virus. know story. shop Aachen really nice international section stuff can't get Germany.

They pretty nice ""wine month"" club too.

Fun fact, Walmart stores Quebec, Canada legalized right unionize province, like Germany. means ones fade 6-8 months US Italy cases December. February 21st likely hundreds thousands. game even knew playing it. don’t HR, also, it’s bad tbh. She’s still responsible wearing mask that. It’s way rationalizing. think everyone right now. actually good friend mine imagine care anyone one ever really cared republicans talking fiscally conservative party drove us massive debt. claiming stimulus expensive counter offer essentially worthless help.

Democrats position cave demands hold ground. concede much become party spineless cowards wont fight.


Only one party actively fighting giving aid citizens essentially calling leeches. isnt Democrats.

""If give single mom money feed kids become lazy"" It’s easy situation weighing consequences 40 million+ children ineffective education entire year, vs sometimes 0.4% mortality rate happen contract COVID, depending age/risk group (lower &lt;50, higher 50+)

I say double in-person teacher salaries (hazard pay), anyone risk group ability stay home handle virtual duties etc full regular pay. start think long term, there’s guarantee COVID cured, think year without education kids could manifest severely gruesome consequences. Consequences linger decades. 

COVID sucks. buy way Bro, subreddit. subreddit one extreme side coronavirus end world. extreme side called living life ignoring media stuff, every couple weeks so, that, “pandemic” doesn’t seem bad.

Now, reality know situation bad worrisome, point I’m making everyone reddit day reading negative news coronavirus. lot people don’t even friends friends friends impacted it, upset handled? supposed go seek negative media stories get sad say administration isn’t enough?

My girlfriend works ICU. floor packed again. Shit doubt 100% real worrisome, also understand people don’t see fuss about. said, might taken experiences universal. Looking back, early twenties felt far formative early teens. absolutely realize everyone's experience. 

And absolutely agree closing schools level (bar university-level, course) last resort. kids started distance learning March they're still it. Neither speech impediments permanent damage. grandparents alive though, that's good. can't imagine damaged they'd caught Covid-GOP school gave grandparents died. Probably missing school months.  speaking hyperbolically. didn’t think anyone would believe I‘d seriously suggest US bad North Korea. mistake. Sorry. Thanks that. Funny post styles exactly same. Sustained close contact heavy breathing masks still moderately risky outdoors. depends entirely much trust participants.  saying Nothing worse inherited 1%er won’t admit it. mean could wear masks though.... know won’t, but, like, could. They’re bad. 3 5 year old wear one day. Agreed. LOT people facebook saying done Nov. 4th. (I live South). hate dumbfucks. username checks out

hope sausage fest worth bro He's probably getting sick asked really surprising anyone. 

I Minnesota. 15 - 29 age range, 43k confirmed cases. cases, 4 deaths total. deaths many deaths, still .009% chance contracting dying COVID. lot people willing put prime lives hold something likely large impact health one way another.

There reason 18 year old dies makes front page news, time nursing homes ravaged longer considered news worthy. 

I saying right thing do, point pandemic understand frustration lockdown social isolation comes pandemic seeming like bigger deal getting virus. lol Yep, mom, dad, younger brother, live me, taking multiple precautions visiting sister Berkeley birthday, mom's getting tested go. reasons since we're living together, would rest us. Simple public health measures *strictly followed 95+% population*, recognize level adherence necessary never happen America. We've allowed covid get far ahead us now, measures helpful, impactful adopted earlier. hope get banned sub posting nonsense. Go sell lies somewhere else.

Actual title:


“The Covid-19 Crisis Fraud
According data, emergency! 
Please visit source verify yourself!” Yea keep testing it’ll never go away watch media? Go Twitter? movies? mainstream opinion leans far left idea you’re saying. 

You know happens someone get caught using racial slur society? Publicly state you’re voting Trump? support wall? 

You get destroyed, absolutely destroyed lose job. don’t know argue Trump garbage rhetoric winning popular opinion. know many people say seriously social distancing really aren't. They'll take masks around friends family live with, travel mini vacations people live with, take masks special events photos, indoor dining, ect.

They seem think anything less normally strictest. good acting like normal, there's still way do. I'm also thinking get hit much harder either, really knows. feel like US already sorta 'second wave', whereas Europe delayed second wave harsher lockdowns.

By means US clear, I'm hoping see type uptick Europe seeing right now, started much lower number cases, whereas US high sometime now. Europe probably 3-4 weeks ahead USA, optimistic. Democrats take control, happen another 8-9 weeks now.

So, 5 weeks main street economy going get clobbered again.

Reminder, NY city 16 confirmed cases March 9th, less 3 weeks later first $2 trillion stimulus bill passed. exponential growth you.

People going know blame cannot pay January 1st bills, 2 days Democrats take control win election. Edit: think US government hold another stimulus round 5 weeks.

I firmly believe Republicans want personally profit market collapse point... giving Senate hoping base forgets come midterms next Presidential election. Republican base already demonstrated doublethink scale thought fantasy modern age.

I think Democratic supermajority play, maybe Republicans would gone ahead stimulus. Maybe case, surprised people seem discovered economic hopelessness trigger mental health issues. almost if... poor bad? kills you?

Who would thought, seriously? Oh get ""both sides"" bullshit. There's one side sociopathically holding country hostage absolutely regard suffering causing... there's one side *not fucking that*. don’t think media capitalized this? bringing 

Ugh...Atlanta sports...I hope covid kills next. ♫♪ *I'm high hell get shot* ♬♫ electoral college brings balance country NY Chicago Cali cant controll country. Thank god. Tell me, deadly think virus kids exactly? live DU quite lot better that. Yes, imagine exactly that. can't nothing, situation France completely severely control, makes current US predicament look like cakewalk. also can't expect real longterm benefit this, think point idea lock hard essentially remove virus country totally debunked what's happening European nations. 

So yes, disaster like France right now, guess choice lock down, bring back level healthcare system completely pulverized, prepare butthole next inevitable surge.  thing again. waiting vaccine.  people aren’t going believe anything misguided opinions beliefs. also means we'll done :)  you’re telling majority population actually follow rules, wear masks social distance, didn’t need lockdown. Yet cases rising, even they’re supposed to, lockdown wrong thing? 

You’re insane. countries couldn’t pop adults follow directions listen advice. “lockdown” even they’re isn’t enough. you’re saying “lockdown fanatics” use information. one wants lockdown, fanatics you’re talking would rather people stay home couple weeks watch hospitals overrun. It’s called sociopath. That’s probably work doctors. Kids don’t walk pharmacy pick want. Wow actually huh Actually... youth turnout year record high. genuinely think Texas could turn blue year. coordinated american lockdown. varied state. PA, basically everything closed including schools. lasted 6-8 weeks slowly started opening everything back up. still restrictions crowds (as far know, I'm definitely trying kind crowd now) mask mandate. Restaurants half capacity now. idea enforcing restrictions nthough, all. Maybe business level individual level. 

Some states were/are loooot lax (bars never closed, still huge gatherings, mask mandates, etc.) 

Anyway, mess. Good luck all. hope lockdown least improves things country. think there's much hope us US. hotspots difference provinces.
But Belgium small. 3 regions different rules federal government trying make rules uniform. North Dakota 70,000 square miles population 760,000 people. Washington DC 68 square miles population 684,000. Guess whose positive rate 10 times worse other's? definitely falls Darwin Award territory. So, guess fight fight want to, covid deniers. rest us waiting say ""I told so"" ever get ICU. die I’m glad mentioned that. also remember seeing horrifying videos circulating jan/feb showing young healthy people collapsing choking street. 

I don’t care say virus, didn’t happen anywhere else world... purely propaganda. world terrified looked China see contained, course extremely harsh lockdowns. entire world destabilized lockdown train China’s economy thriving. fact spell out, it’ll met sharp criticism, means worked well. That's sole reason. Historically, French people pretty dissatisfied leaders, like time. can't compare US numbers Americans much easily satisfied. straight point summary US store. It’s rails we’re mercy evolution either reliable therapeutics vaccine realized. feel, though, I'm yet see anything resembling strong correlation strength-of-lockdown having-it-under-control.

Spain's incredibly tough. Covid's back.

France's tough. UK drones following people mountains stop hiking. Covid's back.

If argument sunbelt states done same, brief temporary reprieve, Covid return vengeance, think people would taken relative freedom summer.

Lockdowns work short term they're sustainable option.  first report came said killing black people disproportionate rate knew fucking trouble country.  almost contact tracing possible virus stabilished strategy early stages localized outbreaks used entire history humanity last 10 Years: 
Venezuela 
Bolivia 
Yemen
Libya 
Syria
Egypt 

2000 2010
Honduras
Iran
Iraq 
Yugoslavia 

More info here: Found guy doesn’t get joke. Also, immunity isn’t permanent, means catch again, chance dying time. probably counting cooperation actually got. Luleå Umeå chance? I've gotten odd look Luleå, ain't exactly commonplace. update represents 3,271 new cases 18 additional deaths. second-highest single-day case total, Saturday’s 3,338 cases


I understand WTF wrong people home state. like death wish. OH CAUSES BLINDNESS matter. coming close retirement pick asset class *least* risk, remains bonds. Technically cash would even lower risk, usually going pay penalty convert cash prematurely.

This sub full insane uninformed market speculation, read anything beyond that. guess living apartment compared house backyard, garden, maybe green house, like night day. old, alone stuck apartment must Hell. spouses great grandmother 91 like since may. says life worth living. end world WW2 end world. Learn math works look data. Idiot comment. Los Estados Unidos nos mandan su mejor gente. Ellos son infermos, son enojados, unos (supongo) son buena gente fuckin real. I’m sick tired it. People idiotic ways we’ll never get unless enough people drugged freedom assholes catch hopefully infecting innocents throughout

Controversial me, COVID deniers catch pass good riddance pretty much 100% bonds near retirement. THANK DR FAUCI! true american hero! God bless you!

This exactly *needs* **federal** law mandating masks **right fucking now**. Hopefully Biden/Harris make happen (assuming tRump doesn’t steal election again, major if) course. It’s first time took national hiatus pandemic awareness. 7,8 months, absolutely idea virus spreads. Fantastic. yeah, that's happening March.   
I Covid then, never got hospital b/c high-risk factors.   
  
It sucked, one day really think might see side it... kept hospital bed open someone breathe.    
  
I want downplay Covid though. Recovering longest toughest 5 months life. Borders EU Switzerland opened. Closed rest world except returning french citizens. Maybe record year profits attendance. market entertainment specialize prices go up. 

Not sure downvotes. I’m saying new normal good thing, humans may adjust.

I’m boomer, politician, anti-science, anti-vacs, anti-masker. trying realistic. Oh, it’s ok, sold back us stole it! “redistributing” Alien zombies. 550k infected 20 October convert American population. virus reach 100% lethality? They’ve already tested adults. won’t know children trusted enough decide whether sex buy beer can't agree part clinical trial.

How think develop meds children? Curse Randy Marsh! people would die result failed business worth less anyone else? Imagine older couple owns small restaurant, paying insurance, suddenly income? lose business, house, healthcare, lives. desperate people resorting measures. greed coming above, unless consider wanting able sustain ""greed."" They're literally prioritizing health life strangers. Maybe altruistic, everyone gung ho martyr. 

&amp;#x200B;

(side note: willing martyr this. sign participate [Human administer trial vaccines participants expose virus. Western PA understand that's possibility here. Looking write this.) test 3 days ago (positive) via nasal swab. area inside nose swab touched still extremely sore painful breathing hard. self administered maybe wrong went far- normal? Anyone else experience this? proves reduce infection rates keeping schools open. numbers right front you.

I live dude, parents teachers. schools falling apart matter want think.  That’s stupid. point lockdown stop spread, let virus die it, let everyone out. seen american liberals basically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives wrong.

Interestingly enough, replace 'coronavirus' 'muslims' see exact reverse taking place pandemic. 

It's something Sweden that's extremely polarizing americans, idea why. Fauci, WHO, CDC, Gates, et al ever said word Vitamin D? would good place start wait miraculous vaccine save us.

I know fine group experts (is Gates qualified expert?) care people's health find odd. missed something? Phew, thank God. worried things go back normal. Flu Mortality rates higher seasons influenza tends spread people, generally fall winter months seasonal strains... Occasionally Novel strain pop ""off season"" flu causes similar outbreaks summer spring, case point H1N1 Swine Flu popped spring 2009. socialism mean make 400k year, make less? misunderstood, mean long hospital stays (2 week plus) also ventilators. 4 went ventilators. One come 6 month long hospital stay. Trump list ending pandemic accomplishment presidency?

What fucking joke Get real, count. Large concert organizers planning anything 2022, give realistic expectation many states going really reopen. yep lot deaths happened region ( limburg) wave 1.

The worst regions 2nd wave didnt got hit hard.
So took less serious. socialism, people engineering degrees doctors make less money right? think folks want Covid politicized ones cool physical assault, mask mask. That's true, however 80% people mild case.

If someone knows handful people covid mild, that's going reinforce viewpoint covid nothing worse flu.

Sadly think it'll everybody knows someone (young/healthy) serious health issues Covid  Fucking seriously. there's one thing THOROUGHLY debunked past 6 months, idea anywhere close enough people going behave properly due ""personal responsibility"". There's lot things still sure pandemic. one them. Personal responsibility absolutely work. much correlation would expect IRF hospital/ICU occupancy % capacity? mean, overtaxed hospitals render poorer outcomes? Staff fatigue, equipment space shortages, oxygen medicine supply chains must figure mortality rates, right? Heavy breathing, close contact, would airborne virus. German government paying affected businesses 3/4 made last November businesses vastly reduced operating expenses like restaurants continue make small amount money deliveries. That's one, thanks Wish honest fault denouncing masks 6 months ago. feeling one coworkers positive. come office past week. office actively tries suppress cases prevent employees quarantining (in name patient privacy). do? want infect family unknowingly. get covid test? American news actually really spectacular. think problem lies biased ""commentators"" like someone give bit news 20 different people give opinion it. nice change I'd suggest take look ""Global news Canada"" good boring new anchors reading news Maybe dumb Q since haven’t paying attention France curious: would rate France handled first lockdown opening now? 

Did citizens wear masks? social distancing followed? Etc

Basically surprise France? Roughly 80k people died combined illnesses last year. That's shutdowns, mask wearing, social distancing. made concessions stop spread Covid death toll could several times higher is. easy lose sight bad history recent is. MLK shot ~50 years ago, that's well within lifetime. think much aggression opposition MLK civil rights activists faced, think everyone that's would've raised children. kind prediction abilities working wallstreet. There's nothing indicate weakened. Treatments gotten better though. IFR even CFR now.
It's IFR could be.

40M deaths lets say 50% population infected means IFR 24%. call improbable country healthcare system broke down.
But even SARS-CoV-2 way lover IFR, might secondary deaths due side-effects lockdown measures simply healthcare system broke down, death rates diseases accidents might go up.

But again, like worse case scenario. 

If we're lucky, we'll end way 1% IFR. goal zero, that's realistic (in Europe least, high population density connected network countries). goal keep manageable vaccine, arrive soon; likely last lockdown. small business already prepared. take genius know hermits want us live like Wall-e .... currently spraying house mouth wash... I, personally didn’t break it. choose move, come conclusion I, personally can’t fix it. problems deeply rooted. take several generations things realistically change. Right problem actually getting worse due negative stuff amplified Faux News echo chambers created social media. think Soeder said best: sooner take medicine, quicker get back normal life. think it, around 2 weeks behind France (and Belgium, Netherlands, EU countries) already put place lockdown.

It difficult decision, one makes sense No, younger people infected, deaths lag new cases, better treatment. Brain getting old No. kids going schools. Factories still working. Borders opened. nothing like first lockdown. 

Bars restaurants impacted. + hard teleworking dealing kids time Trump got, minimum, $100,000 free health care, including entire team specialists access experimental drugs rest us buy even death's door. Please, wake up. bot stupid looks keywords. scrapped months ago, refuse so, meaning mods need get replaced too. wild, start year sub said would see million dead ton people would call crazy say reacting like ""ya, sure million, 10's millions!""... personal attack either, agree terms numbers.  ""Low"" fucking high compareable countrys lockdown. anyone take account testing country?  pretty much. cure can't worse disease criticized talking point awhile. try shutting shit backlash surreal lol. People aren’t going lockdown ever again. Sure, masks + distancing easy follow (which do), end isn’t magic cure anything close. Protect risk, rest due diligence live life. 

PS: better getting sunlight exercising seeing friends don’t want anti depressants losing motivation deprived vitamin D. That’s equally bad healthy folks contracting Covid. Dont become recluse, that’s life works. safe also don’t lock away look worked out... states like CA gone crazy restrictions aren’t even significantly much better states lockdowns since May. Protect vulnerable, due diligence public areas. That’s literally it. layman's opinion: doubt it. fatality rate lowered because

a.) spring pretty much testing severe cases, meaning cases likely end death. Asymptomatic mild case numbers almost completely unknown.

b.) hitting older/more vulnerable population harder. better handle keeping nursing homes types places like now. spreading among younger people, less risk. yes, people getting tested. Obviously rise hospitalizations grave concern, fact testing many places, anyone get test want, symptoms symptoms.

c.) March, hospitals doctors, even ones overwhelmed, flying blind really knowing against. better treatment methods learn virus works affects--keeping patients prone, using anticoagulant medication prevent clotting, going straight putting patients ventilators, etc. real lockdown though, time schools remain open. good news immune system, also socialization etc.

The important remaining deleterious effect workers daycare wearing face mask, likely good learning speak. Yeah, unfortunately while. look Hard Hat riots Richard Nixon's support them. think we'll go back old normal? need sources claims. leave decisions elected officials. can’t mandate anything. Yep, luck keeps progressing past year, we'll see Influenza throw particularly nasty strain farm middle nowhere add mess...

Not saying that's likely happen, probable year, everything else 2020, surprising all... Answer: want paid full salary work. Like last school year. Working government nice.

True. took 200 first smallpox immunization created Edward Jenner 1796. took 200 years worldwide vaccination program eradicate disease. last known naturally occurring case smallpox diagnosed Oct. 26, 1977, Merka, Somalia, according CDC. World Health Organization (WHO) declared smallpox eradicated Lol good luck getting citizenship United states work together request Federal Executive. request never made. can’t say “they won’t work me” don’t ask. states rights argument March/April cop out. such, comment smallpox vials left lying around cardboard box. Viruses kill people humans do! fucking douchebag Oh goodness actually insane. Trolls put much effort Contact tracing key. Masks work lab, fail see works real world entirety europe wore masks since summer yet didnt anything look raw numbers. pharma fuckers better holding patent hostage make bucks. Course know got politicians wallets. five school-aged children died coronavirus, according Illinois Department Public Health (IDPH).

Well sucks. March early August, schools either operating entirely remotely closed summer break, 11,953 confirmed COVID-19 cases among Illinois children ages 5 17, 8,668 people tested positive deadly virus August 15, schools began reopen, October 2, state health officials told ProPublica Tribune. 

If assume 4 students (fewer 5) died, known 20,621 cases, mortality rate among school children 0.024%. mentioned, number infections likely higher, mortality rate likely lower.

Stay safe kids. indexes rank personal freedoms put US anywhere near top list free are. generous ranking I've seen puts us 15. generous ones put us closer middle pack far lower. Germany good plan coming first lockdown. problem August lul nobody took precautions _was_ free go concerts. _was_ free work. _was_ free watch movie. I've asked give up.

Do think that's unreasonable? No. matter fact, set rant fact OP said went bar time. Freedom freedom without restrictions, get that. asked stop working, stop certain types fun wear mask (all done) cannot described losing freedom though. Perhaps I'm crazy though. Blame democrats. Oh sorry, thinking IFR looking definitions. everyone gets infected though IFR approach CFR confused me. everyone gets diagnosed end matching.

By ""True CFR"" guess meant IFR. We’re relocating job Australia. Supposed move back March put travel restrictions finally got exemption move 18th November. feel bad friends family stuck winter. Makes feel lucky extremely guilty. bonne...

bonne chance Excess mortality indicates otherwise. Belgium, France, Sweden substantially excess deaths covid deaths. 4 weeks lockdown schools still open useless self inflicted pain told summer Europe Right™ US locked harder thing would now...

You live learn. It’s still 5 percent. That’s still good odds. talking about? protesting covid measures: work well since July. Look logaritmic scale! Half country lives paycheck paycheck $500 savings, we're colossal unemployment numbers rampant wealth inequality growing faster every day. There's riots streets continual state brutality. mention literal virus running like wildfire country. live next ever growing tent city due it. Yeah guess right, pretty chill

Let's replace P word ""State"" see gets removed Thats exactly dudes point lmao bad. Strict national lockdown. months before. Months turn years. everyone going take vaccine. wear mask whenever I’m around people also went bars summer New Jersey hit hard. can’t lock people houses expect go away. I’m trying start argument make political. think something learn live get [El Paso aware that’s there’s difference socialism communism no? Home prices soar......two weeks later..prices back down. Canada. People got money needed live. Confrontations daily? considered makes pretty clear you’re problem? 

Most people encounter don’t give af politics covid. Shit what’s front us. Working home heavily recommended government said companies make utmost effort helping people switch WFH sectors Literally nothing mentioned politics specifically Idiocracy happens. since whole World shutdown may well roll ""Great Reset"" right ? Seems like good time really fuck people. beginning lil plague here. beginning complete change everything. emigrated US decade ago particularly valuable trade skills. difficult. learned local language arriving. Took 4 years get long term residency visa, 3 years get permanent residency.

Some countries, like Korea, get foot door literally nothing except 4 year degree English speaking country. Even something useless like gender studies degree. betting long-term issues become permanent issues? seems like resolving 3 - 5 months so. called basic human decency. We’re already seeing significantly cases coming hospital week week. Please people, take seriously, we’re still exhausted last wave. 

Wear masks, social distance, practice good hygiene, avoid gatherings. Give shit families, neighbors, communities. it, win. could easy accomplish. Please. Good. Medical staff strike benefit. one looking them. idea protecting essential workers disappeared. make dramatic like /u/haiasnnssksksksnwn aware erupt. actually look link. google version I'm feeling lucky. hate. remember skies Mt St Helen's, I'm aware eruptions do, also fear Pompei happens hope find wife get covered lava lol announce lockdowns advance give small businesses chance prepare inevitable loss revenue   That's fair argument gray area. empathize since I'm similar boat. black white I'm getting it.

Which exactly concern... there’s plenty gray reasonable everything back way it’s delivered makes real easy read isolation long time come people aren’t going handle. say?  citizen rest world, please no. Thank you. That's ""lockdown"" though get hard paywall here. Lol chill.

I'm meeting people work get beers. person said society resembles normal society. adding clarification Fauci saying. stuff used pre-covid, feels different. Fauci saying feel like pre covid years. ppl mixture anti-vaxxers, right wing extremists, conspiracy theorists science deniers. way representative broader population livelihoods, hating govt lots reasons. people normal people call socializable, means would want seen them.

I know lot people work hospitality see one disagreeing measures. Friend mine owns hotel. prefers lockdown state money instead going broke one coming. totally gets need fix virus situation order fix climate business.

Btw govt guarantee 75% revenues before, sensible govt banana republic. Workers still get furlough, basically extended end 2021. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  isn't. people like brag wearing mesh masks grocery stores. Look guy's post history. That's apparent contradiction Fauci then? Or, stimulus package. Like rest developed world done. Rapid testing there, much need. Testing basically best way contain things right now. word “lockdown” seems different meanings six months ago. Pfizer vaccine difficult produce distribute. good Intial vaccination health care workers though. Damn wish Australian. 

I’m UK like U.S it’s complete utter cesspit minute, countries goverened complete bozos.

Closing borders seems aggresive logical kinda like that. Ahhhh logic. 

I’m sure read guys aren’t even recession despite taking sizeable hit GDP.

Edit: Uk could definitley use guys model island yes country dense regarding population still alot managable 325 million. Lmao haven’t even checked. numbers bad week? much tourism going right now. Cases rising steadily still, although slower places Europe. US trend hit 100k 3 weeks. expect see states clamping bit end November, earlier. also remember seeing horrifying videos circulating jan/feb showing young healthy people collapsing choking street.

Can link these? know see comments, right? removed speculative first time continue removed. find pretty amazing come far quickly. Medicine typically never moves fast. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Failed I'm tired winning. Well, attitude 😂 masks almost certainly better masks everything else stays same. Sweden taking measures proven scientifically, studies published supporting mask wearing thus far I’ve heard one published coming week. hopefully people forced wear masks soon

There plenty studies suggest effectiveness. understand people still claiming none, e.g.: time, scientific studies slow time consuming. every country wait scientific studies absolutely prove measures effective, there's way deal fast-evolving situations. That's say ignore science (not all) think feet err side caution making educated guesses based existing scientific understanding pandemics managed.

It paid many Asian countries European American countries still debating whether acknowledge disease mitigation measures. Personally, feel whole ""there's scientific basis"" thing excuse inaction. Republican-controlled senate chose adjourn election, course shoving 2-years experience radical zealot judge throats. stimulus. fuck democrats supposed do, hello? Sick seeing “both sides” bullshit people. Republicans evil slime voted out. Holding Thanksgiving outdoors proper social distancing really lowers risk.

And think mental health benefits seeing people person occasionally. - New cases: 78,661
- Positivity rate: 7.4% (+0.5)
- hospital: 45,045 (+833)
- ICU: 9,034 (+125)
- New deaths: 1,025
- Data: COVID Tracking Project bet won’t get real answer that, long time. it’s low, people won’t take it. government ONE job can't handle time change. I’ve read comments make sure I’m crazy. 
If locking country, keeping people going work school... actually lock down? 
While suggesting welding people’s doors shut, perhaps slightly higher level actual shut order? 
Would kill legally mandate WFH office workers telework force children engage remote learning? 

At least case (USA, public education) 2020 school year’s program pretty decent thus far; lacking emotional growth due lack F2F interaction kids, basic “book work” going well.  fuckin' kidding. like two months nothing Christmas chaos grocery store. People would come beer section fuckin' socialize. business livelihood, aren’t thinking money only. thinking lives families. 

You can’t shout “greed” someone trying feed kids make ends meet.  New data comes every week. says change every week. That's life scientist civil servant. Apt description America hold breath, I'm holding mine. Even guidelines issued US Government back May? so, Georgia flat ignored opened anyhow meeting metric. really tiny goldfish brains. It’s like never remember dem pulls pile shit &amp; hose off. Boy! love pile shit! Well, hear we've beaten pandemic... what's worry? /s STATE authority, Federal government. Reddit likes idea high number people socially isolate anyways. kinda worried people taking it.

If vaccine efficient - matter, take enjoy immunity take vaccine battle virus without additional protection.

If vaccine efficient - matter, significantly alter chances getting sick and/or passing virus others, may well take it. exist yet, eventually discredit put tinfoil hats. Great great mindset  getting realize know friends out-of-household family, doesn’t mean it’s safe dinner drinks. Well, cases increase Sundays Sweden, know do.

But get light beers/cider every day super markets, right?

Yeah, people weird. I'm fatigued pandemic, all. could indefinitely lol.   cases already started rising France Europe generally. 

Hell, France's increase started months ago. need whine sad minute. baby September 2019 Korea live. plan go spend November, December, January family US. Obviously that's happening I'm coping reality 5 vacation days use go back work. short trip 2 young kids, still worth it, enough time really enjoy it.

I'm glad I'm person thinking this, I'm also concerned I'm person thinking this. would avoid chance dying 3% kids need go school let adults work home? telework possible kids home? Nah aren’t even disciplined wear mask go eat less frequently, let alone run difficult marathon routes world. lean toward stop spread virus, I'm open people's stories. go work go much. drove passed bar, bunch cars there. frustrating many people care. tell people people know gotten sick died usually get blank stares. say dont know anybody gotten yet. think lot room improvement. R0 1 infection numbers peaked already infection numbers start trending immediately. Hospitalizations deaths peak next 2 weeks. Eat healthy diet. Damn, that's crazy. can't imagine waking news like that. Still, think almost gift alive was.

You know, aside heightened racial tensions segregation become deadlier regards ability virus kill infects, it'll kill people better conditions virus spread among people generally exist colder months... people get infected part infect others means people die it, especially explosive outbreak occurs hospitals overwhelmed. Even people took seriously originally fatigued care anymore.

Not true. They're fatigued many people ignoring it, given educating helping others. They're trying survive lose anyone love.

They care, realized can't save everyone, even people. country. So, looking data comes EU seems be? Shouldn’t make EUA quicker process wait till reach certain milestones? kill.

It killed bunch already, kill 130,000 more. basically half assed lockdown.

Yeah, wonder things halves would achieve. expensive ineffective. EU need coherent strategy. Bummer! No, didn't. said lockdown last resource used flatten curve population completely control.  Historically building standard insulation terrible Australia. aware winter, less summer. doesn’t also mean ample time prepare first wave... didn’t? Nah bro every small business can’t curbside everything obviously wants people die close. live Manhattan Harlem. 🙋‍♂️ densest part city. lowest death rate far. idea cramped spaces magically increases death toll bullshit. means social distancing, doing.

Also, per capita death rate many times similar comparable countries, makes sense compare countries blindsided implement mitigations effectively. definitely stop virus spreading. number countries done exactly that. takes good leadership, cooperation, determination. What? Pfizer stated believe efficacy data available november 15th, able apply based FDA 2 month requirement:


Albert Bourla(Pfizer ceo) stated:
""And happens third week November, likely because, said, expect get soon. days end October, days end October. happens November 15, announce November Ha. curious Asian countries seem spectacular success controlling pandemic. much mask friendly culture, think greater sense collective responsibility, maybe take better care elderly. Even still really strange well they've done vs. Europe US. Considering President lies time opens mouth, yes. trust anyone him. Nah, fuck that, done us much us. Washington, supposed notably cold winter. I'm already run heat day. turn heat on, lose 5° within hour shuts end cycle. Combining many people hurting financially, going pretty. Oof. ask inhabitants want close retirement homes imo. dont think fair lock away elderly wishes better numbers feel better enjoying freedoms.

I feel way make situation better them. instance, let family visit plastic screen elderly visitors. say lockdown. 

From ""Avoid crowded indoor settings"", ""Meet people outside"", ""Outbreaks reported restaurants, choir practices, fitness classes, nightclubs, offices places worship people gathered, often crowded indoor settings talk loudly, shout, breathe heavily sing"", ""Regularly thoroughly clean hands"", ""Clean disinfect surfaces frequently especially regularly touched,"" Blindness result heart beating anymore 6PM news whilst dinner common time tbh, dumb face always comes onto segment somewhere 15 million furry fucks go hell think much racism nationalism here, fear going disappointed discover much places. I’m legit curious. dems right though? honestly don’t believe power anything.. all. system fucking flawed

Please give hope hold to.. literally contradicted yourself. right, won’t on/off switch like dimmer. We’ll start see effects, though subtle, soon first vaccinated groups reach point immunity. probably won’t even realize it’s happening first, numbers start go down. 

If people start getting shots early January, likely start seeing results late February. Home Christmas? I’ve heard one high risk person, self quarantine avoid public spaces give higher risk contracting virus. Quarantining healthy people risk virus doesn’t anything ends entire society people (mainly working class people) aren’t risk virus stay locked houses deal negative effects lockdown hurt families COVID ever would. Thank you! wish could repeat verbatim every freaking time see question asked. point almost 4 year old child understands explain it. sucks right now, doubt. frustrating see questions asked scientific answers given pushed aside whatever one “feels right”. Apparently need 32 according another article, aren’t yet. don’t. 

They spread 4-5 major cities means almost 6 million people per city. 

Whereas US many major cities account fraction population many people living beyond cities. 

I understand relative population density Australia.

Basically put...the middle country fucking empty haha. ranch needs helicopter road goes straight nearly 100 miles shows relative ease. totally sympathetic people struggling Covid measures. also believe virus spread point overloading healthcare, death rate become lot higher 1%. 

I've said before: Covid wrecked world particularly deadly, occupies terrible ""sweet spot"", mild enough people ignore precautions almost always OK, serious enough everyone ignored precautions consequences would absolutely disastrous. allowed virus take lives ruin lives, also maximally divisive society. Sure it’s underlying issue? fair, per capita guys better Europe rn Wisconsin. It’s shit show seen many without masks. Wtf?  son school past 2 weeks isolating. currently chills low fever runny nose. Going covid test tomorrow. 
Plus 50 yo cousin mn died sleep last night. Today test result came back positive covid Good Oregon! They’re great I’m betting Dr. Fauci 

I say 2023-24 I’m joking real solutions contact tracing, mask mandates, targeted enforced lockdowns along quarantine orders needed. Like China, Australia, New Zealand done. also requires public welfare support help people job losses.

China already seen economy improve.

The reason slow long burning job killing pseudo lockdown one wants enforce anything sentlate unwilling provide ongoing long term unemployment support beyond one time payout expired jobless benes. shit PPP program. Oh mcconnell wanted ram supreme court pick called recess. didn’t see coming still work office I'm one wears mask. I've accosted ""fellow"" coworkers makes feel uncomfortable. wear one anyway. 

I decided feel bad non-mask wearer office suddenly permanent day off.
If done everything gotten sick. I'm terribly sorry. 

If free balling situations be? 

You get ventilator intensive treatment. school extremely important little kids, they’re cutting risk many different places possibly keep shutting schools. I'll take look, they've incredibly hard find. sub censor &lt;redacted since reddit keeps deleting mention never found YouTube search, even links videos started going ""18+ only"" private. fucking annoying.

Edit: found one. screaming doctor 1:15 

Edit 2: reddit deleted original comment linking quarantined sub. fucking ridiculous guess district lucky case them.

Full disclosure, I'm closing schools. I'm explaining real impact education small amount students. without Internet accessing computer. everyone wants vaccine really thinks states regulate helmet must DOT approved. know Oregon State Troopers pull people ticketed helmet wearers repainted helmet covered DOT approval. reasoning, ""If can't demonstrate helmet DOT approved pulled over, can't know is."" Oregon pretty strict helmet laws overall. guy poster child selfish, entitled people think funny game played. Crazy overreaction dude. know it’s Reddit, take breath. 

Just clear, I’m talking programs paid (and continue pay) millions people either unemployed reduced employment. gone monthly whole time, aren’t mutually exclusive state programs ran concurrently (and IIRC cases generous federal program). seem think Australians spaced evenly across continent, instead concentrated handful capital cities. even weren't, plenty countries Asia incredibly dense cities controlled virus staying relatively open.

The irony Australians view socially culturally independent, sometimes compared Americans way. However, Covid lockdown Melbourne shown that, assuming advice logical civic good, vast majority Australians follow it. willing wear masks stay home 23 hours day, also literally close borders states keep virus in, neighboring states picked slack. can't imagine American state that. Google Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine looking promising, (very unsubstantiated) rumours British press rollout frontline workers may start ""week commencing 2nd November"". 

Could odd rumour-mongering, reported weirdly specific. Yeah, must think take almost measures flu, distance, masks, testing tracing, etc. real measure people get flu shot every year that's disease.  I'm burning masks shit over. think remember seeing PA threads. Let's throw one big Pennsylvania party It’s necessarily safer, present person much important kids learn adults office work. \^This. 

It's dumb. politicization vaccines control, parties responsible. First, Trump overpromising guarantees, political opponents stoking fear saying take unless approved scientists doctors. hell think conducting trials, reviewing results, ultimately (hopefully), approving them? certainly Trump. saying know many getting tested regularly even Massachusetts testing free widely available. younger population large still going business much changed. think spreading amongst said younger population largely symptoms akin bad seasonal allergies get pushed side versus serious cases older adults require hospitalization Haha nice God willing! plan eventually implement Great Reset seems summer help things, probably wont notably better past summer.

According German government, vaccine become available general public ""mid 2021"" (which could easily stretched mean September October). rate, we'll lucky even avoid another round winter lockdowns next year. decides rational POV is? Everyone rational point view. Hitler thought rational. Kevin Durant

Show study lingering effects damaging quality life people low risk category.

Do know probability works? thoughts exactly. Given things worked masks, worried people.. obviously worried me.. so.. vein please, I'm ready. shitty journalism without sort fact-checking. seems use date death rather date reporting, always result much lower number reality due lag reporting.

For record, actual number daily deaths (7 day rolling average) around 2-3 rising, falling. look situation US totally flabbergasted. feel sorry American neighbours - unbelievable US allowed get position.

I reread post made 3 months ago subreddit. contrasted Canadian province similar-sized US province. 

In July 2900 total cases, 200 total deaths one day 17 people hospitilized reported 9 new cases. sister state reported 50K+ total cases, 700+ total deaths day 2000 new cases.

Today 13,588 total cases, 259 total deaths, 217 new cases 3 new deaths last 7 days. 84 people hospital 27 ICU. fully open since June. Restaurants indoor dining, offices employees usually 2-3 days week person work schools back session since September. rules common-sense science based. pain impacted planning respect others anything need want do. partner slight cough headache last night. got test morning (free) results tonight/tomorrow morning. nurse apologized might take tomorrow spike last month.

By comparison sister-state 173,491 cases, 3,876 deaths, 912 new cases yesterday 34 new deaths ONE DAY. cannot imagine pain suffering.

&amp;#x200B;

I also cannot understand lockdown talk hear US. guess epidemic control way get control. one talking lockdown here. may close restaurants indoor dining certain areas needed adjust things like schools capacities one expects lockdown. would mean FB Twitter taking responsibility, like real legal responsibility, content. loathe opens regulation managed avoid lobbying legal games. took long, made right call. Mad respect Europe. feel like real estate general take huge pause Yeah got base referring America. Lived Asia 13 years. Move back year half ago. definitely places Asia would rather all. Stay safe. bot takes offense point group produced persuasion. Appropriate move even though think bring unrest people go second lockdown. There's risk going anywhere public though, assume already this. normally not. Calling right now, kind lockdown till January least. 
We can't possibly open country December Christmas NYE coming. Oh shit! *shuts society* it’s dangerous shops restaurants kids crowded together school? wanna lock someone wearing certain piece clothing face, asshats?!? Yup. repeated thing I've read local health departments across country current wave infections largely driven small gatherings among close-knit people. that.

13,000.42/sq mi &amp; 11,226/sq mi, close other.

But anything like area Vancouver, suburbs main driving force numbers wearing masks unlike people cities. Even then, know people abso-fucking-lutley taking vaccine democratic hoax. I’ve forced go wedding 75

Unless infant forced go anything  know it, boss knows it, everybody knows it. Dude. worth fight wife jfc. needs facts say want true Guys go away one day, rounding curve, dont let dominate lives.  /s I'd say that's fair assessment. don’t go nothing. definitely need allow people large parties order allow people meet groups 2-4.

As needing human contact, hard people go large amounts time without seeing anyone person. is. Maybe isn’t hard you, fine. hard many, led real mental health challenges.

Now, say restrictions aren’t necessary. are! However, backed evidence efficacy. Small, outdoor, masked gatherings problem. Imagine high risk. feel things, added fear another statistic. *his* convenience. “Investigating”

Here’s investigation:

Was field fucking camera touching people holding trophy testing positive. Ok was?

Investigation closed. crazy live world people attack public health director trying save people's lives. lot complaining Newsome’s heavy-handed approach, data makes seem like it’s working. Relatively speaking, course. literally means, per quote, doctor told likely France's first confirmed COVID case admitted December 27th.

That false. 

Here hospital saying found case mid november.

http://www.fondation-diaconat.fr/images/Presse/2020/CP-HAS-Imagerie-mdicale-7-mai-2020.pdf might done past, past done you. Hahahahahahahahaahahaha... know right. That's rich coming Dutch person. Every policymaker point trying keep boat afloat even means bailing madly another 6 months whatever. Eventually ship going down. literally people openly acknowledging debts never repaid.  Legally parents give consent, child must assent well take part. Care taken make sure child actually making decision own, rather coerced it. Ah Americans definitely dumbest people earth culturally forbidden US. Asia they'll call fat fuck reservations. take piss, think Scotland place get holiday year. Please lete in... Depression 3..2..1..

I'm starting think 2021 miserable 2020. Aerospace industry predicting even recover 2024. Vaccine Companies predict mid-end 2021, let's honest, even healthcare workers optimistic comes getting successful vaccination lasts long enough good enough immunity rate. I’ve noticed lots picture politicians wearing mask nose, like people make major decisions rest us stock bubble housing bubble now? prevents wealthy people investing real estate instead, literally anything stocks? wealthy, also majority real estate wealth general. could invest, to? Don’t worry, European countries going lockdown fearmonger US voters influence election. November 3rd passed, they’ll open back case numbers magically drop overnight. /s say let them. Fucking natural selection point. country proven many stupid people are. take blessing disguise? know lot innocent lives lost this, thing happens war. Let stupid decide fate. Putting teammates risk Covid myocarditis, could sideline them, ***unable even train*** year, mention cancer-surviving immunosuppressed trainer — reprehensible.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Cases already rise US again. 7 day moving average worldometers 72,000 day 35,000 cases day back mid September. rise Europe also US. recently 81,000 cases 23rd october highest we've had. sure much higher it'll go think seeing rise well Yup secondary infections brutal thats one reasons lot hospitalized covid patients pneumonia put prophylactic antibiotics.

Its sucky even advancements medicine epidemiology particular still looking scenario far away 1918. Back medical community flying blind obstructed. Though anti-mask idiots thing backbthen finedbinstead kf empowered. Plenty addicts hide addictions loved ones. meetings moved Zoom, stop attending avoid overheard caught families. Others finally tell families truth, always met love support. Relapses, overdoses, domestic violence, divorce, suicides follow this.

For reason, meetings seen medical care. absolutely need prioritized way. Let Fauci find way support businesses shut down. curve flattened. graph shows one wave. wave can't end higher started. appreciate view world different lenses, get that. decisions making question values beliefs. sees pandemic inconvenience something go around. always said throws money problems. see behavior selfish disregard people. 

(she family taken several vacations pandemic. many friends bailed group get togethers, her.)  Ddi read title? already fitness club declared church cafe enters short-term work contract every customer. Several restaurants city also started offer rooms rent qualify hotels.

I would laugh talking covid-19 Juarez. know Carlsbad Artesia New Mexico also employ people Juarez - they'll come Monday go home Friday spend weekend families. border closes people can't come jobs work employers left scrambling replacements. Knowing humans can't choose coexist viruses mean solution. Vaccines also huge profit-makers like prescription drugs are. moved Houston couple months ago California. I’ve forced go wedding 75 people HOUSE maybe 2800sqft, family camping trip 50 people smoking weed (they literally sharing pipes), let’s forget fucking PUMPKIN PATCH wife bring daughter thousands people long ass line covid gauntlet hay bails put people roller coaster-type line literally 1ft away other. even tractor pull running FULL kids. one wearing masks events. don’t go I’m inconsiderate asshole, don’t let daughter hug kiss everyone, I’m asshole. place lose lose situation. 

Long story short. We’re fucked. Twist: actually referring Trump 

/s Exactly. federal government, support lockdown would this. point wrong feel like things trending wholly negative direction shouldn’t expecting 2021 much better 2020? Ah yes good old discrimination solve everything! Actually, teen child deaths remarkably low. article discusses issue wanted say picked puns, even though guy didn’t. 👍🏼 It’s cruel irony. single day report cases doses Regeneron available. Someone needs tell Trump's base believing truth experts instead, digesting lies told Trump events become super spreaders!🤦‍♂️💔🚷🚑 Yeah, timeline sounds realistic line experts I've heard talk it. I'm planning restart social life next September. Obviously may change information changes, seems realistic point. dunno, told people wear type mask work, people listened. sucks honestly seem like funny guy comments depression really comes hard. Try make everyone else depressed Sorry, I'm young enough consider Carter recent :/ States can't run negative budget. States collect taxes function. States like FL TX rely states open. Unless federal government says cover states expenditures, remain open. Plain Simple. Debt matter state levels. Wow, diagnosed influenza well? Hope family gets well soon. reminds motorcycle helmets. states require helmets, you’ll see people riding plastic “low-profile” shells offer zero protection DOT Snell approved. We’re ticking box, people  Homeschooled kids often homeschooled parents choice. want kids homeschooled make sure learn want kids learned. first lockdown France, many children left homework two months, summer vacation. parents (no time, ressources, background themselves) help kids keep studying.

For kids already behind, becoming close point non return. Covid endemic, like flu.

So might well stop living fear, live life normal.  believe work hard, dying living miserable conditions fine? sound better every human basic, livable standard.

Also note even took pay cut, still making vastly almost entire country. Covid's back large scale *months* later - that's what's important. that's months fairly poor response following lockdown.

The strength lockdown what's important cut immediate numbers - look rate cases Europe vs US, impact pretty easily visible. 

What *should* done strong lockdown start 2-4 weeks, government stepping guarantee wages + rent/mortgage payments allow people get by. time, set better testing tracking capability prevent uncontrolled spread lockdown ended.

As relative freedom summer, countries lockdown Europe far US, IMO - relatively normal enough issues traveling around normal, unlike spread here. Obviously part issue Europe - taking strong enough measures period. gone Easter. Easter, idea! Trump received drug, REGN-COV2, arguably gamechanger him. put dexamethasone, given sick patients. People age 20-30% dying even dexamethasone, sick enough hospitalized need dexamethasone alleviate symptoms.

Trump even given largest dose REGN-COV2, done normal circumstances shortage doses.

Nevertheless, report shows diminishing returns benefits dosing lower range given trial, means doses available public.

Now Trump government, Republican enablers, botched COVID-19 response thoroughly, unfortunately going far antibody treatments available public material affect effects crisis. Since April, little doubt scientific community antibody treatments could effective. thrive fall winter.. weve experienced COVID ""good"" seasons far...and people it. doomed, nothing new imo.

I live Phoenix. good. mild winter .....oh wait, conservative snowbirds start flocking back winter Midwest east coast....fuckkk  Yeah. That, literally, mean COVID.

France's first confirmed COVID case admitted December 27th. Genetic material found sewage November Italy France mean outbreak time. Yep, 2020 year spread, 2021 year vaccination, late 2021/ early 2022 probably back complete normalcy, obviously many large concerts winter months, spring/summer 2022 concerts back probably. clinical trial child parent must give informed consent care taken make sure child truly consenting well.

The ethics clinical trials major concern throughout world results unethical trials can’t used approval. Maybe religion added list describe sound similar Sweden experiencing though, lesser extent. 80% gyms, cinemas, hairdressers etc closed. government specifically ordered though recomendations made people wanna go there.

The biggest difference seems schools. schools children 16 went distance learning Sweden. 

Was closing hairdressers etc ordered government, punishment etc didnt follow said? Pretty damn depressing thing allowed go work go school. 

This life regardless coronavirus. many people I'm sure. world seen anything close lockdown short effective enough? 

Heck, would even enough considering incubation + contagion time single round spread? Basketball close contact sport get. outside better. wisdom takes 15 minutes sustained contact someone become infected (ie, conversation).

But it’s decision weigh you, friends, people live with. Nobody really give accurate answer State officials taking Covid seriously people take seriously going lower rate. new virus, don’t know long complications last recovery, much less whether people mild symptoms experience them. information moment theoretically possible groups experience long-term symptoms, many people group experiencing symptoms recovery. (If case, would news would make scary story.)

A minority children (again, death rate less 1%) may face trauma family member’s death, portion minority might feel way responsible.

There guarantee vaccine, although reasonable optimism. However, don’t know long distribution take, time frame indefinite right now. people asked sacrifice children’s development maybe another year more. you’re right, peers going thing, means generation kids social, emotional, academic gaps. pandemic definition ended long time ago.

Pandemics go death count, case count. Ah yes, makes sense. see you’re ignorant. Religion that, makes mind weak you’re used thinking own.  Based profile, he’s projecting. probably get approved January. take 6 months manufacture distribute enough US gain herd immunity. expect go away July. Biden wins senate flips blue, allowing laws written making vaccine free. aca gets kicked Supreme Court, Trump reelected senate stays red. vaccine going cost $300 per does, ain't way 231 million Americans/insurance companies going shell kind money get us herd immunity.

Blue Cross Blue shield Arizona pays testing covid related treatment . Haha matter. Maybe 10 states (Cali, NJ, NY, MS, etc.) it. state will. Taxes work differently different states. example Cali NY get bunch tax revenue income tax states like TX FL get sales tax. Closing everything completely removes source income, happen. Yeah, promise it’ll happen one day, they’ll best results boss ever seen, performance would never believe nearly bad financial assistance sent. can't take away someone's right work certain jobs compensate that. complete utter failure levels government. actresses Alyssa Milano Lena Dunham, lead singer Tool, various athletes heart issues. 

But none anyone would describe serious. Alyssa Milano hair issues. Keenan cough. Lena unspecified ""lingering sure more, ones know of. celebrities might want publicize it.

Oh right. celebrity get weird effects Covid wouldnt want tell people it?

None people know tested positive lingering issues. 75 year old uncle got Covid fine. None personalities city Covid lingering issues.

It's interesting get impression common serious effects reality.

I think news give impression much common actually are. answer? keep locking countries get level 10 deaths day? 0? anyone given exit plan, even plan?

Looks like one big race make yearly vaccine generate massive amounts know I've definitely noticed get used time. suppose depends definition Armageddon. estimates place total deaths upward 500k. reference makes deadlier WW2 US.

By time over, likely deadly WW1, WW2, Vietnam combined.

And large share solely due Trump's ineptitude. Democratic house already passed Brown virus relief May. Since Democrats control halfway branch government else expect do? Let's pretend sides oh, gop-controlled Senate able rush unqualified candidate Supreme Court bench. able take coronavirus relief 5 months? know governor lt governor are? Lt Dan said, near beginning elderly sacrifice economy. 

Abbott heavily financed big oil getting murdered fact one driving around. So, yea, people run state interest citizens mind all. even remotely said. Try again.  already policing place enforce restrictions specific types outdoor activities understand, don’t need restrict everything could possibly hope vaccine close?

You completely wrong end stick. Informed consent children involves getting consent child parents. amount consent child depend age maturity child extra care taken vulnerable population.

A 12 year old probably wouldn’t decision consent consent challenged generally old mature enough. Several vaccines work reckon could vaccine early next year. things may better next summer understand real, threat virus goes around every year. like this:

Kids go school normally, students 15 years homeschooling. someone right equip he/she either gets school that's possible stay classroom participate class there.

I mean never gonna great times certainly better like right now. High risk people example get fucked moment can't go school way participate class online. one cares them... What's happening Nov 11th? disappear November 4th

#/S Bless. first line defense prevent infected persons entering house, especially asymptomatics! UV lamps used sanitize surfaces, especially commercial settings lot turnover patrons using high-touch surfaces (like airplane public restroom train station). Ideally office space want medical grade high-filtration system, buildings equipped kind HVAC ductwork &amp; units. super costly install. little inflation bonds pay 0, cash safer bonds yields same. days bonds safe hedges equities over.

Bonds pay 0. keep saying without merit. evidence? kind support government give businesses forced close? One thing never understand Western countries. fuck piece fabric hard wear? Yes, I've heard dumb excuses...omg, kids know emotions blah blah. Like Germans good showing anyway lol. -\_- One point postpone hospital handle cases vaccine developed.
Beating twice means kept control. cases appeared managed them. can’t say New Zealand doesn’t control.

And think majority idiots, lot government scared needs done. touched personally.

&amp;#x200B;

Give time, will. ............PCR cycles? Dare ask? hope not. Merely ""free"" promised.  Worse disaster elderly care facilities early pandemic. really worse got controll, doesn’t matter many times explained sub. People keep screaming lungs Sweden murders it’s people herd immunity strategy drives nuts though people realize letting get control, people going die, everything want ""normal"" going take much longer get back to? 


Seriously, 1-3 years however many freaking years, there's going like zero restaurants/bars/stores/theatres/entertainment whatever still business besides giant corporations, amazon, fast food.  


Welcome suck. good enough evidence published hospital reported widely good enough sub. disagree comment dont abuse mod privileges.

Similarly multiple athletes told doctors likely Covid October possible say so, especially qualify word, **presumably**. Well nature methods dealing overpopulation, like pandemics example. saying I'm cheering death, population reduction goal, situation exactly bad think overpopulation problem. Right, get pay twice? want hear story concerned horrible person? That's better thought would be. Well clearly countries Europe keep them, would stretch US same.

Plus, open, fuck students wearing masks even windows open? ridiculous. Korea, students wearing masks day teacher well. ""Surely,"" said myself, ""we need flag word 'testicles'"" forum virus."" Yet are. least people get see one last Christmas. Lol america deserves it. Surge capacity ITU UK publicly available marked ""official sensitive"".

Even within NHS need quite high see national picture. exist vacuum, people witness devastating effects wrote it. That's know existed first place! fact 3 weeks ago, cases 2000 makes worry this. 2 weeks ago, 5000. fatality current cases another two three weeks? Look, I'm anti-Trump come, certainly fumbled whole thing like bunch idtiots...

But could control? Even countries strict lockdowns facing resurgence.

It's fucked I'm thinking way, I'm glad kind got enjoy summer... Hopefully, that's gives shots too. :) heads people, AIER organisation responsible Great Barrington Declaration. Lmao already tried that, bub. Let’s close country though make things even worse think I’ve done least dozen things far today alone worse environment every single disposable mask I’ll use throughout entire pandemic.

If wasn’t fact don’t children would one man environmental holocaust. get steal environmental impact descendants would caused. don’t feel bad them, I’m indication would assholes too!  said ""right now"" reference new cases. live dfw. it’s goon, wear mask. Yes NI Wales national lockdown, locals month(s) ago. local lockdkwn 5 weeks national. clearly know nothing Australian culture. Hmmm, no. Thanks playing.  No, meant. meant, even pay $50 injection nothing vaccine itself, 300 million government paid it, still come somewhere. Ok, zoomer. Hun, babe, sweetie, please turn brain.

If everyone stayed inside 4-6 weeks, allowing current infections pass preventing transmission, would end pandemic.

You ""grow immunity"" Corona viruses, like grow immunity colds flu.

I'm sorry whatever education media subject given warped ideas. sample size one doesn’t mean anything I’ll give alternate view. wife ill February recovered March. tested positive antibodies July.  Hah, Asian countries shut schools first anything else...and region world actually gotten shit control?

Just saying... I've seen interesting posts recent times mostly US citizens wanting express entrance Australia angry allowed jump line. Despite estimated 30k Australians still trying get home overseas. remember one particular post OP said something 1 year+ waiting time going work willing bribe ($100) anyone could provide information would help cheat system.""

Responses thread sarcastic Australians telling call Peter Dutton mandatory donations thinking would work pretty funny.

But seriousness, migrating really hard. I've done life amount paperwork waiting times long. Added covid-19 countries closed migration, especially case Australia. expect $500 ""consultation fee""? correct. Melbourne Australia started lifting 12-week lockdown (!) gatherings houses still severely limited. one visit another house per day each. meet friends outdoors public though. theory people home let guard (as completely natural) start silent chains transmission tricky trace grow spread quickly. least schools, restaurants etc hygiene contact tracing rules expectations, don’t home.

After 12 weeks lockdown feel like shells former selves. think would rather face Americans Europeans facing. cannot even imagine. literally nothing parent comment. Yes, aware. assuming quite lot me.


Tell exactly going solve issue right now, without counting utopia everyone suddenly starts listening, globally?

Eradication virus impossible, requires unseen levels global coordination. broke China, game over.


No, need following.
Acceptance thing endemic, lowering impact, mobilising every available workforce build staff field hospitals.

It's better live reality act accordingly, hope whatever echo chamber banking on. happened happen, matter vow regrettable is. There’s strict definition epidemic wave phase. wave implies rising number sick individuals, defined peak, decline. word “wave” implies natural pattern peaks valleys; hints even lull, future outbreaks disease possible.

Based this, article, yeah, I'd say start 3rd wave. clear peaks declines first 2 waves. yeah, first wave went 0 30k 20k. change leadership change minds people ignorant. Temper hopes. feel like Game Thrones meant said ""Winter Coming.""  curious answer be... almost 1st world countries numbers, 3rd world numbers ... Well. Yes lockdowns present unique problems. one right mind would say consequences lockdown. 

The issue increasing hospitalizations ONE disease. Places nearing capacity capacity. currently seeing true stress test healthcare system, stress enough, it’ll break. Sorry say, healthcare essential service large society get rid that, you’ll see shit ton collateral damage lockdowns would cause.  agree second paragraph, sadly, still significant change positive impact. schools open, kids travel much, clusters localized easier handle.

When schools close, people stay home kids, even medical workers. That's issue.  thats far. 3 months Didn’t see word “almost”. 

“Beating twice” oxymoron proves point little bit. 

But yeah, take European perspective here. I’m looking data. Almost European countries locked down. deep shit again. governments people idiots? are, lockdowns won’t eradicate permanently slow spread. postpone it. New Zealand handling pretty well right . soon Americans allowed countries again.

It's like Trump thought cut escape. Relatively handled black plague better have.. actually we're worse.  one study one college (I believe ohio state) amounted 4 players baseline heart measurements. Cool anecdote though. anyone ever told story, would believe sympathetic. people real life extreme intelligent people aware real cases extreme reactions vaccines. 

Everyone saying cases rare enough benefits outweigh harmful risk majority population. 

Also, different vaccines different strains flu handed year. There’s also developments years different companies. get reaction another flu shot (if ever get another), it’s probably really worthwhile discuss doctor (even get second opinion necessary). Well also infection trajectory spiralling control beyond capacity health system. real Irish issue th continued inability improve system. places well ahead that. El Paso already curfew, lockdown inevitable point locally. Various parts Midwest within weeks literally choice shutdown unless want hospitals simply collapse catastrophic deaths. they? 4th day isolation testing positive. Waiting parents tests come back (both 60 years old) fiancees test (immune compromised) extremely upset way provided leadership country That's okay, I'm banning myself. GTFO “both sides” garbage. I’m tired this. Trump cant burn internet.

Not yet, elect him, might try. make 6 figures easily live high cost area country (people jobs lol).. still selfish prick put $ lives. I've given money ""fun"" time pandemic I'm OK w/ help save lives. Selfish disgusting. Yeah think 4-8 weeks seemed ideal time. 

Remember Wuhan confined everyone apartments January February looked like bad scifi movie? knew know now. wasn’t American lockdown you, wrong. cannot conclusively diagnose COVID thoracic scan. case published anywhere scientific can't find it. Dec. 27th case confirmed PCR sputum sample, still standard, accepted method. spread won’t stop. either fully protect elderly Pregnancy contagious. elderly person willfully contracting Covid put body risk; also exposing family, caretakers, medical staff. mention burdening hospitals.

I get hammered drive public street, right? body choice! Newsweek making headlines now? Cool. Unless close schools can’t see helping much, surveys around COVID positive say 37% got school child, 25% work, 12% bar restaurant. Note that’s think got it, may correct it’s interesting survey.  know math hard, 35000 2.9% 1.2 million... Nearly guys! least deaths! common that, though? read similar anecdotal stories nothing shows common is. People get chicken pox multiple times happen enough people concerned it. No, again.

You parents make sure kids still learn, either outside teachers giving follow teachers lessons. Meanwhile, parents able so, work go home tired anything, 5 children can't behind backs, proper ressources (mainly computers) follow teachers lessons, immigration population speak French. everyone equal. true school, even true home. Well Canada clearly handling much better knew backing someone values money lives would bad business pandemic? 


/HARD really though? France population 6 times bigger Sweden. 30 times many ICU.

Same goes Italy. 1500 ICU.

Sweden 50 ICU. population size numbers would 300. 
How come italy it’s lockdowns lack evil overlord tegnell 5 times many ICU per capita?

Kiwi problem? see everytime check in. It’s sad. guy said masks don’t help February? Damn! Stay safe wear mask! ""Somewhere around December start see companies enough events"" data safety monitoring board look details, Fauci said.

I think Pfizer ahead this, though. seemed surprised enough events yet even yesterday, seem think next week.

EDIT: add another comment posted...

For whatever reason, [Fauci is] thinking ""events"" going happen soon. Pfizer thinks will.

I'm sure many people sitting body Pfizer actually seeing many events fast they're happening, but...[t]here people know they're 21 29 31. 15. 3. highly doubt Pfizer CEO, Bourla, knows, people there's got rumors flying around. right rumors going Bourla wrong ones going Fauci? vice versa? We'll find out, suppose. truly believe there's way safely. go certain bar masks, hand sanitize, sit buddies beers, sit booth seperated least 1 2 tables. feel like need sometimes sanity. First wave went ~33% going back up. Second wave dropped 50% going back up. would call substantial. Intentionally? Haha, that’s laughable. Infecting someone ailment didn’t even know (no symptoms diagnosis) would considered “intentional.” already certain laws regarding type thing... look up.

And “unnecessary?” unnecessary needing make living? 

Ultimately though, liberties rights. assume incalculable risks everytime leave house go outside, would **your choice**, btw. absolutely personal responsibility anything anymore? Hoping antivaxx ruin again... Well analogy car Princess Diana rounding corner? Spain 10 days. Norway like 3 months+ vacation office workers, always jealous branch would disappear like quarter year around Christmas go skiing travelling.

Also plus really eating fish.. know like Americans though, would culture shock, whenever people company visited friendly/delightful/humble people. 


I like cold snow, guess ever live somewhere else I'd want go Germany. rest world going everything power keep us locked we're dead, they? stops us using test trace fast testing help ease that? I'm seeing lot countries including mine rounding corner even without vaccine, giving controlling mitigating inherently western thing? also insisted organize national election peak first wave political courage. also compulsory liar covid also rest I'm tired make list. indeed blood many strikers well Castaner covid. deepl translation local Saturday lost sense smell, distinguish sweet/salty/acid tastes, etc., feel normal, go work, masked transport ... know may wrong, want sit work week half ago mother told feel shit, guess picked up, also went work quietly + mother works infectious diseases department hospital, perhaps that's everything starts.


I mean can't comprehend level egoism stupidity... people get mandatory vaccination, sterilization Oh ignorant deluded beautiful science conflicted. article linked saying greater risk getting Covid flu shot. South Korea Singapore reporting deaths vaccine administrated. study saying flu shot reduces coronavirus infections South Korea pressing forward despite deaths saying linked.

Only someone broken critical thinking facilities (or disinformation bot) would dismiss non zero risk getting flu vaccine facing complications. 

If healthy never needed flu vaccine, earth point getting one flu virus almost eradicated season one MIGHT linked issues?

Don't use slur like anti-vax shut legitimate concern people free voice discuss. There's virtually reason healthy young adult getting vaccine year KEEPING HEALTHY BOOSTING IMMUNE SYSTEM.

You really screw loose think two simple messages worth downvoting slurring anti-scientific herd mentality bullshit. Proud you. wish people would that. see stuff snap, know addresses. get angry seeing stories though. seems unlikely. right around 1100/day last week. Yep. Tis season, yo. dude, really? im *wishing* could get one country shortage even asking healthy 60-69yr olds skip year. ive got chance making cut. available you, wouldnt try protect yourself? acquaintance mine posted info Halloween party Snapchat. Let's say County Sheriff aware underage drinking, marijuana consumption, gathering large enough banned. even care first two, want reckless pandemic, deserve whatever comes way. Yeah realised that. Especially hours later corrected he's still spouting original bullshit. many states electoral college votes. enough dems exceed repubs vote. I'm conflicted much outbreaks actually sway voting results.  Denial help. won't. headline read murdered republicans Especially nape neck trade freedom safety deserve neither. MF clearly troll thrive spreading lies misinformation, point showing what's true what's false, report hell SOB/POS. likely last month's Bikefest. China never claims winner. China never sees pandemic game. here's question, think game? way cruel population overwhelmingly supported it?

You mean like slavery? media talking party politics competent, pro-science, pro-expert leadership common denominator. ones could curb plague ones could come together save themselves, keep fighting house burning down. Rookie numbers. Let’s 1M per week! USA! USA! 🇺🇸 🦅 said January never materialized Winter number, temperature telling people keep healthy boost immune system apparently worth downvoted for. 2020 crackpot sub. That’s Sweden did. Sweden failed. Next. Everything know Itaewon Itaewon Class. planning go SK year ... Trust forgotten Trump wins reelection. media encouraging massive protests coast coast coronavirus news silenced China never claimed winner. contained virus stopped people dying. That's it. We're COVID dumpster fire. average daily case rate 80/100K almost twice high Florida's worst days. worked Public Heath state twenty years. We're going need refrigerated semi-trailers.

So people listen republican party. voted GOP Legislature even meet tries stop efforts limit spread. listen Trump deny severity Covid. wear masks!!!

**Go help Dig Graves people Wisconsin Killed !!!!!**

This second outbreak accident! completely avoidable. instead Gop Tavern League tries stop Covid prevention, even limiting bar occupancy? GOP leaders support anti-mask mandates. legislature even meet.  Trump holds campaign rallies without regard health risks. people still wear masks. We're willfully stupid die.

And believe ghosts dead haunt responsible today HELL tomorrow. started 100k day, would take little less year entire population get it(not even including exceptional growth)....the tf get point makes PRC number 2 handling pandemic. know, one earliest thoughts going ""If send everyone home weeks pay stay there, really take chance public policy opportunity really *push* people exercise eat better. Make 'national quarantine resolution', bring celebrities influencers it, give people something positive focus feels like still modicum control.""

And remembered half country damn near exploded Michelle Obama said maybe kids eating carrots instead chips school lunches. I’ll informed: Denmark mandated masks public transport since august. tomorrow masks also compulsory shops indoor places public acces. 

Denmark lowered number participants public events 50 10. Sweden shortly raised 50 300. 

The differences Sweden Nordics spring many. Sweden significantly less significantly later others.

And still case. Uyghur population increases rapidly Han ethnicity Xinjiang. Worst genocide ever. Ich würde deutsch vorziehen Facts don’t care feelings ""rounding curve"" past month. wide curve. /s 5000 per day considered upper safe limit. rare cases even much long term. 2000IU safe beneficial people unless doctor says go higher. ffs Lincoln project leaking.

Anyone whos find persuasive bumbling fuckwit, btw. mean, absolutely juicy fuckin' marks.  Considering point know many underlying mechanisms virus disrupting immune response know coronaviruses go that, 99.999% likely make vaccine circumvent that, although first generation vaccines might imperfect. Read r/covid19 sub constant flow information this. mystery anyone reading stuff, time consuming nearly simplistic people make viruses (and interaction immune system) be. Reported, everything posted thread pure misinformation What? No. thing matters spot hospital need it, you’re dead cause didn’t one. Also, people capacity.  soldiers machine guns stations here. Ignore guy. infection rate lowered severe measures high again, assertion, guy tell us I'm wrong. would add Singapore list. Circuit breaker ended months ago, friends allowed gather, eat indoors, work almost normally added caveat mask. Community spread non-existent outside migrant worker dormitories. Idk Taiwan HK, they're probably okay well. Well already .1% population hospitalized Covid talking ass. Stuff closed \*despite\* schools opened. Stuff closed \*so that\* schools open. Think way. Ive worn mask several times (I usually wear one grocery stores) havent gotten stares. sure self concious? know infected 

 Asymptomatic infection 

The incubation period (generally speaking) 14 days symptom appears. 

The virus still cross spreading period true lockdowns. People continued come go pleased. going eliminate virus. We're going lean effective vaccine like infectious diseases leave trail disability lesser extent death, like measles.

SARS-CoV-2 widespread infects many species candidate elimination now. Measles better candidate can't use animals humans close contact reservoirs. However, measles vaccine made non problem people longer large population left disabled childhood pathogens covered MMR vaccine. sure makes crucial difference. live Switzerland, Geneva canton wearing masks obligatory believe already two months, still highest number infected. think asian tracking approach made real difference, see quarantine anyone place infected ones.

But mention tracking Europe...oh boy. Germany debt gdp ratio 60 %. USA 107%. Germany lot better position handle cash problems don’t like wearing mask. I’d rather not. fking pandemic that’s killing people, it’s least do. 30 mins tops grocery store. 

Had enough morons prolonging causing unnecessary death suffering everyone else. test death rate lower, fewer infected gets undetected. Lockdowns work small closed countries, worked gargantuan country like USA. # Yeah think it’s understandable argue that’s also worst case scenario. get broken arm can’t get treated there’s failures many levels. point governments job break healthcare covid vs everyday activities. Broken arms, heart attacks treated much easier effective covid patients. Many hospitals already ICU vs COVID wards. keep beds open everyday accidents. it’s fair maybe right it’s smart thing criteria? mean better faster / less lag? disagree. common coronavirus cold passes susceptible 6 months year. ( opposed common cold viruses like adeno rhino virus). 

If true sars cov 2 concerning news. means virus endlessly circulating unless effective vaccine requires multiple doses. ( like common cold does).

Which case would mean many serious cases continually, continual living high alert state that's needed suppress it, like Vietnam, New Zealand, Taiwan etc. Getting first ""yeehaw"" i'm victorian never learned geography history teaching bit lockdown (i highly recommend fun geography game). good picking education left off, never late learn something new expand knowledge! 

also, recently, everything knew american geography came TV shows/films, feel bad knowing states :) Honestly, already expecting MLB mandate parade. seal deal. Showing world champions drinking huge groups middle pandemic look great. think two parallel statistics (that 90% overlap) one easier produce faster (yes, even lag faster) one accurate takes longer time (death certificates take weeks file in, Sweden)? anecdotal, know couple Colorado something similar 2-3 couples. rented Airbnb likely interacted one another weekend. tested positive days later.

Small gatherings like ton cases spreading. said use one wont havent made General recomendation. small important difference.

Maybe think people deciding use motivated thus better handling correctly? Paywall. Could wearing masks cultural thingbover whenever sick? /S 

In seriousness, (Japan South Korea) wore cold consideration fellow coworkers something years now. stop ignoring science dude. 24 confirmed (probably 10x that) hundreds millions cases shockingly common. say often actually think trolling me. Yeah elderly people risk higher chances living still vastly higher dying. know I’m wrong sub post people would truly rather see family enjoy life say worst case scenario 15% chance dying. people adults evaluated risk said okay taking it. reading disinformation.

You're listen anyone else, that's sure. look rare all. looks shockingly common. lot us even get first. We've known this, correct? That's shit dude, come top dude, get man!! It'll end alright Also, get sick one, depletes defences leaves susceptible getting other. entirely possible time :( greatest respect, would go gym, enclosed space people breathing hard exertion? Touching surfaces on. trying avoid catching virus, make sense me. recent surge going quickly advance clinical trials run US Europe. reason feels rushed explains happening faster. Literal race bottom going here. pretty sure China sweating profusely diplomaic reprucussions pandemic.

The biggest winner Taiwan weathered pandemic watch world going China trump fucks locked arent wearing them. help them, hurt us either. Maybe it'll even work favor. FUCK YEAH! Better question western people ready Asian approach? one example- tracking software (huge push Europe, even need write restaurant name lot folks use fake one). guess US folks fond tracked 24/7? soon measures bit relaxed virus comes Yeah Europe playing catch again. start pandemic Europe winning cases deaths. Europe locked bit let US catch up, US front time turn tables. time Europe get serious again. *00,000 cases day They’re tiktok blame actual failure next democrat president. everyone gets safe Yes vaccine going one stop solution everyone hoping for. Maybe eventually years testing contact tracing mask wearing forms soci distancing tools available taking us 2021 dystopian 1984 bullshit. Makes sense, there’s major correlation vitamin deficiency COVID wherever country getting cold people need comfort inside... it’s obvious. Anything done comfort instant gratification detrimental side effects, always always will. everyone that, would statistics New Zealand now. som people (a large enough number matter least).

So assuming large sum people smart things planning strategy, maybe dumb. world turned upside down.

Or bad guys along better PR. That's quite upsetting. feel like I’ve spent 90% Reddit history making point again— nothing simple everything crazy complicated. doesn’t matter can’t explain literally anything completely sentences.

The world fractal. could spend lifetime studying nutrition, look bit closer could particular food way interacts human body. 

We use abstractions explain world around us usually works great. lot people, calories vs calories works great abstract model explain fitness, assuming abstraction subject isn’t nuance single human could possibility learn lifetime huge mistake.

Everything insanely complicated can’t assume know enough subject conclusively speak authority it. share particular abstraction using might work great many people can’t act like subject. Regardless results, Trump administration still occupy White House mid-January. That's 3 whole months. Makes wonder called ""anti BODY"" supposed defending body. really help tummy eat yogurt drink lavender chamomile probiotic tea every day! hurt error side caution scenario. constant debate ""do masks really help? statistical proof?"" boggles me. concept here. Like, maybe much, maybe gut bacteria shit either, DO? worth case helpful, bc hurt it.

Not attack you, Magnesus, throwing opinion ether here. know. really tough many people immature. round get worse.  One week later , New Years. going that. sacrifice willing make. government bunch stubborn old pricks like put blame ""left"" west, Germany especially, EU. ask help ""the rotten west"". Fuck government. Alexanders called state Utah see options given travel code allowing get approved test St. George still get Maui.

They really mad state Utah giving incorrect information. People stupid stuff name supposed ""rights"". thinking blindly declare common decency. dare expect people think others respect one another. Next thing know russian. claimed. sub find articles masks probably ineffective beginning pandemic. studies claimed demonstrate politicians spread news alongside media. cares? Americans don’t..... bother reporting this? makes really sick reading people's bs schools safe case since started August...🤦🏻‍♀️

Speaking bit prematurely imo. Looks like studies prevent hospital workers getting works recently hospitalized patients admitted still underway. Hopefully something works out.

Goes show though, let’s assume first round vaccine candidates flawless. need keep pace battling virus. good, stressful time. What's favorite?  question curiosity: Finnish health care system centralized, decentralized like Sweden's (where 21 regions responsible hospitals such)? averaging 70k long time another day. favour people grabbing phones telling people fuck off

I'm favor people going jail. cares? Americans don’t give shit, still reported?   true, close schools things get control parents learn F general public. Well, least Germany problem sending hundreds kids home one case comes up. Closed days everyone gets tested.

Also printed forms parents need fill else kid can't get school. Forms asking confirm kids contact known cases, risk regions, nobody shows signs illness.

If sign well knowning stated requirements fulfilled risk fine spreading infectious disease couple k€; specific law also includes jail sentences serious events. different levels unreasonableness usually legal system takes account. There's lot holes defense Yup. know people ""sanitizing groceries bringing inside"" stage back April without care world. stand corrected, targeted, arbitrary again, illegal what's targeted legally protected. anti-masker legally protected. There's absolutely nothing stopping someone hiring anti-masker.

Then OP feel empowered give case need ""figure need figure reason. hiring someone anti-masker illegal. Maybe want let snooping social media.

Then say that?

Am supposed take words face value? Hey now.

You're rockstar. might actually effort Pfizer's part de-politicize vaccine. Trump touching could give kiss death. Releasing either positive negative trial results week election could viewed politically motivation either party best, regardless election goes, avoid that. don’t know getting downvoted.

Wouldn't feel empowered say ""because opinion masks""? 

Why give additional reason besides trying mitigate liability?

Because clearly justified reason would absolutely open legal action used official reason. literally throw shit streets 

Its filthy Mumbai. Maybe comfortable coming saying whatever reason. 

Plenty anti-mask douchebags become violent confronted. 

Or want deal argument someone denies reality science. 

Or work someone anti-mask. 

Or want give douchebags reason feel like they're victims. 

Personally, I'd tell straight complete lack regard others, disregard science, stupid propaganda hire them, people things different reasons. 

There's plenty legal things people lie about/make excuses for. I'm pretty sure moment vaccine approved, large swath people going act like _over_, even though it'll take months distribute it, lot people straight get it. That's going probably result few... extra interesting... months. one seems participants encouraging. 44,000 good size number people. hanging racist cops uncaring doctors Yeah pretty tough city living lockdown 100 days know daily 14 day average 2.7 cases things Except covid autoimmune disease. would otherwise, never recover it. clearly case. there’s one time year Halloween parties!

I agree earlier vaccine arrives, lives could theory saved lockdowns. remember back March experts incredibly skeptical vaccine produced 18 months, even succesfull all. know why, country, majority educators, psychologists, politicians, educators parents seem online teaching. Every single day articles published detrimental effect online teaching/learning students, claiming ""learning gap"" experiencing never closed, social capabilities diminish, difference people various social backgrounds increase harshly, nothing comes close in-person learning. wanna mean people endangering lives innocent people need send many.

Feel free show said cite specific law he’s violating protected class discriminated case. Guilty conscience. talking moms article doubt others feel same. heard lots complaining lock downs kids around 24/7. doubt hard, but, know, responsibility. still pretty good mortality rate, maintained stable lower levels whole pandemic. pretty nice efficient healthcare system is, especially compared circus NFZ Poland (not talking medical staff, I'm talking administration management). well also employers think thing fake forcing employees go back office work 100% remotely. Callous, hostile, deceitful definitely thing antisocial. allowed-by-yourself kill neighbors using virus murder? means less likely get flu, less likely get flu COVID time, overall putting less strain healthcare resources Unfortunately feature pandemic kind person needs reminded obey rules kind person wont allow anyone tell obey rules. I’ll bookmark come back month year. don’t think age well lol. I’m obsessively healthy mid 20s honestly don’t need worry. would take Covid willingly right prove stupid whole shenanigan literally can’t find any. going parties, flying planes, wearing mask, lifting weights sharing kinds equipment, smoking buds strangers sharing doobies, matter hard try can’t catch it! probably sick fantasy get die though huh?

I wouldn’t calling people like brethren kind, party not. Roundin’ corner moment now...  Europe, would big news everywhere frontpage.

In US, tuesday I'm sure still holds true heavy observer initial 5 months pandemic USA, always noticed Tuesdays would lower end cases deaths. trend still happens today, well 90,000 friday Saturday. dont think hit 100,000 per day til next week coming. 
 
Damn. imagine benevolent sexism help pair charged. 

Imagine black teenage male (rather legal counsel) trying assert overcharged. Jesus friggin christ... know dad, goes work leaving mom decide whether bad mom going work.

Wtf wrong people. crazy story is, feel like two 18 year old girls pinning 270lb, 6'5 man craziest part Hopefully rounding term. know that. Illinois governor better betting he'll top bottom bunk. nominate r/coronavirus MVP Argentina still lockdown curve never flattened. Every week cases idea whats real situation here. Positivity rate reached 70%, weeks 90% confirmed cases previous months.

People use masks. mass testing, tracing contacts anything. government stopped caring people same. also deal /r/FloridaMan People fucking unstable Look Midwest’s per capita hospitalization surge, there’s still several months cold weather go through

Edit - [national data article talks showing 46% Shit. Already drunk reloading ammunition tonight that..😂 Thays odd. Sneezing rare symptom covid. usually true, haven’t trusted legal system overall LONG time. fuck wow, well works whatever blood/the docs says sure Every city spikes. matter if, when. Even mostly rural states issues. 🤪🔫🧑🏻‍🚀 glad shot. We'd another ""racial"" situation hands. i’d make chicago joke genuinely terrible hope worker recovers. family member purposely wear mask ""get rise people see anyone notices."" 

This study makes lot sense. i’d make chicago joke genuinely terrible hope worker recovers well. judge would sentence wood chipper. Absolutely, though looking similar places US, like Hawaii, I'm lead believe differences biggest affect would government culture, size itself. 

China larger population massive outbreak, government able get control it. saying China's way good way go all, show possible despite size density. np :) mention people would use bathroom Good thing need job anybody else. Infact handful companies.

oh good you. real internet superstar. personal factoid utterly irrelevant described. Try stay point. opinions behaviors irrelevant light matter: able job successfully

really? ""in opinion Jews trying take world.""; or, ""my opinion age consent bullshit"" or, ""Last night drove around yelling obscenities poor people.""  ""opinions behaviors"" irrelevant light skills, Mr Big Time Company Man? really matter, seem take glee denying people employment power seem want feel rather reason hiring first place: fill position company.

lol. Well kind made projection there, hoss. haha, well lot fat consuming vit (hope wifey allows steak) news ‘water wet’ &amp; think sun ‘might fucking hot touch’, find short break... Jfc, happens keep decrease funding education. idiots coming woodwork. Business owners, part, non-essential, yet demanding snowflake-like treatment them. Hmm.....   I'm state state-wide mask mandate. Proper mask wearing hard do. actually required. yet, walk around still see people without masks MANY people masks wearing wrong. Nose sticking mask common. Mask pulled chin neck, really wearing all, common.

The science behind simple. actual wearing mask easy properly. Yet, people it. face worldwide pandemic, even getting cooperation simple act wearing mask cannot counted on. despair getting general public anything sensible, ever. IANAL = Lawyer teacher. Back August, district planned hybrid (part in-person, part online). Roughly week start date, school board called meeting. Various administrators made simple argument (which I'm paraphrasing): ""The argument full remote education students receive sub-par education. go back school person, many teachers threatened quit take year leave, many substitutes said work conditions, need hire unqualified, unlicensed subs teach students. Going back person virtually guarantees sub-par education students.""

Each member school board given opportunity speak. expressed disappointment, agreed remote learning best option. Except one guy. One member school board said call teachers' bluffs. cited Reagan firing 11,000 air-traffic controllers banning industry strike. asked can't thing? Call bluff. Tell teachers get work, revoke application year leave, fired. administrators tried explaining would never able hire sufficient number qualified teachers school year began, firing many teachers would definitely result students receiving sub-par education. board member convinced. voted remote learning.

That's school board member thinking teachers expendable easily replaceable. Bart daredevil episode! Used VHS. Man, that’s swift kick nostalgia bag right zkagdvzvIs 😆🖐🎬🎗🌧ygt 🎖🎟🎻🥈Vagkkdg🥖🇧🇴🇦🇽🇦🇪🇹🇰🇦🇽🇻🇪🇼🇫😁🕰🤠😮

And failed mention means **test-trace-isolate-protect** services everywhere, clearly justified performance metrics.  important enough testing capacity pick virus is, detect spikes manage surges.

Those oppose lockdowns seem miss end need lockdowns absence mandatory testing, vigorous contact tracing enforced quarantines.

Pick poison: Either lockdown everyone else actively locate quarantine everyone infected.  Screaming masks good alternative. It’s funny never seems go way. 

I never heard anyone getting violent someone wouldn’t put mask. 

It’s like one side reasonable irrational. supposed catchy one-liner? social since willing go without mask  wish people worried Covid-19 lies would concern people lieing whole damned time.


Given timeframe first month everyone supposed quarrantining anyway.

If stuck home immediate family mask would pretty much pointless 90% country time.



All mask-debaters would still mask-debating even told go stockpile N95's last Christmas. Gee, another study predetermined outcome search data support it. mask protect others breathing you. current retail worker comfort me. Nothing comforting anymore....  haha! People still price gouging thermometers masks. That’s I’m happy PPE supplier selling thermometers $35. I’m sure making little profit. 

I’ve seen ones going $60-$100 sites. People pieces shit exploit crisis. Beautiful strawman really dilemna every elected officer currently believe, save exceptions. can't really get people take pandemic seriously 5 deaths day say France. People become fatigued, become unpopular, scientists called fear mongerers, denial becomes rampant. picture starts making sense people, hospitals already overflowing. Winter coming flu season. He's superhuman. Hope swift recovery. failure dominate. mean someone defend them, fact that's best defense likely says alot.  think quarantine applies spend 24 hours state.

But also it’s like quarantine enforced anywhere Hawaii  Canadian here, sure numbers overall sentiment we’re ok, 2MM people virtual quarantine extremely low case counts that’s probably helping numbers. 

Our largest cities heavily hit expected funnelled returning Canadians sending home. they’re trying things science best can, biggest issue fatigue restrictions, cracks forming public fortitude. Quebec there’s articles people asking data validate specific things shut ex gyms vs malls. Toronto they’re passing laws allow restaurants continue operate outdoors winter, bring blankets suggested mayor. 

Christmas coming huge portions country live cities. Example I’m Nova Scotia, partner Vancouver, live Toronto. We’re planning visit family haven’t seen family year two week quarantine upon arrival cabin. 

And case counts slowing Ontario exploding get December holidays we’ll good shape think everyone mentally knows holidays make break.
Yeah Ok makes sense. Stay safe there. he's ""critical condition"", normal condition. mean. I'd say lack self-control point stabbing somebody 27 times mental health issue. Lack cohesive leadership plus lot initial cases solve for. 

I’m sure anyone could truly got 50 states unify extended lockdown like would needed pull NZ eliminate things given cases already (confirmed via tests unknown found antibody tests later spring) time starting really act. 

Still, strong leader good long term vision may able least align many people decent start. turn could got things low enough allow effective tracing building testing, surge quarantine processes, even restricting movement higher spread / density areas.

Instead entirely fractured know. made obvious outcomes states never really locked weeks, also left tried much harder fend themselves. lot distain dragged out, short term approaches many state leaders really, weren’t equipped fully understand let alone react here. 

Without either, everyone left sorting state, county, city, business, family individual level... time got NZ doing, deep divided response one trying lead one stab wound away dying Everything Colorado wide open Great mini-series favorite quote too.  know I'm messin goin thru man Holy crap, people losing it. Twas Bart wanted become daredevil going jump springfield gorge...homer ended accident falling gorge getting mangled lifted bonked head way up. jog memory.  might seem like contrary thinking, please recall 9 pharmaceutical companies --including AstraZeneca, Moderna Pfizer-- came publicly stated would rush vaccine. said indicate trust current administration stick known/accepted protocols. Yeah right. Stupid flu shot going pushed hard. Every flu death labeled Covid death cdc suspending flu numbers year. won’t get crap shot ever. ""Thou collection plates filleth faithful believeth science"".

That's bible somewhere think. saw capitalists selling toilet paper facebook 10X's value Covid first hit Lemme guess voting . . . There's features him. mean Fondue? every week here. Apples also good dip there. Comte nice, dry white wine makes good mix. Add garlic Kirsch set. I'm expert, final blood draw February. think enough data release needy late November early December. Rest us Spring. I'm certain got placebo (did antigen test) know enough would tell 77 year old mother get it.  Sweden country earth droplets help spread virus need face masks.

The rest world must comply otherwise tagged Anyone wearing mask might crazy, they're **definitely** stupid. alone reason enough avoid them. get lost? seem replying different conversation. cases like make wonder maybe death penalty bad idea. think NZ domestic travel? # 27 STAB WOUNDS heroes wear capes, wear masks

I love We're talking domestic travel, international travel. least there's justice world still. care are, stab someone 27 times asking wear mask pandemic, piece shit.  Good ole Westside Chicago... I'm born raised... beasts need jail forever... can't racist statement... I'm black man .. safe folks Depending live, could take anywhere hours never police arrive.  Oh yeah, probably blacklisted automod. I've banned handful times mean really want banned, think us knew exactly woman would look like opened article. don’t know anyone who’s died. know people know people that’s extent Maybe craving hands satisfy. Especially private business. 

Like can’t reasonably expect go business without pants yet one screaming “It’s personal CHOICE” it’s accepted. pants don’t save fucking lives. Dude went tanking strategy RPG character points. Pretty sure ""chicks dig scars"" older internet. Nah makes up. people create YouTube videos back up. yet politically, can't get support are. Catch-22. Schools LA county mostly remote. wonder thoughts black face are? Mask usage almost 100%, absolutely concept personal space social distancing. Restaurants still packed, surely help things right now. Absolutely tank. Praise mean Chicago. They’ll back streets years. bit nuanced that. Yes, scientists controlled diets activity levels, calories calories works.

However, normal setting type calories intake definitely affect things like hunger levels much eat. glycemic index carbs eat makes big difference too, sugars highly refined carbs tend bad.

Simplifying ""Most humanity ate high carb diet centuries."" misses point. Humanity ate vegetables occasional fruit carbs agriculture. Even agriculture, people ate minimally processed whole grains industrial revolution.

Just humans carbs centuries mean eating sugar loaded foods shitloads pasta, white bread, etc. Health care huge part french social contract. country streets due reform retirement system right COVID. can't say ""let eldery die years earlier, let hospitals overrun go work"". social consequences inaction, even outside direct indirect deaths, would huge country like France would mean open door populists either side spectrum. think history covered explaining consequences that. like people kept pointing california control cases deaths


But, texas, smaller population, well less testing


Has cases deaths california


Everything california stopped. Weird korean citizens returning cant turn away Constitutions woefully unprepared pandemic well. Belgian Dutch saying ""emergency trumps law"" apply imo. Yep. believe every doctor planet it.

Even Rwanda Bangladesh, doctors paid fortune diagnose COVID.

It's \*huge\* conspiracy alright. People already “back normal” Excuse me, Doctor Who. recently single dude nearing end youthful times, put real damper getting freak on.

Plus know, grandparents really old seen year. No, kind stickiness, LOL! That's rookie inflation, son. one active case summer. **One**. two week stretch **zero** new cases.

In past two weeks, we've broken daily case records multiple times, outpaced Quebec per capita, almost certainly break 200 daily cases week.

One guess PC shithole province is. Weds/Thurs typically deaths, Fri/Sat cases. Cases trend 86-90k end week. many people confusing inconvenience oppression. asked wear mask infringement rights.  really forced drama then. Fuck Hawaii choice isn’t though. choice wear one affects everyone come contact with, get vulnerable people killed.

Your choice selfish. Tell French teacher died. So, Trump one said dangerous deadly virus Bob Woodward, tape. nothing golfed rallied fat orange bankrupt ass off? Criminally liable right there.  would think would even important take Covid seriously can’t wfh. Essential workers really ones mask. Anyone else lock down. people come work company everyone else stays home keep safe. i’m Chicago walked past two offices one wearing mask inside :O  authoritarian domestic travel? happen literally anywhere. Stoners arent exactly known confrontational. huge economic ramifications shutting things - business safely operate established CDC guidelines masks social distancing there's reason shut down. course, unless overarching stay home order impacts essential businesses. feels like we're heading direction again. Wow that’s brutal...glad guy survived, tank! Anything less would’ve goner least US, large swath people already acting like it’s heck going ? everything open what? lockdown?! they'll thank god recovery. hopefully shot? Beautiful sentiment People wound real tight, pandemic stress economic pressure. making excuses absolutely unacceptable behavior, might hate. might stress, complete lack coping skills, access weapon. go eat lunch shirtless everyday. Sociopaths. science. Jail life. district went back virtual yesterday. superintendent already sending emails saying county's numbers well threshold 14 cases per 100,000, Zip code barely threshold seems dropping, fully expecting back in-person 11/9 sooner.

Meanwhile kid sister tells watching Snaps classmates early Halloween party two party-goers got positive COVID tests next day. Even Zip code's numbers awful, teenagers idiots. We've already 7 staff throughout district test positive past two months. surprise teachers quit next time we're forced back in-person education. Cool.

Now reverse roles. Imagine 6'5"", 270lb man attacking 5'4"" woman knife garbage asked put mask. That’s Jason Vorhees’ mom level shit there. Lol. tf cultural change? It’s almost like premeditated. know you’re going asked wear mask go store? Clearly you’re little wound issue. Google “at employment”. prescribed week ago hope need forever. hate taking anything.  us states currently quarantine list? Didn’t take place UK?

Edit nvm actually read lol bad Huh must front page reddit. non American, life like without guns. Far less fatal cases. guys truly need guns safety?  prorate somewhere like Czechia US size you’d seeing half million new cases daily 6,000 daily deaths. things could certainly get lot worse things left unchecked Pieces shit. really hope survives. able contain absolutely phenomenal. human. Hope makes it. Meanwhile US arguing masks shaming people wearing public exactly doing. 

Also CDC director said masks effective vaccines. 

I know I'll get downvoted, want stop thing, argue things work. Pick Asian country. Asian country. instead. Japan, Southkorea, Vietnam, china, Hong Kong. Etc etc etc. think people aren’t going see families Christmas, you’re delusional

""Although feeling lesson learnt, rough first three weeks January 2021."" Hmm...  shouldn’t sacrifice life hypochondriacs waiting magical vaccine. won’t take it. really interesting watch hang deaths Andrews head equally claiming worse flu, alarmist hoax, even top 20th deadly things. know made laugh sudden, did. right thing Good luck getting top outbreak. guys worked hard smart I'm sure trouble. guess color never cease amuse me. Plus, internet 24/7 age, instantly fed news happening pretty much anywhere (and bad news tend get much attention).

So hear happening often. 

Imagine past eras today's information spreading technological capabilities.

Your damn phone start bleeding. i’m already seeing food shortages again, empty shelves lot unavailable options local subway in: people assholes also mean opinion got cold drink outside. drinking outside lakes rivers sends everyone inside bars. time decided UW systems try person class  school would give shit; it'd snowflake parents would whine sake whining. aside, kids practice social distancing keep masks on, they'd likely crap area around school. 

Here's idea: make parents responsible snotty kids stop using schools babysitting institution Well, yes. Also sorry came across sounding weird, I’m autistic sometimes seem rude. I’ve done livestock processing (not fun task) know decent amount anatomy. lot damage arms legs know arteries/veins are. I’m really, really glad security guard alive. said wear masks beginning? Paris 20 times density Auckland Wellington. Lockdown works controlling spread tricky unless really impenetrable borders harsh counter measures. course was. Legally this, asshole takes liberties people's health protected category. Obviously, anyone going tell them. call ""not fit"" move onto next candidate. Less drama. business legally choose hire someone behaving way conducive business  sadddd real land terrorist. TWENTY SEVEN STAB WOUNDS? Florida permanent summer time. states forced indoor weather. attitude 🙄 live Manhattan. experience. Maybe VENTILATION still widely ignored. agree statement europe saying gonna bad bad time  tend straight indifferent pretty hard slog us Oz, looks like hard work might finally paying off. might even Christmas degree normalcy. Sweden size population highest death toll world per capita couple weeks spring.

If remember correctly 185 peak deaths single day irregular reporting average like 120 deaths per day peak week.

Our max 2288 hospitalized including 533 ICU.

So Czech numbers really high. unknown reason ratio ICU hospitalized lower peak. “The family vacation supposed one week, quarantining 14 days didn’t make sense.”

Hmm quarantining? Hawaii sees Utah antics sends back desert. Imported cases managed well. S. Korea's main problem contain reduce local transmissions. good! Yet everywhere US go maskless due ""medical conditions"" repercussions wearing completely wrong.

So keep wearing ""vented"" P100 half face respirator protect 70% people can't follow simple instructions wear mask properly. defense coronavirus island middle ocean oppressive totalitarian government actually agree this, though many impediments saving pennies. Plus, want lives change, they'll practice sort denialism get way. [John Cena Meme sound] r/RoughRomanMemes reason react aggressively aggressive drivers. never know one psycho. Source? “It helps gauge attractiveness”

Exactly love wearing mask. Apparently, get harassed significantly less men can’t see face expressions. Also don’t feel obligated cater people feel kind entitlement communication. 

It genuinely feels like privacy life. anything hindrance me. know bunch people think too. Well, first off, would recommend firearm already one. Take couple classes. Learn use maintain it. Keep loaded.

Secondly, people right gotta worry about. Seriously doubt two women fans Trump look did. dangerous world nobody legally obligated protect yourself.  victim blaming, learning lessons events. Moving forward, policies ask leave reach phone. Learning could save future guard's life. think anyone stabs 5 time able stab back don’t use dogs like Denmark even accurate detect COVID?? *slams table* 28 stab wounds! Im counting pulling Iron Man Endgame reading thread lol...and might too

Good Luck Except Massachusetts costs $160 get test aren’t feeling sick need guess? 🤣 understand fundamental meaning ""rights"", care try. Well, guns commonly far deadlier white arms. wish they'd city, 73 year old dad prostate cancer years ago, can't stop getting dinner friends restaurants. Sounds like county Ohio. lot people wearing masks dick noses. Had/have lot protests masks, agent orange(tRump) parades, etc. household stays home one designated person leaving groceries. go mask on, make purchase leave.

....unless someone throws temper tantrum wearing mask shoots store clerk security guard. weed; people's entitlement. may conflict base, they'll take seriously they'll start actually acting anyone dares wear mask. know, unstable people.  West Side Chicago. bueno. I'll pass along see, thanks mate. Amazon much Hello what? herd immunity discussed never implemented stragedy? 🤦🏻‍♀️ don’t even democracy. Electing rich person isn’t democracy. live dictatorship rich. it’s  legal system absolutely one willing defend clients, everyone criminal trial lawyer.

We'd get aging metro hit shops, too. good things like expect city, also far beautiful like people suggest.

There much beautiful, safe, clean, friendly french cities elsewhere, though. Well people go work, sit crowded busses bunch strangers spend whole day work dozens sometimes hundreds people. see biggest outbreaks, next huge weddings parties? factories offices. five year old taken pointing people. ""Hey, mask needs pulled up... like this."" died manager Lowe's. manager thanked pulled mask up. say anyone, I'd worried fight.  viable public health infrastructure really sucks, it.

you reap sow.

Responsible governments able provide proper testing contact tracing help manage return semblance normalcy. Things would look much better test much!  /s bad United States natives pariahes now, would go heartbeat! C’mon Canada, keep  state? dont think job related testing weekly however often gets taken state could wrong. going shortage unprecedented acts depravity unprecedented crisis.

As primarily scientists welcomed idea forum including discussion economic, social, (relevant) political impacts outbreak. welcome devolving tabloid-level coverage daily, local trauma. Even said incidents verifiable. Regardless color cunt deserves rot prison Well, due mandatory testing anyway. (Port workers currently required fortnightly tests). know, places seemed licked it, back late Spring, early Summer! welcome! like happening heat moment, nature weapon, exactly stab happened call question level intent harm.

It heat moment, responding fear legitimate outrage, surprise...the weapon knife disguised comb, exactly utility knife something grabbed haphazardly immediate environment...the stabs happened one another, 27 times row, chest wounds leaving critical condition hospital...

 ""BREAKING: France reports 523 new coronavirus deaths hospitals nursing homes, biggest one-day increase since April ""

That jumped quite alarming headed least bad first time. 100-200 deaths day really alarm anymore. I'd feel alarmed USA hits 1750 day hope doesn't. mind kinda set fall covid wave would really get bad almost like summer outbreaks. really really wanted regeneron game changer get released quickly ever since first reading earlier year. drug could kinda heal sick lower complications deaths would really good future readily available rapid tests free public might issue  story says didnt need stitches must stabbed worlds smallest knife. Probably nail file lol. Dammit! first thought lol Early really high death rate, never bad hospitalizations. largely based around issue hospitals know provide care unless needed vent, sending home asking get pulse oximeter. O2 got low, drive hospital EMT wasn’t coming you. rough month. Two stories 7 months ago probably weren’t best choice response. they're not. Oh yeah think mention it. downloaded Grubhub hopefully work too. apps better guess. also told would help pay bills month convinced continue Uber thankfully. Suddenly, r/collapse seem crazy anymore... job allow getting sick'

Guess know arent swedish? Every job Sweden allows getting sick, currently dont even need doctors note stay home work get full benefits. posting videos Denmark? agenda? People people. little genetic difference hair eye color skin. same.

I 100% realize certain minorities beehind starting line comes opportunites need address focus education opportunites minorities. takes TIME.

In meantime, 14% population comitting majority violent cime wondering violent encounters police.

Stop shot, simple that.

It's racist say this, fact. sad fact, fact.

Cops tto gun black people, right go home familes put lives danger, forfeit right live.

Edit: Phone. Aw damn, stabbed 1 time could make Detroit Become Human reference! /s Fear, man. Fear. That's ""news outlets"" prey fucking gross. mean UK study? studies pretty much line study. legal perspective matters terms strength defenses argument whether premeditated, challenges intent element may even introduce self defense argument affirmative defense. slam dunk set defenses, could used help defendants. makes feel better, always wrong decision, man, weather becoming winter-like, restaurants *way* shit creek.   posted many times.

By people political inclinations.

And none seem notice calling actions also oppose.

Guys like want anything. recommending Trump approach nothing. Fantastic, one ever sort legal representation lawyer take case even risk signing public defender, prosecutors free reign charge however want. 

Holy god awful idea. Still ok New Zealand, even San Francisco. 

But holy hell, many places bad right now. can't lucky 2020..... ever. didn’t lose either. Nothing happened taste. But, sense smell went haywire. scents insanely strong. Especially bad ones. able smell shoes another room. thing happened cats litter box. Even though completely cleaned day prior. Trust me-the shoes litter actual culprits. bf super weirded couldn’t smell got super close. occasionally would flat smell things weren’t there- like fire gasoline. returned normal realized bizarre actually been. covid felt kinda like that- honest, seriously think something. 


Disclaimer: wasn’t ever actually tested covid- wouldn’t able time due really strict testing conditions. got honestly terrifying bizarre illness end February stayed around late April. truly believe should’ve hospital got lucky. concerning vitals, Rhonchi sounds lungs, super freaky neurological problems, episode face uncontrollably twitched (I’m aware could’ve meant)- basically ton symptoms nobody knew covid related month later. bf firefighter/EMT well- high risk-and whole shift ended testing positive home trying care me. He’s one took vitals listened lungs. us ourselves. somehow convinced problems breathing anxiety related within two days forgotten sore throat, fever, cough preceded week prior. was...not right. 

Sorry. Always feel like gotta give disclaimer. :/ Wdym? plan represents clear cultural shift. think French live lockdown already?  Thanks letting us know. Great question ask date. wear mask pandemic? say, alright ima head out. Same. Guy floor take elevator me, mask on. ended taking stairs.

Like guy, think so. easy say rot jail, mind keeps going back ""What conditions people live put insane mental framework behavior felt justified time?""

I strongly believe humans born violent lunatics. failure society people like end do, instead guided toward healthy happy lives.

So agree fact people like less common now, speaking statistical historical context, fact events still happen needs understood. believe better make even rare. Or, know, just, know, stab them, someone call police say phone stolen. Crazy. know.

But, no, get it, *incredibly* hard resist stabbing someone 27 times tried take phone store. many rural people believe they're risk. 

Where live rural, hour larger city, people commute work. Banners everywhere supporting incumbent. low mask wearing, maybe 20% (down high 80%). quite concerned. Yeah, man. sound like good dude. Death inevitable want avoid I'm always curious grizzly details like this.  lawyer. He's pretty much obligated say *something* spin it. attorney one cooked term get obviously guilty client sympathy. hard put mask? ""freedom"" worth assaulting someone spending years prison? Jesus.. people mentally unwell. There’s reason behavior.  Yes leftist rule states handicapped testing capacity since day 1. saying along, lutyens media interested blaming modi. Thats BJP ruled states also lowest positive test rates  two

 Number two symptom talking ? company rent apartment got PPP loan didn’t push back rental due dates change late payment policy single time. changed nothing help struggling renters, got bailout money. owner drivers around G Wagon. explain taiwan free corona using method. get measuring temperature gives false positives misses actual corona cases? evidence back up. plenty evidence temperature goes get corona. Plus infrared temperature measuring accurate. Worked China New Zealand. ""Think jobs!""

This short-term reasoning prevented serious attempt stop spread virus, made total result _worse_ jobs. Yeah, he's dickhead, fine pretty reasonable, things considered. Seems like situation handled properly police management. Nothing see here. Strict social distancing unsustainable, that's told use masks. substitute makes imperfect social distancing lot effective. Nah, outside sports. long team right side history they'll fine. worry getting covid worry giving covid. Math checks out. Surprising heard possibility reinfection experts working right now. say quite woods yet. fuck supposed 69 30 sqm apartment, pushups? villas like celebrities preached 'stay home' 4000 sqm yards castles. favorite passtime taking bag, going shopping, also prohibited elderly people 9-12 window shop, late riser. 

Before lockdowns, issues, generally good health.

But I'm argue either. Even die, still support lockdowns work stopping disease, slow it, can't stay lockdown years. Even months damage economy take years get back 2019 levels.

Masks, tests quarantines job slowing disease, that's do. vaccine, can't starve virus infected millions people. China could stopped it, didn't, minute got Wuhan, happened inevitable. *conspiracy hat on*

America let's pretty much everyone covid supposed kill happening America.

It made kill everyone enemy bc America let's many many enemies dying. 

*Conspiracy hat off* Actually, not. antibodies peak start dropping. time next year, could get reinfected.

Now, hospitalized received steroids, means lung damage. 73 lung damage permanent. virus repeats, may worse. neither anti vax ignorant. needle phobia. super difficult explain people reason I'm taking extra vaccines need prepare mentally week, still faint inside nurse's room. easy everyone. odds election either canceled polling stations shut due escalating infections? hilarious image head swabbing 20 people swab realized there’s probably actual way todo without using swab UK, could miss that? cares lot people, mainly kill get away it. many minority party votes completely ignored current system states electors winner takes all?  
 
You add total population top 50 cities match either candidate got last time, that's assuming everyone registered vote candidate.  claiming reality. Hey post I’m feeling proud country. chose right thing although hard option 👍 Yeah understand thought process except carrying virus showing symptoms. even though ""not infected"" well could be. think OP meant say strict sense 30 days strictly defined deadline. Covid positive person dies 31 days diagnosis strictly counted. deadline strict, death might added count, perhaps due factors suggesting ""Covid death"". Planet Earth rid this. 

 Victoria, Australia removed rest planet?  happens? sell everything move tent somewhere? supposed get job conditions? pay laptop/phone/internet/clothes/haircuts etc order even *get* job? makes sense. God, ur bitter bosses choice comply disempowered Bundestag declaring epidemic emergency natl. level.

Where get from? Sweden politicized scary. seen american liberal basically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives wrong.

Why wish Swedes die? 

Just explain Sweden lot, heard immunity strategy, life same. And, want less repressive volontary response also change country core. I.e higher taxes rich, public health care, employee rights etc.

Its like left right agree Sweden didnt anything. wrong. fighting Sweden good bad. Fact 15 countries worse (more count excess deaths) despite really hard lockdowns. lot lot better Sweden hård lockdowns without.

Just clear consider left, im dissapointed american left taking opportunity turn concervatives arguments them. children Well done Denmark, also smart idea close border Sweden lol chili addict symptom feeling heat scares hell me! Number two symptom heart beat. likely sure govt policy infectious disease cause severe breathing problem hampering Sisha bar !!!! Anyone care explain BBC still pushing DHSC numbers deaths people COVID within last 28 days died, regardless actual cause, opposed ONS numbers based COVID death certificate? Seems awfully misleading go winter general death numbers increase anyway. never thought care country.

He warned 9/11 CIA, brushed off: said, ""You've covered ass now"".

Then told series lies start war Iraq, one killed hundreds thousands people Americans 9/11.

Then simply nothing Katrina destroyed New Orleans.

He criminal cared nothing country. Okay people who’ve caught go back anyway bring positive test month ago &amp; say hey like I’ve go on. number reinfection low. Bro first pay 25 trillion $ debt, would talk. Population density low people interact less. happen. “The world changes” yes agree. However, many changes actually bad could prevented simple measures. Handouts? Come man. going send masks, countries got quarantine boxes. didn’t get shit. 1,200 nothing. Stop utilities evictions let everyone stay home couple months. Nooooo pwecious fragile economy!!! Waaaahh! IRS keeps telling it'll reflected next year's tax return. think they're full shit though. America. shithead entitled white fuck whatever make people need help get it. like meme guy sweating trying decide button push Whilst true, answer like saying gamer dont bake bread. lot people gym weights nothing, going job outside pushups isnt going scratch itch. Obviously pandemic depends local area whether smart choice think saying ""cardio free outside"" good answer clearly dont train. would say using ad hominem attacks playbook disingenuous poster we're really going get other. go get flu vacc, I'm going go life. Let's hope us live ripe old age regardless way go ;) Deaths per million compared Norway Finland really says all. Except really technically assault people gone jail fake coughing. There's actually bit goes that, voter ID card struck (among things) everyone ability *get* place give ID - constitutes bar voting seems helpful /s Good know. Stop spreading bullshit please!  tried business? like crashing corner still reduce severity infection, like flu vaccine.

This implications vaccination strategy. vaccine prevented infection entirely could first target potential super spreaders like high personal contact professions. would large impact infection rate vulnerable would protected proxy.

With vaccine, need first target risk severe disease. people mind business criticize Swedish policy? problem Westerners become spoiled children, China played, move huge success. annihilated whole world without war. use vaccine? Fuck dude still see traffic highway. 150 months go herd immunity! even read it? expect get information plans potential timeline developing new drug crucial world? Ah protests.

Yeah wore masks much higher rate dodgers post game.

Nice misunderstanding reality though. Ditto. Deaths lagging indicator. perhaps people start behaving infect others.

Pro tip: Learning best successful learning worst, perhaps look Asia might worth it.

It's individual behaviour, state measures make break it, nation weak poor working TTI. question rest us forced level restrictions sweden, finland scandinavian enjoy nearly normal life?. 

What's happening here?. may stupid least I'm Nance I'd call fucking police there's fun going I'm scared go happened flu vaccine year too. Covid tore badly flu shot matter. got flu shot year advise everyone else too. could potentially much worse hadn't. really ""working government"", bit better US one. Scomo tool I've got every year so. risk group all, mid thirties. I've never asked pay. definitely covered public health insurers. live big french city go downtown Saturday afternoon. People give shit. Restaurants (because bars closed) packed people drink. People waiting lines eat slice cake every fancy cafes. measures worked people acted responsibly, french can't always try game system backfires since less places go to, people pack ones open. 

I trying everything avoid second lockdown still believe right approach, countrymen common sense see getting control unless full lockdown like march place exception junior highschool under, kids need class fucked life. maybe they'll shift goalposts again

Yes. claim fake news still talking make Trump look bad, win lose. Presuming Trump loss, may start saying fake news stop talking Biden inaugurated. thought whole super spreader “some people emitting virus” thing debunked? it’s wrong place / wrong time? 

Like Massachusetts Biogen conference last spring led 10,000 cases — one presymptimatic guy crowded conference people lot close personal networking indoors. 

He wasn’t thousand times contagious presymptomatic person: ideally situated superspread. what? infections government fuck contact tracing again? What’s point low infections can‘t keep way? That's helpful thanks- read earlier reports said om 20% people, guess that's updated since then. everywhere live moment! Holcomb sort spine would big surprise see, America smart. EU second wave US still first, that's HALF waves covid-19.

Winning Shit healthcare unhealthy citizens Canada seeing jump cases two weeks Thanksgiving. U.S. may yet reach total. Pfizer made [vaccine publicly available several weeks ago. consider vaccine successful first readout unless least 77% effective (see page 103). Oxford Trail Brazil originally read looking high risk exposure participants - Doctors, nurses, important hospital workers like cleaners etc likely exposed rather general public. happen could perhaps?  I'm beginning wonder Republicans purpose. whip country panic terrorists, use panic justify illegal war, steal oil, kill tens thousands destabilise ertire regions, thus creating extremists cylce continues. Blame AIDS gay people, everything power screw gay community AIDS run amok point say ""told so"". know old saying attribute malice attributed incompetence, point wonder screwing people like order self fullfil prophecies. Nah, existential dread making this. contrarians issue become highly politicised. 
I live Canada. still know single person real life actually got virus. Nobody know actually knows somebody either. still take lot precautions, I've never actually known anybody get it, even mutual friends. Best luck. usa number 1.. People idiots. education system US needs complete overhaul Damn maybe test report less like countries doing. Sadly Sweden couldn’t pull danish strong measure prohibiting stores sell alcohol 10 since can’t buy 8 way. everyone infected one be. USA!! USA!! USA!! Cardio build muscle bone strength, proper fitting shoes expensive, everyone cardio due health conditions circumstances. example, reduced lung capacity makes cardio difficult. still it, it’s hell.

In reality, cardio weight lifting important parts staying healthy. work healthcare, nobody suggesting people avoid weight lifting order catch covid long you’re young healthy, everyone afford weight lifting equipment use home. public health risks sedentary lifestyle far outweighs risks covid. That's slot people Turd mentality thinks herd immunity works sans vaccine without killing 10s thousands more. It’s sociopathic. Wait minute....in country isolate result. 

This pure madness. Except countless people would die. never got there.

Because never planned first place, despite terrible press seems time high Norway excellent contact tracing.... 400 mentioned amount people ICU? 7 them?

So basically, compared population, 7-10 days behind Sweden's curve. whatever want, sub cesspool people think moral high ground. Yelling rooftops they’re saving world, don’t agree you’re cold hearted trump apologist. Live life. you’re social circle willing take risk you’re nothing wrong, ones aren’t stay home IMO. Cool. Hey Fatass Trump, get 12 around clock dedicated docs nurses well expensive experimental treatments tax payer’s dime like did? layman, come understand problem medicine much find something works virus replication, deliver without body process interfering. Yes, nobody wears masks job work would say swedes care follow guidelines all. reported cases haircutters directly exposed infected customers, since strong hygiene mask use, get infected never spread shops.

and superspreaders... :( Americans felt way schools July, leader's [push open turned educating students desperate last resort disease control valiant act political defiance. faaaaiirrr. Yea, may highlighting people take infectious diseases seriously vs people don't. 🤔 Oh. I'm sorry quoted president stupid cunt. least ~~patriot~~ **jingoistic nationalist** That's bullshit. flu shot free belong group vaccine recommended(aged 60+, risk persons, healthcare workers, others, see site rki). Additionally, insurers pay even target group, choice insurer generally true.

Finally, importantly, even close enough vaccines Germany give even half population shot. ""The others"" mean anything. Responses within Nordic countries vary widely. Denmark always strictest one far, still has. inconclusive test tested next day campus, (came back negative) kinda nerve racking though ""Why Americans expect government basic competence get mad doesn't??!?!?!!???"" Oh yeah, meant table curfews etc. draft proposal shutting things end November. actually didnt cut travel China. 

It banned Chinese nationals traveling mainland. could transfer thro8gh Hong Kong. could canadian citizen flying LA China. 

You could also fly Europe. Like Italy also hit hard time. ban there, shockingly. 


It's almost like accomplished nothing banning specific group people arriving US. 

I wonder word that. Maybe, many things influencing outbreak. think correct strategy isnt  all. was, different regions country would results. strategy all. countries far know see extreme differences different areas country. Depends countries Europe. UK number people ICU 3,000, first wave right 1,000. Belgium still slightly first wave total ICU hospitalisations although expected overtake numbers soon. Italy still well number ICU first wave. worst hit othets right Europe. Obviously could change depending much cases continue rise lot Americans given seems. There's much individual government wont even enforce something basic mask mandate. live Victoria, Aus second outbreak Premier enforced strict lockdown led people taking issue seriously. Almost everyone really concerned felt like needed bit get Covid back control. We've completely flattened curve gone 700 cases day almost none. Thank you. struggling global scale. Hang good soul - get thru this. wish refreshed marriage healing family. kids recover full bloom one day soon. Here's different website covering news English:
 Mommy, emperor clothes! assumption Western thing much it’s global pandemic thing. people don’t handle existential dread well. either piece shit idiot (albeit useful one).

Why both? Sorry hear, hope quick complete recovery. looking items right things harder get year. Normally put queue based ordered. sudden stuff ""coming faster"" im pretty sure theyre jumping ahead queue. staying active empirically worse catching covid you’re young, everyone afford home gym equipment. shock. 

This probably unpopular opinion, form lockdown required getting control. Ideally let businesses stay open kids go school (if accommodate online, it) whilst keeping everyone else inside month supporting industries suffer without customers (restaurants, hospitality etc).

Can’t believe people still aren’t taking seriously... No, quit shifting blame. Accept people rotten inside out. imaginary forcing hand. ""Russell’s team also used data gathered large COVID-19 outbreak *Diamond Princess* cruise ship early February estimate IFR China.

Back July, Victoria similar figure Europe. Whereas Europe lax measures, Victoria enacted strict one. results clear. Well, flush 15 times /s Republicans said ""Fuck little Jimmy, let starve."" happened many times, unless job, confront people? public?? gonna convince way. think that’s 40 percent population says it’s hoax waiting reality show it’s real serious. takes enormous amount cognitive effort live world two different realities populace. think everyone taken seriously beginning would relieved times it’s bad feared. still want locked down.

Corona kaka don’t know numbers you’ll look yourself, Stockholm Sweden whole significantly first second generation immigrants. surprised immigrants saw Helsinki years ago didn’t think much Oslo since kid then.

I’ve seen articles saying immigrants listen government coronavirus recommendations less, socialize bigger groups live smaller apartments since generally poorer. factors lead bigger part demographics getting infected virus. Since big share elderly care home workers immigrants, combined lot factors lead virus getting elderly care homes contributed Sweden’s high death toll. 

The age distribution cities though, can’t see wouldn’t. meeting today, yes. Results probably communicated tomorrow. Hope live long enough enjoy it! hold summer. warm weather get rid it. This. this. *struggle* *sacrifice* results.

Dear god please go vote people you’re US call trapped nightmare/toxic/abusive/bad relationships/situation, kinda know right/best thing get it, no, it. intervention actually get it, look back, say 'omg could stupid? can't believe see bad/toxic relationship/situation was. could blind? could continued/lived like long? wrong me?'

Do Americans like come 2021? Education day care brainwashing institution become good pliable employee. need pretend like year 2 school ""stunt devolpement children"" **“we think terms reduction viral burden, it’s likely molnupiravir superior remdesivir,”** 

Shouldn't difficult Remdesivir pretty useless. Hopefully stock pump piece never know dicks FYI editorial far conclusive. gotta tell pandemic Well then. 500k week is, without exponential rates, 71k per day infected 7 days. every person gives two people, expect 100k people infected per day tomorrow. Given incubation periods prior symptoms showing, thus testing, almost definitely likely 100k+ per day already exceeded. One treatments involves giant plastic bubble around head. like plastic bubbles cloth. mean again? implies stopped :p Read *The Deliberate Dumbing America*, revised abridged edition Wow! guys get Christmas celebrations air?! That’s magical! Meadows said we're own. Doctors sign numerous forms stating would desert would always follow state's orders etc upon initial employment.

I need shirt says that
“the next 4 years...” What’s demented think there’s worldwide conspiracy discredit America’s president, literally millions people secretly know virus fake working together. always thought screen every home. Spying would require government decide put listening device home 1984 already there. That's thing think that's missing though, technology thought screens them. Ahhh, one people.

Even lockdown, caution needed time. would rather worried making rent retail grocery employee fear losing life covid every day. Especially negligence stupidity we've seen essential businesses. *allowed company* wear masks first covid case. 

I feel like ya'll clue actually fighting life entails. Homelessness serious challenge, one fought teens. ICU worse.

I respect fact money issues housing issues incredibly stressful traumatic, respect mindset person thinks way compares getting exposed covid.

I personally know one highest ranked MDs NYC. Anybody common sense NYC knows famous hospital, one head dawgs there. personally told me, sometime around July remember correctly, virus way overblown, need live life, people get die, shouldnt close schools. known person almost 20 years utmost respect him. flabbergasted.

No, didn’t. opposite problem. locked three people dog. I’d LOVE completely alone next lockdown. Even data correct, clearly much better world. Hi, please refrain posting out-of-date information - post 2 weeks old. ~~Concentration~~ COVID camps know used say really symptom.

Who says that? definitely symptom. CDC published chart covid-19 symptom prevalence among convenience sample patients. “Rihnoreah” aka runny nose, listed 45-50% covid patients. data point, settled science yet. see studies tell us. That's also lie lol. Christian going circles know that. Plus know Evangelicals support trump recently formed alliance call hypocrisy trump ""Christians"" support him? 
Idk ppl try blame christians everything though say christians better non christians. Ppl bitter salty. one claimed masks 100% effective preventing infections one said people need distance physically they're wearing mask.

Masks helping reduce amount viral particles carried projections. two people wear them, rate transmission certain conditions decreases.

Trump undermining truth every opportunity getting people killed daily. like he's getting people killed says cure, appointed son law head task force tasked fighting PPE ventilator shortages, undermines institutions whose job fight pandemics experts working them. becoming like Maoist Struggle Sessions.

New cases 3-4,000 back then. ready triple-digit deaths Texas weeks, unless drastic measures taken (and even then, might late).

Imagine living new town, single needing make friends meet people. That's extremely difficult fewer opportunities go out, opportunities everyone masked. saying wear mask, recognizing rather belittling sacrifice - like condoms HIV - probably better Public Health strategy trying build compliance Again, prove it.

Fuck, go downtown Colorado Springs Denver count many actually following CDC/NIH guidelines. 

Don't try bullshit common sense; work.  agree. source, seems like sudden backtrack confidence whole thing, effectiveness controlling pandemic, concerns supply. 

This one scratching head. Oooooh got downvotes pointing hypocrisy. Nice. Yeah, stupid, right? 

I feel sorry Evers sometimes. clear day *wants* reimpose lockdown, even though cannot. rightfully so, considering winter coming cases rise pretty much everywhere (even areas like New York supposedly ""herd immunity"" now; wink wink). 

Unfortunately, however, restrictions already ruled unconstitutional nasty federal courts... ugh, politics getting way science again. completely understand might little reluctant increase restrictions again; politically, could put hot water, cost support people. point. guy saying america thing stopping china Russia, pointing fuck HK I'm pretty certain got placebo. can’t rely low population density “interacting less,” though. people going work together, going church together, Sunday dinners together...covid going spread. you’re unwilling take steps mitigate spread, world would stop spreading? normal viruses. uncommon, normal. president said "" We're turning corner"", meant. vertical corner...a cliff, speak. tremendous banner People don’t understand it’s place gamble people’s lives. I’ve heard, “well, it’s time go you’ll go”. 

I’m high risk. keep public interactions minimum. I’m part. hear healthcare workers say kind things infuriates me. world coming to? what

it either  Sorry, it’s going take lot pain death Wyoming South Dakota North Dakota Montana take pandemic seriously. literally prospective vector disease could “killing” people result, pandemic pandemic (the flu kills tens thousands every year, example!). existence harmful environment natural world! Every time take roads make congested increase likelihood fatal accident!

You see, take logic turn situation never leave house again, maybe shouldn’t even alive environmental effects. APPROVE IT! Yes, cases rised despite Tier lockdown. heard make new Tier 4 lockdown? Soldiers similar concept gargling salt water sore throat?  lot people fortunate ""bubble"" make tragic reality others face seem kind remote.

I think biggest issue. Many people, you, unable understand even recognize hardships others unless directly affects them. something goes beyond pandemic areas life, pandemic definitely force made noticeable issue *my* life. work sports broadcasting hit pretty hard pandemic, girlfriend's real change hours changed. affected everyone different way.

That said, good support system place ever tight position, know could ask help could stop stubborn. Sadly, many people opportunity. even talking about? Look Italy. locked like crazy spiking per pop basis higher US? virus seem care lock not. US counted unemployed benefits run out.  would interesting testing infrastructure March April see bad surges really northeast imagine numbers massive likely surmise higher seeing now. want spare economy may backfire hard lockdown christmas may needed. apologise clearer. 

I meant add sentence campaign also created mandated hat wearing primary schools many areas - ""No hat play"". mean imply mandate adults society used idea wearing hats health reasons - case, mandate specifically children point holds. believe sides offer arguments statics back point

Just finished reading 2 articles, first one based France (could European country) Covid running control.

Than read latest article Lockdownskeptics showing evidence Covid hospital numbers running lower normal flu season. Hallway medicine happens every winter UK far year hospitals seem escaping it. 

Asked another forum politely got told GFY

Thanks could close restaurants, people would sue say ""First prove need closed"", courts would say ""that's true"", restaurants would allowed re-open, they'd contact tracing prove restaurants spread virus, they'd make law people would say ""It illegal last time, let's overthrow government"".

When virus spreading former school (Germany), school closed again.

There guideline eat restaurants visit party. People *that* freely free will. Yes, wealth consolidation inequality increase this. No, wrong. According Reddit experts, US country spiking terrible leadership. guess what, ""rounding corner"" means????? Also, uh, B cells, actually produce antibodies people worried about.

Remember weeks ago everyone went apeshit reinfections turns reinfections indeed appear rare?

It's shame, scientists correct prepare worst case scenario reinfections common immunity shortlived - media, usual, taking worst case scenario presenting reality that's gets clicks.

If thing climate change instead effectively opposite, maybe we'd get real shit done. Yeah Canada know someone claims panic attacks wears mask (so not). avoid going except work also work (sigh...) least.

But skier wears sorts race coverings skiing. apparently okay. Population density country matter much (see Sweden example). matters urbanisation population density metropolitan areas. 

Within countries see spread larger cities less spread country side. Well children allowed outside school without hat break times. someone, then, explain articles mean say “ABC Vaccine produces significant immune response adults.”

These headlines circulating months. Doesn’t lead people believe “immune” higher probability protected severe illness? holidays? radical people state hadn’t threatened life, maybe she’d still public eye. still serves office, public role Seeing EU countries go various lockdowns fascinating American something neither party proposing here. pretty much table unless start seeing bodies street. told someone today cure already President got better covid. Ozzy Drix didn’t go bullshit could forget immune system works hope NJ government paying businesses close! rounding dat corner tho. worries peeps lmao fuck orange fuck Gotta get mask social distancing compliance order keep economy running. cultures touchy feely gotta change awhile.

I've working throughout entire pandemic wear masks stores social distance state saw 2nd 3rd surge. WTF ya'll there. state population density 622 per square mile, 5th densely populated state. 

WHY WEARING MASKS! That's single cheapest effective method fight back besides saying home couple years living inheritance. Queues George Bush Except Snowden proved government storing information every american back 2012. Sure one sitting watching time data stored someone literally search name get everything you. personal email web activity. 8 years ago now. knows now, especially growth AI tech. People sick tired lockdowns movement restrictions.

But absolutely necessary, need economic devastation brought forth strategy proven damaging virus itself.

No. Public health economics go hand-in-hand. cannot strong bustling economy without fewer COVID cases. cases surging deaths rising, decide reopen anyway, benefit economy Public health experts telling civilians stay home holidays visit relatives. work!! It’s going strengthen people’s resolve go defiance recommendations.

Um, yeah, *guess*. think alternative, i.e. Instead emphasis placed counter treatments means preventing worst Covid symptoms taking place. retrospective study came saying 80% people hospital Covid deficient Vitamin D!!

Vitamin supplement to, replacement for, lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccines, mitigation strategies. recommending Vitamin mean take away one strategies, completely give people chance something positive change reducing likelihood ever go hospital catch Covid.

No, think that's problem. *not* question things worded, ""negative"", on. might *seem* like ""do this"" would effective messaging ""don't this"", unfortunately, not. Why? Remember ""wear mask"" went? Yea, sure, get think that. statistical viewpoint, dont agree. leave :) wait order needs changed extra that. (US) legal business greater 500 employees exhaust pto leave remainder quarantine time unpaid someone testing positive COVID? kind civic community trust completely blown. Heard fatality come dumbest part people think going countries? Everyone's playing along screw trump? insane Worldometer reported 212k deaths October 1st. Currently, they’re reporting 232k. looks like estimates 20,000 deaths October right money. We’re rounding corner

- big fat orange loser knowledge families part bubble postseason. protests full asshole customers pretending wanted go back work way favorite places spend money would reopen could go back horrible Sunday morning church crowd. ""I stupid"" average age corona death average life expectancy. fair ask young people sacrifice livelihoods, futures, mental health social lives extend lives already lived full lives enjoyed best quality life history fucked environment us? I'm willing make trade, millions others either. feeld bad restaurant owners cared hygienic rules invested measures like plexi glass walls, outdoor tents on. think third close forever lockdown announced. rounded curve, ended shitsville. people talk ""economy"", always ""not able get haircut"", sometimes able feed kids worse. reminder, guess.

These go hand hand. people mentioned work 5+ months? cut hair. pour drinks. serve food. something else either shut hindered much longer make living it.

That many people sub understand. people wanting go BBQ getting haircut... things allow huge portions society pay rent. hair cuts? mortgage payment month....  Fucking bull, numbers low almost election day go up. Fake fake fake, libs trying blame trump LOL assume headline means ""patient numbers typical winter season"" support masks healthy people yet? Deaths rising exponential :( Soon daily rate welcome r/collapse Yup, viral infections trigger auto-immune disorders certain people. 

This part bothersome see people otherwise healthy brushing big deal get it. “no big deal” (not called others would) virus healthy active teen meant months chronic fatigue likely culprit years later dealing issues. still active relatively healthy need daily medication easily things go way balance careful. 

What many don’t realize don’t even get particularly ill initial virus end auto immune issues. Someone mild virus symptoms end significant auto immune issues later. 1. saying now, six months ago? seen data? seems odds tentative good news emerging sources.
2. Even vaccine nothing reduce infections, significantly reduced severe disease, could reduce social distancing significantly return kind normality — although would accept near-permanence restrictions keep, lasting/sterilising immunity.
3. comments vaccine manufacturing capacity concerning - gone ""manufacturing billions doses risk"" ""we enough"" really way around.

Obviously right temper unrealistic expectations — now, primarily UK countries access data. lifting weights months worse disease leave permanent organ scarring... TIL guess Thats like HK's numbers gained one day compared 10 months Agree posters seems rather pragmatic approach everyone truly trusted quarantine test prior. don’t know contact he’s her, you? MLB bubble work? literally sleeping room wife eating meals her? completely isolated outside? assume players stricter rules families don’t know sure. they’d kissing daily yea agree doesn’t matter specifically Explain. Seems like new GOP doesn’t actually engage kind discussion. make one line talking points walk away challenged. know facts don’t support claims. 
It’s even frustrating like used be. motivates even make sure everyone know votes. It’s risk tolerance. Probably would better girlfriend, can’t make work financially, make call. Peru lockdown numbers rising despite that. way I’d believe Please, Mr President, much winning. embarrassing winning much. stop winning now? Please? mean, really. think better young, healthy population largely unaffected go get infected virus burns thing start over. ""Courthouse Only"" thing. ""tHaNk SeRvIcE""

\- Americans screaming essential employees

But seriously, thanks. said lockdowns solution numbers one, last solution. condoning slightest people exempt wearing masks various medical reasons may visible. Don’t confront people wearing them.

Again though, actions terrible pretty much sum mindset people choose wear reason to. essential oils theraputic/sub-clinical effects. Typically either scent diffuser treatment headaches, think one works topical anti-inflammatory.

Unfortunately huns made finding *actual* information basically impossible they're basically trying pass alchemy. Look done broke them! Iran Mexico excess deaths. Chancellor Angela Merkel announced Wednesday evening restaurants, hotels cultural sector would completely closed entire month November. people way older 2 year old still don’t care virus ones making hard nurses. It’s like companies put statements bleach products WON’T save Covid. truly people dumb common sense articles like still made. mean pretty typical school too.

When high school, mom would tell would allow stay home felt cruddy. usually making schoolwork difficult going school day.

Usually making test quiz required stay school. difficult rode bus home (until got car 17). figuring ride much stress about.  definitive evidence. Thats seem get. cant make claim long term damage assumption n=12 study case studies. Nothing peer reviewed.

Experts arent talking long covid they'd talking asses. Dude nothing said changed scientists/data proven. Reinfection shockingly common sorry  15% NCAA players myocarditis, Eduardo Rodriguez, Red Sox pitcher well. Myocarditis side effect virus. often cause death hear perfectly healthy teen dies playing sport. Depending company, transfer different country (at least mine pretty easily). Exactly. isn’t ethical issue arguments coming sides fence.

People see effects two eyes. still choose ignore see, people won’t. 13,571 cases today, that's equal 380,000 US cases  addition, Bourla noted independent data monitoring committee yet conduct interim review whether vaccine safe. planned point interim review 32 study participants infected symptomatic COVID-19. “We don’t 32 events right now,” Bourla said. also said “extremely unlikely” efficacy data would publicized November 3—not avoid politics, would take least week fully analyze data. pay babysit random jerk-off follow simple advice extra limited time. Fuck that. Yeah. kinda data world. Countries faced mild winters alongside equator line surge cases reopened. However, Australia New Zealand shut everything essential businesses refused reopened low cases. 
Then Europe shut everything opened things back up. refused shut things theyre overwhelmed. Really? narrative hearing week two ago America could done like Europe anti-masker assholes.

Edit: let's honest, neither us idea rates compliance like everywhere world. see cases rising assume must lack compliance, praxeology extra steps. Remove whole comment thread responded fucking twat problem is, method says ""this many per day population same!"" misleading population same. nature inflated number, even mathematically equivalent. 

I'm tired arguing. determined right, tell nothing say change mind. need start “shun” thing people. 

“You unclean, shun you” walk away them. 😁 Thank you. There's many people claiming ""doctors"" ""nurses"" spreading disinformation obvious demonstrating even rudimentary knowledge things talking about. unclear people really medical professionals need people credentials people trust countering this.

It's frustrating used work R&amp;D lab developing diagnostic tests, including tests coronaviruses ended going Defense sector unrelated work better pay. credentials throw around certainly know enough able tell people pushing false information subject.  electoral votes brain. correct. federal government getting behind states supporting national lockdown I’m talking about. delusion liberty

I walk white house, tell trump go f\*\*\* himself, get legally married husband pray Allah proceed post social media, send papers show TV absolutely zero fear legally persecuted government, fact would probably lauded bravery. **THAT** liberty. Please though, tell US delusional liberty? people voice opposition behavior? Well that's right liberty freedom one street. We’ll see. think you’re underestimating numbers spring regardless far we’ve come treatments else come with. test catches cases spring. would suggest lot cases spring well June. note, Denmark tests double Sweden does. Right pretty much amount cases per capita Denmark. means it’s probably slightly worse Sweden. 

Personally, I’m fan lifted restrictions 70+ right cases increasing. raising limit 50 300 people culture/sports. should’ve done summer. swede I’m surprised bureaucratic Sweden is. likely sit decision month two able put formally. 

There already reports virus getting elderly homes. Hopefully curbed early Measures guidelines they’ve already put there. retainer fee though, that's least cool $500,000 Damn US fire wrong ways take guess combination factors: - age majority infected trending lower (carelessness, essential workers, etc) - therapeutics (steroids primarily) improved overall understanding treat symptoms general course disease improved - deaths typically lag couple weeks (though death rate appear lower previously) - testing: still don’t effective testing regime US results often late properly isolate/contact trace availability get tested increased capturing mild cases

yah mean specifically beginning August months ago.

The US big spike April/May, things went June. things started climb Texas Arizona everybody said ""Here comes second wave! hospitals overflooded!"" didnt happen.

And death rate going past 2 - 3 months kind maybe starting rise although cases rising since beginning August.

But overall, US deaths lower back April/May .. also significantly lower 2-3 months ago everybody panicking South.

I dont think treatments policies changed much 3 months, right? 

But somehow death rates much better beginning August. Actually, new cases new deaths better beginning August. Gud job keep going yall! :) Pinging users sake picking argument appropriate behavior sub. Well, would hope parent child interviewed separately preferably psychologist given accurate information potential side effects. But, know, really 100% sure happening even legit source says is? cutting power cord save money/power, solve wifi issue?  counter tylenol, hydration, rest helped get headaches. sure bad are, mine severe. found Daily Double!! pew pa pew pew pew pew this, don’t mind explaining? cannot done US government anyhow. constitutional. state order lockdown itself. looking for, where? 8 million people. Florida 21,000,000.

So Florida's +4,000 double Canada's +1,700 yesterday. Canada's population 37,590,000. likely sick wrong think would change opinions. Especially comes rewarding donors friends administration. Well first off, cannot find saying exact quote google source - links back video posted Washington Examiner *not* say that. sources misled you, didn’t cite source. 

He didn’t say misled. Again, misleading requires *know*. unclear 1. could spread asymptomatically 2. Cloth masks work. fact, quote, doesn’t talk cloth masks all. 

But think time didn’t recommend masks - thought could spread showing symptoms, relatively easy completely prevent spreading virus - isolate symptoms. easy thing detect counter. 2: didn’t know cloth masks worked, *would* recommended wear N95 surgical masks, were, like said, short supply. 

Health officials data time suggest masks *minimal* benefit every day person, helpful healthcare workers. knew know would recommended everyone wear cloth masks supply got handled.

They didn’t mislead public, wrong. don’t give fucking statement.

The CDC make statements, don’t luxury silent - hundreds millions listening them.

Yes, agree would reasonable include it, although think author trying highlight inaccuracy belief Sweden somehow managed well, even economically, avoiding lock downs. Truth is, except March/April, Sweden similar, lower, rates social mobility compared Nordic neighbours. others noted, government “recommendation” probably closely followed Sweden actual legal mobility restrictions countries. find hilarious Swedes Americans gloating

We are? broad strokes colors painting with. fair countries socialized medicine would identify people mental illness try get help.....

Herd immunity come 🤣 idea common reinfection is, might changing time. Covid cases world! WOOOOO!!! USA NUMBER ONE!!!! be. US government authority domestic level. states can. beat it! best guess people symptoms/had contact simply get tested went work instead want isolated. can't throw number cases try make case. need compare US countries / continents. **I'll you:**

Europe 200k cases one day October 27th. USA 74k day. 

US also given 80 million covid tests date. Europe administered 60 million covid tests, give way tests less cases. Yeah US really sucks containing this. Nobody live lives without comforts. can't expect spend every penny somehow end comfortable retirement. food, 100% chance death. Can't believe I'm getting downvoted hyping subs poster child

I prefer call captain obvious Sacrificing young old. can’t think better metaphor ‘pandemic’. Trump announced pandemic claiming victory COVID-19 administrations accomplishments.. wish making up. :/ cute think United States country deal this. Take look back European history see shit happens quite bit developed nations, happens people free speak minds voice wrong opinions often right ones. also notice ""quiet"" countries comes political issues extreme authoritarian rule, tend fall quite bit harder, far bloodier, democratic nations... None surprising anyone completed even basic coursework world history. BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany impose **emergency month-long lockdown includes closure restaurants, gyms theatres reverse spike coronavirus cases risks overwhelming hospitals**, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday.

“We need take action now,” said, adding situation “very serious”.

**Effective Nov. 2, private gatherings limited 10 people maximum two households. Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, pools gyms shut concerts cancelled**.

**People asked travel private, non-essential reasons, overnight stays hotels available necessary business trips**.

Merkel said goal limit economic impact measures bare minimum keep schools daycare centres open.

Germany widely praised keeping infection death rates many neighbours first phase crisis midst second wave. Cases rose 14,964 464,239 last 24 hours, Germany’s infections diseases agency, Robert Koch Institute, said Wednesday.

Deaths jumped 85 10,183, fuelling fears health system Merkel warned could hit breaking point infections continue spiral.

“Our health system still cope challenge today, speed infections reach limits capacity within weeks,” Merkel said.

Merkel added **health authorities able trace origin 25% outbreaks**, means difficult say aspects social life driving second wave. mean it’s diet???!!! /s Pandemic Began? Like TV show something? I've supplimenting winter years already due SAD. taken daily year upping dose winter cases area. day long bike rides sun lift mood! advised first wave

At least Swedish doctors given steroids severely ill patients since early days stops population gets point starts actually following guidelines reduce spread, like masks large gatherings handled Japan WW2, held Vietnam completely different generations Americans. nation longer full farm boys lean men ready take fight. Half population would extremely hard time making boot camp..... America plenty places never went lockdown economies still tatters turns people actually stupid reckless enough continue lives everything fine, dining out, going movies, going malls, etc., middle active global pandemic. even are, COVID cases quickly spike stay stupid long.

The pandemic problem ignoring solution. You’re right 2020 needs police shootings. people spend lot money cars ride information superhighway make great efforts seen them

plenty people end talking people there's source, mostly speculation current past numbers coworker said yesterday, verbatim. you, said, comply stay home, spread grandma grandpa.

You're talking thousands extra deaths. Case numbers irrelevant. Ding ding ding. That's also bother passing another stimulus bill election. complete shit show WI. Every time Evers tries anything, Republicans throw fit get courts overturn it. That's interesting theory even researched yet. used wearing school uniforms whilst Americans aren't. wonder well compared western countries. government announce 2-3 month lockdown. Instead, say 4 weeks reviewed constantly. happened spring lockdowns extended least (and countries three times) France home country, wish could visit family year holidays, already summer... get crap together want see beautiful France Twitter replies omfg Well unlike US, they're actively seeking find solutions spikes surges. 

Meanwhile across pond, we're sitting there, letting virus flare everywhere, nothing stop it. Even so, reading give less excuse mad it. ""sensational"" justify ire response T's peacocking around it.

It's also considered unethical list something unfinished accomplishment fields (social work, counseling, psychiatry, medicine, name few). Foci Absurd, it. point lockdowns last resorts it’s bad economy, people get sick them, won’t 100% effective non authoritarian states. said, things get bad enough need lockdown. data quite obvious regard: harsher lockdown dramatically virus cases drop (look Wuhan; look Spain first time around; look Israel last month; look northeast US). avoid lockdown health care system jeopardy collapsing that’s see massive deaths fair estimate make 10,000 people could die reported cases still need time determine accurate number. use pure correlation people catch disease yes number could high 10k use numbers people actually show symptoms need treatment number could lower. tell united states, claimed iraq WMD declared war iraq Ethiopia also done 12,000 tests per capita 1 million vs. 42,000 per million Philippines blew testing early on, blocked localities scaling upmtheirmown tests, pretended contained letting COVID come Europe spread silently among vulnerable populations Northeast. Then, blew managing supply chain, mask initiatives, testing uninsured, national contact tracing, sowing disinformation public guidance ostensibly meant keep people safe. pro-virus administration making infinitely worse. take 400IU day stomach issues. Yes.

The fact work healthcare makes statements egregious. Yes. really choice continue work customers decide want ignore rules putting everyone else risk starve death working think better treatments mitigation measures come play. better treatments a) fewer people ICUs/hospitals, b) people leaving ICU/hospital sooner. One biggest issues wrt healthcare system long people stuck hospital due covid go in. lot people needing hospitalization *and* people staying hospital long periods time...that’s things get really *really* bad really quickly. 

And comes mitigation measures, think it’s good remember it’s zero-sum game. people taking mitigation measures better, obviously, even people wearing masks people staying home much possible, that’s still going better literally everyone going business weren’t novel pandemic. 

Basically (I believe), you’re seeing benefits getting slammed covid right beginning. Better treatments people like taking seriously. ‘merica killing it! Sending positive vibes recovery, I’m sorry happened hope everything coming gives guidelines rather theoretical. Sadly, good percentage population comply simple guidelines, make almost useless. sound government wants shutdown/lockdown entire country. forced making decision partly government slow react, partly people comply rules. ever say wear mask socially distance? You’re making many false assumptions.

I don’t think stay home orders working obviously they’re not. It'll week two states GOP effectively blocked mail ballots.   
   
Go vote, distance wear mask, y'all. Well, think alternative lock down. People notice rise cases take measures anyway, causing hardship businesses stock market would've happened *with* lockdown. lot objectors opposed lockdowns think lockdowns *really bad* economy, reality *virus* that's bad economy *lockdowns*. fallacious logic amounts little crude scapegoating, interests ""liberty"" something.

It's shown many places, control virus? benefit economy. Given plot kidnap DeWine reported week, doubt we'll see enforcement those. This. point this.. rising massive amounts (U.S.) possibly controllable amounts test trace. 

To put simply: 
Germany - 12 deaths per 100k vs U.S.- 69 deaths per 100k Lmao well heard save anyone. delays problem. Bro im literally talking pandemic telling people go gym. personal trainer, know sorts gym people industry 8 years.

I never thought would see something like again... A-S-S parents look schools babysitters  must work Ministry Truth!

You realize Orwell open vocal Democratic Socialist, yeah? essay 'Why Write' “Every line serious work written since 1936 written, directly indirectly, totalitarianism democratic Socialism” Probably lot people communicating going polls. 

Just thought IRS currently ~9 months behind main question social democratic country Sweden became poster boy right wing media. universal health care? social safety nets? sick leave? many questions. It’ll worse winter it’ll covid plus influenza plus respiratory infections become prevalent time year. 

This easiest flu season modern history. Everything prevents Covid also prevents flu, flu lot harder pass compared Covid. effective way fighting virus. Daily deaths Sweden low months. Maybe France follow example. encouraged eat restaurants encouraged avoid them.

Its complicated that. People essentially trust government. People *really* trust government tell want hear. aware France miles worse USA atm account population difference? means 90% population going get arrested 😳 amazing many old people see go out. Normally even wearing masks. like want die. understand generation taking seriously. parents 60s went vacation driving across US camper. irritating staff enforce rules. Haha haha. month two ago, state maybe 50% compliance. I’d see half people store wearing masks. days it’s much closer 10%. state peaking right now. Thank god n95s now. Good act early. main hospital 20 covid hospitalizations. peak April 300. Hopefully gets contained bursts open like Europe Strange. I'm Stockholm wear mask every time take public transport never gotten stares it. lot people Stockholm wearing masks. Many government scientists, UK beyond, indicated prolonged contact indoors without masks potent situation spreading virus. Added that, settings pubs restaurants bring people different households together, therefore furthering potential spreading virus.

I'm saying government UK elsewhere fault. fault. also obvious people going pub even can. saw 350+ deaths yesterday news UK, earth would ignore that? doesn't. That's asking. Closing stables horse bolted, broken leg, taken glue factory glue used kid. 


If serious ""trying fight virus"" would done stuff long long long long time ago,not 50,000 cases day. Wow, sounds pretty ideal circumstances. wife called morning way work. stopped gas station eight people one wearing mask.

No one enforcing anymore. Republicans shout lock governor trying make us take reasonable precautions.

People suck. line months ago different tone permanent brain damage even mild covid cause, dismiss that?!&lt; said seemed like going road Florida Texas across south months ago. thought would see health system collapse states. Truly.

This honestly take much reports. Yes, hospital rates surge virus hits new places... calm move next place. exceptions, system held fine, treatments improving every day.

I get it. virus serious people dying it. heading toward major collapse like sub wants be. We're 7th month doom gloom predictions total collapse right around corner entire time. 

I'll believe see it. So....do want see text not? See, also live Colorado, told Colorado DNC sacrifices economy would need made, i.e., Polis currently doing. 

I'm thinking much wuss actually see truth. prefer play Football Politics instead facing reality Endemic. Yeah, mean like real lockdown. Yep going US. kills majority elderly minorities anyway. Listerine water iodine

&amp;#x200B;

for bacterial infections i've also done salt water work retail report Ohioans it. Mask usage down, people taking kids everywhere again, half people wearing masks wearing correctly. There’s absolutely downside taking Vitamin D.

Uh, *ever* say was?

I'm worried Vitamin ""not working"". *am* worried about, however, use Vitamin sort ""key"" ""returning normal"" something like that, it'll give people false sense security, making think they're protected they're really not. 

You take Vitamin *instead of* socially distancing, wearing masks, getting vaccine. take Vitamin *in addition to* socially distancing, wearing masks, getting vaccine. secret Belgium? terrible handling virus? released state health department today go back work. still symptoms (stopped up, coughing, taste/smell, sore throat). 
I feel well enough go back think. wanted check make sure correct- go back work even though continued symptoms? (No fever diarrhea) Wow.

Baseball pulled 'Indy rolling stone door grabbing hat final possible moment' pulling season. 

Congrats LA Dodgers fans. (Yankees fuckin mess, deserve zero, sorry NYC/NJ Peeps) German government covered payrolls first lockdown.

Yeah not. iT’s tEstinG!! many asymptomatic vs mild symptoms vs critical? many deaths? arent irrelevant.... “muh rightz!” People US don’t care controlling virus, want go get beer. It’s insane. (And honestly disease like Covid, super strict quarantine order probably realistic. What’s terrifying thinking people would act highly contagious (more) highly deadly disease going around) know german. think mask sufficient bus(that supposed maximum ~50 people inside) moving like 80 people leaving seats empty rubbing bodies standing next other. know system already overloaded *almost* like weaponized point. yet figured people exist? stupid fucking comment... rough though. 4 weeks taking half Americans work median income 200 billion dollars. live consumption based economy. money either needs borrowed central banks taken workers. day, enough slow things bit. normal pre-covid times, loved go bar friends July, January, I'd much rather stay home playing video games. I've lived DC NYC adult life, places get cold occasionally snow, anywhere super extreme. I’m getting masters degree come May. wild time graduate. Cheers us. Great, i'm saying Gargle gargle gargle loud Posted another place anyway, tired Sweden politicized US. 

I seen american liberals basically hoping Swedes die prove concervatives wrong. Im hoping youre like youre tone bit, ""gotcha""? 

Why wish Swedes die? 

Just explain Sweden lot, heard immunity strategy, life same. And, concervatives want less repressive volontary response also change country core. I.e higher taxes rich, public health care, employee rights etc.

Its like left right agree Sweden didnt anything. wrong. fighting Sweden good bad. Fact 15 countries worse (more count excess deaths) despite hard lockdowns. lot lot better Sweden hard lockdowns without.

Just clear consider left, im dissapointed american left taking opportunity turn concervatives arguments them. So...much...winning.../s Eastern Europe barely got hit hard first wave...then summer happened people stopped believing masks. -\_- There's widespread testing better part 4-5 months cases going now. spike supposed get due testing availability time ago, waved passed by. 

These spikes purely people idiots. Deaths high better grasp keep virus bay however mortality rate old compromised still higher say flu. I'm re-reading right first time 20+ years. Fucking terrifying far we've come towards world. almost certainly true respiratory lung throat viruses, though especially useful practical slowing pandemic. honestly sounds pretty safe me, long people actually quarantine. sounds like pretty lonely trying hard find safe way meaningful get together. judge hard. know, I've seen photos reason reaction claustrophobia.  I'm sure would different sick but... Come US. 

See actual failure looks like. year would thought joke. fair Sweden, rise alarming, far numbers significantly lower EU countries. Whether purely current approach they're simply behind curve (as case also Germany) hard tell. figure? Many people comments said heard similar things going around areas. People don’t believe science feel wearing small scrap cloth beginning tyranny even though they’re global pandemic, allegedly minds, would surely take steps avoid deal things like shutdowns keeping things inaccurate inconveniences them. form protest see government intrusion lives. yes much see people screwing rest us believe Covid-19 real liberal hoax discredit Trump going suffer consequences it. Look definition rich. like trying get property trespassing.

Taking phone isn’t get leave. makes sense. really called police wouldn’t leave. Things look better stop testing. HK couple dozen cases everyday. Taiwan mystery, somehow exporting cases countries local confirmed. wait trying stop crazies getting Black Friday. Wait till January. posters thread pat back mask wearing now, don’t forget get vaccine, still need wear mask community spread eliminated.  don’t think many people actually comprehend coming winter. Literally. brainwashed cannot see all. Sad, really.

We power educate ourselves, independent main stream media constant feeding/lying/manipulating/psychological warfare, etc Gov. real information since January. sort dig.

Stay safe. importantly, stay educated make educated decisions it’s time need do, regardless “they” say when. Stay steps ahead. served us very, well many fronts since January. Settled case law (Zogenix, Inc. v. Patrick) makes constitutionally questionable. FDA approves vaccine, anyone within United States able buy sell regardless committees governor appoints particular state. States ex-post authority ex-ante (like vaccine approval) preempted federal law. interacting FDA California medical device regulators knowing instructions put together run, say FDA really institutional capacity properly audit vetting vaccine. would terrible partisan state governor deny delay citizens important vaccine unlawfully disparage cast suspicion vaccine FDA approval score cheap shot guy side political aisle. use state residents pawn political game. anti-mask coworker never wears seat belt, even drive hundreds miles. two young children. someone money doesn’t make rich. Mandate it. wait body count get people's attention. Even doesn't, get influenza shot anyways! 366 people North Dakota died virus 7 months believe running soldiers Mighty big claims there. I'd love read credible sources have. Damn - videos! Must nice afraid neighbors!  Go back CU-Boulder, kiddo. proved full using simple math. going permanent ignore. Enjoy abyss. won't. bet there’s good money too. Lots escapism.  Spoiler alert-There's cliff around corner. wonder people spin China also wins vaccine race. look pissed didn’t murder don’t think yet getting everyone N95.

My wife physician major medical center still strict rationing N95’s PAPR’s.

But absolutely done. N95’s right now.

I’m rooting little one quick perfect recovery. USA...

USA...

USA... Deaths Way down, treatments must getting purty good. 

## Abstract

The emergence SARS-CoV-2 caused million human deaths massive global disruption. viral infection may also represent threat closest living relatives, nonhuman primates. contact surface host cell receptor, ACE2, displays amino acid residues critical virus recognition, variations critical residues modulate infection susceptibility. Infection studies shown primate species develop COVID-19-like symptoms; however, susceptibility primates unknown. Here, show apes African Asian monkeys (catarrhines), exhibit set twelve key amino acid residues human ACE2. Monkeys Americas, tarsiers, lemurs lorisoids, differ critical contact residues, protein modeling predicts differences greatly reduce SARS-CoV-2 binding affinity. lemurs predicted closer catarrhines susceptibility. study suggests apes African Asian monkeys, lemurs, likely highly susceptible SARS-CoV-2. Urgent actions undertaken limit exposure great apes humans, similar efforts may necessary many primate species.  🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺 China intentionally, would war them.

They let thing go global least two months telling anyone it, they're testing treatments concentration camps, pretending never 6900 cases. aren't. That's good question! long since set mine up, back March said select ""Any"" work unit assignment (or was?) completely prioritized COVID-19. quick search site yield anything saying otherwise. get work unit assigned, view work GUI show project ID, hyperlinked (at least Linux client) project info page. confirm working something COVID-related.

Happy Folding! :) They're pro-life though.   good question, considered yet. tired winning yet? Yes meet barn, cook/eat leave. think details yet. Ugh believe it. woman store audacity ask “why?” asked put mask. Umm idk maybe least 200k people fucking died already US don’t want one? Ugh. Socks part green new deal. Eco-friendly. Save planet. called observation, stats mask usage businesses cities compare let’s see them.

I'm still waiting provide backup alleged 90% Denver vicinity masking. 18,140 cases 459 deaths Denver alone, cannot 90% masking: lose. Now, becoming dull mention harassment. would cease. Anyone still worried needs stay Reddit away news. 

After days you’ll wonder ever scared begin with. think there's denial things issue anyone. Congress chance something it, chose priorities.

The anti-restrictions people point point deaths infections try say means remove restrictions. problem infections deaths would tremendously higher without 75% population making great sacrifices help fellow Americans. sad part remaining 25% undercut many sacrifices selfish. 50% 75% acted selfish, repercussions would disastrous.  Full hospitals, people left without care, many double deaths.

So, mental fiscal strain lockdown ignored undervalued, IMO. properly valued causes great stress even pro-restriction people shows government broken since ability alleviate decent amount chose fight battles. I'm still going wait let early vaccinators guinea pigs. I'm N95 distance another year. going trust vaccine developed Trump's rule. Donald Trump taking America back doctors (an actual quote son law Kushner May 2020.) wonder things disaster. idea upvoted. doctor would advise something damages patient's body, you. avoid public indoor spaces much possible. many places order almost anything online delivery, curb side pickup. 

If want spend time friends, try find someplace outdoors, keep distance mask on. (and spend time friends family person, absolutely need this, get exercise, outdoors mask on) 

If must indoors, ideally would fitted N95 mask, N95, KN95 (from best worst). vented N95, surgical mask N95 protect others. 

Use hand sanitizer wash hands soon come home, disinfecting anything touched (phone, keys, credit cards, door knobs, locks, sink). didn’t think US Unfortunately talking things help Biden get elected ignored. Wow bold move. obviously necessary.
Im sure various business , buy quite certain employees taken care government. Quite efficient system. way also believes Democrats started order ruin Trump's economy. powerful democrats powerful enough stage world wide ""scamdemic"" got countries go along them, citizen deaths yet powerful enough get Trump office otherwise. Fuck understand it, that's train thought. Stupid motherfuckers. Nice see comments bavarian compatriot. everyone it... speak truth. done part 7 months stop it. duty. us, country, everybody. Stay safe friend. Well season missing games concern anymore. Unless you’re long haul, it’s going work dealt lengthy condition young healthy exact feelings. never super sick quality life drastically reduced years. feelings echo mine. play around health never know happen. that's funny way saying 'getting shot at' literally makes sense. college degree useful skill set, take economy alone. Hell, HR straight told us wanted transfer another country could (and two years covid). guys start letting tourists past month? narrative among types Trump still underdog fighting derp state matter he's boss agencies/departments much government officially control. conveniently ethereal excuse failure. mean constituency keeps tongue speakers miracle water salesmen business. They'll believe anything. Thanks informative explanation. first pandemic. Meanwhile government, Dutch government, still denial tidal wave hit us. They're still taking sit back wait approach. that. virus spreads droplets aerosols, movement unpredictable enough random practical purposes. Two countries could exactly things, one country could much harder hit.

It's phenomenon two cars driving way highway, one arriving half hour later other, string coincidences end reinforcing other. one wants major collapse. People posting warnings try prevent collapse. You’re wrong think can’t happen. limits everything personnel PPE medications. ICU beds. 

The entire point stop spread get collapse.

Also, don’t think collapse look like maybe think. Everything keep functioning, people turned away bodies get stacked refrigerator trucks. Collapse doesn’t mean hospitals empty everyone screaming streets. It’s like movie. 


As what’s different time? widespread outbreaks much US. regional spikes coalescing one big spread COVID. quoted former peak actually June. People need safe way interact period.

Just seniors struggling, everyone happy family unit hang with. Even are, hell, it’s year winter coming, lot less people catching park 6’ away.

Now time heavily educating safest, safer safe-ish ways see people closer settings (edit: see Germany’s new move) — anything want cares pretending they’ll nothing say it’s bad. Zootopia? gonna get worse weekend sure. People treating Halloween like religious holiday must go on. Houston... Virginia.... Houston... Virginia... eh.... Houston... Virginia.....   comment replied talking UK, US. hard decision sure, right one opinion. Better safe sorry, many people would die, health system reaches limit. flatten curve short amount time, benefit long term. happened *""Do unto others would unto you.""* ???? thought thing wife got it, symptoms. got tested day week never got it. right here. haven’t already getting ready youre behind, gonna fucking messy. math politicians majority impacted. lose anybody covid. 

Which true since even old people kills 2/10 orgy worth Debt matter Fed *suddenly* said pursuing inflation earlier year. Either way realistic, going happen, even Biden. UK months 80% wages people still getting laid off, small businesses closing debt 1960s levels. know point is. woman height, fucked matter big, dumb beast turns me, even hands. anti-mask protest recently... hell wrong people? even 7 months since 900+ dead / day protesting??? 

&amp;#x200B;

common Yeah. People realize danger way life keep killing businessess.

Stay home get support government? Yeah sure, keep printing money like this. Look couple weeks ffs. also report accurately. I'd say honest reporters. think worst others bad hide numbers test much. dumba00 german old folks region made sure get covid poland lockdown. last weekend thousands people stuck 40km traffic jam Wolgast Ahlbeck (border village Poland). short trip Poland buy cheap stuff. -.- county sourrounding Wolgast starts flare now. second one PC third one WWE. Man, they’ve really bad luck. AEW one smaller. Exactly. sound worth sacrifice me. OP even admits children’s social gross motor skills declined—is chance face permanent developmental delays? children poor less-educated families?

I would argue worth lose 1% population—especially loss heavily concentrated among elderly people—than see generation children lose significant academic social development. Yep. long ""Little Jimmy"" born, job done. Now, fuck !!! Let's go protect next fetus. Fucking morons !  brandenberg test applies sedition, mean types speech cannot subject criminal sanction.

Take perjury making false statement swatting... none fit brandeberg test (b/c related sedition). wonder lockdowns kids' immune systems. Kids get average 10 colds year mine gotten sick year. immune systems need workout strengthen immune system future illnesses? know.  seen Denmark Norway? u give logical reasons virus dont care. month ago. yeah, right determined right, tell nothing say change mind.

ad hominem much?

You're obligated find metric useful. argue example easier smaller countries (or states) get control curbs put place likely prevent control spread parts USA. could argue cherry picking worst countries Europe average Europe bad that. 

You could argue number things say hypothetical realistic useful. - said math wrong. that's correct. math right, said nothing substance indicate contrary. tend agree you. Yes fight make better place (and intend to), point becomes lost cause. 40% population never change minds, matter much logic science based arguments use. completely brainwashed Faux News GOP propaganda machine. special way U.S. set versus France?

I'm lockdowns two reasons.

1. Timing: vaccines close pros cons lockdowns late weighed damage lockdowns cause. time hard strict lockdown beginning, institute robust contact tracing system, guidelines re-opening. it.
2. Practicality: Pandemic fatigue anger set among many. wonder, point, lockdowns U.S. would require enforcement asking pretty please. think federal state leader appetite right now.

That said, healthcare system starts get overrun certain areas leaders might forced impose restrictions.

It's U.S. fund businesses/workers stay home short period time. won't.  Fuck pension. get nothing  saw speculation before, places like texas summer people go indoors escape heat. 

This airborne virus likes stagnate air. wonder new hospitalizations affect election. fucking take back country. force. means necessary. Nothing change unless take matters hands Help lol (im belgian im hs student ill room week half vaca) want epidemiological answer, long takes get across country. Unless gets Vermont place that's miraculously avoided it, last surge first wave, though cases continue remain high, first wave end. get cases low level extended period time particular area resurges, that's second wave. It'd totally possible say, NYC second wave Wisconsin still throes first. Country important region. Covid, going functional difference first second wave terms kind people risk hospitalized spreads. surge surge. Waves terminology. Thank you! true. sister's boyfriend lives got it. never did. I'd rather overly cautious risk killing wife. ~~Politics~~ complete mystery. sentence teachers death disability? Interesting hot take.  uninsured rack $50K+++ hospital bills? Long haulers may need extended care years rest lives?

That people can't recognize we're headed towards exponential growth prevalence covid practically everywhere, get much worse. 

Simple public health measures us back normal much faster, get fervent resistance, accept expect point. 

The parallels Spanish Flu stunning. matter much emphasize we’re “not even close”, matter phrase it, truth one really cares anymore phased it. true CFR 0.2-0.5%. Dense?! use word dense me?! ever use word around me. Easy say you’re sitting comfortably home, much you’re ventilator ICU cant see family call FaceTime anything else. Yup. Thinking more, free Vitamin distribution would probably pay 50 times over, due savings health care costs. It’s political problem, one gets rich gets credit theoretical “savings”. People ass gym I'm sorry shit happening you, guy.

Blame sick person weirdly popular game reddit. Scared people want believe follow every rule perfectly they'll 100% safe.

Truth whole country would cooperate follow guidelines months ago keep cases low. Every guideline follow still right thing do, infection around communities now. priviledged opportunity bunker never exposed. Others go face exposure provide services people lucky enough hide home. “Human nature” extreme cop out. lot Asian countries handling way it’s supposed be. anything, call “human” associated self-awareness. Anything comes Id animal nature. hate people use term “human nature” sense, unless you’re arguing humans choice animalistic, isn’t case. organized social society makes us human. Obesity major risk factor it’s culturally forbidden talk disease. exists many levels, fat-positive media US government farm subsidies. Turned corner then. ""sponge bob"" meme ""dog hell"" meme rolled one, except fire Corona Virus...unless California Colorado, fire actual fire. true! “smartest” friends caused lower expectations. agree aforementioned thought location shouldn’t affect much vote worth deciding election affects everyone equally. idea person majority Americans want power elected (i.e. winning popular vote) sounds like perfect scenario. far long idealistic minority ruled oligarchic fist. cannot eradicate unless whole world cooperate. end well France virus come back. need worry. ""rounding curve"". disappear. (sarcasm)  Still, adjusted per capita USA like 12th regards containment. Per CDC website!   found reduce hospital stays, marginal amount specific set patients met certain criteria. majority patients help high incidence complications. likely harm help you. much elders. willing let children vaccines trials, ready give every kid vaccine untested age group? even give kid vaccine? Indeed, need shown shit shake taking shit show seriously. wonder heavily I’ve exposed 19 times work far I’m aware of(17 mask surgical KN95 2 times let guard down, eating lunch person work also hugged partner also tested positive next day, mask time, know) gotten tested weekly since July, negative. I’m pretty sure back March experience makes wonder immunity thing lot. enough people flout rules enough people go protesting it, fail change anything. lot people super pissed lockdowns want another one matter what.

People choice France. get fine respect it. People giving T***p waaaaaaay credit deserves vaccine. im sure im going win, became president, would honored America’s Chief Spirographologist! totally agree. might unrealistic now, feel effective, easily accessible, ready-to-use home Covid tests could really solve lot social issues pandemic. ""Hey guys, grandma exciting see everyone Xmas. make sure stay date tests deciding come."" 

People test home rapid results, time, therefore mitigating risk close contact others otherwise unable visit unknown factor infection. He's probably basing opinion data. medical student, I've unbelievably disappointed see physicians touting information based fact, lending credentials give credibility science deniers. Wild. They're far somehow vocal minority much Tegnell’s comment Sweden lower level spread’. Yet another incorrect statement good doctor. moment right wing media starts using country Sweden highly socialized welfare system poster child understand full shit are. 

They went protest #BeLikeSweden explain people universal paid healthcare annual ceiling patient payments, paid sick leave, paid parental sick leave, wide access unemployment benefits, government covering salaries large amount employees since spring employers lay production (they moved employees example 20% normal hours, government covering difference 80% normal salary people still getting paid almost working much less) usually shut up. Average people (with income per year 53K USD) taxed 32% people income pay additional 20% values that. may true extent, brag loudly. amount stomach trouble year half India something envy (and access nanoparticle filtration system). Low death rate probably also lot younger population, still suspect they've massively undercounted cases deaths. government really even idea many people country, could properly assess death toll? Disunited States America monday test inconclusive, tuesday test positive typically extended recessions. Unfortunately, think that's highly unlikely now. There's way lame duck President Republican Senate going support much anything. They're going go full austerity incoming Democratic administration. got first one adult life last week. might cases vote manipulation/brigade sub Small densly populated country lots visitors countries (EU parlament located there) Give drugs too.

Any time spent Facebook much time. like movie plot! Higher authority, turns blind eye, reality is.... I've seen movie before, end perfectly... NFL set precedent fines (tennessee titans) following covid protocol. baseball's precedent (i think) fines related fights early year. Yeah don’t understand think there's massive global conspiracy make Trump look bad. Like ego huge narcissistic think entire world revolves around president? People wear masks Europe.  like declaring victory first half WW2. We’re headed November. don’t think we’re talking short term anymore fair. 

And it’s fair say haven’t made “serious” attempt actions decided take dramatic 40 million people lost jobs one point. That’s serious stuff, dude. read like 50% restaurants close permanently city. Trump might took seriously, governors did. 

We maybe didn’t go hard enough, and/or maybe thing completely possible stop (that’s given way), evidence spikes around world right now; even countries much stricter rules ours. It’s easy.

People generally believe virus exists, really translate actually obeying existing restrictions. help seem really inconsistent random.

For example, mask-wearing mandatory since May, even plenty people wear wrong (uncovered noses mostly). includes shopkeepers security personnel malls, still open. people, especially older generation, also use plexiglass visors even ""half-visors"" barely give protection.

Plenty businesses closed recently, including restaurants fitness clubs, use inconsistent law stay open. already fitness club declared church cafe enters short-term work contract every customer. Several restaurants city also started offer rooms rent qualify hotels. even special needs kids attending person classes?

While discusses many factors play role, really answer even pretend conclusive answer.

"" Experts speaking TIME say can’t point anything specific made Czech Republic Belgium unique among E.U. states handling pandemic, instead attributing rise cases combination factors, relatively arbitrary nature virus spreads populations. ""

Of course article writers major publications typically choose headlines - judging article, can't imagine author happy one chosen. Sweden, implement lockdowns, fewer cases European country, better GDP growth lower debt growth?

Could need lockdowns, need masks, tests selective quarantines? Deaths inevitable, even strictest countries lots them. Unfortunately yes.

Just one person's experience. 🤷🏽‍♀️ 1:30 min. original source suggestion based respiratory viruses:

""Recently, research Hong Kong shown patients infected severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) highest salivary viral load oropharyngeal saliva swab sample first week, especially day German researchers found infected patients could identified throat swab tests first day symptom onset, symptoms often mild Within first week infection, viruses oropharynx throat ones actively replicated. Initially, virus detected feces. addition, genome sequence virus isolated throat different isolated lung patient. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 suggested exhibit tropism tissues throat.

Taiwan experienced SARS outbreak importance wearing masks emphasized, could reduce amount virus inhaled, thereby reducing initial viral load. Therefore, mask policy implemented early Taiwan current pandemic, resulted relatively lower number coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. However, several countries high numbers COVID-19 infection deaths, especially owing shortage masks medical protection equipment. current COVID-19 pandemic, suggested personal protection habits include wearing masks, washing hands frequently, maintaining social distance. general high-risk populations, including medical staff people quarantine, development new preventive measures reduce incidence least disease severity COVID-19 urgently needed. One study China showed higher SARS-CoV-2 RNA load nasopharynx related severity Reducing amount virus body tissue initial stage infection might positively influence course disease. addition, SARS-CoV-2 characteristic initial throat tropism. Thus, throat gargling, ancient therapeutic method, might potentially useful controlling COVID-19 pandemic.

A randomized trial study Japan showed throat gargling tap water 3 times day significantly reduced incidence upper respiratory tract infection (UTRI) Another randomized trial study England showed nasal cavity irrigation throat gargling hypersonic saline 48 h symptom onset patients UTRI significantly reduced period illness 1.9 days, use medications 36%, household contact transmission 35%, viral load possible reasons effectiveness throat gargling may physical washing agent used throat gargling causes shedding virus infected cells causes chemical inactivation virus. concentration chlorine tap water Japan reaches 0.5–0.8 mg/L areas, enough ensure inactivation virus. Chloride ions hypertonic saline shown inhibit virus replication used cells produce hypochlorous acid exert antiviral effects. Although throat gargling chloride solutions positive results, large-scale studies needed determine chloride concentration gargling frequency. cost throat gargling tap water saline inexpensive almost free, social economic benefits reducing UTRI might huge.

Although throat gargling helps clean mouth throat, still method developed clean respiratory tract. addition, currently, evidence found help eliminate COVID-19. patients hypertension kidney disease, ingestion excessive saline avoided. People abnormal swallowing reflexes also avoid gargling prevent unexpected choking aspiration pneumonia.

Throat gargling could reduce viral load throat patients URTI. Although cannot eradicate virus, reduce viral load oropharynx. SARS-CoV-2 shows tropism throat tissue, associated disease transmission severity. effective antiviral treatment developed yet.

Meh, things worked out. example Sweden lock first wave spring economy benefit compared Nordic countries. Yeah America. Actively seeking find solutions spikes surges??? talking France???? looking lockdown vindicate fact partaken inaction equal to, perhaps worse America. 52,000 cases day country 67 million people spike surge, damn disaster. Seems like recant accusations go “NO U!!” target suppres number gave breathing room hospitals, 1 month lockdown enough.. put fighting pandemic. next point say they’ve strengthened industry. Meaning past tense strengthened. considering last week “reaching turn” I’m pretty sure they’re claiming we’re already road recovery. bullies points past tense. does. already declared bundestag earlier year. It’s frustrating fuck knowing people like that. mom put trip lifetime pandemic, she’s literally home last ~7-8 months doesn’t want get or

She’s 67 partner 77 (I wanna say), they’re higher risk factor, though they’re healthy ages. still, incredibly

I'd argue opposite, helicopter parenting good parenting opinion. Kids need good balance family non family time. would require government decide put listening device home 1984 already there

Instead got private mega corporations install infrastructure communications devices used well funded marketing teams get us rush stores buy soon come out... Reread comment. Stop misrepresenting said. 

My point right wing media, Sweden approach. Anyone half brain understands right wing media's characterisation Swedish response covid deceitful misrepresentation. 

Life continued normal Sweden. Added that, Swedish culture different parts EU worse affected (like Italy, Spain France). comparison, reserved, often live alone, engage personal/physical greetings etc

You really misrepresenting people though. favours. speculate. Ask questions. Oi plebs! Stay poor, aspire anything bad health!!!! Indeed, it’s delaying COVID problem it’s worth remembering it’s also attempt prevent hospitals healthcare services becoming overstretched hopefully giving chance help health problems (not COVID patients). compare India West? India double cases rest Asia put together. Pakistan Bangladesh, example, done much better? probably levels hygiene sanitation. Also ""FOCUSING SCIENCE: President Trump following science protecting vulnerable, preventing hospital overcrowding, saving lives ending harmful lockdowns."" amount hypocrisy one statement alone agonizing could see people arrested. asking folks been. looking go houses forcibly quarantine families. want know days scientific purposes alert others trust might put risk. lockdown effective developing countries compared developed countries.. mean true guys totally fucked never see family vaccine wouldn’t work. active ingredients flavoring? referring Alex Jones conspiracy theories 5G causing Covid actual satistics showing opposite everyone else saying. example graph below, 2nd wave covid admissions way declining.

Unfortunately, Trump right one thing, America never made shutdown. system help people times crisis. total failure American people confirms already knew, one gives fuck US shit gets rough. always case even normal times (its easy go middle class poor) highlighted times like this. wealthy want give lower middle class cent. big difference working enough supply even healthcare personal use germany..

Yes, see now. Democrats wheeling elderly onto bus shipping off. even. That’s largely due tests done though. Hospitalizations, ICU deaths starting catch up. either virus less lethal, massive reporting April. 

Anyway, November definitely going fun. Let's see...

For example, personally, know one died covid, one neighbor killed lockdown. people brush masks COVID / yet effected directly little empathy others, people *significantly* impacted restrictions also little empathy thus lash suggestion there's issues.

Yup. Idaho filling hospitals Washington. Soon they’ll filling things Seattle, absolutely deal spillover eastern Washington Idaho fills hospitals. 

If people die anti-mask assholes Idaho, Seattle gonna dislike Idaho already do. “let Idaho live die own” sentiment much rising here.

I agree needs done (especially Flanders). france. [This ICU capacity rate departement red bar COVID patients, green bar patients empty beds. Large departements, like Lyon, operating 100% capacity COVID. Paris 60% ICU beds filled COVID ICU capacity designed this, people stop emerncy surgeries heart attacks departement filled COVID patients. That's lame. Regardless, videos made jealous. think daily death rate much lower 3 months ago beginning August? There’s news conference happening literally now. I’d wait hours new information become available...

Meanwhile, livelihood keeps getting delayed virus. income zero assistance state (that qualify for). want start long-term job pushed back months (and likely next year) survive financially. even received highly competitive fellowship pays salary + some, one cares.

They’re celebrating “exiting” lockdown week ... someone Melbourne allowed friend watch Rugby - that’s “open” you? Still allowed travel 25 km without papers, elderly parents live 30 km away still aren’t allowed see you. 

A weeks lmfao Doctors aren’t military, civilians. kids go taxpayer funded public schools doesn’t mean expect economically successful. best response public would take deep breath, calm down, start wearing masks planning stay away groups people whenever can. preparing fall winter spring. expect large number spoiled baby tantrums refusal that. terrible winter result. Govener idiot follows Trump's lead everything.

He held press conference day, completely unaware multiple school closings [30+ cases one school] happened.

When came fire months ago first peak around April, blamed lack leadership White House Task Force. 

A days ago met Trump rally, maskless, high fiving everyone rally. Glad service Spot mate, get saying totally agree. Hopefully people stay message, least workplace town people still taking precautions. everyone gets infected, IFR approaches CFR True, can't deny lack federal leadership severely hurting us lack policy messaging. Several countries segments population anti-mask, anti-science, conspiracy theorists. may people others, foolish believe countries Western world fewer people flaunting regulations. This. ... Fauci said one main reasons discouraged masks early due *human behavior* hoarding.  Everyone would hoarded, leaving nothing health workers.

Now, that's indictment prepared (having stash good PPE available, something rotting away warehouse) Fauci.  like way, understand *why*. 

All anti-maskers, anti-science, etc folks proof need public unfortunately needs told truth.  Humans scared, panicky animals.  Always remember: risk average American remains low. Carry on, plebs. /s two weeks third wave begins... Younger healthier people getting infected yes we’ve learned lot since March. importantly knowing disease stages using medications right time helps enormously. That’s guess. stick head sand, good gone! don’t look data, doesn’t exist. mindset roughly 40 percent populace.

Fucking makes sad. /r/CovidBets 

/r/PlagueEconomy fact Obama administration official also relevant.  Political pandering. mask protect people you. Since wasn’t wearing mask teammates higher chance getting sick. look group picture everyone around maskless. also hugging teammate’s families  aunt work hospital covid unit floor I’ve told numerous times single nurse infected entire time. yeah article may seem “duh” narrative definitely exists nurses perfectly safe. detest 'Whataboutisms'.

Funny, whole post ""WHAT US THO"" Yeah officially know hit 100k. Testing isn’t bad thing like hit 73k high positive meaning still missing cases. could hit 100k unofficially already. can’t blame high number us testing more.  Selfishness cornerstone hyper capitalism. Yeah, doubt that's true. live lot progressive churches (rainbow flags, signs many languages, BLM, etc). I'm religious, think pretty good job. got sent back onsite work month ago. starting send groups people home quarantine due positive test results half ass contact tracing.

My company tests employees weekly though know get guess. know call American Dream? Another strategy says ""if me, would millions millions deaths"" appear like he's done good job.

Even virus ends actually claiming millions lives, he'll say ""well least tens millions folks! I've done great job, best job!"" cult eat up. sensible though, kind too. mean many families grandparents locked away year idea they'll even live another 12 months - irrespective Corona. 

You're better trying control sensibly, pretend going happen absolutely rules around it. Horrendous analogy families pretend kids sex they're super strict, put bunch rules place without explaining why, shocked daughter ends six months pregnant. informed someone reddit said ER nurse best type found Korean (I think) brand called ""Air Queen"". unfortunately reuseable ordered pack pretty solid terms breathing normally etc. Nope right virus front center. noticed enormous surge we’ve hospitals filling over? started get bad. also felt bit nauseous 6 hours getting it. next day felt normal. Thanks nowhere close early pandemic death numbers. true.

FHM separate entity politicians less say-so scientists comes dealing pandemic.

work close different authorities heard one frustrated clerk big problem, sometimes. registres databases authorities, regulators enforcers strictly separated prevent misuse (but might change). Good thought, world caught Sweden increased integration must; One authority usually know one bureaucrical requests mean delays. :/ go away .... never.  Viruses never go away, humans coexist viruses best possible way (a huge segment genome impacted virus activity). coexist virus takes combination science, foresight, planning, well-informed, responsible citizenry. Science get's lone A+ COVID. Ever heard bilderberg group? That's whole world gets stuff personally know 4 people it. know least 10 people around town it. knew 4 people died it. So... Yeah Mission Accomplished! 100% fair. I'm guessing numbers early pandemic higher... testing capabilities.

That said. went there, going up. That's it, potentially 400,000 331,000,000. issue is, low death toll feeds anti-mask/hoax bullshit. 

If death rate USA hitting 5,000-8,000 day stead 500-800 people, might make things change.  People really need learn admit wrong. shit annoying. *the delusion liberty Looks like lockdowns masks failed them. good thing don’t need vaccinate 95% population stop spread virus Given demographics...

According FHM, elderly hit hard (so far) second wave many times likely die younger people. 

If virus starts spreading elder care facilities (that recently relaxed restrictions) number fatalities likely increase, level before. Australian social media heavily monitored censored, ignore lunatics wife's family came visit fall, son high risk. stayed elsewhere, met outside 2m apart time, usual hugs. Even homemade dinner together plated inside placed separate tables group retrieve.

It sucked, worked. We’re comparing US EU though.

For instance, New Jersey death rate 1,853 per million. highest country death rate 1,237 per million.

5 states higher death rate highest country.

Belgium highest death rate country EU 951 per million number deaths also rise. Lower first, rise every state. Ventilators called respirators Danish (and likely Swedish too) may confusion comes from. could anyone seen coming cases removed US. happening lot places. Many older people care. all...but way should. ok die, gotcha. run yen almost debt owned Japanese citizens institutions.

Japan run yen, willing loan yen govt issues it, *what willing it?*

Issuer debt assumed safe currency itself. European Union choosing borrow Euros would different.

I know capability right now, hence asking vision leadership. decade gutter enough, really going try manage pandemic hand tied behind backs also? start rising week 2 cases start rising. Hospitalizations up, deaths certainly spike soon. Trump right again!

/s think need consider sizeable percent people point would either deny coronavirus hide symptoms social stigma, like std point.

""I may fever cough, know certain coronavirus would even get from?"" Idk lockdown, probably federal mask mandate least USA! USA! USA! less European countries per million. I'm surprised people think way considering political climate. ""We're rounding final turn speak"" -every single day past 3 months No, testing 18's fine. acceptable, small chance fine completely unfair. trusted enough decide whether sex buy beer can't agree part clinical trial. know couple people get infected, none died. were/are unhealthy that's way choose live. tell otherwise?

They doubt getting infected spring also, testing them. affect fast deaths rise, many Treatments getting better

Aside dex, there's actually evidence true. Every treatment shown nothing. And, again, affect rapidly deaths rising. Deaths rising Data testing issues

Yes. look lower data testing issues. Daily deaths hospitalizations much higher locked spring. true everywhere US Europe. virus spreading fast then, course actions. Gonna miss Gym, necessary, god help catch somebody wearing mask school... second wave we’re still riding first 

*taps head going Italy?

In 2 weeks UK case number gone 25% (from 19k 24k).

Italy gone 7k 24k period. 240% increase.

25% 240%

What going on? rise fast frightening. Europe second wave give shit :) Link please? fellow Belgian, beyond furious.

All politicians virologists tell can't get right. apparent weeks measures taken. lack action incompetence killing thousands people. 

Wtf even pay people for? That's true. Japan run yen almost debt owned Japanese citizens institutions. US currency reserve one world. EU definitely level trust among investors states like Germany others. say EU power freely issue bonds would break union anyone could even blink. Available 2028 1 million day whole pandemic would 1 year. course entire country would collapse deaths would millions. 

I sure stockholder values would increase time that, right? may enough get Christmas. Christmas lockdown would awful. Trying write without sounding cold. one factor probably fact really really sick people real sensitive effect covid 19 already passed away.

Wrong. recommended using *primary* containment strategy. acknowledged usefulness supported effective test-trace-isolate economic devastation brought forth strategy proven damaging virus 

Firstly come referred 'lockdown' diverse heterogeneous range strategies. largely ceased much meaning due uncritical deployment concept yourself. Secondly, way statement made confidence. work several PhDs disentangle economic effects different aspects pandemic responses. Worth noting, though, places implemented heavy restrictions activity appropriate length time supported effective test-trace-isolate programmes seeing best economic recoveries emphasis placed counter treatments means preventing worst Covid symptoms taking place 

Oh, course, counter treatments along entire planet's research infrastructure missed 11 months. knew? Nobel prize goes u/CPAlum_1 retrospective study came saying 80% people hospital Covid deficient Vitamin 

Did know 100% bones too? Maybe bones problem? message needs get mainstream public 

It has. mainstream public. literally posted media link Instead trying hide, go take ton Vitamin Zinc. give people chance something positive change reducing likelihood ever go hospital catch Covid 

There 0 evidence support claim supplements reduce chance hospitalisation. garbage, dangerous advice. insane argument. Next time call cops see someone driving might hit somebody. opinion Covid changed? Two months ago, cousins Poland writing nothing, planning holidays parties, seemed think problems countries exaggerated. silent I'm worried. would using picture evidence claim end pandemic **when literally first goddamn bullet point there?**

""Due significance asymptomatic pre-symptomatic transmission, guidance reinforces need test asymptomatic persons, including close contacts person documented SARS-CoV-2 infection,"" CDC says.  Hey assholes, flu. look fucking flu numbers CDC website. Everything Covid now. Stop morons world literally thinks US biggest threat global stability. 6 months pandemic got 1 $1200 stimulus check. $200 bucks month isn’t kind aid need. Exponential growth :(

Also yikes +30% test positivity mean can't eat tax cuts? Listen, I'm going argue kind nothing thinking. lockdown good outlasts transmission period virus, long *majority* adhere it, coordinated, like said earlier, world-wide efforts same. asked proof, gave some, good enough. said lockdowns work, immediately pointed one did. I'm wasting time anymore.

And, no, point. Coming lockdown needs phased -- scientists saying time -- stay two weeks go party close quarters, unprotected, bunch people. either listen science don't. problem. Nah coinciding second wave/surge. Nothing arbitrary. don’t think police gonna come saying “yo, person foreign accent said making noise”. show bust party Yes, Trump idiot know that. thinks beat it. We're fucked. 20-30k cases per day till Nov 4th people still gonna house partys stuff :/ Shit, steep growth ICU cases :(

That's second wave full brutality  America: “Hold beer...”   everyone getting one either ignorant it, arrogant, lazy full anti vax.

thanks compliments! ""Trump Administration Releases Science Technology Accomplishments First Term""

Yeah...we're ones making narrative. Fuck off. Good job actually trying fight virus! issues understanding cause effect? 6 year old nephew might able explain you...

Meanwhile husband (a manager) unable get favorite tech come back old job. He's asking months, tech enjoying unemployment, loathe give job.

It's weird time. depresses most. thing right front killing people every day. see people nervous, people taking precautions, cases rise day.

The feedback loop quick can't handle cannot handle anything close global warming.

I'm disappointed peers. ashamed British days. succeeded despite relentless attacks Murdoch media.

No, aren’t. page CDC specifically states hospitalizations up. overall cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate week ending October 17, 2020 193.7 hospitalizations per 100,000 population.
Since week ending September 26 (MMWR week 39), weekly hospitalization rates increased age groups combined, driven primarily increase rates among adults aged 50 years older. mask wearing brought cases down. 2 month lockdown. every country world still dealing it? PPP loan 

It meant help renters. meant help landlord keep employees employed. 

If employed small business likely got PPP loan help keep employed.

But reality done direct payments everyone. Would helped much filtering everything bunch middle men. can't missed fact Sweden killed lot Swedes Denmark killed Danes.

You think clever ignoring dead Swedes. cherrypicking. Sacrifice old young live normally. Experiment young benefit older. sacrificing 20-55 demographic?   think there’s misconception regarding effectiveness lockdowns floating around. 

A lockdown inherently *will* work immediate sense. virus transmits human contact, population stays confined immediate social circle, virus cannot spread. 

A lockdown may perceived “not work” result post hoc behavior population. end lockdown, people assume virus “is over” fully go back normal (defined minimal mask wearing social distancing behaviors), resurgence occur negates beneficial effect lockdown, ultimately perceived failed. 

So way lockdown achieve intended result behaviors following modified continue suppress viral transmission. important nuance believe missed time time. Oh wow thanks sharing Yeah feel like people start caring really hits home. still pretty common place people even know single person covid, least know someone rough time it.

I think spreads point everybody knows somebody who's died hospital Covid, people start take seriously again.

However, hopefully get point vaccines place time Maybe cared stocks covid auch. 

The stocks far less useful sign economic well-being host signals, like wages GDP. figured reporters people ""from outside"" field. Yeah, feel lucky enough live Canada, works like extent, far perfect. people getting coronavirus large numbers likely survive compared sweeping nursing homes. lost credibility run last general election even trying anything government news agency

That's good joke.

The situation overwhelming left-wing bias BBC bad director general recently tell employees shut social media far left becoming impossible anyone take organisation seriously impartial broadcaster. Multiple, highly-respected experienced journalists worked (Marr, Sissons, Humphrys, Niel) attested fact socially liberal, Guardian-reading consensus organisation. sound like news agency reports favour Tory government.

Or arguing recent months, BBC tried overcompensate gone far? help country. yes fair. handled better wouldnt dealing 9 months now. What's gonna happen November 4th? I’m fascinated could get simple concept majority rule Hunger Games. 

Please show work. Germany covering 75% losses oh yeah socialist healthcare people don’t panic losing either. US. client's house US fox business news touting 'the post pandemic economic recovery'. spreading information like criminal? think possible right going sudden care, declare national emergency election try cancel vote.

The fascist failed experiment. want grow number progressives city, county,mutate national politics AOC won’t stand anomaly, leader strong effective coalition party. 

The worst could happen backlash assholes like led Mitch McConnell taking control Senate 2014.

I hate beliefs many fellow countrypeople. right peacefully express them. 

As I. I’m Australian live north Sydney. work real estate. 
In March / April wore mask every time left house. (We 3 week lockdown worked home, could still private appointments work.)

There hasn’t case area since then, even bullshit cold winter. 

Everyone thinks wearing mask feels bit stupid, would killing grandma pick poison concern lockdown trolls full swing huh Look banner America! leave everything open let people decide what's safe isn't. sustainable plan. already control. Might well pull Trump pro-gamer move declare victory. going around world. part true. bull blaming Trump.  honestly speaking they'll probably never be. 

They never go back normal? basing on? Talking folks know China, sentiment definitely shifted year. think back Jan / Feb, significant criticism within country, local / regional government, even national level. 

After all, thousands dying, situation seemed control, people spending Chinese New Year lock-down instead celebrating...any group people would unhappy. precarious moment Chinese government.

However, year progressed, pandemic situation China substantially improved (now small scattered outbreaks dealt quickly), Chinese also seen poorly rest world dealt pandemic. result, people starting appreciate government's handling pandemic - realize much worse could been.  Yes, could better. wont know number meet target unblind study analyze data. UK likely follow then, believe reason Boris finally agreed lockdown March Macron said it, would shut border allow lorries UK. MLB come hard. Deaths matter much moreso. Cases != deaths. 


Anyway yes. France pickle. That's this. detest 'Whataboutisms'. oversimplify excuse fault much. summer, US case numbers horrifically high. entire crisis, US death rate horrifically high. USA lacking.


And another crucial difference: France reacting strong problem. USA regime repeatedly said crisis over. Denialism answer. Still viral expert. guess Wikipedia helps? doubt it'll 3% moving forward. people getting coronavirus far likely survive it. Younger people driving surge means lower death rate. what? forever? supposed get checks? Indefinite social distancing may possible, regardless importance, regardless message. Climate change continuous waves drug addiction (including current opioid epidemic) indications can't convince everyone behave way believe responsible. 

So question ""how get everyone socially distance"" ""how manage pandemic knowing people *not* socially distance?"" Again, agree point. already said that. using unrelated group people comparison. people behaving way states like Florida learning disabilities special needs. selfish stupid. People like think disability valid way insult others double called behaving differently COVID deniers.

I really understand. Extra funding vs take numbers ny, big urban areas still high, high fist spike. good portion cases appearing rural ny counties previously basically untouched.

We knew coming opening schools. know, right? laughing fraud? moderator flair scientist mods realized people take opinions seriously anymore switched back.

And good reason, could name several reasons people take seriously. feel fraud mod team? world meters numbers ( seen generally higher John hopkins, ton) ~740 deaths per day (7 day avg) beginning October, decreased 704 mid month, shot back 840. Good thing got already, worry getting sick this. Cases seem surging around first world. Europe getting hit hard.  know person Ohio seated wedding reception 100 people Halloween... Fuckkkkk Idk 'fact' call USA healthcare better France, considering death rates still high. 

France may issues. know. French. clearly see US suffering way much end sight. Really? Two weeks? heard before.. ARGH! disagree totally. people learn? way, people stop complying. Everyone seems take perspective government knows best, okay lie and/or mislead people get go along plans.

That work. people feel like misled strung along, stop complying. lockdowns US officially ended people already quit following rules longer point.

If clear, think government announce minimum *and* maximum duration, i.e. shutting minimum 4 weeks 3 months, along *clear, measurable thresholds* ending prior maximum duration.

I also think lockdowns harder time around, people made big sacrifices spring, government completely squandered gains allowed things spiral completely out-of-control again. People see wonder point (even though clear point, protect stability healthcare system).  Source? you’re talking myocarditis, it’s really particularly worrisome “chronic” health problem get flu, strong yeast infection, etc. Today’s yesterday’s daily rate higher neighbors. Check many countries [My local police dealing actual Many people need stimulus check every month. So, would look mortality rate last month. number high thanks New York, it’s currently bad. instance, Monday approximately 74323 positive cases 534 deaths. Meaning 0.718% tested positive died. continue pull data month would fairly accurate comparison Europe countries approximately 0.5% positive cases died Monday. US slightly higher though arguably worse health however also younger population so, take want. virus isn’t deadly, ran hospital beds early on. actually believe that? took spring compliance nearly high now. Wow. seem like nice person. don’t want conversation? understand Americans, build wall non-existing invasion fear killers murderers, willing wall actual killer virus.... need end goal, rather dampen.

Here Western Australia, eradicated via lockdown April. back, wealth festivals choose summer now.

In Victoria, higher case count boomed end winter... end goal, eradicate/get cases 0. pulled off, see covid negative economy horizon.

To lockdown reduce cases, let come back later though? hard sell, agree. Lockdown eradicate, close borders same. worked China, worked New Zealand, worked Vietnam, worked Australia. choose live virus ripping economy, destroying lives livelihoods. Choose eradicate virus instead. go back around last turn. worse  gauge long skimmed Wikipedia gave flair? Parallel universe scientists Yikes Yes, glad able medicate thanks legal state! summed well.

#### Joseph Stiglitz

Since pandemic-induced downturn, begin talking health. That’s make sure there’s money hospitals, testing, Medicaid states maintain health care services. That’s priority No. 1.

Priority No. 2 make sure money getting vulnerable, that’s unemployment insurance schemes become important. United States unemployment insurance program one worst world terms coverage income replacement many states, that’s augmented program made lot sense.

The third thing, question whether it’s late worries me, beginning thought important keep people attached jobs, especially United States workers depend employers health insurance. schemes New Zealand, Denmark, UK tried that. tried PPP **\[Paycheck Protection Program\]**, badly designed program. didn’t work well, lot damage done.

Some people ask it’s late. think fact we’re seeing another million, 800,000, 700,000 people joining unemployment rolls week means it’s late try stop that. would better earlier, even now, rate discharge high, think ways maintain link workers firms.

The hardest thing, think, help small businesses, particularly began liquidity problem morphed solvency problem. Well would be, bunch people want riot, loot burn city justified police shooting. worry media said large gathering ok virus spread among protestors. Americans value privacy last thing tell health department realize B cells make new antibodies body encounters virus again? Antibodies stick around forever, get made again. Antibodies present blood recovering means absolutely nothing. Yeah, 99.9 percent people fine. means 5000 fellow citizens died last week. mean, many friends family stand lose few. fine! /s  much parallel Germany's development, although lagging bit ICU (which probably ICU Sweden respirator wrong). Seems problem imperfect, lazy curfews closures, concept short, severe lockdown.

And completely agree. trying let perfection enemy good, closing bars leaving schools restaurants open seems unlikely truly flatten curve. Winning! Fair enough. Omg poor little snowflake, mindset always ""essential"" worker. go cry mommy living unsafe world boo freaking hoo. living modern Industrialized nation, trust fine.

Also, much Brazil including Amazonas low number hospital beds per capita. issues like bed capacity symptom infrastructure well disease severity. Russia reports 17k cases rest world.

But knows kind information Putin actually access to? Russia seeing almost many deaths per capita US, smaller elderly male population lower obesity. likely least many cases per capita. think China hiding hospitalisations death time? wasnt point, it?  Also Perth, ditto that. sacrifices never understood rest, incredibly long time, whilst *maybe* letting rip winter found viable path minimal long term consequences, I'm fucking glad volunteer find out.

People dying. economy crushed super hard second lockdown, retail business hold back laying poeple know many coming. Also cases spike reopen early december. People gonna protests lockdowns super hard. agree guy, saying majority owns minorities' agency? understand. bars restaurants public amenities (toilets, hairdressers/beauty, transport) shutdown cases = 0. agenda. 1984 happens people like Trump current Republican party let loose one try stop them. world book end result getting everything want. crazy someone could read book did, terrified everything prevent really happening. predicted EVERYONE live small town tiny community got coast first seven months virus..

While cities lockdown, rural areas see cases. folks cities sick trying virus studying rural schools churches. So... slavery? that’s aren’t allowed leave job. 2.5M/week assume 20% people get diagnosed (50% asymptomatic never know 60% people symptoms don’t get tested). massive misleaderhsip blunder. telling drilling kids worthless factoids turning little standardized test taking robots instead giving critical thought raising emotionally mature conscientious adults good them?

No fucking way explained cost difference someone ICU vs someone ventilated ICU? extra doctors, specialists, equipment, medication... adds up. government reimbursement set cover hospitals expenses profit made. public shaming illness (did eat out? See friends? Go party?) definitely doesn’t help. haven’t gotten yet, know around dozen people have. I’m trying keep safe possible considering asthma. point I’ll probably end getting anyway?? think lot people still it, different ways. town people lined cars candy trunks kids got wear costumes grab candy trunks. public everyone see, think twice sharing something sensible main account look back March/April, hospitals slammed freezer trucks lined outside, roughly 20% people infected ended hospitalized. death rate 5%, Trump said interviews Bob Woodward (read book Rage! It’s great!). Trump said, tape, Xi Jinping told it’s airborne 5% death rate, compared even “very strenuous flu” approx 1% death rate.

From 500,000 cases, roughly estimate 100,000 hospitalizations 25,000 deaths - ONE WEEK new infections. death rate continue climb healthcare system completely collapses. Remember - first two months numbers graphs consistent looked made up. Everywhere major outbreak pattern. doesn’t matter happened case fatality rate summer - got tiny bit better treating it, that’s going go window healthcare system collapses, imminent. Poland treating patients parking garage hospital there’s nowhere else send them.

I couldn’t find own, made little graph showing lag exponential jump hospitalizations subsequent jump deaths NY: mere two weeks. don’t look case numbers anything canary coal mine since many local national governments hide true numbers, tests aren’t processed fast enough, see fucked situations like Florida suddenly add 400,000 test results due “lab error.”

Between virus civil unrest, I’m leaving house reason next month. I’m willing die there’s doctor treat hospital beds get car accident. one wants too, one afford too, probably would abide lockdown even one mandated. think would see riots/protests would dwarf ones currently happening US guess 30k cases per day already baked point. ICUs quite busy even lockdown effect (and actually reduces spread) starting November 2. hope Charlie Sheen still alive could crank one more, ""Winning!"" comment ol time sakes trueeeeeee, Trump said over, manifest XD know lockdown mean bring numbers cases. also help bring amount people going hospital swarmed. asshats don’t want wear masks. Storekeepers don’t want get beaten up, worse. 

There actual consequences wearing mask, fines jail, asshats asshats do. I'm speaking resident China. even citizen, resident. given choice.

Funny thing CPC even though officials levels tendency pretty fucking evil shit occasion, they've drunk koolaid comes slogans like ""serve people"" really big believing greater good. sake constituents lives

they give shit people even voting favor. already do. come home family every Christmas/New year. month lockdown, knew plans cancelled. government (from am) announced allow passengers certain countries, knew able come home year. parents watching news know situation ones telling cancel whatever plans have. I'm worried coz cases worse I'm at, concerned coz live alone.

Honestly, sucks, moments suddenly get flashbacks home, visiting friends, things I've done previous year, knowing able year. that’s absolutely disgusting. teachers humans too. that's point mention China, mentioned Asia general So, people start illegal crossing border mexico, medical treatment? Hell build paying criminals film video horoscopes news  Lockdowns buy time. Vaccines coming. Herd immunity via mass vaccination best outcome. Mid late 2021 ETA developed world.

Some nations, especially rich nations effective safety nets, may decide another lockdown part manage virus then. Poorer nations probably cannot pull off. Everything black white. comment streets ahead! Let this. costs nothing. Thank you. think handled differently national level, might gone way. hope anything, taught people take pandemic seriously, doubts. senators recess. Let's see long takes get back work continues drop.  beginning mean approximate infection prevalence 10-15%, yes. current growth it'll around May, give take, countries potentially including US.

It'll bad (as floating definition good) even worse reinfection common genetic variants seem starting see.

I wish well, bon chance. also something nobody fan of. fortunately job Well, TBH think short term goal would herd immunity. know much risk factors comes virus, initial batches go risk. Along health care workers. protect first, move younger healthier populations. 


Though concede still know long term effects COVID19 among asymptomatic/mild cases, overall would best high immunity overall. Yep, think problem amended. Right necessary tools fight deadly disease. even seen fallout commercial real estate coming. I'm work empty office buildings times employees questioning ever come back. I'm hearing stories major tenants dumping leases penalty lawsuit damned large clients cancel future office expansions. 

In case shorting things mostly holding money buy stock crashes. I'm cashing least stocks stimulus gains feel bad it.

I feel like people know realize house cads computers seem need tangible bad news trigger dump retail investors involved now. feels lot like the.com bubble except time easier wall street bets advice robinhood. Well look rest world get answer Tell smallpox. Oh wait can‘t. It‘s gone. (Not really disagreeing. virus probably us rest life, least. best thing find way mitigate it.) know y'all state elderly care North America appalling say least. read children born people defunding letting die well taking everything future generations? Jesus know rip boomers lot generation really give thoughts anyone themselves. courier, makes stressed add word ""Dawg."" like word, like they're friends product. Disheartening would appear know mainstream media works lmao. Fear sells good news. true since way covid. It’s like fasting four weeks lose weight: you’ll drop pounds; end it, still learn eat avoid consequences again. need turn 5g mast amirite? that’s Utah. many rural areas US 1 small hospital hundreds miles it’s going become norm soon, especially holidays coming up. 

A friend mine (and entire family) got COVID even though they’ve careful, lives hotspot TN wear one wears masks thinks it’s liberal hoax. wife nurse local hospital making come even though know terrible ill it.

Nurses sick told work COVID. Imagine hospital someone totally unrelated getting nurse. blows mind stupid states are.  fraction general population comorbidities? healthy makes (almost) every illness accident survivable, Covid-19. Difference actually evidence flu spreads surfaces. prudent beginning year assume worst, i.e. spread surface contact, many months little evidence surface transmission common infection vector. 

I anyway trying downplay severity virus, trying say got lucky since seem spread surface person easily. Baseball best structure pandemic. like top third COVID 1 5 runs 2 base. Somebody shut piece shit people largely abandoned begin with. I’ve homes, family visits exceedingly rare.

Beyond that, going DNR, want risk want best treatment get sick.

If take seriously get cases low enough tolerate burden whole LTC catching covid once. goes past election messes finest conspiracy theories! heart goes France right now. right behind you, unfortunately. make popular. Fauci known giving pretty conservative estimates, think we'll ""new normal"" quite 2019 still involves basically things enjoy, probably early mid summer. 

masks might required lot places end 2021. negative rapid tests results required travel. emphasis outdoor seating restaurants things warm spring. sense like 2019. we'll probably see lot (much-needed) collective actions combat climate change social injustice, see taking prominent place society. sense like 2019. 

but want catch baseball game... show... concert... want go eat, go movies? yeah, stuff probably coming back lot sooner year now. that's good. get lives mostly back, think people willing deal parts like 2019 anymore.

edit: lol really sure what's wrong i'm saying things many places world though. everywhere, true, examples don’t show America exceptional.

I'm making argument US exceptional, simply personal liberty delusion freedom inherent restraint act without harm others, fact someone allowed anti-mask example freedom liberty. simply selfish individualism valued social responsibility, America delusional liberty.

That's simply false, definition liberty (via oxford dictionary):

**""the state free within society oppressive restrictions imposed authority one's way life, behavior, political views.""**

As far defines Liberty (and others even less limiting), ""inherent restraint"" all, would fundamentally counterintuitive meaning liberty. see saying, selfishness certainly troublesome, putting restrictions someone's ability selfish (in case, anti-mask) is, fact, limitation one's liberty. claim makes bad person, would right say so, claim belief mandates infringement liberty example *delusional* definition Liberty\*,\* simply incorrect.

Edit: Grammar

Also please downvotes, tell wrong. Uhh, talking about? saying people get reinfected like saying different every virus world? 

The coronaviruses proof duration immunity immunity wear year. 

And very, little information COVID reinfection rate. assume something

/s agree completely. little doubt post pushing incomprehensible agenda- agenda doesn’t even serve anyone’s natural, predestined best interests living organism- genuine sympathy collective despair elderly amongst crisis. 

To put bluntly- lost three family members since crisis began- glaring flaw OP’s logic one dies loneliness takes lives them. lives children, grandchildren, friends neighbors. may bitter pill swallow, bottom line, matters. 

And me- deathbed midst pandemic- would want son anywhere near me. would want expose environment puts risk. greatest fear amongst getting sick, getting people love world sick. Unintentionally, selfishly, causing death another human being. something bigger- much heavier burden- stake simply dying alone.

Everyone heaped praise Europe low numbers yet...skyrocketing back...who thought going case wouldnt come back?

&amp;#x200B;

Guaranteed shortly Australia comes lock virus come back again. finding masks $4/50 pc? Cheapest I've seen around $20 sale. let Germany rule Europe. know who’s worrying situation right now? New Zealand.

Why? locked early hard continue aggressive COVID. everyone NZ see grams.

Do want sacrifice little time like NZ, draw like US? Trump. lot breaking Trump, including head FDA threatening quit. deliberately slowed process despite Trump, mostly bid regain confidence vaccines. Lots ghosts victims anti-maskers covid deniers. They'll even deny they're dead covid that's become ghosts.  We’re also screwed ,despite outcome election , percentage population taken political identity, part includes wearing masks. always potential virus spreaders despite knowing people seriously impacted virus. Yeah think misinterpreted. lot people cherry picking part talk social costs lockdowns misrepresent position, speciously using credibility bias people possibility lockdowns.  needs outweigh needs many. vaccine widely distributed, pandemic over.

Don't sure. Many people going refuse take it. long last? people who've become reinfected. Maybe they're low end maybe that's norm. everyone get booster shot every 6 cautions Covid-19 vaccine eliminate need masks public health Winter Coming need plan. point people going choose take 0.5% risk whatever make sure (1) feed children, (2) keep home apartment, (3) drain retirement/savings stay afloat. Also, elderly unlimited years see grandchildren begin take risk well vs shelter place 1-2 yrs.

Again 50/50 risk dying, I'm sure people would need convincing sheltering place indefinitely. 50/50, 25/75, 10/90, even 1/99 risk working age groups. people &lt;34 think risk somewhere 1/999. need accept less less people abide rules moving next year again... **we need plan**. thought minimum age become president 35 65? Also, business forcing it, lot masking. doesn’t continue longer  Gerne course undermine things things mentioned (institutions, experts) described how.

The death rate going we've become much better protecting elders (notably care homes), better protocols hospitals we're testing infinitely first months pandemic.

I voting anyone, I'm US. Trump's lies bad management crisis obvious everyone world outside cult members.

If want see difference means flatten curve compared flattening it, [look cumulative deaths. America's deaths rising steadily since beginning pandemic. France, exponential increase, managed flatten curve much deaths 5 months lockdown. They're experience second wave, that's neither there. depressing situation 😥 First off, viruses life forms. infect life forms.Viruses also alive begin cannot die. contain DNA RNA genome rely hosts replicate. need 9th grade biology explained again? Viruses infect multiple hosts animals well virus never go away say ""die off"". think lockdowns actually make virus go away beyond delusional. SARS-COV-2 exist population one way another rest lifetimes, even effective vaccine. guarantee that. Hate break you, neither side gives damn people Well fair, EU countries experiencing second wave getting pandemic mostly control summer. US one long uninterrupted wave bumps. going take seriously. sucks, ship sailed. Even people took seriously originally fatigued care anymore.

The initial response fucked opportunity completely gone. office allowed employees choose whether work home not, started going back voluntarily cause they're tired home. hear, they're diligent mask wearing walking inside building, take cubicles completely defeating purpose.

It's going take serious death toll probably someone know hospitalized/dying convince people take action again. complete bias, weed reduce covid way, like lung dissease. but... White House said ended COVID-19. I’m confused 🤷‍♂️. Lol Due Covid? due overbearing lockdowns? Ridiculous reaction. gonna pick particular fight. Attacking someone based religious beliefs never ends well. Also, know really decent, rational people attend church semi-regularly. Believing higher power doesn’t automatically make terrible person. said, terrible person absolutely twist faith justify whatever want. Yeah course! It’s coming frim lying scumbag msm! profiting. running red. businesses livelihoods. total failing government. supporting businesses remain closed help combat pandemic, instead nothing, restaurants bars open owners workers don’t go fucking homeless. Pregnancy risk factor CoVID19, kinda, intent right. percent 100% schools absolutely Covid cases Yup. 30. I've looked it. Living prayer.  Wrong! Biden takes lead! never left 1st down/quarter/inning/any sports reference telling got lowest death rate since may? numbers dropping Brazil everyday. Probably earlier we're using vaccine herd immunity get  articles frequently posted sub need maintain mask wearing social distancing well 2022. 

Even medically necessary going happen. political decisions. vaccine still trials. ""You assume things based low information"" assuming disease handled immune system every known disease? vaccine still trials. Honestly. feel people choice around lunatics. I'm sick entitled asshats keep screaming ""MuH fReEdOms"" actually care anyones rights own.. right want safe healthy? right protect family? 

It even goes beyond Covid. fire started couple hunters said ""their right"" campfire even though there's fire ban half country flames. Homes lives lost.. freedom, right? vaccine still trials. sorry say guys second wave hit like fucking tsunami much time left Trump talk himself, great *covid covid covid*. europe second wave started even germany hits us pretty bad, good beginning second wave pain ass. lockdown *light* starts monday.

be smart guys listen Trump saying. part help country get better thru second wave first one directed Trump.

stay save american ✌🏻😷 fwiw reports saying MLB heads tried stop returning rest Dodgers insisted join :/

I hope everyone who's World Series bubble gets PCR test hop plane &amp; go ways. people fucking clue Bipolar disorder actually is.

A family member mine Bipolar even tell exactly is. experience violent though. (Not speaking cases, experience.) doctor friends they're casual always exposed it, already gotten care point. think they're desensitized it. *very* busy covid people. liberals rule kill babies, make son wear dresses ban guns. rather die see us turn shithole, die, die immune response yes, way knowing way actually protective upon re-exposure SARS.

This virus also interacting immune system differently causing even dysfunctional immune response. tried, point ordering Amazon shipped her, get Mom start taking vitamin supplements.

She pre-surgery bloodwork deficient, finally started taking it. Mom generally pretty science supporting rational person. know going on. wonder authoritarian countries, like China, better. can't barricade people inside buildings... Thank banning person. getting really sick seeing bogus comments Daily Discussion threads every day. Wishful thinking. Let's see like held stabbed 27 times. even ask wear mask afterwards. cousin really pushing thanksgiving. even sent bribery/manipulating photo kids new dog. purchased outdoors heaters electric blankets tent... suggested quarantine 2 weeks before. 

i honestly idea pushing soooo hard. parents mid-late 60's+. husband lost mom january. way get parents drive me... 

i care holidays. i'd rather see anyone accidentally kill someone.... although said, dad retired getting money - mother die, get money. damn, wonder people taking advantage kind stuff... people carry guns Chicago? perception gun carries somewhat common US. Perfect minority population infected once, minority minority would exposed another time waning. people testing positive second time recovering first time seems MUCH higher cases confirmed reinfection sequencing virus infections. needs quantified formally *immediately* put end ""herd immunity"" disinformation. absolutely malicious, cause people think immune expose selves knowingly convince this. heard pandemic would Wednesday next week, right election. guess finished whole week ahead time.

So doctor going say ok go back living life normal, right?  LiBeRaLs CoViD IsNt ReAl GoVeRnMeNt TrYiNg CoNtRoL 100 YeArS must new CO ! [[Party Horn Probably think. Putting mask wearing properly like least inconvenient thing given day, work 8-12 hour days grocery store.

I also wrap dick every time go public. even apples oranges comparison; least two fruit, AIDS COVID like comparing bananas pie. sweet? Sure, one enjoyed alone decadence gets passed around special occasions.


I'll call chin-strappers anti-maskers want. ""Freedom"" affects life, livelihood, liability. Unfortunately, last week represents incomplete data even point. point active hospitalizations up. people occupying beds week last week. That’s number matters here. Dont worry everyone work corporation year now. #WINNING know people claim people work health care, even high healthcare deaths inflated money. 

One guy claimed doctor too.

The people know fact worked hot spots get really fucking angry people claiming that. probably knew positive game. don’t trust sports organizations truthful dont matter though. COVID people ones care about. think people subreddit would able understand difference experimental trials actual distribution. apply chancellor ? Covid Yet again, another example someone meltdown there's evidence ""herd immunity"" thing anything unethical politically motivated disinformation people buy pretty obvious.

It's also politically motivated link support lockdowns, implied here. No, thinking virus bad ""herd immunity"" farce mean think lockdowns way good. 

We think maybe laying unnecessary social interaction, wearing masks, engaging good hygiene good. hard. agree, corndogs new bratwürst Well maybe doesnt care? Isnt right care health way wants to? MLB positives two months end season

so fucking weird... Tested all, time get colds like, ever. feel like Florida state that's great job ~~with keeping school kids away one another.~~ Sadly, Unemployment running many. Evictions returned full swing. There’s resources remain aren’t stretched thin.. way pendulum swinging rn lot people - facing death favorable. bad, yes see Q1 figure -0.3% mainly due bushfires. leaked news growth (surprisingly) positive Q3 period thick Melbourne lockdown. Australia technically recession. Corona tricky, make sure 99 infected once. point mandates dont even matter anymore. Half population terrified wont going eat least year. Yes, resturaunt industry fucked. hoping might surprised. tune changed quickly since Sunday. talking local measure Tuesday became ""we end local measure think nationwide, people understand rule everywhere "" (By way government love pretend people understand decision fact people disagree. )
It seems like want lockdown maintain school open make sure people/ business keep working. may harder spring hard lockdown still work. may already come conclusion possible keep business running effective lockdown. Tuesday evening starting hear news things like ""health life always important economic life"" "" sooner harder lockdown, shorter be"". coming government still ... 
And also fact Macron speaking prime minister.
Anyway see tonight ! 200 IQ play Republicans! Mission accomplished  Original study:  Regardless wins? car. bike use. live apartment middle city Hopeful work wonderfully,it's way slow heavily spread drive testing center went today absolutely slammed. tested positive. Definitely one greens flying high fukushima happened. refugee thing definitely controversial still backing majority especially media.

Managing Euro crisis southern Europe disaster. Merkel waited long, Greece could saved fraction cost early reaction. Go play pinga somewhere else That's unlikely according reports: dont mean get political, dont care either way, liberals mentioning decades americans fat eat unhealthy 

Now see consequences that, cant connect dots think mask solves everything also problem stay home forever 

Its fucking absurd. while, fat conservatives know unhealthy, know smoking them, know fast food them... simply dont care. dont care health, would care virus? Bro, celebrating team kissing wife. hope wrong means spikes Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas absolutely terrifying. That's extra $35 carry-on charge, sir. article:

""In addition establishing relationship low levels vitamin severity COVID-19, including mortality, study’s authors also acknowledged research doesn’t show vitamin deficiency risk factor contracting disease."" idea death rate relatively high? Countries like France likely cases crazy high positivity rate. much screw blood calcium levels bet work healthcare know anyone does... question is: point get people start taking seriously?

When army trucks carting corpses crematoriums mass graves public parks.  covid now, trump said /s fortified milk vit decades ago fight rickets kids. going 15k increase trend yeah.. . real question is, high go? 200k day november 1st?

E: supposed December. Forgot month in. :eyeroll: political pseudoscience context. We've 75% country open since April/may nobody dying COVID. economy much better position rest us support Vic economy. Government took approach instead selfish June lot areas do, many airports designed all.

You taxis / buses / trains / ubers / public larger-scale transport happening big airports, especially tourist destinations. Getting test car fine individual family, buses full people filtering every 60 seconds, bit different game. Airports designed accept people fast possible, like mall movie theater, everyone waits sharing space long time.

I'm personally hoping nasal-spray like deterrent COVID, like allergy medication; spray cocktail medicine whatever drug nostrils prevents infection specific amount time, like wall virus.

I'd also like everyone wear fucking mask properly, seems like asking much days. think hit Facebook Murdoch Should. going to. result trashing everyones life save small percentage lives, people dont take health seriously begin virus clearly doesnt harm people strong cardio systems pre existing conditions.


Btw far heard doctor recommend exercise combat this? Thank Canada free shot, too! Since works health care testing done site facility. finally got called health department today found talking facility lied testing date them, saying tested several days later was. informed health department told cleared work untill Friday. know fallout be. summer? Still seasonal virus. need 30 min sunlight per day Westerners huffing copium usual seems like reasonable career path. Would careers destroy seeing others hard time emotional social jobs live would allow time resources actually help people, need? New York cases per population Mass. That's weird thing do. winning much important safety teammates... win happens every decades /s we’re turning page.../s. VOTE incompetence ! going happen guess Probably yes, I'm seeing reality anytime soon. anything, public health authority need look far see whether mask usage helping countries getting better grip pandemic. like countries pretty heavy mask usage like Spain France OK. think good understanding way thinking, we've living thing while, decisions make based evidence based science, political pressure. I'm sure science behind masks helpful lessening spread virus, probably equal amount data social sciences say people western democratic countries can't handle long time. they've maintained idea social distancing face masks beginning something think people hold much longer. We'll see. Hopefully much better collaboration globally least regionally next time happens. like scientists many fields data look everything settled. No. Oahu. Covid capital Hawaii. bonus might save others' lives spreading flu people unable get vaccinated. go touch people test? positive test, false test two obviously Biden voters misspoke- clauses indoor/outdoor gathering would allow one additional person lived with. clauses permitted second wave. also different told exercise area people could go second residence able first time.

I'm arguing Melbourne stricter lockdown elsewhere ever said much. point. point strict countries, mean real lockdown, called it. seen people speaking Melbourne's lockdown terms Stage 4, consider misleading. places stricter lockdown mean lockdown. second lockdown started 7th July. Yes got stricter August, began 7th July really beginning open now. understand people downplaying counting Stage 4 ""real lockdown"".  summer. definitely sad, part life learn live with.  Doubt it. original lockdown last like 2 months? went lockdown March think started reopening May. doubt they'd keep lockdown till March. Maybe January latest they'll reopen. yh could possibly another summer lockdown next year depending status vaccines bad cases get can't get one Merkel, get nein? church.

I know plenty religious people east west coast fine people.

It's political venom taught Southern churches that's issue. that's religious issue, even though takes place religious building. 😬 body learns without getting wrong declare coronavirus over. Well, 2 weeks (Nov. 11) might suddenly go either way. lot less fucked 9mm.  Thanks relevant post coronavirus. Also recycled 2016? Heard thing “Your” personal get “us all”” 

Since depending would venture say messaging matters. messaging get politicized becomes problem maintain smug attitude I'm right everyone else brainwashed? else get commondreams hot takes? Well will! 

Haven't seen certain group already claiming virus defeat? 

The virus completely disappear group wins election, makes people look bad, want deal anymore.

Gaslight
Obstruct
Project &lt;--  obviously work. humans close physical contact one another, viruses can't spread die off.

It sounded like implying sentence since lockdowns obviously work virus whole spread die off. Okay. 

[--- Checks stats 1k people per day, fucking dire.

&amp;nbsp;

It's disingenuous behave though people keel die instantly disease soon test positive spike cases matter. spike cases result another spike deaths month's time, like one late July. *touching star burns* China right idea. Agree disagree point stands, people need stop injecting outrage drug brains. impact pandemic seen **decades**. lot media like talk we'll back normal 1 2 years - perhaps coping mechanism, societal disruption scale aftershocks long time. we're talking hundreds thousands, million people long-term chronic conditions, huge societal impact. might something there. Sweden Denmark pretty much par right cases per capita(unless talk today’s daily reported ones). 

You, Dane, must know wasn’t completely serious reasoning since Sweden alcohol monopoly restricts alcohol sale stores (one store) 8 pm 3(4?) pm saturdays sale Sundays. Danes making fun ages poor Swedes harsher restrictions normal times Danes pandemic. really hope right dude, complete normalcy back June July would make pretty legendary summer. 

i mind masking i'll put awhile means go friends again, probably right people though. Fauci expecting people distance avoid gatherings vaccine widely available idk expects work. Thank you, looking forward it. Right amigo, better places living going get worse. employer wants everyone start showing office next week even though everyone's fine working home beginning cold flu season. Great way kill workforce, best case scenario absent 2 weeks. current trajectory, would take roughly 15 weeks get every US citizen infected. would mean couple million deaths. 

Just reference: number Covid-19 deaths US could larger population US states combined. worst case, number deaths could high population Texas even California. Tired winning yet? Unless give small businesses resources see get riots like Italy. Many people forget Germany one first European countries anti-lockdown protest. fuck cares public support.

That ship sailed majority voting people across planet decided global warming problem, sold children's futures.

Old people, non citizens, people without high school diplomas right vote.

Until then, politicians take correct, scientifical, step right time regardless on-average-retarded ramblings masses. guess i'm sure trusted. live congested area also eat often/don't dine in. fact we've done half-assed job waging fight even front exacerbates everything else unfortunately.

We society told people they're allowed make living denying aid see through. cares doctor says. leader United States said punched virus out. Let's take masks. Lol see thinks still two weeks. Sure, vacation, that's emigration works. even little bit. can't catch obesity fat person ignorant fucking jackass. public health officials US promoting vitamin D.

Literally 2 seconds deficient vitamin D, impact susceptibility infection. would mind recommending, taking vitamin supplements,” Fauci, 79, said

I understand concerns Remdesivir mostly heard prominent reputable American clinicians. constantly looked skeptically doctors like Daniel Griffin clinical updates go live phantasy movie brain made feel cozy politicians highly political public health officials spend time trying make life better corruption exists third world banana republics.

Corruption happens West Remdesivir thing shady, claiming high dosage Vitamin secret hidden treatment conspiratorial bullshit.  need Dr Kenogi ASAP! USA: hold pivo US flattened curve, Europe huge spikes? Isn’t supposed doing, isn’t long flatter curve better sharp spikes? West TN here. might snow year, might not. would call check, think citizen could still non filer method can’t see masks? Maybe going easy prolonged hugging, maybe example others wearing mask cautious. 

If people desperate - hate think without options. Please mask see lonely friends, elderly friends. Work community bring infection rate wearing masks inside.

We helpless.  time avoid flu would it. firmly believe bit stay safe save lives. certainly see much risky behavior everywhere go, especially among vulnerable demographics like obese people old folks. truth hope safety precautions take helping. see, Europe bit trouble containing virus...

Uh-oh, bode well America. someone Italy please explain mental thinking protests?

You epicentre outbreak highest deaths per capita less 7months ago... anti-mask protests ??? Gatherings, movie theatres open...

How want go back February March again?

What going there? USA understand are... expect Italians may well boost immune system part overall healthy lifestyle... sort thing something need consistently throughout life. shield throw need it.  This. understand problems. problem- problem depression epidemic proportions- might problem specific moment history half country bare minimum wore masks, didn’t throw fits can’t eat favorite restaurants large gatherings turned super spreader events. didn’t find here, anyway. Crying can’t everything want, regardless consequences pays price. would absolutely put business/livelihood health life stranger. didn’t agree would volunteering hospital every waking hour day. times NEED put business/livelihood needs strangers. 

I trust donate excess income charity? else you’d putting livelihood health people need treatment aid. 

Your statement stupid. parties focused strategy winning (or weird cultish ideology) care actually passing stimulus.

The Senate took unpopular Supreme Court justice confirmation moved social media issues rather addressing coronavirus issue stimulus package. lack support conscious decision one party, both, past deadlocks getting things passed one group favoring corporations like mention one trying get money families. parties thing impossible honestly paint one coronavirus response whole (or lack one) partisan issue. blah blah blah democratic conspiracy blah blah ignore science cuz fit extremely narrow world view formed stuck rural informationally stagnant areas purposefully chosen echo chambers facebook, therefore conclusion: masks work. strict march lockdown? Like construction etc im assuming remain open well non essential retail masks required airlines, actual government policy decree Totally. dry cough fever Jan. weren’t sick enough seek medical care, would experience. sewer records actually show Covid Europe Nov 2019. don’t recall we’ve found US, China Europe Nov seems inevitable US much later. experts telling us didn’t exist. hindsight makes sense, another example ‘following science’ isn’t clear cut good advice. mhmm, mind much weight? issues dosage.  country, yeah, winning. Lol, even started fight. know start fighting virus sometime late march even may. Biden gets inaugrated feb, set cabinet task force, updated then. death rate seems 3% infections actually discovered. one knows many infections (and deaths) go overlooked, 3% seems pretty fucking high me. Would risk 3% chance dying could avoid it? basically think Covid-19 Hoax got it. interesting. way, SARS-CoV-2 specific memory cell tests? aware those. Well schools deemed essentia restaurants aren't. problem close schools risk whole generation left behind missing education. sure could send older students home exams probably next year? Like mathematical miracle. buy Japanese mask Uniqlo, mask extremely light breathable. material use quite comfortable too. 

It much hit miss ordering random masks Amazon, opposed one quite reputable. spent whole game teammates plus big dinner night before. doubt going back changed much US huff paint complaining masks post facebook 250,000+ deaths liberal conspiracy. vaccine still trials. i'd rather die without hand it. messaging 6 days [**2020-11-03 18:42:24 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-11-03%2018:42:24%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide   Especially using word ""semblance"". even gonna *resemble* normal society *years*? Okay dude, resembles one right lol relative works nursing home. COVID positive symptomatic, required work COVID unit sick. couldn’t take time off. yawn car accident deaths flu deaths call malignant narcissist? actually care deaths, obviously unlike you. 38,000 people die US roadways, unlike COVID mainly kill people life expectancy couple years. say average car accident victim 40 years life left average covid death 2 years life, many years life lost due car accident deaths COVID. yawn that, think big deal care raw numbers death.

My point there's everyone certain number people they're willing let die want. people higher tolerance, lower tolerance. tolerance COVID deaths low, tolerance car accident deaths extremely high even though total number years life lost similar. fucking narcissist cause think better care covid deaths give 2 shits car accident deaths. wish death making fucking point assuming locked whole time. assume point everyone infected. really big deal though people get multiple times. many dozens 95-year olds cancer diabetics + severe conditions get live another month? examples mean. 

If riskgroup (obese, old, cancer treatment etc) get paid stop working risk sick. 

If flu symtom (runny nose etc) stay home (paid) 3 weeks without doctors notice. 3 weeks need doctors notice.

Twice many people last year stayed home (paid) taking care sick children. children sticker guidelines said children shouldnt go school slightest symtoms.

But also really subtle things, like A-kassa fast tracked etc vaccine still trials. u look contact tracing examples

some people get total strangers malls, fellow plane passengers, nightclub strangers, 

Unless u blast business locations they've found positive cases people retrace steps get tested isolated doesnt spread family members

Which China 
What south korea 
What new zealand 
What australia RemindMe! 6 days choosing white countries? racist. want stop talking it. Thank you. thanks giving something think about. lool true, mean everything I'm glad that! Even another stimulus till January Biden likely getting elected really need bail people screw corporations. Hopefully massive green new deal jobs program kind. good news crash probably going burn lot huge commercial real estate owners landlords really affect people much rent situation. lot people moving high rent areas buying houses suburban rural areas going value.

/s America wait everybody dead : people cases! isnt. difficult find long term developed countries. meannthe years neglet hospitals staf causing comple shortage medical personal truly shows.. Mouth breathers. Wearing face mask mouth (with nose exposed) acceptable types people. wearing face mask incorrectly, 87% chance mouth breather. tried before...didn't work well. Lockdowns cause far collateral damage pandemic itself. would lot less costly humans mess wild animals also viruses reservoirs, habitats Gotta find rural area people I've talked 4 months ago said COVID fake tell told so. need 100% population afraid tank economy.

You need like 20-40%. 20-40% population taking vacations, going concerts, going movies, etc. zero-lockdown situation would cause severe economic impact. disastrous uptick EU last weeks really challenged view different societies handling virus well versus poorly. summer long vicious wave US Europe sailed along fine. time, conventional wisdom attributed difference Americans irresponsible, callous, self-centered compared communitarian Europeans. Now, US gotten even worse somehow France, Belgium, Spain, others managed surpass even sky-high infection rates. changed? Europeans get American sudden, seasons change? Is, say, Vietnam really much better handling pandemic Sweden, UK, US, sort existing immunity, genetic difference, climate effect understand yet?

I really think stop trying throw hands up, wish people sub would humility fact extent dealing natural disaster outside anyone's control understanding. quote? see anything regional vs national lockdowns. way interpreted want governments rely lockdowns lieu distancing mask wearing. article linked previous never advocated national lockdowns primary means controlling virus,” said. “Dr. Nabarro repeating advice governments ‘do all.’” shape L forehead ache medical professionals. physical mental exhaustion must overwhelming. know end. get sick too. Estimates thousand doctors nurses around world given lives service others. bunch fucking morons can't stand six feet another person put damned cloth face. 

I saw nurse news last night tears. said (for - wards overwhelmed) better keeping patients alive longer. bond patients longer sedated. die, hits even harder.

Honestly, know it. Dr. Anthony Fauci says end COVID-19 'not even close'

Well listening thus far, would start now? life won’t change much. meet people outside, go shopping week that‘s it. interesting see excessive deaths determined. Many missing basic check ups even essential procedures. talking completely legal stuff like target store brand LSD actually LSD? buddy talking that, can't remember name. 1p-LSD maybe? Many test ran. positives otherwise/previously factored equation. helps media, Politicians shift focus deaths, dropping like rock, Cases. Enabling government give masses ""we looking you"" picture stop economy. going take years show complete impact. Suicides, crime significant spike. Biden even know he's running VP P, I'm sure would muuuuch better.  repeat first lockdown mistakes. 

Sure, enact them, nationwide? clear goal achieve? strategy next indicators watch?

They lucky last ones dropped cases around two months. end October. thing really seasonal expecting waves cases May least. way society sustain something like that

At point looks like best approach go tyrannical way seal borders quarantine population like 2 months swear every week passes there’s proof clues pandemic happy ending dark, sinister, deadly, depressing ending...

Dark times ahead... dark times indeed. grandma spent last month alone room, let mom see short time day died. went downhill fast due isolation, werent even allowed eat eachother residence. understand restricting outside visitors let friends... Also stupidity commander chief.

He promising vaccine November, that’s happening circumstances. Unemployment state maxes like $185/wk max. sparsely populated can't effectively govern themselves.  boy oh boy wish Well watch power off? can’t simply “leave” US. Immigrating another country extremely hard. need either highly educated fuckton money. agree antibodies, converge end result lasts 4-5 months possible reinfections tell. agree well take herd immunity (isn't R0 Measles lie 12 something crazy?). fear people put ton stock herd immunity vaccine yet know well vaccine work herd immunity even possible like Measles since two different viruses. I'm Canada incredible emergency funding program differs.

We've 7 benefit payment periods (months) far, time eligible get $2000 CAD (roughly $1500 USD). Although problems getting money, rule government giving applicants benefit doubt paying without excessive (or any?) background checks red tape, promising audits appropriately punishing abusers program crisis over.

Contrast US response... single $1200 payment what, 7-8 months varying lockdowns? mired ""accountability"" i.e. red tape.

I shake head grateful, yet again, I'm living south days. matter. I'm opposed authoritarian measures kind. Scientists advise, set attempt sway public opinion. elected officials take advice make difficult decisions. unfortunate Fauci can't seem understand fact. father, Sharat, bone marrow transplant physician, already trial himself, encouraged Abhinav sign experiencing ill effects fever lasted day two.

I mean dad doctor trial. sounds like well-informed. think missed statistics class poorly immunology. also possibility vulnerable separate strains similar flu regardless immune response. Maxis get BTC trades S&amp;P. Went grocery store Ohio saw 15-20 people wearing masks. We’re fucked must live America.

In America, governments job turn millionaires billionaires, make billionaires even stupidly rich, bomb foreign countries bragging military like big dick contest. I'm actually favor strict mitigation policies. overwhelmingly angry leadership's handling virus first warned after, much public's selfish, idiot response it. People kept bringing virus care facility, balking masks, actual real experts already told listening doing. immediate community laughed off. hotspot. get bad, are. Meanwhile nobody cares mention death rate. Because, well, makes harder fear monger. beg pardon? make micro-micro dose parents. Like maybe 1 hour tops fly high get bed, start waking nightmares potty time etc. That’s never gonna happen Well, fine, that's good enough response. Btw agree point, kids missing schools, even get vaccine eventually. Ha, education joke nowadays. Yep, US shithole country. Much delay right pure politics. Great point. recently lost chunk weight trying maintain. many ways trickier losing weight. Old habits consistently resisted weight back.  way lockdown achieve intended result behaviors following modified continue suppress viral transmission.

So way lockdown works people voluntarily continue lockdown government-imposed one ends? I'll roll dice take 1 5000 chance death, thanks. Curfews work enough?

I expect many comply lockdown. I’m getting winning overload would unethical would pass IRB approval.

Now promote enrollment Dakotas Wisconsin university towns open bars... that’s probably fine. similar situation family. 100 million doses March 2021 little considering world needs. even enough Germany alone. succesfully finalize vaccine, must consider selling patent manufacturers.. Didnt say impressed agree. see local government. building uptown sitting polluted property, gave owners grant put apartments in. building, I'd clean pollution exact opposite problem.

We done nothing reopen area cars beginning spike again. mental health bad years enough restrictions control spread. 

Working towards solutions helps me. Pretending things problems not. 

There's spectrum suffering solutions fix everything. Economics, mental health, covid health. Ignorance fixes nothing. wait, it'll change back. could mixing cities pretty sure Minnesota one like entire downtown interconnected via walkways people never even go outside. that’s true people aren’t wearing masks easily spread within walkways. Sooo... explain France? New Zealand Australia woods. Vietnam done well. South Korea Japan largely normal. Yes, that's wealthy gets wealthier. cash buy property financial crisis, rent people profit decades.  prepare come, new age never ending pandemics like ones medieval times go centuries centuries ""new penicillin"" discovered

edit: even defeat one another one brewing moment prevent doubt people listen looking things Ehh...it's semantics anything. People could call 3rd wave, still right. Strictly visual standpoint, would personally call third wave, since [that's looks yeah, people also call first wave virus never completely “It’s kind semantics. want call third wave extended first wave, matter look it, good news.” - Dr. Fauci  Fun fact great place work call center anyone's interested. applied 3 weeks ago I'm working home full computer setup let bring home. best money something stay safe home. haven’t even come close yet encroaching beginning winter... mean hitting power switch surge protector unplugging device. Smart TVs internal battery sustainably connected 100% time even unplugged? Smart TV able bypass neighbors pass protected wifi? Serious questions, 1080p tv yesteryear, I'm widely ignorant newer TV tech, unplug almost devices save power bill, I'd assume smart tv able stay connected. get downvoted every time talk economic depression talk recovery hand waving. ""recovery"" already rolling over. massive deflationary pressures temporarily held bay stimulus. Stimulus diminishing returns next one less impact shorter amount time. covid this. last phase long term debt cycle could ended last crisis 2008, got another breathing period. Covid expedited it, could shock. repo crisis 2019 many even aware could done it. reason still give shit people choice exposed. Health care workers, grocery clerks, etc. everyone can't follow minimal mitigation measures go fuck stage game. Oooo I've got one, remember Redditor saying failed contain virus like Europe has. WWE: Luchadors Season need therapy. Well change thing family me, absolutely minimized social interactions restaurant visits etc. since March. Everyone comply work constant riots going people listening gonna work sadly delay cause businesses shut thing (also anecdotally) people know someone died it, still believe virus real actually virus killed person, whatever health issues dead person might had. think numbers would even higher guesstimate, account people complete denial what's happening right front them. Thank god live US president proclaimed defeated pandemic/s impression reading quote website, lockdowns shouldn’t used across whole country, spots cases rise. whole country lockdown. course two dickhead cops least partially nosedicking too. Set good fucking example, idiots. desinfecting everything touched, gym important me, don‘t want belong „That‘s can‘t nice things“ category top work nurse local University Hospital didn‘t want endanger people since possibility getting contact Covid infected patients. would work mask needed. yeah, right, everybody followed rules, didn‘t desinfect shit. 
I hope won‘t another online class... would’ve never guessed Maybe contrary everyone feels think article poor job regards study interesting. compares nurses front line health care workers including physicians, EMTs, nurse practioners, nursing assistants seem much lower rates infection. would interesting broke unit. Like ICU nurses lower rates nursing home nurses higher rates probably point said - lack PPE. Mission Accomplished work teacher (taking year off, though). coworkers would balk idea getting flu shot. would either say flu shot didn’t work didn’t need healthy. would always good week bad flu picked school. past decade since getting shot, gotten flu. course pick lot bullshit colds school, though! Nobody’s house arrest now

Get outta histrionics lol first Ya know plenty people left school skilled jobs. tysm explanation :) American here: would also take 1 Merkel Context: DOW: 26,585, BTC: $13,166, COVID: 227,000 treat different threats differently based level threat represent. really understand concept pretending? Fuck trumpian Washington DC would like think every country actual plan place event lockdown.   assumed places went lockdown first time buy time come plan.  Well, 7 months later, governments plan, point them? real job take care populations needs. Yawn. Obviously much worse situation already killed far flu car accidents has. killed substantial margin despite mitigation efforts. killed people love. killed many selfish, idiotic people like incapable sacrifice common good. malignant narcissist, really shame good people die instead you. I’m participating parallel study Cambridge, send blood sample every month see antibodies (from infection March) still persisting. I’m study I’m panel people who’ve shared bio data. bloody hope still immunity ill! mean tell theme parks, movie theaters, restaurants, bars, gyms, daycare, karate class, arcades, strip clubs, schools, hair salons, massage parlors, every fucking thing else open pretending like everything fucking fine? 

Sounds like real hell hole ^(/s we're fucked US) Can’t say blame them. It’s unfortunate. small businesses fighting tooth nail survive government doesn’t care them. letting die. Yeah, that's recipe disaster end infecting staff start dropping like flies. 

We really learned nothing 1918 Flu Pandemic. 🤦 like used fake news example..... fact woman penis men periods. parties fucking shit up. republican presidents boners declaring 'mission accomplished!' prematurely?

So actually really effective propaganda. Bush never declared ""Mission Accomplished"" point. banner slogan photo op celebrate end service aircraft carrier speech took place. said, speech front banner intentional, major combat operations Iraq believed ending.

If listen Bush's speech, point actually say ""Mission Accomplished"". actual speech said ""Our mission continues...The War Terror continues, yet endless. know day final victory, seen turning tide."" learned concept mateship ago. think watching Survivor Australia embarrassing may be.

We don’t anything comparable US. wish did. house arrest 'til 2022 got Hitler issued scorched earth policy mandating destruction Germany clear win. wonder Trump's final 2 months office going look like. concerned lives businesses.  
And top that, govt announce cover 80% fixed expenses ? imho done last month scientists said we're going 5k cases day 4 weeks worse, 11-14k.  problem, symptom much deeper issues.

Exactly. He's stupid mastermind movement - puppet others inside outside US. guess take case afterlife. Teacher here. faith left education system, process leaving profession. don’t mean sound defeatist, truly don’t see getting better time soon. Even spilled resources education badly needed, it’s going short turn around. anyone explain cases infection rate? obese people extend lifespan via diet, exercise even bariatric surgery. many, food consumption compulsive treatable. 

""Relax, iceberg."" care, long listen choose take vaccine great pt986rc voiced unfounded concerns No, said [a **primary** method controlling bunch people, help POTUS, misconstrued ""WHO support lockdowns"". [WHO clarified lockdowns prefer restrictions Thank you, too. would say 99% people I've seen diligent mask wearing, social distancing, hand washing etc. red alert city curfew tho maybe lot it. Let's get alive sanity call win. keep putting measures place please actually preferred mushrooms find sync really get them. Acid better frequent trips shit way together you’re working trying get that. UK wait 5-6 thousand deaths think considering maybe perhaps looking possibly same. Alright cool man, might get vaccine soon comes then. please update side effects anything, would really appreciate recommend family members friends.  reminds technically never national lockdown China either. ends de facto national lockdown local governments people freaked out. Meanwhile US never mandatory locked mean... Pretty obviously exception rule. long list reasons difficult. fact country worth going allow Americans right (and good reason). It’s biggest issues look idiot cops covering noses... end beginning! sad thing is, people treated like prisoners they're old. still agency autonomy. Yep. fact, talk people already measure innate immunity SARS-CoV2 previous coronavirus exposure. can't test serological test, T-cell immunity potentially important antibodies narrow component focus solely on.  anychance used Fit-One ??Morons would neither disinfect hand entering would clean equipment using them. 


No wonder gyms closed. I'm bad person. Sometimes wish covid death rate much much higher nobody could realistically deny it. Landlords irrational leaches ...and (if any) approved wide usage. **will** doses produced vaccines effective think said ridiculous, either way: border closings thing left wing politicians usually love right wing politicians hate? far right left trying it.

&amp;#x200B;

They disgusting. America vote third party candidate upset election point. horrendous hurts hear. We're slowly starting hear people died manageable health conditions lockdowns killed them.

Bring however, inevitably shouted wanting kill people COVID. accept reality flat backs bed, riddled Covid19. I've afraid beginning. Isolation proven serious, negative, tangible effects peoples' health, even age. good sense community socialization protective factor chronic illness depression.

Of course, one cares anymore. Zoom calls zero cases. people we're trying ""protect"" suffering even more. Ask elderly person they'd tell would prefer remaining years spent around loved ones, even meant increased risk illness. one asked whole thing exercise cruelty humiliation. Lemmings, running ends. care :) lol trump could acting professional. showing empathy anyone’s interested here’s Fauci’s entire presentation:

[Fauci Yale global  essential. Ok yes, flu well, doesn't. ask countries world also ""lying""? still say doctored Instagram tikTok stories whine bootcamp Twitter. would give brand new vaccines children. kids age group barely common cold symptoms covid. would experiment them? Strong mandates? scary. mean, reddit. no, anyway using ur made stat .3 world fucking 21,000,000 Let’s draw many conclusions Starbucks incident Seoul, please. 

The staff might already got immune. Maybe got COVID another coronavirus infection past. don’t know use anecdote proof point. I’ve 3 separate 100-300 person weddings summer

Reading sub makes shocked people actually still sitting home lmao Dude, I'm running little sleep fucking exhausting. think I've since clarified original statement ""math wrong"", trying convey; way displaying data inappropriate given context potential confusion. want disagree way Public Health agencies display data, go it. I've since said calculations correct, way biostatistics discussed. I've told that's case.

You seem pretty angry, I'm betting want last word, I'll leave this. Another Covid outbreak around WWE? surprising see can't compassion elderly without co-opting language bodily autonomy regards reproductive rights. talking highly infectious disease responsible hundreds thousands deaths, asinine cloak decision go party, wear mask want to, terms people uteruses use talk right choose pregnant. may choose care, making decision become disease vector choosing everyone else would rather remain safe. reason sitting doctor's office STILL WEARING MASK OCTOBER people kept keeping midst pandemic bored, lonely, want inconvenienced. 

And time! terrible isolating quarantine, really good mental health. understand problems.  Islands can't really compared... Aren’t extra 10,000 getting infected around now? friend. help people seem getting crazed unintelligent day, least see countrymen women. Good luck there, stay safe. “Sometimes doors rooms open, see someone sitting chair tears running face,” Aronson, assisting San Francisco’s response pandemic long-term care facilities, said. “People ask me, ‘Is rest life? so, don’t want go on.’”  


This difficult read.  ~~Halloween~~ glad I'm Canadian. Steve Bannon entered discussion. Doctors aren’t military, civilians.

That line also clear everywhere. E.g. I'm software developer conscript military 18 medic. Every single male (That - everyone military, case war). 

 case war crisis, I'm expected soldier (medic). doctor work next surgery tent ""civilian"" doctor simply pulled day job, provided green clothes gun. like me. doctors assigned work usual hospitals (After carry burden) doctors sent field field hospitals like one I'll in. 

To entirely natural, like probably e.g. someone Estonia Israel. completely foreign e.g. American. Businesses need bit time prepare everything. know Corona wait, owners/workers need time...the BIG thing sucks retarded Halloween parties weekend... 1k none common folk get single dose. know 6 close people died COVID. cannot express absolute hate don’t take seriously/don’t believe it. also civilians - people signed fight aware risk. parents facility got locked multiple coronavirus cases. One came directly daughter visiting parent there. one hairdresser comes week. good reason lock down, that’s coronavirus gets one facilities spreads quickly. 

My parents increasingly upset restrictions. know what, generation well, college school age kids too. We’re *all* giving lot right now. lot sad stories there. Frankly, sucks, we’re going something need keep it. cant negotiated away, can’t complain “virus panel” make covid stop. Coronavirus exists terms need address terms. hunker work together this. goes global warming overpopulation. faith country almost completely gone point wins again

He will. Watch less news man.   We're war. think people totally get yet, we're world shaping event likes WW2. bombs landing cities troops marching country side whole world effected. 

If 33,000 people died NYC bombs dropped plane, would trying open schools? 

If 17,000 people shot foreign troops Texas, would worried eating restaurants drinking bars? 

We need see war Covid. need stop thinking 2019 economy way life start thinking going win war. need war economy work rebuild peacetime economy we're side thing. expect see change *really* starts effect economy. mean **really** effect. hate get ""corporate overlords"" investors start seeing serious losses everyone magically start taking shit seriously. France: prepares lockdown further.
Germany: prepares lockdown   further.
U.S.: President encourages reopening, continues hold mask optional gatherings. 6% argument kind way try 'prove' virus overblown. issue politics general people latch whatever support side look things objectively. fail realize lot US population underlying conditions. 

Politically, right proving others wrong makes people feel good themselves, kind huge problem, especially mother died last summer nursing home kept lock due frequent covid cases. dementia bedridden. come sit hold hand long time, always liked. became despondent, stopped eating, went downhill quickly. always believe died broken heart, understanding happening. I'm bitter this.  It’s almost novel virus scientists acting new data. 

Mask recommendations place months now. again, people usually led ignorant. weren't, might well start checking well politicians job. Oh, might even start fact-check news served mass-media. seems like second lockdown inevitable. way go longer without getting worst. idea pandemic “magically going away” going happen. think true lied want pretend everything okay not. Naw, cases cluster. people know lot others none 1.75 million worry, happy.   US drop 4th place day per capita cases Western World--Israel number one 34,000/million, Belgium number 2 29,000/million, Czechia soon overtake US--US 27,335/million, Czechia 27,276/million, Czechia reporting 3 4 times US cases(Today's Czechia number 8427, 261,000 US cases) media alone created toxic inescapable panic surrounding virus. Every day since mid-February, media relentlessly fear-fucking us televison, mobile, print radio. developed distributed entire fear-mongering lexicon (surge, wave, apocalypse, terror, twin-demic) turned people one another, sowed distrust government, made people feel personally responsible killing one another.

This last-ditch effort take person remains nameless, many many people like. take real virus contributed real deaths give steroids. Get people scared, get people angry importantly.. give people enemy. Show life looks like everything falling apart around them, show terrible 'apocalyptic' things without proper leader. Douse world fear fuel light match, get people participate thing happens November. Plus, look good shareholders well, win win. think Covid major part (but certainly totally) seasonal disease like flu--and major reason see collapse. expect things get really bad. I’m sorry loss. I’m sorry final days robbed joy petty tyrants think know better someone enjoy gift life. People hate day. don’t care. great grandmother, still alive 101, says best, “something going get day anyway.” refuses spend single day “not living”. Wearing masks reduces 50% chances getting infected. still, people avoid it. came lockdowns **primary** measure whole lot media figures, POTUS, people social media everything could misconstrue opposed lockdowns cases. actually trying say lockdowns used lieu mask wearing distancing, primary methods lockdowns last resort. [The doctor whose quote misconstrued clarified never advocated national lockdowns **primary** means controlling virus,” said. “Dr. Nabarro repeating advice governments ‘do problem! mainly presented us like 2 weeks would trick, got extended 3 times overall mean 3 months lockdown. look back realise probably realistic plan get cases hospital beds free, naive think would go longer time announced. taking experience March, say France possible 4 week lockdown, I'm side eyeing sooooo hard. feeling 4 weeks ain't guna cut it. trump administration added “ended covid pandemic” list accomplishments. 

I’m sick tired dogshit. god willing it'll major one go holy shit ...... life forms need host survive. Individual viruses die left surface chance finding host. Basic shit, lmao.

Do need 9th grade biology explained pretty hard pass amendment US. Needs pass 2/3rd houses ratified 3/4th state legislatures. (I know gonna happen now, believe near future, nature production system change) material power enough overthrow elected president, ensure administration would plently qualified people. *Laughs Floridian,* I'm danger. clue. Stocks self-reinforcing bubble now. brutal attack. dude 6'5"" 270 lbs. two ruthless sisters. NY already quarantine procedures that. civilian deaths wars dwarf covid death toll. I'm trying downplay covid, one-sided look conflicts. think I, along many others, castigated back March/April stating coming.
 
We multi-faceted struggle many fronts waging battle single front entire time. that: political actors involved symptom, disease - them.

We still reaping mistakes Reconstruction era: sociopsychological requirements survival slavery-based society never acknowledged, let alone addressed. Instead, sublimated 'rugged individualism', power worship extreme in-group bias: culture narcissism. No. Overwhelmed. Thats make 1 month lockdown. Hope gain control again. thx professional insight analyse. like ""exposure"" artists excuse try underpaying work (or paying all). literally can’t solve single problem country. remember dumbass thought making sub virus pointless would last month 2. many drug mental health issues family town.

Neither lot old people like nice people se us worship altar sport. know cases LA rising Lake dodger gatherings? bet remember great celebration killed uncle abs grandpa. 

It pathetic dude anyone still respects him. rate spread hit inflection point start slowing enough population infected. 200k pretty realistic number. NY/NJ/CT/PA/MA CA testing capacity capture increase around own. Sorry, meant getting trends data daily even weekly basis validate fewer people older age brackets receiving vs. 4 months ago. Sadly, won't. acting like 5% massive number? 95% chance fine excellent odds. Around Ask take test. much different spring '20. love Reddit. Less *additional* death global pandemic, ya ding dong. know death rates average year, constants like car accidents heart disease. know expect, track them, make incremental improvements. control sudden global pandemic means spikes deaths well normal yearly averages way predictable established infrastructure place deal it. can't say death death. Types quantities matter. would disrupt lives economies even tried completely ignore it, makes logical sense work get control even give crap anyone yourself. lived tokyo 15 years. yes, piles bagged garbage garbage day. covered anti-crow netting. hardly trash blowing around, human feces like find San Fran, stray cats dogs, normal dirt concrete millions feet walking every day.

And like last time two weeks ago result either soft-boiled thus useless compromise someone takes court rules excessive unconstitutional. Nothing happens, cases keep going discussing week two again. Sweden currently fifth bottom ECDC list 14 day cumulative numbers per capita. 25 countries spread. Didn’t say corner, what’s around corner, guess Well food benefits people need. often small amounts benefits, supplement guarantee enough decent food, easy denied kicked programs.

I think anyone getting enough able avoid working pandemic. Plus rent mortgage freeze even plenty food still bills pay evicted.


If search administration food benefits Covid find interesting court cases regarding emergency food aid pandemic.

Fortunately private citizens organizations usually step unlikely anyone starve definitely problems system general. Whew, that's good know, thanks! Last time saw someone respond said ""its hidden agenda cover global pedophile ring""

They US immigrant Scotland Supposedly lockdown start next Monday. public health study New York City lockdown. lockdown (which super strict) bulk work, mask requirement (which came weeks lockdown started) contributed around additional 7% bringing cases down. clear ""masks without lockdown"" would do, NYC study much masks keeping rates relatively low compared current restrictions (low capacity indoor dining, large events, etc.) vaccine last endpoint. that, there's nothing fight virus besides better treatments, take decades. 

We cant sit around room rotting away laptop die. Thank insight. doesn’t much credibility left IMO sure April. Sure, may adjusted parameters realistic, ever tried model epidemic would know many unknowns speculative assumptions behind models large impact outcome. can’t believe Britton got right time.

I think Britton usually does: making bold speculative predictions TV media don’t forget him. Aww man :( ... hope someday! stop reporting death figures fall zero. Wait thought shortage given select people? shortage over? vaccines work way, polio vaccine example prevent infection world sure looks lot different it. love pad thai paejon Freedom liberty great making sure people die better. saying risk tothe average American remains low. say lot dumb shit, nowhere either articles claim ended virus, OP's comment references. That’s leopards face stuff. LoL! Denmark out-tested almost every country Europe since April think, thanks pharmaceutical industry production. got ask come see increase cases per milion actually testing way September? since lowered number tests performed people confirmed. case suggesting finding cases testing more. Remember human anger typically live alongside logic. Whether petty enter it. someone violently angry (people get angry time reason all) whether they're angry ""matters"" relevant them.

If think would could many times stab someone, either lying (to yourself) trolling. asked rate. didn’t answer question. asked again. doesn’t mean they’re COVID deniers. Chill out. comment remember his? obviously significance you. Stop lying. fair, testing really beginning. However, hospitalizations numbers tell real story, heading wrong direction. heard someone say ""We driving dark headlights children back seat."" understand lot cautious shutting things beginning things bad now. See reported newspaper ""Bild"", Olaf Scholz [finance minister] wants compensate companies affected new lockdown 75 percent losses compared previous year. newspaper reports current meeting.

In case larger companies, 70 percent, newspaper continues. According Scholz, costs amount seven ten billion euros period four weeks. According report, control mechanism."" Actually France government paying stay home Didnt everywhere since opened Oct 1? people talk “white privilege” they’re talking white People throwing temper tantrums asked wear mask pandemic calling human rights abuse. Masks *for self-protection*. Dr. Monica Gandhi [in J Gen Int good spokesperson here. I'd like see far N95s/KN95s worn public: cloth masks temporary expedient.

More reporting long-Covid. true \~0.8% infected die (though probably twice hospitals overwhelmed), much larger group cases persistent (perhaps permanent) damage lungs, heart, kidneys, testes, brain.

Same/same. almost like pay attention Eduardo Rodriguez, closer Jansen. First guy missed entire season, 2nd complete ass perennial all-star, got Covid. outcomes either dying completely fine. Yourtcherry picking total really doesn’t say anything current situation. That’s ok. Doesn’t change wrote. could’ve easily calculated rate infection, math essentially same. Rather spouting off, think numbers incorrect show own. What’s 7 day moving average (alternately last 7 days total) rate infection US, Belgium, Czech Republic per 100,000 people?

The reason didn’t give “rate infection” lot people process absolute numbers better.  showing rate infection USA would look like. 

New cases = rate infection per 100k x population / 100k

Or 

Rate infection per 100k = new cases x 100k / population

Instead scaled could skip taking rate infection use **hypothetical** absolute numbers. 

Belgium cases x USA population / Belgium population = hypothetical USA cases

Vigorous Contact tracing (which course almost useless there’s many cases US Europe). probably subsidize bar nightclub owners keep closed since worst places spread things. Keep limit large gatherings. hopefully enough ride without letting virus get control. course enough stop spreading, that’s ok. long it’s spreading control wait vaccine live 80% normal life Nope. chimes whole way -__- would looked Sweden tested much Denmark (3x more) 2-3 weeks lag reporting deaths?  That's officially confirmed. Real numbers 10x higher. I'm high risk even say I'm really coping. Kind accepted it. Luckily work home sports keep mind things weekend. mostly affected mind boredom body sedentary nature going much anywhere. mean, equally there's strong argument say West happy listen laws rules, long there's pragmatism evidence support it. Right - still lot uncertainty, people losing jobs fight democratically fair, due virus minimal impact 99% populous. 

The difference West Asia / Russia, latter obey either years subordinate absolutely choice. 

It's never black white believe either approach better other. I'm actually somewhat happy see society push back demand - there's historical lessons that's important. I'd like us galvanise unified make sense so. knew Chinese. Covidpsiracy, tell you.

/s Covid new virus. Nobody knows dealing with. China act faster country, U.S. people still debating whether masks useful. really expect U.S. anything better handling new virus?

Your exact mentality reason failure western world. work museum we're getting ready open mid November, right Thanksgiving know people going traveling visiting friends family over. coworkers doubt we'll make til Christmas shut either state order staff outbreaks. Biden wins, expect we'll see second stimulus package late January. 

If loses, GOP maintains Senate majority, bets off. 

If Biden wins Democrats wind 49, fewer 60 seats Senate, stimulus package possible. would look like approved us anybody's guess. Ditto Biden loses Democrats hold majority seats Senate.

If Biden loses, Democrats wind controlling least 60 seats Senate, may see package earlier January. completely agree. Doctors among privileged professions countries. Protected practically uncertainties, guaranteed employment. minor trade off, pandemic work. China responsible horseshit job administration done crisis. Come now. many Germans insisting it’s opposition party ploy November 4th virus vanish without trace? good know , use. Thank . helpful. Belgian, nothing done. politicians fighting supposed happen. temp government better current government. 

It's shit show.

There towns last 2 weeks 20% population confirmed covid positive.

Also corruption, politicians still trying enrich abusing current two purple hearts.

I like people shot.

/s Even then, Levallois-Perret dense bigger Gutenberg. driven mainly low number tests 60k - 2 weeks get test performed one consequence, get coronavirus spread others Really? Italy everyone says stimulus plan sucks efficient, organized country like Germany. do. you? selfish people stand it

Yea, dare selfish people want able pay rent keep lights on, maybe even provide food families. Fuck people, amiright!? Nope testing increased significantly, test positivity rate has. worried it, go, seems worried friends think catching transmitting virus  so, how'd baseball game go? Headline says ""lockdown"", article mentions ""the restrictions Denmark Norway"", even close constitutes lockdown.

Anyway, quote said believed Public Health Agency decided impose strict lockdown time become apparent happening, disease already widespread country, particularly capital, stop it, large numbers returning infected Stockholm's winter sports holiday February. 

Does study conclude Sweden could averted 4000 deaths implemented aforementioned restrictions \*before\* happened, could imposed restrictions fact, still averted 4000 deaths? thought US federal government possibly make worse already has...

supreme court: ""hold beer"" Meanwhile USA: 

Covid, Covid, Covid. rounding turn. 99.9%."" idk that's least 50% population already receptive face covering. tell kid bad going get worse long keeps naughty Task failed successfully. dad said 200 people hospital worked start covid. said 4 recently big state. Virus numbers fixed, want numbers investigated. getting higher cases, deaths... Medicaid pays 13k per ""covid patient"" 39k ventilator covid patients. America find way make take longer cost more! people associated potentially risk fault own. prefer remain empathetic innocent people. humanity depends it. Denial river Africa, way life America. outdone, CDC mandates every American citizen gets it. #USA!

Just real quick edit, please stay safe Czech bro sis. Poland stopped giving fuck allowed massive wedding parties sports events tons spectators three months ago. no, 0 active infections time. exploded long ago weather ""nothing it"". seen several strains already going immune one different previous one.

First post. vaccine work currently? likely (if that's pressed hear say?) 

Now.

Yea, basically. That's I'm pressing say direct contradiction first statement unsubstantiated alarmist fear bull.

&amp;#x200B;

The vaccines currently phase III known work known strains. initially said won't, saying likely will. scientists closely watching mutations antibodies see they're changing lot enough make vaccine work, answer haven't, vaccines good far.

&amp;#x200B;

Now spreading something maybe mutate future require new vaccine. Which, yea, anything possible guess. one arguing possible, arguing words wrote, backing now. Thanks. We'll see dodge infection. could suggest using someting damaging environment? irresponsible. one work hospitalized patients? Yeah guess depends means ""know someone"" Covid.

Let's say average person knows 200 people well enough impacted emotionally (family, friends, close coworkers). us, 350 million / 200, gets 1.75 million.

So guess 1.75 million hospitalized dead US?

I personally know three people rough time covid (one died, one hospital 10 days, one fairly bedridden month). would say knowledge direct impact me, take quite seriously. friend know anybody it, says flu goes life normal. anecdotal take course. Remember 500k r/unclebens might interest Would blame Dems power they'd done Republicans done? Absolutely, course would. 

Politics like football teams. stick team, whether fuck not. policies action. Lol no. everywhere. am, there's mask mandate since April, see we've got maybe 60% compliance. people still large parties, weddings, going restaurants/bars. bad. s

clearly fake news, everyone knows North Dakota half metro area, Fargo. know, western half Moorhead MN.

/s

In seriousness, really bad since many rural areas shit hospitals. already rely going hospital 30/45/60/90 minutes away anything might require stitches.  I’m aware, “you” referring government leaders citizens. Chinese government chose handle virus effective way possible, able (a) legal protections Chinese citizens way Western citizens, (b) Chinese government leadership worry losing next election, it’s one-party state.

Western governments chosen allow virus spread kill number citizens, numbers outrageous, level unavoidable. Welding apartment doors shut would plainly unconstitutional, example. first, fourth fifth amendments prevent policies like forbidding people hosting guests home, forced door-to-door temperature checks, ankle monitoring, forcible removal home mandatory quarantine government facility suspected infected people. election less week; people would vote policies.

The “free-dumb” focus harmless policies like mask-wearing obscured real threats personal liberty inherent allowing government restrict personal activity manner proven contain virus (i.e. Wuhan restrictions, “sign letter promising you’re buying groceries” restrictions). government place indefinite house arrest without due process never surrender right without violent civil war. extent may one day view COVID casualties sacrificed preserve freedom, way many soldiers past. Also hospitals get paid Medicare 13k per covid patient, 39k per ventilator covid patient live Midwest, basically expecting worst. partner trying stock leave house can. Fascinating, totally see it. know, dream, esports sports achieve leaving room. Yet, kids ones suffering staying home...I told **31.1% positive rate** 

Thats worrying. refuse wear mask outdoors wear one indoors till vaccine mostly distributed. broad distribution vaccine Russia yet, also experiencing record number, much like thread points record numbers Romania, Yeah it’s risk absolutely man need way blow Fuck entitled ass Americans. sending people work remotely back on-site

Fortunately company, July 2021 earliest. Well. Thats ok long argue without making quotes people support it. friend lost sense smell feeling void, almost verge depression cause it. want ask many things mind, husband feel? anything anything advice? neighbour said same. He's 70 probably dementia. Yea tell it. Well heard arctic releasing methane deposits now, greatly accelerate global warming rising ocean levels, **relatively** short period time cases drop (along global population). let virus infect others impact people's lives stupidity?... person knows covid, like know it.... Meh. there’s people going church still weddings, JT celebrate winning World Series. Seems important going dinner restaurant there’s lot people that. greatest respect

His post deserves respect, especially hypocrisy last line. Literally kindergarten schools lined made wash hands brush teeth's together class class sit eat snacks.

There's one janitor school courtesy job anything. comment lockdown economy. selfish covid carrier fine spread disease. Smh. dad said 200 people hospital worked start covid. said 4 recently big state. Virus numbers fixed, want numbers investigated. getting higher cases, deaths... Idk going back normal vaccine miss point.....people go Newark west orange dine inside, go another part Essex county. I'm saying like cuomo said shutting blocks down, stupid. going keep people area. going push people spread it. That's simple concept.

Absolutely, knocking study. Simply won’t surprise people (hopefully). thought 2-3 months ago get fall, second wave won’t higher first since know lot virus people wear masks practice social distancing. think remember humans many cases suck following directions.

So, really. would people drive Newark Edison/Cranbury/Toms River?
PS lived cpl yrs New Brunswick Oh you’re insane, good know! terribly shocking. job involves hot sweaty breathing hard close contact others. Lucha House Party Rey Mysterio wear masks. Didn’t say mass lockdowns aren’t good? missing point entirely.

Yep. I'm scared every day going work I'm surrounded idiots refuse wear masks social distance. can't afford go. point feel like waiting game I'm going catch it. LOL point literally like 5 million dead EU US. actually wldnt surprised goes insane lunatic spiral one even predict ' justifies entire argument small non representative anomaly ' ...

/s could spread people, especially older vulnerable ones like relatives. example, wedding Maine. Guests caught infected guests. None died people even wedding caught (at least 7 deaths, believe). thought Russia hurried approved vaccination? Either work they're distributing it.

Edit: Doh. completely misread this. coffee needed. Thanks pointing me. Consulting Fees banner - $750,000 payable Ivanka Trump, Inc. Hopefully get sued city LA  make valid point.

I want discuss data region: Aragón, Spain. region extremely high incidence. today, 850 positives confirmed per every 100.000 last two weeks (you know, probably underestimation actual infections). warning: long post.

Every time kid testes positive whole class shut two weeks (now reduced 10 days) families placed quarantine time. Therefore, quite difficult anyone hide positive, least everyone else school.

After positive, every kid class also tested, resulted significant number tests among age group. Consider that, 23 kids per class, positive class leads another 22 tests age group. positive rate tests quite bit 1 per 1.000. Specifically, 1 per 860. positive cases tests traced back family events, discarding classroom. class two positives (that is, initial one, additional one found testing kids class).

In six weeks, time since schools reopened here, estimates 1.5 2 per 100 inhabitants virus (or accumulated 1500 – 2000 per 100.000 last 6 weeks). second wave hitting hard. numbers roughly mean age group schools 13 18 times less likely virus total population. math bit simplistic, offers reasonable evidence group less affected virus. talk little boys stay together 5-7 hours day, time room.

Of course, teachers following several measures reduce risk. guess measures have, now, worked fine. case, confidently infer experience region schools dangerous, neither significant source infections.

Having said this, worst yet come, couple weeks data may reversed. think wait happens clossing schools, hope avoid that.

I discuss importance schools education. think scope point. I’m 17 know 5 different parties going Halloween night. I’m going two like even feel really uncomfortable it. Part wishes nobody anything everyone boat. Obviously can’t go bc would weird friends like still it’s gonna interesting. Luckily live rural area cases aren’t super high here. Gonna Monday/Tuesday. People seem get tested less week goes on, hitting lows Friday-Sunday. I’m literally one verified him. who's gonna bother looking rosters. 

But hey, he's history books! winner!  see Mexicans though. can't see virus. Agreed. Astros got slap wrist cheating nothing going happen Dodgers violating Covid protocol. second waves historically always much worse first. Study: Astronauts likely die space, people work Earth. I'm places mandates ""best practice"" suggestions. seen many places fines ranging several hundred several thousand dollars depending refuse do. police happy oblige right bankrupt and/or end jail. Problem allow free travel states here. Masks required flights, that's foolproof strategy especially people eating/drinking flight wear nose chin. I'm genuinely terrified. I've keeping fairly calm throughout this, honestly, bones frightened. longer getting it, staving long because, clearly, never come day US willing worry others. Ya, that’s true. 

The study still makes sense too, assuming enough researchers prioritize several tracks. know (rather hypothesize) within healthcare focus PPE, could push tests inbound patients short term, start vaccines within providers longer term.

It isn’t fascinating story us.

Edit: always add, thank nurses / front line. Obvious even data much doing.  Complete bullshit, kind thing makes think orange ever sick Place bets, many MLB players, staff, owners elder family members going die this?

Over/Under 1? Still long way go. 350k confirmed covid cases. means least 3% whole population positive virus.

Keep believing Plus someone else's tax pays vaccine. still problems used yeah, did, economy would collapsed, government would fallen apart, wildfires would consume nation, people would starving mass, almost everyone would unemployed. oh wait, im talking depression, presidents actually fail us multiple years  live Israel wearing mask everybody else since March everytime out. lock down. second lockdown ending sight.

The way see Swedish strategy better. Yes, beginning deaths go end day seem countries lockdowns masks pushing eventual deaths longer term. problem extending pandemic timeline soon starting people dying diseases causes due healthcare systems fully occupied Covid.

Another point would like make death become taboo. Death natural part life can't avoid it. Every year children babies die influenza go alarmist that. good thing Corona harm babies children. sad Corona hits older generations harder, also influenza hits older people too. people panicking thinking straight. lol it’s authoritarian government. didn’t choice. source official briefings (I find links want, youtube swedish) earlier clarifications documents several authorities.

No one knows long take sure. said, sharing range suggesting it’s likely longer end (because we’ve seen, that’s usually taken giant surge, likely wait cycles infections go really get low) lets people, companies, parts government try plan deal massive impact. That’s told. must true. 

In reality, though, good number people, even stupid rallies, go silent starts talking COVID. live WI NE, know people state getting ill terrible rate.

It's relative. fact post history goes back months already told you.

*Farr* much astroturfing world threads, really worth benefit doubt. don't? dammit sports buffs remember name... testing positive.

I read since last night. know him, dodger third baseman Huh? don’t government past couple years. new government recently formed. 7 day average then? Sweden takes one precaution really done, encouraging people wear masks?

They're still engaging good hygiene keeping distance other, lack masks may end boosting transmission higher. Go bed Donny, you’re drunk. Yeah experience pretty easy now. hard part researching process know safely. Also, steroids damp immune system, cause loss bone mass sorts lovely side effects used long term high dose basis. Mr Shuffles Ramp doesn’t need lose bone mass. it! Wisconsin mask mandate. Never seen anyone enforce though. local stores handfuls people without masks coming without employees anything.

Thanks letting know take seriously. No, still Phase 3 testing. Yeah know we're instead? They're sending people work remotely back on-site sending kids back school...anyways..nice knowing guys Right culture war win, they're willing die it, killing everyone else.

It comes hating immigrants, minorities, queer people much they're willing die express hate. Yes, people getting pandemic fatigue, there's denying that... 

only, that's reason governments *continue existing mandates*, *add new mandates enough*... 

because pandemic becoming severe right *nothing*, clearly people cannot trusted follow mere *recommendations* own. Absolutely dead on. started taking 5,000 IUs daily 4 5 years ago number times get sick throughout year halved. school aged child brings home knows what. there's anecdote.

Also, anyone supplementing also make sure getting enough magnesium K2 (no K2 blood thinner), supplement well. Magnesium helps absorption K2 mitigates calcification soft tissue higher amounts could cause shuttling calcium soft tissue bone. Excess K1 well, K2 primarily this. 

Zinc also good one supplement general immunity well covid. make sure anyone takes food, personally, zinc empty stomach bad time. long that....

Here's latest case/death charts New York state, running 7-day York ranks 2nd US per capita deaths, 169.61 deaths per 100k know capable violence, denying that. However, would never actually it. never said better person. would never stab someone 27 times something petty. kidding, right? director general recently tell employees shut social media far left becoming impossible

Interesting history guy:

""Davie stood councillor the [Conservative 1993 deputy chairman the [Hammersmith party 1990s.""

""In August 2020 Tim Davie announced intention BBC ""find better balance satirical targets rather constantly aiming jokes attested fact socially liberal, Guardian-reading consensus organisation.

There far worse things progressive, reality left wing bias all. Read stuff right, might come away thinking science another religion all. People paid that, volunteer. Nobody got press-ganged helping 9/11 searching missing kids woods. Tom Britton late March:

Half Swedens population infected April.

""Before end month, half population infected, according Professor Tom comment sarcasm. Amazing one going away gets warm recognized mine wasn't. Minnesota Walz would able impose lockdown wanted to, Wisconsin isn’t representative states applying pareto method vitamin coverage, need vitamin +magnesium. 
 “Up 80 percent people consume enough magnesium day meet recommended dietary allowance"" 1/3 number tests per capita much higher share tests positive.  


Twice many hospitalised. likely tells us Sweden twice many cases Denmark 2 weeks ago. Maybe. Pence running around rallies people work closely infected. 

Who’s Speaker House hand control President Biden. French deaths could become rather grim too, recorded 500+ yesterday lot likely continue going up.

And France reacting strongly, reacting strongly would proactive situation trying contain numbers, fingers ears numbers pass 10,000 , 20,000 , 50,000 cases day. looks like hand shown absolutely choice lockdown. Hell state Australia locked got ~100 cases day (which ballooned 700) got lifted today, high standards. 

The USA basket case, trump moron beyond belief (Whenever see rallies TV want throw closest intimate object it) lack action states really concerning moment, least, USA really faced anything like surge France experiencing (or much Europe) bar maybe first wave destroyed NYC. Brit here. agree something going seem gone vaccine optimism pessimism one foul swoop. contrasts German health minister saying April 2021 vaccinations. also didnt join EU Vaccination scheme.... whether anything dont know.

I also found interesting Mossad alledgedly got hold Sinopharm vaccine studying. Israel close ties US, would thought would stayed away Chinese vaccine (unless course think work...) Goes show important quick test results are. wonder countries women wear burqas niqabs (sorry don’t know one covers nose mouth), transmission lower? They're pointing we're losing equal deaths 9/11 (just attack itself, follow-up wars) every days, large section country *doesn't give shit*. course, people give shit *now* people screamed loudest us needing ""retaliate [insert racial slurs] lives"" 9/11.

But never loss life, Covid puts open. deaths irrelevant. fact someone (specifically someones brown skin) *dared* spit face tread nationalism warranted rage. actually loss American lives, people would everything power stop spread Covid. Instead, people love call ""Patriots"" hold super spreader events contribute 9/11 worth deaths *every days*. comparisons US non sense. US continental country. American states worse France, better. country monolith. gives fuck they’re young ain’t worried less 1% mortality rate Getting close essence double-think... actually get eating many eggs. Hope that’s case cuz sucks!. I’m fine go 2-3 days eating them. Yeah. Think governor Wisconsin told us morning: ""self-imposed lockdown"". pretty obvious wants full lockdown, Wisconsin probably *needs* full lockdown cases rise there, implements total shutdown everyone would hate him, since got slammed federal courts April first lockdown. Increased doctor suicides work public health (lab side) legit conversations people believe someone sick gets tested every day gets added... asked death rate really high since people getting tested say numbers faked. entitlement looks like.

Yes, disgusting. look type heroes...

*Some* Americans think pro athletes heroes, rest us realize grown man getting paid play game living hero, nothing ever field make hero. However, one photos mask on, would actual hero. Thank Nice username. one ones twitter sharing videos people collapsing street beginning pandemic since memory holed? That's spicey meatball!  Manitoba, Ontario, Alberta believe em yourself, way easy election, news stop focusing much pandemic. keep talking election year. know major virus news every presidential election. /s Seriously though, two people work told this. Keep shit facebook. thankful people like me, solutions like effective cures, vaccines, rapid tests available(and available soon), we’ll ones challenging fighting authority get your, mine, everyone else’s restricted liberties back; sitting inside, blindly justifying government overreach. thankful. 3? Tests performed: 198,952 

In hospital: +958 

ICU: +125 Ahem...

  Cases Per Million People
  Region  Sept 11  Oct 27  % Increase
  Europe  53.06   274.02  417.19%
  Sweden  21.08   131.82  525.33%

Sweden significantly greater percentage increase number cases Europe whole.

It done far better number deaths, however. slow motion magic, works take 3 year blink eye. takes real sleuth detect credentials sent indeed faked. award something hard work.

You obviously even click link. really brave kids trials. Here's hoping stay healthy! Sorry, saying it’s quirky. There’s much validity it. Covid caused pneumonia ended killing patient 31 days later, it’s still Covid related death. Like someone dies gunshot wound 31 days later, it’s still murder. Really that’s stance they’re taking? would think would like could FDA would authorize vaccines, they’re saying Ivanka single-handedly ended it. rounding bend, nope, completely don’t worry anymore. run contracting business unable take 2 weeks off. I’m saying could maybe spare hassle still keep level risk low. used wipe everything earlier year kept seeing new research coming points infrequent surface transmission is. want keep guess feel free anyone else reading, really need to. source 5% population exposed COVID-19 serious long-term negative consequences? scattered cases myocarditis ain’t really chief. “They love mix words around” tested positive today. I’m college student move quarantine housing next 10 days. Feel free ama covid pull John Cena john Cena pulling covid years? ever year Halloween parties, year. Full moon, also blue moon, Saturday, clocks falling back night extra hour party time.

Good luck everybody. Makes sense. guys expected hit +400k deaths end year. I'm sorry America. 8,600 know about

How many kids sniffles mild 2 day cough tested minimal symptoms

But schools totally don’t spread Covid guys stop? Suppose vaccine 100% effective (it be). Suppose vaccine takes longer expected get here. Lockdowns salve applied necessary instead one time thing flatten curve? They're part life going forward now? wonder things lockdown precedent set. I'm sure governments world use power responsibly known do. concerned people lay three four hundred bucks can't get back. think there'd lots people scenario.

If contract trace places, money line. Conveniently election... realize even pandemic over, country ever want American borders we’ll basically trapped right? couldn’t find mask? disagree, either pure ignorance (unlikely) ignorance. Oh, positive alright... 👋👋 stock market tanking second day row. made preparations, suggest start now. way united states anything slow thing down. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* really want thing moved mom state right pandemic hit. Guess I'm stuck shit hole now. saying special needs need person. I'm saying proper protections mandated resourced. Jep that's i'm talking about. story like summer holidays. end holidays try find solution...
lockdown light come holidays would've perfekt 2 weeks it, discover end holidays again... also go get antibody test confirm turns around prays God. 1) sample around 30 people talking study

2) among people severely, severity may matter;

3) know cell existence conferrs immunity own;

4) original SARS antibodies last LOT longer seeing COVID-19 2 comparable;

5) coronaviruses actually proven normal duration immunity 4 cold-causing coronaviruses, 9 months so. Okay, hospitals capacity ICU hospital beds? understand medical emergencies still happen? people likely die hospitals full covid patients. never shut first time. always try first time tho. I'm gonna real mad y'all Locked cities think Florida acceptable vacation spot. Send people gulag. every passing day pandemic, I'm becoming something I've never thought become, fascist. Nobodies listening. Time iron boot. Turning wrong corner. obvious us obvious antimaskers. highlights shortage hospital beds shortage staff things get really bad.

Many people city think talk many beds occupied covid patients one talks staffing shortages ICUs nurses get sick. double whammy healthcare infrastructure bc nurses sick can't care patients subsequently get really sick require hospitalization (which contributes bed capacity reduction, too).

I think clear antimaskers interact local subs. masks even cover mouths sound like COVID denier yikes wonder realize focused effort failure produce promote solutions never support restrictions. Initially, considered sitting hands time acceptable... saw leaders also sitting hands. thing called ""internet"" people lie time. no, I'm still calling BS fake degree. Bullshit. Good... good bot? Well, 1984 written hyperbole. I'll bet even orwell never thought things would *really* get bad, let alone bad dystopia. 

I think what's happening right exactly Orwell warning us about. boring story.  fake president LIED TODAY. Then, ya know what? LIED AGAIN. AGAIN. LIED YET AGAIN! Require states follow guidelines receive relief

That'd thrown courts also. _South Dakota v Dole_ (you might recognize case imposed federal drinking age US), relief funds can't held coercive manner, impose rights state's executive branch.

If want national lockdown need get 50 state governors agree independently. MAYBE ARE??? HMMMMMM Virology microbiology. really really micro. Duh.

Wait till find degree actually Immunology/Microbiology focus bacterial/viral co-infections years experience studying aerosol infections vaccine development! don´t know reduces R 1. Completely disagree. would imply cases never went since March. looking graph cases shows first peaked spring, went down, went back mid-late summer, down, it’s again. We’re third wave.  business longer pay operating expenses? start Monday Nov 2th. I'm area exceptionally limited medical resources &amp; disturbingly high hospitalization &amp; death rates. I'm also full time student. So, even I'm likely get majorly ill, can't afford 2 weeks school isolate allowed back campus...so yeah, I'm overly cautious. vaccine administered? muscle something else? Well shit proud state, love Big V. pulled Victoria!

Going pub work first time months amazing, gives hope get Covid Normal summer 2020! Death rate = speed people dying.

Sweden pretty low death rate right agree said, unclear whether 6.87 vs 5 fold change statistically significant. Could still within error margin. 

Also, number people going ICU Sweden increased proportionally number cases (I know lot factors play though). selected COVID-19 got diabetes project. think I'll switch 'any' 'high priority' see changes. Wow, kill yourself? Australia amazing, great sports, world class everything - health care, shopping, economy, architecture, culture. landscape, shoreline, parks flora fauna incredible. shame want go.
My friends found lock hard understand greater good everyone, whole country. weeks luck future health whole nation worth it. Wow Germany bureaucratic many places. forgot zeroes. think global perception expecting US handle brilliantly, knew Administration relative power federal vs state government, knew positioned fail.  “How end pandemic?”
“We let everyone die. Five dollars please.” Sure thing. safe there! Well, thankfully we're yet. We're 290 000 short, 225 000+ still STAGGERING amout dead. think it’s way people talking. also viral load. people may make 1000x virus others without necessarily showing symptoms mild symptoms. **WE IT** I'm concerned yet, there's one place town. good hear might phasing older tests out. Oxford used another vaccine placebo prevent random ""unblind"" stand corrected, really 4 weeks new assessment two weeks gathered news. Justin Turner worked whole life one moment allowed celebrate.

The people could infected teammates likelihood super spreader 10% anyway. I’m viral immunologist. 

I hope got stomach keep coming back threads.

I've posting neutralizing antibodies vs. CD8 T-cells past days I've gotten really sick trying correct misinformation. press' failure use ""begin"" ""available everyone"" astonishing.

It still stands. High-risk groups mid-winter, everyone 25 60 spring summer. Step one: set national coronavirus guidelines


Step two: create federal coronavirus economic relief program

Step three: Require states follow guidelines receive relief falsely yelling fire theater protected speech

Stick gaming subs. Ah, gotchya. imagine 2 biggest factors right schools large gatherings. Political affiliation, might like it, likely solid identifier expect worst spread. Football games happening every college across country fans allowed games certainly helpful. schools essentially definition large gatherings, especially much control distancing air flow classroom.

The Sturgis rally probably also lot damage areas otherwise naturally safer viral spread. know facetious wish would stop here. Makes sub feel like utter joke. sounded different rally last night, possible  GOP policies are. There's reason USA country getting fucked severely Rona.   Could also genetic factor?

As understand it, Amazonas large indigenous population (and would assume even people regard may substantial amounts indigenous ancestry). would exposed rest world, diseases, recently.

It possible rest us natural ability deal general coronaviruses result dealing thousands years, specific New World ethnic groups it? Nice. Shh. thinking critically. Calm join USA bad circlejerk. Dodger stadium uses saliva test (mouth swab). concerned need get tested, call around different test centers near scheduling find test use. Evidence seems point overly cautious. disease readily spread surfaces like feared initially. Wear mask social distance save effort bother wiping everything. it’s livelyhoods? read sentence thousands people losing jobs? sure. experience, high school teachers used let student athletes get away anything. would homework whatever work/projects/quizzes did, teachers would give much higher grade deserved bc needed certain GPA play sports. Essentially teachers cheating students continue play school. 

I don’t think it’s different uni level. close friend played D1 basketball back day couldn’t even remember subject degree bc play. Still got degree somehow, didn’t remember what? Lol way man anything earn degree, sure much. one making claim every country wrong, based information contained links above. way misinterpreting data?

EDIT: go:

 

The average life expectancy, in, say, US 78.6 years: 

A majority COVID deaths age: people get corona survive. 0.6% don’t mostly people life expectancy: already caused worst economic downturn since great depression: 

There evidence longterm corona immunity beyond rare outliers: claim it’s worth causing another Great Depression save people already average life expectancy. expenditure running open Business. Workers already Kurzarbeit. Trump, lost election, call failure Biden presidency. Looks like still slowly trending too, likely due better treatment confirmed cases Sadly it’s urban areas sick travel order demand care. see graph difference cases number tests positivity.

A quick comparison based chart:

During week 15 positive rate 18.81% 19,880 tests performed ""hospital/senior care staff, critically ill risk groups "".

Then category people could tested greatly expanded.

During week 42 positive rate 3.79% 136,598 tests performed ""*everyone* slightest symptoms, young old, critical ill 'just sneezing bit lately'"".

So week 42 6.87 times tests performed, positive rate 5 times lower.

It seems me, greater numbers purely result testing categories people, positive rate decreased greater rate number tests increased.

I think pretty clear periods significant number cases tested, see real evidence percentage missed cases much (if any) higher April now.

Why say significant number people missed now? number new cases rise, clearly lot people still spreading virus would assume people without knowing infected.

So would argue assuming many undetected cases April October justified data.

We expect positive rate higher selectively testing people likely infected would risk serious illness become infected. instead test anyone slightest symptoms would expect positive rate much lower.

But see positive rate decrease much number tests increased - suggests true number infected people might similar.

This speculation, however. fact remains *confirmed* numbers much higher April, that's thing sure about. mad no, disappointed China sending people like ""disrupt"" west, like know peon knows west movies catchphrases internet give job regardless.the USSR hand... Smart tvs, duh Yeah, didnt link single source comments like I'd asked? linking official data misinterpreting making wild extrapolations it...  proof? Jesus christ.

So again, hit sources **of claims**. Anyone misinterpret data, that's easy. want definitive claim source every coutry wrong becoming like North Korea, like claimed. can’t tell sarcasm not. damned damned situation lot us. dad 80 relatively ok health age idea long he's going around for. seen 8 months since live cross country. 

So either sit home wife, delay seeing months even perhaps risk never seeing again. carefully drive home holidays (only stopping absolutely need avoiding door areas), get tested get hope best. really many great options, guy misses I'm going end going. Make violation social distancing people wearing masks fall stand-your-ground laws. tourism spain Italy ? Belgium Czech republic nice place visit tons tourists goes everywhere. ready believe Belgian money travel want (the time Wallonia de-industrialized poor region ending). Czech, doubt earn enough travel want. Along social distancing, mask wearing, compulsory temperature checks, handwashing, mass testing.

We also wear things like face shield , bring small bottle hand sanitizer larger one car, along tissues everything.

I look US Europe I'm like. ? guys talking masks ?

It's unbelievable .

I'm Brunei , March April we've zero cases 160+ days, life resumed pre-covid. closing month steady rise coronavirus cases, including 4,115 new infections reported fourth time last seven days state reported least 4,000 new COVID-19 cases. level wasn’t hit entire month September. need know blood levels. yeah 4k safe dose. It’s antibodies can’t anything stage, it’s point patients already made antibodies there’s additional benefit adding more. government going expect this, I'd expect government pay doctors yearly salary remain standby, similar 'service allowance' paid soldier agreeing serve military discipline. “A small growing body research suggests many one 10 people get COVID-19 may fall long-hauler category.”

Why link scientific research? anybody source scientific study done matter? Well yeah lived Aus I’d probably fucking kill myself. ‘Grats 0 cases (for now) though. Country 1/10th size US perspective 

This would like 180,000 cases US 2,360 deaths Loving, NV? miserable  It’s surprising incredibly high infection rates numbers cases, people study aren’t getting infected.

Maybe it’s people enroll vaccine trial don’t feel fever major sore arm shot, kinda know got placebo, remain cautious keep masks on,” said. extra caution could depress infection rates, delaying data reveal whether vaccine works not. can't one. It'd blocked courts. Biden admitted even something simple mask mandate would deal, federal government — there’s constitutional issue whether federal government could issue mandate. don’t think constitutionally could, wouldn’t issue mandate. And, frankly, didnt even good job instituting that, either. mask celebration, lot Dodgers. believe took photo. 

However, worst part he's sitting next Dave Roberts got cancer. Yes. real estate crash coming - residential commercial. foreclose wave won’t small either side. question bad get sides. amazing buying opportunities waves forecloses hit 2021.

Several large companies quietly laying lot people - AKA firing making sign NDA’s order get severance everything stays radar. Quite game played behind scenes.

The politics much play time around. Way many variables play moment. Feel much comfortable sidelines... ready pounce market multiple severe dips (I expect multiple dips time around) also make sure ready jump real estate opportunities.

Regardless, always lot $$ made economies. need play hands right - already nice dry run earlier year.

Good luck there! Wait actually gets cold. We've mild autumn country. “Don’t get hopes happy ending, accept liberties restricted even solutions, forget live fear virus, we’ll make sure remind absolutely times”- Media, everywhere, every day since March wrong friend. Good times make soft people. Fucking boomers guess confirmed positive now, initially reported otherwise. Regardless, ""inconclusive"" result go Turner. lack command English indicates otherwise. Ah yes force people socially isolate indefinitely, I'm sure never backfire negative effects. all, taught Reddit School Medicine. I’m hoping Bergamo type situation happens here. don’t anticipate things getting bad really seems like shit get bad time next months. France 

Maybe that's France it, lot people sub U.S. throbbing hard lockdowns. state (very obvious) fact sustainable given way country set up, scream call grandma killer right wing nutjob.

I thought something take early. studies showing reduced hospital stays. Also along Philippines country blessed freedom (tm) democracy (tm) Mother America.

Another country that's also vein India. three countries done horribly COVID mention whole country still deeply mired poverty illiteracy . mad Ivanka? Maybe go release dad's energy, know mean doesn't. time can't lump others living true Christian testimony. like saying humans killers ppl murder. Stop blaming one subset ppl everything bad eggs. Well done! Yup.. $1250/dose. something even shown work... 

I wonder many N95s $375 million respirator factory could produce day? Welcome back guys. Let's try again! course! :) never find proof actually stop reinfection COVID-19. 

Do any? doesnt really matter vaccine timeline. Either way going wait November 15th safety data apply per 2 month FDA requirement.  300k doses really much considering getting 70-90k new cases per day. We're currently around 45k hospitalized point number growing. What's more, we're talking doses, I'm assuming people need multiple doses. I've heard several sports radio shows saying understand went back out. finally reached ultimate goal. damage already done. played 6 innings maskless already. 

I agree still chance infection, maybe team wanted there.

The MLB lucky Dodgers won. happens actually infected players sides? game 7 can't happen everyone quarantine. ....he test positive. isolate quarantine. grownup. getting here? Almost? Face it. economy tourism. yet somehow, 40% Americans okay president handling pandemic.

My faith country almost completely gone point wins again, I'm going lie guys, I'll done. gf moving another country soon Americans allowed countries again. going check samples late last year. countries found traces it, I'm sure US could also.

Before anyone starts, trying say originate China, I'm sure earlier cases China also important information. Thanks posting this! Romanians kiss ""moaste"" {dead bodies} every year. think great God help us.
Suck fking bullshit 100 deaths day. people like non mask wearers, that’s big consequence. They’ve told, believe it’s worse flu, say different political reasons. worked behavior interventionist? really can’t job zoom. need quarantine HI anymore closed March-September. numbers extremely low since reopening past month, probably 75%. lost two biggest fundraising events year too. I’m hanging sure future since covid numbers continue rise. visitors town, locals members staying away. Crazy world.. effect. think big problem lot people starting bad place economically. see many young people dont really put lot effort job career. spend bunch money vehicle need ""a good car"".  bought tore foreclosure ten years ago. know kids 20s spend cars couple years house cost.  I've become conservative financially throughout years started nothing almost every place I've ever worked gone.  I've gone work throughout this, also greatly limited trips out. laid bit beginning. I've done lot landscaping work house. disappointing amount people yelling ""you can't live fear"" ignoring medical experts advice.  numbers going area truly know happen. wish could pull together find better way. ????

the cut get vaccinated, control state county. case opened up, kids got sick, one died. think lives worth 1-2 semesters would miss.

I lack empathy families, feel like shouldnt even debate. great title. see there.

Is paperwork required? Orwellian nightmare... Achomlished"" wish people shared sentiment. Unfortunately many blindly party loyal Dems see way. Lol like downvoted. Corona folks also like facts goes narrative. Oh dont say NO/DK/SE similar, found random skip Denmark, country similar, include Finland. answer probably hidden fact Denmark - right - bad Sweden autumn would show used charts article. Norway actually following similar response mid March changed strategy resulted death rate one 10th Swedens, Brittons estimate lives saved could add another 500 so. ""Ended"" would mean ended.  ""Ending"" means nothing. shitty that's works Current death rate Denmark higher Sweden. looking total numbers again? That's happens populace doped national rhetoric ideology fail see even basic truths regards health security.

It's like moths mistaking lamp moon flying around circling die. worst part people already complaining wear mask. guess dumbass global thing, unfortunately. hey, tomorrow least tell idiot looking them. Lol. Well, mom told dad, long term care, tested positive. friends worried everyone thinks are. tell stupid think they’re being. one stands right thing. literally save lives.  - Shops, restaurants, bars, non essential businesses closed.
- Need certificate go home (like go buy groceries)
- get work work needs physical presence: factories, agriculture, construction sites
- Kids go school let adults telework home

One week ago: open except bars, universities couple places day, need stay home 9pm 6am need source claim? Theres article every day sub he's saying need national mask mandate go well 2021. Everything said true. responsibility type google easily can.

Heres something you. think current measures necessary 65 virus deadly. listed source CDC below. clearly see age 45, total deaths everything including covid, pneumonia flu 7k TOTAL. conveniently dont even column covid lump everything together. Weird huh? Even next two age groups bad. 65 clearly risk. Also phenomenon covid. Literally every infectious disease acts way yet mandate masks, tank economy multiple tens millions people poverty result unable get job. Even more, CDCs latest estimates put overall IFR age 49 .02% .5% 50-69. way way less initial 4-5% overall regardless age initially thought back march reason initial shutdowns. data clear. Open everything back go back business usual. sick stay home. visit grandma feeling well wear mask like cautious elderly (which anyways disease). irreparable harm measures way worse actual problem. claim otherwise completely deny science facts people like ardently love claim for.

Source deaths age group: 7 months seeing widespread reinfections. There's really argument Yup, full people don’t take life fucking seriously, like you. represent 10% society far left right live day day lives righting wrongs gods work. 

Keep up! rest us don’t care, living lives happily, confronting random people shit doesn’t matter day day. 

Whenever you’ll find another problem enforce superiority complex through. are, all, smarter rest us country. Scientists careful. say precisely mean. people that, people understand that.

 'Vaccine produces significant immune response adults' means - nothing more. able see significant response. see 'cure', see 'solution'. know bit work. 

They know one thing: vaccine provokes reaction disease. Could everything, could nothing. reaction. careful, cautious words.

The average person, afraid desperate, want 'slow, steady precise'. want damn answer. want cure. want stop worrying. read words should. 

The reporters simply write researchers stated. fail provide context, understanding anyone grasp scientists frame things. did, statements would make sense people.

If researcher says response, happened. say cure, is. say anything factually, provably (if good, course!).

A significant response means saw increase immune cells microscope blood sample. able detect higher levels specific chemicals blood associated immune responses. test subjects reported symptoms immune response - glands swelled, felt little shitty, sort thing.

That means. Sure administration done well handling pandemic, majority blame bad gotten lie American population obey rules respect others. murica bad hurt anything, not? like distancing. Fucking people gross can't believe allowed breathe food. Yeah, sounds waaay short. mean stated plan isn’t keep things anywhere near stopped time either.  employed Korea easily transferrable countries. Due privacy rights, less displined society on... coming Czechia, lockdown curfew night, mask mandate yet still among worst world. Gradually lift measures infection rates match hospital capacity, vaccine, summer. 😂 people try wrong absolutely everything? Seriously. Everything post full easily disprovable objectively wrong income households likely want business reopen even COVID-19 isn’t iis good bad? [Not *at least* reopened schools person classes early on. Children get sick often. spread it. agree. Also, reading helps anxiety, so... Thanks alright. summers would die :p  really understand came conclusion. 0.18% two positive tests 45 days they....just guessed reinfections?

And course, seem take account bias problem lots people get reinfected would asymptomatic even get tested twice.

Edit: also, time two swabs 2 months. maybe that's risk reinfection 2 months? um Oh yeah, get. asymptomatic people walking around masks like today (at least live). consider spending holidays loved ones ""trivial"", feel bad you. Again, wrong want happen, ""trivial"" thing give up. don’t know happening place could go supermarket liquor store. Besides everything shut including public parks really know either users are. 🏅 *sooo many*

Names 6. 

*sooooooo many tho* American. never really locked down. Businesses closed, never forced stay home. Wait find racist italians corrupt government lmao editorializing leaning fear be

Like what?

Everyday hit grim milestones, we're better; we're worse worse. Maybe one worst countries entire planet COVID, media report such! I’ve tested California I’ve gotten results email. can’t imagine North Dakota would stronger privacy laws California. shitty lockdown, public schools still open universities closed. semi-lockdown here, I'm glad measures place get cases ICU occupation french elvel. explained, hospital simply resort denying care people certain age people look like recover. 20 year old skiing accident victim prioritized 70 year old COVID victim. hospital management job well, they'll make sure doctors nurses get work handle. seems like numbers pulled backside though. Assuming IFR would jump .5-1% way 24% medical intervention bit presumptive. 

Are 24% people gotten tested positive result even admitted hospitals?(keeping mind large amount people don’t get tested either mild symptoms Asymptomatic even number greater 24%, IFR wouldn’t 24%) study spammed everywhere sub days ago incorrect?  good paying job I'm lucky part working poor long time experienced first hand besides living tent. dental work needs done covered insurance can't get taken care of. I'll likely home I'm 40. many friends growing experiencing various levels well. know people personally died virus. sheltered personally mean effect real people cascading effect eventually spill lane.

Stop running defense monsters power ruining country telling people tune out. horrible advice coming touch ivory tower they’re even close. You’d know research all. I'm Georgia. remember governor opened state less month. save business (mostly small business) Georgia heavily criticised even Trump. Guess what? Cases never spiked higher level surrounding states.

Georgia lockdown, request directive ignored. seems high probability vaccines treatments could bring fatality rate 2 3X flu rather initial fear 10X flu back beginning. current death rate? Still 10X average population (25-65)? I'm not. first, *only*, account. one account Moyu Squad, members squad include Torrent 10Pesjidi Well key deference invected ( average 40 years ) significant younger spring (52 years). slowly increasing. 
I mean Germany hast 2 highest average age World, behind Japan infections spread eldery popularity screwed. huge majority people infected middle age ranges 21-40 years 41-60 years. can't see point school kept open. get school bring back people lockdown, month time reopen numbers enough Sure, global pandemic hurricane, figure business owner. Here, government “figured out” deciding going broad shutdown. 

“Chose” work office environment. Another statement reeking privilege. 

If possible lockdown month, eradicate virus (something western country done likely always impossible USA), provide financial support needed directly businesses needed it, wouldn’t done that? country comparable US done that? point even pandemic, people wearing masks time, unless high pollution area. initial point already stretched pretty thin. science says go back normal point. Fauci said that. That’s eased restrictions equivalency ~24,500 daily cases comparing US rates.

As 7 day average, France hasn’t since late August. Yep. Merkel's message whole way - despite government say, us act best us around us. magic cure, promises. Soon heard news went aldi stocked food. need leave house run weeks except exercise. everyone gives good go chance bring numbers right Okay. Let's add Germany, Denmark, Norway list, although sample size deaths quite small. make good argument lot Europe giving credit to.  Wholeheartedly disagree theatre. believe government laws it. many localities specify can't wear mesh masks. Yeah threw numbers around logic still holds... somehow. wish would lockdown January. wants go involuntarily cold, shitty month? might easier convince people stay home months actually felt nice icy roads. brand different? recall large dosage affecting (but like 10 years ago) smaller dosage either. Im way anti-mask, anti-lockdown whatsoever, serious matter trust decide best. comes germany also see 82 Million population currently 3.000 people hospitals half serious condition. people else put money.

Exactly this. S&amp;P three times higher 10 years ago, dividends paid remained basically same. People paying 3 times return. Why?

Because wealthiest 10% people 90% stocks country nothing else money invest it. mean like dingo fence South Australia? I'm Texas even cases here. 7000 one day day. El Paso, TX run hospital beds flying people Dallas hour 20 minute flight away. 

A lot people state still wear masks socially distance. local Facebook group, discussion today Halloween. People refusing stop trick 'r treating saying ""kids suffer."" concept suffering actually though. me, true suffering losing parent grandparent preventable virus. them, suffering able wear costume get candy random strangers. mindset crazy everywhere here. They're collectivist cultures. *choose* fall line rest society common good, ostracized. Asian countries round send firing squad conform.

Also fines help. Singapore people walking around issuing fines anyone without masks. Wear mask pay 300 bucks- rocket science. believe Vietnam also issues fines. There's point rules enforced. heard folks. random guy internet knows he’s talking career epidemiologists actual scientists. mandate hoping for? Americans resist another lockdown, especially comes Joe Biden. ban restaurants day scapegoat look like action taken. Masks helps aren’t covid killer people claim area. 

You can’t simply mandate virus away. open spots hospitals means heart attacks much likely fatal. means people wait much longer broken bones. means stress strain staff, mistakes.

A hospital handle 20 gunshot victims day handle well suddenly 50-100 shootings day.

It gets worse COVID, many COVID patients need hospital bed o2 longer durations patients. I'm sure ""everything closed work"" less harsh morale full lockdown population tough. know often said American public short attention span, I'm absolute awe we've started moving past something that's actively killing us. LMFAO funny watching progression Yeah really work everyone ignores precautions needed flatten curve. think talking asian countries handle it. cold wear mask politeness people contact  believe eligible Pakistani citizenship. impressive, better current state America! prevent ICUs becoming overloaded people dying waiting rooms can't get proper medical care? 

Yeah, rinse repeat get vaccine treatment ventilators (to keep ICUs ventilators clear). Ever-growing division fueled media; radical vocal extremists sides (who openly use violence); basic civility respect people opposite aisle really foundation all. School, work, essential travel. Doesn’t sound like lockdown. document they're talking one linked to, seems quicker summary it. found one they're talking googling quoted section ""Highlights include: ENDING COVID-19 PANDEMIC"" Since White House proclamations powerful proclaim economy full recovered, unemployment 0%, use negative % since supporters cant tell difference, he's proclaim Jesus reborn, Abraham Lincoln. heard “a weeks” “flatten curve months ago. surprised, staff must getting lot isolate. unsustainable alas... man like actually sheltered society like completely unaware sociology acceptable humans get back lives, nothing proud of. /u/blazingsaint Thanks response, tend agree. think meant reply previous poster! think Asian countries you’re referencing used lockdown effectively one point another. I’m 90-day awesome lockdown closed borders, treating, tracing, subsidies camp. Re-contain, re-open widely solid protocols 400. tried 1000 horrible. decreased 400 still felt bad. Starting look like tidal wave. fatality rate jump 1%(that’s high estimate) 24% aka increase 23%? Even assume absolutely 0 medical care, insane assumption, seems crazy. 

Also numbers coming from? Seriously? There's 18 countries front USA testing per million population. USA second total tests behind china. Yes even believe science? disregard rules, regulations, guidelines?

That's truth. I'd like see leader actually lead... I'm seeing much all. Lots denial, failure take action, excuses though. Sure helping. Politicians needed boost public health offices instigate strict measures provide protection vulnerable.

Agreed. That's job. even refuse outright fail, ultimately responsibility falls us individual level right thing -- best keep eachother safe. remember elected official fails us -- vote out!

Sorry hear FIL. Hoping fast full recovery. lockdown/shutdown means gatherings homes. get would impossible stop it, many would comply immediately, many would punished hope would deter others we're talking highly addictive drugs hijack brain, we're talking seeing family dinner. done. already vaccine already given tens millions. know many gotten including old people seems working. Nope. Dow drops 900 points election uncertainty. explicitly allowed even encouraged current administration. point buck stops top. love people say old people know better. faced 10% chance getting virus dieing losing 20% remaining lifespan lockdown, gonna look like toss shitty governments shithole countries.  lot coworkers NY, believe lockdown roughly ones Europe.  restrict outdoor recreation allow schools work would big brain move Honest answer: social 5,5-year-old adaptable understanding. took shit well beginning. loosen rules home (screen time etc) course, big change all, really see serious consequence shit. Come September, school opened, send 3 weeks. went kindergarten last year honestly intention sending school year. what, starts year later, right? 

However. started seeing signs affecting ways understand beginning. much shorter fuse, prone outbursts, afraid general more... clingy? know right word, parent know kids want lot stuff time even need obvious support, kind regressed regard. 

This shit we're going easy anyone obviously. I'm still thinking pulling back weather gets really cold classroom time, risk EITHER way. felt like I'm sacrificing mental health future potential low risk physical health (if read studies kids know I'm talking about). Since beginning whole thing thought pull without future consequences bar physical health, can't really 100% sure all, I? 

Being parent scarier ever. want right kid. absolutely hard know right though since stood sides argument now. I'm schools, them. want kid safe healthy, physically mentally. Went camping weekends ago across lake tractor pull competition. Lots beer, confederate flags, red caps masks. Homeworking mandatory, recommended. add teachers staff, factory workers, hospital workers, public servants maybe half office workers .... that's millions people still going around about. lockdown slow virus bit much good. OK sorry, promise copy paste comments way again. Morocco seem agree lot us right now, though. August 11, 2020:
""Mr Putin said vaccine passed required checks, adding daughter already given it.

Officials said plan start mass vaccination OK tbf prob right, doubt become quite entrenched Asia. underestimate ingrained become people sheer shock horror.

We still dutifully follow airport security procedures nearly 20 years 9/11 even though actual instances airline terrorism pretty low (and killed waaay less people). 

So underestimate wedded get safety precautions we're used them. Doctors can't quit. Romania resignations forbidden.

If quit doctor could go jail. every piece evidence shows lockdowns widened wealth gap US, right binary lives livelihoods need aware public health measures adverse impact latter. Work public services. watch Macron's speech basing comment vague title? possibility, serious people saying that.

Vaccines coming soon. get yours, COVID likely within risk tolerance able go bars hang fun again. rite aid/pharmacy brand. brand use? adjustment period initially took large dose? attractive are. think good argument lockdowns though ignoring virus catastrophic.

How know? countries ignored virus? ""The National Board Health Welfare's information deceased differs somewhat presented daily Swedish Public Health Agency. depend origin statistics. Swedish Public Health Agency reports deceased people laboratory-verified covid-19 died within 30 days. National Board Health Welfare reports cases underlying cause death covid-19, regardless whether diagnosis laboratory confirmed not.""

You read last PDF (Swedish would think key: 
""The National Board Health Welfare's statistics provide verified medical description causes death long term official statistics Sweden regarding causes death.""

Usually deaths handled Socialstyrelsen (National Board Health Welfare) Skatteverket (The Tax Authorities). ok laugh :) mask help limiting asymptomatic people spread shit everywhere think safe say significant part US, politics regular life, done pandemic.

And political landscape basically focusing election right now, nothing else matters. see Republicans also Democrats nobody really anything.

If people dying thousands, it. least Nov 3, nothing really changing. that, we'll see doubt anything new political power actually changing hands January (or Trump stays office all). that's least 2 months worth infections deaths that's basically already decided.

The interesting thing point looking Europe. I'm really sure people adhere new measures too.

Even governments propose libraries worth new restrictions, everyone wants flaut time enforcement arbitrary, work. none governments long-term plan, go right straight around christmas/new years. back February, aunt visited another country. days later began feel ill diagnosed influenza A. However, throughout whole sickness, never really felt like flu. usually get flu year immune system terrible felt completely different. anybody know studies possible misdiagnosis influenza covid? (especially whole pandemic took US) yet still force us send kids school allow close contact without mask. dumbfounded. KN-95's, also pack N-95's. KN-95's mask wear 99% time. feel foolproof though, since noticeably feel air escaping around sides. Yes, read said - Aug Putin said vaccine passed required checks, adding daughter already given it.

Officials said plan start mass vaccination October."" normal circumstances holidays trivial, become trivial pandemic. yep went even farther 942 points fired one week today, regardless happens election night. France lockdown much lockdown. Kids still go school people still go work employers want to.  Sweden fine.

The good old ""Swedish Exception"".  think could mistaken it’s 2x 55 gets higher every decade. drastically underscores areas did. vast majority optional businesses shut pretty wide variety places. closing restaurants. Unless worked essential store, part infrastructure government, could work home, probably shut least month. Thank you! people cabin fever already, shutdown going create issues. need government take leadership role start guiding/nudging citizens right direction. need media/social media start taking responsibility information produce allow users generate. we're allowing misinformation run ramped. Anecdotal. even 1 second research? 

[US crime rates](http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm) steadily decreasing throughout recent history. 20% decrease total crimes 2010.

Homelessness lower today 10 years ago, 2010. [10% decrease nationwide. fuelled purely internet media. Without it, would happened. argument made whether justified. 

Most problems head result toxic media internet. pandemic look deaths hospitalizations.

Oh missed daily excel 97 table maybe time they'll implement test &amp; trace system actually works learn Israel, can't proper lockdown still schools open. see going work kids going school in-person. mental fiscal strain lockdown ignored undervalued, IMO.

Sounds like still job home! Must nice!

I promise feels like fiscal strain lockdown undervalued begging scraps see point living. properly valued, would stimulus bigger outcry employed.

Also clear, I'm industry would halted even without legal lockdown, I'm advocating open whatever. thats us officials stupid, time build hospitals hire doctors/nurses, contact tracing late back march spread nationally, masks shutdowns wayy late already know vaccine.

its like goes mental hospital say think chicken, point we're looking group therapy meds, need egg. stop bs though. stay open minded medias, mean people act less ignorant. i'm sure canada issues, cities literally fire here. one save academics economists (who completely ignored) thought second would last months. Read book.  SAID!!!!!! long qualify people administer dosages Excuse possibly explain operating assumption know caravan bullshit, simply think Democrats thing reverse. think terrorists streaming across border time anyway.  People also liked compare weeks covid deaths entire year flu. g made sense, would take excuse dismiss virus, either wanted feel tougher everyone else want admit trouble. last 2 weeks I've physically un-well worried current state got COVID may die it. Fortunately body healing (don't drugs kids, least, lot drugs months end..), bring COVID, body ready. Population Texas 28 million. Even 1% death rate total US population got infected you’re looking max 3.3 million deaths. way total deaths US high Texas. General population see vaccine till least Summer. logistics issues already huge that's shit we've anticipated. knows hell happen Trump torpedos FEMA, CDC FDA tantrum ship sinks. even worse. People back common sense responsible themselves, health income. never forced stay home.

Denver shelter place orders. ask anyone uyghur descent anyone Hong Kong anyone criticized party 🤭 totally like government extreme censorship monitoring people.

Maybe like brainwashed would fit nicely r/sino

Everything delusion likely think America actually China lmao Yes no. say ventilator healthcare Sweden. I'm talking settings. school shopping malls. like right now! Yeah same. boss asshole get understand collective effort make come document. tough compared first lockdown? Schools open think construction aswell? seems slightly lighter compared March helps media, Politicians shift focus deaths, dropping like rock

? inaugurated January (IF wins), could build cabinet teams could hit ground running approved confirmed. one remains office? hang now. push immunity see hundreds thousands dead. I’m flying Uk. business February 2021 probably upgrade mask N95 cautious. would mask use flight throughout airports. Probably use entire stay there. rate increase cases, next government may nationalize hospitals / directly fund stay afloat. 1. looked KCDC stats, less 20%, even accounting unknown cluster-starting sources.

2. gov know people get infected, measures inefficient harmful.

After reading hundreds papers spread, see uncertainty least one order magnitude min. aerosol infection times max. fomite droplet survival. Unfortunately, extrema values require different government responses. end sight shit.

Summer '22, sadly. Summer '21 lot better dark ass winter. someone translate English me? Lol Assuming Constitutional crises narcissist refuses accept results reality. sycophant SCOTUS appointments rubber stamp baseless claims middle shit tornado Randy. *division zero* need scientist conclude comparable black plague. middle ground ""it's hoax"" ""it's end world"". *normal* procedure dealing people endanger public health.

You must understand normal Korea western world. 

I'd also like add currently wake day less less rights, overall huge amounts people trust governments due corruptions constant scandals. America (not there) see incredibly divided election ends days choose two corrupt 70+ year old senile millionaires ton scandals dont represent average joe realistic chance dying office. Essentially better policy makers winning one better propaganda.

It's cases like many start governments flat lied (which might find acceptable not) masks save everyone defunding embezzling money healthcare. country scientists yet give actual scientific evidence keep sharing ""opinions"" changed likely 5 times already. people distrustful institutions rightly so.

How get bad bros? Without stricter enforcement harsher penalties, what's preventing happening again? Good lord. Fauci never said pandemic would go away spring. docs look injecting disinfectants. rounding corner cases hit new highs.  prior administration messed Covid testing. on. even realm. literally compendiums bullshit put much. youve become incapable coherently describing reality, case, maybe rethink Republicans president, let adjourn go home without fight. fights anyone remotely disagrees with, time. Why? care. say masks would voluntary Americans caring public health anything said? 

my prediction masks mandatory small number settings settings mask-free. way, stores stay open, toilet paper enough people still runnimg around couple packs like tomorrow like probably thought moving Canada trump won. fun living rest life America lol doctor, fuck you. lol. believe Biden wins virus disappear 😂 it’s snowing live indoor dining recently banned due spike cases. summer I’d BBQs friends back yard play games online together talk funny things pets day. wonder guys state un. bunch morons Americans are. theweek.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Interesting see responses. point, restaurants reopen places like schools, gyms, movie theaters, on. Figuring minimize transmission settings important.

I know US audience, large swathes world reopen restaurants now, especially adjust design. discussing friends US seem lacking, mostly thinking cultures different. ""fuck you, got mine cost worth long freedom &lt;insert 

Which know, cool, that's fine situations. particularly conducive emergency like this. Yes listen hitler aids... it’s curious little masks seem worn states 😐😐 believe nothing change next year. pandemic accompany us least one year, 2. 

&amp;#x200B;

We hope find way keep numbers low constantly instead huge outbreaks  argument public education aside, kids need place socialize peers. mandatory education, still avenues that. stay-at-home order, nowhere go that. people interact household. Nah, bad guys basically wanted slap bandaid torn artery. side knew needed blood flow going stopped. insane. nothing normal global pandemic. glad I’m Queenslander/Australian LoL least admit silver spoon goon.

Please point one post I've made would make think beyond warped media saturated lizard brain JCJ needs run higher office. He’s one people trust here. Meanwhile live Collin county north judge poll greets maskless, corona, press release saying feels fine, offering 0 apology may affected Thank goodness governor, Kristi Noem led crisis!!Oh, wait.Shes there?She state campaigning Trump’s loser train.?Well, SD guess you’re one. Lockdowns meant sto cases fast saturation near, that's last resort. NEW RECORD FUCK YEA AMERICA put cute everyone march Wins clean making back way was! Well.... mean what's lose. Unfortunately that's sad reality. 30 minutes...20 minutes...10 minutes...yet tests taking like 3 days. you’re outside around contagious person period time (15 minutes guess, shorter times accumulate 15 minutes) get sick. protests aren’t good example people wearing masks. 

Just wear mask safe. It’s big deal. anything cases. forever. 6-8 weeks everyone adhering it. phased opening masks social distancing contact tracing. Covid antibodies last 3 months. gain immunity get stronger. get reinfected again. I’m Australian. it. everyone’s best interests eliminate virus. start, government force Facebook/Twitter etc delete extreme conspiracy groups/posts helping spread hazardous misinformation. one allowed travel outside region

Suggests internal borders shut travel. Supermarkets essential stores (unknown yet would be) remain open still go there. Keyboard warrior downvote. use words? thought 40% voters, comes 20% total population. let bring down, that's they're after. rest Australia covid free months (nsw exception odd single figure cases). shitting country managed near eradicate successfully. Melbourne staggered return normal aggressive case management. know I'd rather Yes stay region land in. Don’t mad got born parents lazy. 

Also, seem like misanthrope wants lockdown avoid people. I’m still social, vacationing, get togethers. sound like antisocial one. Lockdown worked, bought quite months, work again. problem *between* lockdowns ultimately failure. Lockdowns sustainable measure keep going into, devastating (economically, socially psychologically) last resort virus growing control France stage last resort needed avoid total hospital overflow fact put potentially late. Ireland acted weeks earlier doubling period shrank 10 days cases going threat hospitals (Irish health system far less capacity per capita France Sweden Belgium) is, now, likely avoided extra months. Within month possible surge France still bound exceed happened April. Hopefully time come (and Ireland, others) institute rigorous TTI system like South Korea. thing whether they, lot countries, pull properly another question. reposting r/NoShitSherlock work actually. people government stupid ended lockdown abruptly letting everyone go everywhere, causing second wave.

Should gradually opened starting mandatory masks curfew opening little little.
Also stricter border control.

But starts people selfish idiots. Yeah, that’s right. Shutting country wouldn’t equal 2 million dead, even collateral damage. That’s dishonest. Donald said started Sept. 19 Camden went cardiac arrest, quit breathing, multiple seizures family fishing ""We pulled recliner onto floor, started CPR her. sent wife, cell service, sent wife find landline call 911,"" said. Camden first transported hospital Mountain Home, doctors said 25% chance survival. **According Donald, 25% dropped 1% diagnosed 


So got Covid already hospital unrelated condition lowered already dismal chance survival. Ah, optimist see! Bet want pay wall young, live life. safe respectful...where masks required get tested/quarantine around older family members (or aren’t taking seriously fuck it). that, strike balance Perhaps aware outcomes arent simply ""live"" ""die"" would careful. news coming long term effects scary. 75% locked down... ""Partial lockdown"" wow. guess ""99.9%"" problem, right? /s surprise downvoted moved proved wrong. I've seen people lived 8 years can't say anything except ""Hello"" Korean.

Even complete idiot, try hard among worst offenders among teacher tourists. agree leadership know big failures humans are, average, right thing.  registered accounts equivalent 401K sort blanket term IRAs? listened speech Macron said internal borders (i.e. Schengen/EU borders) would remain open, external borders (non-Schengen/EU) would remain closed. But, before, people would always allowed cross border France return home. Nothing like daddy's money make misanthrope right? destroy society lockdown poor people get poorer rich fine bec lockdown already. I’d [buy yes! exactly 6. Lockdowns coming soon? waiting for? People sleeping fact already seeing real immediate affects global warming. We're already tied 2nd time history (other 2005) named storms year. we're 2 months ahead record we'll certainly week now. 

And maybe next year many year keep going average. addition tied year (again 2 months earlier last time) nearly every named storm formed earlier last year. They're also getting powerful average. Oh 2005 El Nino year. one isn't. gonna get far far worse. Right. 28. got experience going university partying socializing comes it. lifelong relationships build others, mistakes learn from, experiences general something easily replaced.

I married daughter wonderful lady met one classes college. pretty good chance would never even met something like pandemic occurring time. 

With much fun cherished memories time life, hard sympathize taken away indefinitely paused. easy look outside perspective say ""Tough cookies, pandemic, deal it."", lot young adults asked put exciting times lives hold. think lot harder lot people willing admit. even commit making profit this. Fuck blood sucking weasels.  mean? Total cases roughly Europe double population.  never vietnam war ... like covid /s

Fyi: conflict, never declared war ever kids homeschooled full time must really fucked up. Telling country 330 million people 'do country does' makes literally zero sense. change, government do, enforced, exactly one us doing? 

That's like telling homeless man ""Lol like bill gates dude!"" would really like see Hessen. far nothing local schools. hope Wisconsin start paying businesses stay close reduced capacity nah dolphins gonna rise ocean take over. missed. didn’t work well March supposed wear mask avoid spreading older, vulnerable people. close retirement homes IMHO  house WAY better living apartment right now.

 apt building around 60 people living it, maybe 3 people besides wear masks we're hallways, community laundry room, etc.

 never get elevator anymore, live top floor building :(

I fucking hate neighbors atm. Yeah like good argument every while. clearly too, you’ve raging reddit months sure high horse comes from. 

Lol upper middle? Fuck peasants Im firmly 0.01%. relax 47th floor luxury apartment downtown toronto continue large parties. don’t think allowing people go outside would prevent lockdown working, restriction basically imposed reason average person's fault. 
Most kids subpar education due various factors. said support keeping school's open certain age. sort hybrid system older ones. Work online allow appointments need extra support meet teachers person.

Edit: ideal keeping schools open, closing difficult enough support parents work whilst young children school. pay cent get EUA requires proving drug works. don’t want get beaten up

My girlfriend works liquor store major vacation ground. asked old dickweed put mask threatened hurt her. 4'11. Dude like six foot. Fuck people. Still increases chances death. flue around long time, still kills every year. need vaccine smart.  scientific rebuttal since seem know better? genuinely shocked. reading reddit twitter thought Karens boomers refusing wear masks socially distance. Thanks. got wrong headline says “opening weekend.” Thanks correction. see Democrats deliberately making bill unpalatable Republicans. Democrats really wanted something pass, could lighter bill addresses immediate concerns negotiated first.

Will Republicans reject simple cash payout program? No. would Dems want boost Reps so? No. hate character. suuuuuure, time chorus humanity complain inconveniences destruction climate change throwing lives chaotic uncertainty. societies again, naive assume somehow different? 

claims cautious optimism aside, don’t think society returns “normal” time soon, ever again. known stake decades. refused failed act. it’s tough pill swallow. return normal you’re slowly driven toward edge cliff.

people don’t like change will. don’t like routines interrupted accord. god forbid universe come exert power remind us life much fragile give credit. hide behind god, free will, control ones destiny long. stay-at-home order doesn’t make exception school, kids supposed socialize in-person? can’t go anywhere.

(I edited comment make sense) Well, put perspective, point system changed year.

It used could get long term residency visa literally 0 income long got enough points cultural assimilation categories like Korean language ability, volunteer work, passing culture class Korean Immigration Naturalization Aptitude Test, etc.

Now, that's longer possible get visa literally nothing high paying job get paid enough. even said announcement making easier highly paid individuals get visa... people probably get combination cultural assimilation points 30k 40k year income, norm individual median income Korea. make like 120k year, set. even need know Korean well...

The general consensus change made prevent influx Southeast Asian immigrants getting long term residency visas via cultural assimilation despite low income earners... Korea still pretty racist, even today :/  sure earth would keep EU borders open - adding reinfection, unless EU border cross quarantined 14 days? 

And can't travel regions, mean border crosser stay region land in? gf thought thing. can't put another four years this, stupid allowed happen first place. viable skillsets, could probably make happen. government job support public crisis none concerns valid. problem isn’t lockdowns, governments should. one wants things you’re saying. seem think government shouldn’t couldn’t actually responsible population, wrong assumption, mirror selfish views sociopath  sound like five year old think anyone long term plan this. Ireland locked hard March July, cases fell 10/15 day things slowly opened back government started espousing phrases like 'living Covid' another lockdown happen work. 

Flash forward October cases start shooting back we're another lockdown, 5km travel restrictions hundreds thousands jobs gone country going massive debt paying covid unemployment benefits. Government admitted plan vaccine appears. Similar happening Europe. Well $1200 Also, immunity isn’t permanent, means catch again, chance dying time.

Nothing certain theories emerging becomes endemic likely fade severity. shit? Less risk means less prevention measures. People allergic bees take preventative actions around bees people aren't, exact reason. I'm Dutch I'm it, long speak language. Okay, lady Socialstyrelsen reporting IVA status saying clearly ""med respirator"" - r/testsyouwillneverheardaboutagain made posts Preventing people going outside unnecessary, people go walks lockdown still work thought mention inflation comment.

Anyway, think know inflation guaranteed behave way future (you said forward) past months. What's government supposed do? People sides ignoring virus point. Look EU. People care anymore. He/she's bored nothing do. used killing time. Even individual young person basis, thought it’s simple small numbers dying vs vast majority experiencing minor temporary symptoms. 

There 30 year old recently fit preexisting conditions lost significant lung function. many long Covid stories young people. don’t %’s also factored. 

I get though. 15-29 want socialising, relationships, waking hangover stories previous night. sympathise. What’s point? bars restaurants work school crowded places fucking kidding me? handle it? School incredibly damaging children. Public education recent invention relative human history. opinion children think send virtual prison day else lives fall apart? staying home day unable go movies fly visit relatives holidays going weddings funerals zoom resembles normal you? guess different definitions . obviously, change fact survival rate greatly improved Im gonna comment since 99.9% redditors liberals... oh wait. (Reuters) - Swiss hospitals scrambling cope surge new COVID-19 patients, bringing back retired staff replace sick frontline workers closing wards officials warn could reach breaking point 10 days. People refuse anything past summer 2021. Wether good depends things point, way government able enforce measures past Point vaccine candidates need refrigerated well zero spoil? Lol, arent going get widespread distribution long time Yes, restate question well, except worry stages lead collapsed systems. would expect, example, hospital open ICU beds, exhausted overworked nursing staff would noticeably worse outcomes. guess I'm predicting case counts pass threshold, quality care declines, figure hard measure quantify this. confirm.
From south. stupid. No, don't! Stop accusing ""trolling"" disagree something! really feel like US next 

Seems like December time Except time braindead guns pissed Obviously cousin. kink production capacity. vaccines started production probability approved. help bit, capacity 1 000 000 doses per day going take days get 7 000 000 000 even ramping production capacity alongside partners. good possibility many infected opportunity vaccine.    Ha! almost got quote right ;) Trump going leave Biden real shit show Republicans going everything power see Democrats fail. Nearly quarter million dead.  lulled false sense thinking, ""hey maybe we'll actually use crisis come together collective purpose public health."" anti-maskers starting appear yeah know rest lived it. Since fairly theoretical, many people actually twice? much dependence observational studies, except area would relevant. 45 million cases worldwide. I’ve read handful purported repeat infections. **But said... oh well. Youth future cities anymore.** Maybe time weather pretty shit moment unlike 1st lockdown. much hosnestly apart staying home. That's Pfizer's capacity, however, know includes facilities making vaccine. BioNTech producing European supply. Pfizer US. CEO Pfizer talking. 

Also, there's high chance China refusing western vaccine pressing allies same, knock billion people list vaccinated one. Russia also wildcard similar reasons. 

Moderna Pfizer also similar vaccines similar data throughout phases. There's high chance one works, will, potentially doubling doses.

Lastly, current production plans, one found viable, significant efforts ramping production. local police won’t enforce coronavirus mandates area. Nothing done except voting new sheriff follow rules. Ah... plenty wannabe ""cowboys"" think hard lifted trucks I'm sure would buckle pretty easily.  think much different positivity 26%. I'm curious: high crazy high? Gotcha totally agreed that.  feel like stricter shorter get back control. what's dangerous, less costly cut. School dangerous stop education extended period important consequences

Not saying correct way deal this, way chosen answer logic Reddit wealth eye opening exchanges since beginning 2020. least every day participate platform, echo sentiments. can’t believe people exist. absolutely chilling. 

It’s difficulty accepting different human beings without respective programming inherited dispositions. It’s much ideology I’ve encountered nonsensical rabidly dangerous. breaks fucking brain. 

The terrifying part it- me- realizing half everyone encounter really give single, solitary shit health safety half. data. Facts. Hard science. Therefor, absolutely nothing accomplished amount reason. pure, horrifying willful ignorance. continue create huge amounts collateral damage. saddest thing is....many shielded consequences. don’t see woman breathed refusing wear mask waiting ICU lung transplant. real fucking irony is....if asshole worn mask first place, huge portion people wouldn’t dying alone isolation. It’s unreal many us oblivious law cause effect. They're getting immunity without vaccine. would think second wave would dispel myth already. add these:   
* retirement (nursing) homes remain open public.   
* universties closed.   
* can't travel local region european flights still open flu never end either. do? Yeah that's thinking too. huge surge young Americans becoming infected back summer made clear right wing nut jobs stupid. google economic recessions suicides. They're deadly things. universities closed curfew? sure? point, hope comment come across callous troubles faced pandemic. 

I mean surreal like times kid tornado warning, combination fear adrenaline makes time kind feel meaningless.  That's said real world.

For mask effective, use socializing. Nobody wearing mask friend. know people don’t die immediately contracting virus right? obvious truth person capable analyzing situation.

From every point view.

The first scientific point view: virus spread better closed spaces people stay hours everyday. Like schools.
The second monitoring/containment point view: given students young likely asymptomatic makes harder, impossible perform proper contact tracing.
The third personal responsibility point view: choose go bar, choose nice dinner restaurant. student cannot choose show school.
The fourth point view requires physical presence: lessons done remotely, mechanic cannot repair car online. pandemic logical perform remotely many things possible.
The fifth mental health point view: force students physically present risking get infected maybe kill dad grandma sound like something helps. unless idiot, forced share room people know might get covid know chance might infect beloved ones. seem ok incomprehensible me.
The sixth economical point view: even closing bars restaurants effect closing schools, impact economy much worse. clear losing job, money pay rent mortgage going help raise take care kid, even create environment kids safe happy.
The seventh point view making mistake. things said close bars turns wrong decision schools much bigger risk, outcome would locking bars also schools. outcome even reversed (first schools bars) extra economical damage take first route. even pretend first six points exist cost mistake resulting closing schools first lower cost closing bars first.

There way keeping schools open reasonable. idea. I’ll also say takes cooperation people large (something America doesn’t have) government needs prepared. I’m Melbourne ended lockdown essentially cases anymore. government implemented state emergency state disaster could essentially prevent worked extremely well. Lockdowns definitely work Currently 3 tiers England lockdown come force different levels spread.

There’s 5 tiers Scotland.

Wales said screw went full lockdown everyone, except sell farm animals it’s fine.

Northern Ireland completely lockdown everything including schools. clear answer apparently okay since EU borders opened. check airline sure. Well maybe taken preventive measures, they'd helped stop spread lockdown number two would needed.

I really understand want lockdown, stuff makes lockdown happen. German citizenship!  Well us dying would considered end, looks like we’re right track! recently lost loved one dementia absolutely horrible. got really emotional reading this. 

I'm so, sorry happened loved one. deserved better. hope mother peace, hope find peace. Take care yourself. literally eaten like 10 years life, every meal, including coffee.  pandemic hit stopped (even takeout). lost 47 lbs eat lot macaroni now.  W H Y?

I WANT JOB BACK

Put fucking mask on, socially distance, wash hands, dont attend large gatherings. SOoO hard America??????????  went really hard surprise people, ""worse pessimistic expectation"" take consideration infections spread eldery popularity screwed. 

Why? would actually solve lot problems. Hopefully future generation ones like Italy would know? currently data actually help us really estimate total deaths extreme scenarios.

For probable scenarios, estimate IFR somewhere 0,0001% 3-5%. Could little less, little more. CFR probably somewhere 0,5% maybe 10-12% (also depending much testing is). Thats already quite wide corridor. 
But really everything goes drain, gets really hard predict. circumstances vastly different many assumptions probable scenarios valid anymore. 40M 25% IFR 50% Americans infected. Yes, easy way.

We could accept like Sweden, hospitals busy period population builds immunity perhaps 3 months.

I still fail see acceptable hospitals overrun flu patients covid patients. Cheers man. Yeah it’s easy look everyone else wrong sitting back white collar quarantine, real people losing entire life’s work pandemic. breaks heart see small business small business city shuttering lost customers, pure simple. I’m way advocating bars packing people shoulder shoulder, plenty abiding local laws still suffering immensely. lost jobs, lost livelihoods. government failed them. can't make shit up. Hurr durr care people I'm smart cool definitely brainwashed direction completely touch Canadian discussing America Real bond yields Treasuries negative since mid yes, forward bond yields lose inflation. almost like easily verify information...

If little inflation bonds pay 0, cash safer bonds yields same. days bonds safe hedges equities over. future course. next years, taxes go up, services go down, public education, healthcare, unemployment &amp; disability paychecks go shit good apparently. Kids need go school parents work, yes gouv trying save economy half faced lockdown. Regardless fatality rate, known virus easily overwhelm hospitals (in comparison, even bad flu season capability strain hospital resources). hospitals verge capacity, would still think restrictions unjustified?

Additionally, wearing mask (which ""mandate"" discussed here), claim ""authoritarian measure"", one single easiest ways mitigate spread protect economy, expense minimal amount personal comfort. conditions economy remain open wear mask duration pandemic, would it? That’s actually right asf people spend money international tourists. disney laid many people. numbers glow pent domestic demand florida seeing dies top that. dealing keeping numbers low policies place people actually put effort it. talking imprisoning people. talking statewide mask mandates proactive measures limitations going keep exponential growth virus check.

It wrong mentality claim florida's numbers went peak must good job dealing virus waves exponential growth. That’s short term thinking.

Wear mask, distance, wash hands we’ll get back something approaches normal far sooner. Also, even asymptomatic cases long term damage. surprising. posted months, first Fall season virus tracked flu season nearly perfectly.  gardens great November house certainly better apartment. Slow clap. Well played. “Why keep asking stupid questions?”

-Fauci Chances age group won’t even get cold infected. perspective, care? Yeah nyc part. Still kinda ongoing Apart wanting over, actual reason people cited figures poor math comprehention skills. People commonly confuse absolute &amp; relative numbers, forget time dimension, reason conspiracy theories spread easily. completely made sources credibility even worst case scenarios match predictions. 
And *certainly* single scientific model. 

Your fantasist internet enjoys thinking essentially work disaster fiction. people I've encountered can't face problem what's typically referred cowards. 

The Dakotas filled cowards. Welp, given specifically American-related article.... think estimate know now.
But need start lockdown.
Then manage unlock.
And France might right. US. forced give fuck even we’re forced don’t it. It’s population’s DNA lookout number one. Even though things Sweden *not good*, weren’t *catastrophic* either, Swedes still heeded advice recommendations love neighbor. mostly stayed home despite lockdown. shit ain’t ever happening here. don’t care. won’t even stay home locked down. Things keep mind:

80-90% Spanish Flu victims died secondary bacterial pneumonia attacking weakened immune systems lungs damaged virus. antibiotics 1918, ventilators, ICU's. Baaaa 🐑 said WHO, use lockdowns preventative measure prevent healthcare system overloaded. Beyond methods spread prevention. yes, lockdowns “don’t work” interesting thing Europe really greatly lower cases summer compared US. problem never implemented preventive measures like Asian countries people pretended virus wont come back. wearing masks universally watching closely new local outbreaks infections. Shutdowns fucking horrible many ways economically psychologically prevented. There's going vaccine coming years, politicians aswell, hence keep moving goalposts. win popularity contests idea Veteran's, Labor, Memorial day actually are. Public schools around long time cognitive development came forms socialisation outside family. forms substituted school- closing schools bad avoided cost. *Pale flushed* keeping coronavirus numbers thing matters right certainly didn’t “win” war way owned....

You didnt get owned lost without gaining anything. let natural selection job? sure ""you people"" belong (a normal person?), even according source, says 42% rich people 36% middle lower income. barely supporting point. Basically #, intents purposes jive I'm seeing IRL - middle class lower income people want get life. think 6% amazing difference, also saying rich want open source says 58% want that.

Of course these, questions probably specific misleading. probably ask ""do want stuff open?"" probably variation ""do want things open covid rising rapidly area."" go every single time survey. Yes. I’ve waiting plan since April. I’m looking forward fallout unemployment runs out.

Also, plan point able work less 100% compliance we’ve shown that’s impossible. Hopefully soon.. lockdown reduce cases, let come back later though?

That exactly going happen Australia. Give months there’ll another severe outbreak.

It’s “worked” countries temporarily, it’s globally endemic virus now. It’s going get eventually. read measles antibodies go like 80-90% six months vaccination. mean immune measles afterward long time, though.

As per usual, sub read something bad, realized bad news coronavirus makes US look bad makes Trump look bad, upvote whatever pessimistic thing is. Oh, dunno, everyone else chronic diseases do? 

Let's honest: marijuana rich intended. Meanwhile, people intended likely end ICU rich CU-Boulder assholes want recreational weed. Huh. irony. think entirely correct. main purpose lockdown acclimate people disease prevention measures, build resources like hospital capacity, testing capacity, contact tracing get overwhelmed deluge cases. people wearing masks social distancing lockdown lifts, that's definitely bad, orthogonal issue. 
 
Related that: really think holding officials feet fire bit comes testing contact tracing. told costly lockdowns spring needed build things. are, six months later still takes days get test result back multiple days contacts identified told quarantine. 
 
This supposed *core* strategy. Yet nobody seems care we're still terrible job. officials, people, nobody. ctrl-F ""contact tracing"" COVID thread reddit lucky get single hit. 

I'm speaking American here, think applies EU well. Asia though, they're great. sounds like lot parents actually want take time deal angry kids explain can't go trick treating year. Good parents could still buy candy make treats dress home make holiday enjoyable kids want go effort. Hmmm wonder correlation? Houston. People definitely stay home though. walked around Target everyday claiming running errands.  Bars: Spread virus.

Also bars: OMG virus come from? this? OMG trouble! retarded? never argued distancing masks. argue broad lockdowns. 

😂😂 Fucking hilarious you’re giddy think got “gotcha” moment. 

Wear masks, recommend 6ft distancing, open everything restrictions. That’s position it’s never changed. think money related. patent means every item produced, patent owner receives money research.. think likely problem chosing produces it. manufacturing process done wrong, could serious implications people's health- name Pfizer, want brand related type issues. know.. seems plausible.. I’m puzzled people US keep demanding open economy back up. It’s open! Nothing closed except things business owners closed free will, care themselves, employees customers. won't. people say nothing like actually do.

The vaccine come out, millions people say, ""It's soon, get shot"". they'll find CAN'T get shot, medical personnel old people get it. they'll watch news months see infection rate death rate drastically dropping amongst medical workers old people.

Then vaccine finally available general public, sort lottery system far back line. wait months, millions people get vaccine become immune.

When turn finally comes up, they'll get ass get shot immediately. hate sub. Headlines meant give people heart attacks need vote loser office. Get vote. lot people living tents used average lay people, weren't. 

1) leader refused commit peaceful transfer power profiting office entirety term;

2) political party rammed Supreme Court Justice refused commit recusing cases involving election already happening nominated (involving guy nominated her); 

3) executive trying throw tens millions healthcare overturning SCOTUS middle pandemic record highs getting worse rest world much better job containing it. Americans 5x likely die COVID rest world. 

Which part *not* indicative shithole country?

Edit: made readable apparently 7 lines text long anyone read Death counts delay month, that's long takes average people die get infected. first wave deaths peaked mid April, month lockdown began.

So deaths seeing today result end September, 2nd wave started going 2.500 cases per day. Ha think us Americans use medical services! can’t afford that! 7 months long people go without seeing friends.  Every month, COVID risk feels less less scary v. mental health declines come isolation. England *

Wales lockdoen, Scotland less using English system, NI lockdown. Australia even ban travel within country Borders opened. 

I saw news saying borders 'would open returning French citizens', suggesting others allowed in. travel regions inside france also banned.

They done month ago. looks like Christmas cancelled french. Yeah I'd love see data Seattle / Washington State.

There's municipalities their.... shit.... together, rest nation sharing data public. want big powerful government mandates strong language, never mind social implications are. ""We, government, trust people graciously let us charge, we're gonna force inside good""

If people wanna what's required let them, pandemic people concerned practice need order safer. one people safer most, girlfriend *may* slightly risk zone due weird immune system.

I'm happy go extra mile *I* need to, think bad precedence set let government *mandate it* unless situation proper dire. scale 1 10, 10 dire, I'd rate 5.5. Climate change probably 12, comparisons sake. clearly calling notion close sarcastic premise, vaccine coming... Thanks kind words. imagine white house gone ahead plan send masks every house. nice note trump saying “nobody cares Americans djt. That’s assembled smartest people planet stop virus. Eggheads say masks work let’s give shot. “

Now alternative universe mind. Peace! Oh, people speed France since there's fines? Theaters restaurants everyday life lol Lack


Lack social responsibility think schools safe?  American lockdown? lockdown? must missed it. antibodies immune response body Yeah. Nobody expects live times. keep keeping on. 3rd times charm... It’s highly contagious. was, 1% countries populations would infected. 

It generally doesn’t make people sick work. friends entire family none kids felt 1 parent mild cold symptoms. Don’t speak absolutes. Yeah dont disagree states big cities like Chicago really major restrictions. I'm saying still technically lockdown sense one France ftr think fly people time around. going MASSIVE protests watch. LOL, look europe right now. Waaay worse USA. Yeah want keep lockdown, need good follow up.

But pretty much everywhere, drop ball soon lockdown lol. 

Kinda like basement flooded, get water bother finding water got closing hole. remember recently talking redditor infected refuses social distance wear mask. basically admits thay doesnt care people must make sacrifices convenience.

Thats type thought process people I'm doctor, I'd go get checked out. can't find anything says bradycardia (abnormally slow heart rate) sign Covid getting worse, though find articles talking bradycardia covid patients. concern simply evidence might affecting heart way. maybe perhaps 

Allow introduce : ""mayhaps"" That's true. certainly put upper bounds things. tens millions confirmed infections, reinfection common, we'd know. known uncommon. extent uncommon, however, less clear. economic recession caused kill far people. Made laugh. Thank you. Live Victoria, Melbourne. think mask wearing 99.9%. hardly see person without mask leave house Except wont 2020 over. I'd surprised gone handled summer fall 21 Definitely call doctor. athletic? resting HR easily 48 workout days. live NJ. much rare find nice person haha. Come visit Trenton see feel. No, pay me. I'll bring first wall down. think would even need mandate... Trump's sycophants would fall line endorsed it, even disheartening, IMO. Wait, US done this? Like, all? What? president turned rules suggestions race/political issue. Czechia, deemed system similar Korea's EISS, pulls credit card smartphone data legally operated here. That's issue human rights. laws, case local european. I’m baffled people making regular holiday plans. I’ve lived least 600 miles family entire adult life. enjoy going home holidays years I’ve made every year. promise you, skip year going home holidays. People time. literally can't get fuck failed state. spend twice much health care generally worse coverage. rampant homelessness, country millions empty houses even empty space. generate enormous food surplus children starving.

You got one thing right though. care. fuck! simply possible. sun cannot give sunburn jeans, perhaps leg got hot get sunburnt point. true sun absolutely joke Australia. corporation people One 150 worked on, likely one 9 vaccine candidates already Phase 3 testing. believe they're called Republicans seems like hasty decision, lot could change April take stab rationalizing - keep business open homeless. Done. People need money said business provides order food, shelter inconvenient things. That's lot positive tests, especially since there's already got 'testing fatigue' months. also covering ears screaming Hair Fuhrer said we're rounding bend?! Bigger things worry about. point saving every life means fucked decades economic fallout. Americans made choice, don’t let cure become worse disease. sure people resisting. I’m really sure I’m responding wanted info could clearly look VC million deaths, plus close 2 million civilians deaths. US suffered 58,000 deaths. truly think masks much. BUT

A. masks certainly SOMETHING. they're useless
B. serve important social signal need remain vigilant business usual
C. jurisdiction refuses issue even simple order like masks unlikely anything else curtail spread like limiting attendance assuring compliance regulations. 

A mask simple measure marginally effective piece overall strategy need EVERYTHING mitigate spread. 

Tl;dr shits fucked man.  possibility. research needed. sit watch horror complete disbelief. country claims leader free world powerful nation allow happen? unfathomable me. mean, Dems literally can't anything anymore national scale, local officials state officials anything, thing close businesses. Unfortunately still kids comorbidities high risk serious covid. kid one them. testing very-low-risk kids potentially save children hospitalization serious complications death. Sorry say it, people south general stupid. 

They think ""Jesus save them"". lockdowns eradicate virus must limit travel. See NZ Atlantic Canada restrictions bottom tell personal liberties taken away exercise considered essential? people family bubble talking about?  rest already socially isolated probably.

Here's thing: live alone work home. However, used love going bars, shows, dancing....all shit's shut down. Rightfully so. I'm running fight Dad, stay bars, stay church. 

But horrendous single people, too. fear we're right behind them.  Mask use down, cases up. I'm still hearing ""I dont know anyone it.""  count presidential tweets media Let’s hope don’t. It’ll kill far people it’ll save. can't ignore lockdown France. mandatory enforced fines.

When mandatory fines, French people become good citizens :)

The 1st lockdown well respect right like 95% people wear mask cities mandatory. rational logical approach. bad ain’t happening (US). fucking hope try stay realistic. Politicians bunch lying rats. why? think vaccine time soon? Well, that's one way look bright side cluster fuck Trump Administration. Here's hoping! beg differ...the Pandemic game ends disease infects kills everyone...we good start.  avoid lockdown health care system jeopardy collapsing that’s see massive deaths 
 
So guess question is: France could? so, tragic. didn't, well, represents massive failure governance considering stuck last resort *again*. entire text linked article read ""Because they're stupid."" article's title lie, stopped lockdown fanatics trying use though.

The truth Sweden's COVID death rate flatlined several months now. country actually made this.  ### Making eating safer

Despite dire outlook, ways reopen restaurants minimizing risk infection “Any time people indoors risk,” says William Bahnfleth, professor architectural engineering Pennsylvania State University. many dangers mitigated. crucial thing remember one measure enough own; increasing safety layering many different efforts top one another possible.

First foremost, people eat outdoors whenever possible. “The risk infection 20 times higher inside outside,” says Bjorn Birnir, director UC Santa Barbara’s Center Complex Nonlinear Science. However, restaurants either can’t get approval outdoor seating local authorities don’t money outdoor furniture patio heaters help make diners comfortable [winter rapidly Northern Hemisphere. 

If outdoor seating isn’t possible, eateries focus simpler stuff. Servers need wear masks, customers they’re table. Although masks won’t prevent *all* aerosols getting through, stop some. Tables far away possible. Again, isn’t perfect solution—but farther away groups customers, less likely inhale big concentration breath. Use measures you’d take try avoid secondhand smoke analogy, says Jimenez. 

Some adaptations inventive. example, restaurants turn music discourage customers talking loudly, says Sam Harrison, owns brasserie called Sam’s Riverside London. although might feel unnatural, it’s good idea diners sit diagonally anyone isn’t household. [Simulations generated supercomputer Fugaku](http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13817552) Japan found 75% fewer droplets reach way sit opposite someone. 

It’s difficult judge safe restaurant looking it. can’t tell glance many air changes per hour taking place. Bahnfleth, architectural engineer, says want aim six full replacements indoor air volume per hour—perhaps achievable something simple opening window door. It’s tricky measure air change rate without hiring expensive air quality consultants, one shortcut could use carbon dioxide monitor (you buy $150) proxy. levels stay [below 800-950 parts per ventilation probably sufficient. 

### Keeping score

Restaurateurs want get idea well they’re addressing risk use one free online risk estimators places like engineering firm, experts [Oregon [University Colorado, models let input details space—size, ceiling height, average occupancy, on—and produce score tells roughly safe is. risk scores based modeling relative aerosol risk, require good basic grasp numeracy science, useful tool. “These best things have, they’re still based fairly uncertain degree knowledge much virus infected person sheds, much need inhale get infected,” Bahnfleth says. Although they’re based peer-reviewed science, taken guides rather immutable truths, rely many unknowns (they can’t know, example, people wearing masks correctly).

If open doors aren’t option, air purifiers dispose 99% aerosols air stream passes them. restaurants may already installed part overall heating, ventilation, air conditioning system. don’t, standalone purifiers cost $100 apiece placed around dining area. 

Finally, there’s category interventions might marginally useful verge pandemic theater. Temperature checks widespread highly visible, help weed people symptoms—but nothing prevent asymptomatic people entering premises. Dividers tables, meanwhile, could stop people sneezing coughing other, useless stop aerosol transmission. 

The sad truth long high levels virus circulating community, people going justifiably nervous eating out. That’s something restaurant owners can’t control. adapt—more takeout meals, outdoor seating—and try survive. Harrison, owner Sam’s Riverside, doesn’t see return pre-pandemic levels profit foreseeable future. “It won’t kill us, it’ll get pretty damn close,” says. simple folk lambs. &amp;#x200B;

It’s cruel irony things make restaurant appealing precisely currently make dangerous—the intimacy, coziness, groups people deep conversation, whiling away hours drinks meal. Eating restaurant [one riskiest coronavirus pandemic. 

To understand why, need think latest science around covid-19 passes person person. [official World Health Organization start pandemic coronavirus mostly spread droplets generate talk, sneeze, cough. However, [the evidence mounting months aerosols—which smaller droplets hang air like smoke—are significant route infections, main one. would explain virtually every recorded coronavirus outbreak occurred indoors.

Sadly, advice public [still caught US Centers Disease Control Prevention started acknowledge possibility airborne transmission, many countries don’t mention official guidance. result, many restaurants still stuck following advice simply isn’t reflective latest science—obsessing cleaning, wearing visors ([which don’t protect aerosols), setting plastic dividers tables. measures might marginally useful, mostly amount “pandemic theater”—interventions provide *appearance* safety, little way real protection. 

* look restaurant 
\- Size matters. bigger restaurant = one space easily. 
\- looks small, busy, loud, windows fogging up—definitely avoid. Also avoid restaurants servers aren’t wearing masks.  
\- there’s option sit outside, take it. 
\- Failing that, sit close open door window possible.  
\- you’re meeting people outside household, sit diagonally them.  
\- Make sure group stays far away diners possible.

Why, exactly, restaurants risky? First off, tend noisy spaces. People talk loudly, expelling air usual—and thus potentially virus-laden aerosols. Researchers yet work precisely much virus breathe in, long exposed someone shedding viral particles, get infected. CDC estimates it’s possible get infected 15 minutes close proximity, reported cases infections restaurants “all involve infected susceptible person sharing air significant amount time, often 30 minutes hours,” says Jose-Luis Jimenez, chemistry professor University Colorado, Boulder, studied aerosols two decades. It’s also possible, theoretically, catch covid-19 aerosols left behind infected person already left room—but aren’t confirmed cases occurring, according Jimenez. virus loses infectivity time, “typically one two hours,” says.

Then there’s lack mask-wearing inside restaurants. Diners tend take off, can’t eat drink wearing one. may heard [ventilation pretty well—another area restaurants typically score poorly. Inadequate ventilation allows tiny virus particles hang air long periods time, waiting breathed in.

And course, restaurant successful, needs popular enough attract people around neighborhood, city, even afield come dine roof. It’s hard imagine inviting setting airborne pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 spread (other perhaps [cruise It’s little wonder, then, restaurants shown perfect breeding ground events, one person passes virus dozens others. Virtually every [documented case taken place noisy, poorly ventilated room—many restaurants. 

At start October, Public Health England [found people who’ve tested positive coronavirus last two months, “eating commonly reported activity two seven days prior symptom onset.” Scotland’s government consistently [found quarter people returning positive tests covid-19 restaurant, pub, cafe week before. September, CDC 802 adults US found people tested positive covid-19 approximately twice likely reported dining restaurant tested negative. 

“Without doubt, there’s association there,” says Nathan Shapiro, professor emergency medicine Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, one authors CDC study. 

With growing case dining out, it’s wonder pandemic devastated restaurant business. big-name chain restaurants drive-through takeout options [have [tens dine-in restaurants forced close, potentially taking [millions people’s them.

### saying everyone free lock house running essentials, etc. feel uncomfortable. flatten curve long? lockdown like summer, people partying going vacation normal.

We need lockdown, slow return back normal. Slowly introduce society norms, instead opening everything inve again. confused maybe mixing word used lady reporting ICU statistics.. I'll look videos, likely right. workplace opened indoor seating right cases nationwide surging county cases rising. :D corrected number 2.2 million close original projection nothing done covid. think back March worst case scenario projected 2-3 million. juxtaposition death toll Spanish flue disheartening. Gotcha, hyperbolic statement since obviously account portion population potentially immune, plus make sort assumption transmission etc.

But primarily drives IFR everyone infected, magnitude lower (infections versus population also magnitude lower). 100% infections, IFR simply CFR whole sample instead representative one. Belgium high density terrible urban planning. public transport crowded efficient. 

Combine several local governments federal government less month. temporary federal government didnt want take drastic measurements focused forming government.

Combine large group covid downplayers ( one popular party Belgium said install covid app trust government.)

Also experience living 26 years Belgium masters bending rules. group( large ) broke rules.

Belgium also transit country get lot covid beginning. even every single person us covid access treatment, still wouldn’t reach 40 million. Agreed. get annoyed flippant people ""shutting everything down"" fix everything.  think comes place privilege, economic societal. devastating last resort. Sometimes wonder people pushing every turn, criticizing attempt civilization adapt move forward best bots designed create unrest keep lower classes desperate. know registered account is?

edit: less snark, country registered account would RRSP, TFSA, things called different things essentially those. Almost every country them, US similar things different names.

So 80% assets held TFSAs / RRSPs country countries similar, held boomers. Registered accounts GENERALLY maxed first, proportion understates boomer advantage since they're primarily ones maxing accounts. basically think end world. Pathetic, grow up. Praying guys thing stops bad guy virus, good guy gun. earned revenue supporting tax base?

Edit: subreddit always downvotes tough question. really annoying mean back poor people averaged something like 50 iq lack education nutrition, like hellholes Africa still do? Yeah, mutilating. young need vaccines too. It’s contagious. I’m sorry you’re dumb see that. whole family got live house idiot. Pretty simple. family get knew? still family 100s know got it? understand coronavirus numbers thing matters? situation one dimensional. Mental health also really important measures save lives cause suffering whole generation kids way fragile us adults. don’t know closing schools better option around long time health neither I, don’t argue like it’s obvious truth. I’m tired people thinking know better experts spending 10+ years exact subject personally consider simple death rate. long term effects much worse suffering compared flu also factors decision. Although speculation long term effects cant really know yet... governments would take care people instead imposing ‘new normal’ restrictions, actually shut countries bit, we’d past this. much US tied making money giving handouts, people less screwed matter happens. responded person you, I’ll respond you, too.

Teens need peer-to-peer interaction part gaining independence parents. Even COVID, teens generation experience depression anxiety teens past years, many psychologists believe partly due screen times replacing in-person interaction. ""Rawr! dare try protect vulnerable citizens save lives!""

Edit: Also, since thread fairly high moment, article prevent hospitals overwhelmed. exactly lockdowns used sometimes. Except wasn’t. far fewer people died.  saw bullshit well. hell selling idea to? Like adding large empty book accomplishments supposed impress? supporters stupid still dropping dead virus simultaneously believe glorious leader trump eradicated it? Oh, goodie. guess poor like cant afford college stuck hell. start revolution cant come soon enough. Anyone want run odds 10+ healthy people 30-50 go ventilators? odds must astronomical. incorrect. 

To confirm reinfection, need two things:

1) genetically sequence strain;

2) showing infection different strain (to rule remnants first infection). 

The amount people strain sequenced, twice, small. ""tens millions"", rather very, tiny fraction that. 

And even then, reinfections strain can't even count reinfections.

And even then, issues undercounting cases (not enough tests early days, asymptomatic people getting tested, etc). 

In words, MASSIVELY undercounting reinfections. that's now, even long since first big outbreaks even shorter time many confirmed cases (from later waves). Yes. Forget antibody counts, cells, every immune mechanism, look Coronaviruses behave infect humans. stores wrecked LOL  vaccine though distribution given high risk people..so could go back normal? Fight what? Containment virus? Imagine wasting much time writing out. guess it’s fine you’re jobless parents’ basement. Yeah, people little world. reality. historic three year run year companies buying back stock due low interest rates.  real growth value handed investors companies taking loans. fuck senior citizens right? 'Murica! Mah freedoms! freedom wear mask? Man memes really true...... see Bolivia one now, thanks naming one. I'm curious Latin American states well, could list chance? best, ever make restaurants like 5% safer.  need temporarily give idea eating inside restaurant foreseeable future. state, governor said contact tracing showing home/family gatherings top spreader

Even fully lockdown, people still gonna go work essential jobs still take public transportation. it’s nonessential businesses fueling surge shutting isn’t going help. realistically shut people insisting thanksgiving that’s going help, can’t. won’t it. 

[NYTimes: scientists say schoolchildren unlikely fuel data see, comfortable children not, fact, driving transmission, especially school settings,” said Brooke Nichols, infectious disease modeler Boston University School Public Health. Vaccine won’t soon enough holidays. next announcements preliminary phase 3 data candidates start coming end November December. looking approvals distribution means earliest vaccine available probably February March Right, commenter say lol  feel pretty good. worst yesterday couldn’t really leave bed, night sleep I’m ok Yeah, [it worked Compared European nations clear leadership outset, US performance bad, orders magnitude worse ""good"" places like Canada, Belgium, Switzerland, etc. runs counter standard narrative, Americans done decently well despite executive branch actively trying kill people make local Democratic leadership look bad. “fight” virus staying home petulant asshole worst case scenario really everything breaks down.

It's like fire city. One two burning houses problem, firemen probable able save nearly everyone. soon soon houses fire fire dept handle deaths change survival decreases lot.

But again. That's absolute worst scenario unlikely happen. Lol read comments section anything you’ll see isn’t going done. Half country thinks BS hoax, one going able stop thanksgiving. It’s over.

The people comply already gathering. one going house parties right going stop governor tells to, sorry. Mass testing, contact tracing, universal mask wearing social distancing. That's prevent 3rd wave could've prevented 2nd one.

Economy need reopen cases low. Lockdowns viable long term solution.  fucking save lmmmmmao 5% hospital utilization due COVID flattening curve? 3%? 1%?
I get it. DeSantis bad. Florida Dumb. Objectively look numbers tell FL needs better realizing can't imprison 21M people stop moving around. remind everyone FL 26,000 less deaths Also service economy mean tourists going come.

Tourists coming. Air BNB's South FL neighborhood full New Yorkers. Property inventory &lt;1%. 1,000 new people moving FL day.  change? guys opened schools late August 7 day average rose 1000% locked down. position makes sense likely stem data. Big E go Hollywood.  Nah Economy fine.

Don Depends. I've basically since late March Boston. exceptions numbers got really sexy: got new tires, beers patio Cambridge etc. Otherwise Work Grocery store occasional walk park. *This certainly doable*. They'll recover lack education way quicker they'll recover death lifelong impairments. German disease law says constitutional rights may restricted, without cause. there's huge debate Internet ""cause"" is.

But law explicitly calls personal liberty, freedom movement, freedom assembly, sanctity home constitutional rights may restricted. Trust me, fair share anti-maskers coviodiots Germany.

Yes countries let us in? associate's degree network adminstration think countries hurting skill set Yes, know that. arguing people care less time round. Convenience Ontario population 14.5 million.... 800 cases day. Less 350 hospital less 80 ICU. wear masks home..... well 99.9% us. sayin'. Spin numbers however see fit enjoy bars. Yes lol. We’ll one widely available next spring/summer. Stop conspiracy theories. point everybody knows somebody who's died hospital Covid,

That's one metric keep calculating myself,

In US, 1 37 people tested positive.

So go somewhere 37 people standing around, basically guaranteed, someone infected point, infected moment. is, run within radius like 1-2 km home. Fight exactly? 

It got bad, proved couldn’t personal responsibility implemented feel one. don’t even know I’m reading thread. It’s interesting...I kindof getting “used to” whole new normal thing, anxiety dread depression coming back. :(. Anyway internet friend...hang there. Mask stay safe &lt;3 we’re going make side this. It’s going stay way forever. going outside run okay.. Nah, stops people realise no-lockdown solution Sweden followed solution. capacity implement lockdowns limited. yet people still keep ignoring like already killed 1,000x people 9/11 US. Stalin said? one death tragedy, one million statistic? course have, although there’s bit hold partially Conservatives despise spending money partially politicians want political advantage Last time allowed go 1 hour 1km radius around home. time know.

Republicans wanted, ""it's OK people die order protect economy"". point numbers high enough pretty much becomes single wave burns country? numbers sound unrecoverable without major intervention going happen. virus cause strokes heart attacks young healthy people, even weren’t sick it. childish perception liberty means

And argue faulty perception is, proof never-ending battle personal liberty. 

Someone recently chided wearing mask, tell marginally protect protect others; respectful wear precaution someone's health.  argued it. simply offered would happen got ICU ventilator die? chilling response was.....that's personal decision business deal with. No, he's saying cases continue go current rate they're going up... fast, healthcare system crumbles, tons Dr's Nurses everywhere breakdown quit kiss economy goodbye LONG time tons things become even deadlier functional healthcare system.

If cases stay 500k/week, take 10 years so. knows immunity last 5+ years well. Sure, convince nothing would different we'd competent national PPE supply scheme, unified messaging masks, someone half-ass negotiations stimulus let party walk, someone literally single [largest source Coronavirus misinformation Yup. I’m west coast it’s light winters restaurants already folding left right. Small businesses place never even reopened. 

Fauci keep preaching wants. Americans won’t give shit kids go hungry. It’s mainly meant idiots pushing envelope crowding bars clubs stupid gatherings. That's really sad reality. dad getting increasingly pissed go eat him. He's virus denier, he's definitely ""just wear mask wash hands, fine!"" type person. may true, even take risk? I'm going risk contracting COVID, going eat local restaurant. High school, uni hope, number deaths would low.

But 40 million, improbable, totally unrealistic.

The death rate rise exponentially healthcare system completely overwhelmed. example, virus loads received could increase lot due sheer number infected people. would increase number severe cases.

Plus, huge portion Americans obese (115M+) overweight (another 100M+). 10% Americans diabetes, 33M. Americans older 65. Basically, way half US population could face severe symptoms due one factors.

~~At moment, Covid-19 already surpassed number deaths (adjusted population) caused Spanish Flu US.~~

Edit: I've mixed numbers, sorry:

Spanish Flu: 675k dead, 105M pop 
Covid-19: 227k dead, 328M pop

So Spanish Flu would roughly 2.2M deaths today. one house since February. dine restaurant timeframe, indoors establishment. I'm worried people like think going bar another peak okay.. *Thank you* realistic! Good job avoiding trap many people fallen into, quickly, believing unrealistic dates.

This *not* going end 2020. Heck, *not* going end Spring 2021, either! Dr. Robert Redfield, director CDC, stated vaccines virus reach ordinary populace second half 2021, even *that's* optimistic estimate. many venues, Broadway New York Philharmonic, forgoing 2020-21 lineups altogether. many events, BlizzCon, cancelled again. 

""Don't worry, we'll even bigger event next year!"" stupid promise many propagators conventions. pandemic unlikely end within one year start. everyone shut ears longer - *but realistic* - predictions, guess we're little cheery Pollyannas want done Easter/summer/Election Day/the end 2020/*next* Easter. Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health stated would truly safe return normal *the third quarter 2022*. beginning thought little apocalyptic, even I'm guilty myself, whereas even think ""old"" lives back *that point*. 

Most people rejected message. hated T.H. Chan School Public Health told truth.

For know, things may never even look like pandemic ever again. know lots people might currently stuck ""denial"" phase, point another, reality eventually slam faces like brick wall. Check back two hours. little surprised learn well. shouldn’t though given won’t even let visit DUI record. need lockdown Macron can't legally anyway (as stricter Wuhan levels). one's lasting year lol news, Trump giddy delight handling pandemic. round golf (using 30-mph golf cart) $3 waters everyone order.  Well vaccine play, I'm gonna care. Problem right actions anti-maskers affect maskers there's vaccine. there's vaccine, care anti-maskers do, we'll least protection via vaccination.  Highschools lower. Yea, America. ""It is"" Except even within covid parameters Bidens rallies small. would small without covid theres zero enthusiasm him. hes holding mostly states hes supposedly in. polls right would campaigning flip Texas, Arizona Geoegia *exclusively*. 

Sorry guys need learn critical thinking media. countries great either honestly. America actually viewed symbol science rationalism.

I hope many people leave otherwise America become exactly fear. late though, hope guys change current election. started feel way Bush/Gore election, internet social media grew, feeling intensified. reached breaking point 2016. wife too. know exactly would go, language skills almost non-existent valuable skills, much it. matter part US lived in, felt home two decades.

People seem think Biden wins, everything going sunshine rainbows. won't. going rain farts divisiveness nationalism grows. said, Trump symptom greater problem. Appoint judges get richer? pass stimulus package blame deficit democrats January 20th Guayacuil's outbreak also rainy season. Spread appears faster places unusually dry also places unusually wet. tropics warm cold seasons often still wet average seasons. state international tourists visit state?

Second yeah play videogames, videogames escapism books, movies, going walks outside, reddit, number things.

You're missing point though. reason mentioned conspiracy sub this:

You trying discussion arguments based fact reason. making arguments based ""principles"" emotion. 

The US gives citizens individual liberties almost country. That, however, mean free whatever want. also laws?

You seem someone thinks love truth is. Lockdowns mandatory masks stop spread disease. US better job tens thousands people would still alive today. ingrained ""personal choice good country"" mean rest us capitulate insanely misguided worldview. Yeah I'm curious COVID ""washing"" different portions US. NO, I'm saying herd immunity midwest done we're good, almost feels like NY got hit hard, south sunbelt, west, midwest. 

There's still cases NY, we're testing lot more, positivity rate staying 1.1-1.6% range. Cali well, things outdoors. Here’s old classic ”[Alternative (the song) guess seeing game. fun! truth 40% population. Thats 40% people voted. 

What exact numbers are, knows. seen polls showing support single payer (or expanded Medicare) though. needing basic human interaction.

Most people family bubble talking about?


The rest already socially isolated probably. Almost guaranteed.. elected Biden!! PROBLEMS SOLVEDD Schools mean high school lower university included? Yeah live sticks there's much adherence. Lucky us Walmart insists still. must rural city south? don’t see widespread basis?

I’m thinking 90% people angry covid handled could care less wear mask. It’s real consequences lockdowns arbitrary policies angry about. wooooo we're dead wooooooo There's alternate reality pandemic handled competently forty percent America super pissed president Hillary. Giving up?

I feel like neighbors never tried.

I’m sorry mess surrounds you. Religious belief political belief thing us politics. Cult mentality held Vietnam

Say what? got fucking owned Vietnam. I've noticing same. Pro-US propaganda grow with, younger definitely proud part America. I've gotten older, I've noticed two main things: I've seen ""America, fuck yeah!!"" propaganda, seen racism nowhere near close extinguished US (worldwide too, especially here). things engrained US culture mindset something really want part of. Hey America know ducking things us right?!? - Canada longer symbol inclusion opportunity

We never were. drank koolaid. Examples country rotting inside impact daily life? watch horrible things media youtube get riled it? Give break. Find one reputable source says IFR 1%.

I’m going assume 1% aka worst case. I’m also going assume 100% US gets infected, also bit far fetched, not. 

328,200,000 current US population*.01=3,280,000 dead. 

CA population 39,260,017

TX population 28,995,881

Sources: thus far suggested substantial under-ascertainment cases, estimates IFR converging approximately 0.5 - 1% people want happen? I’m genuinely asking. stay inside forever virus going go away. Growing immunity diseases part getting stronger. Always taken food, thanks recommendation. Appreciate it. Good near every metric markets overvalued. Markets going sideways year honestly best outcome hope for. need give companies time actually grow current valuations. theory it’s longer comfortable dine outside restaurant due colder weather, patrons increasingly choose eat indoors instead. course masks impossible eating, lots maskless people closed space, potentially infecting other. downvoted comment many threads? like pouring kerosene house, tossing blocks burning thermite it, shutting water neighborhood, locking fire department fire house wondering home burned down. I'm sad. lockdown going much harder last one. 
 
Edit : read title guys, nothing like American lockdown. people stay inside non stop except rare walk outside. Last weekend talking someone hospitalized COVID 3 weeks back April, currently again. Maybe I’m cynical, think whole crisis indictment American society. Democracy, freedom, individualism, etc. great times good, don’t work well times bad. Collectivism / coordination needed maneuver crises. Americans learned lesson apparently need again...the hard way. happening Illinois various counties banned indoor dining again.

""For reason numbers keep going can't figure why. Maybe virus mutated?"" Easter sure time lockdown Thanks suggestion. talked getting levels checked. Thank much. quite imagination. DUH worry, gone april People less likely impacted dangerous thing, less avoid said dangerous thing... always like say, Trump made problems known. shit still going Obama Bush, people started wake it. worry Biden wins, problems won’t talked anymore people say “vote like life depends it” go back easy daily lives forget everything many Trumps Merkel? public health measures us back normal much faster

What health measures think speed all? Even countries well control nowhere near ""normal."" two paths normalcy: Get effective vaccine, give up. middle ground, although understand may good someone's mental health think normalcy one national mask mandate away, much difficult that, possible all. Ah yes, ole American lockdown. I'm kinda worried people taking it.

The people already careful following guidelines take people problem right anyways.

The people problem, anti masters hoaxers refuse vaccine continue spread it. 99% people social distancing past like february guess. even day man TFW people find Canada stricter immigration laws US  ""freedum"" ends nose... Trump fat old man 70s dancing 4 days getting it. tell something know will. Everyone known diagnosed bounced back issue. Stop living fear. number 1 weapon us.

I'd bet whoever said bullish head strong never admit flawed logic instead double pass blame whoever can. Scratch liberal fascist bleeds I'm wondering stop wearing masks, want actually able conversation someone without speak super loudly. strictly political, targeted particular individual, pass 10K dead Canada?  Literally everything said beginning exactly fauchi said, especially masks. even get started call half assed negotiations forget first round went swimmingly. guess what, senate elected half republican. can't steam roll think know better. Germany interestingly hasn’t making new debt six years, compared others like France, yearly deficit around 80 billion pandemic. US even yearly deficit trillion dollars. whole world runs debt doesn’t even need problem. Especially Germany, considering rest world performing much worse. famous people, athletes, celebrities Covid, suffered long-term issues? know Thanksgiving Christmas US going produce bloodbath unlike anything US ever seen. already see people social media champing bit throw big holiday gatherings spite... IDK, virus? Wait... thought Trump administration defeated pandemic.

/s (sad even put here) Yes, know *exactly* he's gonna say.

He's gonna tell us even vaccine millions at-risk people, *still* going allow us return ""old normal"". According him, we're *still* going socially distance, wear masks, cancel large gatherings, close schools necessary. 

He'll urge governors United States avoid giving complacency, keep intense restrictions (including, limited to, lockdown) place. Many obey. ones pay price increased case death counts. Yes, even vaccine. vaccine alone enough!

Would obey him? changed?

While i'm HVAC tech infectious disease doctor seems simple enough me, homes buildings Europe air conditioning open window fan usually enough, winter windows shut, heat on, people staying home longer. 

Might also explain southern hot humid states air conditioning minimum requirement poorly summer upper midwest control despite lack mask mandates. Pretty damn depressing thing allowed go work go school. eyes ""national lockdown"" cover every base otherwise potential vain. crazy Texas surpassed California total cases. CA 10 million people twice population density. Plus CA country's highest homeless population. people intentionally spreading get higher infection rates CA. vaccine doesnt make immune, especially coronaviruses, make body handle easier handle something. virus never vanish. Itll get line others get year year out. Allowing schools businesses continue sounds like half measure allow spread continue. understand uproar people dying past years flu pneumonia ? numbers par ? Racist ignorant af  thing understand. Spring, Germany quick enact restrictions. Macron announced lockdown effect tomorrow night. can't fast (or least Friday night) Many Factories still running first lockdown. *cries falcons* Hey stupid fuck, listen eh? money be? Bonds @ 0.0001%? Curious see people live interest. California $21 billion surplus last year. How'd state do? even I'm sure France fighting virus make us look bad!

-the US, probably maybe they're Lions fan, think wanna socially distance games years lol I’m even republican stop character assassination right bat (Oh wait, it’s 2020, people can’t enter argument without discrediting validity opponent first, case wrong delegate stupid, racist, wrong, etc.) 

Not sure noticed, keeping business open doesn’t immediately give covid entire community. fact, less 1% likely actually contract virus! Losing 1% sales sounds better 100%. 

rndljfry Economics: Instead losing 3 weeks pay sales, let’s shut economy 8 months lose 8 months sales pay! realize we’re kicking road, we’ll lose additional 3 weeks pay sales get inevitably sick. 

I assume white collar industry, didn’t lose job twice due shutdowns? way lose pay you’re sick. like media stop pushing fear election. eradicate,

It's bad HK flu 68. made fine. Ok. delete like embarrassing comments others see it. get back rock. pseudo intellectual prick blood hands. Go try wash off. Lockdown 3/4 3 repeat society collapses rich politicians profit suffering.

To liberty means bill rights, importantly first, second, fourth, fifth, eight fourteenth amendments, attendant case law legal norms. 

From meta standpoint, liberty means due process. I.e., adverse govt action requires opportunity hearing disinterested tribunal. Well confirmed, lockdown december 1st Pay... &amp; right wing left well..as someone runs small business assure stupid people sides reasons wearing them. federal standards states make standards business dark money interests take states court standards overturned judges Mitch chuckles Wait til several people immediate family died nearly died, they'll wear mask. They're young, they're screwed - life! Covid - 'hoax' keeps giving! didn’t downvote you, still disagree. way use definition liberty we’re sideways. general, colloquial definition liberty misapplied national liberty case.

You may heard phrase “your right swing fist air ends top nose.” That’s I’m getting at: definitely inherent restraint act without harm others baked definition liberty freedom. 

People generally misinterpreting national freedom mean “I want, want, want” true causes harm others believe rights infringed upon asked wear mask. Sounds like plan. saved world. Cryptocurrency giant pump dump scheme since Great Crash 2018... expect time around.

EDIT: lol see trolling based conversations sub weeks ago Sweden's numbers. virus cannot spread

Yes perfect lockdown. everyone lives bubble independent air supply world completely shuts down. violations rules, essential services governments, power, fire, police. That’s possible. 

If globally coordinated effort “let’s stop human contact 2 weeks eliminate diseases” possible world would done long ago. 

**The entire point lockdown measures first place slow disease stop it.** go dole, use medical services get pulled over, right champ. happening ends political arena...many people sides either stupid needed care. blame much big store locations like Walmart enforcing entry without masks gives people reason use out. merely reduces length illness, probably worth it. 

However prevents illness progressing severe fatal well worth it. Also even one day hospital avoided well worth financially. wiped twice like you, saw people going machine machine without wiping gyms 'mask mandate' wasnt even followed staff.. really surprising gyms closed, annoying gym important physical mental health. season finale December *has* zombies.

I'm tired people acting like problem run rampant country far long fear offending slightly less horrible Christians (that far fewer number experience). extremism everywhere, remotely south. Things continue worsen unless start getting comfortable openly criticizing evangelical Christianity stranglehold country. fear point probably late. Trump access best medical care world. 200k people US alone died exactly, deep state hoax? Illuminati? Compared spring restrictions Bavaria, shops open also kitas/schools. Everything else Except past studies, later waves actually bigger first wave. example, go 15K/day 5K/day, instead would go 15K/day something like 25K/day.

Just look 1918 spanish flu second wave, prime example right there. People like brag wearing mesh masks? memory sucks - Said Trump 5 months ago. “Freak out” “national cohesive lock strategy contain virus.” US like putting two wheels car needs four. looks like half-strategy, fact strategy all. Wtf comment political? Stop silencing people close restaurants, packed. predict lockdown bring quite bit change. Work = public works construction. Non-essential businesses closing telework possible white collar jobs. Except know... nothing!

The fucked thing govt back logging processing lot tests. days, case numbers would 800s looks like stopped processing tests. lot people called this.

A lot people Ontario (myself included) think government intentionally made testing system way put barriers testing order create illusion numbers lower really are....because Christmas coming want lock want people going spend money.

But strategy kind backfired govt. govt next nothing, lot people put lockdowns. drove stores night...stores open parking lots empty. lot stores look like ghost town, road almost empty 7pm. one early christmas shopping year everyone lost faith government's integrity showing real amount transmission communities IFR 0.6 1.5% IIRC.

However... comorbidities already identified asymptomatic cases, worsening linearly symptoms to, well... death.

Basically even live, body forget. mean pieces shit, wrong. 

The pandemic over, endemic. able work months? really say covid cost _no_ freedom all?

I'll repeat said another comment. Saying went house arrest ridiculous saying lost freedoms all. EU: 375 fatalities per million, 12.4k cases per million

US: 701 fatalities per million, 26.9 cases per million

Say what?  Take basic precautions (masks, avoid big gatherings, washing hands, etc) keep manageable levels hang months vaccines rolled (in case virus hopefully go away).

Everything closed, literally everything, schools included.

Interstate flights banned, state borders closed, allowed go 5km home. express permission workplace justifying work can't done home face massive fines. Probably Democrats stronghold cities. states don’t want put millions people work without bail out, isn’t coming February earliest hella expensive though Multiple public people said today strong months come.

So months long lockdown coming. Starting friday monday...

People stupid can't follow rules. Like supermarkets cart mandatory, two days ago saw half people without one, worse nobody said damn thing them. Nah, hear Laura Ingraham? Biden's locking Santa down.  Yep we're pretty fucking dumb bunch. 

That's irony stupidity, far stupid realize stupid are. everyone stayed inside 4-6 weeks, allowing current infections pass preventing transmission, would end pandemic.

That'd absolutely crippling entire planet.  hella expensive though Sad Oh all. totally relate saying. like....10 days... things felt...good first time long time. cooperating once. then...boom

Yes, young healthy people die this. often, many, many get simply recover. Months later they're still dealing things like shortness breath, crippling fatigue, brain fog bad literally can't work anymore. 

You might want research start claiming thing people risking couple weeks illness return full health. facts emerging simply support that. scientists World Health Organization stated lockdowns damage COVID, used. Well virus kills like 1 10000 people 70 they've lockdown way 1/10000 lives, plus they're probably going get virus anyways. math really check here. Sweden.

So wanted reduce bit spread sacrificing order save money, would say that. Keep going work, keep using packed trains stop everything that. Kids school parents work.
As said don’t know virus spreading money made seems odd. point (if any) someone get reinfected. 

SARS stamped out, real data it, like 4 cold-causing coronaviruses, people get reinfected less SARS, best evidence antibodies last 2-3 years people serious case, T-cells indefinitely (though known gives sort immunity). that's far cry PROVEN duration immunity 4 cold-causing coronaviruses. stock market need stimulus bill, Fed print money endlessly, buy junk bonds, whatever wants without congressional oversight. working class involved suddenly can't anything.

In Israel large schook outbreak, apparently classes packed ""mask holiday"" hot. seems though small kids spread much. reason pass virus feces getting infected way might cause milder infection (there Scottish study health care workers without small children). Teenagers probably pass well adults.

In country study examined adults living household positive kid got infected. concluded kids spread it, although several adults got infected saying probably got elsewhere. However, prevalence low day personally know anyone would've infected, entirely buy it. ~~literally *any* given date~~

Come on, people *still* predicting *it'll end (whatever date)*, far, *every* prediction come true?

If making predictions, *stop it*! know would like over, order get done with, must choose *science-based* approach! many Westerners outlying/rural folks fall within Fox Entertainment bubble.

It seems part world fairly well.

I wonder dense city populations almost non-existent population density within 100 miles city (possibly even closer?) 

Australias total population 30million according google. 

Don’t know. Would like know Europe intense lockdowns spiking again. think it’s fair say Europe whole one population comes virus. you´re Dutch.. complain language? thats bold Again, third reich work well... understand sentiment America never needed “nationwide lockdown”. geographically large spread would completely unnecessary. Lockdowns don’t eradicate virus, control it. isn’t outbreak region need lockdown. 

With said, seeing poorly handled virus, way National Outbreak status nationwide lockdown starting look reasonable. Even though would near pointless lot areas. lot festivals set dates next year, mean happening. would take 3 days she'd need least 2 hotel stops, plus food gas restroom breaks entire way. still think driving safer things considered?

Probably? pretend scientist, take grain salt. guessing, two hotels, stops food, couple stops gas/bathroom/stretching way easier reduce contact people flying. What's handful desk staff drive operators couple days compared hours packed airport followed hours sealed tube hundreds people? Especially people think traveling right good idea exactly people would expect travel without testing even lie point view, nobody taking seriously. friends going home, coworkers going home, cousins going home. close friend's mom cancer still going home without quarantine sister feels like we're asking much

I empathy people see everyone around taking things seriously think want bad, really really do. God knows temptations go home. frankly family selfish reckless, someone knows better step bad guy. sucks fair, people could literally die. let sister stay go visit stays elsewhere, enabling complicit outcome. Even turns okay family specifically, make mistake exact scenario playing across country lucky.


Edit - got record, hypothetical trying preach. live across country sister family well. want go home bad know would let come without second thought, cannot justify flying reasons laid out. thought driving (it would 3 day drive well), ultimately know still irresponsible.

If *every* American governor would that... Biden win, power would issue national mask mandate? would need pass House/Senate? actresses Alyssa Milano Lena Dunham, lead singer Tool, various athletes heart issues. 


I'm sure more, ones know of. celebrities might want publicize it. image huge part career, describing wreck months could unappealing. France : healthcare workers positive asymptomatic required keep working. Assuming vaccine = immunity risky leap. vaccine could mean diminished symptoms. Vaccine could mean longer infectious.

We long long way go. Yeah thats exactly it, vaccinated people want told mask social distance lot friends like this, weird ""I'm young invincible I'll fine"" complex. Im constantly telling ZERO idea health like year now. 

First thing spout affects older generation underlying health conditions, tell asthma underlying, overweight health problem, chicken pox that's potentially underlying due fact lays dormant nobody knows covid re-activate it. know affect decide kids later, know...

But keep saying ""oh like flu I'll fine"" onset HIV flu like symptoms nobody wants want this.

Hell, even know future insurance accept covid since labeled pre-existing condition. already sense. Troll detected. Abandon thread. Look difference obesity rates. number one predictor dying contracting obesity (outside 70+ y/o) pre existing heart conditions like heart disease largely driven obese. 75%+ overweight obese population... wonder significantly higher death rate comparable PPE standards care.

Edit: France's density population outside Paris, Lyon, Marseilles much lower core costal cities. also nearly volume international air traffic. nations easily compared... confidence stirring though, kudos Yeah pandemic over, become endemic. Why?

Dems compromising bill best advantage, lead better chance snatching Presidency Senate seats. long run that's better, no?

It's process so, immediate interests general citizenry sacrificed. Whats dumb amount fans saying right enjoy moment team. need die get life ruined virus. 
every day finding new secuels manifest even asymptomatic carriers like heart, liver, brain kidney problems, infertility increased chance alzheimer's, etc.

 even ignore that, believe kid would feel realize cause father/mother grandpa's death? one going realize sooner later.

And irrelevant news. live north 37th parallel (the top Texas), probably vitamin deficient winter  Yeah, least keep interactions low, like close family members, easier contact trace. We've already essentially cancelled/reduced Thanksgiving Christmas year, brainer. Sounds pretty crumbly me. think perfect time it, maybe even little early. managed get october extremely well compared countries lockdown would've completely wasted month real struggle compared what's emerge. mean yeah theory would help lockdown country soon cases rising would mean shutting everything till winter possible. need find perfect time rising cases maxed ICU capacity get properly. Lol, good? met single person age 50 takes COVID seriously. probably misspoke, virologist. lot depend effective vaccine is, long antibodies hang body. thinking along lines virus strains cause influenza, rapidly mutate. It’s fact kids carry without showing symptoms...and there’s plenty evidence trending toward long term issues everyone carries virus. tested kid? like rolling dice kids health? Exactly. sympathy victims COVID—especially families lost children—while also acknowledging public health decisions need keep mind low risk average child. “Think children!” tugs public heart strings “Think 90 year-old grandfather.” 91% deads france 65+ yo. parents gonna fine too. 

I remind : 35000 dead 1,2m cases (in france) 0,03% mortality. It’s NOTHING. Stop afraid. article Rita Wilson says ""No, think so."" asked long term issues.

And Alyssa Milano's symptoms certainly dont seem serious.

As athletes, doesnt take much sideline somebody. heard actual names struggling symptoms?

Considering famous people *have* Covid, doesnt seem like serious long-term conditions popping often all, it? Yea, one Victorian Covid fetish would done covid one else will. REAL. PEOPLE FUCKING DYING EVEN PERMANENTLY SCREWED REST LIVING. FUCKING PULL TRIGGER, DAMN IT!!! can't enforce mask mandates/laws such? say manpower so, well hire people! better give people jobs strip millions people form livelihoods? 

I'm sure I'm dumbing way down, better way. essentially hoping, wishing, praying vaccine show 4-6 weeks. hate right.... sad. feel bad people posted qualified times run race. Interesting, given much Covid news changes time would wait verified multiple sources labs believing it. 3 weeks dry cough nothing really fixed seemed naturally go away. 

Personally I'd rather cough 3 weeks lockdown 3 months. right people 30 age range get unluckily bad case, % (to address question) still extremely low risk. think mortality maybe 1 2/1,000. 

Most people age group worry much liver disease despite fact roughly # 25-34 year olds succumbed affliction far year COVID. think 5x people group died car accidents year comparison purposes, yet people OK risk driving. # suicides group kind astounding extremely sad (8,000 deaths far age range 2020 compared 1,600 COVID). 

Obviously still spread far main issue obviously, thing EXTREMELY DEADY ages 70+.  Exactly Yep. right HIV. OraQuick saliva rapid home test.

Getting 30 million people spread across continent something much easier getting 325million people thing. Assuming referring America. 

Culturally social contract wise country much different. People rape steal too, wishing happen really solve problem anyone. live reality 100% compliance ever going happen. 

We need real plan involve locking every 2 months point people going say f*** I'll take 1/500 chance feed kids keep home. came better sure I'd take chance too. 

Longer goes on, less compliance get. fact can't arrest everyone. get terrible precipice, need truly rethink strategy. 

I'm sure structured approach funnel resources keeping high risk groups isolated safe, allow low risk continue working making sure 40 million kids little education year people pay bills. know. COVID sucks.

But know can't another 1-2 years. Yes, stupid. stupid people support fascist reality television star second grade reading level. Colleges wont back normal next fall. 100% believe colleges force students staff get vaccine coming campus, 100% people vaccinated, full class sizes without masks. utterly heartbreaking. I'm tears. got better way  Maybe I’ll try using goals accomplishments boss. It’s good enough White House! 80s. soon words ""underlying illness"" mentioned, people switch off. forget/don't care underlying illnesses necessarily death sentence. unlikely United States recover virus ever, citizen whos cleaner school even NY teachers still failing wear masks properly walk around forgetting masks general ridiculous  would try reopen schools places bombed. Please research resilience studies child psychology. Schools usually first thing reopen up. I've New York dozen times 'quarantine state' since March. Nothing enforced, political grandstanding Cuomo he's invested back now. keep need do. jealous streak No, busy protesting shutdown. don’t like masks either. can’t ways. yet hear armchair constitutional scholars part constitution government violating making people wear masks. It$ $omething web$ite$ needing click$ sell ad$ $pace live Bozeman, MT. I'm on-site work rural towns, I'm almost always person mask. rural folks still think real. businesses state-mandated ""must wear mask"" sign door, zero enforcement. Lol, lockdown spread virus Dec partying? brilliant plan came realization yesterday test like would make guest house possible. Safely. 

And then, it’s simply safe. 

But would work. people came over, home test, 5-15 minute results, could people 95% assurance aren’t carrying it. 

I’m really looking forward test like quick results home administration. Although I’m sure come 2025. Yea. aversion foreigners seems common lot Asian counties area, especially directed eachother. Immigration fairly 'new' grand scheme things, surprising happens, hopefully get better time.

That said, I'm American lucky enough tech position makes much, I'm keeping eye open options. Lol. Yup. coworker who’s roommate May. Started going recently, woke symptoms went test 5 months later again. not. It’s rly interesting alive covid 19 pandemic also taking college course systems governance. get listen professor lecture NGOs, global clubs like UN, also WHO. really look World Health Organization even listen look facts key points. There’s stake politicizing covid 19 think. opinion US losing major opportunity gain soft power working nations World Health Organization order combat covid 19. could’ve huge opportunity US economy thrive grow. think maybe hadn’t election year response covid 19 may better. reported 16 deaths yesterday. That's higher previous week day. *""Everyone disagree troll""* true walk risk, peopel retarded. allow go outside, hang large group... big difference german federal government budget surplus 10 last 12 years, governments used do, save money good times spend crisis Germany's debt GDP ratio lot healthier. Nah, Swine Flu million Obama chose test people.. (Second Time) Yup. I’m getting little sick tired mindset government officials saying “Mask up!” “Get take out!” “Avoid gatherings!” “Rethink holidays!” fuck nothing. veeeryy different. people charge still understand exponential growth

I'm sure understand exponential growth. hear exact sentence parroted lot. understand it? They're saying observed exponential growth rate European countries surprising. Countries responding it, hence lockdown. anyone understand maths bit arrogant assume that. body made challenge first reich really count... real aspiration world domination there. live Melbourne worst effected part Australia Covid I’ve honestly ever seen one person public wearing mask I’ve working different stores every week. 
I’ve seen quite people noses sticking wearing masks exercising it’s definitely exception rather rule.

There’s small protests restrictions morons people slack social distancing nothing like I’ve read what’s happening overseas. elections see numbers rising international travel density Belgium crazy high even primarily tourism. Czech different though - despite popularity Prague - along good measures time good reason evaded spring surge, primarily struck hard 2013 flight map international travel density. Lots people know go Prague, Belgium, flight maps, population data mobility data tell different story never would guessed, go long way explaining highest fatality per capita spring major european countries. healthcare capacity quite huge population. Things may much tougher round heading respiratory viral spread season virus much diffuse spreading widely less dense travelled regions. Oops... did. did. Multiple people multiple countries international event Wuhan go back home counties fever breathing difficulties. Yeah.

Why delete comment replying also? confirmed cases Covid19 France November 2019. arent aware this? Call doc sure. Also lots fluids electrolytes ... salt orange juice handle taste. Hmmm, wonder media determined spread misinformation, held accountable it. Even half success would impressive surprising. Trump literally delusional. Antibodies die out, antidodies persist. vaccine coming year, vaccine coming never. medicine, medicine. even 1 actually. like 6 runs, bases loaded, best hitter deck, manager letting starting pitcher who's gassed face music. there's one bullpen. That's straight bollocks, sent multiple sources also read replied yours, feel need defend.

Now depending arguing saying disagree may relevant simply entire point revolves around opinion fact, things objective.
Especially since head debate seems *what definition failiure*, never objectively determined.

Now, read these, decide main point is, go last comment, showing economy survived relatively (also sent one previously, showing total capacity ICU beds never one sent me, rather supports point view points main goal protection hospitals, knoe read first lines)

Further, said, let's take FHM's reasoning. Swedish, browser able translate you.

You consider whatever want win lose, never reply sources, fail solid main argument, lie providing sources replying you, fail reply direct questions go low insult intelligence even ethnicity, forgive thinking supposed claim victory ridiculous. pretend dangerous, need someone keep children parents working. kindergarten 3-18 old. I've yet see all. Positivity rate incorrect yet testing figures aren’t available today. Don’t know get number from.  better way let society collapse. Interesting thank information! really think million people die **of** covid? **with** it, primary cause? won't. Wisconsin legislature republican control even met attempted anything address Covid, completely abandoned responsibilities. Good call AutoMod...and call Shirley Cuomo handling virus ""proper"" funniest thing I've heard day. Even worst case scenario, vaccine issues, we'll much along treatments rolling rapid testing. can't really imagine anything within realm reasonable possibility we're not.  Ah, guess Hare Krishna analogy, parents already ashram might theoretically joined them.... parents typical born post-WW2 couple years college (after Dad got back Vietnam) kids. Even typical (also post-WW2) uncles go college got married / kids long high school.

I'm saying environmental concerns factor *anybody*, even 10,000 couples decided 0 children instead 2 3 enough cause birth patterns '70s. I'm saying decline birth rates '70s. definitely somewhat fewer kids. trying convey effects would larger places others, think economy would major factor visible not.

I looking fell internet rabbit hole. turns lot ink spilled birth rates fertility rates years.

The statistics get complicated difference birth rate (number births averaged whole US population) fertility rate (number births averaged number people actually give birth). article good explanation birth rates going keep dropping near future even fertility rate stays constant; graph also nicely illustrates fertility rates *fairly* similar (although 100% flat) 1975 now.

Americans' attitudes big families ought changed lot '60s '70s. Gallup polled people there's analysis see number people saying 4+ kids ideal, number people saying 2 went way up. number people saying children (which hypothetical environmentalists would be) stayed close zero. (Anecdotally: friend mine born late '60s showed parish directory small-town working-class Catholic parish late '70s. photos families. pointed even though Pope come birth control, *somehow* almost families three fewer kids.)

It also turns federal government caught flat-footed Baby Boom. realized much due people wanted kids war years couldn't, started surveying women many children intended have. report CDC's results 1973-1988 came conclusion big reason happened changes timing spacing women unusually low TFR persisted 1970’s 1980’s function changes occurring age pattern fertility. importantly, women reached late teens 20’s 1970’s 1980’s tending delay marriage childbearing later reproductive lives, relative women done past. tendency lowered birth rates women late teens 20’s beginning early 1970’s (9). Secondly, many women 30’s late 1970’s already experienced traditional age pattern childbearing whereby children born 20’s, birth rates time also low.

I considered that, fits long-term nature data better either Energy Crisis 1973 recession *The Population Bomb*. timing goes feminism birth control.

As last point.... think Gen X sort endangered species. We're smaller tiny. Nobody *talks* us much visibility prestige media coverage; ""war"" Boomers Millenials sucked oxygeon room. Gen X also pretty mixed bag lot cultural touchstones apply everybody it. (My older Xer friends memories watching ""H. R. Pufnstuf"" ""The Osmonds"" kids, and... well, I'm glad fell fashion.)

Members generation becoming visible, although know often they're recognized such. first heard Amy Coney Barret, first thought ""woo, GenX represent!"" ""gosh, going court really long time?"" seems barrier ""prominent"" also risen decades lot fields. GenX scientists may go two postdocs getting permanent job Boomer counterparts any.

Between 2000 2015 see much anybody public eye named Jennifer, Amy, Lisa, Kimberly, Melissa, Michelle, more. Watch happens Karen, Linda, Susan retire.... ""Conseil Constitutionnel"" say laws, can't activated citizens like that.

Also, people lockdown, also people considering useless harsh enough. okay,more old people die less money needed social budget.  people hospital serious condition. bring people hospital serious. 

Also, look current numbers, look increase. last week week, we've increase cases +70%. Take calculator look long Germany sustain increase beds out. remember everything take three four weeks see number cases hospital.

Now tell trouble. Please tell Spanish government.

All make everyone anti-lockdown now.

I stuck 25m2 room 2 weeks. mask 5g vax

What earth this? people even listen radio, vaccine comes instead 5g? /s Canadian govt work home till june minimum. data says vaccine wont till may 2021at absolute earliesr. Strongly agree. There's little cultural unity, social cohesion. lip service ""our"" nation, feels like bunch small natures, cultures, peoples, etc. living mutual resentment. “reinfection rare” generalizations staggering. comprehend many people fail recognize history repeating itself. Covid struck March, assumed children rarely suffered complications. Within matter months children presenting strange deadly symptoms alarming rate. Symptoms looked nothing virus told expect. assumed virus severely impacted underlying health conditions. Yet, teenage athletes identifiable health conditions died virus attacked organs, brain. anyone else remember picture young woman’s formerly perfectly healthy lungs quite literally eaten virus, received transplant? 

Now, battling latest mutation, appears 10X transmissible original strain rocked US March. really- don’t understand thing all. answers, any, real light end tunnel. reinfection occurring perhaps fatal hubris presume “rare.” determination hinges understanding virus don’t fucking possess point. idea complications may arise six months six years clearing Covid. Even tireless research done, we. don’t. fucking. understand. 

Honestly, I’m tired posts. It’s justification make choices endanger people complain bare fucking minimum help keep fellow human beings alive. good, I'm surprised much worse. Unfortunately combination everything. Schools, public transportation, people sick told do, bars, clubs everything...i see stop effectively without complete lock down...but again, i'm expert Didn’t know Covid can’t go top mask? come sides bottom. guy 100% safe!

/S guess say “people know church, also alienated me.” Someone reporting ""COVID-like symptoms"" =/= super spreader event COVID infection all. respectfully disagree, shutdowns people kept partying. It’s every individual politely antisocial decline invitations. could *ever* backfire /r/theydidthemath 1 news title ""As COVID-19 Surges South Dakota, Medical Groups Urge Masks Despite Gov. Kristi Noem’s Skepticism""

thanks god governor state. thank god mother kids. thanks god mother. Maybe got infected died. suffering long haul Covid hoping end say, “It overrated wasn’t bad all.” meanwhile passed loved ones died. illegal gatherings police shut violated rules assembly. (and probably noise complaints well.) could give shot I'll myself, lol. start selling vaccines tests 7/11 something. IM injections super easy. Ya know gotta hand Atlanta sports fans. remain loyal despite heartbreak. Falcons example would 4-3 right 4th quarter didn’t exist Translation: “Okay, people mad, try save face” 

What, y’all think Rob Manfred didn’t know positive cares player safety? definitely get tested via PCR (not rapid 15 minute), least twice, waiting least 5 days tests. tricky part everyone office tested could infected thru 2nd hand exposure many days later. Definitely put N95/KN95/KF94 indoors can. That's lockdown details given. Macron, President, giving big principles making political announcement. Practical details going clarified tomorrow press conference Prime Minister government.

But Macron said would form help compensation. Yeah would rather money going people aren’t making much smart working hard...they’re trying least, ambition...they got fucked coroporation refused move people up..something like mask mandate much authoritarianism clothing mandate. People acted like seatbelts laws well. comes empathy decency.  Nasdaq still 28% YTD what? told ended 7 days, next Wednesday election. title misleading? People continue going work school. Teleworking mandated. Isnt Netherlands finally experiencing flattened curve, thought numbers going down? Fuck man, thought take dower enough that's good point. Imagine fucking thing mutates end constant yearly cycle similar influenza. Fuck lol

People realize definitely get worse. Uhhh... one thing, boot camp mostly mind fuck diminishes ability think yourself. That's good thing long term. Secondly, ""snowflake"" syndrome seem referring freaking construct. can't believe people downvoting Well states different others. Mine phased approach low summer increasing too. Also, lockdown didn’t end abruptly- mainly loss credibility protests allowed occur. Sadly tail end looking good.
Some studies show even induce psychosis. beginning 7 months unemployed stuck inside home.

Fucking kill now. people decided extra precautions necessary affects personally realize careful.

Nah, em find way blame others 20 deaths Montana crazy.

If there's silver lining new cases deaths, every corner country new found respect good leadership, science hopefully better healthcare system pandemic said done. hate Facebook, certainly showed know horrible people. nice purge. farms NI? caught unknown virus early 20s. wasn’t flu doctor never determined was. healthiest still knocked ass almost 4 weeks couldn’t work. never hospitalized near-death. sick work. 

That job offered sick time I’m lucky didn’t fire me. hadn’t living parents time, would utterly screwed financially. don’t know possibility dismissed something worry (along unknown long term effects). can’t believe hard understand. Children aren’t little adults, can’t assume anything works adults works children.

Children major disease vector many infectious diseases, huge focus childhood vaccinations. Vaccinating children needs done control COVID-19z mean countries tried?

New Zealand beat twice, lot asian countries well. 

The confinement work, people smart enough follow rules act like idiots it’s over. Simple : wear mask, wash hands, avoid large gathering, quarantine infected, cannot spread. people don’t respect these. Sure tests harder access issue, excuse today. Multiple factors, mainly goverment fault lost people's trust. unprepared simply thought second wave even longterm strategy goverment reacting current numbers without vision. 

Also restriction goverment issued spring targeted political opposition used goverment pre-election time (senate elections october). reaction, even goverment tried downplay restrictions result, even face masks mandatory labeled sign goverment abusing power. elections, came facemasks restrictions downplayed previously, ""surprisingly"", people listening.

Part problem also almost every restriction, covid related data knowledge targeted false prophets ""experts"" people know believe. many false claims presented doctors (not experts - like stomatologist), scientists (not experts viruses) respected persons people gladly listening comforting lies see unpleasant truth.

Now, goverment hesitating new restriction lost people's trust, probably even self-confidence previous restriction second wave low effect (it's visible anything slowed progress look graphs). goverment scared restriction accepted people opposition, add new restriction, also add 10 exceptions (to good people), already clear, work day one.

Goverment also want fully open healthcare data, forced open least data, important data like empty beds incomplete public. Ministry interior want's add new paragraph law, kind data prohibited share. that's part story, people trust goverment now. like spend trillions preparing war, one one pitch help war effort.

This much easier blackouts ration cards buying war bonds. It’s just: wear mask, don’t drink bars.

So hard. entirely wrong there. true. thing would want can't right dine out, go bars, spectacles (concerts, theaters etc.) allowed literally everything else. People go work, go school, go shopping course exercise. tired winning yet? states remain open ones bailing states lock kill economy.   part able live contracted via someone care (or caring) come find may someone came contact ended dying... rules metaphorical waves next ones can't bigger. That's impressive mental gymnastics part. we'll probably see lot (much-needed) collective actions combat climate change social injustice, see taking prominent place society. sense like 2019.

Loool reason happening everyone bored home nothing do. things restart, everyone go back caring. average American family feed, job work social life enjoy then, nobody devote life marching around streets lighting stuff fire, getting beat police yelling “vote like democracy depends it!!!!” every election. It’s unsustainable anybody hoping “culture shift” sorely disappointed. Maybe new system they'll figure way actually post numbers three times week. middle ground ""it's hoax"" ""it's end world"".

Yeah, numbers could look quatify bad is! Isn’t lot? France people 35h week, that’s 9-17 count hour lunch. . . . cheating win baseball games create risk deadly infection? We're talking literal waves. Tech stocks driving growth market. market well outside  Health systems near capacity France\Germany, wouldn’t wise ignore shut instructions. think misunderstand healthcare works. can't solve capacity issues (not space also staffing) simple funding. countries EU shortage IC beds nursing staff impossible solve funding. current trend continues people lying floors every member state regardless funding funding used support protect affected areas economies.

I get certain opinion ""Brussels"" would cool would take time read I'm actually writing use facts figures support arguments. work Deep State I'm paid George Soros! muahahahahaha invest things stocks, nothing said implied stocks place wealthy people invest. hospitals overdrive Jeez, it’s bad Thanksgiving, after? way talked early media made seem like inevitable would probably less severe. Nobody predicted would 10x worse. Apparently newer strain now. Unsure worse mild lead people getting second time.

This comes doc friend keeps latest research Probably since federal government sitting around thumb ass. McConnell adjourning senate election basically guaranteed That's vaccine even works well enough all. There's absolutely zero guarantees they'll even vaccine gives enough immunity protection 10 years. :( Downwards trend going better worse?
Since implying downwards spiral could bad, numbers dropping would good..? Look Vermont.....or Wyoming....or North Dakota..... population per capita compared Europe? Must present different. first time won’t last Same. expect worse thanksgiving Thanks good post! ""Likely"" COVID............. mean matter-of-factly COVID.

Retrospectively confirmed case Dec. 27th: idea PDF from. Yeah ordered government. Restaurants Oslo also close 2100, fully closed adhere social distancing recommendations Look new York's infection rate since April. testing one lowest infection rates. first lockdown forbidden, think idea try nuanced approach forbid national level.

But ther cases nursing home free cancel visits. True, republican enablers longer support . Cowards flee talking about? Waves higher ones it. Ever seen waves get bigger storm? I've legit never seen cop wear one all. Germany here, confirm. shit far hear lots people making argument without ever providing evidence assertions. Maybe priority dealing problem that's right front faces: 300 people per day (and rapidly climbing) dying infectious disease. Braves blew 3-1 lead lol Yeah put context, kids staying home. ""behind"" anyone. one kid stays home, yes he'll behind kids stay home nobody behind. complained HR day lack mask wearing, people wear masks, surprise. course except owners/family company 70-80 years old. 

So wife owner (likely 80 years old so) comes goes “oh don’t mask better stay away you” lol

Then two minutes later guy HR lady brings goes “Id rip mask could wife’s nurse you’d never know covid existed”And HR lady goes “I know keep hearing !!

Is open hospitals low covid admittance good thing? feel like I’m going crazy person cares Ontop subtly outed owners  It’s county judge. Texas, highest authority short state correct. talking here, it’s bad r/coronavirus doesn’t mindset bad news. Always good treatment options. Fuck bitches, get money Yes, sort triage enormously emotionally costly. hit point, suicides within medical community skyrocket. Yep. actually gives two fucks health constituents. realise Trump still president almost February right? Even loses dude, people careers still probably would choose move America somewhere else. Solid infrastructure, rich cultural life, vibrant cities, low crime rate huge draws sort career lets live wherever want, tend cultivated social programs investing populace. people think every decision false dichotomy two extremes, choose one extremes. think confusing new cases total cases. open air superspreading events Denmark?  That's better expected tbh. We're already hovering 600-700 per day now. expecting see 1 2 weeks title end. lot places require masks enter, free masks could comply. nothing prevent dipshits taking masks throwing floor soon walk in. Dude ghost town first 2-3 weeks ""locked down"". go fucking anywhere. started see overblown everyone basically said fuck ...no investigation Astros though. Nice. I'm seeing things light party vs party, that's all.

I prefer group people interests, see interests different groups clash other. design, politicians interests align constituents democratic system -- that's whole point it. US system, winner-take-all voting scheme, eventually devolved two-party system, making people *not vote opposing party* valid strategy voting party.

For opposition, basically means denying delaying beneficial acts incumbent, stage way absolves responsibility. nothing republicans democrats -- parties opposition, valid strategy. sad part partisan politics become prevalent, people longer see PR parties put out. comment proves Completely non-scientific guess... People got flu shot likely take available precautions avoid COVID. acceptable number deaths? going deaths regardless power rules are. Pandemics decided politics, nature nature. risk people die myriad factors, yet none deemed unfathomable, like covid deaths are. People die, happens. vaccine, goal keep hospitals overwhelmed. Nobody thought going get without loss life. 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! Ok said I'm depressed would care salary? answer would something something pay really matter hollow inside something something imminent collapse something something global warming. I'll say enjoy what/when still may end abruptly moment reason another Yeah like War Drugs, telling people drugs obviously work.  Ok, pandemic ripping world fire, explanation excess deaths then? Wait mean crappy check? mean 1!!!! thought 1200 weekly monthly? wasn't, believe me, everyone else know NY barely left house 3 4 months. went supermarket like twice month. sitting third north Dakota terms death count. Well said, good thoughts points, great things think about. 
I agree part, guess I've hit point try recognize point return, waste unnecessary time someone want help... save someone might need use it, know? ‘Totally unexpected’, nobody warned time prepare...  Yeah, probably. 227,000D chess. government encouraging wants employers liable time constantly going recess covid reason google public health spending life expectancy look debt burdens, google suicides Maybe priority dealing problem that's right front faces: 300 people per day (and rapidly climbing) dying infectious disease.

If without causing catastrophic long term economic social damage kill far, far people sure not. drive ? fly Alberta Ontario see family Christmas. parents high risk know grandma 80 yr old cancer survivor. tried suggest coming home late November Christmas November type deal airports less busy people hopefully less places. Mom started crying hard panic attack point needing inhaler breath. Apperently Dec 25 important day fair cant spend child abandoned move west.

 keeps saying seeing one last time kill her, okay that. Apperently doesnt care potential guilt know killing parents. December's going rocky ride. true. Individual liberties absolute United States subject police powers state greater good public. Hey, that’s true! *Some* people like wave around mental illness reason covid responses bad absolutely nothing assist people mental illness and, fact, actively voting healthcare infrastructure would assist people mental illnesses! Looks like guys weeks ahead us. think Switzerland see sort lockdown 1-2 weeks hostpitals full. Seems like government needs happen order justify lockdown spite economic damage. thought surely opening schools would halt virus tracks... Hahaha, almost got quotation marks correctly! took second make sure had. Deflation, layoffs, bankruptcies. government respond exactly wrong way, taking way debt. Yap. Exactly like 5x people infected this. difficult test here. people calling 150x times ""covid line"" get doctor line test get attention. Well, ok, yes ... large concerts open percentage economy that? would say rounds zero. Definitely concerts bars happening.  Looking numbers week... conversation aged well :P True, end sight, people get this, closer get. end non compliant people finally get herd immunity burns responsible people finally come hiding. one political party America refuses anything further. It’s simple that. say “No” cannot stop them. Yeah...

But 1: family say four people, last person household still contagious day 14, thus virus still community. 

But 2: would never work practice, point out. 

Conclusion total lockdown weeks probably don’t work method permanently curb spread. used emergency break make health care system cope. “I driving physical therapy, got pulled over,” Branch said. “The officer said, ‘Do realize ran red light?’ said, ‘No, sir.’ memory even going light.”

Holy fk. scary. May press release hospital, Albert Schweitzer Colmar, eastern France.

It says first case Covid 16 November 2019.

This widely reported. L’un d’entre eux, l’hôpital Albert Schweitzer de Colmar, d’ailleurs fait état dans un communiqué, jeudi 7 mai, de premiers cas (de Covid-19) notés le 17 novembre 2019 dans l’Est de la France. Le Docteur Schmitt, après avoir étudié rétrospectivement de plus de 2 000 scanners thoraciques réalisés entre le 1er novembre et le 30 avril, décelé ""quelques cas déjà en circulation dans la région au début du mois de novembre"".

Which roughly translates One [hospitals performing analysis 2019 data], Albert Schweitzer hospital Colmar, announced press release 7th May first case (of Covid19) recorded 17 November eastern France. Doctor Schmitt, performed retrospective study 2000 thoracic scans made 1st November 30th April, declared ""some cases circulation region early November"".

You suppressing correct uncontroversial information purely due ignorance. stop. may keep dropping, Brazil suffered much wish healthy future! Tier 3 England lockdown too.  can't word surely used really wish people would stop ignorant kind shit. 

The Federal Government broad powers time emergency. rights unlimited. enumerated MULTIPLE times.

Jacobson v. Massachusetts case law supports position, well numerous amounts cases follow. schools shut down? even though nobody say it, schools open virus spread currently control. mean wrong cost tens millions lives. 

If happens, every hospital America fills up, people die sorts preventable shit well Covid. thing occurred you? 

Many people survive hospitalized. Without that, fatality rate rises significantly. that’s Covid deaths. 

Once hospitals full (and they’re already filling - instance, sorry anti-mask motherfuckers Idaho) heart attack, stroke, allergic reaction, car crash, even bad femur break lethal events. upvoted back (at least back 1) making chuckle! fool try /r/AskTrumpSupporters. guys mental triple somersaults avoid obvious fact. turn invisible one watching! Possibly state might really need mandatory point Sydney specifically (almost cases regional NSW). Everywhere else virus mostly locally eliminated stage.

It made sense Victoria, none states outbreak like far. That's QE works. QE goes bank reserves, enter economy banks lending money (not happening), government spending programs, also happening. also *actual* lockdown, half-baked shit. I'm saying opinion asked states work together, ""will not."" fact. actually ASKED work together, chose to, would representing fact. case, states choose work together, never given choice Federal government. think wish someone (the president) would've asked work together, would fact...or maybe better yet contained virus. Chill all. You’ve rounded curve. mean, I’m still falcons/Braves/Georgia fan main team Atlanta United. still like teams win hate lose I’m exactly paying close attention unless ATLUTD playing we’re like worst team league lol. Life hurts. Unfortunately think people thought much could safely rates low expecting “second wave” subsequent shutdowns fall. It’s probably way it’s going go vaccine proves effective least otherwise people housebound weeks sustainable Okay, outlined plan. I'm far. question: shutter businesses economy responds, get money cover head businesses are, virtue plan, generating income?

I know unpopular question. I'm arguing smart action response pandemic. realistic. can't declare money existence; must come somewhere.

There's nothing easy it. mask mandate much authoritarianism clothing mandate. 

Which also... unethical. comes empathy decency. 

This things force guarantee good basis societal rules. Name one done seeded virus much US March, *and* comparable border tracing logistics.  First wave handled relatively well Switzerland. lockdown around time neighbors stores, restaurants, schools closed, curfew. Cases went close zero, let go almost restrictions much faster countries. Clubs open, events way 1000 people held, masks required public transit everyone acted Covid over. Thanks cases slowly crept starting August situation got really control somewhere October. tougher measures lockdown like spring still seems question, countries like Germany France fewer relative cases announced lockdown (albeit less tough spring) today. feel first hope actually getting thing control flu season. many people give shit right now. Unfortunately, gey worse changes. looking end year later enough people finally take seriously something different. then, even fucked, take even longer tgose changes behavior appreciable impact. think title misleading, ""medical attention"" hospitalizations included ""hospitalizations, emergency room, urgent care visits and/or physician office/telemedicine visits"".

Given sample size, 3.7% absolute reduction translates 15 fewer ""medical attentions"", many likely hospitalizations.

I'm saying good outcome, seem automatically game changing. Apart able go actually good year me. I'm ok help let bad drown good. 

The pandemic sucks. Everything sucks. there's lot going awesome proud of.

Also got 100k raise year that's nice US needs federal aid multiple fronts—fighting Covid (higher PPE production, consistent federal assistance wrt testing tracing, consistent plan messaging go along it) *and* financial relief people. Instead, got neither things. US, whole, “waging battle” *any* front. anyone say success beyond me. ""ok. Lol.""

- I'm guessing something like 80% Californians

Seriously, effective expecting be? going enforced? We're planning smaller one year masks obvious reasons...but following like half guidelines. then? guarantee family changing plans past already have.  gone Easter. 2024. time REALLY nasty pig/bat flu breaks Cambodia.

And Trump tweet Florida owned covid-19. What? didn’t say “go talk parent thing”. person did. 

This isn’t comforting parents. I’m sick people saying crap like person said acting like covid certain death sentence, even kids. generous us tax payers provide benefit pay $1250 dose top paid help get made. 

Thanos right. Oopsie Go Germany, get dat degree, learn German, stay while....a long while. I’ve read Japanese sites incident South Korea involves mishandling box vaccine doses supposed refrigerated instead kept room temperature. Yet still kept using box even noticing error. It’s also vaccines different what’s distributed Japan. I’m sure it’s stuff ones distributed areas world though. **BECAUSE PAYPALS SUCK...**

# Third spike? Officials warn Houston COVID-19 uptick could become surge #

*Andrea Leinfelder | Oct. 28, 2020 | Updated: Oct. 28, 2020 7:34 a.m.*

A rise COVID-19 cases health care officials government leaders pleading Houstonians: Act prevent, least minimize, third wave infections across Greater Houston.

“This feels lot like late May, early June saw early warning signs things beginning increase,” Dr. Marc Boom, president CEO Houston Methodist, told Chronicle Tuesday, “and things slipped control.”

According Chronicle analysis, seven-day rolling average newly reported cases 1,044.2 Monday eight-county Houston area. That’s highest since Oct. 8. summer, rolling average peaked July 17 2,432.7.

The rate virus spreading, called reproduction rate, reached 1.18 across nine-county Houston area Monday, according Texas Medical Center. number 1, Houston area report weeks, means virus burning out. number 1 means virus spread increasing. COVID-19 spike summer, Houston’s reproduction rate 1.5-1.7 range things getting control, Boom said.

Finally, seven-day average COVID test positivity rate 4.2 percent TMC hospital systems Monday. 3.4 percent last month.

For city, Mayor Sylvester Turner Monday reported positivity rate 6.5 percent Oct. 21. Statewide, positivity rate 9.42 percent Monday.

Turner, held fewer coronavirus-specific news conferences recent weeks due city’s previous lower positivity rates, felt compelled address public.

“It’s moving wrong direction,” Turner said. “Before goes much that, important us sound alarm people city Houston. remind people virus, manage virus, large part depends us.”

Houstonians know fight COVID-19. succeeded lowering cases summer COVID-19 strained hospital systems.

A major factor local statewide orders wear masks. Face coverings prevalent grocery stores offices, people may getting lax personal lives.

“They’re tired friends neighbors families, they’re letting guard down,” said Dr. David Callender, president CEO Memorial Hermann Health System. “We believe that’s impact terms new cases we’re seeing.”

At Memorial Hermann Houston Methodist, hospitalization intensive care unit capacity remains manageable. Boom said hospitalizations Houston Methodist comparable peak bad flu season.

And officials hope flu season mirror mild season seen Southern Hemisphere (where typical flu season April September), they’d rather rising COVID-19 cases flu season.

“These metrics concerning, worried could first signs trend wrong direction could sicken Houstonians strain hospital system,” said Turner. “We power right stop uptick even becomes trend. power stop virus getting hand like seeing parts country West Texas.”

Houston-area case increases severe parts country state. U.S., 489,769 new cases reported since Oct. 20. surges Wisconsin Midwest states. El Paso, state health officials converted convention center makeshift hospital ease crush patients.

Still, Shreela Sharma, epidemiologist UTHealth School Public Health, knows quickly COVID cases climb. said number new cases Houston region roughly 40 percent higher summertime peak began. means third wave occur, would start higher baseline.

The time wear masks, practice social distancing wash hands.

“Our window right now,” said. “We could rapidly lose window next weeks.”

Good COVID behaviors especially important holidays approach. Sharma said best gift give social distancing, also realizes many people want celebrate.

She urges planning holiday gatherings family outdoor events. staying inside, allow outside air circulate area. Limit gatherings 10 people consider grab-and-go food — items don’t require people touching serving spoons.

Boom recommends NBA bubble-inspired celebration: family members extra vigilant two weeks gathering, get everyone tested days gathering, enter family bubble stay — don’t let kids escape see friends.

He also suggested driving see family possible. flying, recommendations included mask (preferably N95 respirator), goggles face shield.

Callender believes somewhat normal fall winter everyone wears mask. holidays, likewise recommended gathering outdoors avoid eating together small, enclosed spaces.

“You come together, others, celebrate. use precautions do,” said. “It won’t perfectly normal. understand that. it’s closer normal, think time that’s appropriate.”

Attorney: ""Not attempted murder."" Americans observe come conclusion? desperately need automated cameras using countries approach entrance, camera side glass door (to prevent crazies like vandalizing it) thermal scan ""facial recognition"" check mask on, automated door slide open.

In countries work fine, US probably better upgrade doors thick plexiglass seriously insane anti-maskers can't shoot camera.

Put mask freeze outside sidewalk without twinkies antisocial Neanderthal plague rats. look [WHO's definition IFR neither uses total population calculate rates:

*There two measures used assess proportion infected individuals fatal outcomes. first infection fatality ratio (IFR), estimates proportion deaths among infected individuals. second case fatality ratio (CFR), estimates proportion deaths among identified confirmed cases.*

There's mention total population either definition. seeing total population used calculate figures? I'm honestly seeing anywhere.

But moving past definitions, think get saying, pay attention many people dying percentage total population? Ahh yes, sophisticated legal terms ""illegal action"" true, it’s matter administrative competence political will. visitors another country stuck early COVID travel suspended. go home needed exactly this... negative test within 96 hours boarding plane. really problem CA county. Free drive test results 2 days. Scheduled online. actually twice first flight canceled right departure. Personally would extend time like week prior boarding case problem test (which absolutely occasionally happen). Sure increases total risk seems like reasonable compromise Living small rural town. need wake call. messy look like this. forced rush lockdown, didn’t think would go fast. Last week said would risk 50 000 cases two weeks didn’t go curfew, hit 4 days later. 

Just enacted curfew regions added many two days later. screams amateurism unpreparedness. 

The denialist movement virtually impact France, government thought could mitigate virus cases already roof. People purely skeptical hard lockdowns main problem here, rest agenda thats becoming actively dangerous now. getting point hospitals getting stressed locally overwhelmed. Actively encouraging people break guidelines, slamming local mitigations meant preserve hospital capacity, downplaying preventative measures like masks distancing going enhance spread end killing people areas hospitals struggling. one thing let stuff run rampant cases relatively low, they're significantly increasing everywhere going end killing people COVID people non Covid emergencies coming months. crap needs end. store cameras exist reason, attempted murder one. getting shot stabbing someone racial situation, or? idea many countries state permanent lockdown months still seen persistently high cases? imagine misery unemployment destruction social life unappealing majority people? considered irresponsible public health ""experts"" deceive people thinking lockdowns sustainable effective way eliminate virus 95% countries outside handful fortunate ones?

Agreed. least article points could explanations association Radboud scientists colleagues found. instance, people choose receive flu shot may health-conscious likely follow COVID-19 prevention guidelines individuals get vaccinated.

Phone tapping, bribes, paparazzi photography outright lies exposed time time again, nothing changes. Brexit agendas divided population made harder trust news outlet, sadly BBC lost credibility run last general election even trying anything government news agency. 

The government seems following Trump playbook saying whatever takes get current conversation rather hard work consulting might closer action thinking things through. called leaders appear manipulated shady figures background work harder protect voted power. 

Social media awash conspiracy theories state sponsored lie factories seeking erode confidence democratic processes institutions.

The financial crisis 2008 forced crippling austerity measures British population responsible got away Scot free. Since then, wealth gap rich poor increased trend shows sign reversing. Yet see government suddenly able find billions prop economy suits purposes, hand huge wads cash cronies botched, shambolic, piss-takingly crap solutions like Excel based track trace systems.

Devolution real possibility due sincerely held belief Westminster longer serves best interests huge swathes population, would better without meddling affairs. 

And friends relatives dying Covid-19, confused contradictory rules can't even go pub bit light relief. 

The people Britain whole stoic bunch put lot. surprised struggle find source information trust, patience establishment wearing thin. There's much people take. rest world, think America world's laboratory. We'll learn lot misery herd immunity effects COVID body. say Americans team players... way pendulum swinging rn lot people - facing death favorable.

And comment currently majorly upvoted. sub crazies.... across globe it’s starting show relying individuals “local governments” doesn’t work. countries seem well ones strong government responses (Asian countries/AU/NZ) Learn English posting, also I'm American. dumb be? bring shame ancestors played numbers, European countries u.s. States like said number ridiculously low hope catching cases

If turn news US currently seeing happens terrible testing comes home roost unfortunately testing Sweden even worse US sane person feel abandoned government America. testing available anyone's ton assists place help people get sick lose jobs. 

Covid far worse Europe US right now. France 50,000 positive cases one day last weekend 1/5 population US has. would equivalent 250,000 positive tests one day US test more. 

Sorry situation really like people US shit talk US. pretty nice here. Except, buying time low case counts extremely valuable. better spiking high levels last four months? Nobody promised would easy, impossible going shortage unprecedented acts depravity unprecedented crisis.

As primarily scientists welcomed idea forum including discussion economic, social, (relevant) political impacts outbreak. welcome devolving tabloid-level coverage daily, local trauma. Even said incidents verifiable. actually likes holidays much? reaction bullet proof reason see anyone Thanksgiving remains “yesssssssssss.” Typically abouit 30% Canadians get flu vaccine year, recent years like 40%.

I expect lot higher year. much early demand far. great news true already got flu shot besgs someone make meme:

Scientists: need make new flu vaccine every year vaccines target specific virus strains

Also scientists: year's flu vaccine offers protection Covid 19.....by accident. though?

I thought even came supporting lockdowns now. article even says smaller lockdowns France ineffective.

I read anything contact tracing data France US primarily spreading family gatherings.

Forcing businesses close shpuld strongly supported data effective done. Stupid people everywhere, Europe leaders actually never denied existence covid. listened scientists first wave limited locations. experience first wave (because good leaders scientist s) started deny existence covid. idiots including blame government. !remindme 7 days here. House coronavirus advisor

That generous label considering little advisement White House actually accepting. since COVID flu related

Huh? left Texas 8 years ago still friends Austin Beaumont. Beaumont friends say nobody wears mask thinks still hoax. One guy timeline still posting 0% influenza admission rates numbers fake.

I lot friends think hoax. Including two caught it. *Well kill me, bad* Maine hospital system handle outbreak. Ct added banned list now! love maine hope numbers stay down. can't believe many cases linked one wedding!  Dat Asian Century, thanks Trump Covid! certainly taken recent action.

We closed bars restaurants like half counties. Everyone *pissed.*

Schools going go back closed many places. 


The next step would suspending elective procedures, closing nonessential businesses, strong suggestion work home.

Those best tools, have. think retail establishments low risk, mostly bars restaurants. Large hospital systems spending lot time preparing wave. 

Many states nothing plan place. enforced, loud minority going screech. Four? I'm aware Venezuela, three?

And like Venezuela stable right now. inflation rate 53 million percent past years...

Not done it. have. people definitely struggling right now. tru;( think focusing wrong part comment. thing sucks word *plans* holidays plans. before? No. I'm sorry, no.

This ""I care one fault other"" attitude utterly horrible. I'm fed hearing ""both sides"".

It sides. absolutely isn't. Thanks random Asian supremacist Germany, many "" Covid poster child"" apparently, tests 1.2 mio per week 8.3 times population. Guess what, per capita similar/lower Sweden: 1423/100k Germany vs 1485/100k Sweden ... Maybe next time play bit numbers making statistical assessments sir fees dont exhist thought NHS heroes? happened clapping, rainbows banging pots pans?! may differ beliefs - something like happens you’re essential service it’s state emergency. Seems like entire point book went completely head. Might want stick books pictures them.  Probably see worst scenario bumped another percentage point. 1% becoming 2% already fuckedup genocidal proportions, could become 3%. imagine 3% Americans dying covid19. Clean things!

They've watched Contagion. It’s fucking crazy government really trying pretend it’s give another stimulus. Politicians also using creative definitions ""beds"". state reaches bed limit, 1,000 beds slammed stadium. Boom, bed number problem solved.

Except, quality care inside mass trauma stadium center far usual levels.

Counts ICU beds ventilators little accurate... Except need highly trained staff operate these. air dropping 1,000 ventilators stadium ain't going help much. think lot big stores cancelled Black Friday year moved sales online. Unfortunately seem happening Maine. currently 766 active cases, highest number active cases we've seen throughout, daily new cases 7 day moving average currently second highest point we've seen, clear upward trajectory. 

I know numbers seem low, we're tiny old population wise, we've handled well far, disturbing see serious upward indicating trends winter coming.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 🤔 Sturgis, Alex? safe assume number infections first wave fivefold tenfold higher detected testing, due lack tests back then

It's funny back April/May doctors actually said many people coronavirus thought, meant fatality rate much lower 3 - 5% people claiming .. called charlatans quacks videos censored. take guess combination factors:
- age majority infected trending lower (carelessness, essential workers, etc)
- therapeutics (steroids primarily) improved overall understanding treat symptoms general course disease improved
- deaths typically lag couple weeks (though death rate appear lower previously)
- testing: still don’t effective testing regime US results often late properly isolate/contact trace availability get tested increased capturing mild cases

My biggest concern numbers infected increasing rapidly hospitals unable provide level care we’ve seen “quiet” summer months workers resources stretched we’ll begin see poor outcomes increased deaths. 

Cities vulnerable due potential sheer number cases needing hospitalization rural areas limited number hospitals healthcare workers quickly drained. 

With spread everywhere won’t see grand displays support (hospital ships, military doctors nurses) demand help may outpace ability shift resources. 

Stay home, wear mask, inject bleach, take care eachother! Turning curve bigger circle started with... could government gave shit people. Maybe soon will! know history doomed repeat it?
You'd think would learn, grow, better... noooooooooo.... also beat Vietnam war.

What platoon in? talking symptoms, fatigue, low-grade fever, headache. thinking, ‘I hope don’t anything like don’t want mess school work,’” Katelyn Evans, 16, Green Township, Ohio, said.

Poor kid getting introduction adulthood years early... respect, maybe china's trials better luck. probably give vaccine ethinc minorities spray covid. I'm talking asymptomatic cases. I'm saying get sick, test positive, recover 2-6 months later get sick test positive considered reinfection presented enough evidence get infection re-emerging, although enough evidence official stance change. cases tracked quantified firm data people think everyone getting infected good thing stop insanity. Actually multiple Poland 8.7, 10 point remains hasn’t happened yet.. he’s wrong. sounds like someone wants sit locked away bedroom rest life Imo schools open months schools aren’t big people think. mainly schools spike would happened august September.

I know, surprised hadn’t posted failed mention punchline

I didn’t mention anything, title post title oppose lockdowns

You’re coming across combative. 

The article isn’t anti-lockdown. promoted “middle ground” approach. 

From Dr Nabarro told Spectator economic impact small countries rely tourism increased poverty levels two major effects shutting communities ""We really appeal world leaders, stop using lockdown primary method control,"" ""Lockdowns one consequence must never ever belittle, making poor people awful lot statements seem call end lockdowns, message consistent piece written Dr Nabarro days Titled, Reflections Middle Path, advocates governments around world find balance restrictions normal life.  terms deaths - no, worse average, think. holding two women store police arrived. Someone get man raise. Thank God live area rules. still don’t know anyone got virus 99.9% survival rate. Exactly. ""Figure reason"" due legal issue, due fact tell reason, nonzero chance anti-masker going get anti-mask activist friends cause trouble sue, even suit merit. let's clear, suit would utterly lack merit.

But even meritless suits mean suck time energy. recruiters almost never say actual reason hire someone. do, make answer vague possible, vein, book “Factfulness” excellent exploration topic. book presents bit history lesson, calls attention things commonly believe going badly, fact things better time recorded history (e.g. extreme poverty/hunger). 

It’s easy lose perspective without examine historical context situation. book serves optimistic reminder progress humans made. 

We still ways go. oh stabbed dude 27 times. Jesus christ looting nyc lot stores soho neighborhoods started this. Benefit applies mask compliance too. missed best attorney says attack premeditated over-charged.

Fucking cunt. teenagers buddy poster skateboard said “‘cause vines heal, chics dig scars.” Thanks reminding that! mean, legal counsel asserting case I'm sure point is. competent legal counsel would assert defendant. That's job. rise may never guaranteed trend stopping seen roll tanks upon citizen yet still going buy products today global economic power. citizen meaningless let's face it, country league treat like pawns shit fact many country isolate that.

Also surprised seem able trust people anymore look west handle pandemic. Countries like tear us apart inside simple misinformation always enough people buy falsehood thing long share view. Australian way: make illegal fine it, tax it, arrest non-compliance.   think legitimate question fact whether premeditation not. Really jury convinced, factors like happening heat moment, nature weapon, exactly stab happened call question level intent harm.

I'm saying can't make strong case premeditated, US standards plenty room make valid legal argument wasn't, usual us redditors making snap judgment based single article half-assed accounting facts probably best way arrive conclusions fairly impartially. got prison August. issued masks month covid swept camp never wear them.

However full lockdown destroy economy. want another one US well read tons ppl still financially recover first wave. bubonic plague IMO economy goes shit hospitals gonna run money anyways, everything gonna stop ppl really gonna dying massive numbers. bcs virus tho.

Not true, unfortunately.  may feel violent people insane, truth every person capable violence, even self defense. strongest disciplined people capable totally non violent circumstances.

You may think capable it, are, human. choice, chosen violent. Good you. Well, admit catchy one-liner. get context comment appreciate actually read article.

The context I'm approaching bitches put gigantic man critical condition fucking comb knife. Done. select Covid-19, High Priority Disease?  Yep, really need look selling it. Amazon mean buy Amazon.

Btw, found sad picture locking mask listings: Maybe someone strick motivational poster, like keep following rules dont need forever kind anti-masker targeting thing. idk edit: picture sfw/sfwfh, panic. Jokes you. There's already tv show it. called FOXNEWS. accurate tests? actually read wrote acting butthurt like weed?

I mentioned restaurants, bars, dispensaries draw crowds and, no, keep masks 100% time social distance. also mentioned schools. stop pearl-clutching. 

I believe stay home order occur. Polis Company basically decided tax revenue important enforcing public health. simply care many people kill always play games official count. may ""officially"" 100,000+ cases tomorrow, reality, three times number. Colorado test potential cases test first outbreak March. point rehabilitation point? Australia submissive populous used culture nanny state. random police checkpoints everywhere, extremely high taxes curb things like drinking smoking, speed checks everywhere mail tickets home simplest infractions. people culturally used government control. 

The government made lockdown protests illegal, made leaving home illegal albeit exceptions, illegal family members visit other. start outbreak locked people couple high risk spread apartment towers. Many people speaking said like prison, reminded war, stripped basic rights like access food. People outside towers lived literally slept cars. 

You get picture. least find quickly respect masks.   moron lying turd. Ugh. approve vaccine without large scale testing data? we're going surrender let crazy people control society operates? we're rounding corner? Yes Donald Trump directly responsible man stabbed dozen times. tried murder agree. saying.

Actions consequences. freedom speech, speech used actively make pandemic worse, surprised people make decisions based that. Pro-life, too, likely. Sucks eh? Yah eh, totally sucks. Pass another brew eh. Sucks. 🇨🇦🍺 ""It's beginning look alot like Christmas""!  ""But mah **FREEDUMBS!**""

-Woman stabbing man 27 times eat vitamin d? Can't pandemic endemic... *taps head guess say ""recent action"" mean really effective changes doing. States better others thing last month taking half-assed stabs (like closing places certain times certain places places enforcing them... applying political solutions biological problem. virus keep going places remain open). 


My big issue KNOW works. know exactly stop virus tracks we've seen work effectively countries (like South Korea, New Zealand). refuse instead implement relatively weak, unenforced, stabs things keep staggering along in-between state nothing really gets better everything keeps staggering along, grinding us dust. Haven’t heard? countries shitholes. Oh absolutely, I'm talking total numbers overall continent.

Bringing every little statistic know I’m really talking better shouting ‘all lives matter.’ You’re arguing didn’t like original comment, anything value add. People wearing masks to. wear restaurants bars, dumb, especially time limits people sit hours chatting. People really keep indoors taking bites drinking. -\_-

&amp;#x200B;

Not mention, lot outbreaks happening within communities, inside people's apartments. much harder control people meeting indoors...which I'm bit skeptical makes sense lockdowns things...it'll lead people meeting home. Sure, think goal half decent society reduce needless deaths much possible. Letting pandemic ravage world kill hundreds thousands people economic systems ill-equipped effectively counter can't waved away fact people die needlessly causes. Excuse me, take full responsibility. fault came here. China's fault.

- Donald Trump Germany third US population less five percent COVID casualties. Germany discussing partial lockdown face winter wave, economy recovered better expected Germany get away relatively mild measures. tackled initial wave strict lockdown people followed simple rules lockdown slowly lifted summer. Hopefully Shit Brains won’t ballot thrown agree, NJ awesome...I Maryland “crushed curve” second wave. Hospitals re-opening COVID units. Well, live authoritarian rule 1987. Maybe US it'll eventually good us come side regime! time VP conveniently assume control dies COVID-19 complications. ""Now we’re going toward 50 -- I’m hearing, 60,000 people. One many. always say it. One many, we’re going toward 50 60,000 people. That’s lower -- know lower (end projections) supposed 100,000 people,” Doesn’t screenshot literally say “Ending COVID-19 Pandemic” right sentence relative thinks exact thing. Also daily update Belgium COVID update: Daily death toll highest level since April, new hospital admissions (689) exceed first wave's record

- New cases: 13,571
- Positivity rate: 26.4% (+1.8)
- hospital: 5,554 (+294)
- ICU: 911 (+102)
- New deaths: 139

I’m gravely worried Belgium :(

For per capita reference, Belgium 11.5 million people. already one world’s highest death rates spring wave alone (nearly 0.1% entire population) bill worked on, dem's going pass ""smaller"" bill repubs going pass ""bigger"" one. held captive congress. people squabbling side ""worse"", losing sight using us pawns F\*\*\*ed game. Happy freedom day, know we're right end - hope things start improve you, tough many - many thank personally, know effort helped thousands thousands people like you, efforts helped - see come side.

Melbourne, I'm fucking proud you. Sending love Geelong statistics mathematics. 
If people free mingle 24 hours day vs 18 hours, six hours necessarily mean less human human interaction. 
Same concept wearing mask keeping physical distance others *cut down* gross number people getting infected. 
A lockdown improves math statistics lowering number potential chances infection spread. Wanted make sure didn’t miss photos... 500k cases says! Like peanuts! Hah. What's death rate now? good numbers. Exponential growth going eat time.  I'm sorry what? way describing things sounds like might depression that's really COVID related. person moron doesnt believe virus real. also sound different gerrymendering anyway: playing populations districts win elections. that's already done bad level normalized sides (though guess Republicans more) see next ""solution"". didnt opposite, thats misunderstanding is.

Lockdown scale, scale Swedens  volontary/virtual lockdown Norways lockdown similar eachother Norway example spain/australians ""housearrest"" type lockdown.

On scale 1 10 1 life 2019 10 full housearrests citizens. Sweden 3, Norway 4 Spain 9.

I agree rest though, Sweden long time used political tool US. Conservatives usually hates Sweden beacause left politics. reason dont time misunderstood Swedish left approach - essentially paying people stay home instead much cheaper locking people up. fellow Melburnian, every time read news shit show America, think is, thank God Daniel Andrews! lockdown tough, economy taken beating, prioritised health well-being community all. America hand lockdown description, prioritise health population, economy still taken walloping, perhaps biggest walloping countries there.

We're even close halftime! Yes, government absolutely can. don’t think doesn’t mean can’t. Debt irrelevant, made concept. doesn’t matter big number las keep producing, squash this, get back production normal, like NZ. Prolonged semi-shutdown like we’re reason we’re continuing decline Pay get fuck out. Man, kind world live days. Comments like make sad. We're talking global pandemic people perhaps kicked streets still assholes think, ""pay get fuck out"".  


Shit sad see. hope get better friend. Per capita, France worse USA. competition. shitting Europe peeved Europe wants shit us reason. they're already rolling reviews, FDA not. I'm going polite deserve say: 

Pregnancy contagious. 500-1000mg Magnesium Glycinate (was 500mg, bumped up) 5,000-10,000iu Vitamin D. real achievement Dr Merkel unify ever-bickering state leaders country.

I think every reasonable citizen must grasp magnitude situation now. Everyone us needs part act accordingly. hope restaurants either open court decision get missed revenue payed government. invested heavily good safety measures like air cleaning plastic shields far know, none spreading virus. Everyone really *should* right work study home fullest extent possible. totally possible make move. harder right now, still possible. wife coworker relocate Washington state Switzerland. whole family spend two weeks quarantine arrived, made journey. biggest issues trying assimilate new culture severe social distancing protocols. Ok colonizer. Perfect. Ghosts ever lingering threat death make Halloween extra spooky year.   obviously Pelosi's fault! adjourned senate refuses negotiate! /s sad thing is, still wouldn’t able see families Covid. need give seniors safe way interact family members. Depends goal suspect. Getting zero seems unlikely (unless there’s also plan somehow stop travel ends) even still, seems like they’ll need couple months get things low.

Then again, suppose could avoiding overrunning hospitals completely breaking cycles spread then. Gotta get back work pretty sure see increase deaths (at least Texas) summer honestly entirely sure scientist data analyst look deep we’re seeing.  can’t catch break. wasn’t ethical, would set scam business fake charities something take advantage numerous idiots...

Damn ot sucks decent human being. could getting filthy rich. think reason line tossed around 2018. way caravans trumped much right practically incoming invasion...then fox news stopped reporting day election. them, left's version that. GOP projection again. Yes, good point--Today's 13,571 cases actually equal 380,000 US cases really outrageous. forest fire, worry, bucket water you! shit day need vent. News like can’t understand many Americans. many people believe either 
1) virus released purpose stop Trump getting re-elected 
2) virus hoax distract us news coming election cycle evil scary Biden/Harris are

Really? whole world elaborate hoax stop Trump? many Americans think world events happen spite us....that important entire world would go along fool us. 

Look, love country, serious shit work out. don’t necessarily find joy wearing mask, I’ll definitely need go out. even made best shituation bought mask like mind wearing little less. 

And exactly would worldwide pandemic stop Trump getting re-elected? handled poorly incompetence undeniable. say it’s stop him, you’re basically saying he’s capable handling situation. 

I didn’t want man fail he’s president country, god. He’s found every way fail think pandemic more.  Saw picture woman holding sign read “Id rather die covid loneliness.” Sad we’ve done. “My body choice” doesn’t stop young women. elderly want see families allowed to. New high score!! Age, improved treatment, higher rate detection minor cases. I'm sure lot people give take chance borrow Merkel bit solve crisis Netherlands? also happen. states may way US government pick everyone's bills, reimburse lost tax revenue states. happen. We've turned corner! going away like miracle. Bless Trump golden god, strong man beating virus saving America - alone make great again.

/s mother lives Texas careless. might ever see again. perish, we're soon possible. country become shithole country collapsing. Asked relatives going. told two people- separate families- covid? Don’t pay attention. 

It’s normal day lot happens happens. really happens expect story change. Don’t forget, learned early pandemic virus grows exponentially 6 day doubling time. 

I recently made graph (because couldn’t find one) figure long takes dying start hospitalizations suddenly rocket up: mere two weeks. don’t follow case numbers except general trend - many local national governments fuck around data. Unless China, can’t hide hospitalizations deaths, least long. Länder bosses choice comply disempowered Bundestag declaring epidemic emergency natl. level.

Yeah thing exist. Bernie lost primary centrists consolidated one candidate (Biden). reason Bernie early wins centrists split among Pete b, Biden, Amy k, etc. Meaning DEMOCRATIC electorate didn’t want progressive ideals- wanted centrist.

If progressive ideals lost dems, imagine much he’d lose general among Republicans independents.

It’s terrible argument America really wants move away capitalism. Sites like reddit Twitter amplify views, means popular enough general population win. Listerine essential oils it... 

Eucalyptol 0.091% w/v

Thymol 0.063% w/v

Menthol 0.05% w/v

I going make assumption study talking about. Say what?  oil, guns tax. Seriously, admin turns everything us them, freedom science. Chinese person, Western mainstream media really good using data, worthy ""mainstream"" media ""Western countries""!

The media always provides angle numbers want, they.

&amp;#x200B;

I could also study ""Which country world stupidest face coronavirus?""

I'm guessing number one America, 90%. Honestly spread rural areas going much harder deny soon. people brainwashed might breaks it, people circle start dropping like flies. 

It's easy brush something affecting ""others"", see reality eyes. president made dangerous gamble embraced ""it disappear"" mantra, eventually going affect everyone. Yes is. Mitigations school systems heavily underfunded left states. shrugging shoulders scenario. Many school systems, especially south midwest, basically put nominal guidelines place went back normal. Yeah I'm glad people wearing masks Stockholm. I'm North, lot people live Stockholm people yet cases doubling Stockholm 😩 I'd bet alcohol peroxide based mouthwash reduce chance spread lung throat virus bacteria, tiny bit. better dental health increases survivability many diseases healthier person less underlying infections well establishes persistent bacteria breed colonies teeth gum holes. ;)

So kind like DUH.. yeah GENERALLY cleaning mouth help infectious diseases spread mouth. Obviously though effects short lived mouth stay anti-bacteria/anti-viral seconds. 

I would surprised measure effect accurately margin error study, I'm sure benefit REASONABLE use mouthwash slightly increased use mouthwash pandemics outbreaks spread people's mouths... most. 

Your mouth petri dish viruses bacteria tend damage larger numbers. almost basic physics, knock pathogens numbers odds increase establish itself. virus might survive mouth grow also get lungs stomach risk, good practical many diseases keep mouth hole clean. We've gone lets test cases go saying fuck it, highest part far. It’s simple that. see parents coming think could little different. 

The extended period social distancing mask wearing hard kids, child particular hard time isolation. understand mother wants “normal” playtime. lot misinformation floating around mom way believes risking anyone’s health (even don’t agree).

And fully onboard mask wearing social distancing, don’t agree dads approach either. grandparents spending 2-3 days time living close quarters child, cloth mask not, exposed brings corona. Making everyone wear mask around time seems traumatic me. hard child. grandparents high risk don’t want risk (totally understandable) safe option distance child over.

It’s black white situation. child needs parents. needs page. going one extreme healthy kids mental health. point, parents sacrifice personal need 50/50 time best kid I'm scared. Im probably going lose someone love pandemic. can't take that. think 2020 far go  download data Germany. need spreadsheet simple models.

Off cause need make assumptions, making model, know assumptions make difference reality.

You easily spot already saw current wave. think thousands extra deaths better Great Depression 2 one won’t get while. I’ve also corona virus maybe help me? shit get worse riots continue. like Kenosha, WI place work STILL boarded ""until release verdict officer charged with"". starting dark time get work soon time leave work. basically get zero sun 5 days week. supposedly, man passed away got placebo. wife. person tests positive reasonable assume spouse least exposed probably positive well. many sociologists pointed out, Swedish people different patterns socialising living worst affected areas Europe. Things like greetings, personal space, living arrangements (i.e. high percentage population living alone) significant impact. Notably though, Sweden significantly worse Scandinavian neighbours. Tú mismo, rey. la suda. confirm herd mentality spreading thru Mormon church Utah. bunch also recommending people get tested, use herbal remedies like elder berries. asinine. March 242, 2020 What’s sad still 3% US population confirmed cases. can't even get Task Manager open tables wheels! thought US rushing T***ps vaccine FDA comprised? April? think world needs yesterday. indentured servitude? murica need lockdown? biden initiate one? NiCe Try CoVId GoeS away elecTiOn Yes looking since reopened schools  asked make sacrifice sticking yellow ribbon car versus wearing mask would gotten better participation rate EU hardly fiscal capacity cover normal budget covid, definitely cover continent -wide surge financial fallout. something genetic makeup/history compels us defend personal liberty extreme possible form. 

Personal liberty/freedom speech coveted most, even threat death itself. People saying folks gonna ""move ladder"" naive. There'll nowhere folks go, good housing land bought Chinese people.

And point fingers say I'm racist, I'm Chinese. I've seen friends family pointlessly buying houses rent out. I've seen happen Hong Kong, Japan, here. joe biden initiate country wide lockdown becomes president? thoughts this. Believe not, never Loving, NV. guess ""by April"" includes days then, starting tomorrow.

For UK least tentative plans vaccinate at-risk groups year, imagine EU similar ideas even discussing openly. problem people (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, etc.) determine ""misinformation"" financial political agendas benefited deeming anything like ""misinformation"". That's happens lock everyone inside months..... people think vaccine politicized US look EU/Canada. looking vaccines!!! Starting think US right thing, everybody got virus couple million dead (note population growth year still positive despite additional deaths, children born people dying) people likely immune able restart economy sooner others. rest world crash economies seconds wave, third, maybe fourth vaccine spread enough. Congratulations.... People actually thinking way prevent COVID-19 spreading lost. got countries game over, EXCEPTIONS. Look Europe right now, specifically Italy. Italy one restrictive lockdowns world cases time high. lockdown countries, sooner later resources run out, people's savings start deplete, unemployment rise exponentially. force countries open back inevitable spread. people screaming ""iF LoCkEd cOuNtrY CoViD wOuLd ConTainED"" fucking delusional. way completely prevent spread upending world economies prolonged periods time going solve damn thing.

You downvote me, echo chamber sub thinking clear solution need educate intricacies world's situation. much this.  even activate N95 manufacturing capability have. put big orders decided pandemic over. could basically go back normal distributed monthly supplies N95's everyone mandated people wear them. give time. It’s also economy. hate talk economy important part. social creatures culture gatherings almost important us food. We’ve diet bread water socially it’s good us. 

So yes jobs important even unlimited resources unemployed people would still want, need, things open gatherings happen. time people advocate reforming WHO.

WHO supposed organization people trust, political nature leaders, become place incompetent leaders simply inexperienced people play people's lives. 

There urgent need revamp organization every countries world walked organizations once. agree said, unclear whether 6.87 vs 5 fold change statistically significant. Could still within error margin. 

Absolutely... exactly point? would suggest percentage people testing positive April would roughly percentage people testing positive now, number tests performed categories people.

So, would *not* support claim much worse April now.

Don't get wrong, believe second wave bad first (yet?) point numbers definitively state April worse simply Also, number people going ICU Sweden increased proportionally number cases (I know lot factors play though). 

Absolutely. far Sweden done much better job keeping virus elder care facilities hit hard first time round.

My concern rules introduced stop spread infection elder care facilities seemingly relaxed right worst possible moment - second wave hits.

Treatments better, demographic hit younger, fairly strict rules place eventually brought first wave end. arrogance FHM believing much better everyone else leading make mistakes causing much trouble countries - relaxing rules situation clearly calls opposite. Indian here, joe biden announce lockdown becomes president?? wanted. Whether viruses considered living really depends opinion. boundary “life”; scientists consider alive, don’t. nearly 20,000 peak first wave halfway there. mean, private people put money aside hard times companies go business 1 month income? Maybe companies stop wasting money Starbucks... Yea also beat Vietnam war.

Seriously american delusion wrong always superior (exceptionalism) , exactly US self imploding itself.

 US seeing situation clearly head far clouds.

China Russia even need lift finger , US Trump already destroying collapsing weight. 

There Americans killed COVID , thus indirectly poor US response modern wars combined. Victoria went far ban protesting, even protestors agreed wear mask socially distance. Heck, even solitary protests banned. went full totalitarian enforce lockdown. it? seem line assistant executive secretary Urgency Emergency Care, Moab Amorim, Manaus, 3% 4% infected new coronavirus type sequel. 

IMO shows large size infection vs hospital capacity (as point out).

Also maybe severe covid worse consequences later seems suspected. Okay, everyone jumps ""duh"" train...


I work hospital *highly* frustrating messaging company basically ""as long wear mask spend 15 minutes within 6 feet positive patient, impossible infected."" company would us believe we're actually *lower* risk general population, long get covid going bars restaurants off-hours.

So even though seems obvious, nice see printed proof hospital staff higher risk. (Now would get hazard pay free frequent testing without symptoms) Lockdowns help temporarily. Countries need get really serious mask wearing, offering free imposing fines wearing also crack large gatherings. Despite focus US, lot European countries pretty lax mask wearing, governments still saying anything they're pointless. search ""walking tours {european / uk city}"" within past several months Youtube see lot people streets without masks on. 

Indoor places need mandated temp checks customers entering limited capacity, anyone coughing frequently needs kicked asap need open doors windows fans blowing indoor air towards outside. Workers cannot allowed walk around mask around neck nose fully exposed. 

I think measures, cases drop back need lock down. People resist like US given facts done alternatives like full lock downs, think people accept always resisting want everything go back normal think mortality rate high enough warrant mitigation efforts (or think ""hoax"" altogether). think you’re mixing respirator ventilator Jeezus, $1,250 pop even work.

I want give benefit doubt nothing crooked going on, way things going, likely crooked. Yes do! sad thing...we live world. Many people close eyes ignore bad things cma feel better lives. die. end  Housing market insane right now, stuff barely market 2 weeks city 200K. 

It weird.  I'm stuck behind paywall here, I'm going go ahead assume lot involves schools universities back session. live near u eastern Michigan, schools cities depend students function. Ann Arbor especially, Ann Arbor would probably go broke without football. students U stay home orders, reason, football team's still playing. lot major cities major universities here, lansings got MSU, Kalamazoo WMU, Grand Rapids GVSU, upper peninsulas got northern, Marquette, I'm sure others. Every bit prevention tried do, naught started cramming people dorms. implies 20% cases severe? stage game, personally see vaccine til summer 2021. Plus, inoculating nearly 8 billion people (which close 50% Americans say they'll refuse even get) quite feat manage. opinion matter? could provide arguments wrong squeezing little brain instead comment. open discussion. Eh, depends. know 3 healthcare workers gotten since beginning. global partner nurse working COVID patients recently family flip trying ‘poison’ sick mother drugs giving her. claimed since mom breathing issues already hospital lying COVID. day one days Trump quipped something numbers made up. never seen partner come home angry. scared. Sensible. Get back someone know gets infected seriously ill. 

There “we” POV. behavior, like 45’s, ultimately selfish. minority dorms passing SARS CoV 2 feces could asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptoms recognize Covid19, hiding milder cases avoid social sanction.

Among positive nasopharangeal rtPCR tests, [about 20% remain throughout infection. 16 billion....that's double population world. Yeah think makes sense. 

My thought weeks we'll probably see Boris come say something like ""We clearance Vaccine released December frontline workers vulnerable. However, beginning th end must react keep virus vaccine biggest impact"". 

In this, people say ""well utterly shit, three/four weeks knowing they're roll vaccine last lockdown"". also see nice economic bounce back, people willing spend Christmas, jobs slightly secure businesses able plan January onwards. 

There stick approach earlier - big fine, big fear, tell neighbour. go carrot time - Christmas family guaranteed get ""X"" hospital occupancy rate there's vaccine come, hold tight light end tunnel. UK cases rising quickly EU countries seems. UK WELL ahead Italy Germany seem catching UK even overtaking (in Italy's case).

R must lower uk EU nations. Can't pandemic there's one left die **'not even close'** 

We know. author article either daft misinformed. Obviously understand sick people succumb death time.... joke journalist. example hired first place. Obviously that's going happen. begining. Absolutely delusional say otherwise. real hero Let's hear story. Yeah real number cases spring waaaay higher recorded due lack testing. basically dying get test feb/March/april many people outside CO don’t know TABOR handcuffs puts Polis in. Thank you.

For info: schools open? That's main drivers. crack? Lock September 2021? 

Pay mortgage , pay property taxes, pay assist kindergartener virtual “learning.” well talk, even considering damage done kids socialization. 

Otherwise detached reality extremely privileged comment like straight face. Bro end means getting cure, thats beat it.. Trumps right We’ll couple weeks. Hospitals slammed. Prevented long, months, year? Let's kid 4000 deaths. 99,9% would probably died within year without covid. Sweden excess mortality full year far know.

Of course individual tragedies strictly talk numbers need present complete picture. time act, Sweden. window opportunity closing soon. Follow neighbours time. that's proper way lockdown quarantine. Sweden vs. Europe since september 11th (date article 52,000 French cases equal 256,000 US cases. US shithole think people don’t really realise much France dropped ball here. US might lacking action, terms situation surging anywhere near like France. people DGAF. Oh man, even ""bad"" pandemic

People DGAF 'bad' pandemic. Everybody supplementing Vitamin anyway. Unless live Florida *and* work outside every day job... likely deficient greater-or-lesser degree. 

And live anywhere Northern US actively supplementing Vitamin D, foolish. literally pennies day supplement, critical nutrient, downsides deficiency numerous. Assuming trust everyone quarantine

That's problem. can't. can't possibly keep tabs everyone takes one person exposed get whole family sick. Peruano Boliviano here. 

Proud see mom's nation mentioned sad see context. Peru never true lockdown. could Bolivia truly so. 


Most Peruvians Lima depend daily marketplaces informal economy service sector, lockdown never cards. main purpose lockdown anyway, help create time good plans next phase limited, targeted reopenings. Lol. It’s belief. fact. cost denials Americans deaths hundreds thousands. non-stop parties now. Shit, see friends parties, club, brunching. People care. I’m fine like. Doesn’t mean it’s ok dick it. Belgium Mar 18th-Sep 29th 
Covid Deaths reported: 9,975 vs. Excess Deaths: 11,327 huge amazing question ask someone could provide answer would great. 

Is evidence causality registered, noticed occurrences sudden deaths (heart attacks, asthma patience dying suddenly...) corona virus? I'm noticing eerie deaths locally reported news sites country. Healthy individuals dropping dead heart attacks. 

Yesterday high school student asthma collapsed died, also yesterday middle aged woman collapsed walking street instantly dead. Today middle aged man heart attack, sportsman last decade trainer, last night training team today dead. Maybe looking much everything happening really strange. 

It pattern per se strange enough tickle curiosity. know corona virus causes clots was, well individuals symptoms. 

Is possible asymptomatic individuals affected way, somehow corona virus working behind scenes, behind T-cells immune system? Texas - i.e., Covid central moment - schools open, want send year bother online learning, pretty poor quality.

Homeschooling intimidate - homeschooled many years well - can't replace social aspect. Thank goodness kids other. Well maybe governments spent last 7 months rapidly building new hospitals. answer lock down, increase capacity. North Dakota #1 covid cases(per capita) while. mask mandate. governor insists people need make right choice LOL  Yup severe immuno response. Sure mate. Keep believing Republicans wasteful spending honestly idea pushing soooo hard. parents mid-late 60's+.

Really? Maybe might another holiday season them? really can't figure brain she'd want family together holidays? Really? Well caravan illegal immigrants disappeared right last elections Leading Doctors live (Germany) claiming focus individual responsibility refrain introducing second government-mandated lockdown.

At time clearly see exponential trend (doubling time 10 days) number ICU beds needed Covid patients, weeks exponential growth case numbers.

If number ICU patients double another two times (\~3 weeks current rate), ICUs close capacity.

Not sure leading doctors want put colleagues nurses ICUs traumatic experience. Saturday 60 minute interview playing cases, still blaming cases testing little wishy-washy masks. (He eventually got irritated asked masks said something along lines of, ""I support masks"".. quite song dance around it).

All fine say, ""hey, protect neighbors. mask go out"" look like ass. Reporters quip, ""why take long endorse masks"" smirk wink carry always supported masks. confident thought. angry make throwaway account like everyone else exact time last year read 1984. Watching nation slide authoritarian dystopia complete mind fuck. general acceptance shit morons polies overall country done right thing. NZ, would feeling outrageously smug incredibly sad friends families rest world failed miserably leadership. famous forgotten deadly second wave spanish flu... 
Why hell people talking April second wave would worse, summer everyone forgot it, even competent governments Hopefully we're taking care getting office shortly. We'll keep updated. rate decrease eventually. Unfortunately appears run healthy people infect instead stopping vaccinating. USA! USA! USA! ugh called personal responsibility. friend texas got it, least 4 people household, none ever got tested. symptoms there. even took breathing treatments times. (her dad machine) many people even gotten tested lifted many restrictions and/or people tired restriction currently place. It’s simple that. wouldn’t throw shade us, US is, like March, couple weeks behind us. Eventually they’re going run people report... what? Yup there’s asymptomatic group, group people wont bother getting test know what’s point, denial dismissing rationalizing symptoms, vile group parents pacts quarantine get kids tested order keep numbers low prevent school shutting down. 

This seriously underreported OP talked vaccines general specify timeframes development guy try intimidate CarMax asked wearing mask ""masks mandatory"" signs store. wife one point said ""Don't worry, election"" seconds later ""We've already Covid really worry getting sick, that's works."" 

So morons think hoax also covid...

WTF Russia, 17k new cases: getting control, need stricter measures. 

USA, 75k new cases: fine. $750 installation ""fee""  probably. real lockdown. allowed leave apartments food brief exercise weeks, fuck lockdown? almost went fucking insane trapped alone tiny apartment. least conservatives liberals want Swedes die. liberals prove point Covid, conservatives prove point socialism. still less obscene administration actually PPE fear — 5% Wisconsin’s population Florida Arizona 3 weeks now. 6 months, bring back sun rest us pale obese (hopefully alive) simpletons. Thank providing this. trump administration claimed defeat COVID wouldn’t make fake news hoax... again? daughter 2.5 communication skills lacking :( definitely behind, friend 19m old doctor told put daycare around kids helps lot Im like... pandemic WHAT.. ?? That's risky omg. daughter seen kid age like 3 times since March. 

I want cry, literally one day day out. Perfect timing spin Biden's fault. Costco Walmart exist Germany. become comedian, cause great joke! 😆

Look definition sycophant, think means think does. far self indulgent, everyone America? Though, kinda seems like projecting. Perhaps hoping Covid spike would suppress voter turnout amongst Dems much conscientious pandemic.

And, comes. Right schedule. country everyone freaked seeing 1000 cases day not, compared countries. never wear masks streets, always free move outside (e.g. go walks without ulterior motive like exercise walking dog) never curfew. countries least measures, them.  Yeah, isn’t debt works. US debt used safety blanket prevent massive wars America. want wage war America? Okay, great, way, debt? aren’t paying since don’t deal business enemy. country would stupid. Y’all ok? pretty much driving road someone crosses line head collision. There's nothing move forward time escape what's going happen.

I've thought alot. There's nothing short living completely grid. honestly surprised sometime life ended wrong side firing squad US pop 5x france gets 11,000% international flights. Fractions still taught school right? imagine it’s correlation people seeking flew shots right also people likely engage risky behavior properly protect need to. You’ve got problems. asked said dig post history. seek help. Alright guys time go back school right? know children *famous* keeping germs themselves! Belgium [counted deaths countries consider related that's numbers high. time REAL communism? Sorry cracked enough eggs (i.e. bodies). truly awful! sorry. can’t repeat questions. I’d like answer them. don’t understand you’re asking. state emergency Katastrophenschutzgesetze state level that; Notstandsgesetz 1968 never used, would allow fed govt override Länder declaration ""inner threat"". doubt go far, would really consequences. Half! lol! small business owner, find optimism adorable. fact, much Reddit’s hate, lot rampant France. edgy. Bud expenses skyrocketed.. would love burn one w boys. Solo seshs making feel like crack head Correction: never national lockdown US plan sight. foot fetish anything normal, guro understandable foot fetish Apparently quoting actual title article. one panic attack mask quite thick. time simply switched paper mask, limit breathing all. breathing problems time. people ridiculous. Yeah, party trying suppress pronouns, it’s one accepts he/she. forgot ""arbetsgivaravgift"", (employer contribution?). salaries companies must pay around 30 SEK 100 SEK salaries. reserved future pensions big chunk pure tax.

We also high VAT normally 25%. (25% added, 20% included). Per link, Sweden 5918 deaths Denmark 709.

Compare per capita basis, exactly said. Life pretty much back normal China. Bars, restaurants, clubs open even local cases would've easily spread now. roughly United States adjusted population. surprising since share misleader Okay, since even state emergency Katastrophenschutzgesetze state level that; far know Notstandsgesetz 1968 never used. would allow Bundesregierung override Länder declaration ""inner threat"". doubt go far, would really consequences. Similar same. Clearly differences. We’re number one baby!!! Wooooooo NY, went nearby gym first time since ... last march ?

quite experience, might last while, first hard breathe mask cardio + lifting weights. deter taking off, shortened work (that working 6 months) stations disinfectant spray towels would use using equipment.

HOWEVER many young people hopping freely machine machine without sanitizing properly. gross disgusting, going cancel pause membership

on positive note LOSE 40 lbs since May NOTHING quitting drinking alcohol drinking water heavily daily binge eating bed time. tobacco THC levels increased mainly due stress working sleeping small room since March. flat earth again. ""It NASA"". Ok, 72 government space agencies? mean, easy poke mountain sized holes arguments, far rabbit hole, cognitive dissonance reduction. boom, enlightend everyone else sheep. ""A White House Office Science Technology""

Ahh good ol Scientology people! People arent always given choice. everyone else around unsafe, makes unsafe. Many people cannot quarantine essential workers. 

It's like forced room people, idiots blindfolded randomly firing handgun whatever direction feel like. guess personal responsibility get hit. soon 95% population vaccinated party time. fuck? definitely tough her. came know lot people really well. I'm looking forward day someone helm government isnt complete lunatic actively trying kill Americans score political points rabid base. Absolutely. get covid, they'll data helps said supposedly don’t remember hearing official channel. last time heard news articles unnamed source. changed stand corrected. enough transmissions first wave able that. Dogs may fast detecting COVID suddenly sourcing training tens thousands additional dogs addition retraining existing dogs fast. 1/3 America blindly accepts pandemic over. Hell large portion believe ever real first place. one party tearing statues trying write figures history?

I don’t remember party tearing statues trying write figures history. remember party going democratic process voting removing statues historical figures committed atrocities replacing historical figures everyone proud though. Please provide source party tearing statues writing figures history. Unless course, hyperbole. one party wanted make illegal speak mind didn’t fit agenda? 

Source? party see violating constitutional rights party you’re effectively one party tried outlaw certain pronouns?

Source? hyperbole? Redefining words, extent

Patriot Act, USA Freedom Act "" restaurants, bars, cinemas, theaters leisure facilities"" schools, may set 2nd wave, everywhere, public transport etc. single measure going get back reasonable control. government dithering accomplish wave worse 1st. They're market eye balls. need people pay attention, willing cost. get people scared even leave home check news constantly. Gotta get advertising dollars.

Are actually going pretend media general agenda? CNN pushes Covid fear part anti-Trump stance. Fox News opposite. trying get people side watch get dollars. Lol, that’s literally original message replied was!! literally millions BinaxNow tests sent state-by-state basis week alone. reason average person like can't get one distributed people need like frontline workers, schools, nursing homes, etc.  They've massively scale production incredibly short amount time, yet they've already managed produce tens millions Imagine much could reduced UBI. Screw fraud fauci! Fucking hack “Death sentence” Wow sensationalize much? work media? Since less half percent fatality rate death sentence? regardless, what’s answer then? parents that, don’t know, need funny stuff called money? go bankrupt? Lose home? Starve? What’s solution? Oh make comments flu killed teachers? Americans killed COVID , thus indirectly poor US response ,than modern wars combined.

22 y/o GI != 82 y/o nursing home victim. 

I'm supporting Trump. I'd see tried incompetence command, stood wall, shot rags. 

Still like comparison though. used [Worldometers make quick comparison 7-day moving averages daily new cases daily deaths, overlaid account ~1 month lag them. Can't say I'm optimistic heading insufficient data recommend either use vitamin prevention treatment COVID-19.

Zero public health officials US promoting vitamin D. Meanwhile, Remdesivir standard treatment here. statement NIH silly since massive amounts data related vitamin Covid Remdesivir data bad...but still making standard care.

Just go live phantasy movie brain made feel cozy politicians highly political public health officials spend time trying make life better corruption exists third world banana republics. stupid take. worries. still talk. Get local infections universal masking public places. Yes saying farewell bars dining restaurants rest economy get back work. target relief help companies model isn’t compatible masks. wonder population density, mass transit ridership, factors here? 

Belgium deaths/million really quite high Aside dex, there's actually evidence true. Every treatment shown nothing. 

Doesn't necessarily mean that. remember Spring doctors talking learned lot already.

At start thing giving patient liquids that's lot diseases.But causing kidney failures stopped it. 

Stuff like better treatment. Doctors know virus. thing Europe. Teens young 15 make medical decisions there. USA sadly backward treatment young. ""Wearing mask personal choice""

K... also personal choice walk around shooting wildly air. personal choice drive speed limit. personal choice pay leaving store something took shelf.

What fuck Hope realizes war would significantly worse Bruh moment Hello, please familiarize sub’s rules. Edited titles allowed. Sweden doint? America greater sum parts, parts great. bet ever said rounding corner must feel pretty foolish Yea know Absolutely true, side effect lockdown, like saw Italy's lockdown, people country take virus ultimately increasing global spread. *laughs American*


Unfortunately know hospitals asked staff work even positive asymptomatic. Thankfully stopped practice as, oddly enough, multiple outbreaks kept happening. could seen coming? 


/s last sentence case one got sarcastic question. mesh ones super breathable remember news site ran story much it'll cost world prevent next pandemic quoted super high number

then realized less 2% total US military budget upvoted title alone. Nobody thinks within month o_o least hope personally think 5-6 months time get approved vaccine we'll mostly back normal need national lockdown interstate travel ban. Bill know you. claim know intentions. likewise fashion same. 

I see spend awful lot time playing video games. I’d imagine area expertise virtual world, one rooted reality. Escapism. that’s perfectly ok. Yet would argue such, blind poorly situation handled. see given choice two bad outcomes (as presented Covid), one must rely PRINCIPLES fall back them. society drifting away principles. Namely republic protection individual liberty held priority number one.

Out Bill, real world, cure causing pain illness. it’s high time start admitting it. It’s okay change ones mind presented new evidence. beginning lot unknowns scared made lot decisions time seems holding steadfastly to, stubbornly, even though learning more. 

When model revised, weren’t policies?

Best wishes Bill. I’m hating Falcons... bruh, time. lol. Also, word ""pandemic""... country ""end"" pandemic. That's like ending winter ending oceans Tbh numbers france pretty abysmal lately. Per capita, currently new infections per day US. (It‘s sad „worse US“ completely damning thing say now, almost par „worse North Korea“.) Thank u💕 also doesn’t help mental health provider shortage quite time. don’t resources deal effects. would hard-pressed blame one thing though. Many people like blame lockdowns, don’t think persistent threat life-threatening disease excess death toll causing many people unexpectedly lose loved ones year aren’t also contributing factors got nothing you. like another perfect storm brewed part short-sightedness 2020 feels need capitalize on. doubt that... get fake vaccine get covid thinking they're immune, it'll even worse states saw too. actually happened yet, expected soon. think he’s correct don’t want listen? *Emigrate Belgium outlier model eventually happen Euro nations? wasn’t colonizing good old raiding. That’s lockdown failing work- that’s failure implement lockdown successfully Tiers. Don’t forget Tiers. know hornbook pulled from, no.

If think First Amendment allows government punish sincerely held belief expressed speaker (as opposed fraud, perjury swatting (wtf?)) simply state thinks belief incorrect harmful, there's nothing else say you. right called 1p-LSD talking regular LSD. there’s huge push science get media make people aware going huge resurgence virus people look like magical fairy dust. Expectations need reigned perpetuating idea “within month” everything back normal great idea.


You specifically spreading around “Fauci said” XYZ, based “conservative” outlooks great. certainly See know that. believe government caring minorities, poc, poor, etc benefits them. truly believe struggles others result lack willpower diverting resources people takes away them. completely wrong, can’t won’t see end work money healthcare.

Sometimes still don’t see go GOP said going hurt thought get hurt please help me. realizing help never coming.

It’s pure selfishness ignorance. Sometimes even malevolency. Yeah totally look commented holy. bad mental back February checking kinda stopped. Last heard 120 obviously weeks ago. things many places world though. everywhere, true, examples don’t show America exceptional. 

Liberty freedom inherent restraint act without harm others, fact someone allowed anti-mask example freedom liberty. simply selfish individualism valued social responsibility, America delusional liberty. point talk lockdowns. Maybe misinterpreted biased lockdowns. It’s easy people well support it’s unfair people aren’t. hate government deeming business essential not, think end creating even negatives road covid could

Edit: say France’s government probably better job taking care people aren’t well idea. guess I’m coming article US lockdowns went mind way, thank you!  Yes absolutely right, wanted mention many extensions.
I still fear earlier curfew ""week-end lockdown"". would awful, still go work, that's it.. Ah okay get mean. That's valid concern. Pop Pop! He's going win. According polls, Fat boy struggling get lead Texas fucking places. may still get narrow victory, still, Texas confirmed victory telling chances next week. Obviously, chances good. record number people voting year get fat ass here. chance. living world. Huh, TIL.

I'm Brit Bush stuff really picked pop culture references days. Trump rare get American politics shoved throats, last 4 years irksome. #nomoreyears Don’t let distract fact COVID blew 28-3 lead Grocery stores going shut down, water going turn off. lucky enough job remote simply disappear there's shutdown, main concern get bored loved one gets Covid. prepare getting loved ones take distancing isolation seriously, maybe get Switch something. kindle/e-reader wait books ship. 

If job kind goes away lock down, let's hope stimulus package. would half teams get covid? Proper lockdowns convince people do, know country would stupid refuse lockdown not, bother listen reporting literally amounts cases yesterday, therefore over. Zero analysis whatsoever. vaccine way end, keep mind even vaccine effective limited time, people get boosters (like diseases) greatly slow spread. always post archive link people read it. check papers subscribe think high quality. FWIW can’t post Boston Globe it’s hard paywall.

Edit here’s link again:[archive link anyone trouble accessing article Fair enough. quite accurately personifies negative stereotype U.S. (warmongering money-obsessed nationalistic arrogance regard environment global cooperation) many people Europe decades. surprised widespread acceptance extremist. TOP pick leader unite 300 million people!? man worse Berlusconi! hard getting people continue wear mask 2 weeks vaccine. longer. till everyone vaccinated least enough herd immunity take over. places also starting ration care based age &amp; preexisting conditions

Nobody's actually yet, they? problem once, people respecting social distancing proper mask wearing grandma happy see neighbors. people different, piece shows tough time many. ""white house science office"" 

Isn't oxymoron? tried taking meal? Also might want take antacid (like tums)- want careful overdo tums. Sure thing, Pollyanna. thing people, mix conspiratorial bullshit fact. going giving medical advice despite qualified questioned say ""oh, doctors know much anyway"". moron.

I seen single doctor claim taking vitamin supplements. advice moment make sure vitamin levels adequate (and always advice).

The fact touting sort miracle cure another thing altogether.


I live America doubt Remdesivir effective. already done study confirmed next useless. special knowing that, secret. People can't handle stress would rather put heads sand... basically. here's thing, that's originally thought. However, wish kidding, honestly believe disease going to.....vanish election. Why? that's Trump taught believe would politely recommend watch less brainwashing media. people wearing masks today wearing need to, virus eradicated becomes significantly less threat expect masks stop used widespread. would say 2019-like normal coming back around mid-late 2021, people want normal life back doubt people live like much longer. Liberty! people wore masks took seriously would fewer shorter lockdowns. Instead we've got hodgepodge half measures people running around screaming concerned wellbeing others endless pandemic. Leonard likes vaccine still trials. didn’t say anything hasn’t said million times already alive begin cannot die.

There even clear scientific consensus whether alive not, beside point anyway. virus leaves someone's body lands surface, ""alive"" still capable infecting human touches said surface. certain amount time depending species virus, ""die"" longer capable infecting human.

We argue day whether viruses actually alive not, basic knowledge ""die,"" whatever want call it, left without virus never go away say ""die off""

Based saying feel need clarify I'm talking *individual viruses*, entire species virus. thought clear, idk need explain it. People don’t want president say they’ll do, want president Say!  don’t watch news it’s actually pretty fine there. Pandemic 2.0 Yeah dad complaining can't make minds keep changing rules. Uhhhhh yeah learn new info change handle things. welcome you. test first thanks. US: Hold (Corona-)beer! people actually believe public's view towards virus change new President. Yeah that's Trump desperate pump needed boomer votes could destroyed stocks got wiped out. guess Republicans playing burn house blame Democrats thing. Life 100% mortality rate. always going something “kill us” there. setting disturbing precedent.... trust covid another another another. won’t stop. “Majority rules doesn’t work mental institutions.” really depends vaccine fast get 150M people dosed. said may available sense know works produce it. Actually producing distributing massive quantities gonna new challenge. Maybe afraid COVID-19 go back in-person classes isn’t bad reason recover within week. Canadian glad border US remains largely closed. point, perhaps indirectly. natural people downplay information counter experiences. experience may need change understand seriousness pandemic. 

More people become responsible people friends family fallen ill died. people stop saying pandemic real, know people lost loved one. Another half-arsed measure aimed protecting economy. He’s got it, joking didn’t resonate. Hahah YES! Go read book, jumping jacks, anything get head while. holiday yeah... Gaining citizenship little harder. held belief

Lol. understand correctly strict lockdown back March right? Seems mainly hospitality industry forced close non essential retail still open schools still open know delete social media don’t watch TV it’s actually bad? People public generally pretty nice. Most. shitshow right now. Next week going interesting. comment history eye opening. mom told yesterday believe people like existed. sent screenshots. exist scary. definitely noticed Form fatigue. People took sorts precautions seriously early summer. weeks ago town, every bar restaurant full. People simply got tired. malicious, everyone rationalizations could celebrate events, visit family, take short vacation.

Even within family none tough measures ask them.

People relaxed much. change points dropped. Except Beale pension today nobody i'm curious, dad get information? 

deaths stagnated. wait another 6-8 weeks better idea effects current surges. quote Zootopia?

No, not. Considering job *just* made masks mandatory today(in NY btw), no, haven’t required precautions place. mass people going go

Warm(er) places homeless. actually example someone finally realizing situation inside brainwashing

Exactly this. I'm France. first lockdown gave us respite 5 months deaths. saved tens thousands lives stopping exponential increase contaminations tracks. people dying virus barely circulating. get months respite lockdown, might get saved vaccine. That's hope anyway. Lockdowns work, can't prevent future new waves. in......Tell us something know. Also, every new headline, make sure include something positive it. world needs change wants. Especially lacking much needed leadership. happened Bezos wealth ? Sweden cases Denmark? maybe need alcohol, heard disinfectant. blame politicians want... end personal decision make personal responsibility get us quickly safely possible.

If politicize that, problem. politicians. takes fool idiot fall that.

Don't plague rat. Yeah virus sure knows petty. Rural areas... Mask usage...

I hate say it, never get people take even sliver precaution. one enforces EOs, cops give 0 fucks, people think BS. ever bored go Facebook page governor KY see daily cases reaching time highs here. Treatments vastly improved. remdesivir plasma don’t seem much, steroids, blood thinners, oxygen management changed ton hospitalized mortality rates dropped 70%. (Both recent study NYU also hospital NY work treating covid patients.) Tell opioid addict.

But serious note, course know subjected potentially life-altering medication profits large corporation problematic range reasons even minors parents want help world.  desire isnt actually people die, thats means end. desire people take seriously.

That doesnt make bad person. normal brainstorm solutions problems. countries? workplace remote since March, infinite wisdom they're deciding open November. Ohio. long people figure Covid-19 never go away entirely? Everyone inevitably face fact living post pandemic society. That's concerning heart rate. need real medical advice, reddit comments. Please contact medical professional right away. weird Europe best healthcare entire world highest HDI rating among countries world yet numbers coming would expect 2nd 3rd world country.

What could underlying reason? High population density? Popular tourist hotspots? attitude among Europeans? 

Whatever hope things get better fast! Wishing Europeans best! agree restrictions may introduced certain cases, rigid ‘stay home order’ style lockdown completely table point it’s obvious far destructive virus could ever dream being. 

I specifically referring funding, France paying people. America, people want lockdowns bad fun make sourdough bread. Expecting people stop earning family without subsidy honestly insane behavior. article situation heartbreaking. solution keeps people safe without conpletely isolating everyone love. Covid tests available free low cost, could protocols developed could allow folks test negative visit family members also negative? understand athletes wearing masks, supposed hinder performance. microwave home. breaks heart hear. wish peace healing. Thank telling story. forced mothers give birth alone likewise parents grandparents forced pass alone. can’t think two greater assaults human experience. proof x mean proof x. use emprerical data. 7 months pandemic, reinfections still quite rare. So, good assume reinfection primary concern.

And btw, problem researching T-cells that, methods detect much costly. way less research done them, compared T-cells Hungary free everyone, shortage 2 days lmao. funny country full antivax idiots whenever give free vaccine they'll go doctor asap Kids definitely need immune systems “primed.” don’t think socially isolated ideal reason. People thinking Trump singlehandedly could fix absurd. Europe posting even cases (including per capita) significant mask use stricter lockdowns. 

This horse barn people. end COVID even close, war lost.

The US overrun shortly, there's nothing stop now. probably 10 times infections cases right now, US clearly exponential rocket ship along axis. whatever happened free market, cant survive die. capitalism no? soon fires Fauci wins?  need Federal mandate, supposed disappeared Easter. There's immunity antibodies. Memory cells hold onto immunity ramp antibodies virus detected again. 


Herd immunity varies virus, estimates one 80% less. Measles 90% ridiculously high R0 score. 


I'm herd immunity approach record. serious argument heard lockdowns. think good argument lockdowns though ignoring virus catastrophic. *“We’ve locked older adults rooms name safety without thinking unintended consequences here,” Grabowski said. “In many respects, side effects worse potential harm slightly higher risk infection.”* 

&amp;#x200B;

Holy fuck, imagine Trump said this? takes week go diagnosis hospital admission 10 days go diagnosis death. Doubling time 9-12 days average.  That’s never going happen. gain that? Needless fearmongering spooks market, ultimately makes loose money. go court, hope court documents public information.  
We every right know bad apples among us. And? anything closure buisnesses? USA situation **the choice** politicians. parties focused strategy winning (or weird cultish ideology) care actually passing stimulus. created system cares mega corporations, everybody else coming understand kind society means rest us must live in. kiss dead bodies??? what??? Meanwhile, 'murica, Churchill's Principle applies: ""You expect Americans right thing.... tried everything else.""

We tried everything else yet. option going back, mandatory I've heard, many people elected go back. virus endemic US now, probably. That’s one way end pandemic. New Zealand mandatory 2 week quarantine. COVID, U.S. elections, uncertain personal/professional future, I'm straight good time. This. It’s learning process. 

I NYC tail end January. travel bans taking effect, fact. Came home, sick cold within week. next week flu. trouble breathing (I’m risk annually pneumonia), went urgent care, berated asking Covid. “Have China? No? WAY novel Coronavirus! No.” 

Now retrospect they’re wondering it. second paragraph article says “it could end 2021 see semblance normalcy - normalcy means going theatre restaurants operating almost full capacity”.

This headline trash. ...does anyone truly care? no. take draconian measures get control. people understand care, know COVID cases piling up, deaths lack available beds hospitals. Misleading headline. Sounds like fauci anticipates gradual shift normal mid next year completely normal little year 

Quote:

“I think easily end 2021 perhaps next year start semblance normality.


""If normal means get people theatre without worrying call congregate-setting super infections, get restaurants open almost full capacity,"" added.” Yeah go court tomorrow. New Zealand. Asian countries ostracized falling line general society confiditoned since birth. course work together choice lives “Wear mask” callous COVID-denialism, now. Mkay. Amen hopefully die next one (either natural causes underwater cunning linguist accident) [Faucis entire talk anyone interested That's sad I'm sorry grandmother.

I understand hard, imagine someones grandmother died covid precautions put place senior facility. I'm sure person would upset.

This rock hard place. Unfortunately good solutions fit needs everyone.

I sorry grandmother though. sounds horrible. idea lockdowns masks feel good measures It’s def gonna Long Night. seems rather pointless enforcement carried post-shutdown given still be, minimum, months vaccine rolled out. Even death standard metric across board make comparison meaningful. know vaccines trials now, especially mRNA based vaccines? mimic shortlived bump circulating antibodies caused actual virus last longer? Lady local Facebook group yelling people bad, ""9 members family survived obviously big deal, flu, vitamin c soup fix it""

She arguing nurse worked covid unit nurse wrong stupid support local restrictions implace..... We're number 1! We're number one! We're number one! throws shit wall see anything sticks. Biden would simultaneously shut country down, destroying country, would also nothing, killing 2 million people. Anyone brain would recognize obvious bullshit. 40% country happy slurp half want hear.  What’s expertise handling global pandemics? well australia looked like europe state country. new conditions require new responses. think many reasons wont happen, election least important factor, else far behind every country since late 80s Imagine access type testing regimes used NFL/NBA could safely mitigate human costs associated social distancing. 

It seems answers consider either lockdown fully open. months get better solution. scientific data supports masks, yet people ignoring Germany. ? Qatar actually, estimated 0.4% chances reinfection, memory working fine. think easily end 2021 perhaps next year start *some semblance* normality

Is trying get people give listening something? 

Honesty good there’s balance saying saying way doesn’t fatigue everyone caring anymore. If, spite distancing, masks, lockdowns, flu killed quarter million Americans 9 months we'd treat differently. Could lack cases due fact they’re island, hopped science super early? They’re interesting case Australians socially concerned welfare communities? guess that’s hard measure. Also amount research going could help future diseases Sorry don’t want economy shut this, many people’s lives ruined continue widespread lockdowns, people going lose jobs, homes, everything bullshit. It’s don’t care people getting it, rather it’s care people don’t hunker virus won’t die from. People die flu every year, I’m comparing flu people going die yes it’s unfortunate sad happening cant shut everything down. hell man, looking jump-start economy something? also look forward time. best ❤️  I'll curious still feel way Biden wins, Dems take control Congress, still meaningful relief bill passed. blame then? Ok kicks looked [overall death rate CDC says 723.6 deaths per 100,000 people 2018. multiply five there'd 3618 deaths per 500k normal mortality rates. that's whole year, portion sick covid-19. Where'd get numbers say 10x that? individuals first SARS outbreak 17 years ago measurable cell immunity. Definitely something people worried about.  teach elementary school aged kids things changed.  half want youtubers professional fortnite players Didnt report anything u lil snowflake comment remember his?  

Because (who raised notion) seemed think big deal. letting know people. think funny sub shouts ""It's flu bro"" 100 times thread compares flu every chance gets. virus problem, people scared hiding away. economy important, deaths disease. economy truly tanks find why. would love see flu viruses. Thanks dude comment cured depression Potatoes risk becoming French Fries, Centers Potatoes says. un-realistic timeline? Nah getting end November beginning december! 

Cuz Trump.

USA#1 Lockdowns won’t work unless government supporting people financially. whatever reason US government didn’t figure think that’s people opposed first place. Minnesotan here, see say that. However know lot older barfly's inclined go bar/venue. everything else shut down, pretty much skiing/snowboarding/skating. active participate activities social distance, less active likely resort less distanced/heated places. mean 2.5% mortality rate? grateful people can't math nobody would leave house fauci says still first wave verifies verifier?! Answer that! *You've given nothing anecdotes far* even argued people *with links sources...*

I also see compared country locking borders ""being North Korea"" bunch recent comments...  shut fuck hit us *your* sources, fucking hypocrite?  formal gouvernement begin October. sad many people completely dark this. know watched cable news station, Foxnews, seems encourage people gung ho this. Gin flavored cloves...no check. parties 17 suck anyway, ain't missing  doesn’t understand whole thing. I’m giving him. Read link Tegnell’s actual comments understand ""Weed escape family. makes tolerable."" I'm curious make post Feb, Biden takes office Dems control congress, still pass meaningful relief bill, suddenly they're concerned national debt, they're still distracted Trump throwing temper tantrum. WTH? MLB gonna let superspreading event go without sanctions idiot team? people get successful mainly luck.

The trope man given wants pretend hasn't. Working hard include actual work done, includes working toward profession desirable courts high value. Migrant workers settle meager wages, work easily repeatable (don't confuse work attractive, simply one it) done almost anyone else, hard work payoff instance. However, worker saving attend college vocational program job desirable, valuable easily replaced, longer luck true hard work result high chance successful outcome. similar flu. 

There 6 strains (L, V, G, GH, GR S)

Will vaccine work currently? likely (if that's pressed hear say?) 

Will 1 time thing (no) potentially point vaccines different across boarders? Maybe. depends strains mutate GH/GR mostly north American based L/V Asian based. We're totally capacity everywhere hospitals can't keep up. like ol' Donnie got entire hospital could dedicate resources one patient. Trump loses period early Nov late Jan ignore Corona, even blame ""fraud Covid"" loss Tack! don’t need find sources. trust you. didn’t know it’s different. saw difference might big thought: Denmark 18 ICU 15 respirator. almost everyone danish ICU needs respirator point. Fatigue? Go talk Australians. severe lock down, unable leave 5km radius house. numbers infection much lower Canada even though similar population. matter covid seasonal vaccine takes long roll Really? It’s totally line what’s happening. saying (implying saying) Sweden significantly smaller 2nd wave countries. doesn’t seem true. spread obviously operates different time frames different places. contention it’s order magnitude European countries. it’s exact average Europe. (Though it’s still technically order mag well need quibble.). death Sweden’s infection rate popped later. Deaths soon follow unfortunately (hopefully almost certainly). It’s criminal share something false. way beat misinformation better true information. truth prevails kind fuckwit worsening crisis. *They* may well fine, they'll spread people fine. months since started, still get that? Part job trace outbreaks US hospitals. 90 Houston, half year, crank ACs point can't leave house without coat either... ""Here South Dakota listen called experts.""

Kristi Noem Bc virus spread beyond people care. said flatten curve mean flatten vertically. sad, beginning stripped things used do, hang friends, go eat, see movies. felt obligation slow spread.

This. many us help control spread. cant solved bottom up. administration failed country.  ""Freedom speech"" bro. US concept free speech funny, country this. even UK speech laws. wonder free speech laws US really intended let rich powerful control views society letting avg person voice. interesting Midwest outbreak dies down. that, almost every area US would experienced massive outbreak (save places like Colorado Vermont). I’m saying anything herd immunity, hopefully enough sereoprevelancy areas massive outbreaks behind us. Yes, causing strokes heart issues young people: 

Even back March doctors noticing big increase heart attacks would allow Bundesregierung override Länder declaration ""inner threat"".

Yeah Bundesrat sacks it. REVOLT :( They’ll string people along, making harder plan respond necessary impact thus increasing push back.

No one wants hear two months making sound better almost certainly comes back bite everyone. Meanwhile nobody remember name. Unfortunately, DXM great nature. That’s objectively wrong Denmark gold standard comes testing. think it’s difficult make 1:1 comparison positivity rate countries since Denmark tests much more. Sweden’s rate cases low 1% Denmark 0,25%. 

Sweden’s lag deaths usually 2-3 weeks usually it’s 90% done 2 weeks. Denmark’s deaths marginally higher per capita pretty much go back week 38 forward. course. imply need Vitamin masks unnecessary. firm proponent mask usage reasonable social distancing. public health officials cared health, would promoting measures shown effective. Mask usage showing reduce cases half. That's great, enough own. addition trying limit spread, advocating measures strengthen peoples' bodies disease come contact virus. I'd rather people asymptomatic mild disease rather progressing serious disease requiring hospitalization, ICU, even progressing death. immunomodulating compounds cheap widely available shown impact Vitamin Zinc significant ones. costs us nothing....other Big Pharm potential windfalls...it risks forgoing that...won't someone please think pharm CEOs? People complaining coronavirus subreddit != good representation what’s actually happening, though. restaurants operating full capacity? people restaurants attending pre-covid levels? people complaining inflating occupancy due tuned-in covid threats? 

Has place wild community spread, effectively federal assistance/mitigation efforts, open indoor dining, *and* suffered severe economic downturn? There’s basically escaping economic effects covid *unless* curb community spread. Death rate way according CDC. Take look ACTUAL DEATH rate chart. mainly media hype. 73,200 new cases Tuesday, according updated data Johns Hopkins University. past seven days, 503,000 new nearly 1,000 coronavirus deaths Tuesday, week, data we're right middle what's going referred ... mother outbreaks last hundred years,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, longtime director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said discussion Yale Institute Global Health. It’s amount spread vs countries. vs spring seems odd try predict end based case count. real bottom line vaccine shows up, unless intending shoot heard immunity. moron media cannot seem figure either, perhaps want fear ruining agenda. - way realistically lockdown. cannot tell businesses (e.g. restaurants, bars, gyms etc.) close financially support them. people supposed live cannot work (and get paid)? government NEEDS cover large part lost income. people enough money buy food pay rent, get riots. surprised situation US, exactly ""cannot pay rent"" happening right government seem care. No. third party vote vote Covid, tens thousands unnecessary deaths, incompetent supply chain management, incompetent vaccine distribution, herd ""mentality."" totally agree think cost clearly worth right now. Maybe personal since spoke parents, really think irresponsible. Mutti &lt;3 Thank goddess live sane state relatives friends take seriously (since immunocompromised treatment autoimmune disorder, friends family thoughtful informed certain health issues like least 10 years since diagnosed. blessed people care enough that)

I'm Vermont take pretty seriously here. go grocery store, everyone masked properly, distancing, workers sanitizing POS customers offering sanitizer several places store. discipline seems order childish ""the world revolves around me"" attitude permeates top clearly understand article saying since actually backs point. U Kansas study statistical study follows quantitative methods practices provides evidence favor mask usage. original posting guy pulling numbers air support pre determined view point. missing point entirely. taking person classes pandemic. enforce masks distancing them. would waste time something unlikely happen? isn’t system set up. Vote suspect might happen election, say trump loses, he’ll go seriously insane dominate news cycle point COVID news diluted severely. people easily take whole thing going away. Never mind right wing media playing even harder. Ah yes haha sorry did. said order magnitude countries Europe. mean. Still need look order magnitude btw. That's Biden's problem. soon takes office we'll get plethora ""covid-19 cases national debt higher ever Biden"" April start Spring, weather likely played much role virus cases suddenly dropping lockdowns did.

Now conditions spreading better virus, we'll see ramping place. would never stab someone 27 times something petty.

So saying angry enough someone harm them, like e.g. caught raping child, carefully stop plan many times stab them?

Or would start poking holes stop stopped moving? celebration Rose Garden? think lot people have. happens every time--the usernames. wonder trolls paid. coping? I’m high risk despite finally starting break isolation alittle. can’t keep up. Honestly surprised little hurt. b12 shot tetanus shot last winter hurt way more. everyone who's afraid pain, basically non-existent. it! Here's latest case/death charts Arkansas, running 7-day 60.82 deaths per 100k population, ranking 20th per capita way. Exactly Assuming 1% accurate, realize 1% American population would 3 million people? 

Just go away. I’m sick selfish bullshit. hear you. think tough one. 99.7 survival rate Trump afraid use DPA. companies retooled N95s disappeared summer like hoping, would negatively impacted bottom lines companies make expensive changes period time short cover cost profit. much hopefulness enough seriousness, really. KN95s hit miss, KF94s trustworthy. forget eyewear. Eyes much vector contraction nose mouth.  think get 70% Sales revenue Nov 2019, take delivery still permitted  Ok then. Yeah. Realistically get short term lockdown truly work well could need advance notice, need get people monetary assistance time able get food medicine need able shelter place much possible, ideally something like free netflix, internet caps, fancy movie schedule broadcast TV.

Harry Potter week, Star wars week after, two weeks marvel movies two day shit. Good thing vaccine mere months, weeks away Genius hope something special 500,000th case, like coupon free vaccine something. We've got celebrate milestones. I'm sure i've read ways, worse less severe second infection. country's people become weak  Saw guy store recently wearing mask, even tho supposed to. leg literally almost size waist.  think lot people think wont happen them. I'm high risk still try cautious Seriously. Stay home won’t wear mask. people go malls/restaurants air conditioning, basically spreading virus place work reality. people think government job stop virus follow precaution. care freedom mere lockdown.  I'm confused... day saw post claimed Fauci said vaccine available end November. many click bait posts sense smell intact unlikely given symptoms. kinda get vibe people torn. We're stoked idea lockdown, people seriously financially suffering industries. Bt time people want get others sick. bit shit really. Yes downvote much like.
Today 15th day since first measures bars restaurants put place. cases going down?
Because schools. Authoritarian praising authoritarian measures. surprising. Forgive me. stand corrected. States. situation much much different delivered media likely. States described saw above, cannot speak geographical area though. Apologies. reason shipping tests center Utah instead running onsite, tests morning would get results night. idea way. Apparently, tested positive inconclusive test Monday Tuesday test expedited found positive middle game. Well, there's one symptom worry about! certainly shown side America fully realize existed. stops enough public opposed measures. end day politicians calling shots. 

This likely end politically ends medically. would less need lockdowns people wore masks took seriously tried spread pandemic. people running around without masks screaming injustice concerned well-being others causing spikes mean longer frequent lock downs. meme. agree you. Realistically things won’t starting get back normal 2022. get saying, logic free international market cannot used sustain regimes violate basic human rights. Furthermore, economic effects popular coup debatable. cause effect phenomenon, otherwise Bolivia would disrupted now, case. going direction likely embrace authoritarian regimes compatible free market. corporations cease relations w/ China, example? course not. Matter fact, rupture Trump government may attract market even more. geopolitcal core world already changing, way. Take look dependency theory elaborated brilliant economists. Shouldn’t place since March...? state allowed fans football games. cases rises seem easing restrictions instead increasing again. Macron 37% approval handing Virus lol Howard Beale’s somehow still incredibly relevant 44 years. people incapable caring anything affects directly.

I’m sure vision collapse is. Probably different mine. 

My anger frustration it’s avoidable controllable. people get infected expect healthcare workers bail out. ...and people deserve get, whether life long chronic illness death. note protests days people business affected new measures. anti mask protests.

What Yes, give time Pooh Narcissistic stupid? Europe crashing. fucking election? I’m damned tired dumbasses. Vatican 33666? (no deaths though) ourselfs. restrictions worked pretty good summer, weather change variable broke resilience system. adjusted way earlier dynamic. hope learn lot make good decisions rest winter. US 8-10 weeks delays death certificates last time checked CDC website. Operation Warp Speed probably one positive things he's done crisis. Correct. want even picky mention things VAT all.

Cause am. full national lockdown March extended nationally. question time? find hour. know we're kind lockdown, dont know look like. thing, long remains extremely underpaid position, teachers US often people ""ended teachers"" rather people ""educated teachers"". Making viable career option goes long way towards ensuring capable people perform professions. That'd however mean investing human potential long term gain instead handing kids electronic toys look good upcoming elections know gonna happen. Every wave COVID trigger massive layoff. Shit going hit fan. One county’s head Republican Party died Covid weeks ago well. That’s it. Don’t wait you’ve lost complete control like France. Nip bud early.  Lower Germany: 1month lockdown beginning next monday. Way move goalposts. Please defend original statement rather talking something totally different, please. one said ever mutated, mutations might make effective spreading. 

You made statement vaccines working various strains called ""common sense"", yet can't produce anything. I've read paper cited depth, back claim, merely says continue watch spike protein changes check changes changes vaccine efficacy, common sense. I'm noting everyone gets hit exactly time.

You desperately trying find something good Swedish situation, nothing good. think need act like big deal people blame trump better chance getting elected. way florida governor thinks tourists come things full steam ahead. informed voters like foreign tourists buying it. weather nothing population density holidays do.

I'm gonna hazard guess say experienced Nordic winter before. weather absolutely plays it, makes people go indoors, know spreads much better indoors. Also vitamin levels drop like stone sun sets 1530.  Pretty old population , really high density teammates. teammates wives, kids, family, congratulating hugs kisses. manager sat next ripping mask like Hogan used rip shirts off. manager cancer survivor. consider endemic now, lol bit googling, 1918 Pandemic flared early spring, second wave summer, third wave winter finally declared summer 1919. Seems pretty similar current trajectory face things. basically like diet. Yeah lose weight immediately drastic caloric deficit, need eat reasonably afterwards maintain it. Many countries proper maintenance, pretend diets work, justifying reluctance implement them. Yes I’m aware that. Different different countries though. Germany, Denmark lots testing spring would caught more. testing capability similar across Europe im sure people catching higher % now. still all. spread part regarding Sweden vs countries 2nd wave. vs. spring getting hit SARS times, yes figured health security politics ego. supposed go away...like magic. want see magic please. falsely yelling fire theater protected speech, neither falsely yelling all-clear pandemic. Stop dumb Wasn’t even real season lmao. many people give shit. half team gets sick lot remember name though. It’s understandable, point. Unfortunately lockdown it’s either nothing. Either everyone (or least majority) follow rules lockdown becomes ineffective get negative effects lockdown + viral resurgence top.

Many people don’t understand they’re contributing problems this. taking seriously increases likelihood needing lockdown first place, bringing negative consequences regardless.

This pandemic tragedy human nature working itself. millions corona cases worldwide handful confirmed reinfections? I'll take odds anyday. Oof Somewhat indicative US Covid response things CDC spends time doing. Surely logistical plan distribute vaccines assistance tracing quarantine efforts would better spend time. feel better flair correct? World series champion slash ignorant, selfish piece human trash.

Time kick out, Mother thinks shopping Home Goods important lives, needs go. going it, need announce day before. begins Monday next week people UK hit pubs facilities spread it. Then, lasts longer 2 weeks first two weeks lockdown un-doing damage announcing early 

I really hope advise home office people possible too. partner back office covid hotspot Germany boss covid skeptic send people home office unless told to. trains getting busy cases rising...home office possible company know still offices. US never stopped fucked... kept riding along deaths. Yes! precise reason lockdowns Europe failed... strict enough, *long* enough.

Ideally, lockdowns done effective treatments vaccines available general public. 18 months total, March 2020 September 2021. 

However, feasible, especially republics like European countries. means must especially careful reimpose restrictions whenever cases, hospitalizations, deaths certain point. Sort like ""circuit breaker"" (the *exact* term Wales Scotland using second lockdowns - good them!). 

Just like Neil Ferguson said early on! moment restrictions lifted, cases came soaring again. Sometimes sooner, sometimes later, eventually, did. guess one wanted listen him, he's pessimistic. always bad thing? realistic! everybody put blinders, refused listen him... eventually discover right all! people rejected message. hated Ferguson told truth. they'll surely never interact people photo taken. may end beginning. 1. Scientists doctors advise government act policies take.

2. Government takes implements policies.

3. people trust government scientists doctors right thing , comply. matter health security.

Its really easy remove politics _every single little thing_ life US west general.

I mean Germany also approach response.

It's really complicated. guys try sometimes. FAKE / SCAM!!!

Already posted yesterday, removed creator post five minutes later. Ireland introduced level 5 restrictions (highest level restrictions-essentially lockdown) week half ago moderate (level 3-indoor dining ban, ban gatherings 6 people etc) restrictions two weeks that, first country Europe , West European country dropping cases 10 19 cases BNO News tracked full details known, second infection produced worse symptoms first, five instances produced serious illness. Australia's economy nowhere near good America's, yet got $2,400 month every month since April. less 30,000 cases entire pandemic. maybe change needed usher time better teachers? education system US terrible recently maybe takes kind upheaval finally court higher paychecks thus better teachers work force. People still taking seriously, like Eastern Europe. Question: Australians see Trump rallies TV? broadcasted there? people get successful mainly luck. work hard still dirt poor. see every day passing farms seeing migrants working fields hours day getting paid less me. guy went game, pulled mask knowingly exposed teammates, coaches *and families*. purpose, prioritizing celebration health.

Justin Turner America's COVID response nutshell. Sure, wanted professional athlete 10, never thought heroes. true? source this? definition different? Denmark say example: 50 ICU 24 respirator. That’s interesting. Redefining words happened happening. Look never ending debate pronouns, gender, sex, biology, it’s changing. Racism too, seems definition changed years yeah know never wound using it, feeling especially paranoid yesterday. i’m afraid getting point. Australian sun joke, visited friends Melbourne spring one year got fierce sunburn legs *through jeans* car ride coast. rest trip put slop whole body every day clothes. i'm French go one week ago hotel lobby work, choice. mask. 4 people, 30-40 years old, already there, talking loudly phone, watching netflix hours there, mask. get lost : lockdown partly you, guys. hope happy ""outsider"" Don’t backs hurt moving goalposts much? happens doesn’t go away? moving next? stables *a horses dozens have* bolted... Hmm thought provoking. read article... know why? Hope recovers quickly. Good luck. even close'

I think even needed expert tell that. that, know need contact with? Winning World Series huge deal. think completely touch reality. Maybe circle chubby reddit kids play video games big deal, lot people matters. rushing vaccine doses people? China must substantial stockpile now? deep state wants believe masks work it’s drive herd immunity threshold! people like Europe worst outbreak ever  wonder 4 years research cut normal vaccines fast track considered shortcut. Sorry, can't edit mods remove post. Wasn’t early rumor similar AIDS. full effect virus immune system might evident immediately? WINNING!! El Paso - Juarez deep trouble. Well you’re smart case. idiot American can’t even speak one language know would assume someone else can’t speak English. shit hole from?  don’t care election. get end 2020. That’s I’ve hoping for. nation brain washed people completely divided along partisan propaganda What’s mask wearing like Belgium? Sweden vit behind, everything suggests heading similar second wave everyone, bit later. Haha season over, money made, don’t care sounds like sensationalism. It'll easy contract trace case quarantine everybody involved. teammates would probably make choice including 99% time - championship lifetime accomplishment guys. isn’t get someone pregnant start spike. Definitely rounded corner.. last corner never rounded seen. 😭😭 Congrats successful troll. Pretty damn blatant too. people would wear masks would self-isolate symptoms, economy would continue remarkably normally.

But won't. people concerns eat restaurants, avoid shopping person, want get virus.

The time buy, better treat virus likely vaccine place everyone gets COVID-19.

The thing? There's strong evidence getting COVID-19 give long-term immunity. first case might mild, second might kill you. third. ignore go away /s know thing American themed that's standard go response anything else say? Why? literally right now. Unemployed since early year steel place worked laid basically everybody off. (I already laid Christmas, supposed brought back late January. Got news happening shortly after.) Unemployment benefits ran last week. luckily enough savings get months bills, come end November could royally, utterly fucked. Also savings wedding never intended use this. 

Thing is, I've applying jobs whole time. Nobody area hiring, tons people know lucky enough still working lost half hours, everyone else know struggling regardless. friends/family owned businesses throwing table hours periodically, would completely boned. I've holding stimulus last 5 months could least scrape every month work comes in. Meanwhile trumpster mom STILL blames pelosi everything probably still voting trump. real example gop extortion people. feels hopeless. wish anyone. knowing survive week week something nobody deserves. certainly doesn't. calculating CFR instead IFR. test inconclusive night game results last night's tests come back middle game.

Yeah, first test inconclusive lower statistics.  TLDR:

No news, agenda-pushing.  Literally said ""the HI government sent QR code scan arrive.""

Showed video. Jansen better ERA 2020 2019. Theory. Opinion maybe? fact. Would fact request directive. not. Thus proof, random internet quarterback theories US unable work together circumstance.  important health department said switched weekend new, automated system allows new cases added count quickly. said change accounted 1,500 3,369 cases reported since Monday, even cases factored out, state record rolling seven-day average. restrictions justified. End. Of. Story. yes would mask mandate. Im government wants suggest wearing one. Fact matter majority people accept risks like telling do. risks nearly close bad initially thought chance recovery close 100%. Hospitalizations needed extreme cases danger capacity. heard argument back March hospitals lay doctors nurses everything covid patients refused hospitals nearly empty. Read sources believe me. I’m making implications anecdotes bud, I’m using disprove things say absolute certainty. 

Corona isn’t contagious less 1% population gotten countries, family know got it. outside transmission rare, much like surface surface transmission.

See: protests/riots causing spikes give fuck? 

Do still wear mask around people, avoid elderly, work home, wash hands, avoid crowded places? Also yes

Theres much coulda shoulda woulda posts. Naive. need learn accept fact people fucking dumber shit incompetent fuck. use fact plan accordingly. 

We probably deserve shit so. Whatever. think youre something actually.

1)Keeping people alive usually good coronalympics good old people riskgroup.

2)The UN measures quality life. Sweden scores high spent lot resources making sure old people live active, social life lot personal freedom. coronalympics free social life obviously bad.

3) Sweden highest numbers straff elderlycare. Obviusly bad beacuse straff means people infect old. literally raging like child hours thread. Misanthropy hell drug. Go back upper middle class white housing live ivory tower bubble  turned five year old corrects people proper mask wearing sees one nose chin. said verbatim ""wear mask keep six feet away! hard.""

It's seriously easy enough four year old understand. difference reality. Sweden removed restriction never place lot European countries. people could visit elderly restriction removed, outdoors. 

But yeah. virus makes way elderly care homes, must shut hard again. Like really hard. take big toll well-being many elderly care homes relatives. 

The information FHM around visiting ban removed: ""They passing bill""
 ""Actually Republicans ones blocking it""
 ""Doesnt change point""
The double think staggering. full salary right? 2k/month? Good. give us stimulus till affects people spend money international tourists. disney laid many people

That's happened. 
*In light prolonged impact COVID-19 business, including limited capacity due physical distancing requirements continued uncertainty regarding duration pandemic -- exacerbated California State's unwillingness lift restrictions would allow Disneyland reopen -- made difficult decision begin process reducing workforce Parks, Experiences Products segment levels, kept non-working Cast Members furlough since April, paying healthcare benefits,"" D'Amaro's statement talking statewide mask mandates proactive measures limitations going keep exponential growth virus check.

Mask mandates place FL since March place even summer surge. governor's recent ruling prevented police arresting people wear masks counties jurisdictions kept orders place (with exception one county panhandle redneck wrong mentality claim florida's numbers went peak must good job. 

FL's numbers ""gone down"" since peak. I'll ask again: FL's hospital capacity due COVID 5%, much lower think be? goal mitigation slowing spread, much lower 5% be?   Yep, going virtual class Obviously vote Democrat. 

You saying probabilities though. 0% probability many people dying virus. economic collapse? Doubtful sure, fraction percent. already know economic risks. think people hoarded.

You fear mongering, promoting thought. 

You, like virtually everyone else sub seems idea difference IFR CFR. Google them. VAST majority cases gone untested. Especially spring testing almost non existant. Tens millions infected according seroprevelance surveys. CFR *is not* percentage people die catch virus. artifact largely defendant testing capacity. IFR, anywhere .2 .3 1%, percentage people die virus. dont know many it, range. depends shitload factors. know seroprevelance surveys WAY tested. caught via testing, CFR would several times lower. actually read studies notice IFR important one know lot North Dakotans they’re bright population. large portion population dumb, though. Like lacking basic skills question anything see media. know ask why, who's paying/funding/benefiting certain policies. Also, basic understanding science pretty appalling. media plays role, people definitely share huge portion responsibility. Young people thinking nothing bad ever happen them? I'm shocked. 

/s COVID-19? 0. Memory B cells producing antibodies important reinfection bacteria, whereas memory cells important reinfection viral illness. play important role, antibodies binding virally infected cells tag destruction, cells actually kill virally infected cells. do. science. example, current evidence suggests children genetic predisposition acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lack exposure germs early childhood cause common childhood illnesses contributing factor development said leukemia (the immune system Greaves challenged previous reports possible environmental causes, ionising radiation, electricity cables, electromagnetic waves human-made chemicals -- arguing none supported robust evidence major causes.

Instead, presented strong evidence 'delayed infection' theory cause ALL, early infection beneficial prime immune system, later infection absence earlier priming trigger leukemia.”

There also plenty research supports idea clean (by modern standards) possible contributing factor rise kinds allergies children.  Oh, shit, I'm planning trying emigrate US trump stays office. also might complete idiot. Yeah man cuz socialist european countries public transit access healthcare cesspools.  whole narrative lockdowns they'd snuff virus, Europe held example this. work. Lockdowns slow virus lockdown effect.  life continuous lockdown worth living. Would u rather civil war? dont think losing end well. citizen US. Im afraid result election. right fucking crazy  vaccines (for Spanish flu)

Seems advantage back compared hospital beds. Ah, another one ""if work 100% makes sense"" people. Arguments like people wear stupid masks. stays home day? can't go large gatherings can't travel. That's ""normal"", ""resembles normal"". staying home day going eat, that's man. ""permanent damage"" going going kill people surrounding forseable future? 

living people adapt end living normal least normail-ish lives, dead people... much. know answer question you’re still dying hill, truly special citizenship revoked. Good idea. cares hospitals full can’t get treated accident, heart attack whatever there’s capacity. 95th percentile would mean fatter 95 percent folks age, correct? half us *voted* guy, half us decided ""yeah, reasonable decision vote anti-vaxxer, can't hold them.""

Meaning approximately 100% US public finds kind leadership acceptable.  pandemic cause lockdowns?  You: lower half income concerned **most** economy.

Study: lower half income less likely want reopenings higher

Do understand definition word ""most.""? fact, ""most."" less 50% group, decreases compare higher income lower income respondents. asserted exact opposite. objectively wrong here. 

I'm also one said rich want open, lol. Please acquaint basics logic. fact wrong saying, ""The lower half **most**"" concerned imply majority rich concerned. good this. fact need rely troll logic reveals quality argument. long Dakotas top 5 Covid-19 cases? Rural America seeing first wave. Socialism definitely answer. Never said smart. low empathy, therefore don’t need burdened weird, overarching structural problems many others fill day day with. Don’t mad it. guys handle yourselves, right? 

Done now, realized I’ve almost cared conversation. vast majority people every single country following rules.

Deaths rising Sweden, cases meaningless statistic. country Europe implement lockdown second “lockdown” even they’re isn’t enough.

No, don't. fabrication hardcore lockdown fanatics use know Sweden ruins called sociopath.

I'd actually say sociopath. want businesses destroyed, want suicides rise, want countries go bankrupt, want small towns need tourism wither die, want public health spending collapse generation countries paying debt finance lockdowns. personally want get sick. It’s 2nd game that’s canceled. played 1st game already. clear, went bar much adhering restrictions. case 150 maskless students. distanced, masked, wiped down. Obviously 1% family facetious. know families *didn't* spread other, even house. Anecdotes anecdotes. foolishness reason we're still mess. assume know hundreds thousands died. damn give truly think masks much.

Why think this? think doctors N95s covid wards look cool?

Or argument really types masks people wear? answer yes give everyone effective masks N95s KF94s? There's alternate reality CDC offices China properly staffed, sent proper warnings apolitical people State Department, American scientific, diplomatic military/infrastructure power brought bear problem becoming public knowledge, never makes past small hotspots outside China. Empathy. need empathy. Unfortunately good chunk country made raging narcissists morons. baffles amount overlap group people also claim Christian.

We're going hear Christmas ""taken away"" next. want kill Grandma Christmas? that's kill Grandma Christmas. Unfortunately people damn dense literally going take relative dying Covid realize. ""Both sides ""Actually one side actively proposing feasible deals. side literally ignored ""But sides!"" People push becomes obviously necessary.

It would cheaper would saved lives made lockdown last month.

Post lockdown every area case need locked down. Otherwise need third general lockdown. went harsh lock Australia. tough. 

We’re opening again. Hold onto sanity. happened original ""nythro"" account? get banned? Wouldn’t mes copains? friends? Perhaps stop watching CNN bothers much. getting cheekier cheekier, swear...  also told months America ""shut like Europe"" (which many states did), everything would back normal like Europe.  Turns virus get bored go away. best slow bide time, try maintain semblance society meantime. fly? We've violated absolutely human rights tracing tracking.  Uh no, please don't.

The German reaction lockdown terrible - especially compared rest Europe - motivated rest Europe, good bad. Germany, nobody would ever react way late - economy.  Aliens Yes, that's need lockdown get cases level controllable.

I tried get daughter tested 5000 cases day, test infrastructure already saturated. That's summer build capacity. didn't.

I hope waste lockdown time, honestly think they'll thing again. correct cdc guidance states unprotected exposure min within 6 ft mask) must quarantine 14 days. Many people take days mount immune response. sister exposed tested negative day positive 5 days out. neither. saying wave pretty harmful way describe pandemic, implies people chill cases aren’t sky high. especially dangerous virus takes long show symptoms Apply asylum persecution due political beliefs, cause know Trump going loyalty purge wins. hate probably 100% right... People fucking stupid... resembles normal. mean normal. Half measures result half successes. worry, France literally banned social circles I'm sorry loss, added pain enduring uncle's ignorance. can't imagine. deserve deserve deserve it. hell spiteful stupid. know aren’t countries world? Long term effects Covid-19 unknown, agreed. far good.  exactly hear that. asking true. Oooo la dee da! Suprised lot count 5. Definitely lighter non essential retail shops closed. Christmas hard blow. Physical assault devalues point masks. I'm served country. I've volunteered deployment combat zones. I've sent cities middle self destruction call peaceful protests. would willing sacrifice. probability. 99.6% chance survival virus. 

I 99.6% chance survival going missions 16+ hours day 14-20 days row 1 day in-between. 99.6% chance survival training future mission. 

The restrictions virus brought upon country proven unconstitutional currently fought courts. currently multiple examples courts proving restrictions unconstitutional. right follow corrupt politicians orders, also right express myself, follow ridiculous mandates Doctors INCLUDING Dr Fauci gone back forth whether masks effective, necessarily, even helpful. week they're ""proven"" productive counter measure, knows change next week, even next month election. 

I advocating one presidential candidate other, suggesting virus real. I'm suggesting 200k drop bucket compared 2.2 million people Dr Fauci's model originally suggested back Mar/April. compare 200,000 327,000,000 people US, even global deaths reach 1,100,000 global population 7,800,000,000....I'll take odds day week. Ignorance localized. Harder take immediate talking points corporate propaganda. Considering half US population wear masks 2/3's get vaccine, I'll take over. immunity lasts less year, end permanent us believe science probably need vaccine every year. think worldwide it’s safe say lockdowns don’t really work right?

No. work give result give - much faster decline compared it.

That's get lockdown. people seem think lockdowns supposed eradicate virus face earth, can't that, go like ""they work!"" care rising infections  quick calculation:

Up 12th June, Sweden 50000 confirmed cases Covid-19.

If assume immunity gone 3-5 months, would claim, then:

From 12th September today, 30000 new cases confirmed, would mean average risk confirmed positive time 12/9 today 30000/10000000= 0,3%.

That means that, 50000 initial infections, supposing 3-5 month immunity, expect 0,3%\*50000=150 people least *know* they've reinfected. far 1 confirmed case.

I know threshold determining reinfection high, 150 people *confirmed* positive twice would least caused lot reporting.

Disclaimer: calculation considered even remotely scientific lol How? Pointless people going disobey every social distancing rules mask rules every chance possible. virus like mutate passes people?


edit - yes, yes vacation Phoenix frequently going soon. It’s seemed fine different 2010 recent years? 

You say people act ignorant, conclude media/internet day day interactions? find people great day day interactions. Definitely kinder people Phoenix Toronto. say people, mean you. Mystery solved. cases rising every state. R0 1 nearly every state. uncontrolled exponential growth nearly every state. math data show we'll nearly 100% infected valentines day exactly we're right now. need remain large gatherings/95% mask mandate phase country either 1. able control spread virus 2. death rate drops significantly. every state currently 30-60% mask usage infection rates going up, unless governments start enforcing masks, business operations, gatherings we're going continue trajectory mass death economic disaster. pretty obvious general population intend volunteer compassion willingly.  bit lighter still hard lockdown. can't go outside home non-essential activity basically. work well.

People less scared, there's increased amount skepticism, generally fed up.

Some people see masks good enough ignore lockdown especially regard familial get-together  German states mask obligation schools already. bet others forced follow soon. already gave up. tacitly accepted covid new reality live with.

This dangerous phase. Folks like me, little fear yet good long, really it. Lol think wearing masks France Germany etc shocking one it’s spreading right 'Let sacrifices begin' Scotland five. makes us two better England. Get right ye. Urban centres spread out. Yet. feel like lot places getting true second wave now. Case point would mayor Juarez. worked well first time    don’t think understand insulation works. point think urgent might even end paying it, imagine lol get it. issues bonds paying almost coupon. getting point bond yields keep inflation, presumably point yields go back kills value bonds themselves. pushing people take risk get rate return planned based historical tends longer apply. 10 years semblance normalcy returns. Outdoor recreation, low risk worst = Dangerous

In person school, moderate risk best = Safe

How make sense? need TOPIK level 5 get long term residency visa. easy functionally fluent, year two, easily assuming complete idiot. 

It's volunteer service takes longest, since need 50 hours per calendar year 3 straight calendar years order get points based long term residency visa (unless crazy high income make points), can't work harder get done faster, etc. Fuck Game Thrones season 8 IRL Hillary’s emails!  Lol likely can’t even pay rent month South Dakota Governor Kristi ""Covid Barbie' Noem busy crisscrossing country stumping Trump worry actually governing state crisis. put Press Releases word 'science' them, thinks magic incantation make disappear. bad preventable /s dont deny mitigation welcome, smell infected fart, mean inhaled dose virus?

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* serious study backing claims? course people getting virus work, school, commuting public transports... Oh MeRica, Looks right another day Merica I'd rather sharp lockdown (with government stepping providing assistance businesses close + employees can't go work), problem months.

If US locked harder nationwide, we'd probably curve Europe - is, would hundreds thousands, millions, fewer cases summer, thousands less deaths.

A single lockdown going ever solution, magic. demonstrably worked curtail virus countries used it. US come federal level - see happening inauguration earliest. think recent claims public health officials 'even vaccine end social distancing' going push people 'I'm done, I'll take chances' camp.

It me.

If case sacrificing another 3-6 months get normality, fine. people seem hell-bent re-shaping society whatever reason. I'm out. hardly anyone heeded them. live 16th Street Mall hordes maskless barbarians never stopped coming cough spread germs shopping dining out. Trump lost vote seeing handled pandemic. like presidents actually leaders. hundreds antibodies body raises response infection, many different antibody tests varying degrees specificity sensitivity. diffuse cloud information hard conclude anything now.

That's prevent 3rd wave could've prevented 2nd one. list, long there's lot screwed country. know reading 7 lines text chore, maybe answer. I've edited read nice chunks. last point particularly true Ireland. Currently, governments strategy withstand lockdown December bid ""save Christmas"", whatever hell that's supposed mean. Whether means pubs open, gatherings allowed nobody knows. people getting sick lack competence government has, mostly rules make sense all, they've displayed precisely zero effort drawing plan action current restrictions cease. mean c'mon, want people follow show sort plan, even approximate one. ya plus lack motivation...the first one worked little..why would second one make anymore difference?..people feel defeated everyone become politician start caring much peoples problems? live life you’ll find don’t need anxiety medication anymore. Lockdowns mandated election done. That’s virus suppressed. dont feel sorry bars allowing maskless morons establishment well social distancing. Theoretically it’s possible be-infected measles too, it’s like less 1% chance. 99% people contract measles immune life. Thanks, long time since writing out. Prepare tough times. look europe. europe probably far peak deaths todays infections seen statistics like 4 weeks. Certainly government wont harshly adress covid infections explode, deaths. Even biden elected, take ages get control let cases explode like many people seem act like covid tired it. think us might hit 200 000 cases foreseable future(if testing capacities would available). one thing certain humans generally underestimate expontential growth. Numbers seem exaggerated today normal soon.. Hard wear PPE feds steal state’s stockpile purchases. remember kind adjustment period. I'd try different brand. Maybe there's additive one using upsetting stomach. 

I use brand gelcaps.  tier system? Totally clueless Canadian [not IFR low resources help patients right now. everyone got 15 weeks, IFR would increase lot. would enough hospital space also current medications used would run pretty quickly. 

Though even went 5% IFR would still come close 40m deaths. read FB. say trick treating (Toronto)

They advising it. plenty people tick 'r treating shelling (me kids something else them) Hi, someone please tell whether playing basketball game outdoors okay? masks obviously, pretty close contact.

Edit: Thank replies. someone professional expertise could give definitive answer I’d appreciate it. It’s risk/probability far understand it. Understood. generally try limit spending can, foster support net (friends, family, partner) case help needed. 
As rent, guess proactive landlord, negotiate - there's nothing lose there. ""We're rounding turn, we're rounding corner. going away."" - Donald Trump, 10/23/2020 Walmart tried exist Germany, got trouble consumers found prices low enough, public found culture weird authorities found way tried treat workers illegal. zero sympathy them. sadness feel people get right thing since March healthcare workers surely pushed limits sick themselves. Fuck friends make money great overview! American imperialism force good? Fines meant stop everything drastically reduce infractions, know that. Worked Melbourne. essentially Covid free least America, people robust social lives teenage years school extracurricular activities. Peer-to-peer interaction crucial stage life part gaining independence one’s parents.

Even COVID, teens generation experiencing depression anxiety teens years ago. Many psychologists believe partly caused less in-person interaction peers screen time.

So anything stays open, schools levels. countries worse us right now.

Seriously... forget second speak education course important thing. right must guaranteed something sacrifice schools.

Now premise mind let's analyze situation. official data (at least last one released) reported cases school population double compared general population. Officially transmission schools accounts 3,5/3,8 % cases. transmission recreational activities accounts 4,2/4,5%.

So people get infected? answer is: house. biggest transmission happens family members.

Since unlikely virus entering apartments night crawling open windows infect people statistic actually stating obvious: every person infected somewhere (work, school, etc) infecting people living eating sleeping apartment.

Ok.

So let's look procedures. class 20 one kid gets sick. test kid result positive. happens now? others quarantined. Quarantine means 14 days stay home close contacts positive. since kids mostly asymptomatic far know might 5 kids covid. parents close contacts close contacts theory follow quarantine rules home: wear masks together, use different bathrooms, never stay closer 1 meter, allow contact designated room. Good luck 6 years old. Anyhow parents still free go work (actually to), go bars, shop, etc close contacts close contact. think, given transmission happens home, going happen?

Another example. dad goes work. someone tests positive. quarantined close contact. kid, close contact close contact must still go school. Remember kids mostly asymptomatic dad testing positive, might bot covid simply asymptomatic himself. high risk transmission family. think going happen?

Let's go little further. teenager drink pizza friends. gets covid. asymptomatic. point impossible even think test guy, even less apply kind qurantine. goes high school sitting 5 hours day, 6 days week 20 guys.
5 10 days grandfather father classmate feels sick tests positive covid. rest class quarantined. point potentially guys covid, already spreading families. family member, point, limitations movement feels sick gets swab. Assuming everyone responsible asks test instead thinking oh well cold let's still go work.

Now mind want know someone even remotely think schools offices general closed space 20+ people share air 5+ hours day deemed safe.

Because unless accurate rapid test performed every student entering school something contained. impossible.

Blaming someone gets coffee drinks beer open air ridicolous. basic science.  I'm moderate lockdown skeptic (defined someone think ""lockdown eradication"" viable strategy) agree hospitals nearly overrun, lockdown MUST happen prevent collapse health system reduce number hospitalizations (but again, eradicate virus).

I predicted back March long lockdowns heavy restrictions summer months would backfire Fall/Winter 2nd harsh lockdown mandated since citizens' compliance morale would crushed. 

If thought anti lockdown protests Spring/Summer already bad enough, wait people told X-Mas canceled cannot get together family risk heavy fines and/or imprisoment. Damn sub took turn. Used whatever methods stop virus. y'all give shit.  Eradicate, sense. reopen till have. wish we'd US. us living way since March, forced continue many can't bothered think anyone themselves. everyone write garbage essays paragraph spacing horrible sentence structure. 

If want someone read argument, make readable. whole paragraph basically 1 run sentence.  Florida taking necessary precautions flatten curve tho apart initial shut down. Also service economy mean tourists going come. huge layoffs industry going stay longer international tourists trust florida safe place visit matter much governor wants act like things business usual. open everything restrictions

You literally can't social distancing *and* operate 100% capacity. Broad lockdowns months. 

Remember: Lockdowns started hospitals overflowing. mean honestly outdoors done fairly safe. everyone stays disciplined close really different dining outside restaurant (I'm ultra covid conservative even done that).

I've done family gatherings outdoors past couple months, tables spaced other, masks eating. 1 person mask allowed inside home someone needs use bathroom etc. things done minimize risk still enjoying others company.

I'm northern NJ getting pretty cold already, Thanksgiving Christmas probably table us going way cold feasibly this. “Anyone doesn’t like America must Russian”

But ya, i’m politician, fuck would care peoples problems know, someone actually kept track happening schools, might better understanding thing spreading communities. 

Blows mind called “conservatives” radically reckless. Who’s say shit doesn’t get really bad winter? Wouldn’t wise plan? think France thought would lock again? though? hospital system collapse continues. Curious then, thoughts next year say another Stimulus passed almost certainty. Punting suppose? Ah, gotcha. It’s awhile. gotta spruce French. Well duh. Sure RemindMe! 15 weeks ""Is everyone infected? vaccine?"" little top that’s really feel..

I highly recommend tuning negativity worry less president is. happier. real easy.

Pass law giving every person 1k month. officer cites wearing mask public place, longer receive benefits next 3 months. quickly find Republicans wearing masks.

The cost money pales comparison cost covid. feel like must kind protection. Italy 250.000 cases first wave (Feb-Apr) 300.000 cases current wave (late Sep-until now), around 6 months apart. Still, hasn’t even 1 single case confirmed suspected reinfection. far know, none spreading virus.

The problem nobody knows anything. Everyone says ""it me"" blames everybody else.

But even though nobody spreading virus, virus spreading... Given poverty density India, think India didnt badly.

Fucking laughable disconnect reality. There's really need continue clear searching stance continue arguing. will. was, 1% countries populations would infected.

**Most countries implemented mitigation protocols strict strict United States.** friends entire family none kids felt 1 parent mild cold symptoms.

something something anecdote better anecdote. friend's whole family get contagious? Surely 1% family actually contracts virus. boss asshole provide documents sake making come work 

Which means he's personally putting neck line - held account false statement. many bosses know take personal risk? Lockdowns incredibly effective citizens follow mandates afterwards. Oh, can't speak friends family surroundings. know conservative people circles say repeatedly gets completely taken context purpose, example I've seen IRL walked around Target everyday claiming running errands.

**SO. MUCH. THIS.**

I go stores mission, like get fuck way. mean easy move clearly make sure closed businesses get money, stimulus checks, stop people fucking around without masks group settings.

We got one fucking check. People still going without masks. Businesses opening necessity making bad decisions. can/they to. 

That's I'm saying. Sounds like “White Savior complex” me. something surreal March/April, everyone collectively watching Tiger King making bread taking family walks puzzles getting first masks. work get control goal. They're trying eliminate.it. want hospitals overwhelmed.

Poor France. thing fucking sucks. I'm grateful NZ. Come vaccine! wasn't. America. one actually stopping people (physically) leaving homes. checkpoints streets police stopping folks. ""stay home order"" honor system. Dafuq. body cared

Ppl really need realize isn’t going away 2021 won’t “vaccine” wrote, work prevent hospitals overloaded. feel like perspective still framed end game Nazi Germany, Germany's descent fascism.

I'm also upset little guy getting screwed massive corporations consolidating wealth. think looking for. There’s mutation scenario people might wear masks forever. became endemic like common cold would probably continue wear mask, lot depends things can’t predict right (how ability treat improve, etc.)

But yeah there’s effective vaccine doubt significant portion population would wear mask seems he’s strong believer power positive affirmations. go bar walk work possibly cause harm me. That's okay whatever deem bad. Tell smallpox. Oh wait can‘t. It‘s gone.

Not viruses smallpox. Smallpox special animal reservoirs occasionally reintroduce back humans. Smallpox evolve mutate nearly quickly viruses. Smallpox transmission also different.

There's reason smallpox relatively easy eradicate, still flu, common cold(s), chickenpox, HIV. Covid going anywhere. likely become endemic occasionally pop small outbreaks like swine flu does. antidepressants, losing motivation, deprived vitamin equally lethal Covid-19... got it. it’ll like May travel around 100 km see friends family. Anecdotal, relevant. mean people vulnerable aren’t taking seriously cool. Nature run course lol.

It sucks people getting sick process actual mandate comes it’s gonna keep getting worse worse. jest (as time trust me) lot tips good idea gnarly situation really. Hurricane? Lots advice applies.

You’re still dead might able make things wee tad comfortable end. 

better need need have. Well, worked. rely bare minimum surgical masks. I'll wear walking around outside less crowded areas I'm going near crowd inside anything, I'm breaking p100 respirator, n95 masks. I'm professional, judging sims I've seen pandemic going last long time. Generally pandemics follow one three paths: 1 gets stamped quickly never makes news. 2 becomes massive threat, burns population killing many overwhelming medical capacity. 3 containment measures taken slow down. smolders, slowly moving population killing never overwhelming. third option take long time finally put embers, appear third path. **If** works well published that's real game-changer. chromatography simple organic compounds (come on, *acetone*...) likely super-cheap, cheap, fast test, even 100% accurate, would change everything. think shutdown right need. Maybe restrictions there, indoor dining/bars bit figure safety measures needed reduce risk factors there. (Is 6 feet tables? plexi people bar? sporting events yelling TV's? dinner drinks, 2hr time limit? etc.

And figure actually help people safer reduce R0. right, Covid taken seriously. I'm fan CNN... 'reports' Covid. There's editorializing leaning fear be.

I didn’t read article, smaller lockdowns France date national one ended May 11th. 

We curfews places, lockdown speak of. Bars closed places curfews, nightclubs never reopened. curfews might worked started in, say, September, case load low, would’ve entirely impossible enforce.  live Ireland, they're not. asking wrong question here.

Instead wondering ""when go back *old* normal"", try wondering ""what *new* normal look like, adapt lifestyle fit it?"" agree.....the Dr matter-of-fact it. surprised. always assumed masks would come (save 5% population so) vast majority vaccine. maybe I'm wrong, doubt guess. live rural New England probably 90% masks public places inside. Maybe 95%. Great. Thanks great contribution conversation. [Have look excess deaths expected 24 member countries [slight excess deaths. Republicans begin impeachment process Biden failure handle virus 🙄 mandated law kids might issues think students wear them. Besides, biggest issue actually transportation outside school? countries teleportation materialize students right chair school home? time things kind centered South (remember Texas Arizona everyone said would armageddon never really came).

And across whole country, daily deaths much lower 3 months ago. way news talking would think worse. person Korean descent, I've heard good things there. I'm also considering Vietnam. friends mine live China, rapid economic developments there, I'm it.

Still, fact I'm person (relative) means. I'm lucky even able consider moving countries. work Walmart, I'd estimate half customers wearing masks wrong, wearing one all. We've told confront people masks, precisely things like incident yesterday two sisters beat man &amp; stabbed repeatedly mask confrontation. HO want violent incidents stores, play nice mouth breathing idiots coming &amp; polluting air. go sports walk dog, stuff like that. yeah, lack social interactions big time. Especially second time single year literally month away shut follow mass testing. mean countries done successfully. We're busy arguing mask wearing supreme court justices instead coming solutions. “As Colorado’s colleges universities announce plans spring semester, students administrators looking back fall, first full school term since coronavirus pandemic started, hoping learn successes mistakes. 

Across nation — across Colorado — institutions fared better others. Monday, Colorado campus cases since pandemic began March — University Colorado Boulder, 1,806 — [pales 4,082 cases Clemson University Georgia, University Georgia’s 4,049 cases, 3,634 University Florida. Clemson University almost 20,000 students, University Georgia 30,000 students, University Florida almost 35,000 students. University Colorado Boulder 35,000 students year.

Larger colleges like CU Boulder expected cases, part due dorms group living situations like Greek houses, according Angie Paccione, executive director Colorado Department Higher Education. isn’t unique higher education; nursing homes, jails prisons sensitive hotbeds virus, due large part residents using shared amenities. 

“It predictable,” Paccione said. “Who wouldn’t know coming back campus, droves, would see cases? would astonishing cases.”

For many colleges, success hinged whether make best 2020’s cocktail health crisis, economic uncertainty renewed racial reckoning, according Paccione. would predictable behavior playing differently year. 

For example, college enrollment often goes economic downturns people seek retrain themselves, that’s case year.

“Nothing true form right now, agile, flexible, responsive needs students needs communities,” Paccione said.“ months according who? number vaccines currently announcing preliminary (positive) results stage 3 trials based 40,000+ people mean mass production starting soon.

And would argue extra precautions wearing masks public learning live means. everyone stuff open long numbers stay manageable. Facts. Let’s see happens election tone bit I'll embrace dead fucking body. I'm gonna let boomer politicians tell live life. Anyone could be

Kinda point. person I'm responding seems certain *not* asymptomatic carrier/spreader way knowing certain. Anyone could be. God bless tier system. That’s still 19% less risk worry then. Come would learn chinese experiences? know smarter germaphobes always exaggerate comes inf dis. /s CLOSE DAMN SCHOOLS. printing money like crazy, going Wall Street, unemployed. Yup. we're talking former, latter. Anecdotally, I'm youngest person office 29. rest 54+ years old oldest turned 71. 

I one wear mask. one socially distance. one spend ~~Veteran's~~ Labor(/Memorial) day weekend Ozarks partying up.

The problem surveys that, y'know, people lie. happens Covid takes entire staff? buddy's job shut operations one employee infected *all them*. 100%. Hard get 99% sales without staff... Thoughts prayers grandma. Thanks bill Basic human decency would allowing small businesses keep livelihoods instead handing silver platter Amazon Wal mart. Yeah! hope! Let's get die! Let's get with! first, boyo! take draconian measures get control.

Not necessary all. Take us Korea. completely control draconian measures. understand viruses work, 99%+ mask compliance rate, socially distance moderately well.

It's draconian require people wear masks they'll fined arrested. That's *normal* procedure dealing people endanger public health. Yes things always get worse March low worst. possibility going extremely slim yes anything happen. That's said, vaccine pandemic over

When say source? within last get covid get vaccine, tough luck

I covid mid-late February. still wear people keep shit

Some people never did. politicized people stopped listening Fauci. Honestly though, problem people insist putting risk. following health recommendations mean health recommendations clear. *How full lockdown already???*

Because Florida believes freedom important cowering fear virus 99.5% survival rate. Serious question - Would able make Texas like fence ?
EDIT rude - white house Trump slung never truly symbol inclusion opportunity. fact people seeing many lies good thing. Nothing really changed except awareness. agree 40 million way high.

But please note person talking situation hospital EMT systems completely overrun, would send death rate skyrocketing. confront glare maskholes. Yes. Proudly.

Most people encounter fucking idiots much seals deal proving point.

Thank you!

Country full people like you. Good luck schools opened. seems completely ignoring there's prevalence people wear masks regularly throughout Asia: poor air quality recognition wearer may ill (even common cold) wish pass others. Also misinterpretation. lenient lockdowns US absolutely necessary produced desired result: flattening curve new cases. Unfortunately people misconstrued flattening curve end (with help people misinterpreting WHO's position lockdowns) started disregarding less economically impactful restrictions like masks distancing. Trolls put much effort

No wonder. I'm saying things rile up; I'm man word, actually believe say. Yeah, fantasy world capitalists capitalist apologists, really simple. saying factories closed spring, remain open time around Face Revealing opposed covering got us first place  Sure, things would know internet media. I’m saying aren’t problems, wouldn’t like gauge magnitude problem eyes media/internet show you? 

Like job, savings, don’t get beat police, haven’t died seen anyone die get seriously ill virus (you’d probably think flu didn’t know), would know things big problems country? Sure, you’d see tent city, trust you’re volunteering nearby homeless shelter large problem life? Ah. went head. [The paradox go lockdown.. Stay strong buddy! mean, whole US ""knows"" someone hospitalized it. Idiot-in-Chief it, hospitalized it, still downplaying it. really think hope fellow Americans start taking seriously, least 40% country worships him. ""A brave new world"" 
""The new world order"" Normal life coming back soon matter gets elected "" get it"" point see avoid lockdown. numbers kind community spread closing bars 6pm sound like effective way stop spread. Masks work conjunction things...such strong national response lockdown/test/trace. Countries relied entirely masks distancing expecting huge surges. right one roots whole problem. health sector STACKING money expense everyone. Inflated numbers grants. Millions taxpayer money research. LOT money moving around right virus fronting all. anticipate cost ~10 billion euro. 

So really much money. Treating population like children bad way (as counterexample, see: Japan), French government lost long ago opportunity believable disease (e.g. claimed masks useless). joke translates women spends 5 hrs shopping men spend 5 minutes ok 10pesjidi 

i really wanna believe another alt basically outed random italics know, I'm children's psychologist. I'll tell think though, think 13 year olds going absolutely fine going school months. They're growing up, they're toddlers.

When comes preteens, say, I've two instances 10-11 year old school two months, damaged way. Demise theaters? 2019 record year. There's clear difference watching movie lousy phone vs big ass screen surround sound big dark room.

Also, i'd rather fit clothes person make sure fit well rather gamble online stores. get that, saying days done already. think time people get need work, cases go down. what? Rinse repeat? point one gives shit anymore it’ll line rest diseases. Shut downs hurt heal. California great example! cases, worse deficits, worse hit business. subscribe inevitability too.

Over time younger take ton dumb young people too. side probably thinks passing stimulus hurts side themselves, since tell voting base ""it's fault, theirs"". gf waiting passports arrive cause Canada looking quite nice right Quick, fire money factory! billionaire must forced sell even part wine collection! Sorry, bot let respond fully. :)

But both. able move beyond tribalism see broken hope actually fixing things. Continuing think one bad guys good keeps us able start over. going much, need least 120 days lockdown. Like critical thinking led think Biden specifically small rallies due Covid Trump ignoring pandemic throwing large rallies instead indicates enthusiasm gap? Yeah wear blinders ignore country rotting inside course going bothered effects you. Basically Republican mantra riots. ppl protesting lockdowns seen extremist crazies. good reason.

You use cheap ones going somewhere lot people. Otherwise, get BYD(at least try buy one box) KN95. posted thing saw this. I’m glad pointing actually said. source that? don’t believe you, I’d like share it. Thanks correction Always been.

Meme aside, US long history shitty place huge part population many varied ways. Religious intolerance, racism, xenophobia etc. ingrained America's core values right founding first Puritan colonies. changed 1) happening minority people anymore, 2) internet made possible get independent information really going 3) 9/11, Bush wars, Global Financial Meltdown etc. pulled back curtain irrevocably revealed lot people American Dream® sham. turned people one another, sowed distrust government, made people feel personally responsible killing one another.
 
Ah, yes. turned people eachother by... erm... Making care people's lives...? Oh, means people get mad people obviously care people's lives. nerve! kind society I'm expected show empathy fellow country-men? 
 
Can't reality TV star bit moron. Let's get Kim K office next. Can't obviously egotistical ""genius"" (it's true said is) puts reputation well-being people. Can't guy spent regiment bitching Twitter fueling fires malcontent division, setting example idiots discourse carried out, logical discussion insults, fallacy, catch-phrases. Can't guy said real virus contributed real deaths ""their latest hoax"". Getting people scared, angry, giving enemy definitely can't applied everything he's ever said. know truth!  Yea. Every day see another ""great, breakthrough test."" Gimme something use. official single definition first wave. Depending whatever way want define ""wave"", could past first wave. One example people define peak infections followed substantial reduction. new rise peak would signal start another wave.

By definition, would third wave. Well, dont think long could easily mean year even Germany could sustain this. 6 weeks fine, asked would resistance stubborn leaders unable accept effectiveness masks, therefore unwilling provide funding kickstarting program. drug boosts immune system. hospitalized patients phase disease biggest problem overactive immune response. I'm sure even tried hospital patients begin with.

It's much likely help early disease, active immune response issue. bulk trials drug looks far promising. Title misleading. allowed outside except go grocery shopping need paper it. stores closed. Homeworking mandatory everyone possible. indeed 1 megadeth already many live Austin Maine since June.

Your head sand.

I’ve made 4 cross country trips since June two next month.

People nice. I’ve confrontations daily. TiMe, TimE

Yeah Gertrude, taking whole fuckin family you. Nah countries EU count correctly I'd say. Anger sells fear, pay attention saidwe would go outside close home. government one charge announcing details, probably last time. don’t see running away. Moving isn’t cowardly act. Moving somewhere better fits morals / value system kids could grow better environment viewed good thing. *""after several weeks stubbornly high infection rates, even nationwide lockdown, French President finally accepted need schools closed.""* vast swathes US close one living them. number also includes large deserts, mountain ranges, prairies, flyover states Alaska. Outrage brings eyeballs fear, that's proven time time again; indeed problem, seriousness COVID confused this. smart move. good luck! know Germany already tried ""root undesirables"" strategy past? go well... Username checks out. Antisocial super-spreader. know Fauci going say four months now, vaccinate millions at-risk people healthcare workers? relay y'alls conference call Everyone else keeping schools open. Man hope sarcasm many times said ""just 2 weeks""? Well, that's good, I'm likely save life one, two, even ten people every game miss, unknowingly spreading virus putting health risk! Wow, point already surpassing Spanish Flu deaths real terms hit like ton bricks.

Better start digging graves.   consider Friday morning leak daily mail. see reaction weekend, obviously really is. president doesn’t impact 99% people’s daily lives.

True, agree that. hope allow cycling exercise time...and let us go 1km home. folks saying like American lockdown idea... don’t understand freedoms you? aren’t free whatever want. wear clothes go out? Masks deal. think I've known 10 people it, nobody symptoms worse day fever, back normal onset 2 days. Also factories stumbled thing like bunch toddlers. jfc needs plastered every media outlet. sad part true. amazing 50+ countries actually helping citizens giving money stay home. yet USA won't.  Good thing capitalism working great us income inequality, spiraling towards climate change, ignoring needs many pandemic, there’s need think options might work better anyways (especially options didn’t much pesky CIA intervention behest capitalists). thanks cleaning things setting straight. I, 8 billion people planet need “do things right” system works better us, guess. likely closer double then, barring action unlikely taken without significant support financially citizenry. would require use circuit breaker lockdowns, complete mask mandate unpopular significant set people. 

I hope goes well, counting it. Mission: accomplished compared first lockdown, harsh. Macron mention anything going 1km away home example. Schools universities open, public services, desk jobs (either remote person) factories. +10 -10?

Maturity physically... Man, convince me. I'm saying is. might help understand instead calling stupid - cuz gets nowhere. phenomenon vocal minority strikes teeth never looked better. wish we'd go back shutdown. point, wish already crossed mind lately. Media distorting quotes fear mongering purposes yet again. think means normal society like pre covid. Full movie theaters, booming economy, sporting events, etc. 

Like yeah currently normal functioning society. still go grocery store, meet friends beer work, know feels modified Covid.

Edit- clarify, I'm heading local pub work. still know covid thing. saying one *can* that. pandemic fatal respiratory illness comes rolling apparently. generally pro-privacy, seems like devotion really hurt Western countries Covid.

Imagine anonymized big data set peoples movements, interactions, contacts health status. could estimate risk catching Covid every location country, shit real problem children. 

It's lot give privacy-wise, weighed context freedoms give losing control virus (lock downs, health, etc.) certainly hope I'm wrong, we're also still midst pandemic, looks like winter bad one... call freedoms. I'd call first world problems inconveniences worse.  black guy. 

Have always known. 

Shit mom warned junk elementary school. Thanks! That’s shameless disturbing... experience. Yes, statement true population, definitely all. seen, level cult-like behavior varies wildly depending live. lived Mississippi, learned real quick open atheist wasn’t good idea people would actively try shame you. live Washington, almost polar opposite. friends keep religious opinions themselves. Link university page hosts webinar[Anthony Fauci webinar University Melbourne It’s pretty much lockdown back march people masks. work. problem private life friends family, lockdown kills that. Lockdown often means shutting leisure activites like eating restaurant, swiming inside, cinemas.

Those things produce lasting value. litterly tax population pay people / companies (while closing down) long period time.

Now someone eat home instead restaurant. Someone watch movie home instead cinema. 

Oh tradegy! Sorry misunderstood. isolationist coping it. 


What comment means one freedom cause harm others. anything anyone causes harm freedom. starts monday, silly that? people use weekend last chance, last chance soread virus around🤦🏻‍♂️ US - looking clarity guidelines. workplace someone tested positive. deemed close contact person asked WFH received negative test. yesterday, today exposed people already received negative test result back office today.

Would tested positive right away? possible would test positive until, say, week now? thought anyone exposed supposed quarantine 14 days since virus incubation period 2-14 days. What’s deal Sweden nowadays? said lockdowns primary form Covid prevention. think worldwide it’s safe say lockdowns don’t really work It’s still less spent financial crisis triggered mismanaged investment banks. dozen tents on-ramp doesn’t exactly sound like definition shithole country me. Going need that. Especially compared past decade best economic growth job gains countries ever seen.. 

Yes, urbanization probably cause least 11 additional people homeless inner city prices rise certain population don’t leave. dems put stuff bill against.  Mentally mean, prospect staying inside another one two months even depressing first time. end sight shit. confirmed Germany. bars restaurants places leisure closed entire month November. people least affected Covid aren’t worried it? knew /s strong les copains We're war. think people totally get yet, we're world shaping event likes WW2. bombs landing cities troops marching country side whole world affected.

If 33,000 people died NYC bombs dropped plane, would trying open schools?

If 17,000 people shot foreign troops Texas anther 17,000 shot California, would worried eating restaurants drinking bars?

We need see war Covid. need stop thinking 2019 economy way life start thinking going win war. need war economy work rebuild peacetime economy we're side thing.

Just like car safety, seat belts, air bags, enforce drunk driving, one things perfect, implement crash mitigation safety features see vehicle fatalities decrease. need Covid treatments, need vaccines, need avoid indoor areas, need social distancing, need better ventilation filtration indoor areas, need cheep quick testing, need robust contact tracing every person needs N95's given free.

We labor, raw materials, manufacturing space. we're lacking leadership implement plan. We're also lacking population come grips horror facing. 

We're end game, we're start thing. cases going nearly every state. R0 1 nearly every state. uncontrolled exponential growth nearly every state. new- seen before. past pockets outbreak. now, outbreak everywhere. We're looking Halloween, election, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years next ten weeks. leadership population critical mass people understand severity we're facing. 

So do? Tell people love love them. Buy use N95's ventilated put surgical masks it. Avoid public indoor spaces much possible. Visit friends family live outdoors, distance masks on. Get exercise outdoors put mask close people. Use delivery services curb side pick much possible, avoid going public indoor spaces unless necessary. Use sanitizer public wash hands soon get home. Disinfect things touch often alcohol bleach solution (phone, keys, wallet, credit cards, door nobs, steering wheels, remote controls). Educate try convince others regarding situation we're facing. I’d hardly say got owned Vietnam. definitely sustained much less casualties VC. didn’t expect commitment VC continue fighting using guerrilla tactics continuing invest countless $’s manpower war public absolutely interest fighting. certainly didn’t “win” war way owned..... dunno.

Me gf back forth feel like look kids ran away. 

Like can't really come reason abandon vulnerable instead helping fight. Yeah, crazies wanting livelyhoods destroyed. crazy.

At least Germany decent support packages place unlike UK. really needs invest mental health education. That’s issue 40% feel Trump good job handling virus.

Or maybe read statistics instead informing based media hype? wanted address content comment would've done that. disagree. dems nothing foul pubs last four years. never seen bad. got pushed thru senate big middle finger dems. yet pandemic numbers, ground zero citizens criticize government 

like alt right group trying kidnap person gunpoint. ""For reason numbers keep going can't figure why. Maybe virus mutated?"" must missed part coronavirus magically ignored schools workplaces. kind lockdown working Ireland right schools open Amazon 50 $7. 2020's helluva year tried best 40 years tech 50 years old procedures. could seen coming? /s

You right. Outbreal outpaced system withen weeks. think regards America, could wrong Corner: Rounded question, thats used ""?"". Youre comment sounded bit like thought could score political point Sweden starting rough time eventually leading death. gave chance change first impression.Im sorry offended you, Im getting sick politization serious, deadly issue.

If remember, related issues related issues care homes. really know came that. That’s exactly what’s going happen haha. used care politics straight don’t give fuck anymore. Trump sucks people despise much blind realize party issues well.

This election aftermath going entertaining. Sweden lolz Day election fauci long gone silver we're talking hundreds thousands, million people long-term chronic conditions, huge societal impact.

I server. cannot afford serve (though change restaurants leaving ayce buffet go full-service). feel vulnerable waiting tables full mask-less people, handling used dishes utensils. 

In experience, people dining restaurants 'need feed family.' could takeout that. They're want someone serve them. want meet friends drink. But, people going they're allowed do, restaurants closed people dining them. guys right. germany starts monday, weekend lot people get infected🤦🏻‍♂️ so? first one pretty tough... strong les copains   Let's pretend like idiot redditor knows happened Trump. got mABs, got steroids, got remsdesivir, got Zinc, walked 3 days later. Oh all. totally relate saying. like....10 days... things felt...good first time long time. cooperating once. then...boom Try rough estimate. (Their bar ""extremely risky"" exactly think be, may want compare risk level things already do, like grocery shopping, get better idea risky something is. look percentage risk small print bottom, big colourful letters.) definitive answer, outdoor activities low risk, mask less higher risk, see comfortable with.  National lockdown=whole country Blame media outlet, OP copied word word, decent redditor would do. dad legitimately told it’s pandemic it’s casedemic deaths aren’t much. 200 plus dead people day “not bad”

How monster!?! Probably Democrats stronghold cities. states don’t want put millions people work without bail out, isn’t coming February earliest dick anything becauase get infected doesnt mean die. 

Off celebrities athletes politicans got it, nobody died critical.

The people die, already high risk. stands reason real focus designating high risk, keeping isolated. 

They need caregiver watchman practices safety protocols delivers necessities.

Think like get help need room. happens rooms filled up? Survival rate drops.
- happens staff used? survival rate drops
- happens medical supply drops? survival rate drops

The lock PREVENT COVID. REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION.
- (unless true lockdown near impossible means 0 go outside, 0 supply run, 0 everything

Think like cooking, happens start running key ingredients food starts tasting less better.

However problem survival rate. INFECTION RATE. Covid-19 spread around like crazy. Hell virus started wuhan became global. crazy. viruses exclusive regions, covid-19 isnt due INFECTION RATE

1% death rate pretty high alot people get it. example, let say 1,000,000 get covid. Bam 10,000 people dead
- Lets add super deadly virus 75% death rate, less infectious. Bam 1,000 people get “myhtical virus”. get disease mouth mouth kiss infected. Bam 2,500 people dead  Look this, someone realize bottom worse. Bowling alleys? Thought Michigan like prison.  /s article says.   Thanks link.

Compare gta density dunno, Orlando's area. Probably similar.

And finally, even yearly thing... that's way awful anyone seems acknowledge. going devastate world vaccines really really effective. better Europe. I've read stories lower viral load leading less severe cases. Could easily catch even cautious experienced lower viral loads cautious end less severe cases. would they?

The risk 10% 1% younger people 0.003% current spike cases going way currently spikes theyve yes certainly argue cases vs deaths testing rate etc. think either way safe say ways herd immunity. assuming 1/2 Political spectrum US, ENTIRE REST PLANET, wrong pretty stupid

I mean....that exactly voting base American right-wing time. come surprise anyone good 30%-40% Americans take word Republican politicians gospel. Trump says going go away heat, magically, day election; GOP Congressmen Governors nothing preach re-opening (or never locking first place) base believe it. 

Blame people want. But, can't help wonder many lives would saved GOP leaders done bare minimum back spring. goal, March-April-May, 5000 new cases day. I'd expect goal time. lucky Flu mild far right. Population density way determines number people affected virus transmits via human human contact. Voting healthier. would imagine, greater access (or amenability toward) healthcare, likely get flu shot. article actually relies multiple sources. again- scroll read paragraphs quote article 

“When comes fatalities, data consistent. CDC last week reported 121 deaths among people age 21 July 31. website, divides age categories differently, lists 34 deaths among children 0 4 58 deaths among children adolescents aged 5 17. American Academy Pediatrics lists 105 deaths Sept. 10.
The median age death 16, according CDC report examined fatalities among people younger 21. adults, covid-19 hit Black, Latino minority children disproportionately high rates.” 

Once again, last time, never mentioned mortality rate amongst teens children first place. clearly incapable addressing fact say somehow lessens ability marginalize number- however great small- child deaths occurred. 

Because incapable reading article, anything except clinging arbitrary convoluted one sided debate, worth replying anymore. probably get removed opinion editorial / political, damn good read Usually single year seem last decade events well. :( That's called American colored rose glasses Oh ok, talking ass. January, pshh quit optimistic. hasn’t even started, it’s barely getting hard. middle last least decade, social distance entirely. Yet declared defeated wouldn’t lie/s Clearly according whom? false. Outdoor activities 20x safer activity indoors. essentially guaranteed, then, outdoor activities going thing driving R0 1.

Once add masks distancing, risk effectively drops zero. 

I also disagree assertion many sure make reason ban outdoor activities. Humans social creatures total physical isolation hard. good compromises available, take them! Yeah bunch flyover states currently setting records new cases per day, including read article, headline misleading. 

Technically, things might never, truthfully ""normal"" ever again. However, January-May-ish 2021, things return *normalcy*, least United States America. might wearing masks 2022(and beyond), social distancing already ""ending"", time Spring 2021 comes around, essentially going over. Things slowly, surely start opening back up. 

Once get vaccine, I'll still wear mask, I'm social distancing. adult take vaccine, that's fault. I'll wear mask fair people choice(mainly children). watched press interview today Merkel answered question hospitality it’s necessary biggest threat. said try introduce policies hopefully soon enough time population get less behind it, basically saw already end August exponential trend started one would agree hard measures. Secondly said experts telling reduce contacts people 75%. go easier targets first. really feasible close schools. still hope people volunteerily limit contacts without hard ban. mention protests, guess concerned riots possibility goes month necessary steps don’t needed „Rückhalt“. last sentence lolll whatever reason, he's thinking ""events"" going happen soon. Pfizer thinks will. 

I'm sure many people sitting body Pfizer *actually* seeing many events fast they're happening, amount people ones truly ""know"" (as in, good hunch, like know 21 cases whatever, fast cases coming lately). 20? 60? 200? idea. beyond people, one really knows.  It’s still warm California, let’s see happens colder certainly facing 100k cases next week two, combine lack stimulus, lack leadership, probably lockdowns looking absolutely brutal winter. They're open parents can't go work young children home, germanys online infrastructure, especially schools, fucking absymal online schooling even work most.

And did, might families multiple kids might one pc home, really share watch respective lessons courses regular school times.

This could dampened requiring office jobs force home office kids forced wear masks classes alternate attendance.

But idk, like answer. Yeah, probably right. going tough getting people take even efficacy 50% :/ Yes, unfortunately would take. mind blowing people resistant complying efforts get control. one thing taken completely surprise. outrages me, scares (that people actually capable reaching level stupidity selfishness) absolutely heartbreaking. understand gotten point reality.  Lol save Christmas, fug Christmas. Thing is, getting colder. getting darker earlier every day. already got impression supermarkets especially restaurants seemed packed last weeks. inconveniet gets people meet indoors. keep up(or cancel meeting people) good you, great job. Unfortunately many responsible No, that's works.

The major precedent set forth case individual liberties unlimited, subject police powers state (state government, would include Federal government, state level).

A mask mandate would violate stipulations put forth Jacobson v. Massachusetts. that, many cases (even recent ones) establish Federal government times imminent danger times emergency broad powers restrict necessary public good. also existing laws like Public Health Service Act would allow President thing; CDC alone already told many landlords currently must evict people authority PHSA.

To believe executive branch mandate landlords evict people, cannot mandate masks kind asinine. Unfortunately able widely distribute vaccine different story entirely. +489,402 new COVID-19 cases today. New ATH. Hope loved ones you. That’s really matters end mom nurse said thing day ""nurses actually less likely get infected general population"" I'm pretty sure true? 

Anyways give covid tests regularly nurses report minor symptoms. They're short staffed overworked. upside PPE situation gotten better. feel like it’s good possibility really first big kick pants we’re getting climate change. think pandemic effects improve next year, don’t good feeling we’re overall. saying people tested positive 2.5x times less likely hospitalized. would seem either reduce mortality healthier/younger people average get flu shot. 

Also, helpful resources depict spike hospitalizations facing:

[Total currently hospitalized broken region - broken region - **per look especially hospitalizations Midwest per capita. Yikes. lump ignorant fuck. us like see true benifits another year point.

The way one person getting covid makes easier people get it, one person getting vaccine makes harder people get it. right on/off switch, benefits become observable within even two months EUA, say nothing vaccine fully approved. Rounding corner alright It’s time stamp account really matters ;) Going movies concert luxuries. That's original poster mentioned. things people live without year so.

You want blame someone, blame idiots keep politicizing basic thing ask people mentioned billion times already: masks, social distancing, hand washing.

What would suggest do? let go rampant like ever gracious ~~overlord~~ POTUS wants do? Hunger Games it, survival fittest guess. can't sprinkle people evenly across province make analysis like that.

Something something cities sort science source 10 year timeframe? first lockdown France, physical activity allowed outside (less 1km away home alone). guess time. end, that's natural selection worked centuries. It’s typo. Meant “ended dealing covid pandemic” Still going strong! [Hundreds workers died meat packing plants COVID. study great, puzzling... think, least now, must hospitalized given this. Kinda funny. Filter views conflict narrative. Reddit = free speech goes die think need optimistic, blind. What's point living point. Fauci trying compete sub “most doom gloom one week” record Let done pandemic. pandemic done us. soon ney sayers gonna rude awakening even broken finger gets turned away overfilled hospital. I'm sure usually huge endeavor, gonna hold bare bones marathon, could hundred vendors, medical staff, general cadre. getting permits close streets, could done.

I think they're probably looking financial perspective, might worth cancelled anyway. It’s truly unbelievable... number 37%. remaining 63% denial live reality went third best Costco book tour 2017 thing therapy sessions online. popular want therapy room chance household member hearing plus distraction space. potential Trump lame duck presidency, happening anyway. You’re losers lol vaccine works great 50% want it, that's great. Means get sooner! know. didn’t mean chew using ultra precise terminology. Thinking humanity defeated smallpox something gives hope. country set go near-complete lockdown starting Monday looking forward it. think it’s mostly going local governments and/or people stupid. Luckily family listens going except grocery shopping week so. friend’s parents 50’s 60’s severely obese accompanying health issues still going dinner almost every night. Feels bad  think chose live wrong continent. Yeeep certainly ended fight pandemic Damn, guess people act like children. let anyone house, wear mask go out, wash hands simple. people stupid? True. Yeah they've ""ended it"", COVID 19 different opinion. One problems many countries facing doctors missing. even add 3k ICU beds, rather useless without adding doctors nurses. doctors handle ICUs usually need 7-10 years education, meaning enough March-April, still enough days totally agree. Well, assuming second case, certainly aren’t helping 10 months later We're fucked long party charge continues deny virus exists/say flu worse/deaths inflated numbers/refuse pass aid/whatever bullshit come with. party power nearly every branch government actively hampering sort meaningful recovery process. immunological data missing SARS? .... soooo let's vote fucks again? R logic I've got American British Citizenship. past holding passports like golden ticket. Now......No one wants either. can't go work Europe thanks Brexit American passport equivalent leprosy. Maybe. estimated around 760MM people infected, 35MM reported cases around million dead.

This means case infection ratio around 1 21, IFR around 0.14%

I think what's going happen turn IFR high rich countries elderly populations. course excludes world's population, low IFR numbers bringing global average. “bad” moronic?  could thought too. legal moral issue system. public. legal right expectation privacy public. matters, public health danger gives government broad powers even violate privacy home necessary, edge morality, government that. Ehm yes? aware school you? would expect 0 correlation IFR rate growth deaths. 

But asking completely different question, right? much IFR rise there's hospital access. think data this. Infant flu mortality around 4x higher poor countries rich ones, might data point. also look IFR outbreaks taxed healthcare, though none lead collapsing. 1.1-1.4% IFR Spain, UK, NYC spring. France balanced patients across country instead using field hospitals came 0.9%. Bergamo mostly unknown, ""patient one"" town 1.7% population die, mostly home. comparison numbers like 0.4-0.7% summer. differences due different demographics (nursing homes) well hospital care. meet certain criteria, non-citizens/residents can't moment. missed entire fall semester(Aug-Dec) 8th grade Hurricane Katrina 13! I’m kind dumbass don’t think hurt schooling much. live NYC don’t feel less educated developed current peers. still understand ""lockdowns"", large amount workplaces stay open. data tracing Czechia quite clearly show, traceable infections come workplaces homes. obviously way stop people living other, curb spread, need attack workplaces, people walking outside. Yes, closing bars whatnot surely helps. Stopping non-essential production would much more. flaming hot take Holy shit, dude, hypocrite. Lockdowns way make poor people poorer keep rich people safe. Shutting schools shown increase COVID-19 deaths, Agreed. 

It’s funny many snowflakes can’t live without dining out, can’t least settle carry out. haven’t eaten restaurant probably well year simply can’t afford blow money like that. many ways entertain besides stuffing face. Give break. School college work remote isnt possible. understood they're fining saying we're it. case, we're going turning porch light. it’s “Dow sinks 900 points” half? That's optimistic you. 51,000 20 years old positive point (that's lowest age range IDPH gives) 42,400 schools started. 229 days since pandemic started case tracking wise, minus two months since school started, call 60 days. 42,400/169 days 250 per day. subtract cases 0-2 year olds 19 year olds likely still average since started. I'm saying schools issues let's pretend age group see close number daily school started. doesnt love Russian Roulette?! high school (US) least experience it’s absolutely terrible. I’m barely learning anything online classes, it’s hard stay motivated actually work teachers work extra hard try best teach us anything. Yes know use technology learn, can’t teach everything teachers can’t teach us moment. still peer-to-peer interaction, school anywhere crowded. Taking months school going fine. perfect, we're pandemic, make compromises. Dodgers World Series ""Championship"" whole city going wild. fans celebrating downtown social distancing masks. hope cause California's (a state lot good progress handling virus) case rate go sky high. Yeah, Switzerland. Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland makes three small countries Western Europa really fucked up.  work inspection gonna verify companies work home it. Dr. Fauci says take vitamin you’re deficient — here’s know[fauci says take Vitamin takes Vitamin D. Sure...if access news rest planet would perfectly valid argument.

Unfortunately access news rest planet, assuming 1/2 Political spectrum US, ENTIRE REST PLANET, wrong pretty stupid.

Every single medical expert saying since February virus BAD wearing masks washing hands often first line defense us. gotta go way ignore that, regardless *leadership* happens saying. Europe 304 new cases per million residents yesterday. USA 225 per million. presently 26% less likely get infected USA Europe. stringent lockdowns Europe could prevent inevitable Fall spikes track flu season. 

Source:Worldometers least wearing mask wrong still works mouth breathers! 🤣😂  would like speak overdose portion.
I'm person long term recovery opioid addiction. closure meetings heavy. zoom meeting problematic can't get away whatever need respite from. tangible difference ambience phone crowded room. 

The issue jurisdictions probation nothing. take drug test scheduled appointment. one drug test advance notice every two weeks. flatly enough deter anyone cases never would've taken drug test anyway.

The support system addicts pandemic undergone catastrophic collapse numbers bearing out. He's another anti-peronist twist reality fit political view, try actually sell fake reality outsiders.  Lol. Yeah, portion population well known examining evidence rationally making informed decisions using information :)

Good luck, ya silly fucks. Meanwhile Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, even China, life returned level normalcy. Yeah, think bit complicated. Based article sounds like lawyers FHM trying understand exactly cant done.

I thought quote lawyer kind interesting though:

""

Its almost like took FL's population, cut half spread 8x area would better statistics transmission virus spreads people come contact one another believe that?   let's forget climate change.

We within years ""Blue Ocean Event"", arctic ice. predicted early Sept 2020, gotten damn close. 

The ice works cooling mechanism, lacking arctic ice encourages melting. long ""BOE"" Arctic ice throughout year, vastly accelerating heating feedback loop among many issues. dont. nonsense upvoted?! hear fucking stupid sound word-vomiting second nature? It’s already pretty good, copain ! supreme court France accessible citizens challenge constitutionality order/law? Seems like French government far **far** broader emergency power US. way hell happen US.    Spanish Flu, \~650,000 Americans died two years making rounds. 

Granted, ventilators, ICU's, antibiotics matter back people died secondary bacterial infections virus ravaged immune systems lungs. keep mind currently strongly advices lockdowns viewed utmost skepticism. 

Studies found shutting school increases Covid-19 mental effects lockdown shown devastating. 

People france really resist lockdown going best interest people make politicians listen scientist WHO. No. immune systems work. Europe sick man Europe Mhmm thanks! Stupid... hyped flu. people get even get symptoms 🙄. covid deaths really deaths pre existing conditions. covid itself. trying shut everything down. believe hype Media/internet brainwashed shit. wonder country wants you. It’s almost pandemic really shitty situation matter choose approach it. Let people live lives normally see depressing walk hospitals people dying outside waiting care walking mass graves dug.

But listened experts, wore masks put selfishness aside could much better handle virus possibly living normal instead people choosing hard way we’re suffering mentally it. Deadly enough killed some. Please, go talk parent who's lost child explain deadly. I'm sure they'll really appreciate opinion. yeah went bar last week too, still wear mask walk around Isn’t California like 40 million people? 
I don’t know people upvoting it’s medieval plague 14% entirety America dies. 
You wonder people won’t take covid seriously *straight lie* 1 - 2 million Americans reasonable estimate 40 million lunatic. Vaccine probably get approved January. take 6 months manufacture distribute enough US gain herd immunity. expect go away July. Biden wins senate flips blue, allowing laws written making vaccine free. aca gets kicked Supreme Court, Trump reelected senate stays red. vaccine going cost $300 per does, ain't way 231 million Americans/insurance companies going shell kind money get us herd immunity. FFS blared everywhere months.

Personally: Stay home unless go essential reasons, go out: wear mask, social distance, wear mask, avoid large gatherings, clean hands, wear mask, avoid touching face, WEAR FUCKING MASK!

Nationally: Test. Isolate. Trace. Enforce temporary regulations prevent unnecessary gatherings.

Do need read instructions hotdogs eat sideways?  Lot friends going out, wear masks stay away family though Yeah area draw downtown is. get yokels Douglas County Weld County coming big city wander around without masks act like mouth breathers are.
 
Living heart city pandemic 0/10, would again. end eradicate virus seems. 

Recommend social distancing, whether happens people present thoughts along lines of... i'm statistically healthy 90% Americans.  
So, 1: cohort study, 2: definition ""declining rapidly"" 3: numerous studies saying opposite several reports people infected 2nd time. guy ICU weekend second time, May time Oct. Probably good time buy. soon vaccine announced, shoot up. Takeout make food...

Restaurants exist pandemic type, understand whether people conflating emotional weakness simpleness isolation idea charity sbo.

Capitalism WRONG. Small businesses closed threat bankruptcy. second time got less severe?

Of dozens anecdotes I’ve read people contracting virus twice, one symptoms severe second time, still question veracity claim. Psycho shit Sure administration constantly undermines experts, data, science general, yes *the people's fault* half us wearing masks. Fauci seems one US cabinet actually knowledgeable pandemic control viruses spread. truly feel bad guy. it’s nose, aren’t wearing mask. sub loves tout ""just listen science"" comes schools everyone takes granted super spreader locations. Meanwhile, seem clear cut scientific community, e.g. gut feeling also tells everything closing lockdown successful, really true schools driver pandemic seems kind lockdown optimal one. Again, want see discussion involving science presumptions.  Hahahah: ""Lockdown work. shall do?""

""Er, lockdown?""

Fucking hell. world gone mad.  think Fed print trillions preserve asset prices stave deflation nuts. 

As long powerful military print money infinity downside. Equipment stuck France? can’t provide healthcare? think countries closed? exactly reason. Tell country Europe didn’t get healthcare equipment “stuck” somewhere 

My point saying Sweden sucks done hard lockdown. fact Sweden seen, demographic structure social habits hard lockdown necessary. generally speaking think competence healthcare professional really really good. That’s said wanted go may herd immunity, listened tegnel thought would safe there.

My point that, run antibiotics, morphine (fact) . It’s probably right time say “hey guys maybe it’s good time close restaurants” instead (and literally response) “can’t serve alcohol restaurants it’s seated”. 

Sweden one best organised countries world great people love working Swedish colleagues. Hell given world IKEA (best class supply chain) Volvo (safest cars). people talk Sweden’s response, remember talking country. 

What talking cockyness individual response, “we know better countries” guy/ institution basically minimised deaths risk still refuses admit assumptions wrong learned next time. don’t think people shaming Belgium Italy? way 

And that’s Tom Britton.... good start. ...and presumably open returning EU citizens? enter France EU country, also able enter France anywhere else, even it’s transit get home country, right? would happy entertain well thought counter argument since see personal attacks I'm assuming intelligence, mental stamina data necessary engage others like resort fantasies. that’s case, IFR even lower hope is. lot carnage second wave happened hospitals short staffed due deployments, doctors/nurses went work sick, die either exhaustion contracting flu. bodies started stack hallways.

I fear time around even wake-up call some. absolutely idea you’re even saying. can’t get emigrate US. It’s nearly impossible best times lifespan short us really learn anything well enough lasting impact, new generations particularly listen well came them. issue call real second wave saying we're 3rd.

I like calling 3rd peak, let's honest 2020 taught us anything shit could mutate become worse end next year.

That's second wave spooky AF. mean, community college pretty cheap. Loans also easy pay back get job even shitty English teacher Korea. Back taught, pretty normal among teachers knew send 1-2k month back US pay loans.

I personally would never able pay university get basically full ride via scholarships. Agreed, though little personal responsibility would US Citizenry INSANE amount good right now.

Not going happen course. would certainly last ones I’d test. don’t see children take risk. Neither see could consent this. leader country actively following guidelines encouraging others expect happen? would still idiot douchebags complaining, real leadership taking strong stand wearing mask unacceptable things would significantly different. Instead bafoon actively encouraging spreading virus. Indeed, one them. become quite obvious following development pandemic, many ‘scientists’ guessing even claim high level certainty, like make bold predictions catch bit limelight.

Britton even said would bet house quarter half million swedes already infected April 6, don’t think anyone took Social distancing can't go forever either. Here's latest case/charts Newark (Essex things less control past weeks.

Essex county ranks 32nd per capita deaths 268.10 deaths per 100k population, 4x US per capita average. what? Upholding lease? legal document parties sign ensure performance, especially times tough. Pay GTFO! .....i'm going need source that. really. Yeah outward restrictions might similar time, clear open close based infection numbers are. Sweden degree much rigid it, also close March April like Norway Art imitating life  GWB reserves. went AWOL without consequences once. can't take trip many people ""living lives"" spreading virus getting people killed.

Such selfish people. 3 weeks ago one colleague positively tested. okay, said stay bed couple days, that’s it. 

Yesterday heard another colleague mine got it, well parents grandmother. still bedrest. hope it’s also ‘bad couple days’ type symptoms nothing emphasized lmao mainly drinking alchohol drinking water go along way positive mindset focus. Vote Joe! able work corona, can't shop eat want infect people. zero people cared consented risk odds could still everyday things even infected.  ""Task Manager stopped responding"" dialog stopped responding. ....New Tears... People like tell sort thing, validating believe better person someone could something like that.

Have ever watched young male child get really, really angry someone hit them?  self control knowledge fight, exactly, pummel object anger fast fists, they're trying achieve goal injuring them, they're expressing emotion violence. knife kind hand get dozens stab wounds.

Everyone capable violence, acknowledging leave door open happen. Task failed successfully. married, implied. lot early videos people suddenly dying streets China like this. contract Covid Sturgis? :) :) points·[31 minutes no. That’s neighbors. Anyways sounds like missing point. order magnitude almost Europe. Tegnell expected lower. Even basically taunted them. point·[5 minutes think need look meaning order magnitude. I’m sure know really means. Second didn’t saw Europe. Never Tegnell. Third Tegnell didn’t put time frame it. Maybe read article see said. What’s happening today isn’t line said. Maybe disagree believe would odd man out.""

&amp;#x200B;

At point im going flag either moron troll hospitals still underutilized. bill always come due. bottom line: Republicans belief they, they, suited power. mask wearing definitely contributed bringing cases down. mean he's going history books accomplishments. Unlike pretty much every redditor lol someone lost parent right pandemic hit, idea skipping family holiday events top grief first holidays without loved one devastating. see she’s pushing hard. family won’t traveling see family holidays though extended family believes Covid big deal won’t agree precautions. sounds like cousin taking seriously though. mother-in-law agreed holidays way described, would go least hours. wouldn’t even agree outdoor visits spring ... yeah. God can’t wait November 4. Thank you, Mr. President!


Obvious /s sounds like ""Nothing"" whole lot lose weight Now, get wrong, I'm trying undermine effectiveness Vitamin D. good health, getting daily doses - either going outside frequently exposing sun, taking Vitamin supplements, eating foods good sources Vitamin D, like fortified milk.

However, need make clear Vitamin *supplement* to, *replacement* currently existing mitigation measures. Experts recommend Vitamin everyone, replace social distancing, mask wearing, vaccines, lockdown, school closures. Vitamin D, matter may think it, ""get mandates free"" card. 

Without Vitamin D, we're already well; cases rise many places, necessitating return lockdown (or least *should* going back lockdown... :|). would make anyone think recommending Vitamin it'll give us leeway remove measures? 

Think ""Swiss Cheese"" model trending front page sub ago. None measures would hold well own, ""holes"" them. combined together, effectively curb spread virus (but *only* they're followed, course, seems problem live), evidenced ""success stories"" South Korea, Vietnam, Victoria. measures layered top one another, ""slices"" cheese, better. Yeah, like China build new hospital 10 days. wrong, learning disabilities special needs. alright, nice day too.  10 years corona winter going brutal. Look happened Latin America winter (Ecuador, Peru Mexico excess deaths staggering). Maybe get Reddit seem depressed really pathetic think agree talk past other.

They work prevent overrun hospitals nothing prevent build again.

We've terrible Europe enacting long term preventive measure. I've thinking 5 months stupid tourism, open restaurants, general lot dumb risks taken.

I've seen instance eating places open, tables outside empty inside full, cheap crappy food.

I understand people risk getting bad disease reward cheap burger, also understand whythey go wife French government employee, even right cases spiking remotely close overrunning hospital system. 

Quite hospitals getting mean, din't lockdown like 99.99% capacity. overshoot lot. prohibit certain types outdoor activities, minimal risk activities like going walk. I’ve heard thread ability already. Well, Fauci ssid must true thought virus predominantly higher fatality rate men? agree completely amount hubris people pointing something (which often anecdotal) \*the\* reason new wave pretty exhausting. nature, virus incredibly hard predict resulting human reaction virus.

Multiple things also true time. E.g., virus fatigue may playing part Europe top colder weather. collectivist cultures mask wearing Japan Asian countries may enough may also overlapping factors preexisting immunity.

It's fine speculate yelling ""people stopped caring and/or wear masks enough!!"" extremely narrow-minded. Annyeong! [CALL really, work 9am-7pm lunch hour count.

Is US really worse that? later said “poorly written” clarified one “goals,” course bullshit looks like we're back seeing lockdowns again. Ireland, France Germany lockdown. European countries probably follow suit well. Anyone reckon US states go back lockdown not? gave translated article reputable source. wrong that? Yes. could collect 1000 times much data still much noise really sort differences cause, could differ unpredictably nation nation. example, non linear effects small average changes could predominate certain circumstances. many variables could be. country x average tendency stand 5% closer basic rules, compliance level, mobility, density -
it could tipping point makes difference 20% potential weekly spread. would extremely hard collect data sift 1000s variables may play significant effect, let alone ones might chance rigorously measuring. taking vaccine actually see inject congress senate anyone else involved circus. names people died Krakatoa eruption? mean, atleast mean Pfizer probably hit 32 people infected quickly. split hairs stick painfully neutral tone avoid possibility wrong, may win sort internet argument points push people away alienate others. 

Enjoy perpetual moral high ground, reality continue course regardless right wrong are. reason enlightened centrist meme exists. Covid showing racism xenophoby countries around world.

When Brazil increasingly cases without control, everyone closed borders. France Germany increasingly cases without control, see single closed border. go back work preschool reopened. decide anything. ask inhabitants want close retirement homes imo. dont think fair lock away elderly wishes better numbers feel better enjoying freedoms. Imagine needing GF cosign RENTAL BMW lmfao, going Reddit calling someone basement-dwelling dependant. wonder many seasonal flu/winter cold deaths going renamed covid deaths hospitals get money fun, work. AKA Fox News. cap 50 ppl large events since beginning.

I know. cousin lives Sweden visited summer low obesity rate. Stockholm, largest city, also higher percentage single person households social distancing already built in.

It also higher percentage cramped apartment living US standards, well large percentage ""multigenerational living"" 25% immigration per-capita death rate several times higher Nordic countries restricted, though.

And percapita death rate also much lower several countries implemented harder lockdowns. tell us?

[Norway jealous Sweden's ""lockdown light"" . . urged authorities avoid taking heavy-handed approach event second wave infections. Nope. v ponderous people don’t get time. “Our” poor behavior dragging whole situation even longer... HURTING EVERYONE KILLING MANY!
At least area people wearing masks shopping. It’s restaurants, bars social activities leading way spreading mess. know president incompetent, likewise teacher told students bully another student hope would intuition know time listen authority correct? blindly follow share blame. Makes sense, mean vaccine never going even given EUA earliest November 15th due FDA's 2 month safety requirement. probably wont given EUA week 2 3rd week November. ""My name Jeff, I'm politician. I'm fella thinks beer cold boots dusty. think 9/11 bad. freedom, well think that's little bit better."" need real plan. wear masks diligently understand 100% compliance fantasy wish. like saying hope people stop stealing, rape would longer exist. 

Obviously can't continue remain locked-down Fall 2021 reality people live with. point, people going start taking 1/500 risk lieu 100% certainty able feed kids, losing home/apt, draining retirement savings. people stop complying, can't arrest everyone. Sorry, truth. 

We need real-life plan people actually work with, I'm hearing side aisle right extraordinarily frustrating. Private gatherings parties ones trace. can't identify 80%, idea big role actually is. mainly weekends I'm worried two young kids. go day park, zoo, river, bike rides, flea markets etc. I'm hoping another 1hr max shopping, drs, exercise p/day. brutal! even difficult vast majority population wear mask. Hell, winter even warms face cold! ""good place start"" wearing mask public, social distancing, practicing basic hygiene like frequent hand washing using hand sanitizer can't wash hands.

Some studies shown people deficient vitamin hit harder respiratory viruses, deficient taking excess vitamin going help Gates qualified expert?

Dude, one mentioned missed something?

You missed fact there's evidence vitamin prevent infection, reduce hospitalization, anything else people known deficient. Kids well looked-after aren’t ones danger. I’m glad well.

But I’m opposed discourse option distance learning kids watch grandparents die. safety elders many factors. closed everything except schools, adults fully complied restrictions, kids could school *and* grandparents. It’s either or. That’s false. curve gone remained relatively flat. hysteria another surge happening areas haven’t one yet. surging areas have. seems mid west’s surge simply delayed due low population density. part, fine here. Ok would kissing holding public office good bye terms up.

Also did, would enforce it? Clearly police. discount terrible way Floridians dealt this, experience people Destin state. sure time year though. That’s still staying home though...the point wait longest line stay house   remember shot. pretty young, remember school flag half-mast. world stood still, like catch breath. sad. Exactly. everyone would stay home 2 weeks over. (Of course possible) I'm saying states may states not. 28 (UPI) -- People received flu vaccine year testing positive COVID-19 nearly 2 1/2 times less likely hospitalized severe form disease vaccinated, analysis published Wednesday Journal American Board Family Medicine addition, vaccinated flu within year diagnosed COVID-19 three times less likely admitted intensive care unit new coronavirus, according researchers University flu vaccine not, however, offer protection COVID-19, researchers said. one loves Russian roulette. choice many people either don’t go out, know you’ll stay healthy you’ll risk losing house, car, savings, etc, vs go out, yeah maybe you’ll get sick least make monthly payments odds real damage low. Obviously people going pick second option it’s totally understandable why. difficult concept people grasp, really don’t get it. go herd immunity can't travel local region european flights still open

So travel France, within region arrive in? Lol, ironic coming party solves every problem telling homeless people like Bill gates. 

The U.S. ability, resources education much closer ""being like germany"" homeless person like Bill gates. 

And thing is.. even try COME CLOSE, much better trying all. guess: people allowed go control shutdown last much longer.

Schools needed parents able work. lock work, would probably next step though. think real value is. vaccine technology perfected, imagine something like readily available beginning pandemic. 

It would really offset economic impact everyone could breath tube way work. knowing right away would prevent spreading it.   friends people? person capable forming sentence think lockdown flattened curve unrelated. really doomed. lot deeper right considering amount people access PPE, choose wear properly/go crowded areas events shouldn't. Unless specifically talking hospitals? US vs. Vietnam. US + South Vietnam vs. North Vietnam. South Vietnamese casualties US side that's even. North Vietnam decisively Saigon conquered southern leadership fled.

US also killed tons South Vietnamese civilians, North (not acceptable either way). dangerous South Vietnamese allied civilian enemy North Vietnamese soldier. self imposed, since march still counting we're winning! Winter coming necessary people would stay fuck home reduce risk expense restaurant meals unmasked strolling about.

This sounds like optics rather risk management. However epidemic curve steep March health authorities expected hospitals fill measures time take effect. talking three week window happened. Triage guidelines simply deemed necessary situation. suppose depends definition Armageddon. estimates place total deaths upward 500k. reference makes deadlier WW2 US.

That bit silly comparison. 500,000 people die every year smoking, nobody comes WWII comparisons large share solely due Trump's ineptitude.

I'm american thing mystifies me.

You know USA #10 ranked per-capita deaths, right?

Here countries worse - 

San Marino, Peru, Belgium, Andorra, Spain, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador.

They preformed ""worse"" USA. think leaders worse Trump? Days till Christmas: **58**

Current deaths: needed reach 300,000: 300,000 - 225,985 = **74,015**

Average Deaths per day reach 300,000 deaths Christmas: 74,015/58 = **1,276**

Seems pretty likely. suck miss moment.

But right infect others hold trophy?

Meanwhile doctors missing time families keep idiots like alive. really? wear masks mandatory like gas stations, walmart, malls, restaurants, etc dont wear masks hit clubs ppl walking street night. Florida fine. many people die every year great white shark attacks?

 bet people also getting counted Covid Deaths! /s

 MeAn, SeReOuSlY pEoPlE! US + South Vietnam vs. North Vietnam + China almost countries tried lock almost countries seeing huge flare-ups, wouldn’t conclusion lock downs don’t work stop spread, even delay them? 

Rather “governments people stupid”? China already signed Oxford AstraZeneca also 2 domestic vaccine candidates already along phase 3 trials.

Pfizer vaccine requires -70 C cold chain might suitable countries anyways. bombs actively falling falling school speak. perfect analogy people acting Pandemic already happened article specifically starting. anything makes sense would strengthen immune system. Like muscle tend lose don’t exercise, pretty much everyone’s immune systems stand mode stay home days nothing like American lockdown. people stay inside non stop except rare walk outside.

What groceries? 

Because grocery &amp; liquor stores buildings I've inside months. absolutely wrong. Mask mandates end virus within peoples’ risk tolerance. come vulnerable vaccinated availability vaccines general public.

Masks mandated Asian countries, worn choice normal times.

That situation here. 100% fine wearing mask get vaccinated later tiers. upper tiers suspect need masks certain number people get shot.

Also, doctors speak best health don’t really take wide view situation. say best disease transmission, best society whole. broader policy discussion contribute to, direct. wait tell us stimulus March! always prediction, people can't Really imagine / empathize proper degree somberness respect something really bad happens one person know. No. Nothing.  factor people change behavior based ""I vaccinated yesterday - I'm safe!"" ""vaccine released yesterday, prolly everyone else immune can't catch it..."" PSAs much. Yet still hear idiots US saying it'll magically go away election day. competent handling, could reality week.

Vote.  World leaders different standard medical care us normies. exactly! agree more. whole we're going ""crumbles"", people sacrificed. Naw they’re going start blaming Biden well January 21. would Obama mean like caRaVaN did? shutdown going work, need hospitals doctors. problem, symptom much deeper issues.

Can’t both? Like he’s much huge fucking problem, didn’t start won’t end him. 

Someone might alcoholic past trauma, still figure handle alcohol problem even begin dig deeper. course dig deeper figure stuff don’t want alcoholism return. It’s loose analogy think clarifies point. 

It’s frustrating hear “he’s problem, he’s symptom” talking point sort minimizes contribution larger problems lot people, he’s much immediate problem. 

Not took offense use it. It’s something I’ve thinking about. sums trump easily conveniently. 👍

I mean, I'd course want visit actually move, far, everything I've heard people who, again, actually live different perception someone knew vaguest american assumptions it. wasn’t tweet. said “press conference” would disappear “like miracle”. definitely pretty wild. Best keep wearing masks careful. someone medical field I’m looking forward one first tiers. Vaccines important one wants first guinea pig new medication vaccine.  live Ireland, research seem wrong. Cases Ireland risen dramatically since reopening Originally linking idea common civic ideology. founding principles written Declaration Independence Bill Rights.

What seems happening we’re witnessing system trying correct growing amount internal extremism. It’s bit unprecedented visible quickly news travels internet, mention ease external influence makes way route. What? First you’re wrong. grew North Jersey. Second point logical. think there’s usually 1,000 hanging late Iron Bound going drive ass Nutley hang instead? Why, there’s nothing there? Tons people Newark don’t even cars. Iron Bound unique cultural center isn’t going duplicated elsewhere. Sure there’s people might driving Iberia’s pick new restaurant something method isn’t 100% effective doesn’t mean isn’t worthwhile sure know works france look cases got last days normally know happen  models never work practice, since incredibly hard everyone get infected, we're hoping herd immunity without vaccine, need many people infected fast possible order achieve it. Yes unfortunate hospital management better job shielding doctors pandemic. Hopefully they'll improve doctors start quitting jobs spot.  Nah, maybe other, responsible nations voluntary, America, make mandatory. apparently one cares public health. Don’t know that’s relevant coronavirus. 

It’s even relevant election since that’s it’s decided. 

So what’s point. strong selfish culture pervasive US many groups people care neighbor community. Often times people unfortunately care might directly affect make things worse largely short sighted anti science. words see immediate impact must matter problem.   think missed bit every ramp entire urban corridor. also economically prosperous area, want shithole, go small towns rural areas suffering economic losses decades.

Economic growth number jobs deceptive metrics. first ignores distribution growth, largely incredibly wealthy rest curve stagnates. second ignores job quality. working one job make ends meet, working two jobs still can't make ends meet, number jobs grew I'm still water.

""Certain populations leave."" go where? Cities best opportunities. resources? living tent highway ability get go somewhere else. Mental health doesn’t excuse bullshit. they’re psychotic danger others lock know countries would succumb first ever zombie apocalypse. People complaining freedom despite high covid deaths pure stupidity point 2020. country, enjoy. Yes, FHM close smaller geographical areas confirmed dangerous, communicable disease, people can't pass them. mentioned limited may however stop people visiting human made structures like building, roads etc.

This seen before. FHM would want close specific building I'm sure could (as mentioned above). road however, see could.

If anyone ielse reading wondering sources, link find constitution PDF. look ""Laws"" section. specific sections important discussion read ""The instrument government"" 2nd chapter, articles 6-8. Hopefully Cash COVIDs manager pulls starting pitcher get back thing. Yup, many say USA broke British wanted freedom, Britain already banned slavery mainland Europe also slowly banning colonies. companies gaining exorbitant political power Asia like British east India company, government noticed colonists shorting dealing trade corruption well selling excess yield dutch without British government approval. passed certain financial regulations 1773 banks London well increasing taxes levied. doubt coincidence decades British ban slavery well punishing corrupt British officials, US continental congress decided rebel create oligarchy. might contentious ask fair raise taxes usa political corruption uncovered across side world. part government, managing deficit transferring funding one place another. Basically taxing wealthy parts empire maintain poorer parts empire well, exactly norm either. Every article read February/March ended ""the thread public still remains low"", actual lockdowns happened.

In February saw videos getting censored here, Wuhan doctors screaming break room. one full ppe crying saying death lay ahead. Yet suspiciously, somehow *none* got covered western media, thus leaving people belief ""it's flu, bro"" team Fauci’s boss Trump on? must work healthcare. 100% guarantee right majority hospitals staffed overworked. work ER hours cut short staffed since pandemic started. still reusing masks running gloves supplies. really work school continuing. Far really. I’m independent far side anything.

If think masks don’t matter day day life you’re moron already know.

You’re ignoring world around feel ignorance bliss.

You can’t way right now. change point though. Imagine social media internet. always 1984 Hehe, worries. context always lost bit text excess money, store asset that's likely affected rapid inflation. u/pesjidi torrent

If want accuse alt account users, least get names right. guess, mandatory doctor offices congregate care facilities bit. mandatory planes really strictly enforced, airports. places mask-free vaccine widely available. Wisconsin. goddamn shit show here. I'm scared go anywhere. tweet kinda confusing. “lockdown” “school working” contradict number Covid-19 deaths US could larger population US states combined. 

totally possible. Wyoming 580k people Vermont 620k. Hurr durr America bad let’s jump ship  They'd like damn Antifa really got them. Stupid democrat governors mean, worse response government fewer people comply basic safety, longer timeline gets. better compliance anything resembling national strategy, would probably retract. estimate based current situation.  disagree first statement. plenty people assigned every excess directly related COVID, especially Twitter plenty blue check marks. I've seeing 29-44 excess death percentage increase Twitter people tens thousands followers attributing directly COVID. Plenty people turned blind eye issues since fit narrative. That's works. See China/Australia /Vietnam/NZ. Nobody needs lockdown year unless keep taking foot pedal.  little stat gives sight Scientists see kept TV:

If efficiency vaccine 60% 60% population takes it, that's 40% immunity (as positive estimate). That's enough stop virus spread deaths.

Being realistic we'll still position next winter, it'll bit normal.

IMO thing around 5 years. Government tell Scientists muffled realistic, think populace can't handle truth.

In WW1 British troops sent away war. told they'd home Christmas. war raged nearly 6 years. Government knew long would last keeping moral priority. Oh, sorry, bad, thought meant keeping factories open new. Hell might qualify refugee soon trump re-elected. No, that’s definitely play playbook. love Democrats hold reins crisis. get too. anyway finally step, opinion least week late agree that, age 13, you’ll fine. You’re developing like toddler, you’re fluent technology remote learning requires, and, fair, age, people don’t exactly flourishing social life like might early twenties. might extrapolating experiences, dunno.

Younger I’m quite convinced school closures last resort. Young children easily traumatized think, even months set back stuff like speech development* effects don’t yet fully understand. 

** report summer number toddlers going speech therapist increased sharply places lockdowns. Don’t time look now, though. study fine. show decline antibodies, don’t disappear leave body. naturally decline normal. 

The media’s interpretation antibody disappear would mean mass reinfection absolutely misinformation.  ok Sars-Cov-2 virus circulate population, life largely return normal.

Who said that? I'd like source. really lockdown. Republicans ones stalling anything passing. relevant virus quickly spread workplace rendering impossible operate anyone even symptoms?

edit: takes one group meeting restaurant defiant anti-distancing attitude knock whole staff. Seems risky struggling business owner. course. hope able feel bit better. understand feel tho, year rough! Also, awesome username  great comeback! heard witty retort since grade school fucking degenerate sack shit. Known troll alt account u/pesjidi torrent Homeworking mandatory everyone

How enforced? I’m actually close family. I’m assuming anything. know exactly situation is. 

I don’t owe detailed explanation lives. say complete confidence personal professional opinion 50/50 split family going benefits parents feeling like it’s equal. It’s stressful kid neither parent 100 percent right wrong. think needs live fully one parent spend time other. 

The girl goes school day plays kids without masks social distancing. dad/grandparents know take school custody days. taking extreme privations make sense would live time. It’s scary stressful traumatizing 4 yr old pressure killing grandparents. going healthy, even you, brave keyboard warrior, don’t understand trump used DPA ensure hotdogs burgers 4th, masks. I'm troll. I'm man word, actually believe say. Also, first account.  trying best help everyone! 

you ungrateful piece shit happened brave pioneers standing saying “I’ve done expected me, I’m giving anymore prime years”? Last time Fauci told us fucking terribly we’re handling saw scores replies telling go shove it.

This thread. alternatively lots people know others including possibly virus nothing winter's cold.

Then simply ignore government restrictions forthwith Seriously. study said antibodies decline rapidly released week ago. gives? 10% ICU units use already. cases seem double every 10 days germany would overwhelm capacity around 3 weeks. Ignoring germany already problem hospital workers.


another point contact tracing explain 25% infected... bad sign.


also case one case many.  really thought going coming together moment US somehow got divided even further.

You blame *entirely* media. poisoning society. Well, ""some point"" far even concerned it. Instead, need think live *new* normal. science says vaccine prevents COVID-19 syndrome, ok Sars-Cov-2 virus circulate population, life largely return normal

do even believe science? Well I’d try talk many benefits democratic socialism, libraries, fire departments etc honestly it’s lost cause.....sigh Juarez El Paso one community separated national border, people crossing often dual citizens? US citizens show Mexican passport come Juarez.







If they're serious, Juarez give two week notice they're closing border (exception commercial goods) Oh thank goodness, training going well year, previous 34 years either. point don’t know think, there’s solid data supporting conclusions work office environment. Another statement reeking privilege.

This part defense someone acquired enough capital open business? employees? employees offered extra $600 week make it, could use purchase goods services. possible lockdown month, ~~eradicate virus~~ (buy enough time roll national rapid testing, PPE production, contact tracing, research, safety guidelines), provide financial support needed directly businesses needed it, wouldn’t done that?

Because President said real states figure themselves, that's trying do. failed one political party turned public health sanitation political wedge issue.

Edit: Strongest evidence case professional sports leagues shut without told government shelter-in-place orders started. ""second wave"" hits first wave still basically peak, wave.

Looking graph posted: peak ""first wave"" little 30,000 bottom ""second wave little 20,000.

So ""waves"" started 0, went 30,000 20,000. That's calling first wave. Same. one main reasons I'm trying hard get Covid. wan suck long hauler symptoms organ damage rest life. Leaders lead. I'm voting once. Yeah, no. I've living non-EU expat France 9 years guarantee that's gonna happen. fuck would precautions place 6 months pandemic basically people significant risk elderly??? taking crazy pills? wasting time reddit yet say ""they testing more"". must different species kind intelligent. get it. Republicans think important pack court crooked partisan hack Judge feed starving American people stimulate economy. nominated got court record time, can't help us Americans we're hurting most? even Mitch knows Trump going lose election want give Biden good economy takes office. Mitch confidence Trump winning would worked Dems pass stimulus election fast got crooked anti abortion hack judge court. clear day, REPUBLICANS GIVE DAMN US. Crystal clear. Ummm wut ur still going school work lmfao

I havent done much besides go work 7 months, treat get back office

School’s huge social interaction tho shit fun kid ah ok, given yeah, schools wouldn’t opened Santa ICU temp Absolutely, masks almost certainly better masks everything else stays same. Sweden taking measures proven scientifically, studies published supporting mask wearing thus far I’ve heard one published coming week. hopefully people forced wear masks soon Google hospitals full, care denied everyone else. 

Hospitals near getting patients fucksticks next state refuse wear masks, filled hospitals. see full hospitals nationwide. then, nightmares. 

Serious heart attack? You’re corpse. Bad stroke? Corpse. Bad car crash? Corpse. Fall ladder badly break femur? Corpse. Bad allergic reaction? Corpse. sorts shit handle suddenly become deadly there’s capacity treat it. 

That’s scaremongering, it’s acknowledging fucking reality. Yeah 3 group 7 got tested going lake ozarks 4th, came back positive 4th got tested week later work came back inconclusive negative day later. rest tested negative week. One guys positive test said felt day before, achy went run, back normal day later.

The others lost sense taste smell ill-effects. Ages range 25-34, live Austin though spend tons time outside Vitamin thing merit probably abundance it. judge making comments??? [when magic can’t argue stupid. Again, you’re assuming things. studies linked don’t prove anything besides spending equals living longer. evidence they’ll spending less healthcare this. again, you’re argument conjecture. 

Hospitals risk being[overwhelmed speak. happens, deaths skyrocket people need basic care like oxygen can’t get might die too. I'm supposed see Scorpions May 2021. Las Vegas. Wish luck! cowering fear? concerned pessimistic doesn’t mean fearful. Everyone gets vast majority people fine. us also realize even though personally fine, actually care fellow human beings going sick possibly die. also care impact healthcare workers. addition, costs inaction aren’t loss human life. also long term effects - physiological financial - many survivors going cope years. person become unstable?  true, Minneapolis would seen massive surge cases protests. didn’t.

I see argument prohibiting certain types outdoor activities, something like going walk outside exceptionally low risk.  Nah. ain't gonna happen. Shit's obviously bad boomer era coming end we're seeing high number Millennials Zoomers coming in. We're gonna look era deep pit took long time dig of. Coachella? they'll either play either April October 2021, far. doesnt seem conflicting, seems antibodies range effectiveness still worked out. current range seems ~6 months working wide range is. really good hear effective treatment going winter months. hope medical Advance lead people coming complacent potentially infected. still long way go vaccine regeneron treatments reserved risk ICU hospitalization. &amp;#x200B;

 Remindme! 1 January POP WHAT?! TRYING SAY?  I'm thinking air purifier might effective?

And, lamp thing, need wear sunscreen house? No, fans apparently.  China massive restrictive lockdowns, Korea. Hospitals thing needed. mask mandates found unconstitutional sooner later

This Canada. rights freedoms secondary public interest. entirely legal government require citizen wear $1 piece cloth face, government thinks public interest due whole pandemic thing. security cameras everywhere could catch criminals.
If track monetary transactions could catch frauds.


I really mind giving privacy today. wrong people gets charge information might used track people different opinions. Way ignore entire question go straight personal insult. Nice. trust donate 100% excess income covid relief charities? 

I mean kept money would profiting others suffer. could you? attitude I’m alarmed claim. feels EXTREMELY Orwellian. COVID very, _very_ clearly over, long, _LONG_ shot, go, saying ended it. It’s fucking insane. It’s scary. It’s diabolical. see one first many declarations-to-come extremely obviously true, say whatever fuck want flock believe them.

I’m genuinely alarmed. See people know living pay check pay check, it’s giving fuck high school. good high school:college, still pay check pay check, truly feel deserve more. someone like me, it’s slap face take pay cut...it’s like hard work nothing. might well slacked school socialism came play.  Except me...I can’t chef :( Nobody predicting European lockdowns October.  read perfect enlightened defeat COVID early.  theme every thread reduced cases summer. clearly lol Would rather look kids explain refused escape late?  ok! downvote understand reference! Instead I'll explain. reference office. :)

He actually get wrong though, ""turntables"" ""turns table."" Unless reference thought was. :) Additionally, “60% efficacy” number point pure speculation. data yet phase 3 trials vaccine efficacies whether provide sterilizing immunity. ""personal liberties"" end others safety begins. Little Johnny brought virus home killed mom, dad grandparents. That's ok though, got socialize buds. path ""problem solving""

just people could trusted would ideal, see plenty examples southern europe masks people ignore distancing.

Not Southern Europe. I've Chinese mall (Pacific Mall Markham) Canada months back saw described. people cover nose mask too!

Suffice say, going crowded malls time soon. think extreme scenarios completely unknown circumstances created? can't really create scientific model parameters simply unknown. usually way much work compared predicting probable scenarios time results really accurate. basically educated guess high margin error cases. that's I've well.

Here basic parameters you: Half population infected, 25% IFR = 41M deaths. two parameters think unrealistic extreme, worst case scenario? 
The US currently CFR 2,5%, lets simply assume that's IFR well. gives 4.1M deaths half population infected. 41M 4.1M factor 10. much seem implausible. Compare early estimates Covid-19 IFR probably also find corridor predictions factor 5-15.
Or lets even assume far milder scenario: vaccines working take years develop (just side note: even vaccine common cold yet, also often caused another corona virus). Lets take 4.1M deaths before, two years Covid-19 could mean 8.2M deaths, 5 years would mean 20.5M 10 years also end 41M deaths. 

But, say again: talking absolute extreme worst scenario improbable - Trump became president Britain left EU, even absurd things like actually happen. multiple vaccine candidates look promising countries around world successfully used measures contain virus. whatever possible predictions Dr. Fauci experts making, ones highest probability happening. open curfew. Pretty sure gonna closed lockdown though ""This basically flu."" 

Me: Sure buddy. Build wall make Mexico pay it. Lots suicides among youth right now, too. Also ton overdoses. Especially shutdown states West Coast. They've never really eased youth restrictions. 

I think policymakers listen experts balancing COVID diseases despair.

Every epidemiologist suggests schools sports almost partially open unless disease rate severe, one cares.

COVID bad, things. making intelligent, science-based decisions based social science medical science. First all, that’s incorrect. 

Secondly, children interact kids. 

Jesus fucking CHRIST stupid actually be? burning. Lovely. China treats HK rioters better US does. Every water treatment facility country testing data aggregated made publicly available.

This happened months ago. due losing loved one insensitive assholes capitalism forced keep working, kind thing. dont know numbers are, doubts. I'm anxious call young I've seen.  I've seen quite 50-60 year old people terrible shape without covid refuse wear masks. Lol it’s free reason take care them, no? Both.

It's good infected younger they're way less sever infections die.

But virus slowly creeping older population, getting worse faster. either hospitals hospitality.

They made right choice.  Instead clapping balconies trained fallback relief force summer.

But nah... would cost money. perfectly right worrying this, lockdown, perfectly likeable measures well (such curfew, actually totally useless fighting disease), actually even worrying would probably less opposition them. high level, Infection rate cases population. New cases mean infection rate goes up. Source? I've seen males higher risk Well problem market one buying anything right since there’s stimulus people buying stocks seems suspect. said may end right valuations etc, saying worst case scenario never smart move. Things always get worse........ Instead losing 3 weeks pay sales, let’s shut economy 8 months lose 8 months sales pay!

We shut 8 months, evidenced story people restaurant went inside. There's also magical little thing called ""legislation"" could used prevent people losing businesses asked shut government. also would shorter everyone participated. bad, really. 

And yeah. chose work office environment stability paying dividends days. I'll keep voting send money businesses, though. partner mother work healthcare that's relatively stable employment, too. edit: Plus way support local business ordering delivery three times week.

You open business, take risk. There's constitutional right successful business. Sometimes there's global pandemic hurricane. stores scared enforce masks. covid measure shutdown many businesses. Listen know something that's alright try teach what's going motherland. Yeah, luckily kids separate room computer. really felt bad coworkers kids running around yelling teams calls. Made head hurt 10 minutes, can't imagine 8 weeks felt like... EXACTLY Im at. Im memes entertainment Managed restaurant NYC. able pick day two different spots. impossible find anything winter back. I'll take anything right now. least four know gets reelected I’m unread, friend. president asks United states work together work together (or refuse.” ask...

You also always backdoor mandate via funding. See history 21 drinking age. I’m saying appropriate path, I’m saying President power broker financial leverage. Neither used even considered. “constitutional issue” cop referenced attempt work together kick ass He’s champion sun! worst i've seen post halloween trumper said neighborhood teach ""andy hitler"" lesson italy students need wear masks maybe somewhere else smarter! small businesses don’t resources prepare revenue month longer Relevant Username zombie apocalypse coming? seems pretty clear idea pandemic-level crisis fit worldview. real thing, quarter million US citizens dead also real. course received probably quarter million dollars health care illness, perfectly fine ego. least 40% population going flat refuse get vaccine anyway, I'm sure hoping best. guys can't even assed wear masks. this. amazed OP's bs great news shocking percentage US population truly honestly believes unsafe loaded racked gun reach times.

People need work live voted today happens nearly half country gets groomed conmen. link webinar well. way watch entire webinar. BIG MEATY MEN SLAPPING MEAT UK joining Belgium soon. ministers held Belgium example implemented tiered lockdown system. 

Stay safe buddy. Wishing best. Well, certainly lot people closing eyes right now, pretending exist. Well, least need carry piece paper leave house US. Restaurants non-essential businesses closed. Work continue via tele-work.  Universities shift online learning. Yeah website honestly place see people losing minds covid. grandma lunch outing friends day, old people especially don’t give shit. They're going blame deficit Democrats either way, guess appoint judges get richer. Totally willing part too. really wild bunch people never read book lives recreating 1918 flu pandemic almost perfectly. doubt multiple reasons. Another may simply better counting; though: Belgium undercounting deaths 25-50% like many countries are. idea Walmart right side history head exploding.   don’t think quite point comparing 1930s Germany, sure. 

If freedom speech freedom protest starts erode, i’ll believe you. don’t think you’d see BLM protests scale allowed 1930s Germany jewish. high population density areas lowest infection rates though... anything dumbasses thinking safe rural area cause problems us point feel like assholes going around without masks take one invasive nose tests yet.

I want safe spread disease around, absolutely, avoiding test one done strong motivator sit ass home instead going fun. Take him/her play nature (dirt/grass/forrest) away people. help bit stimulate immune system. Still lot bugs bacteria, far dangerous bug that's going around right now. 200 types cold anyway get one really build immunity next one. Since young people likely things - avoiding crowded - cancelling postponing social recreational - avoiding restaurants

It's exactly surprising. Although amount may ""lack responsibility"" however want phrase it, think considered within context standard habits groups people first place. Say normal, non-pandemic conditions, 50% young adults go social event least week, 10% middle aged older people do. Even equal amount, say 75% socially conscious young adults old people change habits pandemic starts, still 5× young adults ignoring safety guidelines.

I think better format survey would less like 2 parts, one responders answer question according pre-pandemic behavior one responders answer question according post pandemic behavior. would show much groups changed due pandemic reveal social habits general. disagree, want misinformation floating around. Misleading title, work = public services, essential services construction workers &amp; farmers arguing semantics. question is, good anyone. First wave, third wave, gives shit (adapted Happy Gilmore)? anyone good label waves matter slightest. ready go back gym NY boy miss it. Bought Peloton managed get Powerblocks normal price opened gyms around country. I'll try 2021. 

Not much worried - live home right mom sister always worried bringing home Nothing political virus. care vote for. guess means 99% people refuse obey Dr. Fauci. *good* thing? Oceania Great theory, horrible practice. sure many times needs proven. Dude, said worse. Thank lord position power. heard someone CNBC morning say (Americans) wearing masks forever now. interviewer asked, ""Even multiple effective vaccines?"" said, yes, even 100% got it, would still wear masks like South Korea China......I see it, frankly. think VAST VAST majority people stop wearing mask get vaccine shot. know people say takes weeks kick 100% effective. I'm realistic. better worse, China. share culture. wont wear “freedom”

This nothing people wear masks. excuse that's used fact. wear masks either think hoax think big city liberal disease affect them. HUH School work continue? bring almost change... John Cusack help us That's enough consequence others. Strangers sight, mind. 

Millions pass homeless everday disappear, one cares. stranger dies, people care. understanding exactly point lockdown. can't stop virus like inevitably spreading amongst population, slow significantly order health system cope therefore reduce overall deaths.  could gotten control? 

You know, they've saying since April. 

Contact Tracing, Social Distancing, Mandatory Masks, Rapid Testing. know, stuff Trump Administration Republican party REFUSE implement. 

The Fact nothing closed Summer Virus still Schools opened back September wonder there's sudden Increase Virus Outbreaks US. 

If actually LISTEN scientists like Dr. Anthony Fauci first place could actually holiday season. Covid 19. mutate one fucking time. You’re going set us back another 7 months research time I'm saying that's reports go. one contracted chickenpox twice child due mild first infection, maybe may effect prevalence subsequent reinfections covid? Cyberpunk 2077 trying keep pace vaccine. constitutionally viable. Wear mask, vote president warned us pandemic ready pandemic, socially distance tell folks stay inside listen scientists change deleted comment contained errors. Thats referring to. didnt reply me. Give break.

There one well signalled speculation rest comment entirely factual. 'Cuse go buy us alcohol. 🍻 Open everything save economy! government cannot able stop people gathering homes.

The government able stop people gathering homes, unwilling takes. takes nation-wide declaration marital law, soldiers every street, arrest anyone outside home without permit. one wants happen. Florida. Wtf?!!?? even possible  Unfortunately on/off switch though. see true benifits another year point.  Mad respect Dr. Fauci recently say EUA Nov-Dec starting vaccinate health care workers end 2021? swear changes mind every week That' r/ShitAmericansSay gold Wishing complete rapid recovery. Nope. Different studies. CDC 21 AAP therefore difference deaths. Well, hear we've beaten pandemic... what's worry? /s  damn you!! bible CLEARLY says crutches exist help us stand cannot pull bootstraps stand own!!! hehehe :P First, come back actually retracted, ""retract watch"" thing never thing.

Second, math, making good assumptions constructing model nothing like 1+1=2, 100-99=1. reason modeler making assumptions literally UNKNOWNS many factors. even math unknowns? Claiming math dishonest say least.  proud smug cruelty arent you? hope remember emotional state feel scoffing people way learn feels look inevitable death face Wishing complete rapid recovery.  default bill rights constitution, didn’t write regard feelings. isn’t *my* rights either, it’s every human’s rights.

This absolutely nothing feel, everything feel. basis argument solely feelings, seems pretty selfish me.

In closing, I’d like point hypocrisy stance again:

“Do say you’re sociopath!” - Obviously Sociopath Except virus nearly deadly enough act natural selection. Basically impossible die covid-19 young enough reproduce. proud smug cruelty arent you? hope remember emotional state feel scoffing people way learn feels look inevitable death face Wishing complete rapid recovery. COVID lame, change mode easy. Nope. Different studies. CDC 21 AAP therefore difference deaths. great thing libertarianism weld apartment. default bill rights constitution, didn’t write regard feelings. isn’t *my* rights either, it’s every human’s rights.

This absolutely nothing feel, everything feel. basis argument solely feelings, seems pretty selfish me.

In closing, I’d like point hypocrisy again:

“Do say you’re sociopath!” - Obviously Sociopath  That’s.... really sad. China crushed virus   Social distancing negative thing. Today got kevin harassing another one employee taking job covid guidelines seriously.

From told, kevin approached touching shoulder immediately employee took steps back get 6ft. Immediately kevin get pissed employee.

I walking around sales floor job kevin apporoach saying: “ manager? fucking dumb ass needs fired. ran away me. fire him”

Inside head “ oh boy kevin”, took steps back social distancing walk backwards immediately “ fucking dumb bitch! bitch me. doctors told sucking cures covid would it. Fuck you, place, hope business fail.”

Look, social distancing team effort. Hell super easy dont want dont, people social distance you. Maybe states stop voting people literally believe science. Yep, majority family mentality.  kidding. likely nothing corona, everything fallout election. won’t pretty, think, regardless wins. Southwest Florida checking in... you’d never know going pandemic here. 

Business usual people packed bars/ restaurants hardly masks.  great thing libertarianism weld apartment please.  Public shaming 100% correct history prove right.

You guys may like hey, think downvote anyone different opinion you.  6 months ago thought I'd never agree position, seeing lots cowering action get ahead thing... fuck it.  Except virus nearly deadly enough act natural selection. Basically impossible die covid-19 young enough reproduce.  Don’t worry. Flippant dismissiveness anything inline previously held biases hallmark doomer genus. Made minds scared nothing going change it. 70% Australians live one 4-5 major cities. Density definitely lower much rest world - obviously pop tiny comparison - pretty darn localised major hubs.

I'd say big point generally we've followed covid safety/compliance neighbors Asia rather Europe/ US without many hiccups. another poster said, (small) anti-masker groups stuff, pales comparison generally people taken serious. Sydney, we've living essentially normally since July-ish. majority people see grocery store etc still masked even though 1 case yesterday city pop 5.23 million, people we're bummed one case we've trend zero's lately. Also, contact tracing exemplary squashed potential outbreaks nearly soon begin. 

Add that, unique situation: island continent isolated own, closed borders, obviously helped lot. Also, well international borders, closed state borders clusters travel accross country. state Victoria even closed borders major city, Melbourne, rural part state quell spread outbreak city. meant life pretty much back normal now, apart Melbourne obviously, people sacrificed lot done amazing job quelling outbreak - peak around infection per capita Lombary - within touching distance eradicating virus again. Additionally, I'm sure free healthcare helped- testing free, quick, anxiety costs testing, care get sick, etc, probably helped people coming forward get testing- we've generally high testing numbers though dipping bit now. Govt provided livable social security net people effected/ work virus (including me!) since around start pandemic disincentivized people going work sick etc. 

I hope message come across rubbing in, meant all! trying give context unique situation steps we've taken helped us. We've incredibly lucky, mourn everyone rest world still dealing large outbreaks horrors covid, hope join semblance normalcy time soon. Trump's response criminal caused US irreparable damage. best friends north.  I'm well aware AIER's....leanings.

that said, paper contains pretty embarrassing error caught someone going press.

i somehow doubt 75 percent people ""always"" wear mask going public.. im sure much really changes legal moral issue system.

They told legal country...? legal right expectation privacy public.

That's government pulling credit card smartphone data. Lol deadline keeps getting pushed back 😅 Public shaming likely end curing effective vaccines treatments UV air treatment ever becomes ubiquitous thing I'm sure say dugout night anyway, already exposed... what's another hour two celebrating.

F Dodgers. gonna happen considering people get virus. Except virus nearly deadly enough act natural selection. Basically impossible die covid-19 young enough reproduce. everyone’s experience, high school real world people aren’t fully grown graduate Well, hear we've beaten pandemic... what's worry? /s  Mandating *clothing* unethical? hope English isn’t first language confusion result that... Honest question , american? think society function absoluyte hellscape describe? 6 months ago thought I'd never agree position, seeing lots cowering action get ahead thing... fuck it. Mandating *clothing* unethical? hope English isn’t first language confusion result that... Assuming national mandate holding relief funds hostage unless mandate would likely viewed unconstitutional(federal lockdown) would violate 4 5? 6 months ago thought I'd never agree position, seeing lots cowering action get ahead thing... fuck it. That’s... really sad. Assuming national mandate holding relief funds hostage unless mandate would likely viewed unconstitutional(federal lockdown) would violate 4 5? I'm fine way states handling it. virus going disappear must face it. wear mask, wash hands, social distance. However hospitals start become overwhelmed may want consider another lock down. doubt happen though America. Wishing everyone best difficult time I'm happy still job many people lost theirs. Stay safe. That’s... really sad. 6 months ago thought I'd never agree position, seeing lots cowering action get ahead thing... fuck it. Sounds like Reno 911 quote 2020 masks places

Voluntary mandatory? going say same. DFW experiencing second wave model projections Houston experience same. definitely harder measures get germany next week Yeah bro, US _definitely_ worse North Korea, completely valid take champ. Think typing say Day day life really much different Canada. watch much media. get shit media they’ve convinced us we’re bunch hateful, racist people well. 

It’s people’s heads, turn internet media month you’ll quickly realize. America never lockdown. repeat America never lock anything close one nationwide. happened several states banning stuff like indoor dining significant periods time. testing, better protocols hospitals ( ventilators unless ABSOLUTELY necessary, cpap style machines less damaging lungs ).

We're finding milder cases.

As death rate, stay low long hospitals fill up. Pneumonia deadly. Remain seen much leeway companies given telework, french managerial culture notoriously opposed it. Macron emphatic work continue. denying care means whole lot dead, shit killed otherwise.

Dead people buy much. Dead people pay much taxes. Dead people turn gears economy.

Tons people scared fucking shitless overrun hospitals going go skiing. going buy shit. fucks economy.

And COVID patients pay enough keep hospitals afloat... make up?... almost 40 million deaths? 1/10 covid positive people die? would say that? find source confirming remote working mandatory. one?
During first lockdown, companies making documents employees come offices even jobs done remotely. Known troll Well, luxury getting virus incarcerated. nothing wrong opening did. continue treat seriously population. country going stay locked year shutdown help now. I’m “anti lockdown” people aren’t getting disease businesses school. gathering homes, going weddings, funerals, game day parties. government cannot able stop people gathering homes. end goal move Netherlands, actually, use Italy gateway, part EU.  Thank admitting return normal point lol complains US thinks China potential nice place live 😂 Yeah, lowkey jealous guys. Guess always suck-start 9mm. new normal look like 2019 normal minor changes (masks places like planes, nursing homes doctor offices, attention health hygiene) probably emphasis social collective actions need prevent future pandemics arise something climate change respect permanent emigration, depends willingness learn languages.

Want stick strictly English? you’ll stuck Five Eyes nation handful others. Many countries (Spain, example) actually test Spanish comprehension.

After it’s function language (and therefore country) offers visa program you’ll able take advantage. suggesting Sweden wouldn’t find lot cases testing tripled? 

You don’t think Denmark find bigger share cases Sweden? mission complicated banner? Yeah, Fauci's fired. 

You can't go Trump right says he's ended pandemic, couple days signs executive order enabling fire Fauci."
