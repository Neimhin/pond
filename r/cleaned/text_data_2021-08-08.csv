Probably Fox weeks. simply possible track infections mild nobody gets tested. denominator equation small skew result extreme.

Please watch video. misunderstanding me. Many states specifically banned business able check vaccinate status. area Texas, Mississippi, Alabama etc seeing public putting vaccine status check. 

Regarding restaurant checking vaccinate status, mostly political statement point. recently article LATimes 20 restaurants/bars checking proof vaccinate status. 25k+ restaurants Los Angeles alone. Considering many restaurants financially can't turn away customer, seeing putting check someone vaccine status. 

Regarding last statement, almost one arrested/fined making false card/using it. reality is, making cards easy, catching someone uses hard. could probably make one home around 30 minutes novice this. state run vaccination site New Hampshire. military guys checked us confirmed identity asked. doctor actually gave jab didn‚Äôt say anything. Ok sure, isn‚Äôt right? Like it‚Äôs ‚Äújust go get vaccine‚Äù thing \+1000, seems like officials complete total denial.

Either want get rid covid force everyone get vaccine.

Or don't, accept going get new variants cases forever.

But currently want cake eat too, covid disappear let people infect others. go Austin quick family trip (one member go).

I already booked flights. read paper am. shit show. people traveling masking. pretty sad. yes, there's 14 day quarantine flu would baseline suggesting get 50k deaths per year need quarantine. 

there also 14 day quarantine bad flu years maybe 100k 150k year might max stop quarantine Maybe, extremely difficult manage pandemic. Clearly whole world botched pandemic. Many countries different approach virus can't override decisions.

Variants going happen unless every single country locked beginning everyone complied. going happen - human behavior. different better worse times means people think differently. less likely we'd many variants knew early virus would spread based contagious .,  c go gym still wear mask please. Vaccines reduce risk perfect. even close Lyme? haven‚Äôt even started school yet Delta actually isn‚Äôt resistant vaccines. It‚Äôs main issue variant appears reproduce spread quickly throughout body, much vaccinated may still get symptoms body builds response (though vaccinated able build response much quicker unvaccinated). 

The higher anti-body count would come third shot would theory provide better protection delta, especially since anti-bodies fade time.  Fucking idiots this? That's serious overstepping. please get second dose soon wait. next tuesday. mean... Theres thousands people who've died due vaccine along would probably disagree vaccine kill them, that's them.

Ah, denial strong. especially country without public health care. 

As far aware, vaccine 100% free, questions asked, every person 12 country. rofl matter one multiple? either kids don't.

Shit shit shit fuck. here. kid supposed start kindergarten fall. Last year lost job, kid lost year preschool, isolated, skipped birthdays/holidays, lost friendships due people selfish, spent hundreds dollars masks, vaccinated immediately. enough deluded selfish pricks there, including ones family, pandamic kept rolling along. thinking earlier. interesting fact conveys magnitude impact nation back then, hope people use comparison downplay current pandemic. like lives today 1/3 valuable then. lol americans Actually main incubators new covid strains historically immunosuppressed‚Ä¶

Let get right that. want really know, full FDA approval actually mean vs now. hear single compelling argument real difference. gone, unusable point.  good dirty tree killers.  Denmark lockdown start, politicians concerned public image didnt want something would get no-vax crowd riled still looking like took action something productive

Hence got weird rules like

You must use mask standing / walking bus, need use sitting seat 10 cm left right, people sitting half coughing complain ""feel"" breathing restricted mask need use it

And bars clubs allowed keep open close 22:00.. corona apparently way infectious night times drunk partying people go ""aight 22:00 o'clock, lets go home bed get good nights sleep guys!"" 

oh best one

just Christmas start December restricted size's stores allowed larger shopping centers could keep open, closing half city's shops forcing everyone flock together 3-4 shopping malls instead spreading city stores let manage amount people inside. 
but hey, shopping mall means big everyone space.. unless whole fucking city population there

fuck politicians knowing basic science dictating non-effective rules mentally deficient anti-vaxx howler monkey's fucking ""My Freedumbs"" ""reeeeeeeee guverment threatening human rights"" kind apartheid living place getting free education, healthcare right spout batshit crazy want..

Lack hospital care raise unknown factor, triage situation would never turn away kids. know added risk respiratory diseases time.

Measles around 1/1,000 causing several thousand deaths year. That's basically worst (and unlikely) case (though it'd everyone catching measles year, never happened).

We around 50 million under-12s US. 50% attack rate 1/20,000 mortality would 1,200 deaths.  Average annual death rates cohort around still lower background rates (if distributed full year). everyone needed continue wearing masks, vaccinated unvaccinated Delta hitting harder natural things might change COVID variants affect different groups time.

I believe really important parents idea risks COVID children, I've research recently assess risks. expert -- welcome comments -- thought may helpful parents navigate worrisome time:

**Morality Risks:** Obviously, there's extremely fine line walk here: every death child horrendously tragic, cannot imagine parent child died hospitalized. good news parents, however, mortality risks still remain low. [Out 74,000,000 kids U.S., 519 died COVID since crisis began (as July works mortality rate 0.0007%, 0.015% amongst confirmed cases COVID. Again, **immensely** tragic -- simply put, child die -- parent, I'd probably worried prospects long-term COVID symptoms (discussed below).

**Risks Delta:** Obviously, Delta new, still much know. However, data U.K (where Delta hit time now) gives us clues. [Let's start good news: based data U.K., kids remain least impacted age group long Despite access vaccines, kids age 5-14 still *by far* lowest hospitalization rates demographic (this past week, 1.08/100,000; kids age 0-4 noticeably higher rates -- 3.12/100k -- though still lower age group). Similarly, hospitalization rates kids never significantly exceeded U.K.'s prior peak (which occurred pre-Delta), least hopeful Delta fundamentally change COVID's risk profile *beyond transmissible*.

The bad news? know it, we're seeing now, Delta *insanely* transmissible. fact we're already seeing records hospitalizations amongst kids extremely bad, say least. fact already occurring indications cases nationally close peaking really troubling (An aside: U.K. never break record youth hospitalizations Delta we're breaking now? really know, anyone insight it'd interesting hear).

**Risks Long COVID:** still lots learn long COVID, Delta new enough current studies really address it. COVID generally, however, earliest studies suggested frighteningly high rates long-lasting symptoms (one even pegged third!). suffered immense methodological weaknesses, low sample sizes, parental-reported symptoms, probable selection bias, control groups.

More recent research (which perfect still includes many weaknesses, least somewhat better) suggested much lower rates first studies, albeit risks real. sampling recent work include:

* [In self-reported survey UK, 95% infected kids symptoms lasting longer four weeks, 98% symptoms 56 (and I'm understanding study correctly, analyzed kids symptomatic COVID, would lower rates infections).
* [In survey UK people COVID, estimated 7.4% children aged reported symptoms 12 weeks infection (this study included control group)
* [In one study control group, researchers found kids infected COVID Zurich actually likely report symptoms long-COVID kids clear: study imply long-Covid occur. However, true, suggests actual prevalence long-COVID kids likely quite low. (This definitely encouraging study found).

One last note: need careful discussing long-COVID differentiate symptoms bad manageable (and resolve time), symptoms debilitating. Unfortunately, understanding, current research really addressed adequately. last study least, common symptoms lasted children lasting symptoms 1) fatigue, 2) loss smell, 3) (to lesser degree) headaches. Even really resolve question -- depending levels fatigue, example, certainly debilitating -- think something really lose sight discussing long-COVID.

**Takeaways:** Obviously, people look data likely come different conclusions. me, look feel *somewhat* reassured -- there's zero risk (there's definitely not) what's currently happening absolutely tragic, data speaks somewhat lower risks impression I'd likely get spent whole day sub. again, I'm also parent. Others may look data (particularly long-COVID studies) still reasonably feel worried.

**In event -- know I'm preaching choir -- important thing protect kids around get vaccinated. happen parent children age 12 who's fence, please get vaccinated, too. It'll protect child truly nasty disease help lower risk around child, too.**  DeSantis, Abbott, and/or Trump variants.  government policy? Canada schools going back next two weeks so. also mask mandates schools, area ended testing, tracing, isolating sick individuals. going free right time schools open back up. one side American soldiers though. point it. Elderly vacinated. cases young people actually say type shit? sense humanity all. way people subreddit think worse anti vaxxers times. way woods got thrown right back in. bright side Delta spreads quickly burn population far quicker previous variants Unfortunately ""Me First"" society, benefit individual going work. think alternative, keeping things closed 0 risk contagious disease, simply possible.

Unfortunately, lot people failed understand unvaccinated individuals needed continue wearing masks ‚Äî misunderstanding can‚Äôt help think propagated least partly due comments like one made ‚Äî stopped wearing masks.

At time, Republicans argued Biden CDC Constitutional authority mandate mask usage, believe them, it‚Äôs like Biden CDC could really require masks anyway. hospitals like 18 months hire nurses. problem hospitals - start fining understaffing magically see find enough help.  Yep. It‚Äôs pretty bad likely get worse next month+. happens stubbornly call ‚ÄúTexas‚Äù ‚ÄúAlabama‚Äù variant. This. Even republicans watching Fox News vaccinated ones watch tv all. Yeah, also expecting lot more.

It‚Äôs least plus POTUS isn‚Äôt actively working burn everything ground‚Ä¶ could still done feel can't... articulate.... madness... must punch... concrete    Sure, understand. However, time sensitive issue regardless perceived importance paramount vaccinate mask 8 months ago.  Miracle, might even say...... still wear shirts shoes store, somehow THAT‚ÄôS ok!?! You‚Äôre right, doesn‚Äôt. can‚Äôt feel whole thing would‚Äôve already, everyone took seriously rest us. Louisiana data [their COVID fully vaccinated account 90% hospitalizations.

For additional context, state 37.6% total population vaccinated, fully vaccinated skew older (here's data weeks ago [percent fully vaccinated breaks age like pretty good protection given much vulnerable expect vaccinated population compared unvaccinated population based relative ages (i.e., without vaccinations I'd probably expect substantially 50% hospitalizations, instead they're 10%). That‚Äôs surprising. number means nothing itself.

If 100% vaccination rate, 100% covid cases break-through cases. what?

Antivaxxers trying use numbers say vaccines working. yet scientists already knew vaccinated people could still catch spread COVID, politicians CDC wanted open economy Compromised immune system? Thank can't put blame anyone unfortunatley. confirm, friends previously safe got vaccinated then, ""I part want live life."" skeptical self still hermiting home, trusting CDC. couple covid. Thanks.

*All world's doctors telling take shot*

Them (in redneck voice): ""I ain't takin' shit. know what's it. And, I, I, wanna go Applebees. wanna sit down. want take out. dont want punk-ass drive up, neither. KNOW RIGHTS!!!"" PCR highly specific test, lets determine virus eg covid.

RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus) nasty common respiratory illness, hospitalises many kids every year. Many regions seen uncharacteristic surges long opening up, presumed due lack normal exposure.

Paraflu like flu flu, another family respiratory illnesses.

You want let alone multiple time, even covid. Im sure Florida Supreme court overturn ruling. It‚Äôs *not* kind country live in. younger generations smarter. always are. empathy technology get things done better. many Americans died COVID every wartime fatality every war US ever in... Christ last time hear Blame doesnt help, unfortunately. wish comes easy. niece supposed go back in-person school coupl weeks, terrified Mom hoping something gives then. one getting choice, either go back :-( actually expect even 99.9999% rates stop spread, CDC admitted even vaccinated contract spread? think pandemic point going ever over. It'll basically like rest lifetimes. except long run, turns   educational. already happening. DeSantis I‚Äôm Florida blaming new wave deaths Biden‚Äôs immigration policy. east would follow! Many western countries 80%+ adult population least one dose already, yet sadly countries like Romania Bulgaria even 45% school shootings even compare covid? resume school next day. schools shut whole city state school shooting. toddler two still three. Everyone daycare does. Even parents drop pick up. point people need realize covid going away afraid live lives again. done festival demanded proof vaccines, would fine. That‚Äôs lot lifes saved :) Yup! anything summer improve ventilation systems? Nope! Unreal. Thank sharing. appreciate trying help. Thank you. making difference I‚Äôm thankful. second that.

(source: also live here) US #1 can't know certainty ""how"", happened weeks ago, oldest niece went Girl Scout camp event something, apparently masked whole time car way back home, think got it. Wth? Unfortunately, lot areas also seeing unseasonably high numbers RSV hospitalizations.  almost science saying one thing leaders need say something else fool people ""right"" thing. that's hard us sure. Homeschool round two... go... uhgg worries all. best buds infectious disease doctor got COVID unfortunately 2 weeks got shot. seems vary healthcare professional healthcare professional, official guidance get ASAP. reason say wait MCA studied yet. I'm sorry hear that. Companies preach day customers important, seem forget employees people too. üôÑ Thanks! sit coffee like 8am calmly went concerns thoughts. Im glad chose get shot.  help, forced back office last year. agonized decided try sending back daycare (cases really low last august state) extremely fortunate. class single (known) case family case year back. know others fortunate quarantine 2-3 times that. say, hope lost, may totally suck, understand feels hard. nervous delta. FWIW, daughter amazing year thriving daycare, moved 2 year old class started wearing mask time ( sees older kids it) . seen teacher's mouths still learning really well language developing great. got 2 doses Sinovac last month. I'm going try order Moderna soon, delivered next year probably. Reckon order 1 2 doses? That‚Äôs Desantis days ago deadly case case take look whole population. account people infected wouldn‚Äôt otherwise. 

It‚Äôs CFR IFR it‚Äôs total infections, total hospitalizations total deaths. Delta extending pandemic otherwise would ending. say UK less sophisticated vaccine?

UK Pfizer Moderna 40s, agreed vaccinating 16+ (although worried we're vaccinating 12years+ schools social distancing masks go back September) Nonsense? That's literally important information discovered clinical trials vaccine companies conducting. clearly idea process works reacting emotionally. Oh talking climate stuff

I know vaccine, quarantine, mask wearing shit works, climate shit ‚Äúdebated‚Äù decades scientists keep telling us years advance what‚Äôs going happen regularly category 5 hurricanes entire Pacific Northwest fire people surprised pikachu face still argue natural swing global temperatures ideal times currently I‚Äôm saying

For you, suppose. wife planned child right wanted to. Im countering ""can imagine kids right now"" questing. Cause yes, absolutely imagine believe Delta proving even current vaccines still spread amongst even vaccinated people

Which, everyone vaccinated, would much less serious situation. people requiring hospitalization ~97% unvaccinated. Take 3% vaccinated, sufficient hold back Delta, maybe double 6%, even 10%, still bad situation moment.

Being vaccinated strongly improves chances requiring hospitalization. That's message getting shared enough.   know history ""hour people"" better anyone else. Tales passed mama source factual information. perspectives opinions. Please use word ""fact"" context 

Is mama respected historian? No? I'm interested third hand tales things never happened anyone knows.

What exactly bad behavior mine? Getting vaxinated? Telling people allow antivaxxers make excuses based on....nothing? 

 Sorry fell lies. Bit reality people getting vaccinated want to. making excuse avoid mockery terrible ideas actions Like DJ Khaled says, ‚ÄúAnotha One‚Äù think 5 2 year olds could pass. mention kids getting it, bringing home.

Yea schools remote. Maybe judge volunteering. send them, safe. like parachute example. jump plane butt naked there's 0.1% chance parachute might fail. 

Also Americans hate mask much. simple thing keep alive, might little uncomfortable summer come on, us even hot know parents lied kids ages get vaccinated. don‚Äôt check ID Walgreens CVS. right mind volunteer mess? Politicians top brainwashed people wallow mess want nurses clean up? Good luck that. know parents lied kids ages get vaccinated. don‚Äôt check ID Walgreens CVS. single biggest step country take full FDA approval coinciding current surge.  


Most major employers schools tolerate current status quo forced mandate vaccination.  


I cannot think bigger boost vaccination numbers insurance carriers requiring proof vaccination coverage avoid significant cost increases. I'm sure legality political laws need changed. Almost 400 children die drowning every year well. idea get covid deaths zero pure fantasy speaks true true here, basic science... essentially walking petri dishes viruses breed in. people breeding, chances mutations. Ironically antibiotics effective. bugs mutating getting stronger.  survey showing much against? Genuinely asking. Honestly... Nobody sees it. radar.  year covid, people never seen coverage looks like struggle/die it. abstract concept, think makes easy people dismiss, either consciously subconsciously. clarify! going continue homeschooling. things looking better enrolled public school moving across country husband's work. numbers started trending wrong direction mask mandate decided pull them. also wonder truancy. admin talked school going send said enrollment they're trying bring back up. idea that's issue truancy parents seeking alternative schooling options guess issue places. Johns Hopkins myth vs fact It‚Äôs shame. saw thread local FB group asking parents felt comfortable sending kids back Sept did, saying kids didn‚Äôt get sick/don‚Äôt die virus.

Even *was* true (which clearly not, unfortunately), still pass along others. overall liberal, pro-vax state. Maybe spent year telling everyone kids get covid get sick... realize vaccine side effects, right? They're bad virus still volunteering ill days week. That's pretty substantial loss income, therefore ""free."" always time. comes patient safety, one missed thing equal lost lives. That's opposite FDA supposed do. research, expected confirm research performed performed correctly idiots believe vaccines they're gasping oxygen ER.

You realize single person can't stop pandemic, even president US? teamwork. even bother open link. Otherwise you'd've seen federal case. know parents lied kids ages get kids vaccinated. don‚Äôt check ID. church! Still here. They're ones complaining media gall report factual numbers breakthrough infections now. Guessing means Buku: Planet B next. It‚Äôs supposed 2 weeks this. 1,450 seem like huuuuuge number given many kids US. wonder percentage compares adults.

Obviously kids hospital horrible, even much preventable. people talk kooky therapeutics, 100% fine. know understand going through. I‚Äôm sorry. Please seek help. Join support group. Please seek help professionals also join support group people similar situation. Please seek help. Take care. I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm kids, brother wife one October. It‚Äôs ideal times currently I‚Äôm saying forgot switch accounts Closer 8b (7.8). Yeah, I‚Äôm sure person arguing besides possibly understand ‚Äúaerosols‚Äù are. 

All I‚Äôm hoping people realize masks indeed help reduce spread. Droplets aerosols alike. 

Yeah, aerosols pose threat take multiple precautions - get vaccinated, wash hands, etc.  imagine Greek! Maybe make instead couple crazy cat ladies read Astral language, maybe every 4 year old could use ask parents pull finger! CDC quite literally said opposite.  matter, every state September. swear, five years ago almost every Reddit thread topic still felt like insight slice life, viewed private thoughts anonymous peers.

Now? Pfffft. almost typed 38 different hypotheses changed, realized sound crazy blowhardy. don‚Äôt know, though, it‚Äôs worse now. drowning logical fallacies misinformation. mean- theres really way look guess 18 includes grade school aged youth. Please don‚Äôt talk like that, even you‚Äôre joking. may change paths completely different way expected, life over. future version look back glad didn‚Äôt give felt like should. know thought way well. I‚Äôm glad didn‚Äôt give now.  death count severe enough he‚Äôd shut back down. Right it‚Äôs 40-50 day entire state that‚Äôs almost exclusively unvaccinated people. virus mutates see large numbers deaths vaccinated population, that‚Äôs we‚Äôd end another shutdown masks, vaccines, listening nutters internet‚Ä¶

This inevitable. worn mask least 3 months. mask mandate anywhere near (in Northernish state). zero reason wear one. result identity politics eating itself?  child way 2 months couldnt excited. Quit cynical  10 hours. I'm guessing they're trying twist fit opinion. Well, used thing Germany still significant lockdown measures. example, vaccinated people exempt gathering limits, allowed meet unlimited numbers. also need test eat restaurant etc.

Now strict measures all, there's lot ""bonus"" vaccinated people. skip mandatory testing travel live (maybe situation different parts Germany). that, things allowed everyone.

As case numbers growing right now, may soon see stricter measures Germany might see freedoms vaccinated people. matter, need live it.

As long hospitals overwhelmed go blaming individuals (parents) again, many trying survive system. 

Did getting vaccine end pandemic? No? almost individual action actually means nothing without collective action top it? human beings able completely manage collective, need types authority accountability. Absolutely fascinating continue talk people get vax parroting propaganda ourselves. Yes, law really get choice.  True. I'm lucky like bars, anyway!  No. HM, counting 18 under, 18? article even says ""under 18"" goes pediatric care. Absolutely yes. ask doctor immunized, feel pressure patients get vaccinated. BTW; emergency doctor going listen healthcare professionals conspiracy nutters?

With vaccines would alive. Yes us you‚Äôre ok idea transmitting potentially deadly infectious disease innocent people around you, you‚Äôre simply sociopath. I‚Äôve never particularly scared covid - I‚Äôm young extremely healthy horror story anecdotes little effect understand are. I‚Äôve followed guidelines religiously fuck would ok giving virus people catch it, even I‚Äôm going fine myself? That‚Äôs ok me. I‚Äôm even particularly empathetic person. I‚Äôm total fucking lunatic. would be, vaccines reduce risk death compared people age group, compared general population. 80 year olds, vaccinated takes risk death terrible still significant 95% less. sure. currently live outside city due cheaper rent (and would pay time). rent Manhattan affordable, I'd rather live there.

But complications converting terms power/water lines.  Why?  Friday people probably working. lower classes usually regular schedules.

Getting vaccinated still right thing often not, excuses excuses. obstacles employers accommodate people, suffer. pro-life. get covid already prior vaccination? told expect mild symptoms don‚Äôt see partisan issues, well sure are. - awesome! politicians publicly declare fully agree positive discrimination?  thank Korea! got supply KF94's stop wearing Delta surging. US moving public health private health end year. &amp; every person whatever think necessary protect health &amp; safety. 

Whether taking vaccine booster shots avoiding indoor dining using high-filtration masks, choice you. know really irks anti-mask crowd hate seeing ppl around take steps protect themselves. gotta gotta do. may malice. Arkansas governor reversed stance least seems based around overconfidence willful ignorance. comes immune system, nothing 100%. far know, previous infection provides level protection re-infection. Earlier studies showed comparable levels protection leading vaccines. may take time understand variants affect would assume decrease similar drop vaccine efficacy. Marje Green called banks ‚Äúcommunist companies‚Äù day. Wait till figures insurance.   ignorant perspective.

There zero need personal insults. didn‚Äôt insult you, rather asked question back claim. don‚Äôt expect one, would appreciate apology. 

As parent young children, I‚Äôm keeping close tabs status timeline vaccine children, impact decision-making. aware [this AAP (PDF file) dated four days ago (Aug 5th) FDA. Coupled [this NBC news three days ago (Aug 6th), interpretation that: 

(1) earliest data children 5-11 years old drug manufacturers next month (September). there, FDA wants *additional* 4-6 months trials (whereas two months adult trials).

(2) AAP wants FDA limit 2 months additional trials, based concerns re: Delta variant unlikelihood significant issues reported 2 months.

(3) AAP National spokesperson stated **they don‚Äôt currently know** children need (size dose, number doses, timing doses), **they haven‚Äôt seen data**.

Your comments seemed suggest and/or grouping pediatricians pushing FDA approve vaccine **now** children 12, certainly AAP suggesting. source suggests otherwise, I‚Äôm happy take look it, provide it.  guys...actually want come right now? It‚Äôs kind shitshow. Yes, trust scientists pediatricians Bay Area dumb-dumbs. Well that, plus summer tourism studies required. plain common sense.

You need stop attitude. happen right going wrong lot things too.

That's rational people operate. Rational people wear masks there's studies show working. 

people also use ""common sense"" say masks work. Hospitalizations better metric lower lag deaths. Good. really pisses dumb ass antivaxers filling hospital beds may needed someone responsible thing got vaccinated need care. callous opinion, decided get vaccine, end full hospital someone else needs bed, dump street. sounds horrible, slightly less horrible telling someone massive heart attack stroke, sorry, room you. you‚Äôre French citizen, email consulate they‚Äôll set pass sanitaire. 
I‚Äôve reading reports Americans showing CDC cards pharmacy leaving pass within 5 min free. Totally. made sense us keep jobs (wfh foreseeable) get nanny -- area, cost nanny wind much day care anyway. going interesting see uptake like amongst toddlers... [Think might better campaign slogan, point. holdouts might traditionally / stereotypically speaking also pro children conservatives.

I however continuing lose faith elected officials keep control this. far I'm concerned people turned tide covid - wore masks distanced long enough however happened (whether time cronyism) vaccines produced, got vaccinated. us getting booster shots us keep infection.

I see government tv persona/tv host talking us reality tv episodes. anything mostly toothless background noise. Sure, area health authorities (I live Bay Area) SCIENTISTS PEDIATRICIANS saying kids back school risks worth reward.

Do listen science science?

Cool, sacrifices. who's going pay sell home move somewhere cheaper? Who's going take care wife's patients leave area since need incomes? Super easy say this, dude. Much harder do.  idiots, they're selfish shit too. Wondering drug works SARS-COV-2 - dissolving outer lipid membrane virus?  Ok, stop locking young thin vaccinated people quarantine old? is, unfortunately, nuance that‚Äôs lost many Americans. There‚Äôs also notable lack in-depth discussion ethics morality, even classes supposed explicitly topic, it‚Äôs often looked rather restricted context. instance, engineering ethics required take covered ‚Äúobvious‚Äù cases like Tacoma Narrows, far recall (this like 12-15 years ago) wasn‚Äôt *anything* exploring analyzing ethical ramifications building something (e.g. military industrial, social media, adtech). Actually er always triage true.

From read, get temporary immunity covid, diminishes time.

I think anyone really understands immunity works thing right much information misinformation hard know think. much I'm pro vaccine want pandemic over, regulations cannot pass due Grundgesetz, Article 3, specifically forbids kind segregation.

I really hope find solution.  Even it‚Äôs confirmed, children admitted respiratory distress still troubling.  anyone else notice pro-vaxxers sounding eerily similar COVID deniers/people playing covid last year? ""seems like"". That's *exactly* is. Vaccines reduce risk death vs. unvaccinated people age. COVID increases risk death proportionately across age cohorts. increase risk death 20% 10-20 year olds that's small number extra deaths. increase risk death 20% among 70-80 year olds that's lot deaths. increase risk death 20% age group, COVID (these example numbers) gonna find average age death COVID average life expectancy. thing politicians Germany hoped self responsibility instead vaccination program slowed crawl. Let's remember though, number way unbalanced developed countries vs undeveloped. try get vaccine NA Europe, etc. 350 children died COVID since start pandemic millions children negatively impacted missed schooling, social isolation, many cases, death parents understand FDA recently worked Pfizer Moderna double number children ages 5-11 years included clinical trials COVID-19 vaccines. appreciate prudent step gather safety data, urge FDA carefully consider impact decision timeline authorizing vaccine age group. view, rise Delta variant changes risk-benefit analysis authorizing vaccines children. FDA strongly consider authorizing vaccines children ages 5-11 years based data initial enrolled cohort, already available, continuing follow safety data expanded cohort post-market setting. approach would slow time authorization critically needed vaccines 5‚Äì11-year age addition, FDA continues evaluate clinical trial requirements children 5 years, similarly urge FDA carefully consider impact regulatory decisions delays availability vaccines age group. Based scientific data currently available COVID-19 vaccines, well 70 years vaccinology knowledge pediatric population, Academy believes clinical trials children safely conducted 2-month safety follow-up participants. Assuming 2-month safety data raise new safety concerns immunogenicity data supportive use, believe sufficient authorization age group. Waiting 6-month follow-up significantly hinder ability reduce spread hyper infectious COVID-19 Delta variant among age group, since would add 4 additional months authorization decision considered. Based evidence 340 million doses COVID-19 doses administered adults adolescents aged 12-17,as well among adults 18 older, biological plausibility serious adverse immunological inflammatory events occur two months COVID-19 vaccine administration Oh totally get bad actor. love pointing false narratives lol There's way still August 2021 try prod people obviously correct thing 1.5 years now?

If someone kept crossing street refused look ways kept day day point looking around using lights might keep painful death severe lifelong injury, say ""eh happens happens"" casually suicidal. life means nothing them.

Anyone wearing mask August 2021 casually suicidal give wide berth take well. Let go, choice die painfully. innocent victims except maybe children. back square one. progress lost.

It might feel way but, weeks away full vaccine approval schools much better equipped remote learning, although personally feel in-person ideal possible. 

Not like last year people hand-sewing masks, vaccine available, schools scrambling get schools remote-ready. 

I can‚Äôt wait til kids school like got experience young. Hopefully, get soon. Yep, it‚Äôs lot trial error finding well-fitting masks kids. 

The best masks I‚Äôve found really little kids (toddler/preschool) vistaprint masks filters. Still looking around options, though, littlest start wearing masks soon. we‚Äôre going anywhere, to, I‚Äôd want best fitting best filtering option could find. Right. Completely understand thread Texas. 
Glad school districts stupid.

Something going come head sick children fall-winter southern states trying macho virus.
Lesigh. It‚Äôs still enough. need capability ramp production billion doses per month more. Even rate would still take half year hit global herd immunity pandemic. yeah, course do. piece cloth. bother all. never near schools.

That gets point though. decision alone go club concert. There's potential ramifications wearing mask isn‚Äôt going make put one on.

Yes, that's true. However, continue wear masks crowded areas helps prevent spread virus.

Anyway, thanks conversation. nice talk something normal, calm manner without one parties involved getting pissed rude point. rare event internet seems. 100% sympathize you. exact situation. Im exhausted this. Let die off. sure ethical constraints stop lot RCTs occurring

Yeah, would little hard ethically justify Covid-infected person exhale faces people without masks. find one study, dig link necessary, used hamster model study mask use could reduce infection. ended recommending studies, findings suggestive positive benefit masks, particularly source control.

Given reasonably large numbers asymptomatic Covid carriers, universal masking probably helped least somewhat.  country public health care irrelevant vaccine free anyone wants insured not. you‚Äôre lucky enough area like faith protocols established see reason doubting decision. area unfortunately safe protocols non existent.

I also covid vaccine, side effects anthrax worse covid shot. 

They suck deal. Funny enough looked military vaccine record last 12 years . 32 entries! half flu second doses though. Still lot! Hell, yes. 

I work high-risk patients. Vaccination ""personal choice"", part caring patients. cannot read Hebrew either figures speak themselves. 

I think fully know reason, although age likely factor, fact decreasing effectivity seen progression indicate waning immunity main factor immune escape variant. guidelines based high number elderly immunocompromised vaccinated (per article). 

What stood me: 
Denmark‚Äôs guidelines stricter Texas! student tests +, anyone within 1 meter radius 15 minutes notified need quarantine. it‚Äôs something like music class,the distance extended 2 meters. K√≠nder classes, entire classroom. 

Texas: +classmate identified, school choice. choose either notify close contacts not. choose notify, it‚Äôs parents want send child back school quarantine. bars. gov run institutions. third moderna trial smaller dosage first two shots? covid November well Canada waited 6 months that's able get first shot.

Here recognize previous infection part fully vaccinated got 2nd pfizer shot 2 weeks ago. 8 months infection 7weeks doses. 

So ever booster shot needed would probably good. 

I wish States Canada would look recognize I'm saying 2nd shot anything thay really get much benefit someone never infection.

It could going someone else needs more. media vested financial interest keeping covid fears going They're ""golden standard"" reason! mean say look like 2019? Look summer: large crowds back pretty much everywhere, full stadium capacity back Euros, Lollapalooza US less attendance 2019, international travel still restricted somehow, vaccinated people already travel without quarantining countries.
Maybe mean might stick mask wearing? possible even bad thing I'm sure masks enforced forever, unless thing tricks sleeve Scientists rarely deal ""absolutes"". one things causing confusion among lay people. want sharp, defined, yes/no answers, science rarely going provide those.

My personal take ""some degree"" better ""zero degree"", wear mask.  actually do. pandemic started schools started remote learning, chanting ""Why close schools, far child died. Even get covid chance dying low"". stretch mentality roll new veriest. billions unvaccinated people world. chance vaccinated American reason variant incredibly low. enlisted, bunch mandatory vaccines including anthrax smallpox.

I also covid vaccine, side effects anthrax worse covid shot. 

They suck deal. may make headlines, articles get written. mostly find medical sites journals least. Somewhat early pandemic looking articles long flu viruses long effects counter someone saying ""tons viruses never go away, unusual"" find couple articles, way less common. Current data showing long-haulers 10%,  people downvoting reason we‚Äôre mess. Fauci saint, even close, narrative people linear chance deviation. Could raise rates unvaxed people? People realize right get others sick. may knowingly transmitting virus vaccination far less likely happen. vaccine passport least mandate.

People right kill others car collisions. may purposely causing collisions happen. ban non-essential travel least mandate.

People right commit violent crime, men commit 90%+ them. may criminal record, there's first time everything. mandate testosterone blockers men least mandate.

People right transmit misinformation, harm others words. may intentionally causing harm, happen communication pre-approved. private communication requiring prior approval government employee least mandate.

The thing that's blown point getting R 1 vaccines alone. Delta killed that, worlds inability contain it. Maybe Delta ""reining supreme"" variants one make Covid-19 seasonal. virus mutates vaccinated aren‚Äôt even protracted anymore. Which, nothing, going helping push along. That's fair enough.

Jesus: WTF! Yes, pressure them. Me! breakthrough cases marginal ‚Äî people unvaccinated really threaten themselves. I'm tired people saying want take vaccine we're trying violate freedom imposing rules freedom ones got vaccines ones suffering businesses ones locked forced shut Downs even prolonged longer idiots running around calling freedom they're infringing rights safety fucking freedom. That's assuming logical thought process accurately weighs consequences. Which, group people we're talking about, big assumption. Ooft. mean, look, I'm vaccine guy. Big fan them. mean, get second dose week day I've dreaming year now.

But, er... calling people ""un-american"" different belief (even agree belief) perceived threat you... er... mean. There's precedent exactly good look ones throwing term around. Well, options?

1. Leave things (***Non-action)***: palatable. people continue choose vaccinate, endangers children people allergic reactions vaccine, **and** increases chances another variant appearing. 
2. Vaccination mandates ***(Mandates)***: works, I'm understanding correctly. remember right, Biden looking mandating vaccinations people working federal positions, military. also illegal places businesses mandate it. 
3. Eliminate arguments vaccination ***(Persuasion, Education)***: Getting vaccine fully approved FDA instead emergency approval (in works), prove bullshit ""it literally magnetizes you"" argument (we saw well worked), continue educate mRNA vaccines work. slow, we're making progress. 
4. Reward system people vaccinate ***(Rewards)***: Proved quite useful earlier on. Done right, good incentive makes vaccination palatable eases fears. 
5. Insurance Underwriting update ***(Punishment)***: Punish people's wallets refusing vaccinate, making health insurance premiums higher. 

Any thoughts? vaccinated people go work symptomatic untested equally irresponsible. Funny state vaccinated socially distanced gain credibility. go write something fauci loose credibility subreddit haha. Feel like they‚Äôre gonna regret that.  regards vaccinations prevent variants: Since animals get infected can't variants manifest inside animal reservoir come back human population? mention globally vaccinations rates anywhere close 1st world countries time. IE trying stop variants futile. What's point? I'm simply saying sure, obesity risk factor. personally know multiple people currently hospital needing oxygen anywhere 20-45, overweight preexisting conditions. Taiwan. Government taking entire supply chain 50% postal workers switch work mask distribution. wonder long work. I'm surprised individual bars/restaurants/whatever let people whatever reasonably sound evidence show - want customers. supposed QR code wonder whether authorities start cracking that.  figure would notice change behavior even 2 yo can't explain precisely.  data many suspected deaths occurred vaccination? know incredibly rare difficult link vaccine, curious numbers. think share info including first shot allergic reaction, allergic reaction second one? sure, would interesting know. HIV example RNA virus exactly that. appreciate frightening linetoers (i.e. self-centered people 'don't wanna/don't feel like wearing mask') feel justified wearing one way 'well, masks work 100% wear it?' excuse. fact anti-maskers enjoy wielding. also true pointy stick distance, faced angry bear, may equiv double barrel shot gun AK-47 absolutely better barehanded human v. angry bear scenario.

FTFY  ""49.7% Americans fully vaccinated, 57.8% received least one dose.""

Explain makes 70%? You‚Äôd surprised many people can‚Äôt pass ASVAB test. It‚Äôs actually fairly difficult fully qualify depending service time need. sure that! might trade. Tell don‚Äôt kids without telling don‚Äôt kids. Sure, numbers equate that, doesn‚Äôt apply real life can‚Äôt generalized. Total breakthrough infections (mild ones) need recorded see protective vaccine hospitalization/death breakthrough infections occur severe breakthrough infections need compared that. Comparing number breakthrough infections warranted hospitalization vaccinated total doesn‚Äôt tell anyone anything meaningful cannot proven 164 million people significant exposure Covid (resulting either breakthrough infection vaccine protection). 

For instance, 130 million people couldn‚Äôt even caught Covid based lifestyle geographic factors/community spread, including stats bolstering shot efficacy misleading. I‚Äôm staying that‚Äôs true total, that‚Äôs example show I‚Äôm saying above. Every time country state tries that, end overwhelmed reversing course. also parroting number without really thinking it, thank correction. Overall agree, although don‚Äôt think either statistics discussed really give whole picture. comparison you‚Äôre referring indeed show vaccine effective preventing hospitalization/death infected(which great), doesn‚Äôt account accounting significantly decreased risk catching COVID first place vaccinated. Dumbest thing I‚Äôve read week‚Ä¶ guess. Biontech manufacturing capabilities size   haven‚Äôt wearing mask past year cases. wore mask got vaccine have. people need mask end pandemic ones part aren‚Äôt won‚Äôt.

Going forward, prefer vaccine mandates testing requirements unvaccinated get vaccinated good news brothers sisters used sharing beds Arkansas think child deaths get high? Oh dear, hope not. :( No, don‚Äôt know countries making live data available.

Hopefully bring visibility data. someone fully vaccinated, lives lives someone can‚Äôt get vaccine, especially interested knowing breakthrough rate. people try suppress info, downplay it, quite annoying. 

Initially mask got vaccine. lot cautious, always mask, due numbers. don‚Äôt fear health like know risks help combat spread protect people can‚Äôt vaccinated. spread it, obviously case, need adjust behaviors. mode thinking of. world currently playing virus. looks like medical professionals interviewed US studies referred UK stats. help?

ETA: here‚Äôs summary UK study cited article ‚Äú4.4 percent 1,734 children symptoms four weeks post-Covid, four times high percentage symptoms four weeks non-Covid illnesses like flu. 2 percent Covid patients symptoms eight weeks.‚Äù Could potentially get approval? Look Dear Pandemic Facebook. Today's post explains it. No, year ago, prospect vaccine even remotely helped hospitalizations deaths dream come true.
And 15 months ago, prospect vaccines within year seemed impossible.

The mRNA vaccines blew expectations water go far beyond expectations even Delta.

3-4 months ago something unbelievably great. today still do. hoping we‚Äôd switch system similar name hurricanes. Make list names work that. 

Press release: recent COVID variant, dubbed ‚ÄúWilla‚Äù today, meanwhile variant ‚ÄúMarly‚Äù still thousands hospitalized. rather mountains thinking God church thinking mountains. - John Muir Bar Probot rate Grohl all. wish I'd told good arm didn‚Äôt problems first dose even cross mind wonder what's gonna next? 

Planets? Food? Star Wars Characters?

""I'm sorry sir, got Chimichanga variant, infectious Chewbacca one I'm afraid"". Delta proving random mutation turned bad.

Can even comprehend I‚Äôm saying context entire discussion? entire point options, none involve us living level death forever. either kill massive number people, either develop fully effective vaccines, virus mutate less deadly infectious (which is, incidentally, happened flu). Actually that's million too, count sides: Oh god, please tell this. I've kept kids home 18 months. took time work. We're miserable, lonely need go back normal. 

I thought vaccine far away I'm worried. üòî variant emerged america? guess fucked treat Covid. Lock people, world closed. husband 63, high blood pressure, lost spleen 2017, diagnosed cancer last December. work around surgeries, got Moderna vaccines soon able Spring. family friends vaccinated little side effects know four people died Covid vaccine available. spleen could possibly make Covid infection worse you, know terrified husband last year. Please consider family. Ahhh, Boss Hogg. Got it. Makes sense. would thought? pandemic end, rate maybe next year, Covid stay. Eventually everyone resistance it, either vaccinated gotten covid. Even continue mutate, novel virus anymore people get sick mild case immune system exposed it. pretty much happened flu. many people die meantime big question. Thanks. earlier comment pointed data source added edit point out. Seems point factors vaccination rate covid mortality rate among black though. Watch video CPAC speech literally says ‚Äúeverybody get shot‚Äù.

Doesn‚Äôt seem matter :( critical understand proportion cases/hospitalizations/deaths vaccinated people *a function ratio vaccinated:unvaccinated, function vaccine effectiveness*.

Imagine 1000 people, 80% vaccinated. Imagine 5% chance getting infected unvaccinated, 0.5% chance getting infected vaccinated.

Based numbers, vaccine 90% effective, population, you‚Äôll 10 unvaccinated people get sick (200x0.05), 4 vaccinated people get sick (800x0.005). would ‚Äú28% new cases among vaccinated people‚Äù, it‚Äôs obvious see effective vaccine is.

Tl;dr get vaccinated Machine learning Idk. didn‚Äôt notice bruising jab didn‚Äôt hurt vaccine I've taken. soreness first dose whereas went away like 2 days second felt way like week bursitis started acting bad past. 

Before second shot mobility like 90% percent mild pain sneezed bumped something alternates 45% 70% mobility pain/discomfort pretty much time. Taking aleve used help lately anything can't rehab exercises hang pullup bar used help lot too.

Besides bursitis getting worse side effects far I'm aware. even feel sick anything hope feel better soon! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs mild. We‚Äôre currently Civil War death range 620,000-850,000 deaths. Schools already opening South thought? Good job, China So, anyone try get third shot? use fake name? USA, drive another state? good message, right idea - entirely accurate.

If *really* want halt next mutation, look planet whole. Delta originated India, know. Right now, US passed 70% mark getting everyone first shot. 

If there's going another barn-burner mutation -- it'll come one poorer countries. large population, poor education healthcare, vaccinated. 

That's ought worried about. 

Yeah, bummer percentage Americans believe science. focus entire rest world might actually able vaccinate? unknown contender Dave Grohl coolest rocker ever? know really asked for, question led quick rabbit hole. looked news articles within last seven days reporting percent patients unvaxxed. stopped nine articles, basically agree. Across articles linked below, 95 % patients unvaxxed average. cover large sample size.

Delta proving wrong right now. Children hospitalized whereas barely got sick Alpha. long keep letting roll dice mutation lottery... put title though, intentionally misleading people think there's new variant spreading.

A better title would something like, ""why scientists call Delta Goldilocks variant"".

Even original title indicated Goldilocks reference Delta. would love stay home I‚Äôm sick wouldn‚Äôt bankrupt me. lot lower income Americans simply don‚Äôt luxury. likely know, trying push authoritarian angle going cause people dig harder. Cambridge-educated solicitor anti-vaxxer. hope so. gradual thing, one-and-done thing. We're already past point severe consequences. think we're going extinct 10 years.  Honestly stores ask vaccination proof force wear mask ask it. I'm boat, got j&amp;j delta taking hold (I'm agoraphobic finally got nerve leave house go get it) they're saying almost nothing. I'm still wearing mask everywhere go, want get mRNA booster sure, since low vax rate almost one wears mask anymore. That‚Äôs problem - ‚Äúyou need actually read.‚Äù Americans stupid. didn‚Äôt moving goal posts people hesitation. 

The vaccines effective stopping spread Covid initially reported. Doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt work, give protection, sold doing. should‚Äôve LOT conservative estimates effectiveness rush reopen drop mask mandates. doesn‚Äôt matter. Washington Post trying scare people headline mentioning delta. I‚Äôm cancelling subscription them. clickbait headlines often.  Okay, like‚Ä¶.how that? I'm US, but... rough around am. Hospital health department take awhile, people end pay get rapid test. One people department got tested, probably around Wednesday Thursday, still heard back. She, luckily, salary, rest us hourly. quarantine, need get back work fast possible, otherwise we're struggling bills. 

Hell, nephews' mom got quarantine. got rapid test back 4 days, entire time, super worried she'd pay bills, missing much work. that's sadly super common around here... world make sense?! I've heard multiple arguments blacks get vaccinated justifications it. can't take day work, cars public transportation get sites, decades old medical experiments.

Fuck that. killing people, drives cities come them! medical experiments thing overblown ridiculous. Everyone getting vaccine, think get different one black? that's think lump anti-vaxxers conspiracy bullshit.

AND PEOPLE SAYING MAKES SENSE?! FUCK?! KILLING PEOPLE GETTING VACCINE! STOP NORMALIZING THOUGHTS START CALLING OUT.

HOLY SHIT! get that. would normally never even consider something fully tested/recommended I‚Äôm considering it. time Sorry hear that. Virtual learning definitely solution education problems, sadly rushed approach, unfinished platforms poorly trained teachers help making painless could been.

It‚Äôs ironic compliant least impact point. It‚Äôs almost pointless Nice username could start one mask couple jabs. would make world difference. depends variants emerge. Imagine new one could fully infect vaccinated previously infected people. would global shutdown time again. 3 kids 6 chance get vaccinated. look vaccinated people possible spreaders COVID-19 now. would appreciate vaccinated people would aware well. We're exhausted much looking forward kids getting vaccinated. Many people pointing cover wealth inequality, seems like would also large effect death rate. pointed also data includes period vaccines unavailable, could also lower effect vaccines final graphs. Colleges opening LA‚Äîsuch USC. I‚Äôm scared lol (as student) currently digging goal posts move them.  exactly. I‚Äôve said multiple threads Reddit loves believe it‚Äôs conservatives. None black family getting history malpractice community. family alone thinking all. Everyone‚Äôs pointing towards Tuskegee airmen Etc it‚Äôs legitimate fear. got vaccinated today brother got covid. distrust real it‚Äôs passed intentionally good reason. Bless nurses‚Ä¶why won‚Äôt hospitals step pay higher wage? It‚Äôs taking vaccine first shot away rest world. dumb antivaxxer US, you‚Äôre likely see new , dangerous variant coming another nation couldn‚Äôt get hands much vaccine forced leave population unprotected. also one okayed ""Meth. We're it."" campaign.

I'm also going bet $0.01 already vaccinated. quote scientist article. worries. think polarization people become sensitive anything seems faintly anti-vaxx attempting spread fear/disinformation. great thing need unbiased information, understandable.

It‚Äôs incredibly unlikely high risk parents definitely relate concern. locked entire cities, controlled movement, people complied containment orders. measures would yield much better results seen US CDC moving things ""masks ineffective"" half population can't even handle wearing mask social distancing.

Funny criticism pointed China's shortcomings related pandemic. Every country room improvement, none perfect. Fuck headline.

It's new variant, Delta.

Holy shit media fucking WORST last years. Oof can‚Äôt read it, question. teens vaccinated (above 12)? Seems like would indicate wealth inequality usual. surprised? Fully vaxxed currently sick. day 4 5 can't tell. Started sniffles scratchy throat. next day slight chills. taste smell. Feel pretty crappy worst cold ever had. Thank clarifying. you‚Äôre right. Russia truly decimated. 

I curious happened reading numbers Wikipedia trying figure percentage German population killed non-combatants. brain fuddled numbers. daughter scheduled return school masks tomorrow. distance option. I‚Äôm horrified Whoa, caring well others might lead learning compassion empathy! can't children learning lib values! /s would remove China numbers precaution lack transparency. That's still 2.6 billion doses, 2/3rd mRNA based. even then, actual death attributable vaccine side effects what? 15-20? Mostly AZ vaccine known parameters avoid?

Most scrutinized vaccine history, Bill Gates 5G notwithstanding. mother law still shoulder pain first dose back April. got second dose arm issues one. getting physio think. Within interview today, Dr. Fauci also advocated vaccine mandates health care workers local-level government business. trying multi-pronged approach. funny thing one convince anything. ü§£

What find insulting someone tell community knows &amp; feels. self-righteousness words troubling. level disrespect causes problems.

Make sure community vaccinated, wearing masks, &amp; socially distancing! take care ours. Normalizing voice chats video calls honestly much better encouraging people mindlessly type away without able gauge party‚Äôs tone voice facial expressions.

Privacy concerns aside, platforms like Discord absolutely great different communities people naturally jump conversation like they‚Äôd real life.  Sadly wait September chose poorly named technique deep mutational scanning. uses array yeast cells genetically modified express part spike protein called receptor-binding domain (rbd). yeast cells churn rbds, many emerge, thanks errors inherent production, slight deviations structures original wild-type virus. Dr Bloom‚Äôs team test rbds yeast cell see tightly bind ace2, receptor protein found surfaces human cells, coronavirus attaches entering cells. rbds bind tightly underlying genomes sequenced, determine mutations present. 
When Dr Bloom‚Äôs team ran scan summer 2020, spike version virus circulating, spotted mutation called n501y appeared confer binding advantage. months later, mutation appeared Alpha variant, several months dominant across much world. Dr Bloom says would ‚Äúcharitable‚Äù say colleagues predicted emergence n501y. means mutation interest turn up. even so, limited set mutations focus useful narrowing field research.

This small section article found inspiring. know doom hot ticket right feel we're overlooking amazing technologies muster fights infection. mean, came close predicting alpha variant. article goes explain, help AI, may even closer predicting entire trajectory SARS-Cov-2...it's really quite spectacular. friend covid January. decided need vaccine. Guess got covid again. Pretty sure still get vaccinated though. Thanks unvaccinated, problem Sorry didn‚Äôt think that. Maybe this? less lethal version could easily come result mutating become even easily spread. Viruses take longer kill absolutely become abs deadly rule. It‚Äôs completely random‚Ä¶

And no‚Ä¶I‚Äôm hanging hat anything. I‚Äôm hoping point doesn‚Äôt arrive simply let burn through, literally outcome goes long term. extended lockdowns. least silver lining ""waiting evidence"" stance allows face-saving excuse get vaccine, even that's quite saying 6 months ago.  hard people admit got wrong, even themselves. anybody know studies control group? saw another study percent children symptoms month covid actually percent covid. someone help explain next deadly variant evade ‚Äúscience‚Äù third world hot box like Brazil India? 

This thing popcorn fart US point. look outside window life normal. get vacation in. Fight psyops people!  Secondhand smoke spread, smoking indoors banned many places reason. Oh, crying loud. Yeah, US vaccination rate extremely high felt pretty optimistic. Yet are.  Added edit GGP comment another person noted clearer data set vaccination specifically. seems like overall black hispanic Americans higher vacc rate Republicans. much tells probably need get stop sub lol. Anyway question - don‚Äôt think so. fact already starting see this. Eventually become endemic vaccinations move on. 

The world survived many plagues past make one. Look Spanish Flu states 600k plus deaths population 1/3 today. came side sure Covid. 

I‚Äôll leave thought it‚Äôs humble opinion - eventually human nature going win science. Cycles isolation lock last long people stop respecting them. think causing lot current frustrations - social creatures technology makes easier substitute person interaction. first two shots identical. applied approval third shot, right would identical too. Presumably would use current stocks smaller syringe.  Well, one way paint broad strokes vaccine hesitant people evil, partisan nut jobs. tbf, OP changed headline. article accurately calls delta variant headline. good three weeks things seemed getting better. yup schools already session week. Luckily whole family‚Äôs vaccinated still even fully went whole year yet vaccines delta kinda scurry first second shots mRNA shots different mgs, like 50mg 100mg, ingredients something else? Fox News one channel among half dozen one mainstream media website among hundreds. million people watch country 350m. problem them, it‚Äôs anti-Fox Media talks non-stop, generating sympathetic following contrarian, ending someone doesn‚Äôt watch Fox News. Yes, logic completely flawed imo know people calling out. They've said vaccinated still get infected transmit virus, still vectors possible variants? point entire world still needs vaxxed take god knows long. None makes sense I'll happily corrected.  ones? Navajo tribe extremely high vaccination rate. Jesuschrist J&amp;J actual spike protein. viral vector vaccine, inject virus inserts mRNA strand cells make spike protein. Pfizer Moderna use carrier agent thing instead vector virus.

Try again. sure politicians really care, honestly. mean, EMT, asking scenario...is morally wrong healthcare provider tell type thinking everything fight for. would refuse follow law order like this. patients simply fellow humans pain, experience tribunals. I'm God, one is. act judge gets medical care job human capable of. I'm agnostic, reality nothing judge. 

I feel pain deathly ill unvaxxed person. much deathly ill person. know would too, shoes. Statistically speaking: Kids certain age higher chance dying influenza covid-19. Kids higher chance dying drowning covid-19. Kids much higher chance dying car crash covid-19.

Remote learning train wreck. don‚Äôt really care masks children, proof finicky child mask effectiveness nil. 

We focusing vulnerable. Agree! No, need genetically sequence sample know variant is. said delta pretty dominant right makes healthy majority cases. you‚Äôve positive test recently odds good it‚Äôs delta. It‚Äôs make decision, ultimately. Cloth masks fairly ineffective protecting wearer. take responsibility researching asking questions. never expect politicians, media, going tell whole truth. simple terms, vaccine never guarantee. people refused get vaccine, also refused mask pushed. think give many excuses people can't/won't take responsibility dumb behavior.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Sucks Covid bad enough necessary. Seems like bad news me. fair, last numbers saw Covax coalition doses donated USA. richest countries world. donating them. hoping idiots take vaccine, even expire. sending vaccines going expire X amount days, border. Start vaccinating immigrants. Well, UK actually government backed strategy COVID mitigation US pretty much strategy speak of. perfect means, UK seems learned value treating COVID like long-term issue instead short-term one. Taxing hell actually constitutional, though.

I want tangible solution get back life pre-COVID. Seriously, maddening. guy‚Äôs author one famous textbooks internal medicine thousands scientific papers name. He‚Äôs political hack, isn‚Äôt even first freaking pandemic. Never make decision think thought process would something like‚Ä¶ went got infected/sick spread family, would worth it? feel like things it‚Äôs not. attended funeral Zoom wasn‚Äôt safe travel there. Seriously, I'm new yorker, literally get vaccinated almost every street corner. free. Whole thing takes 5 minutes.

Yet vaccination rate 31% (iirc) blacks NYC. cost, accessibility time. virus isn‚Äôt really trying survive insofar it‚Äôs sentient can‚Äôt try anything. mutates random either survives (in case see spread) doesn‚Äôt. viral particle unvaccinated person way knowing responding fact vaccinated people even exist. There‚Äôs motivation virus make unvaccinated people sicker. could happen, could also make unvaccinated people less sick show measurable change severity.  Nope, we‚Äôve breakthroughs, they‚Äôve minor. Yup, trip Atlanta Tampa first week October. Fearing cancel due covid. think actually 

""Okay, die, hundred!"" Nope doesn't. know NYC black vaccination rate 31% last checked. book appointment everywhere, one hundreds pharmacies, walk major subway stations, basketball courts, parks, hell even burger joints (not burger joint). fucking everywhere, takes 5 minutes.

Want work? got it. Want work? got it. Want way grab sandwich lunch? got it. access. know delta variant not? testing variant get average covid test?  three year old student got Covid. whole class two weeks close contacts. came back fine except her. forgot numbers...thought every single number two. use spoon properly anymore. figure puzzles. could covid took months daily one one interaction start making progress. virus joke.  Right. Seems like wealth inequality rears ugly head usual. I'm fully vaxed going disneyworld next week, would still relatively safe bring normal disposable masks (not cloth) instead KN95? I've always trouble breathing someone wears glasses, wear regular masks upside metal part prevent wearing glasses (and glasses act seal since push mask), I'll wear absolutely necessary since I'm vaccinated I'm wondering normal masks would enough. Thank you. Kids never ‚Äúnot risk‚Äù, may lower average risk, ‚Äúno risk‚Äù. parent wants kid win COVID lottery? ways in-person school much safely basically sat hands 18 months instead implementing true safety measures (like ventilation!). One fav books. That's proper apocalypse lol sound like terrible situations. cities least served city run sites?  schools panhandle not. optional many opted masking. around 20% school population distanced learning first semester. anything try distance kids make class sizes smaller. Florida disaster areas worse counties actually trying. god... even think that. Completely forgot summer break. 

Delta gonna hit fan, yo.  Louder! see could link choice vaccinate taxation, especially country without public health care. set reserves surrounded razor wire corral there. Make sure reserves large enough Freedom^^TM live land. Keep away society. Good sticking guns one. Hard take ""if loved us enough wouldnt hard choice"" kind thing :(  trying describe something worse delta, breakthroughs would norm rather rare occurrences. Everybody needs step fuck up, starting dumb shit governor Texas. Nurse need break. people legitimate medical reason keeping able get vaxxed. rare, exists. I‚Äôm thinking thing. recent data places like masks never divisive, seems indicate Delta going cause massive outbreaks without vaccines, even use masking social distancing.

We‚Äôre put test sending elementary children, 100% unvaccinated, back in-person school. 

Hopefully I‚Äôm wrong, I‚Äôm predicting massive spread, whether particular school using masking, followed denial (‚Äúeveryone needs start wearing mask, *properly* time‚Äù), eventually panicked new guidance recommending return remote ‚Äúlearning.‚Äù 

I put low odds FDA actually treating approving vaccine kids urgent issue, despite American Academy Pediatrics [telling get act like there‚Äôs actually emergency.  Collins, part, expressed exasperation debates vaccine mask-wearing become politicised.  really need polarized virus that's killing people. ought everything save lives. means get vaccine. means wear mask indoors crowded space.""  added: ""This political statement invasion liberties. life-saving medical device.""

The fact even needs said ridiculous. got vaccinated wear mask got tricked ""freedoms"" taken away, I'd rather people die (myself included). feel like much nation lost mind.

Bonus points work hospital (although direct patient contact), amazing many hospital workers let conspiracy theories spread among them. I've heard say requiring masks vaccines government's way seeing easily manipulated are. that's true one heck hoax cooked up. Texas opposite liberal bastion lmao Haven‚Äôt seen variants combine others form new variants already? Like double mutant &amp; triple mutant variant? Ooofff, good luck kinda way--triage

God knows workers pushing anti-vaxxers end line lol speaking deaf ears, people message would reach cared enough already vaccinated. rest care *or* others think entire thing hoax still. Except didn't. said less obvious they're going case rates contain pandemic



And pointed out, vaccinated people stay infections unvaccinated people.


As longer someone infectious opportunities infect people.  open acceptance conspiracy theories. Yep amazing.  understand anti vaccination people ""supposedly"" living super clean life, ensuring ingest best nature offer etc.  small number, anti vaxxers seem type people think know scientists barely high school education themselves. Thank you. probably need second rapid test since PCR testing backlogged. I'm Florida unfortunately.  Indeed, 2 sides coin: 

\- minorities can't get vaccine external reasons (work, social environment, deployment)

\- antivaxxers want get vaccine due ""conspiracy"" sure, nice find shit sandwich less shit expected ü§† Yeah survival rate 6 months machine. could died month 7 know. Bad bot Louisiana 3k kids 4 days.  Bad bot Nah bash conservatives, virus political tool anyway. victims they're complicit. go way wish people ill. asshole particular, hope fucking suffered died.  Good know. double checked cdc site, says may asked Id won‚Äôt turned away don‚Äôt it.  Well, cases right... got Austin's ACL got canceled last year(brings 30mil local business/gov). go every year paid $500 3 day tickets like usual... welp today going low $330. Kinda blows since sell thousands usually can't go reason..  chest pain Body aches two days ago went away fortunately come back. always access affordability (to take time off)

That's big one. getting vaccine means taking time without pay, ""free."" ‚ÄúStop resisting‚Äù would anyone lie I'm assuming they're referring people LA, similar way adding ""nos"" end Mexicanos Norte√±os Sure√±os. basically agree. real risk.

Asking people mask public *for short longer, cases drop* reasonable.

I still going things like indoor dining, though, don‚Äôt think capacity limits brought back. would things immunocompetent, lived child, someone elderly, someone immunosuppressed. general spewing vitriol hate anti vaxers , peace love particular one. Hmm wonder. Covid #1 cause death police officers.  Covid hospitalizations going up... Usual California fires news, like last year Yep, I‚Äôm teacher. Teaching children day long mask miserable. I‚Äôll it, doesn‚Äôt mean doesn‚Äôt suck. I've seen lots ""we know long term effects."" I'm think goalposts move something along lines approval rushed. I'm little pessimistic much increase we'll really see. think we'll see major shift numbers unless see death rate greatly increase. one vaccine chance blood clotting (Johnson &amp; Johnson) heard anything stopping heart them, got source that?

I'm hypercoagulant got Moderna without issue. fact tetanus shot January worse side effects. Ah ok cool I'll cause know youre means must fine. Thanks response everything's going fine now.

When corona fucking breathe thought big deal went training usual. fucking stupid regretted lot ain't going even risk miniscule. Gotcha. Sorry. live crazy state too. tough. Well example, percentage breakthrough cases changes time would reflect change vaccine's ability fight infection. helps vocabulary around important category infections. And, new vocabulary. ""Breakthrough infection"" long used describe infections occur despite antiobiotic antiviral treatments vaccines.

Anyway, changed argument ""that's horrible term"" ""we even term"". immune system.‚Äù

Covid proved immune system could take. Im going wear mask rest life!? Theres way ever going get anywhere close 100% vaccinated. Oh right, thanks. strains come threatening ones may arrive specific outbreaks control, right? know working futurology complicated, kind scenario build data informed now? vaccines arriving poorer countries recently. Absolute nonsense spread anti-vaccine grifters Russian disinformation trolls. really think every reputable physician scientist strongly recommends vaccine causes death? 8000 people die US every day. among 160 million people vaccinated. watched Tucker Carlson preceding 30 days. Maybe need day axe too. Hi! mom high blood pressure, got vaccine totally fine aside fatigue next day :) husband convinced vaccinated ones going create super variant, since vaccinated lowers chance spreading it/getting sick it. truth talking ass? 

As side note, I'm fully vaccinated, browbeat getting jab well, despite skepticism. Ha! Same! Don‚Äôt surprised symptoms show up. Headache sore throat common early symptoms Delta. best.  Whatever cops get COVID due getting vaccinated die aren‚Äôt ones want police force anyway. 

They‚Äôre ones who‚Äôs racism cost city millions legal fees. Probably this. Hard disagree hard disagree?

Many experts saying almost exactly opposite saying. Monica Gandhi, Ashish Jha, Scott Gottlieb. aren‚Äôt nearly worried are. Anyone understands vaccines work understands variants may make less effective, unbelievably unlikely variant pop renders useless.

Also, yes. likely another 100,000 deaths end year. Probably 5,000 vaccinated. rest actively choosing endanger themselves. don‚Äôt want us sacrifice keep safe, (for part) worried COVID all, desire make larger sacrificios making keep safe. good thing that, get sick, gain immunity. Population level immunity move this. think UK there's social pressure masked, go masked think people know are.

Thus, small towns people know there's greater compliance, whereas cities anonymous less. data Havanna alone, much higher vaccination rate country whole. also says 42% fully vaccinated (meaning two weeks final dose). clear whether that's 42% infections, 42% 70%, though. Ask Duke Trujillo went. üôÑ bleep anything related discussing medical history real time?

ngl would pretty amusing hear. Tax eligible vaccine choose get holy hell.

Make federal requirement types employment schooling vaccinated, public private, upon eligible.

Stop providing medical treatment COVID refused get vaccinated.

You can't wish compliance. can't hope change attitude. *must* coerce it. church really making impact!   work employers pull crap like that? Delta variant Covid surges Colorado, city Denver instituted mandatory vaccinations city workers prevent spread disease. Denver's police union says police refuse so‚Äî""Officers trusted make choices""‚Äîand nearly 6 10 unvaccinated. half cops dying dying Covid‚Äîinfections spread people.

The survey included 780 officers. found 446 57% received COVID-19 vaccine. survey ask vaccinated ask would get vaccinated condition employment. total 558 72% surveyed said would not. Robinson says officers already required get many vaccinations, ""Frankly, we're telling people can't make decision get vaccinated. we're saying is, want work City County Denver, get vaccinated. Public health law law personnel decide so, conscious decision take disciplinary action. vaccine us individuals, us whole, making difference make sure public safe.""

God helps help themselves. want help get this, get vaccinated wear masks. Get REKT! Got Covid 1st Pfizer shot week ago. guessing shot helped mitigate sides really sore throat headache. learn home like last year. Nobody going back wearing masks.  Hence ""and progeny."" NYT v. Sullivan fertile ground expansion First Amendment coverage kinds speech, including using first amendment defense torts cases. thousands cases since firmly enshrining free speech defense court actions. 

Sullivan Supreme Court overturning law created liability certain speech government officials based speech itself. court ruled law stating ""What State may constitutionally bring means criminal statute likewise beyond reach civil law libel."" ""The test form state power applied but, whatever form, whether power fact exercised.‚Äù

A subsequent case Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., another case arriving civil action, explicitly states ""The First Amendment requires protect falsehood order protect speech matters."" ""Under First Amendment, thing false idea."" Therefore deeply reinforcing free speech protections. 

The Supreme Court later limited tort liability First Amendment Protected activity NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware stated ""While State legitimately may impose damages consequences violent conduct, may award compensation consequences nonviolent, protected activity; losses proximately caused unlawful conduct may recovered."" 

Which really brings us crux speech liability, United States, speech assumed lawful unless falls specific, narrow exceptions. Hence Tucker Carlson example quoted above. Opinion protected, thus people like Carlson Rachel Maddow give legal defense news casts clearly opinion, successful defamation defenses. always work out, see Alex Jones. help Jones went private citizens instead public figures. idea new law fall existing exceptions (except maybe fraud related exceptions certain cases, bit stretch.) mention would completely fail Sullivan test state action. don‚Äôt get it. point game it‚Äôs clear either get vaccinated get infected.

I'm going year I'm convinced ever coming back 100%. I'm going complain. got easy. many wish sense smell. normal expected, higher vaccination rate=the higher % new cases breakthroughs, overall total number lower.

Thats Israel 85% cases breakthorughs, barely 1 death per day, cause vaccines job reducing deaths infections somewhat  suppose willing bet peoples lives huh. loved ones lives? ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs big deal? It‚Äôs like flu.‚Äù

/s problem social media‚Äî many people can‚Äôt tell difference Daniel Griffin M.D., PhD. infectious disease specialist Columbia, gives weekly clinical updates Vincent Racaniello‚Äôs Week Virology podcast (he coauthor leading virology textbook) , YouTuber stayed Holiday Inn Express once. Well, rest life. maybe 90% vaccinated cases gone. enough done stop pandemic we‚Äôre going back square one people dumb don‚Äôt believe vaccines simple mask mouth go out. Don‚Äôt see U-Turn **Governor FL(U)**. He‚Äôs actually doubling made excuses saying it‚Äôs Biden‚Äôs fault, illegal immigrants fault etc. Heck, doesn‚Äôt even care kids going back school denied school districts request requiring masks indoor (in schools). I've definitely noticed thing. frustrating. paper mentions geographically isolated outbreaks lead unique strains given mutations, unique strains could pose threat. strains though won‚Äôt necessarily transmissibility Delta though would lose race Delta infect spread enough cause significant vaccine breakthrough. problem would direct Delta mutation something vaccine resistant. possible emergence vaccine breaking variant would spell immediate disaster unless transmissive Delta, something would also randomly mutate become. nothing would record, I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd appropriately spaced, I‚Äôm confused, I‚Äôll ask doctor told wasn‚Äôt bad idea complete one get other. No, last year time leadership there. Sadly Florida, still leadership. CDC recommend vaccinated people wear masks, also stopped collecting data vaccinated breakthrough cases unless resulted hospitalization death, far know still policy. clear CDC actually care making scientific recommendations regarding pandemic. made minds vaccines meant end pandemic, ""situation"" that's changed them, thing stopped maintaining previous line presence new data can't ignore.   It‚Äôs odd. took kid get vax 12-18 opened up, asked several times free coerced it.

Are supporting vaccination not? ""okay buy they're guaranteed get heaven"" Texas done truly need help. community facing enormous challenge, nurses always risen challenge,"" said Canales.

But politicians made job 100% harder failing enact concept lockdown. sacrifice state wont give shit next year Yes, always people moving goal posts (a lot last year half). suspect see vaccination rates go FDA approval. 

I optimistic see 70% fully vaccinated year end. One thing I'm really interested 'asymptomatic' cases last year holding Delta possible reinfection.

It'll interesting see percentage hit. vaccine mandates, possible, slowly allow vaxed quarantined people country. Eventually, they'll open fully, surprised they're one last countries it. Honest question: reasonable estimates/studies quantified efficacy masking is?

Background: CDC's now-famous slides, suggested efficacy masks 20-30% efficacy personal protection 40-60% efficacy source control ([slide However, provide sources estimate, differentiate different types masks.

Anyone good sources? Apparently every persons pocket knowledge details? almost died month getting vaccinated. Im sure mind works, would law procedure/detainment/gun training make expert viruses. mentioned mutation possibility fairly comments recombination possibility something news touted recently. 

 SAGE report highlights possibility recombination two aggressive variants, resulting new, substantially lethal virulent virus. Specifically, report highlights possibility alpha beta variant recombination. variants recombine, variant could comprised best worlds, forming variant dangerous transmission immune evasion.

I guess, though, I'm opposite experience are, I'm tired people describing inconvenience though unbearable burden. Everyone know restaurant industry constantly fucking whines masks meanwhile friends hospitals burning emotionally 2 years end sight. complaining strikes kinda pathetic self-indulgent. Oh thank goodness, thought going conspiracy angle lol sorry.it could definitely last longer, even upwards decade (shudders) mutates, I'm willing bet last long I'm also willing bet end well end lifetime. never seen winter jackets, nearly fur-lined hoods? high school number 10 state last school year number cases. can‚Äôt imagine school year hold ‚Ä¶aaaaaand think heart broke.

And *why* would end? Old white guy truck seemed best way sum think plan getting kids back in-person classes based notion community transmission would very, low levels time school started. way even kids less 12 years old ineligible vaccinated would fairly safe.

But adults refused quash community transmission, whether getting vaccinated wearing mask, thrown away chance reduce community transmission negligible levels school starts.

Me fiance wear masks, social distance, recieved vaccinations, people seem bound determined let natural selection take course insist upon risking death rather thB mildly inconvenience themselves.

One things certain, even whole pandemic over, I'll **NEVER** able look many people I've known life way. behavior throughout ordeal damaged many relationships beyond repair, point actively want nothing many them. sad virus revealed absolutely cruel, uncaring, egotistical, narcissistic, sociopathic many people society are, dare say; becoming result capitalistic culture seems reward behaviors. appreciate agencies realizing urgency situation might warrant letting red tape slide. also looking sub-reddit post order (hopefully) civilized discussion.

Thank this, article looks interesting. 100% typical. Yea point write things let somebody like John Cena somebody deliver message. people need change behavior going care Fauci says doesn‚Äôt DeSantis ECMO, knew surge going happen?

Because belongs party believe healthcare, science, helping people. need recombination event generate variants infectious pathogenic. end day, long widespread transmission giving virus opportunities evolve something nastier. Frequent at-home lateral flow antigen testing would gone long way help lessen devastation. tests could definitely cheaper currently - cheap enough daily testing even. Personally, subscribe Michael Mina school thought testing frequently may important using tests higher sensitivity less frequently. true masks. N95s P100s filter coming in, regularly worn there's fear respiratory infections, especially intubation procedures. assuming even live communities police. 300k models, eh? many hosts think delta available test theory? imagine child going right now. incredibly awful. 

As much blame DeSantis, also blame antivaxx parents choose get kiddos vaccinated (if they're old enough) future, refuse vaccine themselves. 

If kid parent like that, responsible getting put ICU vent - think could ever forgive them, honestly. physical burden Covid (and possible long-term aftereffects), emotional one, too, really discussed. form trauma adults, kids. Especially kids. 

I feel kids parents everything could suffering this, completely nonsensical need happen. hospital, allowed stay overnight, parent basically isolate room.

For non-covid patients, allowed designate 1 visitor, could come/go hospital day stay overnight. early pandemic testing readily available, none visitors tested upon entry/re-entry. ""asked"" wear mask, allowed sleep rooms. know many saw wearing mask sleeping? ZERO! Meanwhile, nurses given nothing simple surgical mask protect themselves, reuse. many questionable policy decisions... 

I daughter congenital condition increases risk complications respiratory illness. continuous oxygen first year life receive Synagis (RSV monoclonal antibodies) high-risk became infected. want bring anything home vaccines time, so, quit.

It's frustrating. months ago felt cusp achieving herd immunity Alpha. wife went crazy 15 days second jab, booking favorite restaurants, stopping every roadside attraction along way. came Delta, which, unknown us, already made many powerful allies local state government. Additionally (afaik) vaccines available either. checked wondering could bring doctor. getting AZ booster week getting J&amp;J May. hopefully get Sinopharm shot Fall. People country getting vaccinated possibility many doses going thrown away can't kept longer 4-6 months. example, last Monday aim 4000 shots 2100 people showed up. would rather take booster see go waste.  posted almost exact comment early 2020 downvoted hell. think mods even deleted comment.

Yes, 1918 1/3 population, worse medicine, worse equipment, worse testing, hope vaccine.  charge obvious 2020 January virus dangerous could contained soon enters bigger cities.

We‚Äôve never trusted anyone get vaccine truly care about. mandate it.   Good bot.  Removed! Yep, local hospitals. Minors 18 allowed 1 parent/guardian.

So hope young child old happy spending nights terrified minds strange scary place, gasping air, alone.

This didn‚Äôt happen. I've read, go different pharmacy chain say insurance. ask id, give passport say left home. fails cross state lines. Unpopular opinion, believe Delta proving even current vaccines still spread amongst even vaccinated people. sterilizing immunity vaccine created, properly masking best bet. allowing ""fully vaccinated"" people mix mingle unmasked, we're selecting fitter variants. Getting vaccinated LAW. 15% pretty high Texas Walmart.

We‚Äôre making progress! /s  Go wait storm Q, anytime now.    China actively tracks asymptomatic cases part ""zero tolerance"" strategy. else tell someone COVID without symptoms without mass batch testing?

but flaired ""good news"" thats info need many would've died taken protective measures (mask, social distancing, lockdown, etc) ? bad could really gotten? 

I'm morbidly curious. Also get idea many lives potentially saved measures even well-implemented everywhere  means it‚Äôs hitting harder.

Btw, one gets infected someone else vaccinated. 15% world vaccinated. lot variants over. Less internet would‚Äôve meant less global anti vaxxing least.

mRNA still ways off, would‚Äôve eventually made ‚Äútraditional‚Äù flu-style vaccine. worlds current vaccines similar way. 

If we‚Äôre serious, it‚Äôs interesting thought. Technology far enough along don‚Äôt think would‚Äôve much different, effort fight back would‚Äôve dragged maybe longer (vaccine, testing, etc). 

Though given insurance situation back lack ACA expansion might‚Äôve made even bigger economic bloodbath. I‚Äôm old fart six months 2nd shot. takes time vaccinate. wish they'd tell members, ""We're negotiating vaccine mandate, it'll probably happen, probably start getting vaccinated avoid interruptions disruptions life classes school year"".

2. Upon US stay family, ended getting J&amp;J vaccine local, family owned pharmacy. roughly 1-2 months ago. Flew back Netherlands get back work.  
3. Netherlands requiring signed documentation regarding vaccinations order get officially registered. Unfortunately documentation small pharmacy J&amp;J vaccination sufficient Netherlands requirements. 
4. considering getting 3rd vaccine (Pfizer, doses) officially registered Netherlands.

 
From research, ""some"" research data show getting 3rd vaccination type issue me, sample size small relative population whole far conclusive. expected reasonable things considered.

Right now, we're seeing reports amount children hospitalized increasing, yet data show due increase rate serious illness, opposed increase cases. Yes, are.  I‚Äôm glad church trying make difference, say lot churches.

Before first wave, Austin TSA average 50-55% ICU beds occupied. would normal times sufficient reserve care major surges.

From beginning pandemic, number ICU beds rose 400 current 500, 25% increase, number total beds Austin TSA rose 2300 4300.

The issue is, add ICU beds without required staff. enough specialized nurses handle it. many quit jobs take stress anymore. Imagine 18 months treating people, trying save lives surge people stupid take free available vaccine. Thanks, vegans. I'm Missouri; seem tiny here!  Sometimes seems like least 50 percent! Worth noting profit motive sell doses, I‚Äôd take findings grain salt.

We know vaccines still provide extremely high level protection severe illness still, isn‚Äôt need rush ahead doctors‚Äô FDA. approve recommend booster, go nuts, don‚Äôt run lie get third shot own.   judge, would know comment prejuiced cases.  little actual information deadly Delta variant is? went looking answer basic question, nothing found actually answered question. went symptoms, transmission, unvaccinated likely get it, even speculation whether variant actually dangerous. intentionally vaccines contain modified version different virus one causes COVID-19.

However, still pretty fucking callous convinced spending 9 days hospital 3 ICU seeing son's wife die. Oh, referring lebron - thought referring neoncow (at time posted, neoncow's comment one 300 upvotes). Ya, context right. *conservatives  Seriously - almost got taken flu otherwise healthy teenager (went mycobacterium pneumonia put ICU 4 5 days, hospital lot longer that).

Dying laughing.   people work 24/7?  Completely agree you. Advil wasn‚Äôt even invented yet! differences medicine technology enormous, don‚Äôt doubt would‚Äôve monumentally worse. Yes can. Example: arranged participated 2020 Sturgis Motorcycle Rally blamed 250000 Covid infections country, everyone sane told hold Rally begin with. People realize confusing try parent days. example, follow ABCs safe sleep (to reduce risk sids), baby actually get sleep they're uncomfortable time. baby get enough sleep behind mental development exhausted parents. exhausted parents choice make: risk sids 0.09% chance per year stave 100% chance mental developmental issues opposite. miserably sleep deprived parents, following parents advise, stick blanket baby get rest and, gods forbid, turns badly, really going point bad parents making call? Modern parenting absolutely riddled no-win, conflicting, even downright dangerous advise modern parents can't rely parents navigate lot reasons. 

Imagine like parents secumb lies covid try see picture point view. supposed socially stunt child two years absolutely critical development 300/73000000 children US died covid? Add they're hearing every angle social network; hoax, like flu, bs mental gymnastics require cope making horrible choice hurt child way... 

Yah government lot more, cdc more, politicians elect better people. blame parents put situation. Simple way think this.

1/ Home school children highly likely remain alive well. Encourage online social interactions.

2/ Allow children go school potentially get COVID, &amp; potentially die potentially get long COVID. Also potentially pass COVID others - including older persons. 


I feel choice relatively simple. 


I neighbours, married couple, double vaccinated. Unfortunately, 7 year old grandchild gave COVID. child‚Äôs mother also caught COVID. one vaccination. okay symptoms mild. 

These people know caught COVID vaccinated. Two people know told caught vaccinated. cases mild.

I have/ work colleagues caught COVID children, pre vaccine days, didn‚Äôt well. become virus-free. Remember, it‚Äôs fetuses. already born don‚Äôt matter. got downvoted hell couple weeks ago said children going get sick droves. 

Someone said come back apologize wrong, set reminder six months. Again, two weeks. black Republicans? surprised really high really low. It‚Äôs much contagious, 2-3x compared initial strain US.

Which still contagious btw. YOUUU ESSSS AAAAY Clearly nowhere near infectious. article sounds overblown No. children‚Äôs hospital nearby I‚Äôm assuming might go there. come us need get admitted would transferred children‚Äôs hospital too. 

I seeing tons pregnant moms come deliver also covid positive. That‚Äôs definitely time high too. unsure babies affected I‚Äôve seeing last couple weeks different last year. good way. Yup, everything COVID shitty, massive leap forward mRNA technology hell silver lining. 

Don‚Äôt think even optimistic among us thought we‚Äôd see kinds advances another ten years, minimum. 

Crossing fingers baller flu vaccine soon, never mind potential something approaching malaria vaccine (knock wood cross fingers, barely even dare dream big). alright, everyone. ü•áüí™ Setting records like ain‚Äôt nothing especially interested knowing breakthrough rate. 

The acutal breakthrough rates worthless risk evaluation.

In ideal world vaccine 90% uptake 80% efficancy, would mathematically expect see 64% cases breakthrough.

But vaccine 55% uptake mathematically gets 20% breakthrough rate.

And Covid vaccine 100% efficancy rate, clear start breakthrough cases would happening probably spread it, too. really communicated US...

What really looking cases relation vaxxed / unvaxxed.  Washington State, case 19-year old (former high school football player) got COVID-19 early, March 2020. survived infection fine, even hospitalized. Six months later, dropped dead massive heart attack.

This shouldn‚Äôt taken lightly seems chances still small anyone age bracket still seriously risk. kids exposed leas 400 children died since virus started last year. 

If you‚Äôre worried think child risk, def mask keep away crowds. otherwise think people know it‚Äôs still unlikely anything would happen child. 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get obliterated posting feel that‚Äôs objective takeaway here. started ""tree hugger"" fallacy back 70's, mocking environmentally conscious. turned denying evolution. branched there. here. vaccines neutralizing virus problem though. reduces symptoms &amp; reduces hospitalizations current strains, I've heard even allows one get sickness faster unvaccinated (no idea claim true), neutralizing virus chance mutate. Doubt anyone going icu vaccinated. read whole thing realized data it, heh. Anyways, see anything suggests saying. read titer falls rapidly natural infection estimated half life 90 days, also mentioned recall immunity help prevent severe infection. said also pointed vaccines booster shot confer prolonged higher titer ranging half 4 times average titer person natural infection. High titer particular antibody meant essentially stop communal spread supposed drop repeatedly exposed. That's works. One major issue rough go due many factors, immune system probably see fit crank titer damn high. also issue immune system solves problem. chops virus attempts assemble antibody candidates bond pieces. Now, already know spike protein hold shape separated viral envelope makes developing antibody part virus harder inconsistent. delta variant much previous versions allows gain foothold system quicker, flooded antibody it, sort fucked, body recall make antibody, put brakes infection quicker would kicking types antibodies it. advantage vaccine. modified spike protein hold shape stand alone ensuring immune system builds specific antibody one effective rat fucking ability virus get beachhead least hold long.  lawsuits left right, ultimately jobs travel start requiring it, theyre SOL. *Infantile?!?* Considering degree emotional development among GOPers, checks out.  deny treatment someone overdosed taking drugs. deny someone antibiotics wear condom. 

This all. either cases one else suffering. Like someone ODed rubbing OD someone else. someone wear condom well that's 2 people involved society. F people freedoms cause taking away everyone else's freedom. social media (certainly equivalent today) either misinformation. 

That made huge difference, people Facebook YouTube making videos claiming know better actual experts.

I pay attention massive spike COIVD point multiple states breaking pre-vaccine records. I'm going go yes. Every teacher, without medical reason, required get COVID vaccine every kid US 12+ too. Good. sparing resources unvaccinated people. wait one two string variants get baby killer variant. anti-vaxx morons going make happen soon enough quest precious herd immunity.  like changing Titanic's captain hit iceberg blame ship sinks.

Pizza everyone! last 2 years, I'm taking anything granted anymore... I'll hope everything ok 100%.

I miss days. 3 4 months ago looking 90% efficacy infection Alpha. necessarily means expecting 10% rate breakthrough cases.

Maybe read discussion pay attention usernames embarrass more. think time. criminal lack protection intervention. Biden better Trump matter. people PRETENDING vegan.

It's study cited NY Times article, failed expand it. Companies 'letting' people work form home, accepting reality. Workers longer accept go work waste 2-6 hours driving absolutely reason. smart thing, people stand make $$ holding stupid. Instead incentivizing them, need penalized ACT RIGHT.

We individual mandate ACA now. Goddamn. School started yet. Could maybe talk administrators schools mayor? That‚Äôs fucking sad. put blame on? I'm Texas I've yet vaccinated. finally convinced I'm scheduled 1st shot Friday. kids start school Thursday one required wear masks school taken plexiglass protection, etc. course there's Abbott executive order. South African here. Delta washed country, children know hospitalised. weird.

Vaccination levels still 10% adult population. Uh, yeah, it‚Äôs almost like we‚Äôre like anyone else, don‚Äôt support animal suffering exploitation. Even Republican leadership local level back would revolted public health guidance Clinton Gore administration. Jeb Bush DeSantis governor Florida could different other. Jeb would've complied Clinton whatever health practices necessary keep Florida safe. It‚Äôs strange argument make either way. Like bear running around town eating people said ‚Äòwell bear killed 3 people. know many people die traffic accidents?‚Äô Ok... shouldn‚Äôt still something bear? Real vegans push back hard
Because kind crap, people may tempted accommodate vegans much less it‚Äôs important hit high threshold vaccinations community.

Well worry US never going happen unless virus starts becoming lethal high percentage time. Maybe next 5 10 mutations we'll get there. high blood pressure gotten vaccine?? effect BP? that‚Ä¶actually really doesn‚Äôt. catch different variant increased viral load variant end getting sick, many times expect organs take beating fail?

Parents calling crying, literally tears thought children needing wear masks. kind absurdity schools need deal with. every parent pulling kids remote homeschooled, dozen parents calling complain want masks social distancing end. I'm happy vaccinated, wave going suck lot kids, immunocompromised people, anti-vaxxers. That‚Äôs much encouraging situation Florida right now. number alarming school even started yet, cases expected rise exponentially among children.  Sunk cost fallacy It‚Äôs public elementary school district Brentwood near Antioch SF East Bay Area. There's lot known far common long COVID vaccinated people. theory fact risk serious illness much lower also mean risk long COVID much lower too, specific numbers back yet. Rand Paul telling people ignore CDC sure ain‚Äôt gonna help stop this. Wrong Brentwood.   FYI that‚Äôs Brentwood SF East Bay Area (Contra Costa County), Brentwood near LA. Different Brentwood. That‚Äôs East Bay (near Oakland). It‚Äôs almost like protect people, society large. Honestly it‚Äôs probably lack ECMO machines problem. patients extremely high acuity often 1:1 nursing assignment, ECMO also requires perfusionist. It‚Äôs probably much staffing problem.   eaten meat 8 years, got shots soon eligible (March, Pfizer). Yeah, I'm certainly expert FDA matters, wonder well approval children.  UK here...well us.

Why Covid becoming issue kids US? UK, appear issue children, time pandemic. Remember people reddit claiming attacks obese elderly? anthrax vaccine 4 shots, MMR 2. HEP 3. lot vaccines multiple boosters.   much emphasis cases cases divorced deaths?

Because, get ready this, diseases effects besides killing you. Wild right? Like, respiratory problems rest life. Or, accelerate dementia. Better yet, there's probably lot problems cause line, surprise, brand new virus!

Oh, forgot mention spreads, mutates. new variants, infect even vaccinated people. Perhaps new variant deadly, since that's concerned with. maybe cause long-lasting health effect, know, cares, right?

So maybe care ends life, someone vaccinated, I'd prefer catch virus breathing fucked rest life simpleton can't fathom letting virus stay around forever hEy DeAd great idea. Barbarians. We're nation fucking barbarians. say irresponsible.

But people need weigh odds rather succumbing fear mongering. many parents went school, risk death flu/pneumonia statistically higher risk death Covid children.  

Would preferred homeschooled, parents worked simply education (because remote schooling possibility) risk going public school dying contracting flu pneumonia? 

Each parent needs decide, least facts first. first time he's situation like (things got bit dicey AIDS epidemic) he's used it.  -and it‚Äôs fault. keep cutting last part sentences.  important question one talking regards Delta variant.

R0 original virus around 2.5, Alpha around 3.5. Delta's R0 estimated 6 9, argue twice infectious. also seems shorter cycle time, say, 3 days instead 4 days someone becomes infectious.

The thing people seem forget ""2X"" part also exponentiated. becomes monster cycles. Let's say earlier variant R 3 Delta R 6. Every 4 days (cycle time), get 3 new earlier variant infections every 1 infected individual. Delta, every 3 days get 6 infections.

Consider time period bit 2 weeks: get 4 cycles original 5 cycles Delta. So, rough math looks like comparison 3^4 vs 6^5. That's 81 vs 7776. *Over two weeks, doubling R causes almost 100 times many cases.*

Yes, rough, back envelope math, real world, probably disastrous. see bad doubling reproduction rate be.

Back original point whether infection Delta greater risk serious illness children. probably case, children's hospitals going fill potentially dumping something like order two magnitude cases time period.

I want send school right though. So, like many parents, stuck rock hard place. I'm pissed it. I‚Äôm late reply, keep mind according CDC‚Äôs website, stopped monitoring infections result hospitalization death. you‚Äôre looking statistics regards breakthrough infections don‚Äôt lead hospitalization deaths, you‚Äôd need analyze data country United States happens keeping data. 

[As May 1, 2021, CDC transitioned monitoring reported vaccine breakthrough cases focus identifying investigating hospitalized fatal cases due cause. shift help maximize quality data collected cases greatest clinical public health importance. **Some** health departments **may** continue report vaccine breakthrough cases national database continue submit specimens CDC sequencing. However, CDC focus monitoring reported hospitalized fatal (emphasis mine) really think that‚Äôs viable option *everybody*? households one parent, needs work/earn money. households two parents need work. parent(s) working, kid(s) aren‚Äôt school, often go somewhere, like daycare, cost money. 

So, matter much technology someone might access to, homeschooling isn‚Äôt option many, many parents. Many parents stuck position choice send kids school, keep roof home put food table.

Even two batches vaccines soon administered, Taiwan still well short vaccines needed get population vaccinated.

To date, 37 percent Taiwan's 23.5 million population received first shot COVID-19 vaccine, 2.1 percent fully vaccinated two shots, according Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC).

Also Monday, CECC said 1,500 people received first dose Moderna vaccine categorized incorrectly national vaccine appointment system, allowing book times second dose earlier scheduled.

Under current CECC regulations, people fall categories 1-3 vaccination priority list -- medical workers, government epidemic prevention workers, people higher risk COVID-19 exposure due job -- pregnant women get two Moderna doses 28 days apart, normally advised.

People categories wait 10-12 weeks first dose get second shot needed fully vaccinated.

Some group reported, however, received text messages recent days informing could book appointment get second dose, even though 10 weeks yet passed since first jab.

At press briefing Monday, CECC spokesperson Chuang Jen-hsiang (Ëéä‰∫∫Á••) said around 1,500 people incorrectly categorized medical workers got first Moderna shot.

The mistakes corrected system, Chuang said, properly categorized still go scheduled appointments receive second shot.

(By Chang Ming-hsuan Chiang Yi-ching) useful information. You‚Äôve clearly done lot research. Unfortunately yes, even US, UK, Canada countries access vaccines (and even high uptake) they're minority countries enough Vaccines can't even fucking think every time start angry-crying. sick.

Research long haul covid bit. Take look subreddit long haul covid. Even asymptomatic mild cases covid resulted long haul symptoms/complications. issues include cardiovascular (increased heart rate, Afib), respiratory (not able much anything without gaspin gfo rair), neurological complications (dizziness, numbness, tingling, brain fog, etc). also appears decent percentage contract covid end least one long haul symptom sticks them. people sub long haul issues well year. fun. 100% guarantee people saying people claiming ""pro-life"". Mine weeks away able get starts back tomorrow. sucks I'm 'fortunate' enough live someplace vaccination rates relatively high (well 50% adults, good US, anyway) schools decided mask mandate schools.

I would like see politicians explicitly state, ""I fine X kids dying go without mitigation measures"". Force say threshold responsible kids' deaths. I'll bet none would say it.

Partly due vaccine hesitancy combined politically based messaging, partly due lack sufficient vaccines countries. trying beat virus knows borders, approach border oriented. Information quality issue. Get better sources. funny little society actually cared respiratory illnesses before.

Heck doctors office everyone mixed regardless illness, cough broken bones, young old, matter. Even though separation based illness concept like 2000 years old doctors Roman empire.

We know separate people based illness doctors waiting room, emergency rooms etc, mask flu season, make much easier take sick leave, enable people work home crowded places. Wonder actually standard. almost 60% counties population fully vaccinated, would put near top world vaccination rate rankings. sobering news northern states come fall/winter. need fully approve vaccine allow vaccinations 5-11 year olds least NOW. would republicans care children born? point... it‚Äôs multifactorial problem bring residents‚Äô pay doesn‚Äôt solve anything either.  This, unfortunately, makes sense. Ive gathered, Covid acts like HIV doesnt necessarily kill itself, weakens immune system enough becomes much easier catch other, deadly viruses.   Damn man I‚Äôm 30s fuck keep making mistakes like that.

Thanks heads up. also finish residency make significantly more. Guess better get 2 jobs then!

- Republicans Good you. Better late never.  concerning adults interact children regular basis. elderly parents watch niece nephew regularly kids starting school adding anxiety. parents vaccinated, elderly increases chances severe breakthrough cases.

Government that's welcoming back. majority us SCREAMING borders remain closed longer cases US SURGING. 80 percent country says borders stay closed, says something. 

I'm giving 2 1/2 weeks generous, cases start snowball again. Pro choice gets compared transmittance smallpox. making valid points here.

I‚Äôm sorry deal this. job covid exposure last week closed shop day. I'm sure someone tested positive.

I've thinking weekend talking supervisor refresher proper mask use safe coverings since couple coworkers use neck gaiters safe. resource use cited sources help? video would really help. sub posted in, first top-voted comment guy saying surgical cloth masks work. Despite, know, fucking citations link say opposite. 

You can't fix stupid. pinto variant exploding across America. That's lot money. Except look excess death rate we‚Äôre 900,000 last looked. number one. One own. Surely would make care? Maybe heard parents complain masks year say awful 'dangerous' are. They're probably convinced better alternative  bro incentive getting covid Ah, course. Darn it. I‚Äôve got 3 year old daycare I‚Äôm anxious get vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt matter. Since vaccinated chances getting long Covid break case extremely rare. 

Given low risk worried it. people spreading gotten vaccinated that‚Äôs problem. massive inflation major shift too. terms spending power, 15$/hr gets less today 10$/hr 18 months ago. Gas, food, housing, jesus NPR thing car repair parts going 30% average weekend. point purchasing power hasn‚Äôt gone up. explain organ damage well?

Well, fair enough, hope correct long term plan. beyond paranoid world vaccines reduce risk dramatically IMO. 12. Best way shield vulnerable everyone get vaccinated. Aged like milk still appalled people refusing vaccine wealthy countries like US, UK, Australia. underdeveloped poor nations people fighting get dose. get it, get grateful. Remove science politics it. sick sneeze cough cover mouth? vast majority people do. sick avoid going work, public places avoid social gatherings? people do.

So global pandemic happens, make sense order get sick get others sick would cover mouths times public avoid social gatherings? U A! U A! think person replying saying masks work can't help mitigate aerosols. also talking aerosols. 

It kind reads like y'all two separate conversations go back look it.  I'm sure see lot 'fear-mongering'. tend see opposite.

If live low vaccination uptake region like ( local hospital went ICU Divert ) can't help concerned. work industry hammered pandemic can't help concerned. FB feed full 'pray aunt so-and-so ER covid' can't help concerned.

Being concerned pandemic smart thing.  virus would drastically change DNA bypass vaccines completely heavily dependent spike protein. Chances mutation happening basically slim none.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

HCM CITY ‚Äî HCM City authorities said city would¬†cover expenses for¬†funeral services deceased COVID patients¬†in ‚Äúthe safest solemn manner‚Äù.

Nguy·ªÖn To√†n Th·∫Øng, director city Department Environment Natural Resources, said family would receive¬†VNƒê17 million (US$740) to¬†cover¬†transportation, cremation¬†and delivery ashes them.
For COVID patients die¬†at¬†hospital, city Department Health will¬†transfer funds hospitals arrange funeral services.

For COVID-19 patients die home, families need present death certificate their¬†ward commune township authorities receive¬†financial¬†support.

The city also set standard price funeral service fees do¬†not die COVID.¬†
According Th·∫Øng, people¬†should contact HCM City Urban Environment Company recommendations find reasonably priced service provider.

The price VNƒê4.2 million¬†at burial facilities managed HCM City Urban Environment Company compared VNƒê4.5-5 million companies, according Th·∫Øng.

Cremation people died COVID-19 must done¬†according a¬†six-step process prescribed Ministry Health ensure safety.

When COVID patient dies, whether home hospital, body must disinfected transported directly cremation place specialised vehicles cremation within 24 hours time¬†of death.

For a¬†death occurring medical examination treatment facility, burial process must follow special process dangerous diseases, and¬†the burial must done soon possible hospital funeral home, a¬†limited¬†number people participating funeral process.

The city assigned HCM City High Command receive return ashes deceased COVID-19 patients to¬†the family.
If¬†family members cannot directly receive ashes deceased, city‚Äôs Religious Affairs Committee will¬†transfer ashes¬†to kept temples pagodas relatives come receive them.

Cremation carried B√¨nh H∆∞ng H√≤a Cemetery B√¨nh T√¢n District, city‚Äôs major largest centre, well ƒêa Ph∆∞·ªõc Cemetery B√¨nh Ch√°nh District, Ph√∫c Vi√™n Cemetery Th·ªß ƒê·ª©c City, Th√°p Long Th·ªç Cemetery C·ªß Chi District.

According Th·∫Øng, city asked cemeteries raise price¬†of service or¬†refuse case.

HCM City, country‚Äôs pandemic epicentre, recorded 124,000 infections since late April. 2,500 deaths have¬†occurred¬†as Monday, country‚Äôs 3,215 deaths. ‚Äî VNS¬†¬† agree.

I think ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù somewhere middle. pandemic won‚Äôt declared nobody celebrate governments likely won‚Äôt mandate much beyond mask mandate going forward cases get hand. 

Vaccinated people start risk assessment strive find balance living lives avoiding Covid. 

It won‚Äôt look like 2019, won‚Äôt sunshine lollipops, doubt we‚Äôll ever status quo bad Q3 Q4 2020 ever again. vaccine first available US people frantic get it. one phone hours. also illegal West Virginia, Oklahoma, Arizona 2018 anyway won. vaccine mandates completely necessary hope there's organized pushback. side effects vaccine get progressively worse added dose get better? would evading vaccines, sense exactly so. that's happening.  They're people okay [life planes. Check quote ""Brad Walton,"" true Utahn: ‚ÄúI fly every week I‚Äôm comfortable flying. thought plane going wouldn‚Äôt get it.""

So, basically, safety measures necessary plans experience unplanned events.

Oh, also: make point ask whether flight going boarding life rafts. important, even flight plan go water, like Sully's flight, might end water anyway. Yeah, thats let foot doctor build rockets, experts expert all. /s specific kind face covering talking here.

Based picture N95s, need specific this.

Now N95's easily available really promote using there's high risk exposure.  difference child adult trials though. children less likely severe COVID, therefore, takes time kids enrolled gather appropriate number safety events. adult trials, ton severe COVId events due high incidence COVID areas trials conducted, that's able get endpoints quickly. FDA asked Pfizer Moderna enroll children events captured lot easier get data need clinical trials clinical trial participants getting sick quickly. kids get severely ill lower rate (from COVID) adults. Turned local news. Big mistake part. 

If there's one lesson I've learned crisis this. mental sake, limit news intake.

I experience morning climate change. already know we're fucked, switched radio. Yeah, she‚Äôs good sport all, draining.

She gets Pfizer vax next week. allergist making get hospital, two nurses armed epipens watching three hours. don‚Äôt know she‚Äôll react new allergies. Viruses goals. care get sick, don't, evolution ends selecting whatever spreads better.

Diseases kill hosts, especially ones quickly, less able spread asymptomatic stuff. severe symptoms compromise spread general, person sick enough leave home going spread like someone mild symptoms will. balance risks COVID damage remote ""learning"" kids' education, especially among already-disadvantaged groups. 

That's easy. decide uneducated babies better around dead babies. vocal minority, like every brand stupid. Thanks chuckle. 

That'd satisfying see. got first vaccine December second January. 8 months later I‚Äôm sure detectable antibodies still system. I‚Äôm going angry I‚Äôm allowed travel got shot early wouldn‚Äôt show antibodies test.

Coronaviruses reside cell's nuclei way shingles does.

What exactly think new line viruses would do? understanding basically sterilizing immunity Alpha (and host pre-Delta variants). That's masks got dropped vaccinated.

It's delta don't. make new vaccine Delta++ whatever variant around finally resources (still vaccinating 3rd world need finish coming back 1st world) continue vaccinate everyone greatly slow creation new variants.  Good point. Sucks health care workers.

I‚Äôm vaccinated I‚Äôve cold-like symptoms days, don‚Äôt see point getting tested, still work since ended covid pay. wish people friend relative ICU. Might make bit empathetic. US vaccination rate extremely high felt pretty optimistic. Yet are.

I held pessimistic view beginning.

I initially thought would 18-24 months would vaccine available general public.
-To pleasant surprise, achieved less year. vaccine tested individuals emergency use authorization December 2020 vaccines drugs achieve FDA approval.
-The mRNA vaccines (which decade research work use now) incredibly high efficacy rate, would thought would achieved first attempt vaccines.

Once vaccines rolled out, would thought supply chains would strained much 75% vaccination rate nation wide would take another year more.
-Again, pleasant surprise, federal government done amazing work could achieved 6 months. 

I knew skeptics certain political leaders would actively hinder vaccine role out. initially projected 30% country, could delayed herd immunity initial 1 year 2 3 years initial roll vaccines.
-I never anticipated entire political party, news conglomerate, large number republicans actively spread misinformation actively try hinder rollout vaccines.
--Yet, are. 8 months rollout vaccines 49% nation FULLY vaccinated.


Against odds (and least predictions), vaccines developed faster, safer, distributed widely thought would even vaccine available. Yet, risk simplifying situation, people's fickleness thing stopping us getting everyone eligible vaccinated get ahead virus potentially stop it.


New news makes pessimistic ever ending. growing concern animal reservoirs. even virus subdued eradicated humans, likely circulate mutate animal populations jumps back humans again.
-What learn make sweeping global reforms animal husbandry interactions animals limit chances animal human disease spread.
--People creatures habit money drive pretty much everything. likely never going happen species take value safe practices (in industries).

Hope gives hope dread world. late proactive variants [They stop aerosols please stop spreading misinformation. know intentions good though. support grown evidence benefits accrued: many scientists say help catch virus-containing droplets particles emitted infected wearers even said offer protection infection healthy wearers. said, effective depends type mask, fit, made view mask wearing much changed, reduce aerosols,‚Äù said Hiscox. ‚ÄúI happy confess beginning last year thought hand washing important mask wearing ‚Ä¶ now, yes think [well-fitting] masks play role.‚Äù know least state (NY) covid passport called excelsior pass, confirms database whether got vaccine pharmacy/location. get card virtually scanned.

What makes right bad time children compared history human race? I‚Äôm south, Fortunately division state government mandating vaccine September 1 - weekly testing mask wearing, sigh. 

My close coworkers already vaccinated lot staff aren‚Äôt they‚Äôre bitching getting now. haven‚Äôt heard anyone quitting opting test/mask option. They're free please, zero problems paying employees.

My close coworkers already vaccinated lot staff aren‚Äôt they‚Äôre bitching getting now. haven‚Äôt heard anyone quitting opting test/mask option. Delta showed even worse evasion Lambda lab, efficacy went slightly (if all). numbers Delta breakthroughs mostly huge numbers cases, mostly unvaccinated, leading smaller rise breakthroughs. 

Some data suggest booster might needed 6 months 2nd dose, would generic dose, variant specific dose. evidence far variant specific vaccines would necessary. Although obviously improve still working vaccine, that's great, far works. lot remote work low contact work hiring. one times confidently get somewhere fast. Fun fact: Publix major contributor campaigns minimum wage increase earned sick time. \-Oh yea? Well aunts sister law posted pretty convincing counter arguments Facebook said blablabla... 

\*sigh\* They'll share idiots who'll present fake certificates get through. Hope they'll catch those, put jail month, make pay ban forever. Let guess. You‚Äôre somewhere 22 40 years old? Prolly closer 30? Singapore dumb US good job Yeah assholes still getting vaccinated wearing masks, whole point reinstating mask mandates. Variants thing everything possible done stop spread gets worse. sister ICU nurse major, liberal US city. says there‚Äôs many nurses Doctors floor unvaccinated. One Doctors even hospitalized weeks ago. odd. main problem elderly refusing get vaccinated. ton, quite ER compared pre-Delta variant times. politicians pivoting getting vaccinated, even make appointment, walk centres (we problem no-shows vaccines going waste, intensely)

It likely go too, since 20-30s allowed make appointment vaccines monthish back. also conditional re-openings, gatherings 5 allowed fully vaccinated (2 shots + 14 days gap 2nd shot), 2 unvaccinated. Also, new law October onwards unvaccinated go back work need pay pocket Covid-19 tests. Hoping pushes vaccination numbers up. 

The anti-vax groups equating active discrimination though, idk laugh cry it. $ fools buy tickets beginning year, feel bad that. hopeful. Even new variants, everyone gotten vaccinated offered mess. 
Actually cancelling going November? Yeah, probably foolish. Ah yet another article tells us Delta one infectious viruses ever, somehow apparently confer natural immunity absolutely one. Sadly yes. lot people years poor lifestyle choices left precarious health. Heartbreaking see kids, teens folks 20s already morbidly obsess. keep hospital mission accomplished! Yep, worst humanity offer. news saying USA, unvaccinated ppl getting sick enough hospitalized due covid-19. I'm getting message are. adults voluntarily declining vaccination driving increased covid hospitalizations. think Osterholm said best science dictates can‚Äôt do, previous norms. don‚Äôt think anyone advocating complete return 1980s reality worldwide emergency made unsafe around large groups people order protect ones family sacrifices need made accordingly. Really? Wow, thanks. Last checked, never stopped Americans. States can't leave Union will, Constitution allow that. favorite politicians also medical insurance treat side effects. not. exactly making cases go like crazy Florida? vaccination rate great still better 27 states. look state like Alabama, worst vaccination rate country, cases spiked already falling back down.

Honest question, cant hospital confirm whether kids covid?   Abstract:

BACKGROUND
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection elicits humoral immune response characterized neutralizing antibodies spike protein. prior studies demonstrated detectable antibodies SARS-CoV-2 months post infection, consistent data regarding long-term persistence protective antibody titers.

OBJECTIVE
We investigated longevity antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 cohort patients received care COVID-19 outpatient, emergency department (ED), hospital settings.

METHODS
The study cohort consisted post-COVID-19 patients enrolled prospective research registry Mount Sinai Health System New York City July 20, 2020, April 13, 2021. Eligible participants ‚â• 18 years old, spoke English Spanish, laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection received COVID-19 vaccination enrollment. Potentially eligible participants contacted mail followed phone call approached person receiving acute post-COVID-19 care. None participants received COVID-19 vaccination period follow-up.

We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based stabilized full-length spike protein assess SARS-CoV-2 antibodies least 30 days 13 months acute infection. ELISA results characterized discrete titers 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, 1:960, ‚â• 1:2880. Starting December 2020, laboratory started using arbitrary units (AU/mL, 0‚Äì125) report ELISA results. titer ‚â• 1:320 (‚â• 16 AU/mL) correlated ‚â• 90% neutralizing activity microneutralization assay used criterion convalescent plasma donation [1].

We calculated unadjusted rates immunoglobulin G titer ‚â• 1:320 used generalized estimating equation model estimate probability positive test time according site acute COVID-19 care adjusting age, sex, race, ethnicity (SAS 9.4, Cary, NC). study approved Institutional Review Board.

RESULTS
Of 758 participants enrolled cohort, 35 (5%) missing date COVID-19 diagnosis, 75 (10%) received COVID-19 vaccination enrollment, 28 (4%) undergo antibody testing, leaving cohort 620 participants contributed 1195 antibody tests. mean age 49 years, 64% female, self-identified 53% white, 16% Black, 20% Latinx (Table 1). Overall, 90% (95% CI: 84‚Äì94%) 83% (95% CI: 67‚Äì92%) patients positive antibody tests 6 13 months post-COVID-19, respectively. Antibody titers relatively stable 13 months post infection (odds ratio [OR]: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.90‚Äì1.01 every 30 days post-COVID-19) (Fig. 1). adjusted probability positive antibody test 13 months 71% (95 CI: 75‚Äì91%) outpatients, 75% (95% CI: 62‚Äì85%) ER patients, 84% (95% CI: 74‚Äì91%) hospitalized patients. Positive tests likely among inpatients (OR: 2.18, 95% CI: 1.23‚Äì3.86), ER patients (OR: 1.21, 95% CI: 0.75‚Äì1.97) compared outpatients.

Discussion
We found neutralizing titers spike protein SARS-CoV-2 remained relatively high modest declines 13 months post infection. Patients severe disease showed higher rates positivity time suggesting robust antibody response.

Understanding immunological memory post-COVID-19 provide insights risk reinfection potential durability vaccines. early reports suggested antibody titers may rapidly decrease [2], studies found high antibody titers several months acute COVID-19 infection [3,4,5,6]. However, many studies included relatively small samples reported overall rates positivity titers may confer neutralizing activity. extend results showing persistent rates positive antibody response (at potentially neutralizing titers) 13 months acute infection. important note titers 1:320 correlated high neutralizing activity vitro, unclear provide protection reinfection. information severity outpatient illness; thus, able compare immune response asymptomatic vs. mild moderate symptomatic patients. Additionally, cannot exclude severity acute COVID-19 associated likelihood participating institutional registry. point fitter variant better booster lot sooner read base vaccines still pretty good lambda variant One professors said obstetricians used wear dirty aprons sho much business got child births. sure that's true know around time figured needed sterilize hands tools deaths infections mother's childbirth plummeted. I‚Äôm never near schools. 

People aren‚Äôt vaccinated protecting aren‚Äôt. wearing mask isn‚Äôt going make put one on. think know better doctors probably would Still day care. It‚Äôs place learning. say doesn‚Äôt make true. Sorry educate that.  Even gaiter much, much better nothing. air droplets spread COVID microscopic, large number still blocked loose-knit mesh [as recent studies since they're stretchy, people less likely let fall nose mouth.

Obviously, medical masks N95s much better. I'd rather see people wear gaiters nothing all. Bottom line, kids need spend time outdoors lol.  JPow step buy them.  Yes know needle yet move all. 90% 65 crowd vaccinated, well majority adults here‚Ä¶ can‚Äôt see much spike all. world 60%? really many antivax nurses? Read please. Average age vaccinated person. Bullshit.  guy wearing camouflage truck YouTube told it‚Äôs fake nooz. /s get tested. 

I little chest cold week recently went got tested. 

Had result less 24 hours nose swab gotten shorter so, it‚Äôs less uncomfortable.  Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuure, bet ""read"" lot :) Oh, agreeing. adding shouldn‚Äôt drop Lysol addition dropping masks. both. right schools daycare trying pass normal cleaning covid precaution misleading. Abbott doesn‚Äôt see sense would probably end court. Hopefully they‚Äôre calling stupid bluff.  Remember beginning CDC whoever said get Covid get again. still true? one seems favorite anti-mask cowboys.  hospitals trying to. area offering massive sign bonuses, trying hire contract/travel nurses, pulling stops hire nurses yet openings remain. There's many nurses; takes years go nursing school even many spots available. 

It's like trained nurses infinite resource /s average person absolutely cares death hospitalization figures. two things reason pandemic thing first place. understand means quote (where title comes from) ""At end day something happened things went sideways... heaven forbid lost child virus, can't blame governor,"" said, noting responsibility decision ""on me."" 

I'm native speaker, syntax seems me. statement? hypothetical? sounds like forgot *if*, ""At end day **if** something happened things went sideways"".

In case quoting hypothesis title serious... People forget us. us vaccinated people positive way thinking gets winning ideology. way happen positive incentives. Negative ones come pushback. unfair alternative reaching heard immunity terrible politicians winning seats running platform get rid penalties.  Thank you. means lot. She‚Äôs much better. dropped college dorm yesterday. Scary she‚Äôs excited. right us. 

I‚Äôm sorry hear son. I‚Äôm worried kids. Especially itty bitty ones teens. ones isolation seems detrimental. Holding space make decision. wanted know understand it‚Äôs simple ‚Äúkeep home!‚Äù life death either way us. Deaths usually lag spike cases weeks Dr. Brilliant.  wish refinement data. tons evidence masks help point, still, would really nice evidence better pinpoint efficacy 

I'm sure ethical considerations preventing lots RCTs, still, frustrating year half thing 1) RCTs 2) real world research really able disentangle impact masks vs. impact behavioral measures ([here's one recent-ish lit review touches upon though important note still suggests masks effective)

The CDC's slides suggested efficacy masking 20-30% individual protection 40-60% source control ([slide again, provide sources differentiate different types masks.

Sorry gripe. definitely know masks provide *some level* protection. wish research better pinpointed (and perhaps I've missed it) agree dawg let‚Äôs bails Understood, care mostly rate spread. I‚Äôm gonna keep mask back pocket next 10 years imo. 

Nothing stop thing changing. Gov shutdowns services schools things really based spread instead deaths seems. 

Just bummed got vaccinated said needed live normally, still can‚Äôt live normally. 

I‚Äôm longer scared dying virus, killing grandma kids virus, there‚Äôs literally control sitting house alone rest life. Okay, look, people say lot. imagine: married person kids whose spouse anti-vaxxer. vaccine. spouse gets really sick million dollars medical bills. happens kids insurance work? 

Or even: adult children are, tragically, anti-vaxxers. vaccine don't. get super sick insurance work declare bankruptcy lose houses. probably incur expenses keep literally starving dying even unwilling much maybe stuck giving retirement eight people little retirement house now. 

And course, social cost lot people bankrupted foreclosed - remember 2008, right? knock-on effects homelessness, child homelessness, big investment firms buying houses rent jack prices, etc. 

It's easy fantasize anti-vaxxers like they're isolated individuals embedded society let financially destroyed effect rest us. 

Also, course, really want ""you caused illness get insurance coverage"" precedent set? think that's going go wrong. Hows vector, Victor? Headline says doctors, text says site limited ""healthcare professionals"". Eh, back day much reading made nearsighted. Triage technical term deciding finite healthcare resources divided. There's medical science what's efficient ethical guidelines make decisions. Different places different ways decide first come first served definitely medically sound judgment. 

Anyway, here, we're even dividing actual resource, OP's dad actually need bed. Surely agree would better able say ""we need Thursday, saves someone's life use Wednesday, go it""? clear say ""you need care today die? Sorry, guy nap could home"" horrible? definitely improved last week, fully unfortunate can't type ""deaths flu"" Google read results. tracking numbers show rate pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations earlier variants, varying 0.1% 1.9% depending state.

You'd surprised. Try working retail food service touristy area, people definitely exist would total hospitalized. [The CDC average 216 children per day hospitalized covid. That's equivalent 3 per million per day. Hey, better lycanthropy! June 2020 University Iowa study published Health Affairs medical journal estimated 200,000 COVID-19 cases prevented May masking mandated several states. experiment, researchers used data analysis models measure community spread mask mandate enacted. Data found within 1-5 days mandate issued, daily case rates dropped nearly one percentage point. Within 21 days, dropped two. Peer reviewed.

Holy shit, got one least dramatic claims I've ever seen anyone make anything. 2% 3 weeks exponentially spreading disease..

I would never go Lollapalooza really hate crowds. reason would never visit live NYC.  heard Lollapalooza, issues fake cards one actually checking vaccine cards tests.  answer wanted, research I've waiting for. Thanks posting. also end situations like Missouri state run mass vaccination sites set within 100 miles either KC St. Louis. officers ""can trusted"" 

Stopped reading right Yo peeps drop best sources vaccines efficacy regards reducing transmission vs people unvaccinated.

I‚Äôm discussion friend whether choosing get vaccine isn‚Äôt selfish opinion largely hinges whether unvaccinated people exacerbate spread virus vaccinated. Even difference recovery time Covid vaxed vs unvaxed factor selfish argument. 

Side question: Hypothetically vaccine found completely ineffective reducing community transmission, people choose get vaccinated leg stand terms calling true individual choice. Thoughts?

Anything got would appreciate. Thank Fuck hospital staff too? Derp, brain even conceive kicking child ICU. right! Four guys walking woods come upon bear, run. One guy asthma though, can't go fast far friends gets eaten bear. pre-existing condition contributed death, die asthma. 

It's thing kids dying covid. pre-existing conditions make easier covid kill them, ICU caught it. Two points. First, vaccine hesitancy inability get vaccine same. want vaccine, multiple, mean multiple, vaccine drives many many cities gone black community neighborhoods give vaccines. work point excuse anymore. life death, many states passed laws regarding employees fired getting vaccine missing days. would big payday got fired.

Second, least served medical community means you? absolve getting vaccine? Again, literally pushes many many cities get African Americans vaccinated coming them. least served medical community mean regards vaccines?

This mantra ""Black people historically mistreated medical community ok want vaccine"" bullshit. vaccine administered anybody wants regardless race. think getting different vaccine black?

I'm done excuses. entire race almost mostly getting vaccine. Either equate race poor people can't take day two (which racist) think hesitancy previous experiments decades ago.

Either way, give fuck. getting vaccine killing people. accept excuse get vaccine now, making seem like legitimate arguments can't furthering idea, thus normalizing killing people ""they least served medical community"". Fuck that.  Okay? I‚Äôm clearly interested conversation maybe take hint lol latest data shows changed past 4 weeks black Hispanic people getting vaccinated higher rates whites. change going forward death lagging number might take time. hanging hat random event. Covid could mutate deadly much less deadly. See selection pressure exists virus kills victim spread. obviously given takes couple weeks actually kill victims right now. vaccine exerting selection pressure transmissible variant that's one spread more.

You're right, think, entirely random unless something gets way favors one mutation another. less lethal mutation favored lethal mutation already takes bit kill someone. people caught dropped dead 3 days, right that's happens. catch it, spread days, symptoms start get serious. even still takes bit longer kills someone. whole time, virus chance spread. faulty argument - car crashes lung cancer spread exponentially don‚Äôt understand would work. Would close borders foreseeable future? You‚Äôre afraid low-risk covid, avoid like plague. you‚Äôre vaccinated, means fear feelings aren‚Äôt based data.

1) Cost living: Consider rural community business refuses invest community considered unprofitable. consider opportunity cost part cost living, rural area may well expensive expensive urban area. However, costs hidden form services products available market. might argue difference GDP simply indirectly accounting differences. I.e., rather viewing GDP additive process, view substantial subtractive component implicit way calculated. reason, direct comparison cost living account differences GDP reflect productivity.

2) describing supply demand. inappropriate describe process sort intentionality is, nature, cumulative process. say, hypothetical, ""decided"" Chef's services valuable, know chef able get certain price services. also seems example given confuses value sense logical necessity (e.g., farmer must produce wheat mill chef prosper) price mechanism. could argue, using logic ""whose jobs would absolutely function first step (growing wheat) done,"" farmer produce wheat begin chef demand wheat. case, turn reasoning head argue chef *is* important part chain, since without incentive produce surplus wheat, farmer would farm chef. even twist reasoning goes far. price mechanism intent, inaccurate think way. people know associate profitability worthiness libertarians, they're clearly wrong thinking. 

3) exactly definition ""real productive"" labor? clear earlier examples probably see farmer working land real productive labor. example suggests people ""head offices"" real productive work. So, challenge define ""real productive"" work provide principled way (1) value work (2) distinguish low level laborer ""head offices"" do. really cautious making sharp lines claiming cities productive/ drivers countries wealth

Don't see mean good thing that, get sick, gain immunity. Population level immunity move this.

It's confusing like said kind pointless compliant people listen least impact displacement post war too. remember Europe basically divided east west right whole Iron Curtain thing. wrong side curtain, even getting home. Can‚Äôt delay person schooling vaccine available kids? though schools last spring, paces mitigating even without state mandate. it‚Äôs apples apples comparison.  know Democrat Republicans? recommended dosage boosters may lower.

Otherwise he's busy nothing  conservative/anti-vax general distrust white people/corporations/the government? they're saying almost nothing

OK, think true. still protecting hospitalization still reduces chance infection symptoms. 

My major complaint talk boosters they're going focus mRNA ones first takers therefore getting focus. Captain Tripps 99% fatal. sucks. scheduled trip New Orleans week back Delta variant (though specifically Jazz fest). thought would past then.

Please go get vaccinated. We‚Äôve know risk obesity year now. large study published last year showed biggest risk factor mortality CoVid wasn‚Äôt heart failure lung disease, obesity. There‚Äôs enough media viral load. 

If I‚Äôm vaccinated Im wearing mask inhale small viral load couple seconds say elevator, might experience either symptoms mild symptoms 

But I‚Äôm fully vaccinated spending 6 hours room mask someone that‚Äôs positive it‚Äôs going BAD TIME regardless vaccination status. Look helping get people vaccinated, giving cop avoid vaccination less lethal crap.

I think time quiet, even realize mRNA vaccine SPIKE PROTEIN VACCINE. mRNA strand code making spike protein. instead another virus insert cell, mRNA directly injected. CDC telling vaccinated folks country mask kind clued us that.

But thanks anyway, guess. agree. That‚Äôs one problems coming against. People fled Germany ended dying neighboring country hard quantify. solution parents choice send kids school jobs outside home? Healthcare workers.

Not quite same. Cooper won‚Äôt. Great leadership. full list states Lambda cases, recorded July 14 GISAID, follows: Arizona (21), Alabama (26), Arkansas (7), California (145) Colorado (10) Connecticut (21) Delaware (1), D.C.

Rhode Island (1), South Carolina (5), Tennessee (16), Texas (22), Utah (13), Vermont (1), Virginia (9), Washington (33), West Virginia (7) Wisconsin (3).

It's here, out-competed Delta. Current vaccines also effective it. Resistance similar Delta. Basically taking precautions Delta Lambda going change anything. Actual percentage breakthroughs arguably higher since symptoms reduced thus they're less likely need treatment seek testing. Finally good news. Usually seems like trouble vaccinated went (I car, take cab appointment) nothing. least end worst-case scenarios. Give vulnerable kids god damn vaccine. Israel it. Fuck FDA. problem DEADLY.

So comparing death rate confounding least two variables, age vaccination status. 

Looking yo double dosed, 220 13.4k died, that's 1.64%. Looking unvaccinated, 131 2337 died, that's 5.6%. vaccination greatly reduces chance death yo group. 

Looking &lt;50 yo group double dosed, 4/15346 died, that's 0.026%. Looking &lt;50 yo group unvaccinated, 34/119k died, that's 0.0285%. vaccination also reduces death rate &lt;50 y/o group.

That sad. interesting see means fewer companies allow employees work home.   constant reminder vaccinated cases almost certainly mild

Right--I'd interested know California's hospital cases per 100k vaccinated vs. unvaccinated residents. true, don‚Äôt vaccinate entire world, get severe mutations regardless. 

If government wants people trust them, they‚Äôve got communicate way builds trust. new mutation comes another country, trust lost.   keep reading posts white Republicans supposedly people refusing take vaccines. Get F outta here. look stats deaths hospitalizations realize doubts across racial minorities well. difference nobody going write article national paper blaming minorities even minor level.

Edit: 1 million total casualty rate, give take, anyone interested. Remember, ""defund"" means ""reallocation"", ""abolation"". think people - especially Redditors - get able scold feel superior others. Sigh. Like know. 

For audience, unvaccinated low hanging fruit right now. Redditors talking masks big deal even pleasurable honestly tone-deaf. I'll wear masks indoors non-social situations (not hanging vaccinated friends though), mean like wearing masks think wearing masks normal big deal. vaccination count qualified immunity.

Besides, goes movies anyway. think opening day streaming options stay. 

At point, stop asking it. see long term thing.  People aren‚Äôt taking chances. like media saying: pandemic focus unvaccinated. #Lambda entered chat think two important differences schools seasonality.

Next list: flu kills children every year! even going about? ever stop worry people got scared getting vaccine? NO! NOT!

What bizarre line thinking! end goal get everyone vaccinated. end goal GET FUCKING PANDEMIC. would possibly care comes result mass vaccination beneficial mutation? kind bizarro world this?   Basically true things. Everyone actually involved something says media coverage thing bad. Pandemic, politics, sports, science general. almost media ecosystem actually bad covering things. mom straight said, ""if die time go."" compared chances dying getting car accident. go walk traffic. can't believe selfish is. Fuck friends, family, children grandchildren, right? responding? never meant conversation, PSA. like edumacated. It‚Äôs taking vaccine first shot away rest world.

In cases suspect case. shots sitting pharmacies US likely going sit go bad used locally. There's scenario half-dose boosters approved quickly given new ones ordered take away exported doses, odds seem pretty you‚Äôre likely see new , dangerous variant coming another nation

Absolutely. Getting first doses everyone world priority. nobody charge anything actually cares make one. qualify don‚Äôt get machine, what‚Äôs they‚Äôre mortality rate? it‚Äôs 80%, it‚Äôs saving bunch lives no? like year half prepare  two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive literally nowhere chain state that. Since obviously break you, responding comment stated: 

‚ÄúIf virus continues mutate‚Äù

Which response to:

‚ÄúAnd *why* would end?‚Äù

This really isn‚Äôt difficult. really. last variants mitigation strategies place primarily masking social distancing. don‚Äôt now, it‚Äôs hard compare. school board meeting Baton Rouge, LA, several parents asked delaying start school given response. Give 3-4 weeks. many cases shut down. availability, CVS Walgreens parts, appointments wide open. 

Not drug stores every supermarket/grocery store around shots literally one getting them. appointment needed, walk get shot wait. state-sponsored free rideshare services advertised everywhere car far walk take public transit. excuse vaccinated point. care. massive swathes people country give two flying fucks welfare people next them. Ah got it! Thanks help info ever stop think maybe lethal variant scared everyone getting vaccine could, know, actually prevent happening? thought ever cross mind? disgusting. parents get vaccines expect see new grandson. really wish sister would tell no. hard come terms realizing selfish really are. There's also fact tend work jobs PTO, sick days, vacation days. So, miss days work due possible side effects vaccine, that's money lost pockets. 

If families raise, they're also less likely able get vaccine work hours. cars, get clinics/pharmacies? pay-per-click, they're literally incentivized fear-monger. media always way certain degree, internet made problem much, much worse. Netherlands spiked 418 cases day 10k within 2.5 weeks reopening. Nightclubs shut again. Please don‚Äôt spread misinformation. Cases 2.5k day.  State? Speaking putting machine soon enough. Former colleague mine got bad case Covid hospital; sedated much sooner beginning pandemic, told wife.

RSV worse infants  BMI pregnant risk factors easy see. Imagine many people don‚Äôt realize hypertensive, undiagnosed diabetes, asthmatic, former smokers‚Ä¶. high risk severe complications. irresponsible step up, strong hand decent people must make them!! 'freedoms"" comes responsibility cowboy!! called ""freedoms"" end safety loved ones begins! Got Scooter? Thanks anti vaxxers mutates completely evades vaccine, longer harmful fear-mongering.

Yes know, insisted less lethal variant could appear without accepting fact lethal variant COULD ALSO APPEAR. equally probable. least I've honest it. simply publish data today give vaccines EUA parents could decide school starts. I‚Äôd 11 year old first line. strain combined two different strains.



That's works... get that. Let‚Äôs get rage USA would rather horde vaccine unwilling dummies rather sharing world. Extremely interesting, could also mean future vaccines would updated pronto developed time combat next variants. Someone posted thread RSV went around daycare last weeks nothing fuck around with. 2 kids got put oxygen Anti-vaxxers live world nearly eradicated horrible diseases thanks vaccines. They've never lived horrors smallpox polio species able vaccinate them. lens naivety anti-vaxxer falsely interprets reality. dumb, there‚Äôs claiming teachers aren‚Äôt elderly.

Are trying provide evidence you‚Äôve never set foot school? 

Here much concise way could sum overall point‚Ä¶

Waahhhh!! many people die meantime big question.

Very vaccinated. mention less people work weeks, less hospitalizations, less people ICUs, less long Covid. want take ""experimental"" vaccine, yet get covid take every experimental drug treatment get well again. possible think people idiots, rather people? variants immunocompromised people extended infections selected virus immune evasion, somehow spread people. Thanks  Sure, state surplus vaccines due breathtaking number suicidal asshats murderous intent witch led 80k doses expiring.  Even American Academy Pediatrics [telling get ass, using nicer understand FDA recently worked Pfizer Moderna double number children ages 5-11 years included clinical trials COVID-19 vaccines. appreciate prudent step gather safety data, urge FDA carefully consider impact decision timeline authorizing vaccine age group. view, rise Delta variant changes risk-benefit analysis authorizing vaccines children. FDA strongly consider authorizing vaccines children ages 5-11 years based data initial enrolled cohort, already available, continuing follow safety data expanded cohort post-market setting. approach would slow time authorization critically needed vaccines 5‚Äì11-year age group. lots swearing ‚Ä¶. mean, record number hospitalizations among kids would seem indicate hitting harder. mean call liar too, reality LMAO  Recombination already documented used phylogenetic network approach study origin VOC202012/01 (alpha) so-called UK variant (PANGO Lineage B.1.1.7). multiple network analyses using different methods consistently revealed VOC202012/01 variant result recombination, contrast common assumption variant evolved step-wise mutations linear Two variants SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus causes covid-19 combined genomes form heavily mutated hybrid version virus. ‚Äúrecombination‚Äù event discovered virus sample California, provoking warnings may poised enter new phase hybrid virus result recombination highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant discovered UK B.1.429 variant originated California may responsible recent wave cases Los Angeles carries mutation making resistant might unlikely Delta combine lethal/vaccine resistant variant, impossible. Original studies looked effectiveness vaccine reducing symptoms stopping deaths. Later studies shown mrna vaccines 90+% effective keeping vaccinated getting sick altogether nit even asymptomatic, infected. vaccine wears time though, might need boosters soon. future try civil referring antibiotic-resistant bacteria. grown understand bacteria feelings too, inappropriate refer ""tough mother blankers"". take moment reflect bigotry towards certain types bacteria, including tuberculosis. hope learn grow respect _all_ bacteria.

Now step back, listen. Mads respect boy Gottlieb cases went Netherlands UK reopening everything, see would different case  less lethal variant could appear.

Another factor lower income people still go work upper income people jobs mostly home.

Another reason Latinos hit hard contribute lot agricultural workforce.

They would go work, without much protection pandemic, get sick. would bring back families.

But white collar workplaces (typically higher income) shut people worked home. know people quitting rather getting vaccinated

COVID-19 spread aerosolized particles droplets. Masks block droplets well, achieving 40% effectiveness rate preventing spread disease real world.

No one trying make disease go away, trying mitigate worst impacts becomes endemic. cannot stop spread, sure slow down.

We're things virus others dramatically increased fatality rate similar diseases.

Antibody-dependent enhancement real risk clinical trials showed happen vaccines.

Vitamin studies inconclusive. Ivermectin studies inconclusive. Zinc studies inconclusive. anecdotal experience using unapproved therapies means nothing. Yes, amazing! like odds #3. Boost up!! Ten year Army vet here. friend prolly lying. tell exactly getting hand.  18 showing deaths vaccinated unvaccinated. Anyone thoughts this? hope go festival day‚Ä¶. Great atmosphere. Usually good people bands. enlisted, bunch mandatory vaccines including anthrax smallpox.

I also covid vaccine, side effects anthrax worse covid shot. 

They suck deal. many people say gladly take bullet country won‚Äôt even take needle arm fellow citizens. Texas new Florida?  media toxic. takes truly demented person relish scaring shit regular people. true! polio vaccine actually keeps getting polio, unlike emergency use Covid vaccine!  Texas here. parents taught teach kids. Even something simple drive gas station asshole pulls ""music"" blaring loudly door windows open enjoy. pushing freedom onto mine. right. ‚ÄúI normally believe vaccines one developed quickly‚Äù ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs something fishy it‚Äù things I‚Äôve heard otherwise normal people. news watching? never inferred that.

It cdc mentioned vaccinated optional mask month later mask mentioned earlier year fully vaccinated least likely transmit virus saying fully vaccinated spread virus much unvaccinated? call changing weather? Yes, things change back fourth, creates frustration yea. think also life. tried suburbs, single social life meetup events, found city better spot (although miss outdoor space/room home office). 85 kids. early indicator quickly delta variant going spread schools even hospitalization rate lower adults still presents huge problem. issue limited number hospital beds. delta spreading quickly hospitals already running ICU beds school year even started places. Houston already ran hospital beds, many counties Florida ICU beds, places Missouri ran ventilators 4th July.

Even students contract virus end hospital, infect others. hospitals many places already operating edge capacity huge problem, covid patients. emergency come much greater chance death lack available medical care. Remember flatten curve stuff everyone seems forgotten about...well that's need again. can‚Äôt launch ship without infecting thousands troops endangering mission can‚Äôt launch ship general. risk outbreaks would massive military setback requiring vaccines military imperative. responding ""sky falling"" comment hypocrite mean private/public health? Like people decide measures (masking, distancing, etc)?  It‚Äôs crazy Newsom getting recalled state heavily Democratic DeSantis getting recalled state .4% seen lace masks! [Press release May 10, two weeks dosed first sub deaths distributed across US concentrated certain states?

No political statements please weirdest thing I‚Äôve read while. Also UK incredibly short PPE medical staff strong thread anti-mask wearing suggestion avoid making worse everyone wanting them. hope lying getting vaccine trying soft pedal criticism pretending opposed boosters. think quite likely. think make appear less unhinged posting thread whining 3rd shots. Dollars donuts one dose covid vaccine. Interestingly, Moderna's normal vaccine 3 times higher Pfizer ([100 micrograms vs 30 may explain people tend side effects Moderna). booster would still higher dose Pfizer's normal dose. Well done, soldier. brainwashed?

Yes shitshow here. I'm appalled many people walk around naked faces Everyone family friend circle fully vaxxed thank God think father's condition he'd survive breakthrough infection.

There packed children's hospitals schools started days ago. equipment districts afford accurate start with.

ugh. get started. beginning covid temp checks still thought good practice, offered buy school 5 thermometers reputable US based company makes thermometers industrial, food safety, health.  told sent link cheap Chinese thermometer Amazon ""that school nurse said buy."" like pointed out. fake argument claim make.. stupid claim.

So normally someone could easily infer ""assume everyone currently infected deaths still take months"" tried argue against.

So trying argue stupid possible interpretation pedantic stated.

just like argued ""delta airlines deadly""... point obvious im refering delta strain covid-19, arguing would equally pedantic. Yup, I've done it. amount deciphering pregnancy test (one hoping positive, lolol)  Also, theory apparently surprisingly high rate cancer remission surgery back partly surgery followed rampant infections attendant dangerously high body temperatures. survived it, quite possible cancer cells not. Actually...I almost want see happen work you? display placeholder page(at least Poland) know responded facts presented with, sure, say I'm one acting like tucker carlson. US get 2 OTC self test kits local drug stores like CVS. reliable PCR super easy. sure Biden CNN said that? Perhaps context said research uncovered yet? think important honest breakthrough cases happening regularity. know four people right vaccinated positive/symptomatic. 

However - experiencing mildly inconvenient disease - sniffles, headache, fatigue. Nothing more. 

I also know someone unvaccinated infected going day 8 absolute misery. Worse, coworker's daughter - unvaccinated otherwise healthy - lost life couple weeks ago. 30s two young children. 

Get vaccinated!  Someone told gives Legionnaire's disease.  simple google search 30 seconds proved wrong, many people see something debunkable pass along? many wear masks. exactly. work healthcare highly doubt general public masking working well think does. good RCT conducted one got censored much journal would even WILLING publish it. study found little difference infection rates two groups, btw. Also, SARS COV 2 spread aerosols, small enough go around masks, including surgical masks. patient settings, use fitted sterilized N95s eye protection prevent spread.

Now, I'm ""anti-masker"". good, non-refutable evidence slow mostly prevent transmission SARS-COV 2 implemented alone general public (we look cities re-instated recently since think put safety measures. vaccination rates would add noise data well), would happily one despite fact vaccinated. is, way determining whether masks combination mitigation measures implemented slowed spread disease. Considering masking go-to mandate cities feel slightest public pressure ""something"", would think would ample pressure scientists proper RCT determine actually effective. Especially Delta spreading even relatively high vaccination areas. Mission accomplished, sir! Posted another person:
Right, covid way higher 99.9% survival rate? pointless arguing people. better point helped kill half million Americans. ever pretend kind patriot love America.

So, guess options get vaccine get less honorable conditions. Well, Vincent considered one leading virologists country. 40+ years experience. Plus, podcast him, regularly co-hosts (the videos Dr Daniel Griffin especially informative). videos / podcasts typically easy listen (even they‚Äôre long) good job explaining things also good sense humor. doesn‚Äôt paint perfectly rosey picture it‚Äôs certainly balanced he‚Äôs afraid call bullshit. Federal Contractor here, military even. company forcing vaccinations. two months ago one guys tested positive. Two crews exposed him. vaccinated expected continue work vaccinated got two weeks work. Paid. 
That said. imagine company mandated vaccinations follow asap troops getting it. Well that's summer peaks hit south. pattern existed last year.

Doesn't change fact current surge south, across much HHS Region 4, bad 2020 many states worse others. notably places, particularly Louisiana Florida, spike substantially steeper past well.

Louisiana went ~40 new hospitalizations per day beginning July 400 new hospitalizations per day yesterday. fall/winter surge took several months climb ~70 new hospitalizations per day ~270 (the previous peak).

It's nationwide right current hotspots hotter they've ever been. Tell Florida kids getting sick come back two weeks tell
Me statement, English major. going mislead statistics least transparently. kids vulnerable greater danger unvaccinated? body temperature went 1 point next day hours bed, felt tiny bit crawly. That‚Äôs it. Perfectly normal next day. 

Bring on! Exponential growth still exponential growth, matter curve moment.

The numbers (can) get really big really fast. cases double 10 times, that's thousand times many cases, e.g. doubling every week, that's two half months. Stop making stuff up. can't initiate paperwork reason someone either.

No commander willfully breaking federal law military needed many bodies possible. judge needs stay hell lane. bazillion Bill Bell terms, real breath fresh air.  get better without difficulty, reinforce belief even spread group. Right? Like, unless confirmed actively hurt me, can't see negative it. Note ""116 year old law"" referencing ""mandate vaccine"". say ""If refuse vaccinated, pay fine."" (which Henning Jacobson did). 

The Atlantic recently great podcast episode thing: Atlantic really good podcast recently: Employers make vaccination ""condition employment"".. simply effective (since people typically unwilling throw away good job). People talk big talk. push comes shove, likely get shot means keeping job. (at least,. I'd wager significant amount people will. likely hear stories ""vocal minority"" quitting jobs.. small percentage overall employed). i‚Äôm saying comment white ‚Äòsums up‚Äô racist. Like didn‚Äôt mention hair shirt colour, decided skin colour important ü§î people take seriously, care consequences others.

Also, believe hospitals lying full. 

It's sad. fucking balls Texas.  thing is, actually go twat. asked her, politely could, mask up. twat started screaming asked her, politely, mask spawn. call either one twat spawn time, trying get cooperate. went nuts anyway. top everything else listen lecture fucking dentist dental clinic spent 500,000 USD ACs cleaned air. Frankly, care less. Talking day, hate talking it. teach 2nd grade talk lot. also tough time hearing kids read wear masks, realized lot lip reading. But, oh well. Masks worth person, doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt hate it! I‚Äôve tried many masks.

My day 8:45-3:45 classroom adult. RW blaming minorities illegal immigrants. grandmother can't complete conversation without mentioning ""the massive amount infected illegals"" coming ""Being sent place Biden spreading virus"". 

It's nuts. Media sucks big time, 100,000 cases/day likelihood mutations getting real. also selective pressure virus mutate evade vaccines hodgepodge 50% vaccinated 50% unvaccinated groups. Yeah.....I unfortunately like family :(  Note non-Texans - County Judge quoted like County Executive states, like mayor county. judge judicial sense. Sure, don‚Äôt get bad time miss booster? Get 6 months road. whole thing absurd we‚Äôll COVID protocols next (however long humans around). CDC keeping track breakthroughs warranting hospitalization. lack hardcore data, studies like best have. Moreover, without data, eye test comes in, high profile Incidents seemingly weekly breakthrough cases, California reports 19% breakthrough, need change behavior fresh guidance. Sure, fair enough. 'have to' meant individual's perspective. little motivation go get tested symptoms. probably many shots kid traveling another country?  difference talked constantly. Please let fear take you, risks manifold contract virus versus getting vaccine.  may indeed save life. Millions taken shot already, included. Twice.  yourself. telling picture isn‚Äôt old white guy truck ? third time today posted that. answer you. could number things. Stay safe! narrow exceptions almost entirely judge made, subsets said common law doctrines. Legislatures can't make exceptions without triggering strict scrutiny law inevitably gets challenged.

Not mention law relied ""substantial harm"" action speech would immediately struck since truthful statements often cause substantial harm individual. would classic prior restraint. Intentionally incorrect might past muster, would probably narrowed something like ""medical advice"" would difficult prove court, versus genuine belief. that's 99% information systems *mis*informative

most us continuing educations every day.

if tune fox news, cnn, msnbc, mainstream outlets TV &amp; radio, getting fed misinformation steady drip  would pick entirely different spike protein, another closely related coronavirus (which possible). see how, mutagenesis alone, current spike protein, virus would maintain ability bind ACE2 receptor, simultaneously evade antibodies vaccines, antibodies possible motifs spike protein. hope Pisces variant drown far right. Yes, stage hit tipping point much population vaccinated EXPECT large proportion infections represented breakthroughs. quite simply vaccinated individuals infection occur unvaccinated individuals.

You're much better comparing relative caseload within respective populations. look another 70% vaccinated community widespread transmission delta capturing data suggests case rate ~8x higher amongst unvaccinated despite vaccinated individuals still making fair proportion new cases. Genuinely curious. 

What's harm getting extra shot vaccine right now?

I two doses AZ me, that's clearly good. lot world fine mixing Pfizer. *Shouldn't* get dose Pfizer increase chances surviving school season?  article includes excellent quote relevant smallpox-era Supreme Court Case. Here's fuller is, course, sphere within individual may assert supremacy rightfully dispute authority human government, especially free government existing written constitution, interfere exercise will. equally true that, every well ordered society charged duty conserving safety members rights individual respect liberty may times, pressure great dangers, subjected restraint, enforced reasonable regulations, safety general public may demand.   manifold restraints every person necessarily subject common good. basis, organized society could exist safety members.

\- Justice John Marshall Harlan, [Jacobson v. Massachusetts Hi. know I'm gonna popular I've question wondering anyone could shed light it. 

My partner fully vaccinated since February (Pfizer) unvaccinated. share bed every night. 10 days ago started showing symptoms coughing, sneezing, fever, chills, loss appetite poor sleep. shared symptoms lesser degree. 

Last Saturday got tested. covid positive, covid negative. Since I've slept couch cared distance. 

I got retested Tuesday (negative), Friday (negative). partner upset catching covid, also upset despite getting vaccinated. 

Is reason this? 

I anti-vaccination, confidence first answer correct one. I'm waiting hoping new vaccine supersede current options Eh. lot people barely see person serving coffee cooking burgers people.

I guessed little kids told suck hope next teacher croak too. needs major outreach efforts explain long term problems vaccinations happen. Always people bad reaction within first month, long term complications initial issue. never case issues crop 5 10 years later without problem time vaccination. 

Now hundreds millions people taken data say extremely safe.  jackasses obviously don‚Äôt care communities Yes, this. natural selection works. virus know vax vs unvaxed individual. Random mutations occur, leading survival advantage vaxed unvaxed individuals alike. chance virus infect people (who likely unvaxed) greater number mutations occur, leading variants escape vaccine. think copied reply meant me. read CDC link though. 75-85 effectiveness figure model assumption, finding. tell, enough data get good handle effectiveness infection delta. clearly dropped lot ~90% rate alpha vaccine trials.  reminds [this viral woman went kid mother. child looked distraught end, feel her, feel mom more.

In scenarjo vaccinate 95% population vaccine, delta variant would R one. means epidemic would slowly dwindling through, means less cases, means less possibility variants.

Even less optimistic scenarios 80% vaccinated, effective R would fall something like 1.1/1.2 like flu, would much manageable. Again, lower number infection would mean much lower chance new variants.

Right says covid deaths 0-17 years old 350 deaths nationwide. 0-17 years old deaths causes 51,000 yes that‚Äôs typo. 49,000 reasons lose critical thinking start saving them. many children die year starvation like 2-3 million? 5-10,000 children starve daily. Find place world covid taken many children us year. Seriously people keep acting like cared death .1 % weakest us affected. didn‚Äôt care many people dying elsewhere tv told too. Vaccines good useful long properly tested data confirms it.  Back days hot topic people actually questioned usefulness surgeons responding surgeons wore mask sole purpose respecting tradition"" also interesting part. There's need spread fear unnecessarily. leading indicators lead believe happen beyond normal rhythms economy? consensus prevalence long covid among people vaccinated?

I fully vaccinated risk serious illness/hospitalization scares me, it‚Äôs long covid absolutely terrifies me. seen reports people still get long covid mild infections, believe mostly among unvaccinated. conclusive info risk people breakthrough infections developing long covid? swab shit hurts. Better Rona though. Got vaccine soon as. 4.4 billion vaccines given.. count impressed never occurred OTC medications might require FDA approval...... probably bit lower Republicans. Globally? Absolutely, hard thing either. still long road ahead. Even started affecting kids continue wear mask people immunocompromised. realize people like inconvenienced, look other.  Midwest early too, nearby districts started last week, least one started last week July. don‚Äôt start 16th buddy moved FL escape CA mask nonsense, he's Covid nightmare land. many Covid killed? find ironic news media pushing narrative last year BLM didn‚Äôt spread Covid whatsoever actually helped absolutely ridiculous.

Is reason believe state data better job CDC data collecting complete race stats vaccinations?

The CDC race information 60% vaccinations. BIG assumption said missing data would evenly spread across races.

So want critique info presented survey data, I'd recommend really hard look data operating guess known would turn ideological war 

That's response? guy who's leading comment involves ideology saying others made ideological war? true. again, considering experiencing fatalities resource constraints par world war, that's hardly surprising. Human beings died. but‚Ä¶.it‚Äôs people aren‚Äôt vaccinated blaming. Vaccinated people spread that‚Äôs different /s think voted government power still thinks best ever? Hell, half even admit side lost last election. I'm assured many people totally fine. Technically influenza 0 recombination. reassortment. think negative (-) RNA virus use recombination might wrong. sure downvoted question. 

You correct, 12+ get vaccine right now. Hence problem--school start beating 12 vaccine timeline. Daytona here. 1% two weeks ago, 10% last week, maybe 25% yesterday. Try getting retail food service night week, computer parts, new cars, lumber. crash supply chains labor still really hurting. Free = dead? uncharacteristic surges long opening up, presumed due lack normal exposure

Not sure understand part, expand it? mean normally would level ""herd immunity"" exist now? Yup, that's cold hard truth. We've got years ahead us, human nature simply allow us deal situation way. Well, wife catched Covid work (nurse), sleeping bed, watching tv together sofa eating food next every day - get sick, tested 2 times PCR vaccinated federal level Trump last year. could taken seriously encouraged proper precautions/dispelled conspiracy. Instead allowed politicized state local levels keeping torch burning even brighter.

Children *did* get sick, know any.  amazing much lot shape/unhealthy looking people overestimate immune system

That‚Äôs typical protocol safety children susceptible drugs. make sure it‚Äôs safe adults start successively lower aged trials become comfortable safety older groups. also figure dosing age group

I want start prefacing conversation something like ""I'm wearing mask fully vaccinated.

Moderna trial. BP stable before.  here's hypothetical question then.

You've got one ICU bed left. give person got vaccinated, wore mask, followed rules got Covid anyway? 

Or person listened Uncle Gus Facebook, convinced others get vaccinated, refused wear mask ""freedom"" somehow still refuses accept reality situation?

There's good answer question, know. heart breaks medical staff hypothetical. real situation finite resources needs criteria guides they're allocated. unreasonable people prefer give resources unlucky rather choice chose poorly.  see endgame unvaxxed dying and/or enough families seeing loved one die get vaccine. don‚Äôt think there‚Äôll mutation allows us live  Yeah crazy logic. ü•≥ trash; I'm vegan got shots; even cross mind. even actually vegan anti-vaxxers I've seen try make refusal anything veganism.

Most importantly covers kids young enough vaccinated yet. Even critical Deep South's medical system already pushed limits. People hear Covid beds occupied hospital think ""why make room"", covid protocols requires extra space quarantine patients people already sick get worse.

Symptom burden appears increase age, also seen persistent symptoms acute infection, beyond 28 56 days. **This would reaffirm children least likely suffer prolonged symptoms acute infection, indeed absolute rates children symptoms beyond 28 days (4.4%) 56 days (1.8%) low.** Whilst children negative test results less likely suffer prolonged symptoms (0.9% 28 days), interestingly cohort higher symptom burden testing positive SARS-CoV-2. **Severe symptoms appear rare.**

Emphasis mine. Original  Yea really imagine everyone took serious have? I've way. bet number dead would halved might never heard Delta!!

Well are. beginning. Schools reopen August many places, see pediatric hospitals getting full.  Same. I'm terrified school starting tomorrow. mask mandates. Maybe I'm missing something, regardless whether said accurate not, this? Nothing article seems mention race, see pictures church goers, idk think 6 died black FYI anyone possibly lumping officials single bucket, Fauci strongly supports vaccine mandates. lacks authority execute them, however.

FDA absolutely going slower child vaccines adult regulatory agency asking four six months safety follow-up data kids age 12, FDA official said. two months follow-up data required clinical trials make sound like vaccine makers filed paperwork yet. FDA telling _can't_ file paperwork yet.

And plenty knowledgeable people risks children exposed to, example American Academy Pediatrics, telling FDA hurry hell up. understand FDA recently worked Pfizer Moderna double number children ages 5-11yearsincluded clinical trials COVID-19 vaccines. appreciate prudent step gather safety data, urge FDA carefully consider impact decision timeline authorizing vaccine age group. view, rise Delta variant changes risk-benefit analysis authorizing vaccines 
children. FDA strongly consider authorizing vaccines children ages 5-11 years based data initial enrolled cohort, already available, continuing follow safety data expanded cohort post-market setting.This approach would slow time authorization critically needed vaccines 5‚Äì11-year age group. addition, FDA continues evaluate clinical trial requirements children 5 years, similarly urge FDA carefully consider impact regulatory decisions delays availability vaccines age group.Based scientific data currently available COVID-19 vaccines, well 70 years vaccinology knowledge pediatric population, Academy believes clinical trials children safely conducted 2-month safety follow-up participants

Hundreds children die FDA overly cautious vaccine hundreds millions doses given already.

But sure, random person internet, feel free Christ, I'm sick people never taken part process saying uninformed garbage.

to pediatricians. stop contrarianism, support universal vaccines, let end it. It‚Äôs hard  rural areas! Yes! I‚Äôll sign fucking iron clad waiver. cannot live worry Chill doom? Even doom inconvenient truth? article convinced pull daughter out. got mask, bottle hand sanitizer, peace mind free mine rate going NE, would say could easily doubled. Imagine people still circulating restaurants bars? completely shut whole sectors economy here. New Zealand disagrees yes, think anyone antivax and/or antimask selfish

but media tries push idea white Republicans blame vast majority antivaxxers Black Hispanic bunch idiots. got deserved. I'm UK I've heard also seeing spike paediatric respiratory virus infections like flu RSV. Maybe lockdowns school closures limiting exposure viruses, schools opened/lockdown restrictions ended less immunity. may direct result lockdowns. case pointless laying blame. restrictions tight would COVID infections, flipside we're seeing pathogens causing disease. Let's face it, pandemic shitty situation round.   FYI, Nose Frida irritates nose causes inflammation swelling, making harder breathe mouth. Sitting bathroom shower hot door closed room steams better idea. (Don't go hot shower baby, obviously, want steam drain sinuses) Pretty ignorant take. situation Israel perfect example herd immunity basically impossible virus global society refuse lock overwhelming majority countries poor nonexistant vaccination rates. delta variant exploded India could still fly Mumbai LAX; still can. Oh lifted mask mandates vaccinated people. situation equally fault vaccinated folks much unvaccinated. 

Anti-vaxxers spread stupidity selfish actions. Vaccinated folks got shot thought virus them, went back bars social functions maskless, spreading like wildfire. Two sides shit dipped coin. highly contagious Delta variant largely blame surge, APH officials said,

Seems Delta getting bunch blame deserve. Yes, contagious - hospitals overwhelmed like people got vaxxed, wore masks, stayed away other. go blaming everything Delta least half blame lies people's actions. Good kids, least denier teachers sort immunity schools reopen. Good New Orleans. Louisiana higher 7 day COVID infection average even summer winter 2020. remember Mardi Gras 2020 caused spike infections Louisiana. ECDC really need get act together get something Europe going. mention life normal flu statistics. lockdown, masks, social distancing, nothing. neighbor died pneumonia (not sure Covid) nearby open beds thanks surge area. love Georgia much become massive graveyard this. Annnnnnd, saved. Thank you. least technology improving, one silver linings whole pandemic.

Quick Google search +mRNA, trials latter predates covid, platform given huge boost course. Nice may see real progress space time. Yeah, I'd cut fools too. point, becomes matter self preservation,both mental physical. Ya really sync ""leader free world"" marketing it? pisses see vaccinated people refusing wear masks. There's lot ""I right things I'm punished still forced wear mask save unvaccinated people care"" Reddit elsewhere. 

Kids can't get vaccinated yet. Vaccinated adults breakthrough infections still infect kids, kids could die end lifelong health problems.

Please wear mask, vaccinated not.  teach optimistic convinced trying fix social security killing old folks.. killing kids doesnt really mesh conspiracy theory.. 

It ony leads think one thing.. Birds arent real! political thread reddit that's full morons like bashing away straw men, audacity claim logical fallacy. total piece shit are. hard imagine people stuffed ovens idiots like running around convinced everyone's breath become Lethal Weapon. fucking moronic, listen yourself. 2021 plenty good science available, think vaccine that's going protect you, take go business. Nothing comment logical, everything vaccine arguments appeal authority. Covid De Santis, wait, De Sanctimonious hit. 

It happens. Thank god Reality hit, time cultist decided LEAST take care CHILREN, fucking um... BORN. got vax, I'm defensed.  FDR urging people do, actually? Stick wartime rations, anything rash? covid directive obvious, stay home, distance, mask - urge people times actual war? need 5 shots tho? 

Isn't bit excessive? Source?

Yes, please, give us source. I'm going continue part prevent spread. I'm still trial, although we've dropped masks work vaccinated, I'm wearing mine again. Whatever takes. idea patriotism whatever serves time. loyalty. Well, example, Pacific islanders. You‚Äôre acting like hearts morals. Don‚Äôt naive. know they‚Äôre blame others simply don‚Äôt care. actually fallen last two weeks shopping; know us switched home delivery prime tho People think covid like chickenpox 

People realise chickenpox kill children well adults. It‚Äôs district town near LA Yeah agree you. Influenza isn‚Äôt infectious. Barely R1 that. Masks little bit distance shut down. nurses quit. put risk unvaccinated idiots couldn‚Äôt bothered wear piece cloth mouth? don‚Äôt think businesses workplaces reason know personal health data. It‚Äôs pretty slippery slope.   *still* masking up.

Doesn't look that's changing anytime soon either.

People stubborn hell.  things said, repeated experts interviewed news Belgium. least believe correlation severe dementia covid. 
They think might patients, obviously, keep forgetting rules social distance, masking up, washing hands,‚Ä¶

And boosters: said, claim old people long term health issues respond well vaccines thus need booster shot. hopeful 1 shot enough. Thanks missed paper, useful. wish showed absolute numbers instead percentage though, natural infection would start lower. interpolate across studies would seem end roughly spot? ‚ÄúPlenty‚Äù. offense, type imprecise qualifier could used justify anything. 33/100000 33/750. current rate, would expect .2475 cases per day hypothetical school 750 Yes! It‚Äôs also clear number children per million expect get Covid don‚Äôt vaccinate gone lot delta. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs true, haven‚Äôt heard Texas judges asking residents step due staffing problems.

I think arrhythmia finally corrected. sudden minutes ago felt better, clear-headed, like finally getting proper oxygen. checked yet though. 3 days utter BS lol. taking longer go back NSR. Thanks Lucifer [Google ! playing devil's advocate, what's probability courts mandating people certain health care skills return work they've stepped away profession? they're going likely mandate vaccines FDA approval, what's stop government requiring conscription health care workers?? Covid well vaccine reactivate shingles people well. sucksss. many different contradicting reports.. one particular seem considering delta variant seems causing lot hospitalizations children. tend remind virus still relatively new changing Nope pay them;)  Yeah ‚Äî it‚Äôs heartbreaking family total idiots. It‚Äôs tragic, don‚Äôt feel sorry people. Republicans full culture warriors popular policy ideas. Even seems policy battle larger culture war. never understand argument. old think 5 year old‚Äôs parents are? Maybe grandparents great grandparents, parents‚Ä¶   Hospitalized 7 day average 831

At peak eight months ago 7,011 eviction moratorium get lifted last week also? ....it's almost governor decided Texas many citizens.... Happy Birthday! I‚Äôd interested read many kids died left unsupervised versus many died covid. Ugh, want avoid. Hoping Pfizer backs up. can‚Äôt make judgment based this. However given forms cases reduced frequency, would intuitive population would infected without vaccination shifted toward milder end severity graph.

Given person voluntarily got tested symptoms vaccinated, way surprised symptoms seem mild? Doctors going help likely survive.

You deny treatment someone overdosed taking drugs. deny someone antibiotics wear condom. can't tell someone treat broken leg climbed tree dare. treat best care can.

I get people angry upset get vaccinated. person made choices. people absolutely believe trackers vaccine, terrified vaccine cause harm way. fully brainwashed news/media/friends/family. Maybe even worried they'll disowned community get vaccine. society problem.

But absolutely CANT deny medical treatment someone stupid... immoral. doctor would get license revoked that's scary thought I'm wearing mask every flu season end days. fucking hate flu. mask flu season? people actually like getting sick spreading around like fucking morons? ""Some people"" roughly means 30 45 percent Americans, anyone keeping track.   Masters Education (secondary Language Arts) fuck teaching children. I‚Äôm world‚Äôs worst teacher comes disciplined education spawn. swear every day look sub headlines somehow get exponentially worse private school? I'm LA know school already started. I'm scared September schools open up. I'm far downtown santa monica scares/annoys see people w/o mask crowded area.  able father dying past fall. attend small family funeral lived across country safe travel. family decided memorial service August thinking would safe then, memorial service Florida last week risk harming community traveling selfish needs. Like, understand need go small events (outdoors, vaccinated people, distance masks etc.). literally INSIDE packed clubs. enormous gatherings people like music festivals?? unnecessary Idea people feel remotely safe that. Even eating doors feels extremely risky nowadays. straight lying inconvenienced. true selfishness Fuck‚Äôem. thought children couldnt get teenagers adults  Hearing 5 shots makes want 3rd. Stay safe! susceptible Covid-19 along. 4.1 million children diagnosed Covid-19 since beginning pandemic, accounting 14.3 percent cases, according latest data American Academy July 15 July 29, percentage rose 19 percent weekly reported good communicating routine thought.  Wait till skip Greek letter Xi. already excuse approval fast. Why‚Ä¶why would surprising all? J&amp;J efficacy around 70%?

I‚Äôm baffled think people would shocked given stats phase 3 trials? Children can't vaccinated yet. vaccine tested actual children. Teens, sure, children. Yeah 6th street probably packed every night haha Oh, doctor? Counterpoint: parts US verge mass casualty events, yet percent (5%?) unvaccinated population places cared enough take 15 minutes day last month stop it.

You call good news want; guess number could even lower. call sus AF.  Interesting, age group? term BIPOC, 'I' stands ""Indigenous"". He's saying person claiming BIPOC people can't get vaccine leave Indigenous people got vaccine. Good luck parents. fucking idiot dad said last week!!! hate much Yeah, 20 minutes total minus 10-ish minutes waited after. scrolled phone left. honestly feel religious leaders certain groups disparaged stains, always nice see genuinely good people running churches I'm Taurus ‚ôâ üí´üíû saying regularly body temperature qualifies low-grade fever, see doctor (it could caused underlying problem, probably get note explaining that's permanent condition would allow get vaccinated). 

If high temperature now, likely there's mild infection going on, best let calm vaccinating.

They quite strict guidelines, slightly could considered normal. ""A new grandson"" can't vaccinated. Believe may actually care human them, especially new child. eligible person isn‚Äôt vaxxed point insanely stupid. Fauci wasting breath trying talk like they‚Äôre adults functioning brains. Time Plan B dumpster fire figure ship ignorant petri dishes. Hospital administration says hold beer. Ok get it. willing sacrifice many kids takes live life want. Moloch pleased you. There's quite bit report repeated infections. count called 'covid parties' get immunity. Yep, clear, NEED every one citizens survive. thinking hard this. bar set low comes IQ required anti-vaxxer. Yeah, that's lie tell us well. Hey there. I'm shop owner. Audio Electrical concerts festivals. fucked me/us hard can't even really describe it. necessarily true. Many states database give insurance card used even states without database figure out.

Washington state website show vaccination records, including COVID. United States, motor vehicle crashes leading cause death among children. 2018, 636 children 12 years old younger died motor vehicle traffic crashes, 

Are ready stop driving kids, let ride vehicles order keep alive? two times likely die car accidents die covid-19. You‚Äôre virtuous brah tell think would've lot sooner given people back associated public health crisis politicization. Either Clinton Bush would took matter seriously liberals conservatives would compliant mask wearing, vaccination, helping getting thing soon possible.   520 far. numbers currently rising quite dramatically continue schools start again. clearly plenty selfish morons care one single bit. Meh, educate kids world we're setting fire slip door? 

Memorizing American Revolution dates going help siphon gas run mega-bunker's A/C, knowing ""laissez-faire economics"" means make better creating Mad Max armor old shopping carts tires. 

Getting long COVID suffering asthma, however, definitely impact ability escape roving hordes organ-snatchers. Yeah, nobody internet experience food service jobs today. That's unheard of.

Keep mind, many days would able work hospital due getting vaccine?  brought son meet teacher night school, another family saying moved CA like restrictions back home. seriously hate huge sentiment sub reddit.

Like... No. Doctors going help likely survive.

You deny treatment someone overdosed taking drugs. deny someone antibiotics wear condom. can't tell someone treat broken leg climbed tree dare. treat best care can.

I get people angry upset get vaccinated. person made choices. people absolutely believe trackers vaccine, terrified vaccine cause harm way. fully brainwashed news/media/friends/family. Maybe even worried they'll disowned community get vaccine. society problem.

But absolutely CANT deny medical treatment someone stupid... immoral. doctor would get license revoked that's scary thought Underlying issue they're 82.5 years old.   got vaccine back March ask got immunity past 140 days.

I held earphones called pedantic pointing definition word told learn use dictionary. No?  politicization masks last year felt weird kind expected. honestly didn‚Äôt expect politicization vaccinations. Sure, remember fringe left/right anti-vaxers prior years led measles similar small outbreaks, folks would consider luxury anti-vax. COVID clearly took luxury away, yet folks‚Äô numbers exploded. mind boggles. da best

We da best

...We da best ü•≤ Good ole fashioned classical conditioning finest :) mature adult admits mistakes takes responsibility even it‚Äôs brutally hard. LOT immature people running around pretending they‚Äôre grownups. feel getting booster without FDA approval? feel like getting 3rd shot Pfizer cause took muscle relaxer day second shot I‚Äôm worried made less effective.  work movie theater requiring masks, fact kn95s hand people. Business pretty good guests excited get safe time. feels like preview COULD like everyone cooperated. must kids job. kids daycare, 1st grade school program. It‚Äôs way work. lot us work pandemic. Funny people use call us heroes. point immoral: hospital's resources completely overextended.  happens doctors ""triage"": Picking choosing treat likelyhood survival (which means leaving worst chances die).   something like do, choice ICU patient count far exceeds abilities care them.   Good need Polish people anymore American chance get vaccinated. people ruining everyone else.

Look way unvaccinated would die problem would solved. sadly, works. large events coupled large amounts unvaccinated morons causing virus mutate. said possibility new Lambda strain may less ignore vaccination immunity. simple ""don't worry unvaccinated people spreading shit around"". qualify PUA? entertainment workers CA People don‚Äôt want hear message, demonized. tired way people acting. knew people stupid selfish, never realized extent last years.  Probably less crazy purposefully creating misinformation. Surprised record 1450. Well great. I'm east valley well. ""Greatest country Earth"" y‚Äôall. It‚Äôs massive spike. couple hundred cases day delta came along smacked us upside head. heads ‚Äî that‚Äôs city Brentwood California Brentwood neighborhood LA.

Also, believe article said 55 contact tracing. flu kill children Covid year. least, flu &amp; pneumonia. 

Why close schools flu/pneumonia DECADES then? mean, ever open schools first place? flu/pneumonia, communicable diseases. homeschool children entire time? ever expose children anything turned 18? predict mobs fires 3 weeks in. I'm San Antonio. rate stupid governments getting boiling point, opinion. Um already did. many times step up? step mandate vaccines dick. come watch people die yourself. Listen screams children dead. See fear eyes they've bipap 6 days straight intubated, sedated paralyzed. Hold phone 42 year old say goodbye kids 5 9. nightmares PTSD. fuxking problems judge. STEP UP. SOMETHING logic, lack thereof, exactly same.

Deny scientific reality ignore experts suit priors. They're gravely ill one Monday oxygenating poorly I'm positive they'll die  peoplr shrugged Sandy Hook, surprise ""I paid student loans college free"" Still are.my Facebook inundated them. YUP. literally insane. dont know

A) long term effects

B) bad effects kids

C) deadly is

Theres much BS dont know dont care, craziest thing ive ever seen. world many ppl dont want face truth, decisions kill children. Yes, visiting doctor friend week OB. said biggest fear sequence biological events could Covid set off. 50+ years ago, HPV set viruses mostly harmless. know HPV leading cause cervical, throat sexual health cancers. know Covid attacks body 10,20,30+ years? Even mild asymptomatic case. have, either summer school, year round program Agreed. plan both:

""The cruise operator plans require guests crew voyages fully vaccinated require take Covid-19 tests prior embarkation."" someone put perspective? lot? number underreported less COVID testing? could federal government done? vast majority response always going hands states. exact care would give someone else.

Well that's seriously debatable. going go well conspiracy circles. last week still 7 states zero children death. states considered children 0-18yrs old. Total children mortality 358. Theres 500k death since pandemic. There‚Äôs risk ages children still small compared older people. would stop school cases, enforce masks? Like obviously cases, you‚Äôre cavalier, stay open. gave got ""real job"" 10+ years musician, performer, DJ, event worker. I‚Äôm vaccinated .01% chance dying now. wouldn‚Äôt feel safe going clubs music festivals?  r/oneanddone God poor kids. completely fucked abandoned time. People fear ""long covid"" results constantly fucking schooling going pretty severe too. like force people things like car insurance smoke public places, reasonably protect well-being others. Sometimes best option. Yeah, civil war brutal. can‚Äôt believe ‚Äúpatriotic‚Äù Americans fly flag still. think people nostalgic '50s would 100% board science. Back told white suburban America American scientists developed vaccine brave astronauts take get moon they'd queuing round block pretty horrifying. 1344 kids week. Pediatric ICUs something like 8 beds per 100,000 kids.

The [CDC rate per 100,000. Hospitalizations currently 0.24 per 100,000. past waves 1/3 hospitalized adolescents required ICU care, that'd 0.08. Certainly trending wrong direction, there's fairly ample headroom, least nationwide. exactly happened 2.5 year old son well. Daycare opened fall last year amazing progress made.  Wasn‚Äôt people vaccinated? Look getting KN95 KF94 masks. Chinese Korean (respectively) equivalent N95s pretty readily available. around unvaccinated unmasked people, best bet.  say  Pro COVID-19 I'm sure interpreted statement one surprise shock. I'm simply stating months ago none medical experts TV telling us expect 20% cases vaccinated.  No, prepared advocate policies enforce better automobile safety, proper child restraints, seat belts. dig deeper statistic, erroneously used justify stance, you‚Äôll see 1/3 children killed using seat belts restraints. let‚Äôs turn question around. willing support firmer policies ensure children properly restrained thus reducing lives lost significantly? so, directly equivalent also supporting mask social distancing mandates protect children others?

With way, argument facetious comparing ‚Äúapples oranges.‚Äù  Within United States, impossible majority population use modern transportation children. Mask mandates social distancing measures, however, interfere day-to-day requirements modern living. may find inconvenient uncomfortable, that‚Äôs limit it. We‚Äôre #1! We‚Äôre #1! I'm seeing numbers 1 3000 infected children ( including asympto ) develop MIS-C covid.  city due lot vaccinations things still extremely casually locked (Mask, Social Distance, etc). soon opened back point old normal, vaccination rates got stuck, numbers exploded.

Our governor banned cities going back. are. that's true one heck hoax cooked up.

Especialy globaly...they can't agree simplest thi gs conspire together sure... Europe slow Beast move.


But, starts going. goes! response would've even failure. take situation objectively bad.      refuse 12 children! 

Any would irresponsible likely cut ‚Äúme‚Äù time. check health authorities, news since beginning AZ effective delay. recommends 8-12 week I've thinking this, guess new variant forming would worse forming elsewhere since wouldnt get time prepare it. also feel little like scaremongering. There's way piece info actually convinces anyone get vaccinated yet. So.... fired eating meat? 


(Since claim vegan get taking vaccine) old hs classmates quoted shit developed full brain worms election stealing too. really strange experience expect, given signs pointed getting back semblance normalcy. 

Both hospitalizations active cases local counties gone 5 less good number weeks. suddenly active cases surged 20x within seemingly days. also seems stubbornly type preventative measures last year exponentially more-so year lot politicians side. really cannot comprehend people seeing horror stories long term effects still think death death two options. chances life permanently changed closer 5-10% various studies I've seen, even long term effects mild. what? Politics? Anti-vaxxers? what? talking folks shape, passed fitness exams running whole court hoops getting kicked military bullshit bmi tables. hold antibiotic resistant bacteria? Precisely forces work. Overuse antibiotics blamed phenomenon. two ideas seem inextricably linked me. require hospitalization likely suffer brain deficit worse stroke. even need put vent. sick enough need hospital support massively increases risk brain issues. infuriating aspect Biden CDC's handling Delta me. Prior essentially proclaiming ""we've beat COVID"" KNEW even contagious strain COVID existed UK India, still decided unmasking reopening way go. fucked us, we'll continue see results actually something opposed talk it.

The CDC proven absolutely inept despite administration switch, Biden significantly better Trump was, still pretty piss-poor performance recent. COVID flu. [There flu epidemic last year social distancing masking. kicked butts Jeez. die, go straight Heaven, nothing worry about! I'd settle zombie dead still underage kids... That's happen. requires full FDA approval vaccines. IIRC, expected next weeks. 

This also make legal non-governmental businesses mandate employee vaccinations without requiring government mandate - wherever specifically outlawed. Can't live fear tell boss am? thought read recently Lambda vaccine resistant South America one foreign vaccines dominant (China‚Äôs Sinovax, maybe?) good match Pfizer / Moderna vaccines? finally got go bar. got surprise vacation work (someone taking time moved shifts around favor) I'm probably going go one time saying goodbye now. Also probably gonna start masking soon. Funny assume qualify unemployment $SRNE look em  lived Alamance last years thankful moved away. Although people larger towns ok enough mask mandate, ton hostility since dropped. husband still masked shop ate times vaccinated cases started skyrocketing again. One time thought going actually get attacked restaurant wearing masks leaving. 

I also can‚Äôt tell many times overheard someone grocery store proclaim covered blood Christ thus protected Covid also hoax. Like sort Jesus hazmat suit.  least collect unemployment long enough one way ticket country cheap hookers blow. Slow clap. 10-15% covid victims need hospital support. good chunk need breathing support.

A majority people people would dead 1918. anticoagulants, dexamethasone, antibiotics opportunistic infections lungs.

I see anyone estimated this. find article August 2020 based excess deaths alone, even advanced medicine, death rate covid worse spanish flu modern hospital care would far higher. numbers rising ICU's filling up? Everything I've heard herd immunity probably never 70%+ get shot. Im investigative journalist....

but...They posted asking plant ID Mississippi 2 month ago. guy nextdoor put wall studies allegedly masks indicated medical settings Yup data facts. got guy. Like said stop responding now, know need know you. forget tweakers, tend pretty skinny. Like plot pandemic movie borders closed since December first heard Covid China. remain closed everything outside trade  mean, would want person around kids? illogical bs would teach them. 

Pretty sure that‚Äôs guaranteed danger virus point‚Ä¶ haha Great, I‚Äôll happy resign happens. could get lazy asses ask help. another this: PCR = Polymerase Chain Reaction, testing method detect genetic material viruses accurate rate survive organ damage? know 2 middle age people (possibly permanent) heart lung damage unable physical activities many months later. Yes isn‚Äôt point. variant deadly cases case.

More cases = bad outcomes. That‚Äôs point That's stop infection open wounds. think care internet points? could million terms negative still know shit part hive mind. entire controversial section assholes get downvoted go agree assholes. 

Then even still responding guy? much better handle situation terms pros cons. You‚Äôre even teacher. Sit lol Also, people insist flu analogy, year Covid killed 600k Americans, HUNDRED flu cases US. 

Considering everyone flu like symptoms tested Covid, like looking flu reporting either. Solid choice, wish guys best. desperately want answers organ damage. We‚Äôve seen heart, kidney, lung, brain, permanent organ damage resulting COVID (sometimes seemingly different mechanisms). We‚Äôve also seen COVID patients develop long term blood clotting issues.

Is link long COVID organ damage? What‚Äôs prevalence organ damage? It‚Äôs severely understudied, don‚Äôt much way numbers. naive way acting.  hire security staff enforce federal mandate masks transit? Hey look bright side, least they'll (individually) start believing climate change water/fire necks.

While peer group berates *really* _____. ‚ÄúWhat good mandate‚Äù

Wearing masks reducing probability infection. Someone forgetting wear mask half time might reduce infection chance spending hour well air filtered indoor area 60% 50% always masking might 60% 30%. still helps, much less obviously. Numbers post made example purposes. I'm firmly belief look excess death data published government actual covid death toll around 100k higher reported. parents ""figure out"" guess need anymore. Depends place live.  -America fattest first world country world entered chat- know live, rest world sure things. happens room 7609, stays room 7609! benefits school it‚Äôs clear children haven‚Äôt gotten level education would gotten compared person learning. Something like 40% kids LA county didn‚Äôt call zoom meetings all. 

There also mental health problems kids home. kids getting enough eat certain areas? kids experiencing abuse? 

So virus kids almost risk for, you‚Äôll keep entire generation children school second full year? doesn‚Äôt make sense. gonna lose lot generation never recover. 

Hey know fun scoring Internet points (you‚Äôre btw - seem unpopular moment) teacher I‚Äôm amazed can‚Äôt understand stuff. Pretty sad. I‚Äôm moving back north year. I‚Äôm excited safer plus seasons yes lets nothing always works I'm sure point - ok kids get sick work? can't right, I'm hoping clarify. Can't link please? can't find it. woke morning good mood. Turned local news. Big mistake part. 

All hospitals area (low vaccinated area) around full capacity covid patients started turning people away ER visits. 

What going take people get vaccine least bare minimum follow guidelines? know that‚Äôs million dollar question seriously. least bare fucking minimum point. need learn live virus. 

How different we've past year, exactly? wish could move away FL safer. so?  gasps sweet nicotine saturated air. Amen I'm going go ahead disagree here. wife teacher kids, right now, lowest intellectually socially ever seen, ever. taking massive toll. schools even call ""covid dip"" they're recalibrate lessons fact kids literally year behind.  add fact no-one counting days kids deadbeat parents (you want know much is) sent school parents shit home them.

We're going feel effects generations. son 13 months. I‚Äôm terrified something happen him. Everybody around vaccinated chance scary. Yet government wants us trust it

I don‚Äôt get whatever coworker told Friday mentioned worried kids getting sick. Yeah, tell people hospitalized week kid got chicken pox they‚Äôre usually surprised. stuff joke, even kids.  horrible idea , Nurses Doctors run ragged help patients.
If Doctor Nurse walked away profession really really need to. Getting sick make immune, least extent vaccines (but many believe so). 100% guaranteed, neither vaccination. FAR vaccinated break-through infections reinfections recovered individuals.

Frankly, media authorities mostly silent natural immunity likely diminished trust them. Im saying grown ass adults put much stock con man. Especially one proven liar many times over. thoughts kids going back person school? child start years, lot friends whose kids starting school soon Texas allow mask mandates. unvaxxed risk household members, could give less care personally. read plot summary depressed. Yes! us provide informed consent, let us vaccinate kids! Good guys. shame country makes us choose health knowledge, I'm happy guys trying best him. whole family got RSV Florida.
It incredibly horrible, asthma could barely breathe. different cold flu I've ever before. able PCR confirm infection.

You want another virus would unbelievably horrible. that: Kids proud die keep economy running. general public read details - that's simple, clear messaging needed. Say ""vaccinated individuals much lower risk, still contract spread virus.""  ask, don‚Äôt tell you.  show examples unions rejecting better contracts negotiated idea? How?  biased towards work, build models things (not fun things, financial things), think lot comes back logical reasoning. Like LSAT way. People really bad it. coworkers, clients, people interact with. People don‚Äôt get it. people can‚Äôt think terms models. 

This reason pyramid schemes. one person invents new pyramid scheme recruits 3 new friends, day person recruit recruits 2 people 3x many people pyramid day before, day 17-18 thing bigger whole population United States. 

This exact math R0. person gets sick, many people person infect. Delta R0 3.5-4.0 unmasked unvaccinated population . That‚Äôs close pyramid scheme example above. wouldn‚Äôt surprised it‚Äôs people fall pyramid schemes repeatedly predominantly antivaxx anti mask groups. 

Thankfully states amount vaccinated people (not lower 35% adults). start see states serious outbreaks Delta. preventative measures means thing rip populations quickly. anyone starts think least we‚Äôll herd immunity, won‚Äôt.

There‚Äôs computer chip shortage due drought area they‚Äôre produced (or they‚Äôre bought governments put vaccine /s). everything blamed government‚Äôs mishandling virus, also need blame government‚Äôs mishandling climate crisis. 10 billion go!!

Remember population 7 billion vaccines 2 dose nearly 14 billion doses needed vaccinate everyone. thats problem unvacinated dont health issues dont care anybody else suspect many parents used spending much time children pre-covid, perhaps they've fill want go back care much      must people insist worst bit humanity? new bucket challenge missed? That's always bugs new articles open ""the EU botched vaccine roll-out"". didn't. vaccine, nothing roll out. infrastructure there, ready go. Pascal Soriot turned said: ""Vaccine, vaccine?

I've getting downvoted yelled entire pandemic saying kids schools bad idea. like literally every one forget bad diseases spread schools every winter... I'm similar situation. School starts tomorrow us. We're Florida 11 year old 8 year old. husband teaches middle school, I'm returning teaching preschool. We're vaccinated get, getting best masks can. kids' mental health deteriorated severely last fall tried distance learning, still ""virtual"" therapy recover. feels absolutely awful. Masks inconvenient comfortable bare faces, we've got left. stupid governor passed idiotic ruling public schools cannot require masks. sure. crazy much worse become. think Delta Variant burn months. feels like last summer again, good way. second fittest state country, Colorado.

Things okay! lot hospitalizations unvaccinated 20-40 year olds, school age fully vaccinated people elderly. know tons articles right insinuating children dropping like flies, data suggests bad they're making out.

I mean sound flippant like I'm minimizing valid worries. Covid still serious genuine threat areas low vaccine uptake. see lot people US really panicking schools, kids, etc., wanted provide perspective country that's already wave seen turn right unvaccinated children fully vaccinated people.  thing is, vaccine effect wears time like falling cliff. Gradually, people get infected (probably little symptoms) antibody level high enough offer protection (and cycle repeats). Nothing ‚Äúguilty‚Äù about, they‚Äôve always said vaccine way way normalcy done anything less live normally fully vaccinated? family got norovirus daycare earlier year. can't clean enough far I'm concerned. Exactly this. problem parents juat bad situation, boss 11 year old daughter starts school soon. birthday October can't homeschool anymore effective.

They're holding breath telling never take mask. think reason Delta affects kids lockdown reduced immune systems ? Apparently things like RSV severe children due underdeveloped immune systems, wonder Delta could way. weak fear virtual teaching

I understood time year ago, suppression made sense vaccines available. understand need vaccinate far people throwing borders open.

Now I've vaccinated months though, idea NZ going permanently change border controls like Ardern suggesting seems like massive overkill. world going moved come terms whilst kiwis accept long term isolation. *AntiVa*

Damn, that‚Äôs good! properly

probably likely exposed virus individually. bullshit! Vegan here, partner, got shots soon could get appointments. Yeah interestingly, initially hearing thought people thus protests happening... looked found regular media bullshit reports focusing vocal minority (protesters) fools planning go cruise November? bought tickets dirt cheap beginning year figuring vaccines would put things relatively back normal, never imagined variants huge anti-vax sentiment would cause much trouble.  clearly know nothing :) enjoyed skipped academic challenges.

Herd immunity correct term something like -- immune system builds efficiently destroy virus time. body prepared fight it, detect virus faster address spreads (moderate vs mild). apt say rolling ""immunity"" within daycares children less susceptible it, worse cases. lockdown babies, much exposure illnesses due preventative measures caused rates common viruses lower last year (RSV virus solely effects children. immune systems underdeveloped strong response virus. ie. COVID, viral load someone vaccinated infected substantially lower someone unvaccinated infected.

Yes, that's true. However, couple counter-points:

1. already vaccinated per previous comment assume end long covid. vaccinated mean can't contract covid, means still risking ending long covid. basically, yes already risked long-covid symptoms vaccinated, taking additional risks long covid top that.
2. certainty moment, appears risk long covid vaccine lower risk ending contracting covid.

In addition, think myself. vaccinated, know still spread virus could lead someone around contracting person could end long covid issues something even worse.

That's personally go huge event. There's potential consequences beyond could happen choose go. think able go clubs, festivals, large events huge price pay helping stop spread virus. populace Wouldn‚Äôt YTY better measure peak now? people avoiding crowds. Masks optional people still wear shops public transport, almost one wears outside. 

Office work still near old normal, office set capacity 40% normal actually 20% attend day days like 10%. 

I'd say still quiet caution almost general population little fear. Many people worried self isolate cancel plans lose money getting virus, especially double vaccinated. Honestly it‚Äôs weird place minority people. live Denver it‚Äôs rare see masks anywhere clubs packed full people.

Let's start age range (in we're seeing). 
-Kids refers young children 12 WELL young adults 30 under.
-The average age children hospitalized covid 12 years age compared month ago 16 years age.

I want provide perspective that's heard (right least). work adult ICU last 10 years.
-Our last really big surge last winter average age closer 60. fact, rather rare someone ICU covid 50 years younger.
-The last four months taken care younger younger people. may due fact look age demographics vaccination rates, 50-64 59% 65+ 75%.
-In adult ICU, seeing people 20's end ventilators. last time abnormal (related infectious disease) rise polio 1930's.
-We seeing healthy, pregnant mothers 20's emergent c-section health baby. mother's end adult ICU ventilators. New father's children lost wife mother covid.
-While pediatric neonatal ICUs incredible nurses doctors, never experienced anything like this. would gladly cross trained pediatrics neonatal ICUs covid surge, however, drug dosing, labs, even assessments vary greatly compared adult population. even event covid isolated children 12 years younger able supplement staffing adult ICU nurses, skill sets vary enough would able primary nurses (those overseeing cares, labs, etc.) making sure things get missed.

Who get vaccinated right now?
-Anyone 12 years age older (at least US).
-If new trend indication anything, vaccines work incredibly well prevented lot deaths hospitalizations 50+ populations. indication would hold true younger 50 children.

Kids seen grandparents (fully vaccinated) since 2019, would like go spend week house, concerned travel into/out Florida.

FL hot spot Delta variant, risks airport? Kids mostly good wearing masks, little one slips every then. Could largely maintain social distance, except security bathrooms.

Other option drive, 20+ hours, means multiple stops bathroom breaks... would less risk?

Other parents, would travel FL right now? Despite fact like 2/3rd americans compounding factors make susceptible covid hopefully avoidable high vaccination rates. numbers Aussie modeling show ICU capacity likely overwhelmed, forcing govt mask mandates social distancing, even 80% vaccination. 

As teacher also want see border loosened students vaccinated well. vaccine perfect want surrounded unvaccinated group close quarters day. 

Right Delta burning way unvaccinated populations developed countries. another year much better chance herd immunity reached far fewer cases developed countries, much less risk opening borders them. 

I expect eventually stop light system green, amber red zone countries combined rapid airport testing vaccine passports allow much open border. also bet happening another year. Correct. goes viruses like EBV. don‚Äôt know stating simple fact causes many downvotes sub.  reassurance, vitro experiments often equal real life transmission, many drugs seem promising lab level cell even animal tests, fail human testing. 

Also, diseases survivable benefit virus itself, deadlier transmissible virus less likely media likes say views lol. diseases either less deadly transmissible, less transmissible deadly. Part covid bad ""sweet spot"" transmissibility deadliness. Delta transmissible higher viral load, deadlier alpha, think vaccine enough offset delta variants. 

This time last year, hoping vaccines least 60-75% effective, heard 95% effective, got spoiled lol. variants, vaccines seem around 60-75% effectiveness honestly pretty good. I'm trying part, wear mask, avoid large crowds possible, that's keeping sane. thinking Dollar Tree, Dollar General (which sells stuff upwards $30). shouldn't, lot people latched onto idea should. understand frustration, attitude isn‚Äôt going convince anyone get vaccinated. think shaming harm good point. hear people still worried droplets addressing aerosol feel obligated mention latter point well researched piece.

Because you‚Äôre misunderstanding takeaway. 

Despite possibility aerosols which, non-medical-professionals won‚Äôt encounter, masks still better option trying force businesses increase ventilation. 

I‚Äôm sure else tell here. I‚Äôm virologist public health degree. hear you. pulled daughter last year took loss requiring masks Preschool, Elementary school. congenital condition increases risk complications respiratory illness. actually continuous oxygen first year life get Synagis (RSV monoclonal antibodies) injections monthly prevent RSV high-risk. She‚Äôs better now, oxygen 2 years, we‚Äôre still cautious. find school isn‚Äôt ‚Äúwalking walk‚Äù practices masks, won‚Äôt hesitate, I‚Äôll pull again. Yet another example reading full article necessary. AFT President Randi Weingarten personally backs it, union yet vote if. Could hurt economy even tiny little bit? we're it. Seems like one ignorant South Korea, everyone masked first week February 2020. end March flu disappeared. Family doctors seeing literally zero cases. clear masks (kf80/94) work incredibly well, covid nasty contagious. needs scientists boomer uncle FB? I‚Äôm religious feel need say, bless kind stranger. Thank you‚Äôre doing. Thank much must dealing with. we‚Äôre patients, sometimes don‚Äôt show appreciation enough. promise do. kiwi mate mine taught term Kia Kaha (I‚Äôve never seen spelt I‚Äôm probably wrong) means ‚ÄúStand strong‚Äù. I‚Äôd say sometimes things got tough. honestly gave resilience tougher days. Kia Kaha Song. Exactly. saying big deal refusing anything it. Sitting hands thumbs ass might advantage. People see things free think ‚Äúbah, wants that?‚Äù People see things dollar think ‚Äúwhat bargain!‚Äù Ive seen garage sales. Point taken, sure lack education common denominator. We're #1! 19% cases since July California vaccinated people. question looking genuine answer, accepted nearly thousand children dying every year RSV influenza. assume something people well since protests street corners 2019 shut everything Covid deaths among children since beginning pandemic bit UK, (granted less sophisticated vaccine), even recommend vaccinating healthy clear risk blood clots outweighs chance dying virus. think part reason hard honestly pretty easy past 30 years people that‚Äôs relate to. Think back past people do. Even today people world don‚Äôt access child care like developed countries do. Sadly whole situation really exposing unsustainable routines are. Next sick sad world Individualism great, point. But, part individual freedom needs ability discern information make good decisions. really want place blame, public education system's failings (couple parent's lack interest raising children - really long topic boil single line, I'm aware) gotten us point. like pro-birth. ‚ÄúWeeks‚Äù? vaccine close approval pediatrics?  true. 50% entire population vaccinated US, includes 16s able vaccinated yet. didn‚Äôt say didn‚Äôt? Idk you‚Äôre implying did. feel like people caught culture war aren‚Äôt page stop spread. hear people still worried droplets addressing aerosol feel obligated mention latter point well researched piece. received treatment doctors say three months. Seemed long time wait get vaccine. Thanks link! DeSantis needs removed, also needs held responsible death injury occurs due horrible mismanagement covid 100% pro mask frustrated anti-maskers. 

BUT, think important try keep good perspective anti-mask folks different views own. responding *perceive* issues fairness truth... even perceptions seem ridiculously flawed us. 

Talking **to** evil idiots productive. (Although talking **about** way behind backs certainly fun help blow steam!)

Sorry got downvoted trying inject perspective. gave upvote. much I‚Äôm required unfortunately work Keep telling that, keep telling individual problem. Herd immunity collective issue. individuals solve it. Buracratic paperwork kills children. time following standard protocols right. thanks joe YEAH WE'RE NUMBER 1 WE'RE NUMBER--oh shit read whole title definitely wage crisis rather labor one. I've looking move jobs watching current job desperately trying hire, wages still hired 4 years ago. would anyone choose work high stress job office, bad hours $18/hr that's less make waiting tables whatever.

If paying rent bills probably take online courses something wages go level worth it. Jesus :( Ask Fox News! Yay we‚Äôre back minimum wage pre-covid relative inflation!!! guys!!! affect kids greater numbers? know hear children's hospitals crowded look CDC data really see clearly stated kids getting sicker. I'm trolling can't find good stats that. kid want know. Anybody numbers? agree more.  all. 


Mississippi doesn‚Äôt allow religious exemptions vaccines. Hence vaccinated get schools. 



A states also require vaccinations exemptions. state south policy. 


Donald Trump said vaccines cause autism 2016 presidential debate. 


While anti-vax shit liberal conservative circles. Republican Party actually taken governmental steps anti-vax long covid. 


When California wanted remove religious exemptions Republicans it. 



Anti-Vax really never liberal conservative thing believe conspiracy theories.




Donald Trump brings bullshit conspiracies time like Obama born Kenya. 



The people believe dumb shit also anti-vax. Conspiracy theory type people become mainstream Republican Party ever since tea-party came full fruition Yes I'm public indoors. I'm home family/friends know vaccinated no. Possibly, leave wave death disability wake. call progress. end goal? No. better was? Yes. Let's happy progress happens keep pushing better. okay happy good things happen.  source claims please ? Anecdotal ( unvaccinated ) daughter brought home mostly asymptomatic case covid church camp two Wednesdays ago realize Saturday got tested due many kids coming trip. None vaccinated people house caught ( oddly enough 1 Pfizer, 1 J&amp;J, 1 Moderna ) spite fairly close contact days ( including riding vehicles ).

Vaccines FTW! sure, can‚Äôt argue all. difficultly keeping everyone safe increased. hope least 12+ vaccinated masked normal year possible. It‚Äôs terrible, risk catching Covid 5x higher unvaccinated. puts efficacy around 83%.

This isn‚Äôt far trials, 90-95% 65 age group. It‚Äôs clear vaccine efficacy decreases significantly age. vaccine efficacy also 5% lower current environment compared trial placebo group immunity natural
Infection unvaccinated population.

The best way move on, people benefit vaccination (&lt;40) get soon possible reduce spread. Pro-forced birth. Still 4 bill lot already know joke, it‚Äôs terrible idea increase politicisation pandemic. daily vaccination take rate U.S. \~39% last 30 days.  Taking supporters doesn‚Äôt seem like prudent idea want continue political career.

But maybe that‚Äôs me. !emojify problem binary thinking.

Light, dark. Hot, cold. Good, bad. Works, work. 

I pet lizard number years whose brain worked way. Oregon resident here, glad mask mandate. still decided sending 6yo 10yo back person next month. wife vaccinated months still terrified. can't believe back shit again. Fucking America.... 60k *estimated* number flu cases Covid numbers time confirmed cases. even meaningful comparison. districts around not. huge voice union lunches eaten home rooms rather cafe, union voted teacher‚Äôs manidtory prep lunch. Covid disgusting show individualism. That's now, asked compared what? History full things far worse this, people still children. Plague, world wars, famine. live greatest times, almost children survive adults. wasnt always case, people still children. Even agree guy (who claims Canadian public agree this) broader topic (allowing travel groups fully vaccinated people), consider downvote spamming he's actually citing claims.

It's like Japanese civilians actually wanting Olympics, sloppy journalism saying ""Japan looks forward Olympics.""

Journalism shitty enough, right critical sloppy reporting. think people infected percentage, appears kids since vaccinated folks impacted much there's fewer older people. 

i'm sure numbers wrong, lets say last surge one person age impacted covid given town, 1-100, 100 cases easy peasy. vaccinations there's people aged 1-50 impacted, sudden number kids impacted went 18% 36%  Yeah put 6mon May ridiculous. Kid gets (negative) c19 test every couple weeks. Vaccines already mandated diseases/viruses American thing, side effect reality internet made ""science believer"" statement identity virtue rather habit thinking, analyzing evidence, willing change mind evidence support rather giving confirmation bias looking individuals evidence agrees pre-conceived views. say same. also POTS wish anyone. (I vaccinated yet (I be) I'm scared vaccine aggravate POTS symptoms based fact vaccines do..I'm nurse must get yearly vaxx. Im ok within weeks flares suck). 

Anyway I'm going course yes sucks, long haul symptoms much worse anything vaxx bring. Get vaccinated. current vaccines work well variants make improved version them. According CDC, pneumonia caused larger number deaths COVID-19 people age 0-29 past year. entire pandemic blown proportion since lol Worldometers wildly outdated weekends accurate states reporting 100% cases two weeks ago. states lowest rise cases Missouri (+18%), Nevada (+21%), Arkansas (+24%). Every state +53% last 14 days. You‚Äôll get everyone sick stay work, need leave right away tell work sick we‚Äôre exposed. office colleagues need get tested days sooner start symptoms. LMAO ya, THAT'S kids. makes sense Roger that! fact even considering going meeting knowing exposed COVID don‚Äôt feel well part reason mess right now.

How even question?  wish. insurance cover OCD specific therapy, general therapy often help. I've seen 10 therapists life weirdest responses anxiety disorders. ""Do believe god?"" ""You try yoga!"", etc. depends definition meaningful

CDC reporting 349 children died covid, that's leukemia causes year. 

you said want anecdotes, TMC houston recently reported full pediatric ICU means kids could get ICU non covid reasons. likely die result hospital chain others, part hard quantify Exactly. never tell kids put nose pull talking (how STILL adults that?!) Absolutely hilarious people disseminate article, found fake.

You're problem. Wtf teach? Pretentiousness 101? asking. It‚Äôs time start mandating. vaccinated leave people hell alone. 

If governments find person legitimately vaccine medical reasons person take precautions accordingly world moves on. 

I‚Äôm tired asking stupid I‚Äôm tired accommodating special cases. 

I don‚Äôt think lot polarized people realize moderate folks complied far vaxxed getting pretty tired anti vax nutters nanny state ‚Äúthink children‚Äù groups. Yeah, stated maintain social distance airport, plane. Counting airplane HEPA filter data indicating low risk transmission flight. 400 kids die first year covid....(w/ lockdowns, masks, restrictions...) w/ delta, Indonesia 100 kids 12 die week entire month july...

Delta getting started takes months deaths kick in. (weeks incubating, feeling sick, hospital, ventilator/icu... die) Looks like add P.3 list upstart lineages outcompeted delta. understand wife's concerns, I'm hard time understanding concerns parents. Yes, small risk severe breakthrough case, also lots risks children carry around every single day nothing COVID *way* riskier elderly caretakers (a severe pneumonia case flu, example). Chills reading this. 

Prayers children parents‚Ä¶and prayers medical team - strength focus. listen NPR every day never heard say that. said, past 3 months I‚Äôve heard lot NPR reports doctors saying herd immunity fucked vaccine hesitation. One less kid distract parent min wage service job pretend educate. fully vaccinated American present substantive danger Canadians. Kills? No.

Hospitalized? percent hospitalized/infected kids get long covid? Dont know (but I'd guess better adults)

In non-medical opinion, bigger problem that, parts US, ICU ER immense pressure COVID. cascading effect patients ailments. think read first year daycare kids typically sick 36 weeks year.

Also ready get sick get too.  WHOOOO, BREAKING WORLD RECORDS, CUZ WE'RE GREATEST! RIGHT GUYS!?

*looks around sees no-one*

G-guys? American Acadamey Pediatrics says already enough data.

Soyrs, nonsense nonsense.

Time let kids doctors doctors. Maybe they‚Äôre referring Oxford-AstraZeneca one (honestly don‚Äôt know)? means police, firefighters, public roads schools Or...and stick here...we know antibodies wane many healthy people fine people immune compromised would greatly benefit third dose. Big sign highway way work morning - 97% hospitalized COVID patients unvaccinated state.  


That 3% matters. 


Just there's incentive party act certain way mean entire situation utterly corrupt. Hard find anything concrete see lot countries use Sinovac becoming concerned delta. Sinovac announced testing delta specific booster Aug 7th. Sinovac also released information today 3rd shot original formula effective older patients given 8 months initial dosing.

A Sri Lankan university study says Sinopharm shows good delta efficacy study released last week. can't speak accuracy that. Sinopharm also working delta-specific vaccine well. parent largely maintain social distance, except security bathrooms.

This seems incredibly optimistic. There's entire flight, getting plane, etc. several hours without distancing.

I would think 5-10 minutes into/out public restrooms (which may may require masks) would less risky several hours without distancing couple hundred people, I'm expert take grain salt.

If set flight, I'd recommend N95s find (they local hardware store, example). give wearer protection (you could also put cloth medical masks top get couple uses - remember something last year again, take word 100% that). country care single people either. Families get infinitely support individuals. Even though support families ass. fact matter hospitals still get full. saying let get full? hard add beds hospitals; hard part finding specialized staff (regular RNs, ER RN's, ICU RNs), ventilators medical equipment. latter takes years effort get done, we're seriously trying pandemic hit. enough staff take care patients worst comes worst. Hospitals full means would prevented accessing otherwise basic healthcare (e.g. elective procedures). everything minimize hospital load including enforcing heavy restrictions, if/when get point again. know ""you heard"" something think makes informed ever actually looked everything yourself? Done research?

COVID-19 deaths dramatically reported. disseminator lies misinformation.

Compare historical flu deaths year 2020. Notice anything? COVID-19 tests 2020 found extremely unreliable positive result obtained test could differentiate several common viruses COVID-19, CDC info. Every person died nation 2020 received test regardless actually caused death, tested positive, reported COVID-19 death.

Please tell blinded friends capable least seeing issues recognizing data skewed, drastically reported. Germans always know do. U.K. anti lockdown protestors London, though, reason super loud social media. Twitter Facebook accounts govt members bombarded anti vax, anti vaccine passport anti lockdown comments polls keep showing majority approve. kids complain way less adults know wearing masks. may another new infection

Would like continuation original infection, somehow picked COVID August 4 yesterday?

If relevant, test today self-administered rapid antigen, positive result showed faint line (rather thick/solid line symptomatic last week). F takes time gain full picture data. already know children died covid variants delta variant. clearly smaller numbers. need look data understand it‚Äôs kids completely healthy. health issues contributed? provide accurate picture. already know kids starting get hospitalized delta variant that‚Äôs pretty serious.

This would make sense death numbers high (or even statistically significant). Since they're not, question whether children died health issues contributed death interesting one, hardly deaths aren‚Äôt thing. don‚Äôt know kids hospitalized serious long lasting issues. 


The logical terminus position either: (1) zero COVID, (2) permanent masking. Since (1) seems almost impossible point, I'm left conclude okay (2)? kind day care though. OP point though, vaccinated people still get infected playground virus evolution albeit lower frequency, could formulated argument better.

The communication authorities including Fauci rigorous creates distrust. wear masks - wear masks. Vaxxed remove masks - oh wait spread. Wtf. known beginning vaccine sterilizing ever allow masks indoors?! Anyways, get people get vaccinated arguments. fair, probably arguments would work, vaccines mandatory. public health situation demands decisive actions. Meanwhile, dumbass town trying organize ‚Äúno mask mandate‚Äù ‚Äúthe parents decision‚Äú.
Because 18 months this, people still don‚Äôt understand works. give second? vaccinate everybody? thing making first-class second-class citizens worrying me. real emergency COVID is, let governments fuck around (and governments historically appreciate emergencies). unvaccinated people problem, mandate vaccines period. done previous epidemics even dangerous one, age ranges (as measles/polio kids).

If vaccine mandatory want preserve ""freedom"", get USA model possibly without extremely bad stuff. can't find record primary source actually saying this. [Here transcript quoted evidence claim within article. muh freedom went explain meant. (Most experts agree degree protecting spread well worth trivial effort). 

My point ""masks work"" ""masks work"" counterproductive discussions shut conversation. fact post responded trying cut discussion particular limitation cloth masks (they stop aerosols). perfect, degree wearer protection larger degree source control afforded. Jesus (heyZeus) sacrificed ""boarder"" make happen.  /S USA! USA! USA! Back March alpha dominate hospitalized delta. 

Mental health won‚Äôt matter much kid dies long term health complications ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 3 kids one vaccinated. They‚Äôre staying home year. know essentially nothing vaccines, immunology viruses thought floating around brain pan.  spread especially one dose. right thing push meeting virtual risk exposing colleagues. fun spreading zero symptoms. fully vaccinated, even there's chance spread it. go toy meeting. fact leave work, let work know what's going on. Idk century pandemic happening maybe? ü§î Well that's true. already posted ). Reposts removed. Yes. whole family vaxxed except little one. us wear masks. Kids don‚Äôt go stores all, shop odd hours fewer people. Northern state town 31% vax rate 20% population already contracted covid. must remain parent's choice decide children receive COVID-19 vaccine, rather overreaching mandates schools,"" Van Duyne said statement. ""I introducing bill discourage vaccine distribution, put check federally funded institutions forcing minors vaccinated participate education.""

While there's zero chance bill leave rectal cavity see light day, cult already option get voucher home-school kids? question; current vaccines get FDA approval, likely boosters need FDA re-approval well? know many companies waiting till full approval mandating vaccine, hope get cycle ""Virus Vaccine Companies waiting approval mandate Variant forms unvaxxed Booster Vaccine Companies wait booster approval mandate New varient forms unvaxxed""  First, extra facilities help extra docs/nurses use them.

Second, going pay airlifts costs roughly $1k/min? (recent John Oliver's show literally showed issues ambulance services someone literally foot stuck subway begging people call ambulance since he/she can't pay)

Abbot want convey seriousness issues would make look bad. Skip meeting, wait days, get tested, hoe66. pretty simple. Looking outcomes data young children comparing common illnesses, see small risk outweigh costs delayed education socialization. hospitalization rate covid probably different Delta age group, kids still low levels poor outcomes. Ideal compared exactly? site full people accuse us skeptical mask mandates schools ""killing children."" that's fearmongering, idk is. Thanks, really appreciate kind words! hundreds respiratory illnesses humans time world? Lungs seem like perfect place pathogens like fungi develop. amazing still exist. Everyone concerned whether vaccines protect Delta Lambda variants coronavirus. know RNA sequence. original variant RNA sequence back Jan 2020, Moderna able generate vaccine testing within couple weeks. know platform safe mRNA vaccines work, move forward mRNA vaccines Delta Lambda variants, give people cocktail vaccine covers major variants? randomized controlled trial flu vaccine new strain every year.

Meanwhile China tested 11.3m ppl city positive cases. 

The virus also around since end October, months identified China. already posted Yes, honey, lost you.  know history. 

When people tell going on, argue instead listen learn Yea actually lot fun. 7 months really reinvigorated excitement life. hard daunting sometimes, also pretty fucking cool. It‚Äôs shame need late game COVID. literally got 2nd shot, wish folk wouldn‚Äôt stop acting like know everything safe stuff. doctor mentioned flu shots told remember hearing flu cases way since started wearing mask, agreed gave info all.

Personally wear mask 2 layers high quality cotton filter insert rated 95. Protecting others important protecting family too. like said - time dumbshit mandates cancellations. hospital two half weeks last year (pre-vaccine, obviously), grateful partner allowed visit me. hospital sensible COVID protocols place (including bifurcating staff people worked COVID wards people went nowhere near COVID wards; can't even imagine staffing issues must caused) neither us got it. really, really scary, though.

I hope things looking family.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* incredibly poorly researched full ad hominem course, looking statistics, flat-out false. According CDC, mid-July 2021 339 million vaccine doses given 187 million people **only three deaths linked vaccine.** data many people die year flu vaccine specifically woefully underreported. number people infected year flu, died, survived available everywhere, much compared die vaccine itself. recent data could find 2011. searching year 2011 **CDC Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System website found 51 deaths caused flu vaccines.** means numbers show flu vaccine dangerous 10-fold. 

This terrible research. look VAERS system Covid vaccine find reports around 6000 deaths. course number three truly linked vaccine correct, can't turn around count flu vaccine reports VAERS compare verified number Covid vaccine deaths. reads like college student writing essay something really understand source googling bit.

It would great reddit comment, terrible news article. They're self-reliant hard asses tough nails can't catch breath anymore. source 1,000 children dying every year RSV UK ?

Assuming typo there, think anyone suggesting sort Covid link. comes year lower infections, due various restrictions place reduce spread Covid. Experts fear means many children developed immunity, leading higher number cases year. children, illnesses serious rest plenty fluids. Anecdotal evidence evidence. Two examples Ask teacher.

ü§î I'm confused, chart shows 655,000 deaths, U.S./Confederate. fall/winter saw maybe 12 flu patients ER.  normal 6-10 day peak flu. Hell yeah work. thats life. People's big argument tested years years like products. fail realize is:

\- already technology place

\- working vaccinates coronavirus prior COVID pandemic. COVID19 one form general group viruses, coronaviruses. we're dealing novel strain, we're dealing something that's entirely brand new.

\- Many studies halted time, resources put toward study.

\- studies need specific participants enrollment. example, want study CF drug, need find willing participants Cystic Fibrosis, likely certain type, certain age. COVID, needed anyone 18, period. Volunteers plentiful, unlike many trials.

\- MONEY. Money moves things quickly huge influx allowed resources get job done faster. 

\- vaccines got priority review. Even submit clinical trial results, they're pile lots trials. wait. case COVID vaccines bumped top lots eyes them.

&amp;#x200B;

All stuff holds normal trials. they're necessarily research testing better, there's lot red tape. Appreciate answer! always known, there's plenty Texas Austin math good, newer numbers. 40% Austin area. 200 covid patients ICU 

So covid, we'd around 300 use pre-covid ~400 standard. point, I‚Äôm expecting ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù somewhere middle. Governments likely won‚Äôt implement much going forward beyond mask mandate. Vaccinated people find balance living lives avoiding Covid.

2022 probably won‚Äôt look like 2019 won‚Äôt anywhere near bad second half 2020 either. India I‚Äôm gonna take wild guess assume you‚Äôre anti vax, anti mask anti lockdown well?But, disagree greatest time ever child  Reread wrote. expanded beyond Florida 90's. South East now. trying diminish importance message, name hilarious. many stories insufficient ICU beds fucking fat people.

Or children dying fat people's unhealthy decisions.

What bunch bull-fucking-shit. No. [This good job comparing long certain types mask masks protect you.

The protection times pre-Delta give idea expect.

Hint: N95 friend.

There links factsheet data. Also someone currently experiencing case Covid also making antibodies (just late stop infection). cashiers /s ran President, tried say nothing model Obamacare Everithing tested animal even fake meat vegan food Anecdotal evidence evidence. Two examples lol. 

Ask teacher... schools germ factories normal years. Every year tons kids get flu colds (which caused rhinovirus mild forms human coronavirus). would one respiratory virus kids get? 

Actually theory heard kids get sick often, much frequently adults, means likely antibodies coronavirus infected strains cause colds. know immunity short-lived, roughly year (give take). situation children getting sick ALWAYS going happen. Wow, change habits age keep inflammations down. also dealing all, day day. Terrible. Anyone said virus going go away clearly either insane delusionally optimistic. seldom see diseases eradicated existence, exception smallpox even took decades insane global vaccination effort wipe out. matters vaccine manufacturers ahead curve updating vaccines remain efficable. going become like flu shot, annual/bi-annual experience people, like many anticipated. think mostly correct, want N95 protecting unmasked people. Surgical cloth masks protect wearer certain extent, time distance probably important sure accurate source is, seems  He's two months now. cold atm. :/ make good point. One thing learned anti-vax family past year them, sight mind. cannot comprehend abstract concepts. cannot see/invision descriptions people dying, cannot invision hospital. far away concept. happen, don‚Äôt think would change vaccination rates. think would screw hospitals would need treat people free weeks weeks. completely right. misread antigen test (the rapid test), would make sense opinion screening infection + vaccine certification good combo cruise safety next bullet point anti-vaxxers' conspiracy list almost writing itself. well yeah, one reasons wear surgical mask actively spraying mouth nasal fluids open wounds. pandemic made jaded people... Depends place. Outside? No. Weekly visits best friend's family? No. Grocery store? Usually. Getting haircut? wear mask get permission take off. 

After becoming fully vaccinated, bother long while. Delta variant breakthrough infections frequent, point could still contagious. So, gotta part. Missouri's bad enough state is. went jabs #1 #2, wait gush happy grateful possible. wanted techs nurses feel appreciated. Yeah unfortunately surprised. Functionally, daycare, every practical way matters. Hugs too! suck  look endemic coronaviruses.

Yeah, endemic coronaviruses vaccines mutates readily 

It mutates lot less everyone vaccinated (for multiple vaccines last long time.

I think opposite actually true. vaccines provide immunity good long there's breakthrough, going going long time.

A scientific breakthrough? No, that's need. breakthrough vaccinated.

If 95%+ population vaccinated, Delta even matter grand scheme things. Hospitals would carrying like normal even us about.

COVID stay misinformation lack political (for better worse) eliminate/eradicate it. ""Kids get infected""
""If get infected, fine""
""If fine, like flu""
""If hospitalized, die""
""If die, they're fat many medical conditions, virus fault""

They give fuck Texas. hence said lot money. Why? lot money. Got it? money also home rent since can‚Äôt buy market health insurance. fair amount savings would wiped kid arrives don‚Äôt work worries. impressive amount people think calling vocal minority downplaying size it. pro vaccine I'm glad still many people getting vaccinated. They're dying larger numbers. They've extremely low mortality throughout pandemic staying way accounts. May ask skepticism behind mask mandates schools? It‚Äôs literally bare minimum request hundreds, probably even thousands experts field agree help reduce spread. may 100% helps reduce it. 

Take vaccines this. Take ‚Äúkilling children‚Äù comments others this. Take politics it. 

Why skepticism? I‚Äôm really trying understand opposing view this. 50/50 that. outside option distance 6' others. probably still sell plenty tickets folks care. admitted 3 days gallbladder removal surgery scheduled back 2019 going ER. gave reason. literally sat room 3 nights waiting. meds, monitoring (except 2x/day BP/fever check). odd looking back 100% need there. Obviously it‚Äôs now, apparently happens even best times! Oh it‚Äôs terrible. I‚Äôm 16 hour days planning period. it‚Äôs safer. shows like COPS Live PD people getting vaccinated background? 
Those shows essentially free advertising Dollar General. huge amount encounters arrests made big yellow sign clearly visible somewhere shot. FYI something good making money mutually exclusive Life scary. many kids polio kill? People kept children. People used account infant mortality by, get this, overproduction. 

I stand said, far times go. never better time child Right Now, pity convinced otherwise. Children kind whole point this, objectively speaking, joys missed partaking many. But, suppose. lol expect free? pay employees? (minority) real born Vegans use tactic avoid vaccine, expect stop taking virtually medications, tested, point, animals. pet peeve articles masks specific kind mask talking about.

There's enormous difference cloth masks, surgical masks N95's. Nope we‚Äôre not. It‚Äôs educational institution learning. you‚Äôre using daycare you‚Äôre failure parent.  neighbor 70s, got Covid early (spring 2020), hospitalized briefly. she‚Äôs always sick. Influenza knocked six weeks. Shingles took 8 weeks recover from. She‚Äôs suddenly suffering odd allergies. used live pool summer‚Ä¶this year took dip pool ended ER developed chlorine allergy. Six different hospital stays past year, five transport ambulance. Gyms mask fucking worst. Especially adults spaces, reason - everyone able get vaccine months. I‚Äôm 2 work studios still mask-optional ones I‚Äôve going to. must live town, agree 100%! wear mask, gotten vax‚Äôd social distance things Im supposed do, minority community. Delta surging, one cares, one cares many died. kids school last year, going yo send year ‚Äústarts Friday‚Äù dont think Im now. cannot risk it, currently youngest one hell cold, rsv virus. little one coughing bad sounded like whooping cough! local hospitals full, Friday 30 odd kids admitted, 3 ICU. suspect numbers climb school starts! state mandated mask, sad thing large group people calling school board meeting try get overturned, dont want kids wear mask. dont understand it, data pretty much solid mask work little bit helps. feeling want move, separate society together. remind spoiled children. lack leadership politicians part lets misinformation spreed like wildfire.  True...but I'm geared towards actual identification problem creation implementation genuine solution. Sterilizing immunity aiming for. Especially since nobody, legitimately *nobody*, knows end game virus.

Kind like people treated chicken pox long....""oh let get kid, one done, get again."" then.... ah shit, SHINGLES?? Well done Singapore. Aim 90%!! Don‚Äôt know Republicans always do. Whatever wrong, sabotage Democrats trying fix say Democrats failed, even though they‚Äôre ones directly responsible. There's strong lack understanding EUA means, people think really approved still experimental. personally know handful people waiting ""real"" approval (insert eyeroll) prior getting vaccinated. dumb many, every time someone gets shot, win us. Learn burn actually wondering.. since people still get virus vaccinated still spread it, get extremely sick, virus may need mutate. goal virus survival, make people sick. long able spread, need mutate. mean, still mutate, unless mutates something spreads effectively delta, delta win mutations. Meh. Governor Reynolds ignorant. case absolute malice. flawed. Substance default, nothingness is.

Adding imperfect solution negating perfect one. US able completely lock prevent virus even entering country like NZ AUS did, would happened? 

NZ AUS keep breakthrough infections, way ""stop"" virus border. US course island, would impossible control infections North South. choose caution won‚Äôt home anymore though progress lost? overwhelming reality vaccinated, chances going get sick. Full stop. issue children 12 vaccinated, absolutely idea transmissible Delta (or really, virus vaccines) really is. So, shitload uncertainty, rightly so. suggest progress lost, bit dramatic. sure, emotionally, def feels like times...but step back look situation....for part, people actually much better shape, overall. We're still nowhere near close done COVID, tho. still, overall, we're better. mention better research, vaccine dev, understanding virus, etc, etc. also say happy note seems overwhelming majority people live community seem believe science, helps. LOL article gives 2 examples suggest one recent eye-opening report recently highlighted Nature. Among 90,000 in-school pupils learning North Carolina last fall, researchers would expected, based local transmission rates, 900 cases COVID. were, turned out, 32. another study, among 20,000 Nebraska students attending school year were, total, two cases. fully vaccinated Moderna/Pfizer without 2 shots trialed approved. Moderna trialed 1 shot strong chance would approved 1 shot vaccine.

There 2 shot J&amp;J study taking awhile since COVID cases decreased causing harder get efficacy ratings (at least assumption heard results yet). I'm fully vaccinated, news makes sound like vaccines completely worthless. never stopped wearing mask, got vaccine soon possible, stay away crowded places. someone like made feel way would anyone skeptical ever get Vaccine?  fear mongering backfiring. believe delta breakthrough infections due fast variant reproduces body rather actually evading vaccines.

Well guess evade vaccines sense, ‚Äúevades‚Äù moving fast. Ah vaccinated people never interact unmasked years come? Yeah sorry following people won‚Äôt either I‚Äôm at? Mostly yes. number would say would meaningful? Step up? idiotic unvaccinated jackasses ‚Äústep up‚Äù US, RSV child deaths 100-500. Flu 150-200. population much UK. 1000 children dying per year illnesses UK? point hundred deaths due communicable disease cause shutting schools, we'll shut schools literally every single year already existed communicable diseases cause hundred deaths per year. mean take seriously things address (certainly makes sense elementary kids CAN'T vaccinated mask), put proper context. terms kids, covid magnitude threat things kids already face every year prior pandemic. means get fully number end next summer (assuming ramp up)? given many get etc, maybe mostly done start next summer. That's worldwide. Crazy.  obviously true, think anything Americans currently going prevent ""authoritarianism"" form foolish. got that. good dad sure! someone would need bed time dad treated, keeping bed, pretty horrible - could die, even possible might treated time dad waiting, freeing bed dad needed it. 

Obviously, pretty horrible system, basically triage first come first served, put doctors pretty shitty ethical dilemmas. legal aspect interesting me, given widely malpractice defined US (or least attempted defined). worked vast majority people actively wore them.

Most people stopped vaccines became widely available (probably shouldn‚Äôt have).

Nothing 100%

What motive post? don‚Äôt know lesson learned damage sure think equally hurt Covid, I'm sure smoking. China would dumb enough let virus outside country purpose. 100% saving face politically. hoped contain without raising international stink. was, avoid (for now) sanctions result pandemic. didn‚Äôt care. pure pandering nut job base help boost 2024 presidential run. last year, no. mild case, early on. delta variant getting around vaccince, vaccine keeps bad. pregnancy, viruses dangerous baby, even symptoms mild mother. 

Having much housing insecurity child lot. sucks teaching keeping people poverty way. Yeah, I‚Äôm usually pretty good today. Clearly someone thinking children. neighbor next street sign lawn says ""unmask children"". live rhode island. people idiots. 3rd child born everything happened fast OB chance put mask. head cleared canal huge gush amniotic fluid hit square face. Shoulda happened long time ago

Apart public health issues, can‚Äôt handle staffing shortage potential liability COVID-rats infecting patients thoughts vaccinated wearing mask is: probably don‚Äôt actually need wear mask me, don‚Äôt want enable nonvaccinated people pretend vaccinated spread covid others.

At point places don‚Äôt want check vaccine status demand everyone vaccinated us everything right got vaccinated keep wearing masks unvaccinated people trying get away vaccinated wearing masks social distancing Vaccines forced required rejoin society. free decline able bring kids school, eat out, etc. tons existing illnesses already public schools. Covid different. [Pfizer, AZ, JNJ drug safety people taking kids concerts clubs? aren‚Äôt putting N95 masks kids easily get now? 

As everyone else excuse getting vaccine you‚Äôre worried wear N95 mask. ""The American Academy Pediatrics"" pharmaceutical company conducting clinical trial. That's good stuff works France. said pretty much Europe.

Yeah heard lot people talking something like that. Apparently 50% population gets flu vaccine every year. never really considered before. course, young time. fully believe health insurance shouldn‚Äôt cover them. 

Honestly expect happen full FDA approval comes  ""therefore, findings cannot used infer causation. Additional prospective studies larger populations warranted support findings.""

It's interesting study, limitations portion it, make question whether really say definitively saying. could eradicate political will. don't.

Pretty much every article days plays game lumping vaccinated people without taking account vast majority probably weren‚Äôt actually exposed first place. literally tells us nothing. Nobody's done trials this. guess would 2 doses month apart would useless, 2 doses 6 months apart would best (if that's option). natural infection previous vaccination vectored, one mRNA dose boosts antibody levels high. I'm willing get third shot. thing bothers is, people countries access first shot yet. vaccine better spent people. Let's protect many people quick covid juice left everybody else jabbed take another one. Yep :

YeR rEeSerch! people spreading gotten vaccinated that‚Äôs problem.

Covid type virus can't that. gone, gone. absolutely true. person responding must exposed 4chan troll variety anti mask/vax asshole. random boomer anti-mask likely believes disinformation fed 15 years without even flash critical thought, doesn‚Äôt believe cause chaos. really think righteous correct actions. Unpopular opinion: antivaxxers going ""risk it"", deserve medical treatment get sick. Let die. Wow... repeating yourself. make claim, refute it, repeat first claim again. 

This waste time. interested ""winning"" actually debating ideas. commenter seemed babe suggesting been. Considering [Rod symbol medical profession, it‚Äôs exactly equivalent. (Not fellow Americans. Wrong Greek!) odds ""new"" infection zero. antibodies cells immune system quickly flooded bloodstream fight original infection (thousands billions virions) still there, addition dozen inhaled virions would make difference compared ones already defeated.

It's certainly possible never defeated original ones though. infection could still ongoing. likely body recovering. would definitely expect still test positive time point regardless.

Stay hydrated get rest. Downvote spam sub nuts. I've stopped down-voting anyone point. It‚Äôs also pretty spot-on overlay something else won‚Äôt talk about. ;) mask helps helps others, probably moreso vastly outnumbered describe.

I mean, would stop wearing seatbelt nobody else wearing one driving? Pretty much cars front side airbags now, right?

That's getting at. Yes, vaccines great. Masks good. layer good atop great, happy great. is, always, call make. Targeted propaganda campaigns fellow science nerds wondering technology, appears virus-like particle displaying receptor-binding domain icosahedral paper describing platform. Per article 7737 breakthrough infections total.

That means CFR 1.3% among breakthrough infections. Seems kind high. short story hacking coughing hotel restaurant bothering cover mouths. people asked considerate things got heated. asked leave, things got worse took tried leave province hiding ferry terminal.

Needless say cops caught couple arrested think. 

It nuts. Since people area deadset opening border. cases relatively low compared rest province we're also terrified folks getting sick. lot elderly here. Good thing got back school. Thankfully, one remained true. American conservatives gotten stuck first one. Yeah, use lot, interface great. know long COVID, I'm sure relates shingles analogy.

This whole ""end game"" talk ""what capable of"" make sound like video game villain.

Here's know ""end game."" one except eradicating it. Otherwise keeps mutating changing. Sometimes better, sometimes worse. Thanks info! Glad working it. feeling given already know safety platform efficacy mRNA vaccines, release sooner rather later. don‚Äôt think anybody pointed medicine (includes vaccines) FDA (I‚Äôm assuming countries similar laws) require testing humans drug first tested animals. He‚Äôs famous working aids crisis botched badly people accuse government intentional spreading HIV. 60% fully vaccinated. hospital finally said get jab get out. care appear minority. though!

My one wish would create vaccine kids. Adults, seemingly, barely wear mask right. chances children have? * pass works whether vaccinated tested negative within 48 hours. frankly, travelling abroad vaccinated, pity you

* need pass France, need access places.  Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Helsinki late January 2020. Pretty much Chinese tourists masked up. wearing gloves wearing makeshift PPE. remember thinking precipice something terrible wondering knew didn't.  pro-masker? (Is we‚Äôre defining now, haha) agree downsides significant make valid point. 

What alternatives then? part adult population victims misinformation. part vaccine hesitant part gotten vaccinated. 2 parts 3 parts mentioned probably going allow children get vaccine yet maybe even ever putting potential danger. 

The older variant (alpha?) wasn‚Äôt severe threat children, however, don‚Äôt know yet Delta states large numbers children ICUs speak covid. 

I absolutely agree mental health crisis yes, shouldn‚Äôt put burden do? let Covid pass schools, allow kids see friends family end ICU‚Äôs, die ask safety peers themselves, wear mask help reduce spread get thing least little control? 

I appreciate hearing side don‚Äôt mean sarcastically. needs conversations rather name calling, etc. It‚Äôs absolutely ok, walk they‚Äôre not, decline answer. 

Asking someone HIPAA violation, prohibited telling you. like anyone ask status, tell them. 

A medical professional can‚Äôt tell *anyone else‚Äôs* vaccination status own. Google says smallpox vaccine provided sterilizing immunity 95% effective.

Don't think breakthrough cases imply vaccine can't grant sterilizing immunity effective on. Ive already seen this. went first time month, work, half peoplenwerent wearing masks. even though I'm vaccinated. ounce prevention worth pound cure that. reminds grown version character Mandy Moore played Saved.

Admitted hospitalized. know this? page ~28 here. Moderna *is* tests delta spike, already done multivalent (wildtype+beta spike) vaccines. booster initial spike 6 months increased delta neutralization higher wildtype neutralization second dose - incredibly promising.

The logic commonly given vaccines ""good enough"" already better spike ""needed"". makes sense. vaccine efficacy could improved even 1% switching correct spike would well worth it. Canada vaccine passport yet one December. emails got shots I'm waiting get vaccine passport sorts move overseas third that.

Yeah. learned kindergarten never wrestle pig, end dirty pig like it. think incredibly naive think vast majority anti maskers misinformed truly believe masking ineffective/ limiting etc. case articles like would far effective convincing misinformed people. fail miserably individual concerns values, sticking perceived opponent (whether liberals, democrats, scientists, elites, etc).

In age social media, conversation debate something obviously true vs somethin zero merit comes cost amplifying spreading bad information also lifting valid side two sided issue. end almost irrelevant believes held good faith, dog whistle something else. argument convince someone world round help spread information people, serves spreads false idea flat others. Likewise treating person thinks world flat silly, much information evidence logical explanation choosing believe world flat spite evidence pointing otherwise.

it's like debate virology vs terrain theory. point real damage done debate something well studied proven, something without real merit whatsoever.  3 days barely able move least another week lingering discomfort. I'd tomorrow Nope yet admited covid admitted things tested positive covid? huge difference, also many underlying conditions. deaths dramatically reported. disseminator lies misinformation.

Actually underreported, least Northeast. There's people died even tested COVID recognized country despite various groups traveling Italy outbreak coming back infected. Perhaps one analysis confirmed cases virus mutations indicating European origin, meaning travelers flying New York City Europe brought virus.[1] Americans visiting Italy late February returning New York March 1 asked customs spent time Italy, even though State Department urged Americans travel Italy February 29 (the day Italy reported 1,100 COVID cases). According statistical models, New York City already 600 COVID-19 cases mid-February, many 10,000 cases March excess mortality analysis, double many deaths expected New York City March 4 April 4.

So please, stop spreading lies misinformation. Excess mortality takes normal flu year account. Well, that's it. Can't live life dead. surely seem like problem take care itself. vast majority anti-mask crowd give shit people want wear masks feel safe again.

In fact I'd argue they'd huge proponents personal freedom wear mask. Sure loonies going mock tease bad apples everywhere. 

I think anti-mask folk want left alone told do. That's efficacy rate touted corona virus vaccines catching virus severe symptoms. corona virus vaccines never sterilized strains. Can't fake full hospitals dead bodies. one day face people end disabled piss poor decisions based nothing.
It's like DeSantis know virus kills disables, care long donations keep coming.

This definitely vocal minority Reading requirements let (PCR negative test double shot), I'm opinion visitors moving needle case counts. unvaccinated local population far larger far bigger threat, cases rising prior is. BC went sub 50 daily cases 450 3 weeks expulsion/fired. wants liars associated school. 

If get caught falsifying anything application disqualified.  different fake Covid vaccination record puts others health risk. three different onsets fever different extremes fever. 

RSV 5 days spiked fever 102.5 huger initial onset symptoms. takes 2-8 days exposure initial showing early symptoms. RSV makes areoles lungs inflamed, impeding intake oxygen. also inflame bronchial tubes. 

COVID symptoms fever 2-14 days exposure. COVID fills children‚Äôs lungs fluid.

Parainfluenza (croup) onset symptoms 2-7 days exposure. Croup ends it‚Äôs run croupy cough that‚Äôs dry barking bronchial tubes. 

So child three, child undergoing bronchial tubes cannot intake air, inflamed areoles cannot absorb oxygen, fluid lungs prevent lungs fully filling. see, variable state, would go Florida (even normally also, hot summer!) northern states seem control.

I hope able go hicking White mountains fall friends, stay far higher risk area. thing is, people ICU months unlike last time, younger previous batch patients take longer die. experience Ontario anyway last wave, offered elderly vaccinated.   engineered then? lockdown curfew now, lack vaccination (20% metro France 60%). problems deal with.

You could try asking /r/Masks4All sub masks.  great hear. I'm hoping great influence rest country given many service members come southern states. One regional health system placing special sticker name badges vaccinated. Two fold pupose:

* Help identify vaccinated staff patients
* ""Reverse scarlet letter"" shame vaccinated.

This health system also requiring vacciation 09/01/21. vaccination, job. verified exceptions allowed. Period. employment state.  nothing new. still predicated idea vaccine full FDA approval then. friend professional softball player Olympic alternate. Covid-19 killed her. may help slow spread, really stop it.

Actually can. statistical thing. everybody wears mask, R0 drops, is, infected person infects fewer people. R0 stays 1 pandemic eventually burns out. soon depends low R0 goes. lower better.

But already know that, we. need translate knowledge conviction, conviction action. US Borders currently closed seem high number people crossing borders many different places last months.

\-In countries cannot actually close borders, mercy every new -wave started somewhere else world. would likely dealing border patrol initially, federal agents. doubt would let forging federal documents slide. "" 91 percent unvaccinated"". shocking. People scared restrictions returning they‚Äôre scared virus itself, news coverage past 2-3 weeks probably scared rolling sleeves.  Someone needs invent app phone uses location anyone whose got spare doses press button notify 5 closest people waiting jab instantly, call clinic text say they're way decline. lots people reach old age diagnosed medical conditions. old underlying condition universal. 

My grandmother lived alone 88 years age died stroke. good family friend grandmother produced aerobics video 90. uncommon people took care drew long straws genetically. There's also bit racism story too. Here's great podcast episode it: People told getting vaccinated way restrictions. fully vaccinated people planet won‚Äôt start wearing masks again. come 1.5 years on, still checking fact masks important work? Hell yeah, brother  Legitimate question: vaccinated people masking for? 

The vast, vast, vast majority vaccinated need ICU bed infected (&lt;1%), likely pre-existing conditions would make outcome fairly predictable. vaccine pretty much ended random ‚Äú30 year old pre-existing conditions needs double lung transplant 6 months ICU‚Äù anecdote.

Theoretically ""doesn't seem complicated,"" yet is. this, privilege living normal life bring attention Andrew cuomo , joe Biden CNN last year trump President saying won‚Äôt trust vaccine weary it. Biden President it‚Äôs exact opposite. numerous videos telling public trust government.

It‚Äôs said government fights citizens expense makes us turn other. It‚Äôs responsibility diligent say sensationalist BS like cable tv ratings. politicians. another nutjob enters fold‚Ä¶ Except people wearing masks getting vaccinated want inconvenienced positive test. They'd say 200760% accurate use them. love entirely legal. Military service members already required spate vaccinations. significant number anti-vaxxers military regarding covid, comply lose jobs. someone works diagnostics, device cool proof concept doubt see real adoption SARS-CoV-2; least current format. 

What have:

1. Moderately low cost per unit
2. Totally hands off
3. equipment needed

What lacks:

1. test takes WAY long home use. People hard time waiting seconds/minutes let alone hour. 
2. Fluorescent output non-ideal home use. multitude reasons home tests (for disease) use fluorescence reporting.
3. device rather large single use product. Manufacturing costs costs getting product consumer, shipping costs, shelf space, etc. increase cost per unit. size device going result significant shipping shelf space costs. size per test preclude use low-wage areas could useful. Delta easily outcompetes strains right now. overwhelming number cases US almost every jurisdiction Delta. Really, point safe happy.  Temp checks ineffective. Parents dose kids home come fever. Kids coming cold outside show inaccurate results. Kids coming summer recess show false positives. equipment districts afford accurate start with. districts can't afford expensive data acquisition systems, manually entered data susceptible human entry errors. 

Giving teachers cheap laser temp testers Amazon answer either. untrained people pointing lasers near kids eyes every single day insane. Many people hear ""immune"" think means 100% immunity, person gains infection. Considering types willing/able send kids private schools, I'm sure that. can't use ""definitely"" speaking people things anymore. sense told would common not, last ""presidency"" still shook regard people allow grand scale. 

I hope Austin follow. find hilarious homework school knew fact teacher would check somehow exam related. Obviously great arguments anyway teachers know kids without pressure . developed India cheap test results good PCR test according press release.

But non market yet. Would helped decreasing covid cases alot almost got end it. looks like leaders bothered 


I tested negative antigen test tested positive PCR. though disproportionately kill base 

Every day another minor conservative note dies. Radio guys, state local government reps. big money names; they're vaccinated.
Why can't see con? answered via cohort studies. ie, groups vaccinated people tested weekly compared control group similar exposure risk. yet schools remain open 12‚Ä¶ hmmmm‚Ä¶ Oh boy. going go great enlisted folks know. Agree. ever see kids eyes glued screen 10 front face use common sense research own! stupid CDC told people wear masks long time beginning pandemic. Thousands upon thousands died due ridiculous advice. live one nearby burbs Dallas I'm praying God also wise bullshit implement mask mandate remote learning.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* they're going informed consent waiver instead going wait full FDA approval makes unnecessary. think good move even though pushes back vaccinations; informed consent waiver always going highly problematic.

This also signal inside FDA full approval assured come next weeks.

A significant number servicemembers going resign anyway; that's tradeoff making. think deny treatment, someone vaccinated needs bed one, someone unvaccinated kicked one they're using. We're getting point choices made gets use treatment resources ought people tried avoid needing them. ""positive discrimination""? I'm sure everyone discriminates thinks right reason. Dumbest response I've ever read.  vaccine perfect protecting isn‚Äôt force field protects enough me.

For COVID make vaccine irrelevant would drastically change DNA dependent heavily spike protein little chance happening. 

Once parents putting N95 masks children worried keep away crowds. get Lateral Flow test kits Pharmacy UK free.  way Broski, half country shitting motherfornicating pants ""standard protocols"" ""too fast"". CDC/FDA always going no-win situation matter do, going either piss 50% public off. diverse country ours. home send lab truly home get results too? I've seen CVS ones I've seen still require send somewhere. also $30 expensive still. that's several meals folks. read separate sentences present tense linked theme responsibility ultimately resting him, regardless governor does, makes sense.

At end day, responsibility me.

Something happens, responsibility me.

Things go sideways, responsibility me.  we're never going back, COVID endemic. Even 90%+ vaccination including kids we'll cases there-- even San Mateo cases despite 90%+ 12+ vaccination. part fairly well-controlled here. shut Louisiana can't grown-ups? 

Why would teachers go back they're vaccinated? believe vaccines, either? Good Lord.

The education system collapse countries kept schools open. would collapse nationally? focus, interpreted it. specify ""not dismiss"" purpose.

My focus important factual COVID many rumors lies circulating about. can't fall pit. think sowing chaos disruptive thing boils spiting perceived opponent.  


The boomer say true believer usually true believer. I'm rural virginia, anti mask crowd anti mask science. send incontrovertible science find matter explain detail data gathered proof. Care. masking. culture war behind issue.  literally cutting nose pwn libs.  


This important understand wasting time effort fight problem wrong way. Rational discourse, evidence, studies, etc prove something self evident world round convince people ever issue itself. People ignore extent normal slow part vaccine development testing see works, testing works much faster pandemic difference vaccinated vs unvaccinated shows month rather years.  Washington endorsed mandate smallpox vaccine. Public schools already vaccine mandates place ton viruses. mandates constitutionally illegal, would challenged long 2021.

Masks nose, vented, poorly fitted pass ""compliance"". area, mandates ensured people mask face. Countless people wore wrong used vented masks, defeating entire purpose them.

Mask mandates effective vaccine. Oh allowed mask mandate, default allow vaccine mandate exact reasons. understand viewpoint thankfully, government headed proposed direction. like DeSantis know virus kills disables, care long donations keep coming

Oh no, sure does, optics keep money votes coming even though disproportionately kill base lol. First I‚Äôll say I‚Äôm one downvoting here. sure people that. 

Another piece puzzle getting hospital surgery. got test done local community hospital. order get surgery, go larger regional tertiary care center, already shut intake. doctor said realistic way get right transfer patient, part reason admitted him. larger hospital. 

Personally I‚Äôm happy doctor took seriously admitted him. serious enough getting surgery week (after catching disorder Wednesday) doctor said it‚Äôs safe put off. sense, see ‚Äúhey, guy doesn‚Äôt really need bed Thursday‚Äù argument, Thursday couldn‚Äôt get in, push back surgery week, month? could serious negative outcomes him. doctor felt best way preserve life admit would sure, 100% get surgery week. 

I‚Äôm happy doctor forward thinking enough consider COVID surge getting worse Florida, sad doctor think people won‚Äôt get vaccine. anti-mask, anti-vaxx mentality form cancer. true, antimaskers antivaxxers, poor nations limited vaccine rollouts allowed virus progress mutate. viruses do. exactly predicted would happen people listen facts. Every teacher know NYC vaccinated months now.

We continue wear masks buildings too.

I read comments teachers states conservative saying freakishly conspiratorial shit though.

I cannot wait see many willing risk livelihoods opposition mandated vaccinations. want something real upset planet burning, kids wearing masks slow spread deadly virus. thought guess maybe since fed needs deal states could wrong don‚Äôt see difference Kroger requiring vaccine card? America. Look world news. Many nations (France, Germany, Italy, Australia) citizens protesting mandatory vaccines, lockdowns, restrictions, etc. everyone armchair FDA know-it-all like you. apologies knowing process, please patient don't. goes lot asshole it.


If emergency authorization happened, tests/whatever done time, mean would get ""approval"" end tests? get idea ‚Äòthey don‚Äôt tell you‚Äô, question is, ask someone blatantly lie it, something illegal?

From AAP site. issue schools opening without mask enforcement without regard using science direct decisions! Yes agree AAP ; would much safer things book -- -- therefore send kids school.

I'm saying answer entire problem (where stipend money resources come from, suggestion idea - something fully fleshed ready rolled Congress sign) saying ""going back way things used be"" going work.

And schools already started regimen already walk back due entire classes quarantined one person tests positive. feel going less 60-70% that's roughly previous strains (but map, studies show 50%, 94%), it'll probably less vs delta. I'm mainly hoping remains protective hospitalisation death. specifically said J&amp;J vaccine weaken time far. doubt Sacramento something batshit crazy else would expect, evidence seems indicate J&amp;J vaccine spike protein vaccines may uniquely equipped handle Delta, specifically, especially given results coming UK (and prevalence AZ vaccine). flu evades vaccine every year (that's need new one every year), still harmful. Given incubation period virus, seriously doubt would become less harmful. Generally happens viruses kill victims fast, selection pressure toward virus lets victim live longer spread more.  one specifically neutralize delta virus would make easier destroy exposure. likely could get efficacy back 94-96%. They've already missed 1.25 school. we're talking another year. That's like 20% k-12 education. I'm parent see massive deal.

The end day, hadn‚Äôt COVID they‚Äôd alive. reads like onion headline  trying get advantage team forfeit sold protecting getting Covid. fact people trying disingenuous really pushing people skeptical. honest people upfront, don‚Äôt sell something not. course surprised. sold cure said didn‚Äôt need wear mask anymore! 

Get vaccinated, protection, lets pretend messaging hasn‚Äôt good haven‚Äôt moved goalposts. misinformed. No, not. take medication prevents mounting good immune response covid shots makes 32 times likely severe outcome/die covid. normally worry dying trip grocery store could normally expect minimal impact illness lifespan. real mental gymnastics here

They died contracted Covid. Therefore Covid killed them.  Come on, man - cut crap. Thanks links -- skimmed abstracts point, seem informative.

I think me, really frustrating thing appears current state research summed 2 sentences second randomized trials conducted effect masks covering mouth nose. limitation studies analyzed cases, effect cannot viewed isolation protective impact measures (distancing, hygiene precautions).

I'm sure ethical constraints stop lot RCTs occurring, still guess really wish better methodologies separate much masks much interventions orientation Orlando. Every single person masked kids all. Sure somewhat optional, many want write note teacher telling want kids wear mask. can't imagine better way teacher hate us son note. go pick kids see one mask I'll know immediately mom dad POS. I'm sure different county would acceptable.  Definitely though.  

My son friend anti vaxx mom. Even constantly masked. say good Floridia, areas care. Good point! really encouraging think way. Sometimes get overwhelmed worry falling behind. credit, called wife &amp; begged get vax went ventilator, credit, willing go national media share story terrible avoidable predicament.

She knows she‚Äôs going face backlash criticism &amp; vitriol agreed interviewed anyway. believe stories impact &amp; I‚Äôm thankful people finally right thing &amp; speak save others.    too. think life may come back normal next year us poorer countries receive vaccines need end year.  gamble we‚Äôre taking.

gamble key word. people decided go conservative wagers others bet house 24, spun wheel hoped best That's bad idea.  Well, long COVID interfere education too, ALSO long-term health. We're number one!

Edit: sigh. s/  None yet. Since it‚Äôs inactivated vaccine (I think), there‚Äôs data match give you. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs similar AZ data, won‚Äôt give conclusive answer lack data differentiation Sinovac vaccines. ballpark would 60-70% effective. Totally agreed. I'm excusing them, sympathizing bit. really is. want protect want properly educate them. worked pretty last school year know wasn‚Äôt good school. don‚Äôt listen cooperate work hard like school.   would impossible. Even viruses actually sort thing need really specialized enzymes facilitate that. Enzymes human body make. HIV it, hides immune system. Newsflash: kids six pretty good (better lots adults) wearing masks it‚Äôs big deal wear  ""Could""???

It certainly *will*. Taurus works lists. exactly, basically coach say ""I can¬¥t force anybody, decide plays""  Yeah like virus grows exponentially anything, really gonna hurt us add even 20 infectious people day crowded retail tourism spots? mean going fully vaccinated there's chance going fake things all. fine. /s  Saving grace vaccination rates good slowed going continue get even better. sure hell would complain learned shit toilet people still try put diapers Joe street never learned.


Stop pushing weird diaper fetish everyone.  Well mean hey that's feel that's feel. I'd curious see sequence data that's out. vaccinated 25% likely catch it, based stat?

Sounds like expect based vaccines. unlikely due memory B cells. Using numbers, would 75% effective:

1000 vaccinated people w/ 20 cases = 2% attack rate 
1000 unvaccinated people w/ 80 cases = 8% attack rate

Efficacy calculated subtracting vaccinated rate unvaccinated rate, dividing unvaccinated rate (see would (8 - 2) / 8 equals 0.75, 75%. virus mutates slowly, let's hope best. thought virus needed choose infectious like flu deadly ebola, see simple. thought like needed choose one thing another. That's seen yet (even ""resistant"" strains pfizer moderna still really good against) still won‚Äôt care. Lots people dragging kids around masks. Toddlers cry put diapers on, too. 

Should let dribble shit everywhere? get reaction us No, wife says they're antivaxxers, seem find important. would wonderful! initially feeling urgency pediatric vaccines, rising cases living South, want kids vaccinated ASAP. think parents position probably feeling way, kids protected high community vaccination like kids areas are. recent data set Rna vaccines 49% efficiency infection due Delta. vaccinated infections transmissible non-vaccinated reduce faster. We're coin flip, yet there's change mask guidelines restrictions mitigation efforts 'please get vaccinated.' Getting really close 'end rope' territory, perfectly honest.   Look, ones choosing get vaccinated selfish halfwits think anyone else consider ramifications even themselves, friends family.

We taxing holy hell requiring vaccinations employment across types employers, public private.

More that, people get COVID, need start refusing medical treatment. 

They're murderers, plain simple. reserve medical resources deserving treatment.

The virus care antibodies made response vaccine infection. evolves presence antibodies way avoid antibodies vaccine resistance happens.

It's much likely happen unvaccinated person developing antibodies active infection, result low number antibodies develop someone high level antibodies immediately neutralize virus chance mutate.

Vaccines available yet kids masks help - - people GREATLY overhyped magic anti covid force field they're nothing sort. Maybe Republicans, moderate independent voter vote otherwise? DeSantis gonna hot them, imo. whole testing/concept tracing effort seems deprioritized vaccine rollout started :(

Where cheap ubiquitous rapid tests? sewage testing portal? *anyone* even contact tracing anymore? Got third, sore arm side effects, first 2.

I understand many people like me, still feels weird 3 shots side affects Border controls real enforced two week quarantines first important measures Korea (and Asian Pacific countries like Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand etc.). helps effective island. 

Then test trace, masks, finally social distancing. 

In countries cannot actually close borders, mercy every new wave started somewhere else world. 

Even wearing masks stop everything. 96% American doctors. Right. hundred deaths thousand hospitalizations unacceptable, cause distance learning keeping kids person school, people propose address influenza future we're covid pandemic? may well true. think broader point don‚Äôt know. Uncharted territory here. Maybe sail fine - quite possible. maybe hit rock sink. Probability unknown. 

Just fact we‚Äôre discussion demonstrates stakes. Two years ago, pre-pandemic, would seemed unimaginable. *is* approved though. It‚Äôs approved emergency use.

The safety standards exact emergency use full authorization. difference amount data re: longevity efficacy. 

Also, FWIW, **no vaccine side effects EVER arisen vaccine two months vaccination**

That‚Äôs bc vaccines specifically created broken dispelled body rapidly evoked immune response looking for. really great news, correct? see used travel purposes, instance. That's really irresponsible you. much guilt feel someone work gets seriously sick dies took Covid work? Liberty, Equality, Fraternity. go together. Freedom exist vacuum. ploy seems bogus me.

I mean, article literally says they're pretending. bogus definition. good, since Abbott actively trying kill kids citizens protect kids. way. hospital jam packed full unvaccinated. Throw card away. state record. need prove vaccinated anyone. health community largely skeptical masks *in untrained hands*; objections saw revolved around ""people put properly, fit tested, they'll touch time"".

Not ""they work even used trained surgeon"". understand perspective, individuals buy in, government fuck stop spread short shooting people spot... happening. guess that's ultimately point - there's much done without people buying in, are. guess brings back original question: evidence young people significant risk suffering severe consequences COVID catch it?

That certainly changed understanding illness spread change, certainly surgeons would alone prior COVID-19 Congrats adding nothing value discussion. taking piss someone else makes happy, it.

We‚Äôve colds since pandemic began causes much anxiety leads days work would never normally taken Honestly problem everything society days.

Vaccines 100% either.

But combine two, they're shockingly effective, regardless vaccine get mask wear. Add minor behavioral changes, snowballs.

This compounding benefit. really different compounding interest works. invest $2 get invested $1. stack multiple methods get benefits one.

It's especially stupid given even cloth mask 20-50% effective depending study. That's vaccine effectiveness taken account. means vaccine working prevent illness 50-80% virus wear mask. simple piece cloth. Cheap KN95's extremely effective. Like 80-90%. knock another 20-50% stupid behavior changes like keeping little space strangers.

Risk reward compound. allowed stack benefit. That's works. That's investments work. That's education works. That's life works.

Don't idiot.

It's like people argue savings accounts investments.. ‚ÄúOpen business!‚Äù (for now) Fast enough matter, getting it, individual :) fast enough stop spread metric matter. sound like covid deniers.

As somehow, two people wrong, one person wrong somehow okay.

It's particularly dumb moment Cuomo became plain, sane liberals rejected him.

Recently trip back midwest, airport wife said ""wow. forgot large people are"" (in like totally objective non-judgemental way) Actually Florida, ratings tanking hard. start kicking COVID patients eligible vaccine chose get vaccinated.

No one else affected poor decisions best ability, try make sure that's case. I'm guessing mean grade-through-high school. varies state. every state gave teachers preferential access, think around April vaccines available pretty much adults US. issue: still really important quantify efficacy, really found studies really done satisfactorily [it seems real-world studies can't disentangle impact masks vs. impact CDC's now-famous slides, suggested efficacy masks 20-30% efficacy personal protection 40-60% efficacy source control ([slide However, provide sources estimate, (somewhat maddeningly) differentiate different types masks.

Masks certainly work. -- lower-cost intervention -- certainly zero cost intervention. weigh costs vs. benefits policies mask mandates (particularly vaccinated), it'd nice better understanding strong benefits   feel you. spent whole adult life (30 now, got really going right turning 28 pandemic) working way music industry lol

At least I‚Äôve tons time record music home get way better that. Guess it‚Äôs new reality tricep burned day.  part of, ""Being overweight ITSELF"" understanding?

The core concept? Probably downvoted dig Taiwan part China. cite E Pluribus Unum argue people think choose differently you‚Ä¶ sow division call unity. Know info? mild case covid vaccinated absolutely spread people.

People assume covid terms act regard people, get tested.

That's fear mongering, good public policy. unspoken truth one wants talk about.

1. COVID airborne proven earlier year (even though knew full year beforehand). Cloth masks probably reduced amount particles get spread older variants good stopping droplet transmission, airborne particles showing evidence lingering environment extended periods time escape mask.
2. Delta transmits substantially higher rate due absolutely massive increase virus particles sheds, meaning even brief encounters someone transmitting infect individual much quicker now. Contact tracing showing last month. also R0 rate reported nearly high chicken pox. surprised key Delta's higher spread viral load also 'more' airborne previous strains (though yet proven).
3. Schools masks spread less virus, likely high enough amount significantly reduce spread. everyone sitting 6 feet (or less) apart room 8 hours without vaccine.
4. this, fashionable cloth masks likely significantly reduced effect reducing spread preventing transmission. Surgical masks would better, many gaps virus still escape with. Anybody covering nose mouth (which still lot mask wearers) jack shit stop spread.

N95s KN95s mask types rated effectively enough stop spread, latter also quite effective (due different Chinese manufacturing standard since KN95 chinese variant N95), former impossible find average person (there scams knockoffs everywhere, real deal shortage since pandemic began).

The practical advice give people use KN95 pick good quality versions possible. Anything less may well little Delta main spreader. ***not*** case previous variants. whole department near think big deal big BBQs every weekend.  probably need yearly boosters. I'm saying boosters ever needed everyone, lot low risk people may beneficial wait see tailored version winter spring, especially they're continuing follow mask guidance. anti-vaxx position follow current guidance medical professionals. Period. End story.

It's frustrating everything either ""the vaccine God never fail"" ""the vaccine work all."" hate politicized is. different different people given age, health circumstances like medicine. coming somebody rushed first chance got got mine legitimately.

It‚Äôs badges work Good.   fact you‚Äôre suggesting surgical n95 masks, thus disrupting proper fitment utility N95 indicates idea you‚Äôre talking fearmongering.

You‚Äôre literally wrong accounts talking vaccinated individuals. 100%. know vegans literally medically necessary animal testing.  
Another point anti-vax vegans forget vaccine also given animals prevent unnecessary suffering. Veterinary science product animal testing research. someone refuses vaccinate animal testing, take pet veterinarian medical treatment would get result animal testing.

But secondly, second person I've seen pull 458 number, that's quiiiiite calculated. actually lot closer correct person, say breakthrough hospitalization number 7500/168mm. said, full tranparancy, important understand looking rate vaccinated individuals hospitalized divided number vaccinated infected individuals, comparing rate non-vaxxed, hospitalized divided number non-vaxxed infected. still great see incredible low number (7500 vaxxed people 168mm hospitalized died,) also important remember vast majority 168mm never got infected first place. Moderna trials, something like 5% unvaxxed control ended infected. 

Themoreyouknow.jpg Yeah point. personally want know info! I'm curious concerned evident reasonably large percentage vaccinated people spread virus? thinking possibility giving Covid someone (also vaccinated) compromised immune system?

I‚Äôm traveling next month Wonder much .4% still around next year.  anti vax brother wife three kids visiting parents town (here Florida) trying guilt trip using nieces coming meet them. made choice I‚Äôve made mine. understand risk put continue put kids in, let alone themselves. always point kids masks. age, get benefit proper masks kids wear kids go school Paw Patrol masks target come different sizes. one convince much anything regards covid.

Obesity absolutely factor I'm trying understand too. Apparently people vaccinated January 16% protection infection now. Yeah, cloth mask recommendation made sense short supply better alternatives, public educated fact better options protect everyone around you, especially contagious Delta is. Sherri Tenpenny doctor. Joseph Mercola. hate much. always gatekeepers. there‚Äôs label it. think would, think culture frowns upon kind thing. Lets show reality war.. keep sending kids middle east... lets show reality covid.. shocked people dont understand risks, get vaccinated. Florida recall process?

It's team sport. hoping it'd sooner, like right second, September 15 (of year, fucking hope!) pretty good, too. Besides older people, nearly everyone know 20s felt little tired maybe cough. cousins college said pretty cool got food delivered everyone covid put un building together actually kind fun. completely un-American. *your* rights, actual Facebook identified.

People thinking proud choosing selfishness taking care fellow Americans world wide pandemic opposite actually makes America great.  continues floor very, many arrogantly stupid people US has. Enormous numbers. Incapable sense scared them. watched Idiocracy recently. Feels like there.

I totally know feel. clear confusion...he talking vaccine. one talking contributing factors COVID complications. Try follow conversation. 

We're talking holding people responsible poor health decisions instead letting poor health decisions affect everyone else. 

Being overweight make burden healthcare system. put people danger either.

Choosing unvaccinated, however, burden healthcare system put people danger. 

Being overweight equivalent unvaccinated whatsoever. 

They're completely distinguishable situations. ""164 million people United States fully vaccinated  
Covid-19, according CDC. Fewer 0.001% individuals ‚Äî 
 1,507 people ‚Äî died fewer 0.005% ‚Äî 7,101 people ‚Äî  
hospitalized Covid-19."" doesn‚Äôt help. 99% cases vaccinated.  Assuming ‚Äúlifelong‚Äù mean seven years‚Ä¶.

Which may true severe cases. Vaccines still offer protection immunocompromised people, case breakthrough infection, would imagine still greater risk complications. immunocompromised, along cannot get vaccinated legit medical reasons, ones would benefit herd immunity, achieved vaccinating many people possible.

My grandma 86 said she'd rather take risks living life normally point take extra precautions. claims much time left anyway worth going eat, events, etc. sure, actually know dangerous Measles is.

But someone says it‚Äôs ‚Äú50% likely‚Äù really mean 150% chance, 1.5x, since it‚Äôs 50% base 100% used comparison Yes. People vaccinated want see family friends 18 long months. feds showed hand. enforcing directive top prove worth.

The right thing make vaccines &amp; masks mandated &amp; grant full FDA approval (for kids). Businesses Working class class cannot survive another lockdown. Unfortunately, Nurses &amp; doctors suffer people refuse get vaccinated, solved vaccine mandate ‚Äúdata‚Äù widely criticized method gathered lack actual data released report. wouldn‚Äôt put ton stock point see something further. Italy, France Cuba's exact thing NYC, (needing vax confirmation gyms theaters, schools). lie everyone see? always able buy gorceries stores, buy fucking store want online, ect. 

You still addressed idiotic say HIPPA practices violated lmfao, IIIIII'm ignorant one. Right. I'll never understand bullshitting public forum. easy see right it. Exhausting.  Could people interested trying confirm think know right wrong interested hearing balanced well thought takes. 

It's funny; that's exactly I'm worried about.

One thing I'm already appreciating discussion I'm watching like difference Reddit thread long essay, even book. one person's highly educated opinion communicated slowly methodically longer period time, balm anxiety, opposed rapid-fire onslaught differing opinions. may needed. I've subscribed YouTube channel really appreciate time. Packed churches lol whole country opened basically pre 2020 levels June many restrictions precautions dropped, including personal level (people going more, wearing masks less). I‚Äôve read Delta people tend test positive become symptomatic quicker (4 days compared 6), California positive cases started exploding 4-5 days 4th July. hard imagine lot antivaxers (who tend skew towards patriotic side) big unmasked BBQs parties 4th, turned big ol‚Äô superspreader events. Breakthrus account 19% known cases, think it‚Äôs still unvaccinated driving shit. holidays going fucking *bloodbath*, they? numbnuts afraid wearing mask would make look silly decided therefore western medicine needed go.

I'm ready feel like I've taking crazy pills. Louisiana - several days higher that. Individual parishes reached 24%. What? saying vaccine protect immunocompromised people? Since pandemic (..no, since Trump) word ‚ÄòAmerican' taken new meaning minds many, good way un-American though. They're total pieces shit. We'd vote island could.  places know of, require ID insurance info. left blank surprise one. Jesus f\* Christ... Brazil absolutely awful situation months ago, yet city hospitals decreased number covid-only ICU beds less 40% last month.

Sure, describe situation whole country, state leading one vaccination, come on, still way behind USA number doses already secured. giving first dose 18\~24 age group next week, USA enough vaccines everyone 18 months now, bloody hell still happening?

Bolsonaro way worse Trump was, dude actively tried hinder efforts buy vaccines, said covid little flu took really long time stop treating Hydroxychloroquine magic potion covid. Even that, small fraction loyal followers still doubt vaccines, usually (we calling people vaccine somelliers like ""I tike Pfizer"" ""Astrazeneca hit like bus, must strongest response""). We‚Äôre not. never been. many variants point adapting vaccine specific variant would like playing whack mole would encourage variants circulate. Much better would create vaccine illicits broadly neutralizing antibody response across variants, seems current generation vaccines somewhat successful regard.  Exactly. Infuriating cdc seemed make recommendation vaccinated people based anti vaxxers. quit making rules anti vaxxers focus people actually want make choices avoid getting covid? Yep  anyone explain calculate ‚Äúx times likely‚Äù percentage vice versa?

Get vaccine mandates pushed state colleges universities. hospitals area announced together institute vaccine mandate employees. 

But let‚Äôs go further. NFL see proof customers enter gate, likewise NBA, MLB, NHL, college football basketball. unvaccinated want kill families, free so. let‚Äôs remove common gathering places rest us get lives. think anti-maskers decline surgeries medical attention all, they've decided clearly know medical science doctors, researchers, etc. Nope, Pfizer shot. comorbiditie(though drastically reduced now), 6 months since second shot, kids start school soon, single income breadwinner, want take chances. *Both tests* done 24-36 hours apart actually supposed reliable PCR. That‚Äôs come 2 tests. Local news reporting St. Pete, FL emergency response times gone average 15 minutes hour times. father two toddlers (one learning walk), I'm practically wrapping bubble wrap. I'm afraid get hurt medical system able attend them. I'm hoping something like Tamiflu, give pill people symptoms go home. choose drive, can't simply choose stop existing order avoid succeptible vaccine mandate. feel way. longer feel excited happy vaccination see vaccinations going - there's millions people telling vaccines way this. want give up. think kids get hurt toy though. is. /s They'd probably spin ""persecuted"" ""beliefs"".  Could people interested trying confirm think know right wrong interested hearing balanced well thought takes. Could actual scientific discussion pretty boring people doesn‚Äôt generate kind interest (and thus clicks ad revenue) ‚Äúexciting‚Äù news. I‚Äôm completely sure, tbh. Racaniello‚Äôs videos criminally underviewed. try point people direction whenever can, great AMA sub months back many points still relevant. remember right UK around 50% vaccinated, would explain high number unvaccinated cases, high number vaccinated deaths. Welp, looks like case solved then. Vaccinated not, old really put disadvantage everything. happened recently, couple americans got caught fake vaccine docs, got fined $20K (CAD) pretty big fine, jail time top would better.
However, they'll forever heavily crutinized time try cross border future. serious (f.i. extreme dementia gets hit hard covid) 

Unless count dementia. Never heard this. think made 2 jabs somewhere January March

If need boosters every four months really bad news. eloquently put. Great, thanks. Looks like FDA gonna suggest boosters couple weeks might try get mine Yea steroids gave helped lot. 4 months. Magic Gathering?  places people following strategies. first strain hard kids would seen tons kids hospitals, localized regions lacked mask mandates, school done person etc. tons people work Hospitals vaccinated. Hey Einstein, guy got hit teeth punched dropped charges said tooth decay gum disease. See stupid line reasoning it? end goal get everyone vaccinated. end goal GET FUCKING PANDEMIC. 

The way happening get everyone vaccinated. going reach herd immunity infections, takes long infect everyone world within time frame needed that. want media show videos happens you‚Äôre vaccinated intubated. Show people reality tube shoved throat. Show X-rays lungs. Get graphical Covid.

‚ÄúThis Covid vaccinated;
This Covid without vaccination‚Äù Remember put covid hospital wards away hospital. took like 5 months later.. Pepperidge Farms remembers. Literally everyone acting like it‚Äôs over.

Not south.

Everyone. would one go getting third shot? 
Doesn‚Äôt state know vaccinated already? heat rough! live tropical country within five minutes I'm sweating like crazy. Glad winter.  elephant room one talking about.

I take issue this. EVERYONE talking it. even government programs specifically designed push [medical track racial demographics' vaccination/infection rates specifically access medical resources difficult certain minority populations USA. Start also good point What‚Äôs church‚Äôs vaccine drive March?  wife ICU doc, used live area wouldn‚Äôt thing stem tide. things calmed spring we, every ICU doc moved area.

It‚Äôs worth it. 80+ hour weeks, what, people ignore public health?

Nah, that‚Äôs like firefighters fighting house fire, owner buddies keep throwing Molotov Cocktails structure. really think Anti-vaxers follow Vaccine mandates? Delta combined version two strains, 2 denovo mutations selected angry reading headline. asking citizens elected officials step up? caused shortage. might remove post it‚Äôs political, exactly what‚Äôs going needs said. Ya it‚Äôs really top sad. It‚Äôs ok assume things online get snarky read something said! Best wishes fam, it‚Äôs really tough hopefully you‚Äôll get start spending time people soon Eat shit. 70% hospitalized....or dead. vax never promised 100% prevent infection. Nobody needed ""admit"" anything. said Delta variant came came from, demonstrate point variants overwhelmingly likely develop unvaccinated areas increasing national vaccination rate 10 20% going anything that. fact never even addressed point, moved straight personal attacks could ""call out"". opposite xenophobic way, since implication want something variants, stop focusing convincing American morons want shot, start focusing distributing many vaccines rest world can.

People like huge reason ridiculous alt right backlash ""wokeness"". Seek professional help.  contribute origin Covid animals zoonosis mentioned paper, evidence shown ongoing likely freak incident. That‚Äôs discount possibility Delta mutating something worse given recent news warnings even statements Fauci disastrous super covid horizon, likely hinted at. Even vaccinated 100% US, global vaccine equity. Vaccinated people also sterilizing immunity. So... variants continue exist, right? 

I've vaccinated since April takes vaccination making deeply uncomfortable confused.  ECMO covid, mortality rate 40% (hey, tried provide source number, post auto-removed link, lmao). Even got one, probably need double lung transplant. Weeks??? move antivax goalposts seconds.../m 88 year old man homeopathy. clearly lost it. US media telling we‚Äôre getting ‚Äúdoomsday variant‚Äù soon. Joey freshwater making sure jabs going arms!! I‚Äôm long covid person. least would def put question. seems rare. get worse vax. sure anyone knows people didn‚Äôt catch Church, especially since church easy place spread.

But bulk people referenced article church got covid hospital dead, that‚Äôs pretty bad. many vaccinated cases serious and/or require ICU? breakthrough cases disappointing, vaccine keeping people hospital, it‚Äôs still valuable. silence him? can't let man speak? decided obsolete must silenced? old? old people forced shut up? Great link. 
There seem huge difference point. It‚Äôs matter beliefs. It‚Äôs viral replication. disposable injectable singles! Perfect getting sunlight bloodsream go! said, trying pull appeal authority argument. guy Luc Montagnier repudiated people still currently active research, well global bodies authority subject, lying covid specifically. removes authority different citing guy gas station.

If Luc believes covid evolves differently everything else ever evolved, even discredited, would take merely saying worth much. would demonstrate why. article even include suggesting why. Merely stating belief.

Did mass vaccination polio amount unthinkable historic blunder creating variants leading death? covid specifically different? Unless point results showing antibodies, buy anyone's claims natural immunity.

But get vaccine anyway. free, harmless recommended public health officials get even person already COVID.

There's good excuse get vaccinated eligible. Churches diseases strange combo due logic use. Cause godly explanation every outcome:

1. Someone gets sick recovers - faith strong
2. Someone gets seriously sick - god testing faith
3. Someone gets seriously sick dies - God called kingdom heaven. better place now. thank correction. fit whole... ""you 99.999% chance survival!"" claim? That's high mortality rate small population poeple body community. pastor actually tending flock Florida?

Woah, think that‚Äôs sign end times. gonna produce study proof this.

I believe second, country 25% vaccination rate 70% new infections vaccinated. saying vaccine work, accusing vaccine actively giving people covid19. pastor gods work  No. situation changed. depend last week‚Äôs weather forecast decide carry umbrella today, look today‚Äôs weather forecast based date information? church till control. Seems easy way best  Also, what‚Äôs total percent population vaxxed vs unvaxxed? They‚Äôll give us better understanding effectiveness. whatever reason

There good reasons, dig science subs find them. Stop spreading misinformation. Base rate fallacy Yep talking book theysay   Lambada? forbidden variant?   read was96%. R0 10 delta vice 3 original..... Kids stay home till vaccinated like to. sympathy. Jesus said disciples, ‚ÄúGet fucking jab.‚Äù curiosity, plan New Zealand? obviously taken strict action prevent outbreaks country, result isolate outside world. What‚Äôs plan future visitors? Cuban Vaccine, portion 70% fully vaccinated, seeing far less hospitalizations would w/o vaccine. Yeah that‚Äôs me. hope tbh. way ever reach herd americas selfishness/deltas r0 drill hospitalized age. 

Current numbers par Aug 20.

Edit: hindsight writing last sentence, ramp look faster. ""It work 100%, therefore worthless"" virus mutates, less likely vaccine work becomes different vaccine work. vaccinate flu everyyear. flu mutates rapidly vaccine work long-term. aren‚Äôt wrong I‚Äôm minority people aren‚Äôt vaccinated. I‚Äôve tested positive mild symptoms also presumed positive family last March mild symptoms. don‚Äôt consider selfish use mask mandate gladly wear mine, also gladly stay away people symptoms. symptom year seen vaccinated people get sick. vaccine issue it‚Äôs get vaccine shitty person even had/have natural immunity. News headlines help cause. wanted freedom kill kids vulnerable, got coronavirus got him. F R E E little dipper less severe big dipper? Name Little Pony characters, least we'll die laughing Polio tough one article says none deceased vaccinated.   shouldn't. 

We let people die focus resources deserving.

Basically everyone else.  reading nurses forum earlier talking this. One hospital 50/50 results another 0 survive. 

The zero survival hospital described waiting long put patients machine.  (sharing context. thought enlightening) TIL recombination thing.....    Hospital staff includes nurses docs, techs, admin, research, billing, food service, sanitation etc. lot people may medical knowledge, 60% still damn low. Sure, honor system. flu/cold like symptom, wear mask try mitigate spreading respiratory disease others courtesy. normal non sick person wearing one protect others may may respiratory disease. generally really see anyone wearing mask sick likely home resting/recovering see someone wearing mask, they're probably way doctor/hospital mostly recovered trying still avoid ""shedding virus"" others. none case, they're wearing black mask+sun glasses, maybe they're celebrity/famous persons trying avoid paparazzi. Victim implies unvaxxed somehow innocent. not. complicit. Title:""49 scientific studies explain do""
-Oh great! Debate over. Done

Second paragraph: ""While researchers 49 studies listed acknowledge there‚Äôs still much data explored, acknowledged efficacy mask-wearing¬†to degree¬†at slowing spread COVID-19""

- degree? Well that's fuckin misleading strike overly critical. I'd love device home use. extremely rough math here: looks like UK peak around 100 deaths per day (equivalent 500 US deaths). US twice many unvaccinated vulnerable population UK. couple weeks could around ~1000 deaths per day. We're 500 right now. Weird comment aside, don‚Äôt know rules federal contractors. imagine health guidelines, really idea. Wouldn‚Äôt surprised make future contractors get vaccine. doubt could make family members get vaccinated, don‚Äôt think beyond children getting vaccinated attend schools. 

I speak experience, soldier currently active duty. Where‚Äôs profit pleb? Worst governor country

Florida. ‚ÄúHold mask.‚Äù cases. vacinnes death hospitalization fewer cases.
With new fatality rate compare agaist normal stuff arealdy h1n1, heart attack, cancer on. Well killing voters ... First I‚Äôm pointing contradicting non stop! That‚Äôs frustrating thing. happen hipster drinks cambucha  Across internet, cottage industry sprung accommodate people say won‚Äôt get vaccinated either personal religious reasons.

Wish media would stop justifying like that. ""bullshit"" reasons, that's it. There‚Äôs enough tin foil world. You‚Äôd need wrap entire house head deal crazy.  would think asthma would better wear mask, less chance inhaling something trigger asthma Indeed, means. forgetting real goal - shareholders. Don‚Äôt worry, soon hospitals full numbers can‚Äôt go anymore.

/s (just case) Yep. get Dollar General 5 minutes, 45 minute drive closest Walmart (the place county currently administering vaccines).  toy children playing caused 85 children admitted hospital one day (in one 50 states), people would arms said toy, would news would recall effort place parents everywhere freaking out. 85 children get sent hospital one day global pandemic supposed worry statistically speaking bad big scheme things.

I'm saying, pandemic really caused us lose perspectives thing. wearing masks stop everything.

Probably one reason South Korea going huge covid wave right now.

I mean, sure, nothing compared US Covid wave, clear masks can't stop everything. I'm sure wave would much worse wearing masks. Likewise ""But approved FDA"" types. Let's see many fuckers rush get jab fully approved weeks. Provide concrete examples China benefiting pandemic please. burden proof shoulders.

You've outlined school mandates constitutional applied elsewhere similar public spaces. religious exemptions key making constitutional, challenged overturned soon exemption removed instead allowing strengthened. OK, keep mind one thing: case, hospital admissions mean child stays hospital. cases, means routing children ER urgent tests.

 right now, Florida 13,776 adults confirmed suspected COVID hospitalized - 201 pediatric patients.

 Here's source: Adult variable total_adult_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid, pediatric variable total_pediatric_patients_hospitalized_confirmed_and_suspected_covid  Dude chance dying long term side effects almost null vaccinated. wearing masks going destroy social life astronomical low chance death. 

March lock country absolutely wrecked mental health long term side effects another lock would definitely worse corona.

 thanks, still going restaurants, gym, hand friends attend lectures university masked so. I‚Äôm pro mask pro vaccine. Selfish brainwashed?

I honestly think Americans aware actions completely dictated taking points whatever news feeds consuming.

The whole argument research total projection twisted. Like reading CDC say invalid googling info Facebook somehow makes one knowledgeable. 

I really think living America sold alternate reality. divided us country mass darwin event continue actual reality prevails. Unfortunately, time, knows survived. given honorable discharge benefits possible way contest it. People get discharged able deploy time things questionable. 

One could take board moment established benefits given honorable discharge won‚Äôt go anywhere. can't find hour walk CVS covid jab past four months? came back France, places already pass sanitaire even mandate.

There's way Americans get qr code. low vaccination rate, complete denial rules necessary. look vaccination rates cases happening, state whole. counties vaccination rates 20-30%. large number tourists country also don‚Äôt follow rules. question side wear it? want know mechanics protection behind one side mask versus other.

Smart companies know we're heading flu season postponed return 2022. Reddit quote , last 8 years. Itll called 10 Year Pandemic. Jesus Christ, like turned TV computer year ago, got COVID info, pretended nothing changed since then. 

Do happen large flightless bird? Scary! find myocarditis? Yes, think care taken stop children catching Covid.

People symptomless Covid found organ damage.

As soon get son vaccinated going too.

See said ""from I've seen Lambda far?"" take mean I'm ""posting expert,"" that's you. Thanks link. That's awful. feel bad kids. There's lot wrong interpretation UK data. First, says 60% reduction symptomatic cases - vaccines never measured reduction asymptomatic cases. Second, measure vaccine efficacy, reduced rates vaccinated versus unvaccinated. assume 25% unvaccinated infected, means 67% effectiveness. also measures AZ Pfizer; Pfizer like 75% probably close see US.  parent I‚Äôm sure do. older kids vaccinated 2 younger ones don‚Äôt quality yet. online school since March 2020 education suffered. sucks. Florida schools open 2 days. Well CDC wrong every front. aprrovial system design speed needed fend pandemic, geared normal rush function. current administration hands last administration. We're actively fighting lead set countries. leaders persuasion sending kids schools children's hospital ICUs filling up. populace refuses take even minimal precautionary measures actively try malicious toward take precautionary measures. we're fed sob stories told REAL victims need feel sorry THEM. way contain misinformation attempts made leadership public private. pittance social safety net even enough basic survival got weakest pandemic aid major country forced mire viral load good luck elderly, high risk children home.

They gall act surprised. actual hell supposed do? Yeah boy gotta catch ‚Äòem all. Pfizer Moderna down, J&amp;J coming next /s dunno.. highly doubt anybody saying 3-4 months ago 20% cases breakthrough cases expected. NY get July August. usually starts couple days September finishes couple days June 30. Jewish holidays affect September schedule, along Labor Day. think school schedule 180 school days total, something like that. pray away, that's got covid week ago. long till get vaccine? Thanks. brilliant idea--let's delay opening go 100% NTI instead taking protective measures know allow students get in-person instruction desperately need. sign $250k+ per year superintendent position? Oh boy. Yeah I‚Äôm going keep responding article literally says I‚Äôve stated start, don‚Äôt like you‚Äôll downvote.

Too bad.  Huh. That's interesting. Nothing like son Oregon.

Politicizing pandemic go one greatest mistakes crimes recent American history.

The interesting thing GOP politicized response, Trump would would control Senate minimum.

Just dumb part.

This continued behavior damning DeSantis well.  really make sense seeing virus mutate multiple times? Aren‚Äôt really dancing around fact immunities inoculations part evolution alongside technology? survival fittest, ain‚Äôt hard grasp, even though snag couple straws there. Totally agree it'll major impact lot places enjoy going require whether cinemas, sporting events, concerts etc. FDA approval huge!!! biggest thing public schools send kids to....need immunization records covid-19 vaccine required (with FDA approval) trouble looking people victims. suckers probably vulnerable psychologically, getting conned. Yes.

If burger joint (or gym) allows in, want enter, that's peaceful assembly. country horrible.  Doc entirely ignoring naturally acquired immunity. Obviously, best path forward vaccination, completely disingenuous act natural immunity exist. anything, seems good vaccine-induce immunity. we're talking reaching 90% immunity reach HIT, need factoring naturally acquired immunity. Decimated means 10% dying. probably bad, bad Where‚Äôs /r/parentsarefuckingstupid need it?

The concern always *possible* complications line kids getting COVID might create, it‚Äôs 100% understood yet.

I‚Äôm parent wouldn‚Äôt gamble kid ‚Äúprobably fine‚Äù mild COVID case, sending back school without vaccines proper restrictions irresponsible point. 86 full. That‚Äôs likely whole lot them. commodities died covid it. Gottlieb recently said cases gonna climb schools open‚Ä¶.I thought gonna go weeks? One day explain step kids lost mom. sucks. Glad getting vaccinated. 

Do know got radicalized? read bunch nutty Facebook groups what.  every month school education loss catch up. Plus teachers like hybrid model. Zoom effectovely became enemy number one worked lasy semester.

Plus high schoolers get vaccinated, need go remote them. Dude refused take wife doctor even though wasn‚Äôt breathing well. ? Horrible tragedy. Yea, certainly believe antivax tragedy-stricken mom's complaints. course everybody else's fault family's. Also hospitals everywhere hardly wait bleed money malpractice trials. 100% fresh bs. brain can't process situation we're 

how ‚Äìas society‚Äì OK risking children's lives? 2.7 million cases almost 40k deaths Florida. Florida one hardest hit states next Texas, New York, Cali. Maybe missed it, Biontech production sites include Pfizer produced? Source? Yeah feel. nearly literally infinite source money pull government won‚Äôt. could support everyone needs stay home, keep economy afloat, beat it. /won‚Äôt/  difficult add COVID test triage? flippant curious. Vaccines trending again.

Vaccines mandatory US military.  uh think call variant comes DeSantis Variant. Fucking madness  Lol blame immigrants supporters eat  mask. Hell, make quite easily paranoid.    They're gonna breaking records while.   I'm ya situation sucks we're learn hard way time seems. know can't afford shutdowns again, depleted savings much last year. Yeah, guess so. still requires pay cut, moving family, etc. great recruitment, they‚Äôll able advertise employees almost 100% vaccination rate. Fair enough‚Ä¶ feel you, also sympathise health authorities sceptical paper card. guess must difficult forge problem see there's really good solution anything global level.

Sure, ""get back normal"" while, everyone got damn shots, even worked desired, soon new variant reduces vaccine's effectiveness mutates goes global again, everything falls apart. (see Delta)

What ""endgame"" requires \~12 billion doses vaccine, produced distributed fast enough knock transmission around world, new variants take hold?

I sure hell good answer that. think good they're encouraging people symptoms get tested though. can't know test.

If symptoms, assume covid proven otherwise.  Freedom end ICU nice big old hospital bill pay life. 

Have fun, stupid!

While you‚Äôre it, don‚Äôt wear seatbelt throw motorcycle helmet, ride. Freedom! oh............""only"" long-haul COVID  NYT usually pretty good. possible kids get long covid, rare. Extremely rare compared adults. 

You're duped information that's true, need maintain perspective. 

A small number reports kids getting long covid mean every kid will. many selfish asswipes don‚Äôt care spread Covid place. idiots scream staff shortages cause people sick.  Republican local control.  Governor Desantis big government that's ideal Republican party. also illegal Florida Constitution, deem school decision local control. Approval polling predictive midterm elections guy's party benefit midterm backlash phenomenon. freedom telling people won‚Äôt get paid unless follow illegal order?   Alright, guy total asshole. Pardon French. 

What even point? Really? Aside UNMASK CHILDREN morons, could POSSIBLY helping support?

Seriously - support great banning mask mandates?

My sister lives Iowa even mask mandate ban, people masking schools too.  Nobody pays me. even post often. Models reality. year far masks stop spread covid, best slow slightly. Western country gets point masks longer necessary keep delta future greek letter control, I'll change mind. even necessarily stick needles. lot IET vaccines delivered via jet injectors, use high pressure stream liquid force vaccine arm.   think somewhere around 87% detecting positive Yea I‚Äôm disappointed CDC‚Äôs poor coordination government economists. cannot hard scientists make decisions without appreciating sociopolitical economic consequences think claim Vegan get vaccine, that's fine, anyone catches eating meat, dairy, usual ""not vegan-friendly"" categories food, fired spot severance. 

If they're going claim vegan, ass better living like vegan. See opposed vaccine means never consume anything cheese, egg, meat public ever again.

I've seen lot anti-vax people, last two weeks without cheeseburger.  sounds lot like autoimmune disease beginning kids. got mono young similar experience later diagnosed autoimmune disease. never really afterwards. Thank goodness 18 months prepare adding hospital space staff! Since idiot unvaccinated infecting vaccinated make pay. Oh wait‚Ä¶ won‚Äôt test pay. truly selfish plague ridden little rats!
Am pissed? Yes. 8 unvaccinated adults showed outdoor family reunion 7 positive children 12. knew adults vaccinated didn‚Äôt let anyone know weren‚Äôt. kids miserably sick I‚Äôm livid.  brother gone rants masks uncomfortable useless wearing full body motorcycle kevlars helmet 90 degree whether. tests available nationally. different kinds tests though, Binax ones rapid antigen tests. see expensive ones (70$+) usually PCR testing sent lab accurate (but expensive slower get results).

The Binax includes 2 sets tests that's supposed test twice (between 36 hours 3 days apart) due lowered accuracy antigen tests compared PCR, etc.  Ok, know confusing totally new information, covid spread person person masks people slows spread.  ‚ÄúAll views expressed ..‚Äù

A personal blog. Misinformation 101. hahahahahaa, dammit, smartest guy :) coronavirus impacted seasonal effects.

If look last year, notice Florida got hit around last year well.

Unless Delta manages spread fast enough, also strongly reflect seasonal behavior.

So, whatever month state took beating last year likely takes beating year unless vaccinated % high enough state makes mitigation efforts.

Florida's vaccination efforts insufficient mitigation efforts spiking. CDC reported Florida

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  quotes it‚Äôs good reason tell kids can‚Äôt come I‚Äôd rather outside lol seems privacy issue addressed requiring vaccinated persons permission check record. I'd certainly uncomfortable making state vaccination records fully public Tom, Dick, Harry hop online check vaccine neighbor got. schools already require students release certain medical information them, setting release condition continued enrollment seems reasonable. ""the inevitable""?

This wave, COVID hit unvaccinated adults hard. this, COVID becomes endemic, periodic seasonal surges concentrated amongst unvaccinated. remain unvaccinated likely contract COVID point

COVID spread quickly schools. true even vaccines approved children 12, indications [that vaccine uptake amongst kids lamentably low sadly appear political get vaccine mandates (this hopefully averted states sensible approaches). Thankfully, risks kids comparatively low (especially mortality), course still lead many bad tragic outcomes.

Eventually, people decide costs ongoing mitigation measures outweigh costs/risks COVID, view risks COVID simply another risk life. half country already here. time goes COVID become endemic, country reach place. isn‚Äôt banning people wearing masks. banning people requiring others wear masks. I‚Äôm fan Abbott mask mandate ban, though.  Totally untrue. Deaths lag cases weeks - exactly see fairly big outbreak squashed. Pretty sure Melbourne saw days deaths higher cases end big lockdown.  add Florida ? According Measles highly contagious disease caused virus, usually results high fever rash, lead blindness, encephalitis death. end 2020, 84% children received one dose measles-containing vaccine second birthday, 179 Member States included second dose part routine immunization 70% children received two doses measles vaccine according national immunization schedules.

Given fact measles MUCH contagious, 70% recieved two doses 84% recieved one dose, according saying would mean measles would still spreading across globe considering R0 value 18 compared COVID's 2/2.4. course know hard say considering we've lived measles long prior vaccines, even delta strain value double (5 more), still mean need 90% reach herd immunity.

If take novel example, Swine Flu spite hurdles, CDC estimated October 2009 May 2010, 27 percent Americans age 6 months vaccinated H1N1, including 34 percent high-priority groups.

And even low vaccination rates, pandemic already officially declared 2010. know R0 lower COVID, recent example another pandemic could find.

Obviously Swine Flu included annual flu shot, back 2010.

On top that, know we've found traces COVID-19 dating back previously thought, we've obviously living disease quite already. likely high percentage people even know they've already immune. definetly help people live crowded military quarters. would enough actually shut 6-8 weeks doctors recommended. like everything American health care 1/4 job celebrated. Loads people aren‚Äôt even money right because, again, workers largely left bailouts. 

Doing won‚Äôt work anti vax anti mask idiots wont either.

And healthcare isn‚Äôt free one gets pto loads people don‚Äôt choice spread homeless hungry. 

If it‚Äôs unclear: I‚Äôm capitalism oligarchy doses given, 32.9M fully vaccinated, 58.8% total vaccination rate.

Either way, look chart linked, looking total 121k delta cases unvaccinated patients, 28k cases *fully* vaccinated patients. 224 vaccinated deaths, 165 unvaccinated deaths. Ohhh. Haha. Wow went right head. Thanks giving help there! U.S. people ""smart"" controlled yet stupid informed Meltblown fabric 60 years old, protection efficacy spectrum (with many contributing factors), unquestionably protective.   wouldn‚Äôt surprising little better data currently showing Israel. hospitals Israel far overrun. Given would hospitalizations cautious. Hospitalizations could skew toward oldest vulnerable people, also happen vaccinated. could potentially skew efficacy hospitalizations lower reality. Population density seems factor too. Illinois 49% fully vaxxed, Florida. Florida 405 people per 1 sq. mile Illinois‚Äô 226. Obviously vax rate extremely low (Alabama), low pop density won‚Äôt help much (Alabama 97), picture seems complicated simply fully vaccinated rate. 

Personally, think take away get vaccinated don‚Äôt live crowded places, possible. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è thought talking masks second super confused. Children make 4% hospitalized due 100% preventable illness. Cool. Governor‚Äôs races aren‚Äôt affected gerrymandering. need everyone get vote turn Texas blue. Idiots first!  2018. year Democrats took house wide margin. moot point. DeSantis campaigned 2020 would much wider margin account Trump improving 2016 2020 Florida despite clobbered elsewhere. Seeing DeSantis braindead therefore fit govern, removed power yet? think process is, lie pretend said truth. That's parents do. Impressive. Let's hope trend continues. Attempts made, able convince people know (I bribed friends kickass gumbo case got side effects). I'm getting coworkers moment.  According her, first hospital discharged twice, second time could hardly move.  


If true, malpractice. good news. I'm glad this. But, reason country dived civil war intact military, worry foreign agents would use something like wedge issue drive apart military. happens, fucked.  There's pretty big population throughout American history labelled un-American left alone. Cool, gong pandemic scrapbook ;) ‚ÄúIs good! virus here! Putin stopped virus!‚Äù extremely tiref 2nd shot. Like literally knocked entire day. zero energy anything all. Thankfully took day work got shot.if need get 3rd shot I'd definitely make sure get friday work next day. leopards glad well fill face Ebola kills 50% people infected. mean say deadly enough compared something would require much larger response. Nice edit trying save face. Unvaccinated Americans driving surge here. Delta thriving many unvaccinated. 95% people hospitalized Covid unvaccinated. Free testing supports unvaccinated. believe continue, believe health insurance companies continue support it. gonna help Pretty sure hospitals testing COVID admission patients mostly sure isolate properly. definitely true beginning year. articles seeming make distinction hospital COVID treated COVID hospital. end hospital ruptured spleen appendicitis test positive COVID would show stats ""COVID patient"". R0 stays 1 pandemic eventually burns out.

I've hearing past year half.

I really know say beyond -- CDC's guidance saying vaccinated people could go without masks -- masking community close 100%, indoors (through roughly March) outdoors. yet COVID kept marching anyway Okay let‚Äôs masks forever socialize anyone? Lmfao that‚Äôs dumb, high risk people dying Covid anymore, it‚Äôs unvaccinated extremely vulnerable. It‚Äôs dumb keep wearing masks among vaccinated social distance, let people socialize live lives, covid damage social life health vaccinated. There's federal database, much be. cards, hell, printed written on. ID checks insurance checks states. could walk Walgreens, Costco, etc., today get third shot. crazy think would ecstatic florida texas right now, whole country way higher density That's fucked up. Kids get choose get vaccinated. Even 17 year old can't get vaccination without parents permission teen happens live state need it, exactly easy orchestrate everything secret parent's wishes. get vaccinated family community. referring polarizing juvenile namecalling trivial differences opinion mentioned. agreeing point true, raise risk factors serious complications. Try use reason instead throwing tantrum.  lol funny every jack jill ready call someone moron. 

I'm neuroscientist/pediatric neursurgeon. source?

The brain magical thing. way protecting low functioning people knowing dumb really are. However, things people must say leave room must pretty embarrassing. sad Yes, better safe sorry. eldest child four younger siblings grade school. get sick, whole family gets sick. Wearing mask uncomfortable point. makes feel naked wear one. Yes people still partied stuff lockdowns. government strict people still defied orders.  Jesus fucking Christ, I'm talking idiot. post responding could argue fat people refuse lose weight suffer heart attacks/strokes/diabetes consequence poor health decisions self-inflicted unvaccinated people gotten seriously ill covid.

No one talking fat people COVID.

That's illiterate.

We talking fat itself. 

Jesus fucking hell. spent time working manpower discharged LOD/PEB. Try again. Walgreens near binax take home rapid tests, 2 ~$20. insurance necessary. 

Is case nationally? Martin Luther also said [those ignore medical advice plague committing definitely children using cellular devices iPads Chromebooks. many screens, enough outside time.

This week, local state run Soccer leagues scheduled begin. currently indoor mask mandates, would bunch adults children ""none could confirm vaccinated"" make situation worse already is?

I family go play leagues, I'm worried could troublesome un-vaccinated toddlers/children.

Is evidence worth reading would put mind ease?

Thanks thought supposed let certain percentage old people die economy? mixed messages, tells ya! Thanks information, appreciate response live science link misinformation, that's bot deleted you. new link says January even though somehow twisting December. first US cases identified January 2020. UK way 50% vaccinated. May 1st, 50-54yo 83% vaccinated percentage vaccinated increase age. 65yo 90% vaccinated. 

Even though vaccines greatly reduces severity people, elderly compromised immune system still vulnerable. fact vaccinated people died unvaccinated unsurprising considering number vaccinated people greatly outnumber number unvaccinated people. 

You see action &lt;50 deaths. UK opened vaccines younger people much later opened elderly. number unvaccinated deaths greatly outnumber vaccinated deaths.  tested using one today Florida. done lab tech though, home. see point, could right it, I'm still getting jab. Good question! actually managed get Covid last October vaccines even available even though masking hand sanitizer distancing ever went work (where mask) grocery store (where mask). sick develop pneumonia one lung treated steroids antibiotics rest got it. immune system doesn‚Äôt under-react - overreacts. anything meant intentionally trigger immune response (like vaccine) could cause damage. last vaccine got resulted body attacking spine paralysis fun gotta say. Covid sucked. Transverse myelitis sucks worse. think lot policymakers confident new administration got vaccines rolling, effectively over. vaxxed vaxxed avoidant generally lived apart enough population clusters safe huge breakouts. jumped take hard anti-precaution stances electoral brownie points, confident matter lifetime (or least term). Covid gone, political capital gained. Everyone happy.

Then delta rolls proves virulent enough start hitting vaccine-avoidant regardless bar woods rock. they're stuck stance voter base cannibalize try wrangle thing.  tell never military beyond maybe quick junior enlisted stint know talking about.

e: vv yeah quick junior enlisted stint lot people saying won‚Äôt go similar bullshit  sensible French. Bless them. mother took son hospital says turned away unvaccinated. took 2nd hospital intubated immediately. irony covid vaccines among tested vaccines market many Americans received scrupulously watched. vast majority side effects vaccine occur within first three months well past extreme number Americans. brilliant analysis 250k alot people mean country 67m nothing get mean. large number would still fall minority category.   test every child comes broken arm? count towards number? think they‚Äôre referring states. It‚Äôs free anyone US since beginning pandemic helps effective island. 

I sure coronavirus arrived North America via airports, across land borders. sense, North America effectively island, too. even get started idiots , sometimes point statistically kids likely fall victim family member friends Bill Gates Clinton , delete posts others block lol

#savethechildren dumbass parents That, higher rate vaccination. think they're focused newest named variant (from mid-June), even Variant Concern. We'll probably hear lot every new named variant. emergency 18 months pandemic safe effective vaccine exists. 

Ding, ding ding!!! Yup, biontech vaccine üòÄ said supposed free? UK citizens paying pretty big fee, last heard, quarantine proof etc. point properly masking best best possible scenario considering people talking previous comment. Yep. There‚Äôs lots bad people. 

Especially could fixed early didn‚Äôt wanna. Essentially stock market that‚Äôs used barometer it‚Äôs gross. country unity, follow rules. follow traffic rules, follow laws, knowing endanger fellow Americans. known responsible.

They're group people knowingly spreading lies vaccines. They're also people spreading lies rights freedoms.

Mask mandates vaccine mandates impose rights freedoms. civic cost participating advanced society. Schools vaccine mandates, militaries it, hospitals it. They've mandates years know that's keep people safe.

Division keeps pandemic going. everyone could get shot did, pandemic might already could go back regular lives.

The primary reason people getting shot uninformed selfishness.  *Covid accomplices.   Good luck even able submit appeal NCO. Also, unless discrimination protected class (there wouldn‚Äôt be) shredder time. asymptomatic breakthrough cases possible? Wondering would even possible track this. reason care due reports COVID may result neurological cases even among exhibit mild symptoms asymptomatic. may fully vaccinated still want catch thing! he‚Äôs talking ‚Äòthe economy needs reopened even kills vulnerable‚Äô crowd, fear lost cause Sure. hate it.   know else matter opposition laughs putting effort? iPhones. iPhones get laughed at, may ask? They're outdated, overpriced, immoral/evil, defect unreliable, easily damaged, unenjoyable, every way useless, etcetera etcetera. 
 could go longer want make fun promote company openly performs malicious scams mlm schemes get dumbass 12 year olds buy shitty phone. looks like it‚Äôs quickly going viral. I‚Äôm curious see studies he‚Äôs referencing. folk say ‚ÄúVaccine untested‚Äù, millions people tested pretty far off, thought same.. Maryland Baltimore city far lowest vaccination rates. assure populated ""patriots"" either, suspect way alot places.  us like sir sandwiches.

It particularly sounds awful addressing ladies. believe actually may due spending much time inside general, would tend include reading screens. Firstly, exposure sunlight seems impact eye development. Secondly, things inside don‚Äôt tend distance, also thought impact development ability focus distant objects. Rapid tests? Florida may middle pack terms vaccination rates, states trailing somewhat protected things like huge tourism scene (most usually kind encourage huge gatherings people way say, Orlando does). Add state tried save tourism based economy pushing hard ""Covid over, come fun"" people happy come maskless holiday. basically Florida middle pack dealing problems frontrunner. interesting see comes Autumn: one hand general increase disease see people shift school year mode (increased time indoors, kids passing around things school) working FL also winding tourism season reduces impact out-of-state cases. 

Being fully personal opinion, DeSantis pounce slightest dip cases declare again. He's staked much brand Covid nothing. we're clear, within 28 days, Delta variant, England, Feb 1 July 19th, 224 fully vaccinated patients died 165 unvaccinated patients died. Someone remembers ""Don't Mess Texas"" originally meant! work ex-military guy says ""They stuck many needles who-knows-what trust shots anymore""

Which sounds like weapons grade ""whoosh"" best, there's chance anything say change mind, sigh move on. Sad, hope someone actually trying mobilize people get vaccinated Could said; work, need save healthcare workers? 
  
Or think lie people prevent run masks bad toilet paper? don‚Äôt blame you. vaccine became available people ended hazard pay. coworkers know vaccinated, already short staffed bills pay, show up, sick not.  It‚Äôs vax vs anti-Vax, it‚Äôs people acting responsible pandemic. yes, vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean responsible. need vaccinate practice social distancing masks avoiding crowded events responsible present moment. Pointless arguing Chinese shills. go his/her post history. Anti HK, anti Japan, anti Taiwan pro China. That's basically entire reddit history. posts brings droves. IPCC releases new climate report. Given response COVID, report two words. **We fucked!** not? 

Reminds particularly narcissistic man dated left. gall ask didn‚Äôt feel *sorry* him. could heartless?

Both examples classic blame shifting used narcissists; trying make victim assume responsibility problem solution.   said another theory ‚Äúthe immune system somehow gets deranged it‚Äôs hard shut down,‚Äù residual virus genetic fragments keep immune responses activated.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like song gone, music lingers on,‚Äù said.

‚ÄòWe don‚Äôt sort magic treatment‚Äô
Nearly 4.2 million young people United States Covid-19, according American Academy Pediatrics. Relatively small percentages hospitalized initial infections developed condition called Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome Children (MIS-C) emerge several weeks later. Doctors expect considerably experience long Covid.

At Boston Children‚Äôs Hospital, program draws long Covid patients across country, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre seeing things like fatigue, headaches, brain fog, memory concentration difficulties, sleep disturbances, ongoing change smell taste,‚Äù said Dr. Molly Wilson-Murphy, neuroinfectious diseases specialist there. said patients ‚Äúkids Covid weren‚Äôt hospitalized, recovered home, symptoms never go away ‚Äî seem get totally better couple weeks month after, develop symptoms.‚Äù

Dr. Amanda Morrow, co-director pediatric post-Covid-19 clinic Kennedy Krieger Institute Baltimore, said getting treatment early might help recovery. Post-Covid clinics find need multiple specialists approaches including exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy, sleep modification medication issues respiratory gastrointestinal problems.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt yet sort good predictors affected, much they‚Äôll affected quickly they‚Äôll recover,‚Äù Dr. Wilson-Murphy said, adding ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt sort magic treatment.‚Äù

Much long Covid remains mysterious. symptoms resemble aftereffects concussions brain injuries. Some, like post-exertional malaise ‚Äî physical mental exertion increases exhaustion ‚Äî echo symptoms chronic fatigue syndrome, experts say.

Some patients develop  Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, POTS, involves lightheadedness racing heart rates upon standing up.

Some studies report higher proportions older children long-term issues. might adolescents find symptoms disruptive puberty, hormones might amplify immune responses, Dr. Nath said.

An April study United Kingdom‚Äôs Office National Statistics found 9.8 percent 2-to-11-year-olds 13 percent 12-to-16-year-olds infected coronavirus reported continuing symptoms five weeks later. 12 weeks, rates remained significant: 7.4 percent younger group 8.2 percent older group.

In another U.K. study, 4.4 percent 1,734 children symptoms four weeks post-Covid, four times high percentage symptoms four weeks non-Covid illnesses like flu. 2 percent Covid patients symptoms eight weeks.

Also sad don‚Äôt cherish ones equipped helping us move forward saving lives. disrespect level high fuckery. Classic district admin position lol Good parents! would like see charged genocide well. Comments like silly typically made people refuse accept good news. New vaccinations good, that‚Äôs lot vaccinations. New case numbers aren‚Äôt going stay levels forever, every vaccine helps. Thanks hoss. local hospital ICU diversion. Thank you!! Almost every person I‚Äôve known read breakthru infection (including person above) feeling better within couple days. Typical Covid infection duration short. Everyone family felt like shit least two weeks, wasn‚Äôt back 100% almost 2 months. Totally you. tough, easy solution.  one saw coming right? literally excepted positions. public health experts. 
We require vaccines go college, nothing new happening here. 
I'm required sorts vaccines job. 
At point get vaccinated allowed work. exemption health related. Yup actually think themselves. Keep home can, know hard probably best.  U A! U A!  [a little that. Nurses not. required get many many vaccines even actually become nurses. Thanks clarification. removed term *conservatives*. However, still fact whites vaccinated much higher rate blacks %-wise based data shown [Figure 3 shows actual numbers. referenced data garnered survey I'm sure statistically significant.

I guess known would turn ideological war instead call action get people vaccinated. Excellent point. Oh dear! That‚Äôs case long time. don‚Äôt necessarily need herd immunity though live virus. unvaxxed last first hospitals reach capacity. 

Better yet, set separate unvaxxed covid capacity. hospital 100 beds, 40 reserved unvaxxed covid. 40 full, ‚Äútoo bad, hospital‚Äôs full, go somewhere else‚Äù even remaining 60 empty.   exceptions apply. They're....what? that's it. Lack empathy fuel virus needs win. less empathy likely fall victim. Seriously, got shot thought might get seriously sick stand idea inaction could start chain ending needless pain death utter strangers.

It's simple thing. I'm really saint. struck responsible course action.

Okay, give blood. really I'm otherwise normal. antivaxxer people psychopaths. Vegan vaccinated here. Using strength makes sense. Thanks sharing perspective. won‚Äôt happen. can‚Äôt even mask mandates schools here. I‚Äôm glad mine old enough vaccinate. Colorado ended qualified immunity last year, first state so. There‚Äôs belief locally Denver police playing victim ever since actively nothing stop surge property crimes street racing retribution. Devil‚Äôs Advocate here, little bit perhaps. agreed examples read could help think example ‚Äúthe patient endangered themselves‚Äù - stark difference people choosing open Covid infection become danger many people - like drunk behind wheel car, analogy.

While doctor‚Äôs prerogative segregate punish sociopathic simply dim-witted disease carriers, society take harsh dim view them.

This, think, anger people expressing. still selfish regardless transmissibility unvaccinated people make 95% COVID hospital admissions. taking beds resources patients need non-COVID related purposes.    Peoples wanted live still vaccinated nobody give single fuck. Isn‚Äôt fact vaccinated get infected show symptoms bad terms spreading virus? Since won‚Äôt know spread opposed symptom two staying home?  Along teachers, like me, pregnant woman mom battling breast cancer. vaccinated, choice caution lose job. Yeah, remember hearing story thinking, ‚ÄúNina Totenberg, high?‚Äù Church. Well covid joke adults figured responsibility, serious kill hundreds thousands millions thus get vaccine idiot. 
Sorry loss I'm glad take covid kinda seriously church least there's much people still gathering.  would anybody make absurd claim? It‚Äôs binary solution whereby either hit herd immunity don‚Äôt. people antibodies, slower spread lower peaks. Vaccines still endgame majority population. Children 12 approved two stages (5-11 first, 6mo-5 mo) vaccination Octoberish, greatly increase percentage population vaccinated. Breakthrough infections unfortunate individual level, driving wave infections hospitalizations. 

Anti-vaxxers continue get sick waves necessitating temporary societal restrictions take strain ICU capacity. peaks become less severe fewer fewer hosts available. vulnerable need continue isolate enough people develop antibodies via vaccination infection. lucky. :/ 

The length time take get depend many people get vaccinated quickly delta subsequent variants rip unvaccinated. 

A transmissible, less deadly variant could emerge, far Covid significant selective pressure placed become less deadly. Since Covid hosts tend dying well contagious, doesn‚Äôt matter evolutionarily kills .1%, 1% 10% hosts. could get lucky end less deadly dominant variant, could get worse.

Vaccines, masks public spaces, temporary regional/national restrictions public gatherings heavily affected areas. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs we‚Äôve got public health standpoint.

Convince everyone know get vaccinated. Nope. let's let anti-maskers keep pretending fabricated sense control worth it. Iowa soon bunch. governor ban mask mandates. hate here. one part God told look stick snake wrapped around it, didnt, died.

i feel like vaccine equivalent snake wrapped around stick. rather dubious honor, say? 80/20 rule statistics frequent safe assuming it, heh.  I‚Äôm teacher start soon. Kids aren‚Äôt mandated wear masks, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, vaccinated since March. wear KN95 mask cloth mask top, safe outbreak occurs? toddler home want prevent bringing Covid home. Looking advice steps take so! Thank you!

ETA: I‚Äôll keeping windows open much possible, two small windows, sure much ventilation occur. Also, live heavily Republican area adamant 99% survival rate masks aren‚Äôt helpful. Ah yes exactly drive kids places intentionally take vaccine that's available wear mask that's available spite. something like unforgivable disease ‚Äò‚Äôunclear‚Äô‚Äô extreme caution exercised it‚Äôs given clear. hate seem taking precautionary measures instead wait worst happen. Keep goddamn mask mandates place robust data serious kids vaccinated  Why? Stupids get dictate credible science. That's stupids. Why? say so! why, vegan, think exception first place. Getting vaccinated vegan, harm-reducing, choice think might patients, obviously, keep forgetting rules social distance, masking up, washing hands,‚Ä¶

Parents preschoolers looong school year ahead. also important note natural infection, immune system develop antibody **any** part virus infected you. immune system lack better way put essnetially dices thing serves pieces immune system play molecular dice finds match becomes antibody body starts making. process perfect, one solution problem immune system cranking out. combine fact discovered spike protein virus uses invade cells hold shape separated viral envelope, decreased chance body making antibody specifically that. mean going antibodies combat virus, one reduced likelihood it. Anyways, modified RNA spike protein mRNA vaccines hold shape built, immune system form antibody explicitly it. Since delta variant's main advantage ton spike proteins surface stands reason (and numbers backing up) making antibody spike protein confers serious advantage severe infection. vaccine ensures making advantageous antibody. districts offering virtual option without funding. Abbott everything make worse. Fucking hell. can't believe anyone surprised this. 

Your talking people suddenly developed health issues supposed get masking. 

Then vaccinated allowed gather mask public lied too. 

Anyone thinks would hesitate lying lifestyle claim means vaccinate paying attention. 

The interesting point come fails deny closely held Christian beliefs claim religion protects getting jab. 

That informative. Whole numbers really matter though. could probably say California unvaccinated people Mississippi whole numbers. sovereign cannot sued without consent. We‚Äôre also closing US death toll 1918 flu pandemic (675k). entered summer, figured pandemic fading wouldn‚Äôt surpass that. Now, even though we‚Äôre still 50k shy, I‚Äôll surprised don‚Äôt. lol

[‚ÄúWhile see durable Phase 3 efficacy 6 months, expect neutralizing titers continue wane eventually impact vaccine efficacy. Given intersection, believe dose 3 booster likely necessary prior winter season,‚Äù Moderna phase 3 efficacy means efficacy same. suppose could say even though neutralizing titers waning, it‚Äôs affecting infection rates. Perhaps redundant number immediately vaccination. again, I‚Äôm scientist, don‚Äôt even know neutralizing titers are.   great watch  mean government done differently? voted JRB - CDC continues fail.

That‚Äôs calculation works. 80% deaths unvaccinated That's true. Yeah delta contagius, vaccines effective vaccines we've ever developed. Usually vaccines 60-70% effectivie _at best_.

While may look bad surface consider things. Since January, 229 deaths vaccinated people, however total 9504 breakthrough cases meaning deaths represent less 1% total breakthrough cases (not 1% vaccinated people, 1% breakthrough cases). still unfortunate, 89% deaths people age 65, good reason look potential boosters age range (several countries already this).

While couldn‚Äôt find total cases since January, April saw 7 day average 7k per day, meaning 1.5 days April saw total cases total amount breakthrough cases since JANUARY. I‚Äôm assuming take total January- present numbers, breakthrough cases represent less 1% total cases.

Obviously people get vaccinated vaccine isn‚Äôt 100% effective, going see vaccinated people test positive, get hospitalized, die. said, vaccinated FAR LESS LIKELY unvaccinated people end categories. texas terrible

Thank that‚ù§ COVID not, kids gonna fall sick lot start daycare. 15 month old started daycare turned 1. never fallen ill first year home whole time. fell sick 3-4 times first 2 months, colds one time RSV infection bit worse cold. still comes back cold every couple weeks. daycare works, build immunity. Look way:

What happens complete course antibiotics? 

The bacteria survived either already slightly fit, better adapted holding back effects antibiotic taking short duration, surviving bacteria actively adapted survive. Either way, harder kill bacteria. simplified view antibiotic resistance.

We same, IMO, vaccines provide sterilizing immunity allowing even vaccinated people wear masks. inadvertently selecting fitter, robust strains SARS COV2. 

It's matter ""I got muh vaccine, *I'm protected* "" - matter viral ""monster"" accidentally creating lax masking vaccines stop weaker strains? Yeah. feel privileged able keep 18-month old daycare he's vaccinated. may able wear mask then, trust room 2 year olds wear masks well enough matter. like plague version people Houston (where am) traveled Galveston 1900 *watch hurricane*. one thing right thing, quite another move clear across country it. ""Find city fewest masks greatest shortage nursing staff vaccines *that's* new home!"" ""i'm parent"" could stopped there. shame they're already born nobody give shit lives. US NUMBER 1!!! No, genius governor actually forbade schools mandating masks. It‚Äôs clear even Western systems, times emergency necessitate loss freedoms. nothing new, happened times war, pandemics, etc. important part also vigilant regaining freedoms events over. Even pirates older days immediately followed authoritarian military structures they‚Äôd follow orders captain they‚Äôre battle.

What fucked things like Patriot act loss freedoms lifted endless war terror people lost trust extremely skeptical politicians try declare emergencies. problem bad leadership, corruption, misinformation, problem freedom not. use parachute example say get on/jump plane. Seriously. either refuse seriously cannot think outside exact current situation enough think might one day ""be plane"" need ""parachute"" take precautions pandemic even currently see people dropping dead directly front you. 

These people spend whole lives believing ""that's never going happen"". They're never going get sick, never going loose jobs, never going racial religious minority, never gay family member, nothing ever big deal... happens flip around become r/selfawarewolves material wear masks indoors shopping since businesses area requiring employees mask wanna respectful. Trump could stopped single handedly gets blame Biden single person can't stop it. Biden can't produce results efforts worth? U-S-‚Ä¶‚Ä¶A? America always #1! Oh gosh! 50 positives! terrible! many hospitalizations?!

Ya, that's thought. missing part story ... way north 90% (of USA population) MMR vaccine. barely/hopefully 50% COVID vaccine. Delta may high R0 number, pool possible patients much larger Measles ... least moment.

CDC says One dose MMR vaccine 93% effective measles, 78% effective mumps, 97% effective Two doses MMR vaccine 97% effective measles 88% effective mumps.

[This gives MMR vaccination rates state. Massachusetts highest, Missouri lowest. states allow child attend school without MMR vaccination.

So wall Measles much stronger wall COVID. completely loss, feel paralyzed, professional musician dream since least 4 years old, it‚Äôs core part identity, close living, traveling gigging lot lately, bout go Cincinnati Chicago feel it‚Äôll likely last time tour. autism music special interest neurodivergent it‚Äôs incredibly hard keep employment, either fuck end getting taken advantage straight bullied coworkers, Every ‚Äúnormal‚Äù job ever hated burning passion made depressed hopeless. past week scrolling indeed knot anxiety stomach, inner strength apply even one job deep know I‚Äôll hate it.

Exactly, people cheer restrictions event cancellations honestly sickening. govt final say hospitalizations deaths go control. individual risk assessment impact general population. former vegan insane people 'outside' paint vegans zealous bigots common sense. wanting cause pain suffering animals fucking radical idea.

I mean definitely exist they're outliers. Yup, can't wait people wake up, stop brain washed afraid, go live life. dad lives Florida. Late last week learned hard issues may require surgery. typically patient situation would sent home awaiting testing, doctor said, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt promise there‚Äôll bed available Monday COVID. want admit tests inpatient bed can‚Äôt turn away.‚Äù

On top that, best hospital condition longer accepting new patients due COVID. wait two days transfer, doctor told would impossible get non-transfer point.

Sandy Hook pretty much drew line much country cares children.

Seat belts help allowed risk lives others using seatbelts. People refuse vaccination thing. killing others ""personal"" decision. 

We require use seat belts protect public health.

We require childhood vaccines protect public health.

We require Covid vaccines protect public health. That's I've telling people (that listen), basically last year flu RSV went away due masking distancing/lock downs, etc. Covid wants host ravage left RSV probably next place it'll mutate take advantage (this pediatrician used work believes coming) lot people getting ready send kids back willy nilly. I'm happy son 14 vaccinated, he'll wearing mask school, mandated not. figure it‚Äôs better safe sorry, wife recently collapsed lung doc screwed nerve block w needle last thing needed breakthrough case covid (she got Pfizer March). ‚ÄúGiven mortality rates observed far‚Äù account delta/delta+ variant another mutation due 70 million children refusing vaccine. point many people peachy idea it‚Äôs serious. attitude 10,000 deaths ‚Äúassumed‚Äù would control yet today 600,000+ deaths. graves school grounds proven fact. 

The fake treatments given black men syphilis proven fact. 

The stories turned factual... know moma right.

Poor fragile people charge.  pigeon's coming home roost. sulphur attached still ends 1 percent people got sick die. unvaccinated US anyway. wonder why? would expected less deaths percentage people contracting it. $15 crap, making $17/hr part time stock clerk Publix 2002. Jesus, live.
My local government even going far stop testing unless sever manitory isolation sick.
Fucking insane. really unfair characterization. I'm vegan know quite others. first line vaccines. Veganism harm reduction, goes fellow humans, too.

Anyone says vegan also anti-vaxx probably practicing sick version veganism subscribe ""purity"" crap. People ethical vegans environmental reasons, etc. typically claim people own. 

Please know like this, ""pushy."" me, you. would surprised. radical vegans would likely perspective. worked one NIH cancer research institutes - research really serious illness, primarily using mice, behind huge number developments made cancer survivable. part training learned idiot extremist tried break ‚Äòfree mice‚Äô. Apparently happens every then. Never mind can‚Äôt cancer research without them, much bigger part training everyone gets mice need treated super well, mice would die 30 hot seconds wild idea survive. Every major medicine available (including stuff given pets) gone testing process. Never mind people‚Äòs entire research (mine included) based around bioinformatics decrease use animal life reasonably possible.

No, idiots one track mind. fully believe idiots would refuse get vaccinated. said, happened suuuper rarely cancer research lab, every years. can't kids wearing masks else can't breathe!!!

Since kids can't get vaccinated, need wear masks. Protect kids stop turning lab experiment. Science denial has, unfortunately, permeating society quite time. Carl Sagan spoke book ""**The Demon-Haunted World: Science Candle Dark""** released 1997; great read. Georgia‚Äôs R value also starting go down, school also started we‚Äôll wait see happens. I'm Canada.  heard experiments syphilis well covid. part vaccine hesitancy discussion. 

When group mistreated, poor men syphilis 'treatment' group mistreated, becomes story group narrative. 

We bad things black people.  made distrustful medicine.  want trust us us going die get vaccinated too. 

Yeah, quite hurdle overcome.  

I say we, look white pass easily.  members family pass. 

I get vaccine hesitancy issue black communities.

It's bs. lot people going die part bs still covered instead acknowledged atoned fully vaccinated rate age 65 Exactly!

In areas, vast majority people 75 older vaccinated. many areas majority people 35 not. breakthrough infection far likely occur elderly person. also knew early data 1/3 people 80 didn‚Äôt produce substantial antibodies 2 doses fight earlier variants. Delta, likely worse.

Never believe anti-maskers completely unaware absurdity replies. know remarks frivolous, open challenge. amusing themselves, adversary obliged use words responsibly, since believes words. anti-maskers right play. even like play discourse for, giving ridiculous reasons, discredit seriousness interlocutors. delight acting bad faith, since seek persuade sound argument intimidate disconcert. expand PCR (polymerase chain reaction) actually reads DNA identify virus, opposed looking things body makes fight virus (which less specific) looking proteins make parts virus (also less specific).   It‚Äôs like chose read hear actually said favor whatever wanted Olympics over, stop trying collect golds already guys   let them.

Non compliance happens send message tolerated. Right safe assume is. think Delta accounts ~95% current covid cases US.  provided plenty. ignored like uneducated morons love do. wonderful one, let wife know help learn google meets better go back lock down.  Ah yes hive mind. Def something engage all. 

You provided legit counter arguments got exposed. Take care‚Äî news abuzz reports current surge US affecting children previous surges.

The CDC tracking closely makes information CDC also tracking vaccine breakthroughs data news. far data indicate either significant problem, certainly nearly degree news making be. Governments told coming decades. could planned it. Depending live, school actually fully implements masks teachers make students wear correctly, things rather okay. spaced much possible last year, fully masked, windows open, testing required contact traced. Zero student hospitalizations, zero parent deaths, one teacher school contracted Covid school year. 

The cafe opinion huge issue. good amount students contract Covid, can‚Äôt help point finger 200+ people unmasked room 30 mins exactly it. vaccinated people dumb antivaxxers coin flip decision landed right side debate. Way many vaccinated individuals feel entitled longer wearing masks got vaccinated fail understand still need masks Living one right now... get covid test exposure nurse literally went pale gasped read blood pressure.

No covid I've got follow-up today find fucked am, feel completely fine apparently fine Yeah. That‚Äôs ended happening anyways. could also told us healthy lifestyle diet good way get sick die. They‚Äôve made many missteps‚Ä¶. put goalposts wheels years ago Dr. Fauci claimed beginning masks effective people incapable absorbing new information science evolves. COVID, we're bascially dealing people use seatbelt, obey traffic laws even drive sober.  W mocked preoccupied pandemic preparedness. would lot better off. 


Also, ICU beds gone deregulation. International travel also less pervasive, would spread less quickly. Choose hate something anyway. recipe happiness, say, suit yourself! I'd accept New Zealand-like policy heartbeat instead shitshow here, BS insane rules. kiwi I'd go protesting government opens borders eases entry restrictions. Vaccines not, much better here. Lol US masking, ya that‚Äôs still debated. believe work 1,5 years pandemic probably never convinced work, honestly waste energy trying convince people point. Cleaning help viruses spreading addition covid though. Best wear masks clean lower risk triple whammy covid, rsv, flu.  Why? would directly support weve saying

Ineffective vaccines main driving force behind mutations covid, virus adapts antibiotics failed kill it. something happen natural immunity anywhere near rate

Had vaccine developed properly tested jnstead rushed span year would sick kids Lol that‚Äôs works. Agreed No, last thing want create confrontation. confrontation, driver told call dispatch calls police.

We‚Äôve tracking mask mandate violators since February. It‚Äôs around 8% people board violate mandate. Oh gosh. That‚Äôs terrible unfair people got vaccinated earlier get bonuses shot, positive incentives usually appealing negative incentives. goal get many people vaccinated possible, cheaper give airpods caring people hospital get sick. USA insist getting gold medal *everything* antiMa parents Halloween?



Do tell poor kids can't wear mask, sounds un-American. 14 days? Better month expiring. Good bye Can‚Äôt wait whole generation disabled kids people blame somehow even ones protecting them. Brain, heart, lungs, circulation... covid mess much stuff. sucks much.  Yeah someone actually fought real Taliban, they're nothing like real Taliban suggest glosses atrocities commit. 

I get trying edgy 15 year old, completely incorrect. hope right doctors work wrong.  Tomorrow students Cali start. Vaccines mandatory attend. 12 unvaccinated protected mask. hope give one earbud first shot, 2nd one come back 2nd shot. Hopefully pissed parents remember vote.  believe so? couple inside rides, queues tightly packed there‚Äôs really telling. actually check sub. got someone state subreddit claimed vaccinated caused variants 

They sub #2 visited  think said they'd climb specifically North.  never said something ignore.

I said comparing *cases* per 100,000 vaccinated people today *cases* per 100,000 last year bad comparison.

Last year, one common outcome death another hospitalization. year--if chose vaccinated--death common outcome all. Neither hospitalization. 

Obviously want breakthrough infection. also want actual flu (not things people call flu, actual influenza). really sick miserable. can--from either--suffer effects last weeks months past infection.

But (again) people evaluate risk things. people, taking risk getting sick worth all. others, might be. think crazy position take all.

I'm saying lick door knobs. saying ignore CDC masking recommendations--we follow them. saying that, depending health, health people live with, important happiness, risks might worth taking. example, *love* restaurants. indoor dining 16 months favorite places patio. think crazy occasional dine in. risk, personally worth me. every day even every week, though.

This ""out there"" position. harm reduction approach advocated experts like [Monica picked COVID outdoors correct? You‚Äôre right shut society wear masks forever minute risk. logical  see fail stupid antivaxxers order hide failed ideology. Even raging vegans hates them.

Now antivaxxers need find way mess everyone... Maybe terrorist? already causing terror comunity actions. school hasnt started places. fucked.  do, unfortunately, person I've discovered whole, strange underground vegan, ""Buddhist"", anti-vax, Trump 2024 folks. strange dissonance. fucking infuriating antivaxxers tarnish movement, pro-choice vegan, stupid conspiracies.

Vegans care animals, including humans. talk trauma slaughterhouse laborers experience get damn vaccine.  want reply's, reply's. downvotes response incorrect yet confidence someone actually knows they're talking about.

The data shows booster increase efficacy. binary 100% protected 0% protected. Data shows two doses effective, third dose likely increases efficacy. rationale? Something akin angry drunk drivers hundred children die year them? 

Do lack empathy want prove point? fearmongering trying protect child best feeling helpless? get this. huh weird, mind immediately expected happen now. Like sudden thunderclap thoughts says ""Oh yeah, shit, forgot that."" prefer learning dying.
Anytime, pretty big deal.
Another thing, can't learn dead. Teachers riot asked hybrid again. wanted beginning thought best lot bad options, became pretty clear going mess early on. January (during worst pandemic) Principal school begging students come back classroom regular basis. worried sick many student's mental emotional health. finally started trickle towards spring, things got better school (my students overall better came classroom) collective consciousness teachers went ""We cannot again, teaching twice hard half progress."" saw assessments gave students really struggled concentrate digital quizzes making silly mistakes would rarely see paper. managed get went therapy every week. Teacher burnout sky-high. Last year ""keep teachers safe."" year, needs ""keep teachers sane"" (especially since us vaccinated now). 37 times likely die motor vehicle accident die COVID.

What ever living FUCK talking about? 36,560 people **in entire United States** died car accidents 2018 (the recent year national numbers for). 700,000 people died COVID US first 12 months pandemic. 

And 1,083 people died car accidents Michigan 2020, highest number decade state. 

Next time read something Facebook, maybe Google verify repeating fact. 

Here, hard work Misinformation know fact stops working 6 months? got two doses Pfizer June straight answers long I‚Äôm protected I‚Äôm protected delta variant. know there‚Äôs breakthrough cases rare rare delta? **significant** mitigation measures. think it'd impossible understate social, financial cultural impacts past year half, find lot discussions taken granted. Influenza kills 300-650k people per year really mask, shut regional/international travel, social distance comes workplace culture go work sick. fucked going be, I‚Äôm going keep kids school vaccine available ages. damn risky Yeah friend whos overweight, J&amp;J, getting one soon case  Given mortality rates observed far, basically statistical impossibility see kids dying 10,000 100,000's. say take covid kids seriously. function fraction population vaccinated effectiveness vaccine.

In US right now, half population fully vaccinated, math fairly easy. give kid Duolingo app supplement class? Base level free there‚Äôs ton kids level online resources fill gaps.
My niece picked conversational French reading near grade level surprisingly fast. know right! like crazy force people drink drive! way eat inside restaurant. Insane. used really easy replicate. make fake license poster board stick-on letters, right color photo background, Polaroid camera, card laminating kit, pair scissors, heard. holograms watermarks make lot complicated.  mean 50 times removed? understand this: Pfizer &amp; Co vaccines gotten emergency authorization early Dec 2020, trials run younger age groups ran immediately?

Sure, trials cost money I'd argue Gov paid them, appearances, government health authorities world taking totally passive position waiting companies run trials apply authorizations, etc...  amount black family members friends avoiding vax mind boggling I'd rather kid held back, summer school, drop get GED later either die, lifelong complications Covid, bring home immune-compromised mother.

There's ways get education. There's 1 life, tough enough without lifelong health issues. severely underestimating sick covid makes you. public health people say ""mild"", mean ""doesn't need constantly monitored reliably kept alive."" Mild infections still going sickest people ever life. Breakthrough infections milder, still reliably knocking 1 2 weeks. Covid+flu vaccines happening bare minimum, we're probably going 6 month boosters unless data takes u-turn way (say make delta+beta specific boosters, historically faced kind decisions take boosters often). can't wait people say ""I fine without it, I'm taking it.""

I overheard someone work talking flu vaccine took 7 years approved. they're willing wear masks 7 years.   learned school won‚Äôt offering remote classes fall. I‚Äôm looking online public school options.  hallucinate parts one said?  Type 1 thought virus instigated. Lots viruses leave diseases behind long term effects. lost part vision chicken pox, lose part hearing swine flu (more common you‚Äôd think!) 

Type 1 often shows children. taught elementary school grades 2-6 common diabetes show otherwise would think pretty healthy kids definitely overweight poor eaters. fact, it‚Äôs skinniest kids I‚Äôve end getting it. 

A doctor one kids explained staff bad bout seasonal flu student could‚Äôve triggering factor really impressed upon us importance getting flu shots. Don‚Äôt fuck viruses. Justice delayed justice denied. MLK maybe.

Courts clogged f irs hamstrung. even talking total casualty numbers survive long term issues. Yeah. God knows too.   super ironic people dig (not covid, everything), ushering inevitability authoritarianism. fools. Child 80's. got Chicken Pox. Years later, Katrina losing damn near everything, trying rebuild Nola, getting new job, living FEMA trailer, getting back college, buying house... got Shingles 25. permanent nerve damage live life pain killers stemcell therapy becomes thing.

Fully vaxxed April. week went without mask sometime June. wear every time go out. prevention steps never stopped. work retail never positive test brought home. I'll continue everything power keep getting bringing home. I'm confused: DeSantis allowing private businesses run business see fit? Now, parents family members bring COVID back to...

That aside, fucking *irony* turning vaccination ""we know side effects"" already know enough consequences ""long COVID"" understand worse whatever vaccine might do. Years now, could finding getting COVID single digits gives high likelihood sterility, asthma, kind learning disability; antivaxx parents proud then? find something else blame on?  Old white guys rural areas likely vaccinated, less likely travelled travelers rural areas first round, they're likely 'covid gubbamint bullshevik' crowd, that's 'old white guy pickup' sums up. 

See: Louisiana

There tautologies, broad strokes always unwarranted. ""OK, take potato severance package compliments. go home"" maybe try trusting black medical social leaders also saying take vaccine. good mandate there‚Äôs always certain kids need reminded every 3 minutes supposed wear mask properly?  

I‚Äôm sighing pretty hard send kid back school person days.  literally someone tell wish covid quickly infected everyone rather taking vaccine, works product quality testing ""he knows"" things go wrong production. half people vaccinated. Current active cases December rocket ship slope increasing atm. Thankfully fatalities 20% December. vaccine we'd probably next winter up. remember CDC putting chart last year saying would million deaths let virus run wild take precautionary measures (no masks, vaccines, etc.).

 Well, we're way anyway.  think people sick bad news Yeah like, ‚Äúsit minutes feel fine leave‚Äù me. 

But feel Yeah, depends. variants higher lethality variety reasons unlikely recombine delta mere infectious. said, evidence suggest simply infectious increases lethality somewhat, since infectious variants ones become dominant (that's genetic pressure is) one could infer super infectious therefore deadly version virus could pop up. said, new media also need dial things keep people watching. However, supposition without historical precedent. might alarmist, also might come true. Sadly enough that's probably gunning long run. kids stay home less funds public education. Public Teachers unions one pillars Democratic party. makes feel better, vaccinations climbing rapidly well. Exactly, actually seem give shit citizens. trust USA. grew south spent time living California moved back. One first things struck getting back many obese people comparison. Place work 10 people got work right Covid. know outbreak lot complains mask vaccine. welllll shit ""Free"" less available due health services/facilities transportation lacking black areas. also experienced this. Much earlier pandemic, people town local news page telling covid affect children all. said possibly know since virus around long enough gauge whether true dismissed irrational.  put much effort thought.  520/75,000,000..wont someone think children! Yes. It‚Äôs disgusting. sad thing could prevented. right that. Healthcare professionals reporting delta strain, people expiring much quickly OG strain. patient might ICU weeks before, lot cases, days. follows beds turning fairly quickly.    Wrong. 520 died number rising Covid cases among children jumped 84% last week. Hospitalizations increased well. wait school back session. numbers surely rise even dramatically. 

So, seriously now, many kids going die give shit?  moved Europe 5 years ago amazed thin fit people here.

I heard horror stories Americans big I've still never seen person. what‚Äôs heart breaking. People fucking suck. They‚Äôre dumb. school system public officials failed. self-righteousness words troubling.

No offense intended here, coming way speak entire race people, say take care them, statistics seem show nobody taking care subject. 

And third party entire argument, think right. Judging entire race people knows ridiculous. many, many people refer Tuskegee experiments justification trusting doctors (though many know much them, even mix Tuskegee Airmen), many others distrusting reasons entirely know least care troubling history African-American medical care. 

There's reason two taking opposite sides justifications hold value figuring tens millions people's actions!

And frankly, likely part community, human one...because virus care color are. won‚Äôt mentally financially survive another lockdown.

I wonder overworked covid ward hospital workers read comments realizing going even overworked soon. man done everything could half population still continue demonize him. feel  Pretty telling newly rampant Delta variant spread southern states little effect stock market. Happy birthday dude!! Parents can‚Äôt leave room. ‚Äúin‚Äù 100% living room zero exits visiting virtually behind glass door. Well chance kid dying covid less flu. Would keep kid lockdown permanently avoid it? interestingly, SF experiencing mini housing resurgence, despite tech firm headquarters either shuttered manned skeleton crews. Older GenZ younger Millenials returning SF social &amp; in-person networking/collab opportunities. There's feeling especially among engaged start-ups they'll lose ground &amp; momentum they're physically engaged broader like-minded community. know Manhattan bit different driven big-money IB &amp; PE firms (and ancillary financial &amp; legal services around Wall St) synergism similar. Ideally might correct, practically wrong. Schools exist fulfill role daycare parents work. kind baked fabric society. put fingers ears stamp feet, screaming so, walks like duck, talks like duck, shits like duck, quackslike duck... duck. Everything health aside, hard weigh potential COVID child vs. academic/social/emotional development impact virtual. trivial.  Austin definitely follow countries fuck up, variants we'll get

brazil produced gamma, devastating south america

giving rise cases US, likely next variant concern come there; unless grow balls make vaccination mandatory, lawyer, would assume faking vaccine certificates get international border would one easiest cases prosecute. It'd basically free bonus points pad prosecutors stat sheets since cases would likely plead $bigfine+probation. Lots Canadians family US. Travel bans fucking suck. Thanks source, stupid. dunno, someone Facebook I‚Äôve never met said don‚Äôt really believer 49 scientific studies??     gone Easter good bad cloth masks? They're use want single use masks I've heard cloth ones super effective? Two friends mine loved ones pass away‚Äîsuddenly‚Äîfrom COVID last couple weeks. Unvaccinated unmasked, course. don‚Äôt need media tell real. since *know* real, still want convince it‚Äôs lies? average aged vaccinated person, constantly parroted around here, nothing worry regards death hospitalization. Hence point. Oh baby. much butthurt haha.  wanted money.

Each kids care paid Federal government CARES Act. Money paid Federal government Florida hospital systems.

It's effectively stimulus dollars make look like he's improving Florida economy.

What Federal government done bill states back June 30, 2021. let states figure get enough vaccination mask usage keep costs down... let states suffer financial turmoil. naive reasonable assumption proportion subpopulation (vaxxed vs. not) exposed. never see spoken much of, DeSantis got vaccine think months exposure death

Work reading getting started takes months deaths kick could months start seeing real death numbers children

I say everyone exposed now, going take months die. (it would late everyone it, assuming thats meant stupid)

a small % people it.. going take months deaths kick in.

not ""deaths happen"". 

""oh shit theres lot delta deaths children, something it""

/u/ganner ""well lot relative term, look population earth really 'a lot' per say....""

thanks contribution... ZERO sympathy unvaccinated hospitalized makes disgusting media forum post articles people hospital regretting getting vaccine expecting us feel sympathy them. sucks vaccinated part hospital staff. truly feel sorry attend way didn‚Äôt need happen sometimes wear gaiter surgical mask, hope people think I'm anti masker. :( flying? average vaccinated person absolutely cares death hospitalization figures. two things reason pandemic thing first place. Yes!! Get vaccine; however feels like late live southern state unless extremely proactive masking hunkering, cause state governments don‚Äôt give fuck. There's toxic individualistic mindset says, ""It's responsibility keep safe, mine."" comes relation kinds matters - like taxes welfare, unemployment, healthcare, etc. pandemic reminds us extremely individualistic mindset incompatible reality world beings interconnected interdependent. Yet concept life individuals competing runs deep cultures. Denial one way people insulate fully realizing there's something fundamentally wrong whole individualistic model life. LMAO.

China gets massive amounts money US consumers. pandemic severely reduced flow goods money. Huge economic losses suffered China regards deaths, quarantines, lockdowns.

For benefit China, need gain something. Right now, idea gained. US recovering economically faster China, that's out. Militarily, nothing changed. Western vaccine rollout happened sooner effective Chinese version.

Even maintaining status quo goal, failed. China suffer decades economically world stage pandemic. metric China comes ahead this.

If measure success China brought world knees instead China, I'd say fool. amount containment Chinese would worked. takes 1 case start surge. fully isolating China spare world, bought maybe month two timeline would shifted, reduced.

Besides, China best keep virus approaching travel season. locked country cancelled holiday travel, would admitting failed containment would massed riots/protests. Chinese government cannot appear weak people. Locking would exactly that.

China 'let' virus escape. quickly see cases pop New Zealand, one best responders. best efforts would enough. Claiming purposefully let virus escape benefit China fallacious best conspiracy theory worst.    felt uncomfortable person quoted article demanding allowed Canada Florida.  pediatrician, bothers everyone concerned COVID children completely ignoring bigger threat, RSV. want people aware threat RSV  Dat white upper middle class lyfe caught cold since January 2020, let alone anything serious.  RESPIRATORS OPTIONAL SMILING.

THANK ATTENTION MATTER. RIP. US? March 2020: We're together!

June 2020: 

Half population - can't tell do! hoax! rights! get get it. God's will.

The half population - Wear mask, go big gatherings, social distance public, stick outdoor activities, wait vaccine. Got it. Maybe spent year getting educated, perhaps better understanding science works. immunity community desolation isolation. reporter's words, believe cautious.   nurse test anyone symptoms. problems temp checking everyone didn‚Äôt take lot time. One station breakfast door teacher checked kids coming classroom morning. office staff checked visitors latecomers answered doorbell. wall mounted thermometer staff self check came in. actually one easier changes. Untested what? Huh? need take another PCR test order come back US Canada (as US PR)? people picking fight reason act tough. Political reasons wrapped many.

Exactly *doing* fighting prevent children protecting mask. makes someone feel tough? big mountain insecurity would take reasonable person ensure kids less safe? ones told dont work dont believe yer ""sciences"" unfortunately Show Fauci Ouchie touched night?

Oh wait, didn't. Right. different getting Lollapalooza. powerpoint presentation Washington Post got ahold TBH nothing really scandalous. want hear experts go report page-by-page, [this Week Virology (starting around 9:40 video).

The presentation written response cluster COVID cases Provincetown, July; event led CDC recommend vaccinated people start wearing masks areas high rates infection. announced public via CDC's normal official method, Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report newsletter. [MMWR summary July 2021, following multiple large public events Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases identified among Massachusetts residents traveled town July 3‚Äì17; 346 (74%) occurred fully vaccinated persons. Testing identified Delta variant 90% specimens 133 patients. Cycle threshold values similar among specimens patients fully vaccinated implications public health Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking indoor public settings, particularly large public gatherings include travelers many areas differing levels SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

The big deal ""cycle threshold values"" (which number get PCR testing look viral RNA snot samples) they're generally used proxy infectious somebody might be. apparently seem hold true somebody immunity -- lower Ct value means test sample viral RNA it, means person viruses them. viruses share friends neighbors!

So see CDC might get worried saw Ct values similar vaccinated non-vaccinated people Provincetown outbreak. saw news headlines said stuff like ""Vaccinated people infectious non-vaccinated people"", based on.

But (as TWiV crew discusses video) there's big caveat PCR testing! really good telling much viral RNA sample, can't tell anything whether viruses infect others not. looking RNA can't distinguish replication-competent virus particles (which infect others) little bits broken virus left immune system stomped (which can't). People immunity due vaccination prior natural infection would able start stomping viruses within hours. means CDC (and scary news headlines) likely wrong infectiousness vaccinated person. think really blame CDC taking cautious course action though.

We'll studies actually know well vaccinated people transmit.  got bridge need sit under? may make feel better! received 3rd dose. story second. Third dose nothing sore arm bit tired next day! Alabama increased almost exponentially since July 6th reported decrease last *three days*. know long enough comfortably claim cases coming back yet. Yeah, looking forward wrong. truly depressing thing right about. \*this\* right? Fuck.   don‚Äôt forget - fewer medical staff last year COVID caused much burnout. 2 billion children across world, country across world (even vaccinated ones) seem plan vaccinating well, actually I'd say actually need vaccinate 7,8 billion people...

Unless suddenly want vaccinate underage folk well, case literally country significant scale? Iowa, too. don‚Äôt know happened years weren‚Äôt always dumb. also third shot. Moderna trial. basically identical third same. father also got booster. vaccinated January mid/late 70s, Pfizer. went CVS... fill blank disclosed get third shot, (or disclose). advocating this... advocating this...  logic facial barrier better none seems people don‚Äôt agree Fucking aliens? knows. good blame do. us look like dbags, China can't shit.  don‚Äôt see comment different? You‚Äôre making focus suspected (which, let‚Äôs honest, even they‚Äôre COVID, hospitalized symptoms right now, least COVID) cases instead ACTUAL ISSUE: kids hospitalized increasing-rate due COVID. 

Your post reads exactly like deniers post. gotta keep focusing everything issue. Good, FDA EUA means vaccines rigorously tested safety efficacy. Unfortunate took Delta catalyst this. military probably *first* mandate, led example.

I personally encountered anti-vax argument ""The military even mandate vaccines!"" wild. read long they‚Äôre wearing masks social distancing, that‚Äôs fine; it‚Äôs responsible amongst us keep safe long time vaccine Republicans refuse vaccination wearing masks largely blame, many people saying that.

Yes, they‚Äôre getting vaccines. *But they‚Äôre wearing masks!*

So long they‚Äôre wearing masks, greatly reduced risk contracting spreading COVID. That‚Äôs fine. wore masks long time.

The problem people don‚Äôt get vaccine *and also don‚Äôt wear masks*. They‚Äôre getting spreading COVID around communities, we‚Äôre seeing Republican areas hit hard right now.

We Republican governors legislators literally *banning mask mandates*. think mask mandates important preventing spread COVID, acknowledge horrible thing is. Thats literally article about.    Yeah, fucking shit? data reminded exchange:
 Yea find odd well. I‚Äôm 100% pro mask. unlike fellow parents fail outraged daycare doesn‚Äôt require masks children. daughter goes daycare wear cloth masks don‚Äôt fit right, half photos they‚Äôre falling finally toddlers sense hygiene. terribly convinced anything situation.  still change fact Americans. like never stopped British 1783 Treaty Paris signed. mean blowing nose coughing open right inside full bus morning commute polite?

I wore mask reason pre Covid one getting stared at. People US selfish. here! Welcome booster club. side effect bit tired next day. That‚Äôs literally said, wishing bad case scenario (aka death) someone. Stay banned u/GodzillaSSD bot, would MechaGodzillaSSD?  wish lived Australia. I‚Äôm Texas healthcare worker well. hospital FULL. I‚Äôm afraid yes I‚Äôm young healthy even get mild case need hospitalization I‚Äôm worried may room. also infant even get mild case may mild case her. husband (who fully vaccinated ASAP) would willing little things carry small risk risk small. Unfortunately area low vaccinated rates, masks, cases spiking. It‚Äôs safe us wish would least wear masks could feel safer.

Pediatric hospitals seeing record numbers. see reason cautious. 49 + 26 Department Health Human Services 9 a.m. today revealed 85 children admitted hospitals COVID-19 related issues Florida Sunday. Specifically, 49 children admitted ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù COVID-19, 26 admitted ‚Äúsuspected‚Äù COVID-19. I'm sure arguing masks vaccines ""filter"" produce monsters. argue first, ""filter"" far less important sheer quantity hosts protection. know fact virus spreads relatively slowly vaccinated population, even Delta. We've also seen recent studies show vaccinated still less likely transmit virus unvaccinated, even Delta.

We exact efficacy masking, simply impossible quantify. safe say nowhere near efficacy vaccines. best bet masking, worrying selective pressures. best bet vaccinate flying f_ck anything moves everywhere earth.

I mask myself, issues masks, feel argument bit top.   said, seems like even multiple countries fuck up, takes one country get overzealous give duck (see Brazil‚Äôs president) cause another mutation like delta? Yes 300 years ago we‚Äôd dead smallpox something. wife wouldn‚Äôt even exist she‚Äôs white family wouldn‚Äôt allowed here. would I. 

And women weren‚Äôt physicians. 

What‚Äôs point? return past? happening. proud Alma Mater! someone used work Ole Miss Men‚Äôs Basketball, proud athletic department helping leader state desperately needs leadership. 

For don‚Äôt understand important college athletics southeast especially Mississippi‚Äî- going HUGE gaining traction support many stragglers.

Not all‚Äî maybe even enough‚Äî it‚Äôs progress. Proud Landshark! No. wearing planes mandate came back LA. wear bare minimum to. would anyone talking breakthrough cases? phase 3 trials breakthrough cases. I'm Canadian look subs seem open border open fully vaxxed people.  Countries trying vaccinated citizens, seen pushback antivaxxers COVID deniers? Even mandate vaccinations, still sizeable portion population get them. present factual criticism, response basically ""all praise fauci""?? think think critically things? CDC putting science second political expediency. Like CDC saying schools would safe kids kept 6 feet apart, schools complained 6 feet, changed recommendation 3 feet. there's political push fully reopen schools regardless science saying can't done safely many cases. 

And Fauci lying effectiveness face masks dismissed ""WE HEART FACUI"". worship people. Consider:

every respiratory virus spreads infected people exhaling viruses either droplet aerosol both. Face coverings reduce amount viruses inhaled especially viruses exhaled sick people. can't calim information changed new data, knew respiratory virus spreads like every respiratory virus. Sure, study things like survives surfaces long, fact might known surface transmission stop telling us wash hands. wait data tell us wash hands knew good preventative measure respiratory viruses generally. say wear masks? wanted doctors nurses get first. ya know what? gotten first. lie public that. Secure supply chain amazon etc stop selling individuals hospitals (which still did). meantime, tell general public use masks make home (which anyway) masks could purchased. lying make would doubt anyway ammo say know anything guessing. allow virus spread largely unchecked among general population told wear masks. Meanwhile morgues filled members community died. Slowing virus early would made big difference back then. 

Now, going make rational response fanboy lying public servant again? I'll tell friends Gear-Girl knows what's up. Jesus died sins, death would wasted, sin lot Someone want give 411 delta came from?  little bit high schools, nothing impactful. primary school level (my daughter's age), really anything. allowed sing class bring reading books back thursday instead Friday could set aside three day quarantine, still hugging holding hands, masks high school.

I'm pretty sure happening. even real confederate flag either idea privilege pay 0 kind therapy Ah. It‚Äôs rerun  Hurry up! nothing worse.  It‚Äôs crazy America mask vaccines become political thing. It‚Äôs amazing see mixed statements this. say Delta responds, breakthrough infections vaccinated individuals Delta. Delta different S1 subunit spike protein. supposedly breakthrough infections might even worry Lambda variant based vitro results. ""The 180 millionth person get vaccine change mind"" - said one ever [Relevant want kid wear mask, provide kid mask instruct wear it.

A disinterested view absent political leaning, reality situation us presently. neck gaiters double layer work well face masks, yeah, single layer, double triple over. Yeah work. wanna share, Philippines we're required wear plastic faceshield everywhere(transpo, establishments, places) Statewide 7/29 we'd 2,345 hospitalizations 34 deaths. shove smug attitude ass. Kids literally dying important keep party line.  Sorry, meant terms impacting us end school year. indeed 16s now. Infection one disease stop another disease coming in. People fact get multiple illnesses conditions right. exactly good news lot easier create new line mRNA vaccines new antibiotic. That‚Äôs lot. give em $20  ""people infected Delta variant carry detectable virus earlierthan original virus (four days versus six days exposure)and another study found remain infectious longer (**18 days** versus 13 days)."" It‚Äôs flight airports worry most, honestly. news shows garbage showing harsh realities human suffering.  Totally possible, I'm healthcare worker father immunocompromised... work 7 days week (6 hrs day) could well pick without appropriate warning time. scary time alive decided would best risk :/ would vegan help? I'm beginning think fabrication antivaxers. Can't find stats this. know anyone issue. know anyone knows anyone issue. anyone can't get vaccinated knows someone like love hear that's even real like .0001% population. know what? 10 people get vaccination card doctor saying exempt would allow life vaccinated person. However imagine people probably quite sickly begin always self isolated way covid. 

I'd love real facts cause I'm sick argument. course there'd exemption medical reasons like blind person bring dog target others cannot. Yes always fucking holes take advantage I'm sure way could 40% population.   still even debating this? don‚Äôt keep helmet walk around getting bike

Why not? Thousands people die falling every year. Many live issues. lack comfort worth risk reduction it? 

Well, that's many us new mask mandates. got vaccinated took safety steps needed. We'll wear masks feel sick go reason. forced wear time small chance get sick spread others without symptoms akin making us wear helmet we're bike. case bunch assholes refused even wear helmet bike get vaccinated. baby! associate infected people. /shocked parents 

RSV devil itself. Adding another infection terrifying.  Honestly, I've expecting tried help parents understand seriousness situation.  Whatever fallout experience going hard vaccination mandates quarantines, can't fight resolve dead. either, choose risk death order keep ""freedoms"", live fight another day. un-vaccinated get Covid, take-backsies. 

Did post article karma bad faith? comment sure seems like did. American Academy Pediatricians, know idea actual situation vs making stuff ignorant perspective. they‚Äôre demographic lowest vaccination rates. Thanks, Joe Rogan. Oh god's sake. I'm vegetarian never considered second getting vaccine. typically avoid things tested animals life saving vaccine. got first shot back March hospital soon appointments available. appreciate insight. We're New England willing travel lower risk areas like Maine (other grandparents) NH, seems like unacceptable risk. 330k people / day getting vaccine shot France. 250k people street far major opinion medias want us think so. getting ridiculous, artificially made there's nothing else talk about. understand excluded elderly main trials. would taken lot longer, deaths occurred would halted trials investigation. Whether deaths associated covid not. 

A major problem loss efficacy age conveyed. pretty clear 5-6 months ago 1/3 people 80 didn‚Äôt produce enough antibodies fight infection, delta requiring even higher antibody threshold, likely majority vaccinated elderly aren‚Äôt protected infection. least still protected severe disease cases. old kid? education help fears. Like take science class It‚Äôs terrifying consider 1% chance isn‚Äôt going stay 1% allow thing keep mutating way it‚Äôs going to. Oh shit that‚Äôs actually hilarious. animal products many foods aren‚Äôt obviously meat cheese. Sorry, Sharon. can‚Äôt donuts. realize many children currently hospitalized Covid right? Look it‚Äôs scary to, said, though many words. exchanging words woman FB would let child vaccinated. said she'd rather take chance covid. I‚Äôve given convincing people masks vaccines work feel love lost. We‚Äôre far pandemic, virus changed, you‚Äôre still refusing face facts, you‚Äôre hopeless.

All studies proof world aren‚Äôt going convince idiots. Wonder next goal post going FDA approved vaccine. Same. Stopped wearing one since fully vax'd mask mandate state ended. worn one since May Dr. Office. plan going back wear one unless business going requires one. previously worn mask everywhere since March 20. dont since part. Unless to, wearing one way handling completely different before. anything made mess current handlings. Everyone America drowning alone. fought hard market rather society, lesson learned damage remains. know proper/legit documentation vaccine?

Look idc agree opinion not. CTV worded title better done better reporting rather ""oh everything peachy"".  refuse get vaccine, fire them. vaccinated worker hospital fucking dumb begin with, even COVID. went several years longer aircraft carrier pretty tightly packed environment, shows mask work. help prevent spread, protected wearer. Vaccine hesitancy large issue US reason slow vaccination rate limited supply much world Except kids largely don‚Äôt catch Covid begin with. still don‚Äôt know long-term effects vaccine, either. Like all. part true...? understand afraid world seems like scary place. control security feel lack **not** best replaced false sense superiority ""understanding"" anti-vaxx cult wants believe they've given you.

You ""special knowledge"" thanks Facebook groups, Q-anon tweets, weird Reddit subs. serious, knowledgeable people. random joes, like you, adrift world seems indifferent passing by, struggling make sense things are. They're experts. *know* experts. can't *interpret* data experts. discard information fit they've already decided believe inflate importance veracity littel detail, matter absurd untrustworthy, meshes chosen worldview. That's find truth.

Just like someone swept river grab anything, *anything* keep pulled downstream, folks grasping anything, *anything* might stop them. drowning person tricky save, panic often shove rescuers underwater, too. let easy answers surety antivaxx groups blind people actually know what's going trying help. 

Few answers life easy, ones seem like often wrong. Vaccination one rare cases best, smartest thing also pretty simple. Thousands, *tens* thousands scientists working decades creating vaccines, studying them, making better. mRNA technology development long COVID-19 hit. Yes, money-grubbing pharmaceutical companies going make bank, I'm fan them, you, insidious plot. There's 5G microchip, there's mind control, there's ""shedding"", there's planned extermination. 

It's vaccine help immune system recognize defeat COVID get really sick; training manuals syringe body's natural defenders get ready fight monster shows door. right yourself, right friends family, right neighbors: please get vaccine. Yes; referring AZ predominant vaccine UK beginning year. vaccines ramping production take time easy get US. cushy WFH job don‚Äôt think working class mostly made minorities (Black &amp; Hispanic)  begins. we‚Äôre going fight disease, let‚Äôs fight one terrible disease all, indifference.

(Robin Williams, Patch Adams) dont think Fauci gets it. people addressing give zero shits community. message reach them. Thank you. may unpopular opinion non Canadians getting cases areas, last year bad situation American travelers put 2 communities risk said give fuck got sick. That‚Äôs tough spot, still wouldn‚Äôt it. know sucks. kids haven‚Äôt seen grandparents since December 2019 except weekly video calls. I‚Äôm New England they‚Äôre Western NY. We‚Äôre vaccinated (except little), they. don‚Äôt want take risk. 

My oldest micropreemie I‚Äôve sat bedside son ventilator, IV lines over, doctors couldn‚Äôt tell he‚Äôd survive. never want again. misread. hold antibiotic resistant bacteria? Precisely forces work.

It does. Bacteria evolve antibiotic resistance.  Sure - multiple dynamics. Iceland relatively cases before, low natural immunity, they've given lots J&amp;J/AZ vaccines appear worse Delta kinda disappointing I'd say expect going forward, outbreaks put opt vaccine hospital. Smaller countries vaccination rates 70%, bigger countries below. U.K. cases somewhat stabilized fairly high daily rates.

The U.K. saw \~16x increase daily covid deaths. U.S., would translate \~3,700 daily deaths new peak follow U.K. (about month behind terms cases peaking vaccination rate). Given number children United States tested positive COVID, 349 statistically meaningless number.  can‚Äôt say medically speaking, 2 COVID tests past nose basically dry, runny, nurses tests didn‚Äôt comment say anything. times came back negative.

I'm vaccinated social distanced nonstop since Feb 2020 like Fauci. like lied national television people need wear masks. fact, made sound like wearing mask made one *more likely* get sick.

""The FDA strongly consider authorizing vaccines children ages 5-11 years based

the expanded cohort post-market setting. approach would slow time authorization 
of critically needed vaccines 5‚Äì11-year age group.""

They're literally saying approved based initial trial group.

They go say, seemingly callback given momentum political decision expand trial, new group needs followed four two months six.

Waiting January literally murder.

Even opening schools advance approval unwise - unnecessary, original trial wrapping up, surprises. Nobody's wanting change anything way things already always worked. We've already always various schools employers require certain vaccines. We've already always various schools employers require results certain tests disease. work university done research hospital settings. required flu vaccine show negative TB test. say science sound?? 10 years vaccinations, impossible make comment time. believe narrow minded uneducated fuck, science pharmaceutical companies made tremendous amount bad decisions society past. double vaxxed pro-vaxxer, dont act like dick, makes anti vaxxers stronger look like crazy discredit position. Thanks much. Thank god ER even damn bed. anti-vaxxers keep they'll packed. Ah, missed reference, thanks. tempted say racism probably greater metal crime anti-mask/anti-vaxx, course deeply rooted ignorance either much little credulity. vocal?

But real, feasible. Even temp checking incoming kids feasible. idea difficult logistics getting saliva samples 5,000 kids spread 10 buildings? even went class waited results, would late stop spread. 

Testing mass crowd events way this. security theater. like self reporting temp checks done home. one took serious. one audited data. Ah, makes sense. homeschooled middle school, far advanced peers joined public school. placed advanced classes, tested every non-elective English class remainder years school. I'm parent, definitely see friends homeschool well, others, kids quite bit behind. I'm sure experience, better idea homeschooling! Best luck it, healing trauma poor home-schooling neglect. Unless misinformation. downvote shit that. Haha, getting voted people clues. Henan, province borders Hubei population nearly 100 million, far fewer cases Taiwan. compare Taiwan Chinese provinces, response COVID horrendous, although still magnitudes better US‚Äôs. Vaccine rates continue rise week-to-week, albeit wonder people get lax soon get vaccine

Not quite. EVERYONE got lax, that's cases going way are. Combined fact people Delta contagious sooner infection, explains everything that's happening latest 'wave'.  US employers smoke 'em via free company BBQ.   Never said would easy. None easy. You‚Äôre living one nicest places country state actually gives shit residents children still parents assume making high incomes relatively. us (myself included) anywhere near level security. make sure decisions based reality stay safe there. urgent care clinic we‚Äôre required open vial every time someone walks seeking Covid vaccine. 5 people don‚Äôt happen walk them, that‚Äôs 5 doses waste. think want third shot reading stuff. go getting one? sorry hear that. certain case non-covid case denied best treatment antivax dipshit using resources fight illness 99% could prevented getting free vaccine widely available months.

Dude, 5 year olds well iPads. need tons interaction play.

We're trying one-size-fits-all solution fit sizes. can't expect young child sit learning exercises iPad like adults Zoom needs one adults household given sort stipend able stay home children assist learning process almost like teacher's assistant teacher end screen.

There way we're going give stipend that's enough replace people's incomes. I'm (SF Bay Area) looking millions dollars day. Where's going come get struggle really think answer sending back schools right now.

AAP does. believe actual child medicine experts? .. that's said.

There's time intubation know it, time symptoms testing.. tested dying even typical 3 weeks

This also Delta, children

So stand statement even though Delta ""here""... (Small % state) could months start seeing real death numbers children  legally need full FDA approval this, think sign full approval imminent. vaccinate residents contribute campaigns. figured eventually someone thread would find negative spin put this. Didn‚Äôt take long. sub hell bent miserable. Pandemic results less across multiple countries regardless compliant rules. Stuff like genuinely hope. handful patriots standing trusting either courts federal government protect them.  Covid hoax let hoax kill mask. Entitlement. People think activities right privilege. real question is: delta hospitalizing individuals wouldn‚Äôt hospitalized previous variants.

Surely putting people hospital variants weren‚Äôt hospitalization rate would higher variants? 

It‚Äôs still putting kids underlying conditions hospital also putting significant number perfectly healthy kids hospital TOP susceptible children would notice spike pediatric hospitalization rate sure going see spike mask mandates dropped. happen, thought really beat thing.

The frustrating part Delta going peak first two months school, weeks vaccine available 12. I've seen bunch pop kzoo area well. someone heavily invested Cruise Line stocks great new! faking vaccine certification carries 5 year jail sentence. want border closed forever. get got 70% eligible population vaccinated opened border exclusively Americans present vaccine status.

It's phase 1 reopening allow green card holders citizens.

To doubts people coming fake records. system never going 100% safe people always try game it. That's phased opening makes sense. need start going back towards normalcy. People love public health. makes sense hate putting public health risk. Yeah, I'm sure companies working that. thing is, variant genome still similar vaccine efficacy still high hard come something better. future boosters slightly tinkered formulas, sure, answer current problems new vaccine, current vaccines. curiosity, anybody who's seriously claiming COVID-19 *is* transmissible disease?

Or somebody claiming COVID-19 can't bad more-transmissible diseases there? prefer throwing paywalled links archive.is  Try article. thought good read. news sources that? are, indeed, lying.   people need wear seat belt drink drive then? logic get trashed drive around without seatbelt texting. suggestion. hospital staffs fully vaccinated? WTF??? Illegal strike government employees.

I understand emergency workers, government employees. signed that? Nah man. got vaccine still power rabid base followed suit. Don‚Äôt try let hook. problem Louisiana's vaccination rate abysmal right now. festival held northeast, vaccination rates almost double Louisiana's, doubt would canceled, it'd get vaccine mandate. Unfortunately, fly economically socially Louisiana, enough people vaccinated event would become hotspot. vaccines great, mRNA ones give protection faster (in 1-2 weeks) J&amp;J (2-4 weeks). Masculinity definitely something it. Look Conservative radio host fighting life hospital due Covid. air saying embarrassing would died Covid. He's worried life he's worried people think him. ego. depends area. states countries statues allow minors consent medical care shown clearly best interest understand risks benefits treatment, although sometimes limited treatment things like drug use, STDs pregnancy, mental health issues since often create issues teens getting treatment parents approve. double jabbed, right? least masks. governor banned schools requiring masks. pull kids one us quit job. wife doesn‚Äôt want pull them. Less aerosol escapes masked face, specifically tight-fitting mask still MIT study showed took 5 times longer masked person infect room non-masked person, alpha strain.  1 2 happen. think know that. delta variant became dominant US sometime mid July I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre expecting definitive conclusions affects children month later. CDC showing increase hospitalizations among children. Go find data yourself. think you‚Äôve already decided what‚Äôs happening Under-12 Americans vaccinated allowed without quarantine. Generic, well tolerated drug. 

This one might shot.

Now watch idiots stockpile need can't get it. get damn shot. Yeah, feel like we're making progress &amp; can't stand overall things getting better bs. Kids 12 cannot vaccinated yet &amp; gaslighting tell parents everything ok. I'm tired it. I'm PANICKING inability keep children safe bc selfish idiots controlling state. Like even get appendicitis break bone, there's pediatric beds ER them! Wtf! hate hellhole.  adult pretend parent. pharmacy supposed ask questions would barrier vaccination.

What? hear friend, build office space living.

We start band. Strange look ‚ÄúWhat children?!‚Äù people. different. never guarantee getting covid vaccine would able spread it. assurance chances symptomatic infection greatly decreased, along chances getting hospitalized dying decreased even more.

There never false advertising wouldn‚Äôt get sick even get bad case. goal make sure chances staying hospital reaching morgue slim possible. 

Anything stated vaccine claimed would never get sick spread covid fake propaganda. Strange look ‚ÄúWhat children?!‚Äù people. appreciate actual, reputable source saying, can't compare numbers without reading bit it. 434 number *estimated* deaths children 18 (almost flu number find prior years same). read rest link sent, find lab confirmed flu deaths children 18 **199** 2019-2020. Lab confirmed Covid deaths group end 2020 (generous, since includes first months pandemic really gotten rolling excludes January 2021 deaths peaked) **198** (data source one second link uses: 

So even excluding peak Covid pandemic, yearly flu deaths covid deaths same. Also consider basically shut many schools person learning, socially distanced, (mostly) wore masks (something flu season). think hard time arguing flu deadlier covid children (at least total numbers; may may deadlier given someone already infected , I'm qualified knowledgeable enough speak that). 

btw, like first source report number lab-confirmed cases estimate based on. I've found surprisingly difficult number find comes number flu cases without digging pretty deep data/literature. Yup, American. Definitely checks out. 

Damn I‚Äôm sad one half time Anyone caught providing fake vaccination records banned life, property brought across border confiscated (car included) given year jail. One two charges like would put stop nonsense quickly.

I mind fully vaccinated people coming across border, lesser risk people know get vaccine try lie way across border different trying get illegal drugs across. Jail time banned life. STOP REWARDING HOLDOUTS. 
 
Hey guys next time there‚Äôs emergency giant piece shit, you‚Äôll get free stuff! 
 
No carrots menaces, bring sticks. SCI think misunderstand situation. 

My dad needs heart surgery. week. Typically doctor would allow patient situation rest home final tests pre-op. 

However, doctor admit dad tests inpatient, possible dad would able get surgery needs week due COVID surge. get surgery, well could bad. 

The doctor well within rights admit father given poor health. normal times wouldn‚Äôt big deal since could admitted day surgery. However, thanks COVID surge Florida, may able admit week due lack beds. would delay surgery potentially bad results. 

So doctor best thing make patient likely well. I‚Äôm thankful doctor dad needs surgery ASAP would good turned away. 50 would convinced me, 49? We're canceling surgery today. Staff calling exposed vaccinated. Good luck guys. sterilizing immunity available vaccines. Breakthrough cases also existed delta. stopped second cases much I‚Äôm back wearing one indoors now. Yeah bother even caring 18 year olds? good run, expect live forever? /s  kids get sent school state mask mandates banned. There‚Äôs nowhere around trials 12. I‚Äôve even tried sign kids trials state say it‚Äôs far. sure hope approve kids 12 soon. Really think risks covid worse vaccine mean fluid dynamics pretty obvious. Put coffee filter tightly top bowl filled blue water shake it. Remove filter shake it. pretty simple concept pretty stupid understand tight woven barrier fluid-filled breath cloud reduces amount dispersed applied macro level incredibly important. USA-- states allow teens vaccinated without parental consent. Anti-vaxxers would laugh vaccinated people dropping dead mind would make ‚Äòright‚Äô. 
 
Stop fucking carrots bring sticks. argument battle vaccines tested tried years going masses approval. covid vaccine rushed still approved. imagine shit show would unfold FDA says something wrong can‚Äôt approve it? think Jan 6th bad‚Ä¶ Nope. 3 vaccinated adults, 2 unvaccinated littles. supposed flying Daytona Thursday cancelled. way would take unvaccinated children FL.  send anyone home vaccinated? fundamentally believe individual, also live consequences. beds full, priority given issues people vaccinated / people medically could get vaccine. put big enough error bars things point body naturally overcome it. Like cold remedies work 10 days. people naturally recover cold length time. question still asked?

At point, rational people convinced, study convince hold outs. researchers might well testing theory earth round. I've heard surgical masks primary protect surgical team bodily fluids blood getting mouth. get reelected next year. people love hate state. Personally, think anyone goes cruise fool, even COVID. virus breaks board stuck there, possibly weeks. Umm, so? Still open air 5 minutes. Virus goods proven much less concern originally thought.

Masks aren‚Äôt perfect either like moving good good. Much different shopping indoors long period time. They've popped mid size ones rural northern Michigan last years.

They building fast missed initial construction would drive brand new one seemed like popped nowhere! It‚Äôs definitely scary! place live health insurance would leave thousands dollars debt. 

Was best friend vaccinated time? think given comfort reading statistics currently 99% pregnant women hospital currently not. course new variants change, right seems risky quit. 

Both choices anxiety inducing though funny, that's exactly felt living Los Angeles initial outbreak, moved...to Indonesia!

The non-COVID hospitals capacity, least bankrupt me. Getting COVID would suck tho'. huh?? i'm guessing rural areas hammering big city hospitals like crazy. dipshits. Good job It‚Äôs deadly. However children get infected‚Ä¶the bad outcomes. 

If get delta would appear odds hospitalized dying got infected another variant. think confusing transmissibility survivability.

People still choose employed take job. one example. many ways go this. Throwing hands blaming random people probably worst way go this. understand expects cruise ships operate without everyone vaccinated, unless thinks stay sea days coming back Florida, stops between. Dental surgeons too? think UK belongs group. 90% adults already vaccinated least one dose: Yup argument last summer. benefit saying anything, already lost. lost me. I'm US vaccinated three times already (the last one part Pfizer booster trial). kid came home European country goes college summer finally able get Pfizer shots classmates barely getting access first shot waiting another 12 weeks second. friends developing countries getting vaccinated connections ability fly country surplus. terrible. Good point correct easy see anti-maskers/vaxxers intentionally sowing chaos, disruptive, absurdly frivolous largest teachers union would honest tell that. rise pediatric covid deaths United States, period. Deaths population still extremely rare. think people take covid seriously lying help anyone. Fair enough. made comment 15 year old mind. I've also able find KN95 fit smaller kids. main issue firms pay huge amount money operating costs.

I'm biased. best friend baby last year getting covid. spend month isolated hospital worrying every day losing baby. time, visitors allowed. harrowing experience daughter born almost 3 months premature. assess risks way. know circulating white tailed deer US people raising flag Wuhan, right? 

I think prior strain stateside since least 2017. human infection reached critical mass prompt drive test determine *exactly* causing uptick influenza like illness. J&amp;j great choice! worry it. sister millions others gotten problem think there's notable difference anti-vax community people seem address. example, vaccine hesitancy extremely high amongst diverse (more often black) communities due history involving Tuskegee Studies Trials. Full FDA approval certainly ease concerns types anti-vaxxers, big net positive since vaccines seen less ""experimental"", matter false claims begin with.

However, stereotypical/media-portrayed anti-vaxxers: white, conservative, lower/middle class, generally located midwest south. Even FDA approval, highly doubt see increase vaccination rates.

He actually weird respiratory bug first week July actually screwed behavior regressed him, psychologically, caused sleep disturbances. Covid way worse get Covid.

It‚Äôs terrible situation around. don‚Äôt think kids carry burden protect adults. apologize that‚Äôs message interpreted. old church (trump enough done it), they've pleading pleading since vaccine first came (I still get emails). I'd willing bet maybe 20% rate.\*

(re: death spike infection spike) mRNA boosters incredibly effective according moderna's data. Two doses valuable; try space far allowed.

There's absolutely reason think safety issues. People get multiple vaccines year time problem. concern ""too many"" doses immune system eventually get fixated one disease cost others.

Anecdotally friend Norway doses AZ quit using made get doses pfizer. Quite waste. COVID already vaccines. I'm also encouraging anyone get infected instead vaccinated, truth truth, spin omit it? pretend millions people immunity addition millions vaccinated? True, may insured. quite unintelligent point. Individual liberties okay, must stop second put everyone else risk. Yes, vaccine mandates needed try sneak backdoor. directly openly let courts decide complaints. Moderna trialing using half dose booster.  morons need charged Federal crimes. Misuse government seal felony, right? parents sister South FL, 10 hr drive me. considering visiting anytime soon vaccinated 12 yo unvaccinated 11 yo.

Remember mask protects others masks protect you. point fighting littles wear masks one else around respecting social distancing wearing masks.

Edit: typos Big ups commitment wrong side this. üòµ‚Äçüí´ It‚Äôs funny say that. live southern US anti maskers used info sow little seed ‚ÄúCovid flu‚Äù. 

They think thousands doctors medical professionals dishonest results. fact masks, social distancing, contact tracing severely reduced spread illnesses. One less kid might mean less votes votes whoever opponent next November. he's sunk former president.

People forget government time. forget kid dying. Nobody problem 'no shirt, shoes, service' either. god, add masks help save neighbor hell breaks loose.  you‚Äôre position direct, prolonged contact someone else, think it‚Äôs 100% fair ask they‚Äôre vaxxed wouldnt think twice asking.

That‚Äôs kinda whole problem ‚Äúit‚Äôs personal choice‚Äù line reasoning.

As soon affect others, becomes business well. Biden controlled CDC also told eligible persons get vaccinated GOP governors everything power stop that. can‚Äôt take things pieces. Maybe kids start dying tens thousands maybe hundreds thousands

There literally zero chance happening. take seriously without hyperbole catastrophizing. Public inquiry criminal investigation.   Many provinces close Wuhan direct flights trains, also recognized WHO, much better Taiwan. I'm sure, winter, going enough immunologically naive people (neither vaccinated previously infected) wave bad we're seeing now.  I'm confusing transmissibility survivability.

R value - R value much higher Delta, transmissibility.

Viral load - viral load counts studies 1000x previous variants.

Reproduction time - Delta also seems reproduce faster becoming detectable sooner previous variants.

P681R mutation - likely what's causing faster reproduction time. Delta able infiltrate cells faster previous variants.

Increased transmissibility symptom underlying cause. underlying cause faster robust viral reproducibility. efficient virus, therefore dangerous communities individuals. 

Fortunately, many parts world we've vaccinated lot people, especially vulnerable people. gives false sense security Delta bad. 

If want understand bad Delta is, need model without vaccine natural immunity have, pandemic started Delta. Imagine first wave moving twice fast 3x infections per cycle. makes current pandemic look benign. Yes, Fauci isn‚Äôt really position mandate anything, understand. He‚Äôs head NAIIAD (sp), state official. would concerned hide vaccine card. remember minor, pretty much difficult keep something simple post card away parent's eyes, wanted know see everything would go great lengh checking ""hiding spots"" see anything hidden didnt wanted parents see. OP's parents anything like mines, OP might hard time keeping vaccine card hidden. OP might even able excelsior app installed phone his/her parents could monitoring it, regularly revise see apps installed.

Getting vaccinated easy part. could easily see adult pretending OP's parents, making sure OP's parents see vaccine card/online record hardest part. Breakthrough cases dramatically shorter unvaccinated cases per [sg study, see figure mean long symptoms dramatically less likely initial severity. Sounds interesting.

Please direct resources subreddits could help!  Venn diagram zero COVID folks anti-vaxxers essentially circle. People rightly want everyone vaccinated taken way far think everyone ever mentioning getting another dose trying kill everyone around them. 

For low risk people there's really strong evidence third dose needed, given risk Myocarditis understand young men especially may want keep pumping Pfizer doses themselves.

I've covid 2 vaccine doses last 3 months, really see evidence would need benefit third Pfizer dose would likely engaging another 1/5,000 1/50,000 risk getting heart inflammation. I'm really worried Myocarditis would keep taking risk every 6 months see evidence benefit.

Really wish people Reddit would begin remember that, great Pfizer us pandemic, still pharmaceutical company sole goal making fat profit Chill wit context. dope circle jerk here. And?

Are going continue now? float they're stable. ever seen one real life? Anyone else remember gonna like 2 month thing? case study live NYC. State's Excelsior Pass app Blockchain verifies state database. contrast, NYC rolled glorified dick pic app ""COVID pass"". 

People cry perceived privacy issues fact pulling data already exists, makes concern nothing ignorance paranoia. People worried social media fun apps strealing data. I‚Äôm pulled Israel MoH data current hospitalizations. yesterday morning patients 60 severe disease:

196 patients - vaccinated
5 patients - partially vaccinated
64 patients - unvaccinated

91% demographic vaccinated. yields current ~65% vaccine efficacy severe disease demographic. convert percentage multipliers, need use context add/subtract original chance, represented 1. 

So, someone says something ""200% likely send hospital"", goes like this:

Original Chance(x) = 1x

Additional 200% = 2x

1x + 2x = 3x. 3 times likely before. 

To go multipliers percentage, simply reverse process.

3x - 1x = 2x

2x \* 100 = 200%. previously much, MUCH contagius diseases almost entirely eradicated due herd immunity, vaccines LESS effective trust me, NONE thresholds anywhere close 90-95% vaccinated.

I‚Äôd interested see data supporting that. Everything I‚Äôve seen suggests R value somewhere 5-10 required threshold herd immunity somewhere 85-95% (% vaccinated + % unvaccinated infected).

The difference covid diseases substantial percentage population already possessed antibodies. already lived long time vaccines rolled out, able grandfather vaccinations slowly part standard vaccination regimes children, whilst simultaneously targeting areas high occurrence.

We don‚Äôt widespread natural immunity time, though we‚Äôre getting problem COVID mutates quickly (apparently), strains reinfect. necessarily need 90% vaccinated population control it.

Reinfections quite rare afik. &lt;1%.

Vaccines progressively lower odds new variant mutations. knock back reduce rate infection, better odds harmful mutation. believe that, compared flu we‚Äôve gotten pretty good updating vaccines for, covid predecessors actually don‚Äôt mutate frequently. It‚Äôs Covid way potential hosts right now, number new opportunities mutate higher. I'm vaccines restrictions. 2 vaccines, 30 + risk factors risk death covid probably actually less 1/10,000 safe travel precautions, can't stay house indefinitely Floor padded got MCRD San Diego 2011.

So intentionally misleading anyone reads suggesting otherwise misrepresenting situation.

Go troll elsewhere conspiracy theories. question much difference third shot really makes.

It seems 2 shots protects well serious disease, although protection infection may wane. many people actually dying got 2 3 shots?

I think real question whether 3 shots helps stop people spreading it.

There early evidence though 3 shots increases amount detectable antibodies 'quality' antibodies variants. think people /r/coronavirus quick forget Pfizer Moderna obviously want get 3 shots, get money deliveries country makes. People need stop actually look science, morally surely right send doses countries still struggling supply rather give third dose someone 2 doses risk factors. think discussion different risk/old antibodies fade faster ""take risks"" thing crazy. America crumbling horrific mess is. Go purported first-world country everything nicer, including people. people happy America Somolia something. sterilizing vaccine isn‚Äôt possible? deaths 50+, like 75-80% vaccinated Also number people die-hard anti-vaxxers also travel lot probably quite small Best argue them. understand logic science mock you.

Appreciate responses!   tell American views think healthcare works here. 

No one goes ER get checked America, unless least $1,000 burn. 

Plus it‚Äôs Florida. don‚Äôt believe Covid, aren‚Äôt taking kids unless sick, sick. country fills kids DayQuil ships school big meeting work can‚Äôt miss. problem getting infected takes 15 minutes masks.

With cloth masks infected person contact them, 20 minutes infection. That's extra 5 minutes.

With wearing surgical masks 60 minutes.

For brief interactions, that's fine. feel people misinformed well type masks protect. Dr. Michael Osterholm. whole series it. 

However, stuck place bad ventilation DAY hour, probably getting infected unless wearing N95/94.

Also masks get wet, become likely get infected.

Masks data: mask Osterlholm: many reasons...what need types medical care states like Florida, Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, etc.? virus - lack vaccination - would throwing wrench plans.

We also know vaccines hold long term. initial Spanish Flu (\~1918) deadly. virus hung around later variants caused lot deaths.  Fauci said clean going bathroom, half country stop wiping ass spite. Decline vaccine, decline treatment. polio begets post-polio, measles begets subacute sclerosing panencephalitis Yep. know several Republicans (granted, moderate/classic Republicans Trumpists) turned back him. think he's putting chips White House run future looking rosy here. think annual supply masks employees still cheaper losing single day's worth revenue business. Masks worn physicians initial outbreak NYC prevented contracting covid, definitely work well enough. physicians working wards patients using CPAP machines aerosolizing particles continuously.  small-biz would shutdown day 25% employees got sick time, can't operate restaurant 25% line chefs call sick. started movement stop antivaxers taking over, main drive Republicans like Marjory Greene, Tucker Carlson, almost Republicans TV. they‚Äôre immunocompromised. wearing mask unvaccinated thus breaking law, that's immoral. Practicing bodily autonomy NOT.

By logic immoral drive drunk. Shame can't done whole country, we'd much better off. mean vaccines required take basic.  Also, breakthrough cases may much rarer pre-Delta. meaningless statistic downplays severity variants. Potentially silly question incoming - covid cases drop suddenly spiking?

I assume unvaccinated stayed unvaccinated throughout entire time period. mean drop subsequent increase mostly due breakthrough infections vaccinated? 

We keep hearing exceedingly rare breakthrough infections Alpha variant, longer surprise see one Delta. Yeah need masks get Rt 1 keep forever since soon take covid get control again. can't keep living like this, can't socialize everyone wear mask 2 &amp; 5 vote. rewards, cookies right thing. need get shit together get ostracized society. workplace instituted vaccine mandate. should. I‚Äôm fine restaurants, bars, grocery stores, cruise ships, amusement parks, etc requiring proof vaccination entering. 

These people joke need removed every place rest us enjoy going. Last year cousin started posting memes wearing mask dangerous mask, deleted Facebook account.

Literally. Seeing people know stupid stuff, take longer. Yes leaks they've outbreaks deaths, many isolation like said exactly get mess around North Korea say quarantine 4 weeks. think sarcasm fuck FDA even approved vaccines adults yet? agency needs replaced top bottom, can't fix something broken. Fuck Fauci covering inept bureaucrats. They're giving entire country VA experience. I'd say fully vaccinated low-risk individuals, staying home would detrimental potentially getting COVID. I'm saying people high-risk areas wear masks, can't expect people extremely low risk contracting COVID even lower risk dying ignore mental health put life hold forever. military largest employer US. gonna huge. same, Fauci could announce giving cocaine good health half country would start putting children's milk breakfast. know next nothing military, ¬´¬†quit¬†¬ª, don‚Äôt get unhonorable discharged? loose ¬´¬†vet status¬†¬ª it? strange reason, nobody wanted enroll heard placebo parachutes. Europe, pretty common sentence Brazil well.  Right surely randomly sampled - Im saying one possibility deaths randomly sampled. 

Its possible - 2nd point would likely reason  Yea, know people like pile Florida (sometimes justified, sometimes not) think everyone realizes close election was.  States immunization databases. They're usually maintained within state division public health, immunization section (or equivalent). data Israel shows 60% reduction severe disease 90+ 70% reduction 70-90. It‚Äôs still good, much lower high expectations following trials.

The people helped vaccine 50, seems reduction severe disease, even Delta many months inoculation. people need get vaccinated slow spread, people declining shot.

The trials representative whole population. current vaccination protocol doesn‚Äôt elicit sufficient antibodies 30% seniors 80, it‚Äôs likely higher delta variant. UK's low 5-6 deaths per day reported months ago. U.S. got \~230/day. U.S. started higher position. UK, fwiw, seen \~16x increase daily deaths reported. lot factors play, course, could get bad. I'm convinced people like OP trying shift blame vaccinated either care science want punish others, they're part anti-vax psyop. reason US mess enough people want vaccinated government refuses force them, that's it. dead also lifelong consequences choose two usually pretty straightforward. keep right demonstrating ignorance facts - May press release political forces pulled rug requiring START expanding trial twice already approved size.

The goalposts literally moved result already late September becomes like January.

Also, chance mutation eclipsing vaccine increases mix vaccinated people unvaccinated people. I‚Äôd actually say vaccinated American causing mutation evades vaccine likely scenario due polarity vaccine country CDC encouraging anyone vaccine party like it‚Äôs 2019 back May.

And one took COVID argument. fact, always COVID, particularly costs dangers unvaccinated creating others relative people make poor health decisions.

But expect illiterate understand that.

Fucking idiot, Jesus Christ. 95% take 5mins results. Found antimasker also trouble reading comprehension! really doubt calling unvaccinated Americans unAmerican cause get vaccinated. laughing you. 

They already flipping (metaphorically literally).  calling names wishing dead, listen you? March 2020 pre vaccine. Loss smell taste lasted like 10ish days. completely lost smell taste (not ‚Äúcouldn‚Äôt smell much‚Äù) time. came back seemed bit couple days went back normal. symptoms mild cleared quickly except brain fog lasted month.

Hopefully vaccine pass quickly smoothly you. talking federal government local governments? pull map see federal problem. mismanaged local level. state definitions reimplementing mandates one done thing. School started today also things going get better here. understand it, ""asymptomatic breakthrough"" bit oxymoron. Remember vaccination equal immune infection, point actually ""sick"", body taking care without really noticing. breakthrough describes someone vaccinated becoming sick enough show symptoms regardless, thereby ""breaking through"" body's defenses symptomatic. 

That said, ""infectious"" different question. Vaccines masks Fuck it! I'm self imposed lockdown. work home anyway I'm good. Y'all safe there, I'ma sit keep wife. Even experts surprised swerve pandemic taken. Delta, Andrew Noymer, public-health professor UC Irvine, wasn‚Äôt expecting significant resurgence virus‚Äîor need re-mask‚Äîuntil fall. 

I suspect one reason seeming hurry reopen summer exactly that: people expected resurgence virus happen around time happened last year (outside Sunbelt anyway), idea get started build immunity low levels next big wave. UK still this, high enough vaccine coverage get away (for now).

The optimistic way look maybe inescapable result opening things might look better fall last year. lot reasons believe true. make masking optional? school districts wasting tax payer money sides issue? governor mandating health. let hands. will. hate really can't shut again. tried right thing enough, mainly thanks misinformation politikool party went logic science.

Misleading headline. government working church try convince holdouts. may ask, comfortable sharing symptoms? familiar standard Covid symptoms (loss smell, headache, fatigue, flu symptoms) heard symptoms adults fully vaccinated like cold. Sneezy/runny nose/ etc. I'm kind concerned number kids adults getting even realize. Agree point problem years years letting people say whatever want, misinformation gained legitimacy ends elevated anyway without challenge.

I think antivax movement started, scientific/medical community pushed back HARD kind vaccine awareness campaign, would helped. might radicalized people already predisposed trusting things think would done good people fence.

Instead let smolder years slowly gain legitimacy point measles back lot way deep can‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre wrong without causing question everything else. impressive, yet still completely inadequate task. I'm vegan took vaccine. people leg stand wrong filled misinformation, actually shocked many people agree upvoting this.

The original vaccine distributed half population essentially stopped previous covid outbreak: cases declining nationwide spite fact many people refusing get vaccinated. reason decline lowering R0 value virus one, meaning person infected infecting one less one person.

Had fully vaccinated entire population one would getting last covid strain. What's actually worse, needed vaccinate 65 70% population essentially functionally eliminate covid-19 United States.

The current vaccine also still provides enough protection prevention infection reach goal, new variant much infectious need much higher percentage vaccinated individuals lower R0 value one lower again. people's unwilling nature get vaccine, need 85 90% population vaccinated stop covid-19 tracks again.

And start going people fully vaccinated getting sick, remind still occasionally getting breakthrough infection cases Delta variant spreading like wildfire. current vaccine still 75 80% effective preventing infection entirely amongst vaccinated population. even breakthrough cases get someone's vaccination causing incredibly mild symptoms whatsoever.

I feel like need remind everyone else reading one simple fact: vaccine 100% effective preventing infection. Period. getting herd immunity prevent virus spreading eventually replicate nothing. eliminated polio, smallpox, virtually tuberculosis, formally deadly infectious diseases. get point one, unfortunately going require lot work convince highly misinformed skeptical population right thing. long variant worse delta start spread, lockdowns highly vaccinated countries. leaving virtually vulnerable people vaccinated. seen anyone wearing mask weeks. Daily new cases rising. Forcing people mask right would nuts.  ""mild cases"" definition, need ICU bed, correct? THOUGHT still regular beds, running ICU beds. Orthodox Christians, though. Onion domes priests beards. Dunno view Luther.  Maybe maybe not. there‚Äôs still tons people putting kids daycare school. Daycares never closed down. Even half school year opened last year. I‚Äôm California one strict states. everyone stay home hide. Mortgage bills pay. send kids u go work?  state databases. Someone correct I'm wrong. Breakthrough cases likely asymptomatic.

They reduce likelihood infection, also reduce severity symptoms. However people breakthrough cases shown much viral load regular unvaccinated cases. difference two far contagiousness goes amount viral shedding, sneezing, coughing, spitting etc.   Article answer article says.

Impressive. Let's hope trend continues. That's article says. article says discharged told hydrate, later mentions people attacking unvaccinated, turned away unvaccinated.

It seems like first hospital assumed dehydrated, second hospital picked 02 levels. Raw dogging air.

Also lot idiots moving Fl avoid covid restrictions elsewhere. DeSantis prolife tho Polish x girlfriend I'm angry antivaxers ICU nurse. Antivaxer?

Start fining people masking up. people properly masked, breakthrough infections would dramatically decrease IMO. 

Allowing people throw tantrum masking like giving 4 year old screaming eat ice cream. Sometimes, got adult people making wise decisions affect everyone.

Also... I'm real hard time believing people cannot wear mask. far people legitimately unable vaccinated (autoimmune diseases, immunosuppressed people, etc). Get ass clinic get dose science injected arm. glad did. Basically ""no, you"" argument. Covid well might cause lung damage kids. No... masks, for... reasons.

Pro-choice parents choose parents, pro-life parents get stuck it. Masks work.

In eyes, real world application masks theater.   opinion change proposition Americans. Americans, traitors, thats fact. think problems vaccine mandates it‚Äôs currently emergency use authorization. Takes extra 4 months (which now) health safety data get full authorization. 

Once get full authorization, think mandates put place. example, requiring schools, military, health staff. Currently, nurse, required get flu shot, wear mask entire season. full auth, could mandate vax weekly covid tests pocket. 

For schools, every state religious philosophical exceptions. already given student vacations, becomes lot harder justify. 

Colleges mandating now.

It‚Äôs become predictable unfortunately less disappointing.   easy paint one's adversaries intentionally sowing chaos, disruptive, absurdly frivolous, usually sign understand them. people heroes stories act (misguided) good intentions. prefer think prisoners unfalsifiable epistemologies. disease mind us suffer from.

""do nothing"" scenario. two pandemics pretty comparable, except time vaccine ... half population reluctant take bizarre reason. Same. want humanity destroyed. aren‚Äôt worth it. Thats wonderful school. choice public school private religious schools even less controls. legislators fail pass funding virtual option &amp; governor banned mask mandates. least kids old enough vaccinate. I'm hoping delta burns county summer natural immunity higher think. point, comes alternative reality class Americans, getting feel like necessary suffering thing *might* help pull heads ass. course forces unnecessary deaths onto rest forced coddle raving idiocy.

I really really hope, reality handful individuals entities arguably bare sole responsibility poisoning societal well, get lost coming rapids. It'd nice became clear knowingly, gleefully, nefariously disseminating unending flood toxic bullshit tolerated modern civil society. 

Sadly means likely won't. noxious misanthropes like Tucker empty Greene face grave consequences rhetoric earn, bet able fix shit.

Sure survey data percentages there. debate that. that's also earth shattering. Blacks 2% reported Repiblicans 1%. big deal. 

But clue race 40% vaccinated people? Yeah. That's data support view, must wrong.

No, I'm pointing actual potential issues data. Issues probably even realize could exist, right? mean, tell I'm wrong here. already investigative work find 40 states better job CDC race info?

They're hard avoid, yet real lots people want dismiss poster seems imply analogy. Imagine thinking Google tell truth. wish could naive that.. really üòÇ Again, think we're unreasonably lumping different types long-haul symptoms. kids regularly get snotty nose lasts 4 weeks viral infection. counts long-haul disease studies, doubt many people worried that.

So we're really worried PARTICULAR SUBSET long-haul symptoms significantly impact quality life. stated original comment, that's 0.7% age 2-11, age groups little higher. Let's call 1% everybody. think self-reporting inflates figures. Going 4 million figure chickenpox, 40,000 debilitating long-haul symptoms. 35,000 die year car accidents, think risk comparable.

We suspect number viruses cause chronic autoimmune terrible conditions small percentage people. virus magic. end day, think covid long-haul percentages match others. Another gold medal Team USA üá∫üá∏ üëè Mutations, recombination. A+C=D teach 5th grade it‚Äôs strange attending trainings planning meetings right now. moving forward it‚Äôs going completely normal (small groups, hands learning‚Ä¶). However, time required take zoom/virtual learning trainings. 
The elephant room taking lot space. 

*bangs head table* money mean order? Delta variant less harmful ol regular one less 0.9% rough time even less.

Go live, stop afraid. Kids always dying, they're dying larger numbers there's getting infected. nurse Facebook Friends list vaccinated, COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates health care workers. ready true plot twist? also advocate climate change, calls people ""science deniers"" denying climate change. I've never seen blatant cherry-picking life. 

Can someone rescue United States America(USA)? can't handle dumpster-fire country anymore. know someone supposed start teaching Thursday. They're vaccinated - spent entire weekend hanging someone tested positive yesterday. refusing get covid test afraid messing return school. Okay yeah, fair. stupid use BMI things like two vaxxed adults assuming comorbidities, go it. Three unvaxxed littles, going bad Covid hotspot? Hard pass. I‚Äôd wait surge dies down. fully vaccinated (Pfizer). Caught COVID around July 27, began developing mild symptoms July 29 began isolating. August 4, almost symptoms apart taste/smell loss. Tested negative rapid antigen August 5, August 6, August 7. Left isolation yesterday (August 8).

Today (August 9) woke sore throat took rapid antigen POSITIVE. possible!? Could false positive due lingering fragments viral load? We're number 1, we're number 1! lets open schools open flood gates. 

All btw money reasons. 100% greed school districts, local state governments. one willing go session change schools given funds currently based physical attendance. Sort of. cells crank proteins fast, actually make virus faster, since spike protein made, virus chances bind ACE2 receptors leading faster infection faster increase virion population. exactly chemical act replication happens faster. Think like zombies zombie infection bite zombie speed, one zombies jump run, infect people infect people making total population increase faster rate walking zombies. know try keep *crash bed*, least one free bed, per unit.  Neck Gaiters safe doubled per CDC Guidance.  won‚Äôt job much longer lol universe something ""only"" killing 500 kids one year good comparison FINALLY goddamn peace quiet. /s 

I though thing bit. What‚Äôs / who‚Äôs Sandy hook?  shut down? scared positive result? Growing I‚Äôve taught safety always top priority anything else. Florida guess it‚Äôs able see someone‚Äôs smile. Ridiculous. We‚Äôve 2 years prepare. shouldn‚Äôt OK hospitals run space time. I'm pretty certain mean right now, writing. Perhaps billionaire using funds space vacations, could accelerate research programs... deleted comment comment right, that's insane claim anyone making. Even though know originate still quoted.

In addition others said, part danger Measles also actual number infections one source vary lot patients regardless population reproductive number. Thank much comment. exactly kind rational discussion world needs. appreciate took time write this. Thanks. keep denying obvious. I‚Äôm sorry. go issues. seeking help professionals good. I‚Äôm hoping sort medical breakthrough address issues found. Join support group please. Please take care. Yes, many sick people can't get vaxxed, including kids.  would agree.

On discussions I've mask effectiveness, usually end trying explain risk management instead, difference global personal risk.

Even masks 5% effective, would still huge impact R number densely populated areas.

You could wear mask, get vaccine, wash hands, stay lockdown still get corona, could non things get corona. 
It's really protection personal level, people generally understand. people got vaxxed, wore masks

I caught alpha variant wearing N95 mask (or local equivalent). delta really contagious, masks may enough.

I've also read accounts vaccinated people catching it, may exceptions. USA USA USA! First Olympics, first COVID. Suck balls world. Ya ain‚Äôt first yer last There'll there's big uptick hospitalizations deaths due new variant causing lot breakthrough infections vaccinated. event planners, organizers, security personal, AV Techs, musicians, vendors lost $ potentially careers cancelled?

Cancelling events isn‚Äôt good everyone. sucks lot working class people numbers convince them, minds made up- logic necessary.  school preschool 8th, kids vaxxed, none she‚Äôd interact with. We‚Äôre also starting IVF Kid #2, point feel it‚Äôs risky baby, we‚Äôll keep home. least school transparent warning everyone early. Masks, hot lunch served, buses, field trips, parents inside, distanced classroom setups, mandatory quarantines exposure. Completely agree. Give parents waiver option today waiting many months EUA Pfizer ages 5-11. Thousands kids would vaccinated week. bad Publix Florida. Maybe missed it, seems like studies protect spreading disease others, anything wearing mask protecting wearer?

I definitely continue wear mask public (never stopped), pretty disheartening think mask protecting public around necessarily protecting public.  Nope. travel. you‚Äôre saying found legal way get rid family. 

(Not sure need /s, case, is.) Actually, clearly connected social issue. someone‚Äôs wages go 5$ apartment goes 500$ month, wage increase means little. find bit surprising can‚Äôt see connection. people don‚Äôt understand wish lockdowns social distancing forever. big sector working class minorities (black &amp; Hispanic) work events &amp; hospitality.

Not everyone job work home, depend live entertainment put food table families. depressing.. jobs people know made career People idea vague feeling ""tested"" enough ""we know yet"" - emotion, reason overwhelming majority.  


They're afraid, they're afraid someone told afraid. essentially true Alpha variant, longer Delta.  


These parents behind times, unvaccinated die. people. I‚Äôve heard people near got I‚Äôll. you‚Äôre worried take Friday minimize risk. 

Sucks don‚Äôt get take sick days though. fucking sad, children paying stupidity adults. Get vaccinated fucks sake, wear fucking mask. That‚Äôs awesome, thanks fir sharing can't read slides - know reason effectiveness low infection symptoms length since vaccination, fact elderly vaccinated early on, both?

I mean, must populations vaccinated early, health care workers - also seeing low efficacy six months out? Probably kids exposed two year, plus coughing cases corralled Covid tent. things go poorly incompetence, things go well luck. Yep, that's recommended vaccinated wear masks. got moderna vaccine too. healthcare workers area got moderna. Glad wasn‚Äôt bad you!! :) Classmate dying wouldn‚Äôt happened statistically speaking. studies show least beta: children don‚Äôt really get virus nearly rate adults children transmit virus nearly rate adults do. *Just Maybe* need. one gave shit Polio saw kids suffering. Hey you, wanting kids currently cup tea tho had/have OCD Covid always train thought. would one taking day coworkers came sick, instead reverse. Covid hit, people worried mental health, crazy seems, equipped anyone. masks, gloves, disinfectant, knew navigate. course ended taking toll initial lockdown, still does, boy vindicating first lol.

And wondering i've sought help, treatment type OCD extremely unaffordable (they told parents sell house get second jobs). pandemic, many professionals restructure treat contamination OCD due real threat covid actually possesses, i'm dealing little little own. We‚Äôre number 1! We‚Äôre number 1! 

USA! USA! USA! Hmm wonder store can't find decent new hires $10 /s know what‚Äôs fucked up? children dying STILL won‚Äôt change mind anti vaxxers. way equally flawed statements? saying something work needs work 100% efficacy?! definitely true. True, enough. Worked Australia dealing anti-vaxers. Abbott DeSantis liked would thought anti-maskers would rigid thinking. know else prone rigid thinking? mentally ill.

Of course, say mentally ill anti-maskers, truth lot mentally ill actually empathetic care others, say mental illness may well component makes anti-masker make judgements make. told could still go accomplish tasks outside stores completely naked?

Shouldn't government allow everyone naked matter go?

Why not? government forcing us cover God-given genitals?

Oh, that's right, wearing clothes huge deal. Neither wearing mask. symptoms? grandmother (it took months convince get vaccinated) suffers terrible headaches years now. day vaccine told potentially expect headache, that's experienced mine. response headaches scare her, time learned live them.

3 months later blames vaccine terrible headaches. 9 10 dentists kinda statement. stopped believing science? Really? Based showing center gravity large cruise ships pretty low, container weighs much normal house boat+house together, puts center gravity way higher.  mention roof line house boat solid steel light weight materials, designed support 5+ containers weighing 80,000lbs top them, they're designed couple people.

So yes, ship tall example, weight low ship, engines fuels low theaters restaurants mostly open areas, like explained video. changing events change. weatherman tells sunny today, think he's contradictory two weeks raining, right? We‚Äôre guessing rest stop, cafe grocery visit Florida. We‚Äôve ultra vigilant socially distancing pretty good masking unknown crowds ‚Äúnormal‚Äù things. 20-30% kind mask? really frustrating initial panic everyone like ""any mask better nothing"" somehow topic never really came again, people stuck surgical cloth masks even though better ones widely available again. 
 
If seeing less 50% protection well fit N95/FFP2/KN masks serious possibility fomite transmission starting play bigger role people get sloppy handling potentially contaminated masks. big part concern recommending public masking first place.  ""Everything know pandemic learned Tucker Carlson."" true.

Only Impossible plant-based heme, considered ‚Äúnew‚Äù ingredient. 

Others never needed contain ‚Äúnew‚Äù ingredients. result, many vegans eat Impossible products don‚Äôt consider vegan, others eat believe cost lives outweighed animal lives product potential save.

I don‚Äôt eat it‚Äôs way realistic grosses out. prefer Beyond like taste better, didn‚Äôt animal testing.  belief 100% based reality. cops useless scum. misleading. stop wearing seatbelt, don‚Äôt lock doors, walk around downtown night flashing expensive jewelry, right? 

Or‚Ä¶ could take common sense precautions reduce risk dying. feeling Abbott's bluff masks schools going cut ways. ""Abbott puts politics children's health"" attack ads write themselves. Ah yes, massive tome ""sayings chairman tRump..."" teacher figure install 9 volt battery one cheap things mentioned. cover open, get clip in...because flip around...They thought shapes lined / same. another one thought red dot go tongue. favorite told go around replace dozens batteries (for reason none found dead) found temp checker still wrapped plastic. offered open install battery teacher said waste time marked everyone normal sheet everyday. several teachers know temp supposed taken forehead top head. wearing hats another one asked. put dot cheek chin?

I hope things better district, certainly beating virus laser pointers. Seat belts air bags 100% either, bet they're using them! basic that, never trust anyone says 99.99%.

It's telegraphing 1) true stats back comment 2) leaving cya 0.01% anything happens, say 100%

When somebody comes says ""it's 97.23%"" willing give statement thought. also really fuzzy Covid primary admission reason, they're testing every kid comes everything prevent spread, finding Covid (symptomatic not). decided kids affected bad gonna last line, expect? wet dream people civil war 100% indicates never seen war privileged, circle jerk lives. Traitors. rapid test result effective available (like saliva test), put use catch case, send kid home lunchtime? parent, would definitely prefer nothing masking. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I disagree rich districts ""pay into"" Poor districts, typically good portion tax revenue goes state coming back districts.

So even though, say, Austin resident pays $1000 taxes $200 goes Austin schools, still going state first makes Austin school districts, no? guarantee toy jungle gym sent 85 kids one state hospital one day would nationwide recalls lawsuits.

Your logic faulty. Indeed. 1 death even better, zero deaths, would totally happy since means controlled it. 4 deaths implies might undercounted cases. Yeah, great job! first week allowing visitors, rules bit improvised, fiancee never felt less welcome, decisions made totally sensible.

Having (nearly) every day huge comfort, especially glad hospital's billing department called (short-term amnesiac, looped kinds drugs) first business day admission, demanding pay full remaining balance deductible. mean ... god. position deal myself. know what, bad. 

I mean, can't even understand higher percentages kids getting sick mean longer least likely demo get sick. earth expect understand conclusions science change new evidence, changes virus, considered. 

These contradictions, science science does. Evolve topics better information comes in. Exactly right. Also, children become likely represent larger percent hospitalizations adults vaccinated. simply b/c children largest unvaccinated population. 12s vaccinated hospital numbers likely go way way down. question masks work.

N95 goggles, essentially 100% even Covid wards. Otherwise, would shut doctors nurses become sick Covid.

There many studies show masks works. ouch... sobering point... I‚Äôm doctor I‚Äôm passing along trusted doctor life said‚Ä¶.however, would think number people suffering ‚Äúlong Covid‚Äù months even 1+ year would odds statement ‚Äúonce it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

2/ 500,000 thousand deaths trivial comparison numbers minimise WW2 veterans.
On point looking reason get offended.

3/ current rulers China don‚Äôt normally let citizens well-being get way profit.
Chinese citizens worked death literally name profit.
The leaders chosen shut large parts country cause massive economic damage stop/limit transmission Covid.

Is enough make stop think ?
What Chinese know don‚Äôt ?

Not matters giant real life experiment happening real time.

We get see outcomes different approaches management pandemic next decades. percent talking ""percent positive"" could make sense, case ambiguous technical composition. general, nobody ever use ""percent"" technical article. problem make up. heard media sources. sorts pseudoscience propagandized. I've also heard elderly people say exactly thing, completely unrelated father law. concerned certainty virus everything already data know basic fact. concerned pseudoscience ""possibilities"" future outcomes enough time know sure. Mask may cause future lung damage kids. teenage daughter able children time comes. Etc. etc. Delta *slightly* less contagious measles South Carolina governor morning said thinks media exaggerating covid he‚Äôs making kids wear masks school protect adults. doesn‚Äôt believe kids get sick covid apparently. came sub specifically focuses COVID articles complain articles focus significant news related COVID? 

The wildfires California aren‚Äôt problem aren‚Äôt issue Michigan? think non-vaxxers treated ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù get information randomly internet, highly credible sources allowed. could biased towards scientifically provable facts. /s didn‚Äôt mean needed test wait hour starting school day. meant test week try don‚Äôt wait symptomatic cases start quarantining. still debate fucking ludicrous. Humanity doomed.  Huh, wrong. ex lived burbs wad incredibly red. Guess city different. really going sit watch unvaccinated put kids vulnerable greater danger? Fuck people. think we're point pandemic blanketly avoid social gatherings, depending big are, there, inside vs outside, knowingly vaccinated people, etc. days physical isolation society still here.

The masks appear still needed much inside last year. Get fuck out?! Third similar second actually went better. Really sore arm, headache, exhausted. able go normal routine bit crankier usual. history covid. close friend mine children one body bare convinced youngest daughter developed seizures wearing masks, plot twist large majority children neurological issues resulting seizures inherited her! She‚Äôs diagnosed epileptic since met 12 years old‚Ä¶but know MASKS! effectively say saying ""masks work"" ""masks work"" equally incorrect. maybe argue ""masks work"" oversimplification definitely incorrect ""masks work"" definitely incorrect.

You going ridiculous series defining terms phrases liking. point terms productive. comment responded closing mask discussion conclusion ""masks work"".  nd mind definition whether something works. work well enough worth cost it? works. reach threshold work. principle could apply pretty much every thing life.

Good agreement. everyone uses phrases same. \*analogy\*. Would like link definition? here, Biden leader USA, him, organization, outside individuals businesses, put much effort making vaccines available widely quickly possible.

For remedial, analogy, water represents vaccines.

Now, comes Citizens. hope might understand represented horses analogy. important, horses drink water, not. goal exercise focus drink water. sorta kinda represent Citizens refuse take vaccine.

So, make easier understand.

""Biden led effort make vaccine available citizens, can't make take shot""

Hence, using analogy horse water...

""One lead horse water, can't make drink""

If use powerful thing known ""your imagination"", might become clear you. American Academy Pediatrics sent letter FDA demanding quit fuckery, acknowledge biological plausibility serious side effects 2+ months post vaccine, authorize damn vaccines 12s.

Lord knows listen though.  Sorry, thought article aggregate side effects, per person basis üòã care contradicts? information changes, research gets done evaluated, re-evaluated...that's shit suppose work. someone wrong better say they're wrong keep lying save face. Agreed privileged position anyone truly vulnerable household. days I‚Äôm grateful grandmother respiratory issues passed shortly COVID became blowout crisis 2019. 3/4 breakthrough seniors. bet almost remaining various underlying conditions.

These vaccines proven phenomenal, especially Moderna, Pfizer AZ. Well, yes. could chosen take no-holds-barred approach like Ebola something quite deadly enough warrant level response. vaccinated otherwise healthy get community spread health system danger, dangerous flu. old, immunocompromised, unvaccinated, etc stay concern, like flu. point life go back normal accept Covid exists world. still need vaccines mask wearing get point without overstressing health care system. cold flu, symptoms happen days almost soon infected, know social distance/stay home

""Why miss whole day work/pto/pay? little cold. hurt you!"" - jerk came work cold gave everyone else.

Never mind employers fire people calling sick. know NK actually outbreak? They're country would believe covid never reached, given insulated are. also: Covid doesn‚Äôt kill children like flu b city Dallas Republican.
Not century, least. 

Dem mayor
Dem county judge (the county‚Äôs CEO, basically)
Dem DA
Dem Sheriff
Dems hold 3 US House seats 8/11 State Senate seats
Dems hold elected county Judge seats
Dems hold 8/10 JP seats

There like 4-5 elected Republicans entire county. 


The northern burbs red. predictable. states lowest vaccination numbers seeing highest number new cases highest number new deaths. Louisiana around 30 deaths day, half peak April, 2020. cases continuing increase Delta taking over, LA may first state start deaths post-vaccine pre-vaccine. children's hospitals filling across south. Covid already starting hit kids states posted.  states starting rise according charts linked. mean Covid run around willy-nilly.   asshole spreader.

Things bad enough south make states ""success"".  states realize coming. know say: ""Safety third!""  Selfish brainwashed?

Before covid think would ignorance. think people would seen someone wearing mask thought protect mask wearer, everyone else. call major bullshit, mother grandmother vaccinated currently hospital struggling. vaccine starting seem bullshit every day. lol shocking want Abbott, DeSantis asked tough questions. Like supposed help children learn funds reduced? Come ooooooon San Antonio. Fuck Abbott, right thing.  US, go get it. Lots people waiting going states mom pop pharmacies. ton people makes sense. never scared getting covid I‚Äôm youngish healthy - yes chance outlier getting sick numbers always incredibly low.

But got vaccine absolute first chance could return travel work toward moving on. bills pay, it‚Äôs simple. Rent, gas, food, insurance, whatnot. job retail can‚Äôt afford work. sure research done. read back reason large portion population China near sightedness kids, grew less time spent outdoors/in sun looking things away, focus studies indoors/up close (regardless screen paper). optical functions kind atrophies. required deployable. one willfully breaking federal law force people get anthrax vaccine, especially early 2000s needed everyone could get. sure hope so. largest districts provide sort precedent smaller districts follow.  makes perfect sense military readiness perspective. high school, friend joined Marines. got back basic asked was. said standing line giving inoculations large array stuff basically stuck arm got something injected you. asked getting injected CO came over, punched gut told fucking job top ask questions. Imagine people started finding wearing jacket cold weather offensive started going around confronting people wearing jackets lol.  thing would change mind serious re-infection. it‚Äôs mild going worry body what‚Äôs expected. see breakthrough cases understand difference think missing point.

We lots evidence theory support idea masks help. (at least I've seen) good evidence *how much* help. 

It's true masks relatively low-cost intervention, costless. weigh costs vs. benefits policies mask mandates (particularly vaccinated), it'd nice better understanding strong benefits Well, measles much contagious dangerous, especially kids.

Good know something like already implemented. There's chance all. lol exactly :(  Please, Houston, exact thing. enough areas give Abbott big F-U, going hard overturn them. Anyone else finding really hard know what's true lately? far pandemic I've managed keep solid thumb mainstream news sources getting right wrong. Delta throwing everything disarray. Ask question Delta, get like three different sets facts. ""long covid kids"" article NYT really hit today; thought, god, maybe I've wrong Covid kids. Maybe I'm asshole thinking fine send school. hop onto Twitter Nate Silver retweets expert saying NYT article irresponsible exaggeration can't even get causation/correlation right, comments, people calling Nate expert irresponsible assholes. ???

And splitting mostly liberal tribe pro-mask, pro-vaccine folks vicinity. loudest friends insist callous prick wearing mask right now, walk around liberal small city mask wearing scant-to-none unless store specifically asks wear mask.

All reality checks breaking down. Anyone insight help out? people really even trying remote learning? see people using temporary solutions foolishly expected now.  explain calculation works? remember baby Feb 2020 thinking interesting doctors nurses handling newborn wearing masks. think might've saved life? Imagine successful enough move whole family 2000 miles, also stupid don‚Äôt let kids wear masks inside public buildings. Boggles mind work seeing large amounts breakthrough infections closing office

You'll close office indefinitely still possible people get inefected elsewhere. developed adult onset asthma result getting H1N1 (swine flu). don‚Äôt know people don‚Äôt understand even things don‚Äôt hospitalize still cause long-lasting health issues. evidence this. UK went Delta surge children schools large scale deaths children. US (especially South) seeing incredibly high case rates (far eclipsing time pandemic accounting less testing), children affected. TIL: Florida nation's yard Normally, times, would ‚Äòflu seasons‚Äô virus would characteristically somewhat rapidly infect schools. Since low mortality rates, never need stop this. Well, Covid, may two three expected waves stifled lockdowns mask mandates. didn‚Äôt barely flu cases past winter. we‚Äôre opening up, waves kicking time. 

Imagine forgot check email year. Instead handling one two emails day, get overwhelmed 500-600 emails once, many might significant. reflection constituents. People love say politicians suck reflection people put power. interesting, thanks write up. basically kids usually ""practice"" RSV, seeing lot kids get first exposure it, getting severe infections? kid thrived distance learning. truly enjoyed involved. Parenting matters connected short-order cooks‚Äô wages. in-laws wear masks required. vaccinated. spouse people know vaccinated wear masks thought-out choice required (which anymore around here).

I remember people wearing masks, wearing improperly, stuck like sore thumbs. feel sense comraderie people see still wearing masks public, 99.9% wear correctly. I‚Äôm skeptical takes couple weeks figure whether children get *X* variant COVID die it. either die don‚Äôt, far haven‚Äôt (praise Lord). sure wouldnt go Give death rate per population gtfo

When comparing unequal populations percentage deaths means little

if 100% people vaccinated, 100% deaths would vaccinated people... exactly. girlfriend got covid yesterday trying get vaccine. areas around last appointment five pm works car. asked boss could get early get vaccinated (especially since works daycare) boss laughed. covid boss mad asked provide proof three times accepted wouldn‚Äôt coming work. read first article said nothing back up. begging people get vaccinated. Yes breakthrough infections happen, vaccinated people still get infected much lower rate unvaccinated people get infected produce less virus. Meaning much less chance mutation.

You obviously cannot interpret data please leave people listen them. Exactly. Something similar introduced Denmark back April (or thereabouts) worked fine. Last heard, 21% beds occupied covid patients. 483*.21 = 101.3. We‚Äôd 100 beds weren‚Äôt covid admissions. That‚Äôs 15% beds occupied covid patients threshold manageable admissions. country close China, direct flights Wuhan start pandemic, recognized politics. sure great. Honestly, bother?  people would need care stories make difference get vaxxed put mask on, exact people care kids killed schools bc want 37 rifles. Repubs give single fuck kids dying. never will. Selfish pieces shit. amount kids dying hospitalized would make care. None. number Uhm, matter. that‚Äôs huge way spreads drastically reduce infections masks. 

People need understand principles play here. still go places uptight everyone masks someone speaking room take mask do, completely going science. Similarly, awhile people deathly afraid theaters despite known spread indoor restaurants getting open up, course much spread coming them. Sitting massive room 2 hours one talks preferable smaller room tons people coming every hour loudly talking without mask. 

We‚Äôre well year protocols place lot us aren‚Äôt page fight this. Terrifying. We're lucky daughter turned 12 end July started vaccines. She'll fully vaccinated second week school. 

My nephew staring preschool year. medically complex genetic disorder. I'm worried him. RSV years ago hospitalized week. know special Ed teachers vaccinated wearing masks, still scary. ride bus unvaccinated children wearing masks can't tolerate them. knows families taking seriously. hard decision make, needs school help development. already lost last year therapists.  Yeah, followed thread. seem interested dunking ‚Äúmorons‚Äù actually reasonable discussion around pretty fucking nuanced topic.

Your solution seems hard line in-person learning due Delta right now. That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôd love hear risk analysis calculations here. many deaths hospitalizations willing allow order permit in-person learning? easy, passionate answer ‚ÄúNone - every child‚Äôs death illness tragedy prevent.‚Äù reality it‚Äôs simple. 

COVID us while. know that. hopefully get kids 12 vaccinated degree, people get natural immunity hard way, it‚Äôll still around. Perhaps new strain next year even year. luckily, moment, kids still least affected group COVID far. 

But let‚Äôs say want safe side keep kids isolated another school year, maybe another that, COVID is, purposes example, eliminated entirely. still flu illnesses kill equivalent number kids per year. eliminate distance learning fixed? school shootings? 51 people killed injured school shootings 2019. agree tragedy well, wouldn‚Äôt happened in-person learning. stay remote fix that?

Obviously, could continue example take wild extremes wouldn‚Äôt beneficial talk about, that‚Äôs problem extreme takes: aren‚Äôt useful applicable real world, nuance context exist. 

Right now, lots people trying weigh pros cons creating positive social learning environment kids vs. worldwide pandemic statistically affect child serious ways, likely not. Saying there‚Äôs one easy solution makes think experience children parents, let alone teacher. cost getting science Internet. Liar Apology? They‚Äôll never apologize they‚Äôll actually find way blame democrats someone else.

These people completely detached reality point they‚Äôre deep can‚Äôt admit they‚Äôre wrong everything else believe would fall apart too. missed entire spike last couple months cases hundreds? $15 still slave wages  unable find small and/or extra small ones would fit children. thought (-) RNA viruses recombine, much rarer (+) RNA retroviruses. also go work feeling kinda achey. worked night shift nurse days got shot. second dose kinda sucked worth imo  We‚Äôve got lot hefty hefty hefty people Texas. dry nose effect covid test results? Rip. Sad made bad choice. key though parents understand facts. 1 year old going send daycare 1 year olds, unprotected covid. Cleaning hurt prevent getting covid. kid old enough wear mask, risk significantly lower.

This pediatricians NASA-grade air filtration systems sick rooms well rooms. kid room sick kid 7 hours day, they're getting sick. Parents misled thinking lysol solves problem doesn't. Thanks correction sometimes mean say Tuskegee experiment mind automatically jumps airmen. Well take long percent ""masked up"" chin diapers, nose explorers old shoe sock masks/kenny south park hoodies/bandanas? Texas governor right now. wearing masks Republican gatherings Trump wearing masks even getting covid? sure left hesitant everyone hesitant vaccines never developed fast. least Trump wear mask &amp; tell others would avoided. Wait, Alabama losing season? ;) ^ guy academics. must one amazing Sunday church service. fully vaccinated friend reported feeling sick travelling Texas visit family. telehealth visit doctor said probably covid. got tested ended negative. 

Vaccines still work. Really? Literally every job post ive seen last couple weeks around $10-12 hr. studio apartments starting $900-1000 rent. Wheres rule speak apply? seems like recruiters openly racist ignoring high BMI white people. BMI useless medical setting  Yep already wear those/KF94/N95, pretty much whatever get hands on. I‚Äôm seeing way many breakthroughs circles concern. Honestly, don‚Äôt even bother. People don‚Äôt want hear it. literally got vaccinated still ‚Äúpresident‚Äù little nothing convince them. 
Delta leading pandemic high case rates south despite vaccines. unvaccinated, case rates much higher ever. includes children. cases children means hospitalizations, evidence risk profile changed. effect teachers students dying preventable disease, kid‚Äôs school/classroom? Would worth risk/reward vs temporary change/pause learning? former teacher, understand losing year learning good. I‚Äôm sure experiencing trauma teacher classmate dying better. *would* happened plenty school usual. Yeah? so. Explain. Im sure question asking million times, people fully vaccinated: still wear mask? New England great place live. That's exactly area live. county 15 percent vaccination rate eligible populations, I've gone back grocery pickup trying best convince rest vaccinated family mask go anywhere. I'm sorry granddad middle this. People selfish. Email local stats professors article; they‚Äôll tell intentionally misleading its‚Äô presentation. seriously can‚Äôt stop chuckling fact said think people ever smart enough learn thing Greek alphabet. Like yo, country, many people believe sun actually revolves around earth.  **horrifying** standard disease prevention become political weapon.

For good reason, mandated vaccines schools since 1920s. public schools mandate chickenpox vaccine crying loud.  It‚Äôs majority clean house.

Yes, significantly better mask! something said talking history medicine high school, think talking lifespan population. 30 years ago, remember talking doctors using filthy tools childbirth aprons reason clean them, grubby apron kind like advertisement walking around, filthy seeing patients better doctor line thinking. also remeber saying poor women survived since couldnt afford doctors got less infections, least standard births  Added. People sub really wanted beleive getting vaccinated marked end pandemic

It did, them. rich nations vaccine available. overwhelming majority cases, severe COVID, fault.

COVID vaccinated orders magnitude less dangerous myriad dangers take seriously.

The ship sailed well year ago actually ending COVID. stay. pose significant danger vaccinated. Reinfections rare, observed many times. I‚Äôve read, immunity getting covid similar effectiveness immunity getting vaccine No, citizen permanent resident :
""August 9: American citizens permanent residents United States, currently reside United States, meet specific criteria qualify fully vaccinated""

It's September 7 others, I'm one person, went concert last Fri. Main stage ""outdoors"" lot venue get around covered. Kind in-between. crowd packed, friends 6+ hours, thought sure going test positive Covid despite vaccinated preparing worst. Went get test late day 4 ""exposure"" (following CDC recommendations) test came back negative. Never symptoms. know there's small chance could still test positive afterward, helped cement fact vaccines work. I'm gonna first line back crowded show, I'm least much ease masking going grocery store. incentives normal life, people seemed fuck one up.  necessarily. Agreed. bought ""Air Queens"" online they're pretty nice. Lightweight filter well. I'm pretty sure they're South Korea. pedantic argue unsourced speculation goes current knowledge covid works. think months exposure death, onus provide reliable medical/scientific basis it. exist. digging heels refusing consider made statement without evidential support. Traitors gonna betray. exaggerated. Third wave often worst wave pandemic. Killing young healthy without co-morbitities; underlying conditions remain unvaccinated fairing worst. That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôm doctor don‚Äôt know condition. certainly folks can‚Äôt safely get vaccine due wxisting conditions, everyone can, should. everything full, kick someone unit put someone else in. patient bed they've got they're discharged die. correct vaccine primarily prevents serious illness death. Infection possibility. think misunderstand cytokine storm. seems suggesting principal cause serious illness Covid. seen nothing literature support assumption.   think HISD going route People make argument voters forget atrocities election time comes. 

I posit it'll quite hard forget time around. next year, people lost loved ones highly preventable disease.

I choose believe they'll make right call. know article referring says ""most vaccine side effects occur 2-3 months vaccination?""  read former guy considering letting virus rip country without mitigation measures all, basis we'd reach herd immunity quicker (even meant many deaths)? surprise one bit DeSantis adopted plan state. Dude, 1B doses produced product approved 8 months ago huge accomplishment live California almost everyone kept wearing masks indoors, even mandate lifted. Since positivity rate super low, we've planned road trip Zion national parks kids. soon hit Utah knew Delta contained - literally ZERO mask usage, full restaurants, low vaccination rates, people looking funny us wearing masks. 

Came back last week, quarantined tested Covid - negative thankfully - I'm angry whole situation - could GOP make political issue? madness! Unless exposed, Apples &amp; Oranges received booster part Pfizer trial last week. side effects pronounced first shot less second. arm pain, lump injection site, fatigue joint pain. 103 degree fever headache came second shot. all, bad. hope Tarrant County follows suit, little conservative here. Still enough concerned parents. important COVID-deniers anti-vaxxers use example us ""twisting facts"" ""making numbers"". ‚ÄúBut personal feelings, valid science‚Äù Yes, tyranny requiring sound public health...

Just like need license drive public roads.

Existing public spaces pandemic rages protected constitution. Vaccine mandates new fully legal circumstances like this. Stop pretending mask mandate enough huge non-compliance last year alone.

Vaccine mandates insurers employers direction go. Along requiring vaccine passports public spaces. really care like not. question science reducing avenues transmission fast possible. time. India fucking fact garbage video posted positive like dislike video disgusting. Especially since every single CDC video videos promoting vaccines gets bombed dislikes. thoughts exactly J&amp;J vaxxed here...PLEASE GIVE SECOND SHOT! work school I'm nervous.

Anonymously forward picture boss. Doesn‚Äôt seem complicated honest. people vaccinated UK get proof via NHS app scan French covid pass Bluffing.  


As boards enter, impossible win situation worst Governor country. needs fire himself. Reddit user commented thread falsifying COVID-19 vaccination cards, saying, part, ‚ÄúI need one, too, college. refuse guinea pig.‚Äù

Why get fake College degree, Reddit user? also consider newer variants cause re-infections months later. But, general natural immunity thru infection &amp; recovery provides good deal protection short term. Note studies suggest ppl get least one dose either Pfizer Moderna increased immunity. Totally distress going cause future respiratory issues children get older. bet kids masked private schools. ""willing"" victims. Getting vaccine reward enough me. really delay inevitable?

I friends family work healthcare children young vaccinated. fact dealing people who've made conscious choice everything power protect virus puts children risk.

Oh actually photos ancestors Palermo moved here. always one things wanted honor grandfather. tried look passed.  Yes. baby home currently pregnant Anyone doubting try blowing candle wearing mask. Oxygen molecules pretty tiny btw.  friend totally liberal said would wait ""2.0"" vaccine. wait long caught visiting Florida. even reservations eventually got mine thankful ever since.

Bunch pedophiles want see children's faces again. Ah, see saying. fun part we're even sure casualty rate covid yet, know there's least people long-term disability due it, intuition tells probably least 1.2 million; basing notion deadly conditions tend cripple least many kill. But, obviously that's first-order approximation subject modification data could go either way.

Which, course, means comparison wars apt. Ok. never said could bypass completely. Delta already showing vaccine might enough stop spread. good job protecting symptoms/hospitalization perfect. also simply enough known virus know certainty vaccine protect possible variants sufficient degree. probably right way works means always provide level protection question much. top possibility variants make generally harmful currently vulnerable virus like young children.  need us get it, gotta hold airpods cases go up. opinion, fact. I'm sorry braindead realize that. second yesterday, side effects me. Egypt reported 16k coronavirus deaths. also 207k excess deaths. really possible country underreport death toll badly? important, mind?

This issue specifically highlighted one major talking points ‚Äúchildren aren‚Äôt impacted COVID.‚Äù evidence are, fact, impacted, you‚Äôre like ‚Äúfocus 26 possible cases instead everything else.‚Äù

What‚Äôs important kids getting seriously ill COVID seemingly-increasing rate, right school starting, less.

J &amp; J interesting there's indications long term T-Cell response may better mRNA ones. mRNA ones better boosting antibody counts, antibodies fade eventually T-Cells really show strength long term comes body knowing fight infection. They're incredibly impressive, worry much one get end.   can't think circumstances is. Usually exemptions granted due sincerely held religious belief medical reasons, cases employer may still require mandatory masking/testing. Also, vaccinated real goal. OP can‚Äôt keep card case parents find out, least know they‚Äôll lot safer.

OP - able get birth control without parental consent 17, look it. likely able get vaccinated without well. doesn‚Äôt mean Delta less dangerous variants.

If delta long tail infections, it‚Äôs going lower percentage even putting record numbers hospital.

The real question is: delta hospitalizing individuals wouldn‚Äôt hospitalized previous variants.

It makes optimistic cases start coming since states lower vaccination states already started coming down. guess worry would exactly far spike happens many deaths probably could avoided.

Thank you. Nonsense. post nothing kind. poster pointing means use counter anti-vax sentiment propaganda important.

NERVE, wow. friend's dad diagnosed widely metastasized cancer, stay ER overnight ICU beds him. gonna shitshow. Like said, risk zero. 400+ kids U.S. still much less historical flu/pneumonia numbers. Last year's flu bad measure everyone took precautions. 

As bad Covid is, ofc even 1 kid dying tragedy, society decide whether outweighs kids school. decades flu, pneumonia communicable diseases killed far 400 kids / year concluded that, unfortunate, educating kids important ok attend school.

Otherwise, alternative stunting education entire generation. 2nd Pfizer rekt, bedridden two days, lift arms head several more, etc etc. Good know expect even worse hellride, cuz I'm lining early. Definitely considering switching teams moderna, that's mostly efficacy never actual ""pro-life"" agenda. true ""pro-life"" agenda would fight abortion would also death penalty, getting vaccinated, making sure child died hunger, etc. stand for. conservatives rename stance ""pro-control"". want control everybody else. want control women's bodies outlawing abortion. want control people respond pandemic. want control entire political process prevent people able vote. solely control domination expense others. Would love elementary schools would use (or rapid testing) regular basis little kiddos could get vaccinated.  coworkers think masks oppression question safety glasses.  thing mandates follow them. Many schools workplaces require vaccination get expelled/fired. hospitals literally full, decision made: save life person normal weight, save life morbidly obese person, doubt mind let morbidly obese person die.

It different now. situations come often, do, real decisions made absolutely kind criteria decide by. 

I know vaccinated vs. unvaccinated enter point....I doubt due able easily (I presume) reliably establish real reason someone vaccinated. easy way determine that, let ""unvaccinated choice"" people die, absolutely, unequivocally. 

Seeing people literally swearing nurses doctors denying COVID, easy sort out. cynical minute here, ZERO doubt morons ""downgraded"" medical staff priority list shit hits fan, policy not. breakthrough cases vaccinated people aren‚Äôt causing end hospital like unvaccinated.  Stewardess? speak jive!  Right? Delta called Indian variant mind boggling. person 17 wants get vaccinated can't parents allow it, person screwed right? way get secretly vaccinated something? that's it, without individual accountability, collective. 

I disagree needs oversight governmental perspective. Education, suggestion recommendations gone far. guess struggle see done point going end armed riots; real world suggestion think work, spewing drivel online actual suggestions? good enough supply burned people eager get vaccinated. happen countries... Maybe countries less social media access though. Agreed. 

A better solution, one I've seen people suggest, insurance companies requiring vaccinated covering COVID related bills. would spur right thing, care fellow citizens, care bottom line (hospitalizations expensive fuck).

even scenario (vaccines offered universal mask mandate), plenty americans would disagree sacrificing liberties. fines work, talking police arrest people wearing masks. feel like ""liberty"" many americans define it.

at point gotta draw line sand makes collective sense.   help Macron announced *retirement fund reforms* time. That's (lava-)hot button topic. Hi, clarify means? tested negative several consecutive days I'm loss I'd positive almost two weeks (estimated) infection.

Do think related fragments viral load, I'm likely still COVID?

I currently symptoms, thought recovered four days already, know :( used 2.3x multiplier Delta. pretty standard here. sides vax fence, actually. Saying wasn‚Äôt still proceed caution favorable answer.

On 57th day, volunteers continue undergo physical examination take blood tests evaluation analysis team proposes third stage trials 1,000 volunteers./. vaccination certificate proving vaccinated? would worry tested got proof vaccinated? That's point pass... either vaccinated... means need tested... vaccinated negative test 48hrs ago max necessary enter places. nothing complicated unless antivaxx... case would rather come part. already got idiots deal with. anyway. Deal consequences later. ""but 100% effective"" also terrible argument getting vaccinated. vaccine anywhere close 100% effective. reason able eradicate certain diseases near-100% participation. People dont realize despite covid vaccines 100% effective, one effective vaccines ever created impressive amount people France. Protests France regularly draw 100k people. Remember Gilet Jaune protests years ago? 100k-500k protests going weeks. pretty violent too. Gotta admit, I'm really hoping booster less side effects 2nd shot. I'll get nonetheless, would nice spend another day bed. mom nurse long term care facility (nursing home + patients) said probably 25% nurse co-workers vaccinated. company mandating vaccine nurses next month get first shot fired. I'm worried overworked huge chunk co-workers get fired. Last year peak covid allow time worked 16 hour shifts weeks end. definitely think vaccine mandated medical staff protect patients. liberal state too. already happening certain large employers cascade society. going get difficult live normal life without vaccinated (Covid protections/ health benefits withstanding).

Just happening fast enough mean people throwing hands up. Unfortunately, free world, sometimes takes time cut red tape implement things necessary informed responsible populace.

Edit: way, we're team here. appreciate rational discussion. Good luck think realize important person learning is, multitude reasons. fact kids getting sick hospitalizations children seem rising, somewhat concerning. wish adults would grow wear mask (especially choose get vaccinated) would realize kids also okay wear masks. Jokes them: consequences vegan worse getting vaccine.

(i kid, kid) gets done cold, he'll safe one. keeps adding different individual viruses immunity repertoire, he'll less likely get several once. heavily England/UK coming US. indoors around unvaccinated people inconvenient.

I lived Korea 7 years left Covid arrived. worn masks 5 years due yellow dust (pollution know). prevented getting colds year. Likely contracted masked riding subway/buses. said, idea many colds would without wearing masks. likely stopped few. 

Koreans wear masks due yellow dust also get colds. Maybe result wearing masks, habit never blowing noses leads sniffling noise every 30 seconds cold, kind irritating. Cool... Just... cool. company operates ""SnapClinics"".

There‚Äôs widespread reporting ‚Äúlong flu‚Äù there‚Äôs widespread reporting flu anything. Covid news it‚Äôs new. flu old news one cares.

I think anti-mask person think argument through.  That‚Äôs actually rest good considering LA county slightly 50% fully vaccinated. Guessing teach middle school lmao  see point. However would rather run side caution kind thinking I'm safe early. seeing breakthrough cases, though deadly really severe, mutations still something take cautiously. Vaccinated people know gotten fun say. mention long term effects still learning about. understand people want stop lives completely sure hell don't, eating worth me. kind like saying smoking wont kill hasnt yet, continuing smoke knowing risks. However case, cigarettes evolving becoming addictive dangerous still dont know enough sure. Vaccinated people still asymptomatic transmission dont want cause someone elses illness. think ahead right now..just vaccines work right doesnt mean effective enough people dont get vaccinated mutates, serious cause concern right now. what? back square one worse virus little protection. dont think thats overblowing, definitely fun hear, possibility. People think big deal earlier yet no? Regardless spent way much time already lol safe friend thats all, want done bad anyone else! wrong think adverse affects vaccine likely severe reaction actual virus itself?  large protests, yes, French like protest. Overall vocal minority. people France seem pretty much aware what's going grandma around anymore. mention somewhere around 10% people tested positive. I.e. almost everyone knows someone it. Agreed. actually know someone vegan anti vax. vocal lot things, many evidence based. I'm hopeful speak rest community flu vaccine every year mutates rapidly. Covid hand mutates much slower flu.

The vaccines effective short term. unknown long last. vaccines last lifetime others need boosters. early tell right now. important thing realize want exhaust waste time. ""it's important try keep good perspective anti-mask folks different views own. responding perceive issues fairness truth."" statement na√Øve wrong. different views perceive issues fairness truth. hold views different express purpose spiting us

Not people express reservations mask use same. come many different angles viewpoints. (a small minority) anxiety problems make difficult wear mask. 

If ever hope succeed communication, focus things within control. within control listen person say respond way tune insulting intelligence / motives. 

If particular person talking (remember individuals) truly unreachable, hope regardless say either way. reachable, responding evil motives tune out. 

tldr - Treat people like people else get nowhere. something learned kindergarten. don‚Äôt want vax mask, there‚Äôs hospital bed ventilator available, is. Science wins. think assume kids catch COVID. risk low: 1/20,000 maybe. Compared driving 1,000 miles risk dying car accident 1/8,000 (1.25 per million miles) you. Vaccinated grandparents higher risk (1.3% CFR over-50s UK). muh untested don‚Äôt know Fauci saying *if* know it‚Äôs obviously going happen many Anti-Vaxxers ignore everything says. He‚Äôs basically talking brick wall point, we‚Äôre suffering alongside him.  get that. Still seems dicey lol, set precedent could, example, deny cancer treatment people smoked 20 years ago deny treatment problems ""stupid decisions."" idea would never work publicly funded healthcare system, nobody paying directly services rendered....they simply paying via taxes. would work America though, mostly private Healthcare system punish specific people. fundraising emails write themselves.

Yes every demo needs different tools point DC approach. Hope works  Hospitalizations even Texas prior waves, *new* hospitalizations (daily) much higher already hospitals overwhelmed. think Florida Louisiana worse.   Ok. Sorry, sucks. study says vaccinated people, covid mutation take place ? already know vaccinated people infected covid spread covid way less unvaccinated . lot gullible people join military, perfect certain jobs. 

I spend time helping vets get benefits often try talking others joining. I'd agree worldwide. think evenly matched Florida.  Nyc mandating vaccination restaurants effective Aug 16, enforcement start mid September used work biomedical research company which, like many others, working creating fast manufacturing technology exactly scenario (pandemic).

I know lot people don‚Äôt trust speed, science behind technology decades old.

In 60s, also took shitload (millions) eggs manufacture vaccine. We‚Äôve gotten much better last 60 years. Hospital workers also people, overwhelmed work ICU beds strictly limited. Doctors make decision gets ventilator, decide gets treatment doesn't. stories like Austin 6 ICU beds left Mississippi 6 open entire state. New Orleans total 88 ICU beds. support idea ""I want parties music festivals, want doctors, nurses, hospitals clean mess."" good idea. view selfish near sighted.  bunch vaccines, like worst vaccine ever invented.

A 50% contagious virus beginning make kids sick feels like huge slip wrong direction - that‚Äôs meant progress lost. feels like square one happening, really know? apologies though sounding dramatic. cringed bit read words back lol Killing young healthy without co-morbitities

0-17 age cohort 3 percent hospitalizations. neighbor reacted poorly said hoped district goes back masks required (kids young vaccinated yet).  argument kid asthma masks huge health risk reason. concern deadly virus impact ability breathe... Got.my 2 shots....not going 3rd thank much.  Interesting, thanks! know previous infection gives approximately 50% immunity vaccine gives you. Better nothing, nearly good vaccine, perfect protection itself. anti-vax specifically regard getting vaccinated covid. comply lose jobs

I know nothing military punishment, complying would likely worse consequences simply losing job, right? I'd think punishment disobeying orders would severe getting fired. least bit surprised someone would make comment know difference ""there"" ""they're."" time start auditing prosecuting... give nutters federal felony charge headlines already looks -- worst surge we've faced far

Yeah, that's bullshit. One clinics went kid similar policy. least Alabama governor finally speaking truth vaccines assholes refuse get them. Yeah but... others looking one two says otherwise so... trump card?

/s apply Biden? moderator comment referring to? quote? saying something work needs work 100% efficacy?! say that. 

You effectively say saying ""masks work"" ""masks work"" equally incorrect. maybe argue ""masks work"" oversimplification definitely incorrect ""masks work"" definitely went explain experts agree degree protecting spread well worth trivial effort mask wearing. takehome message.

And mind definition whether something works. work well enough worth cost it? works. reach threshold work. principle could apply pretty much every thing life. Hahahaha. meant dumb joke play ""The good (Insert whatever here) dead (Insert here). Obviously land. Eeek! want octogenarians die. Bad joke, bad. masks schools? Dude familiar military? can‚Äôt resign active military service, that‚Äôs works. mention they‚Äôre injected plethora god-only-knows-what join; don‚Äôt get ask you‚Äôre injected with/for, it‚Äôs none business.

*And clarify days, support face masks pandemic due state average intelligence general population, probably continue wearing even pandemic.* we're it, let's drop laws robbing banks, buying heroin, child pornography trust people right thing. fun. Yes, best analysis, covid become endemic live it. ever life seriously worried flu? ever changed life avoid flu? Covid likely become like next couple years.

However, covid vaccines much much better current flu shots. I'm claiming anything make vaccine irrelevant. big gap irrelevant good enough makes masking permanent thing past vaccinated (which original argument was). I'm saying data CDC used justify updated recommendation worrying enough makes sense vaccinated continue masking certain circumstances.  course not, I‚Äôm expressing frustration seems like every week rhetoric changing everything 988,000 active servicemembers 70% received least one dose far. means expect additional 296k vaccinated people mandate. good news. statistics useless ‚Äúother side‚Äù claiming Covid .0000000001% death rate divide deaths entire population world. everyone vaccinated breakthrough case even exposed Covid, using total number vaccinations state 99.9% severe breakthrough case, true, misleading AF. maybe third dose vaccine updated variant lol. specified, believe mask vaccines seem work implemented. guy throws bunch things around. curious hear someone knowledge he's correct correct."
